# BOOK	008	RUT	Ruth	Ruth
008	RUT	001	001	In the time when the judges ruled, there was once a famine in the land. A man from Bethlehem in Judah took his wife and two sons to live in the territory of Moab.
008	RUT	001	002	His name was Elimelech and his wife’s was Naomi, and his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion. They were Ephrathites from Bethlehem in Judah. After they had been living in Moab for some time,
008	RUT	001	003	Elimelech died, and Naomi was left with her two sons,
008	RUT	001	004	who married Moabite women named Orpah and Ruth. After they had lived there about ten years,
008	RUT	001	005	Mahlon and Chilion both died, and Naomi was left alone, without husband or sons.
008	RUT	001	006	So she set out with her daughters-in-law to return from the land of Moab, for she had heard that the Lord had remembered his people and given them food.
008	RUT	001	007	As they were setting out together on the journey to Judah,
008	RUT	001	008	Naomi said to her daughters-in-law, ‘Go, return both of you to the home of your mother. May the Lord be kind to you as you have been kind to the dead and to me.
008	RUT	001	009	The Lord grant that each of you may find peace and happiness in the house of a new husband.’ Then she kissed them; but they began to weep aloud
008	RUT	001	010	and said to her, ‘No, we will return with you to your people.’
008	RUT	001	011	But Naomi said, ‘Go back, my daughters. Why should you go with me? Can I still bear sons who might become your husbands?
008	RUT	001	012	Go back, my daughters, go your own way, because I am too old to have a husband. Even if I should say, “I have hope,” even if I should have a husband tonight and should bear sons,
008	RUT	001	013	would you wait for them until they were grown up? Would you remain single for them? No, my daughters! My heart grieves for you, for the Lord has sent me adversity.’
008	RUT	001	014	Then they again wept aloud, and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law goodbye, but Ruth stayed with her.
008	RUT	001	015	‘Look,’ said Naomi, ‘your sister-in-law is going back to her own people and to her own gods. Go along with her!’
008	RUT	001	016	But Ruth answered, ‘Do not urge me to leave you or to go back. I will go where you go, and I will stay wherever you stay. Your people will be my people, and your God my God;
008	RUT	001	017	I will die where you die, and be buried there. May the Lord bring a curse upon me, if anything but death separate you and me.’
008	RUT	001	018	When Naomi saw that Ruth was determined to go with her, she ceased urging her to return.
008	RUT	001	019	So they journeyed on until they came to Bethlehem. Their arrival stirred the whole town, and the women said, ‘Can this be Naomi?’
008	RUT	001	020	‘Do not call me Naomi,’ she said to them, ‘call me Mara, for the Almighty has given me a bitter lot.
008	RUT	001	021	I had plenty when I left, but the Lord has brought me back empty handed. Why should you call me Naomi, now that the Lord has afflicted me, and the Almighty has brought misfortune on me?’
008	RUT	001	022	So Naomi and Ruth, her Moabite daughter-in-law, returned from Moab. They reached Bethlehem at the beginning of the barley harvest.
008	RUT	002	001	Now Naomi was related through her husband to a very wealthy man of the family of Elimelech named Boaz.
008	RUT	002	002	Ruth the Moabite said to Naomi, ‘Let me now go into the fields and gather leftover grain behind anyone who will allow me.’ ‘Go, my daughter,’ she replied.
008	RUT	002	003	So she went to glean in the field after the reapers. As it happened, she was in that part of the field which belonged to Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech.
008	RUT	002	004	When Boaz came from Bethlehem and said to the reapers, ‘The Lord be with you,’ they answered him, ‘May the Lord bless you.’
008	RUT	002	005	‘Whose girl is this?’ Boaz asked his servant who had charge of the reapers.
008	RUT	002	006	The servant who had charge of the reapers replied, ‘It is the Moabite girl who came back with Naomi from the territory of Moab.
008	RUT	002	007	She asked to be allowed to glean and gather sheaves after the reapers. So she came and has continued to work until now and she has not rested a moment in the field.’
008	RUT	002	008	Then Boaz said to Ruth, ‘Listen, my daughter. Do not go to glean in another field nor leave this place, but stay here with my girls.
008	RUT	002	009	Watch where the men are reaping and follow the gleaners. I have told the young men not to trouble you. When you are thirsty, go to the jars and drink of that which the young men have drawn.’
008	RUT	002	010	Then she bowed low and said to him, ‘Why are you so kind to me, to take interest in me when I am just a foreigner?’
008	RUT	002	011	Boaz replied, ‘I have heard what you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband, and how you left your father and mother and your native land to come to a people that you did not know before.
008	RUT	002	012	May the Lord repay you for what you have done, and may you be fully rewarded by the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge.’
008	RUT	002	013	Then she said, ‘I trust I may please you, my lord, for you have comforted me and spoken kindly to your servant, although I am not really equal to one of your own servants.’
008	RUT	002	014	At mealtime Boaz said to Ruth, ‘Come here and eat some of the food and dip your piece of bread in the vinegar.’ So she sat beside the reapers, and he passed her some roasted grain. She ate until she was satisfied and had some left.
008	RUT	002	015	When she rose to glean, Boaz gave this order to his young men: ‘Let her glean even among the sheaves and do not disturb her.
008	RUT	002	016	Also pull out some for her from the bundles and leave for her to glean, and do not find fault with her.’
008	RUT	002	017	So she gleaned in the field until evening, then beat out what she had gleaned. It was about a bushel of barley.
008	RUT	002	018	Then she took it up and went into the town and showed her mother-in-law what she had gleaned. She also brought out and gave her that which she had left from her meal after she had had enough.
008	RUT	002	019	‘Where did you glean today, and where did you work?’ asked her mother-in-law. ‘A blessing on him who took notice of you!’ So she told her mother-in-law where she had worked. ‘The name of the man with whom I worked today,’ she said, ‘is Boaz.’
008	RUT	002	020	Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, ‘May the blessing of the Lord rest on this man who has not ceased to show his loving-kindness to the living and to the dead. The man,’ she added, ‘is a near relation of ours.’
008	RUT	002	021	‘He told me,’ Ruth said, ‘that I must keep near his young men until they have completed all his harvest.’
008	RUT	002	022	Naomi said to Ruth, ‘It is best, my daughter, that you should go out with his girls because you might not be as safe in another field.’
008	RUT	002	023	So she gleaned with the girls of Boaz until the end of the barley and wheat harvest; but she lived with her mother-in-law.
008	RUT	003	001	One day, Naomi said to Ruth, ‘My daughter, should I not seek to secure a home for you where you will be happy and prosperous?
008	RUT	003	002	Is not Boaz, with whose girls you have been, a relative of ours?
008	RUT	003	003	Tonight he is going to winnow barley on the threshing-floor. So bathe and anoint yourself and put on your best clothes and go down to the threshing-floor. But do not make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking.
008	RUT	003	004	Then when he lies down, mark the place where he lies. Go in, uncover his feet, lie down, and then he will tell you what to do.’
008	RUT	003	005	‘I will do as you say.’ Ruth said to her.
008	RUT	003	006	So she went down to the threshing-floor and did just as her mother-in-law told her.
008	RUT	003	007	When Boaz had finished eating and drinking and was in a happy mood, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain. Then Ruth came quietly and uncovered his feet and lay down.
008	RUT	003	008	At midnight the man was startled and turned over, and there was a woman lying at his feet!
008	RUT	003	009	‘Who are you?’ he said. ‘I am Ruth your servant,’ she answered, ‘Spread your cloak over your servant, for you are a near relative.’
008	RUT	003	010	He said, ‘May you be blest by the Lord, my daughter. You have shown me greater favour now than at first, for you have not followed young men, whether poor or rich.
008	RUT	003	011	My daughter, have no fear. I will do for you all that you ask, for the whole town knows that you are a virtuous woman.
008	RUT	003	012	Now it is true that I am a near relative, but there is another man nearer than I.
008	RUT	003	013	Stay here tonight, and then in the morning, if he will perform for you the duty of a kinsman, well, let him do it. But if he will not perform for you the duty of a kinsman, then as surely as the Lord lives, I will do it for you. Lie down until morning.’
008	RUT	003	014	So she lay at his feet until morning, but rose before anyone could recognise her, for Boaz said, ‘No one must know that a woman came to the threshing-floor.’
008	RUT	003	015	He also said, ‘Bring the cloak which you have on and hold it.’ So she held it while he poured into it six measures of barley and laid it on her shoulders. Then he went into the city.
008	RUT	003	016	When Ruth came to her mother-in-law, Naomi asked, ‘Is it you, my daughter?’ Then Ruth told Naomi all that the man had done for her.
008	RUT	003	017	‘He gave me these six measures of barley,’ she said, ‘for he said I should not go to my mother-in-law empty-handed.’
008	RUT	003	018	‘Wait quietly, my daughter.’ Naomi said, ‘Until you know how the affair will turn out, for the man will not rest unless he settles it all today.’
008	RUT	004	001	Then Boaz went up to the gate and sat down. Just then the near kinsman of whom Boaz had spoken came along. Boaz said, ‘Hello, So-and-so (calling him by name), come here and sit down.’ So he stopped and sat down.
008	RUT	004	002	Boaz also took ten of the town elders and said, ‘Sit down here.’ So they sat down.
008	RUT	004	003	Then he said to the near relative, ‘Naomi, who has come back from the country of Moab, is offering for sale the piece of land which belonged to our relative Elimelech,
008	RUT	004	004	and I thought that I would lay the matter before you, suggesting that you buy it in the presence of these men who sit here and of the elders of my people. If you will buy it and so keep it in the possession of the family, do so; but if not; then tell me, so that I may know; for no one but you has the right to buy it, and I am next to you.’ ‘I will buy it,’ he said.
008	RUT	004	005	Then Boaz said, ‘On the day you buy the field from Naomi, you must also marry Ruth the Moabite, the widow of the dead, in order to preserve the name of the dead in connection with his inheritance.’
008	RUT	004	006	‘I cannot buy it for myself without spoiling my own inheritance,’ the near relative said. ‘You take my right of buying it as a relative, because I cannot do so.’
008	RUT	004	007	Now this used to be the custom in Israel: to make valid anything relating to a matter of redemption or exchange, a man drew off his sandal and gave it to the other man; and this was the way contracts were attested in Israel.
008	RUT	004	008	So when the near relative said to Boaz, ‘Buy it for yourself,’ Boaz drew off the man’s sandal.
008	RUT	004	009	Then Boaz said to the elders and to all the people, ‘You are witnesses at this time that I have bought all that was Elimelech’s and all that was Chilion’s and Mahlon’s from Naomi.
008	RUT	004	010	Moreover I have secured Ruth the Moabite, the wife of Mahlon, to be my wife, in order to perpetuate the name of the dead in connection with his inheritance, so that his name will not disappear from among his relatives and from the household where he lived. You are witnesses this day.’
008	RUT	004	011	Then all the people who were at the gate and the elders said, ‘We are witnesses. May the Lord make the woman who is coming into your house like Rachel and Leah, who together built the house of Israel. May you do well in Ephrata, and become famous in Bethlehem.
008	RUT	004	012	From the children whom the Lord will give you by this young woman may your household become like the household of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah.’
008	RUT	004	013	So Boaz married Ruth, and she became his wife; and the Lord gave to her a son.
008	RUT	004	014	Then the women said to Naomi, ‘Blessed be the Lord who has not left you at this time without a near relative, and may his name be famous in Israel.
008	RUT	004	015	This child will restore your vigor and nourish you in your old age; for your daughter-in-law who loves you, who is worth more to you than seven sons, has borne a son to Boaz!’
008	RUT	004	016	So Naomi took the child in her arms and cared for him as if he was her own.
008	RUT	004	017	The women of the neighbourhood gave him a name, saying, ‘A son is born to Naomi!’ They named him Obed. He became the father of Jesse, who was the father of David.
008	RUT	004	018	This is the genealogy of Perez: Perez was the father of Hezron,
008	RUT	004	019	Hezron of Ram, Ram of Amminadab,
008	RUT	004	020	Amminidab of Nashon, Nashon of Salmon,
008	RUT	004	021	Salmon of Boaz, Boaz of Obed,
008	RUT	004	022	Obed of Jesse, Jesse of David.

# BOOK	017	EST	Esther	Esther
017	EST	001	001	These events happened in the time of Ahasuerus, who ruled over a hundred and twenty-seven provinces from India to Ethiopia
017	EST	001	002	from his royal throne in the fortified palace of Susa.
017	EST	001	003	In the third year of his reign, the king gave a feast for all his officers and courtiers. The commanders of the military forces of Persia and Media, the nobles and provincial rulers were present
017	EST	001	004	while for one hundred and eighty days he showed them the glorious riches of his kingdom and the costliness of his magnificent regalia.
017	EST	001	005	When these days were ended, the king held a banquet for all the people who were present in the royal palace at Susa, high and low alike. It was a seven days’ feast in the enclosed garden of the royal palace.
017	EST	001	006	There were white and violet cotton curtains fastened to silver rings and pillars of marble with cords of fine purple wool and linen. The couches were of gold and silver placed upon a mosaic pavement of alabaster, white marble, mother-of-pearl, and dark stone.
017	EST	001	007	Drink was brought in vessels of gold – which were all different – and the king’s wine was provided with royal liberality.
017	EST	001	008	The drinking was unrestricted, for the king had directed all the officers of his household to let each man do as he pleased.
017	EST	001	009	Queen Vashti also gave a feast for the women in the King Ahasuerus’ royal palace.
017	EST	001	010	On the seventh day, when the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zathar and Carkas, his seven eunuch attendants
017	EST	001	011	to bring Queen Vashti before him with the royal diadem on her head, to show her beauty to the people and the officials, for she was very beautiful.
017	EST	001	012	But Queen Vashti refused to come as the king commanded through the eunuchs. Then the king became very angry and his fury burned within him.
017	EST	001	013	The king turned to the wise men who knew the precedents, for it was his custom to confer with those wise in law.
017	EST	001	014	Those next to him were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena and Memucan, seven officials of Persia and Media who had access to the king and were highest in the kingdom.
017	EST	001	015	‘Queen Vashti’, the king said, ‘has failed to obey my royal command – the command of King Ahasuerus conveyed through the eunuchs! What does the law say should be done to her?’
017	EST	001	016	Memucan replied before the king and the officials, ‘Queen Vashti has done wrong not only to the king but also to all the officials and to all the peoples in all of the king’s provinces.
017	EST	001	017	The refusal of the queen will be reported to all the women with the result that it will make them despise their husbands. They will say, “King Ahasuerus commanded Queen Vashti to be brought in before him, but she did not come!”
017	EST	001	018	This very day the ladies of Persia and Media who have heard of the refusal of the queen will tell it to all the king’s officials, and there will be contempt and strife!
017	EST	001	019	If it seems best to the king, let him send out a royal edict. Let it be written among the laws of Persia and Media, never to be repealed, that Vashti may never again come before King Ahasuerus. Let the king give her place as queen to another who is more worthy than she.
017	EST	001	020	When the king’s decree which he makes is heard throughout his kingdom – great as it is – the wives of all classes will give honour to their husbands.’
017	EST	001	021	The proposal pleased the king and the officials, and the king did as Memucan advised.
017	EST	001	022	He sent letters to all the provinces, to every province in its own system of writing and to every people in their language, that every man should be master in his own house!
017	EST	002	001	Some time later, when the wrath of King Ahasuerus had subsided, he remembered what Vashti had done and what had been decreed against her.
017	EST	002	002	Then the king’s servants who waited upon him said, ‘Let beautiful young virgins be sought for the king,
017	EST	002	003	and let the king appoint commissioners to all the provinces of his kingdom to gather them all to Susa the royal residence. Let them be brought into the women’s quarters under the custody of Hegai, the king’s eunuch, who has charge of the women. Then give them what is needed to make them beautiful,
017	EST	002	004	and let the girl who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti.’ The proposal pleased the king so he put it into action.
017	EST	002	005	In Susa the royal residence lived a Jew named Mordecai. He was son of Jair, son of Shimei, son of Kish, a Benjamite.
017	EST	002	006	(Kish had been carried away from Jerusalem with the exiles who were deported with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon took captive.)
017	EST	002	007	Mordecai had adopted Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle’s daughter, since she had neither father nor mother. The girl was shapely and beautiful; and after her father and mother died, Mordecai raised her as if she was his own daughter.
017	EST	002	008	When the king’s command and decree were known, many girls were gathered together to Susa the capital under the custody of Hegai. Esther was also taken into the king’s palace and placed under the custody of Hegai, who had charge of the women.
017	EST	002	009	The girl pleased him and gained his favour, so that he quickly gave her the cosmetics she needed to enhance her beauty and her allowance of food and the seven maids selected from the king’s household. He also transferred her and her maids to the best place in the harem.
017	EST	002	010	Esther had not revealed her people nor her family background because Mordecai had ordered her not to.
017	EST	002	011	Every day Mordecai would walk in front of the courtyard of the harem and ask after Esther’s health and what was happening to her.
017	EST	002	012	The girls were prepared for meeting King Ahasuerus for twelve months: six months being treated with oil of myrrh and six months with perfumes and cosmetics. After the twelve months,
017	EST	002	013	each girl went in to the king. She was allowed to take with her whatever she wished from the women’s quarters,
017	EST	002	014	and would enter the palace in the evening and return the next morning to another part of the harem under the care of the king’s eunuch Shaashgaz who was in charge of concubines. She would not go to the king again unless he desired her and summoned her by name.
017	EST	002	015	When it was the turn of Esther (the girl adopted by Mordecai, daughter of his uncle Abihail) to go in to the king, she only took with her those things that Hegai, the king’s eunuch in charge of the women, had advised her to take. Esther was liked by all who saw her.
017	EST	002	016	Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus in the royal palace in the tenth month, the month of Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.
017	EST	002	017	And the king loved her more than all the other women, and she became his favourite and won his affection. He placed the royal diadem on her head and made her queen instead of Vashti.
017	EST	002	018	Then the king gave a great feast to all his officials and courtiers in honour of Esther, and he remitted the taxes of the provinces and distributed gifts with royal liberality.
017	EST	002	019	All the time the virgins were assembled again, Mordecai was sitting as an offical at the king’s gate.
017	EST	002	020	Esther had not revealed her people or family background because she still obeyed him as she had when he was bringing her up.
017	EST	002	021	In those days while Mordecai was sitting in the king’s gate, two of the royal court attendants, Bigthan and Teresh, who guarded the entrance of the palace, became enraged and attempted to kill King Ahasuerus.
017	EST	002	022	But Mordecai learned of the conspiracy and disclosed it to Queen Esther, and she told the king on Mordecai’s behalf.
017	EST	002	023	When the affair was investigated and the facts discovered, the conspirators were both hanged on the gallows. The incident was recorded in the presence of the king in the daily record of events.
017	EST	003	001	After these events King Ahasuerus promoted Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him to a place above all the officials who were with him.
017	EST	003	002	All the king’s courtiers who were in the king’s gate used to bow down before Haman, for so the king had commanded, but Mordecai did not bow down nor prostrate himself.
017	EST	003	003	Then the king’s courtiers, who were in the king’s gate, said to Mordecai, ‘Why do you disobey the king’s command?’
017	EST	003	004	When they had spoken to him day after day without his listening to them, they informed Haman, to see whether Mordecai’s acts would be tolerated, for he had told them that he was a Jew.
017	EST	003	005	When Haman saw that Mordecai did not bow down nor prostrate himself before him, he was furious.
017	EST	003	006	But it seemed to him beneath his dignity to lay hands on Mordecai alone, for they had told him who Mordecai’s people were. Instead Haman sought to destroy all the people of Mordecai, all the Jews throughout the kingdom of Ahasuerus.
017	EST	003	007	In the first month (the month of Nisan) in the twelfth year of the reign of King Ahasuerus, Haman had “pur” (which means “lot”) cast before him to determine the best day and best month for his actions. The lot fell on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month – the month of Adar.
017	EST	003	008	So Haman said to King Ahasuerus, ‘There is a certain people scattered among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom, whose laws differ from those of every other and who do not keep the king’s laws. Therefore it is not right for the king to tolerate them.
017	EST	003	009	If it seems best to the king, let an order be given to destroy them, and I will pay ten thousand silver coins into the royal treasury.’
017	EST	003	010	So the king took off his signet ring from his hand and gave it to Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemy of the Jews.
017	EST	003	011	‘The money is yours,’ the king said to Haman, ‘and the people also to do with them as you wish.’
017	EST	003	012	And so, on the thirteenth day of the first month, the king’s secretaries were summoned and as Haman instructed an edict was issued to the king’s satraps and provincial governors and the rulers of each of the peoples in their own script and their own language. The edict was written in the name of King Ahasuerus and sealed with his ring.
017	EST	003	013	Dispatches were sent by couriers to all the king’s provinces, saying: Destroy, kill, put an end to all the Jews, young and old, little children and women, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, and plunder their possessions.
017	EST	003	014	A copy of the edict was to be published as a decree in every province – publicly displayed so that everyone might be ready for that day.
017	EST	003	015	By command of the king the couriers raced off, and the edict was published in Susa itself. Then the king and Haman sat down to drink, but the city of Susa was in turmoil.
017	EST	004	001	When Mordecai learned all that had been done, he tore his clothes and put on sackcloth and strewed ashes on his head, and went out into the city and raised a loud and bitter cry of lamentation.
017	EST	004	002	He went as far as the king’s gate, but no one could enter the gate clothed with sackcloth.
017	EST	004	003	In every province, wherever the king’s command and decree went, there was great mourning, fasting, weeping, and wailing among the Jews. Many of them sat in sackcloth and ashes.
017	EST	004	004	When Esther’s maids and attendants told her about Mordecai’s behaviour, she was greatly troubled. She sent garments for Mordecai to put on, so that he could take off his sack-cloth, but he would not accept them.
017	EST	004	005	So Esther called Hathach, one of the king’s eunuchs whom he had appointed to attend her, and ordered him to go to Mordecai to learn what it all meant and the reason for it.
017	EST	004	006	So Hathach went out to Mordecai, to the city square in front of the king’s gate.
017	EST	004	007	Mordecai told him all that had happened to him and the exact amount of money that Haman had promised to pay into the king’s treasury for the destruction of the Jews.
017	EST	004	008	Also he gave him a copy of the decree to destroy them, that had been published in Susa, to show to Esther for her information. He also told her to go to the king and implore his mercy and to plead with him in behalf of her people.
017	EST	004	009	When Hathach came and told Esther what Mordecai had said,
017	EST	004	010	she instructed Hathach to go and say to Mordecai,
017	EST	004	011	‘All the king’s courtiers and the people of the king’s provinces know that for every man or woman who goes to the king into the inner court without being called there is one penalty, death, unless the king holds out the golden sceptre signifying that they may live. It has been thirty days since I have been called to go in to the king.’
017	EST	004	012	When Mordecai was told what Esther had said,
017	EST	004	013	he sent back this reply to Esther, ‘Don’t imagine that you alone of all the Jews will escape because you belong to the king’s household.
017	EST	004	014	If you persist in remaining silent at this time, relief and deliverance will come to the Jews from another quarter, but you and your family will perish. Who knows? Maybe you have been raised to the throne for a time like this!’
017	EST	004	015	Then Esther sent this message to Mordecai:
017	EST	004	016	‘Go, gather all the Jews in Susa and fast for me. Don’t eat nor drink anything for three days and nights. My maids and I will fast as well. Then I will go in to the king, although it is contrary to the law, and if I die, I die.’
017	EST	004	017	Mordecai did everything Esther had directed.
017	EST	005	001	On the third day, Esther put on her regalia and stood in the inner court of the royal palace opposite the king’s house. The king was sitting on his throne in the palace, opposite the entrance.
017	EST	005	002	When he saw Esther the queen standing in the court, she won his favour, and he held out to her the golden sceptre that was in his hand. So Esther approached and touched the top of the sceptre.
017	EST	005	003	Then the king said to her, ‘What is it, Queen Esther? Whatever your request is, it will be granted, even if it is the half of the kingdom.’
017	EST	005	004	‘If it seems best to the king,’ Esther said, ‘let the king and Haman come today to the banquet that I have prepared for him.’
017	EST	005	005	Then the king ordered, ‘Bring Haman quickly, so that Esther’s wish may be gratified.’ So the king and Haman went to the banquet that Esther had prepared.
017	EST	005	006	While they were drinking wine, the king said to Esther, ‘Whatever your petition is, it will be granted. Your request, it will be done – even if it takes half of my kingdom.’
017	EST	005	007	Esther answered,
017	EST	005	008	‘If I have won the king’s favour and if it seems best to the king to grant my petition and to accede to my request, my petition and my request are that the king and Haman come to the banquet which I will prepare for them. Tomorrow I will answer the king’s question as he wishes.’
017	EST	005	009	Haman went out that day joyful and elated, but when he saw Mordecai in the king’s gate and noticed that he neither stood up nor moved for him, he was furiously angry with Mordecai.
017	EST	005	010	Nevertheless Haman restrained himself and went home. He called together his friends and Zeresh his wife
017	EST	005	011	and recounted to them the greatness of his wealth, how many children he had, and all the ways in which the king had honoured him, and how he had promoted him above the officials and the royal courtiers.
017	EST	005	012	‘What is more,’ Haman said, ‘Queen Esther brought no one in with the king to the banquet which she had prepared except me, and tomorrow also I am invited by her along with the king.
017	EST	005	013	Yet all this does not satisfy me as long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king’s gate.’
017	EST	005	014	Then Zeresh his wife and all his friends said to him, ‘Let a gallows seventy-five feet high be erected, and in the morning speak to the king and let Mordecai be hanged on it. Then go merrily with the king to the banquet.’ The advice pleased Haman, and so he had the gallows erected.
017	EST	006	001	On that night the king was unable to sleep, so he gave orders to bring the books that recorded memorable deeds, and they were read before the king.
017	EST	006	002	It was found recorded how Mordecai had furnished information regarding Bigthan and Teresh, two of the king’s attendants who guarded the entrance of the palace, who had attempted to kill King Ahasuerus.
017	EST	006	003	‘What honour and dignity have been conferred on Mordecai for this?’ the king asked. When the king’s pages who waited on him replied ‘Nothing has been done for him,’
017	EST	006	004	the king said, ‘Who is in the court?’ Now Haman had just entered the outer court of the king’s house to speak to the king about hanging Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him.
017	EST	006	005	So the king’s pages said to him, ‘Haman is standing there, in the court.’ The king said, ‘Let him enter.’
017	EST	006	006	So Haman entered, and the king said to him, ‘What should be done for the man whom the king wishes to honour?’ Haman said to himself, ‘Whom besides me could the king wish to honour?’
017	EST	006	007	So he said to the king, ‘For the man whom the king wishes to honour
017	EST	006	008	let a royal garment be brought, which the king has worn, and the horse on which the king has ridden and on whose head a royal diadem has been placed.
017	EST	006	009	Then let the garment and the horse be placed in charge of one of the king’s noble officials. Let him clothe the man whom the king wishes to honour and let him lead that man on the horse through the city square, proclaiming before him, “This is what is done for the man whom the king wishes to honour.”’
017	EST	006	010	Then the king said to Haman, ‘Make haste and take the garment and the horse, as you have said, and do this to Mordecai the Jew, who sits in the king’s gate. Omit nothing of all you have said.’
017	EST	006	011	So Haman took the garment and the horse and clothed Mordecai, and made him ride through the city square and proclaimed before him, ‘This is what is done for the man whom the king wishes to honour.’
017	EST	006	012	Mordecai returned to the king’s gate, but Haman hurried to his house, mourning, with his head covered.
017	EST	006	013	Haman recounted to Zeresh his wife and to all his friends everything that had happened to him. Then his wise men and Zeresh his wife said to him, ‘If Mordecai before whom you have already been humiliated is of the Jewish people, you can do nothing against him but will surely fall before him.’
017	EST	006	014	While they were still talking with him, the king’s attendants came and quickly took Haman to the banquet that Esther had prepared.
017	EST	007	001	So the king and Haman went to drink with Queen Esther.
017	EST	007	002	As they were drinking wine on that second day, the king again said to Esther, ‘Whatever your petition is, Queen Esther, it will be granted to you. Whatever you request it will be done, even if it takes half of the kingdom.’
017	EST	007	003	Then Queen Esther answered, ‘Your Majesty, if I have won your favour, and if it seems best to Your Majesty, let my life be given me as my petition, and my people as my request,
017	EST	007	004	for I and my people have been sold to be destroyed, killed, and completely annihilated! If we had been merely sold into slavery I would not have disturbed your peace, because such a fate would not have affected the interests of the king.’
017	EST	007	005	Then King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther, ‘Who is he and where is he whose heart has impelled him to do this?’
017	EST	007	006	‘A foe, an enemy: this wicked Haman.’ Esther answered. Haman shrank in terror before the king and the queen.
017	EST	007	007	In his wrath the king rose from the place where he was drinking wine and went into the palace garden. Haman stayed to beg Queen Esther for his life, for he saw that the king was fully determined to bring calamity upon him.
017	EST	007	008	As the king returned from the palace garden to the banquet hall, Haman had flung himself on Esther’s couch. The king cried, ‘Is he going to rape my queen while I am present in my own house?’ As the king spoke these words, the attendants covered Haman’s face
017	EST	007	009	and Harbonah, one of those who waited on the king, said, ‘There are the gallows, seventy-five feet high, which Hainan erected for Mordecai, who spoke a good word in behalf of the king, standing in the house of Haman!’ The king said ‘Hang him on them.’
017	EST	007	010	So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then the wrath of the king was pacified.
017	EST	008	001	At that time King Ahasuerus gave the property of Haman the Jews’ enemy to Queen Esther. Mordecai was made one of the king’s personal advisers, for Esther had disclosed his relationship to her.
017	EST	008	002	The king also drew off his signet ring, which he had taken from Haman. He gave it to Mordecai, and Esther placed Mordecai in charge of Haman’s property.
017	EST	008	003	Then Esther sought another audience with the king and fell at his feet and with tears begged him to avert the evil planned by Haman the Agagite and to frustrate his designs against the Jews.
017	EST	008	004	The king held out to her the golden sceptre, and she arose and stood before him.
017	EST	008	005	‘If it seems best to the king,’ she said, ‘and if I have won his favour and he thinks it right, and if I please him, let written orders be given to revoke the dispatches devised by Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote ordering the destruction of the Jews who are in all the king’s provinces.
017	EST	008	006	For how can I bear to look upon the evil that will come to my people? How can I bear to see their destruction?’
017	EST	008	007	Then King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther and to Mordecai the Jew, ‘See, I have given Esther the property of Haman, and they have hanged him on the gallows, because he laid hands upon the Jews.
017	EST	008	008	Now you write on behalf of the Jews, as seems best to you, in the king’s name and seal it with the king’s signet ring. For a document that is written in the king’s name and sealed with the king’s signet ring cannot be revoked.’
017	EST	008	009	On the twenty-third day of the third month (that is the month of Sivan), the king’s secretaries were summoned and as Mordecai instructed an edict was issued to the Jews, to the satraps and provincial governors and the rulers of each of the one hundred twenty-seven provinces from India to Ethiopia in their own script and their own language, and to the Jews in their own script and language.
017	EST	008	010	Mordecai wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus. He sealed it with the king’s signet ring. Dispatches were sent by mounted couriers who rode the swift, noble steeds, bred of the royal studs.
017	EST	008	011	In this way the king permitted the Jews who were in every city to gather together and make a stand for their life, to destroy, to kill, and annihilate all the armed forces of any people or province that might be hostile to them, including their children and women, and to take their goods as plunder
017	EST	008	012	throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus on that thirteenth day of the twelfth month (which is called Adar).
017	EST	008	013	A copy of the edict was to be published as a decree in every province – publicly displayed so that the Jews might be ready for that day and avenge themselves.
017	EST	008	014	So the couriers who rode the swift, noble steeds went out, hastened and impelled by the king’s commands! Meantime the decree had been given out in the royal palace at Susa;
017	EST	008	015	and Mordecai had gone out from the presence of the king in royal garments of violet and white and with a great crown of gold and with a robe of fine linen and purple. The people of Susa shouted and were glad.
017	EST	008	016	To the Jews there came light and gladness and joy and honour.
017	EST	008	017	And in every province and city, wherever the king’s command and decree came, there was gladness and joy among the Jews and a holiday. Many of the peoples of the earth professed to be Jews, for fear of the Jews took possession of them.
017	EST	009	001	Now in the twelfth month (that is the month of Adar), on the thirteenth day, when the king’s command and his decree was about to put into execution, on the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to gain the mastery over them, then the tables were turned so that the Jews had the mastery over those who hated them.
017	EST	009	002	The Jews gathered together in the cities throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, to attack anyone who tried to harm them. No one could withstand them, for the fear of them had fallen on all the peoples.
017	EST	009	003	All the princes of the provinces and the satraps and the governors and they who attended to the king’s business, helped the Jews, because the fear of Mordecai had fallen on them.
017	EST	009	004	For Mordecai was great in the king’s palace, and as his power increased his fame spread throughout all the provinces.
017	EST	009	005	The Jews put all their enemies to the sword and, with slaughter and destruction, they did what they wanted to those who hated them.
017	EST	009	006	In Susa the capital the Jews killed five hundred people.
017	EST	009	007	They killed Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha,
017	EST	009	008	Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha,
017	EST	009	009	Parmashta, Arisia, Aridai, and Vaizatha,
017	EST	009	010	the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Jews’ enemy; but they did not take any plunder.
017	EST	009	011	On that day the number of those who were slain in Susa was brought before the king,
017	EST	009	012	and the king said to Queen Esther, ‘The Jews have slain five hundred people in Susa, and the ten sons of Haman. What then have they done in the rest of the king’s provinces! Now what is your petition? It will be granted to you. What is your request? It will be done.’
017	EST	009	013	‘If it please the king,’ Esther said, ‘let it be granted to the Jews who are in Susa to do tomorrow also according to this day’s decree. Let the bodies of Haman’s ten sons be hanged on the gallows.’
017	EST	009	014	And the king commanded it to be done. A decree was given out in Susa and they hung the bodies of Haman’s ten sons on the gallows.
017	EST	009	015	The Jews who were in Susa gathered themselves together again on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar. They killed three hundred people in Susa. But they did not take any plunder.
017	EST	009	016	And the other Jews who were in the king’s provinces gathered themselves together and fought for their lives and overcame their enemies. They killed seventy-five thousand who hated them. But they did not take any plunder.
017	EST	009	017	This was on the thirteenth day of Adar. On the fourteenth day of the month Adar the Jews rested and made it a day of feasting and rejoicing.
017	EST	009	018	(But the Jews in Susa gathered on both the thirteenth and fourteenth day – and rested on the fifteenth day of the same month and made it a day of feasting and rejoicing.)
017	EST	009	019	This is why the Jews who live in the country villages keep the fourteenth day of the month of Adar as a day of rejoicing and feasting and a holiday, and a day in which they send gifts of food to each other.
017	EST	009	020	Mordecai had these things recorded. He sent letters to all the Jews who were in all the provinces of the King Ahasuerus, both near and far.
017	EST	009	021	He told them to keep the fourteenth day of the month of Adar and also the fifteenth day every year,
017	EST	009	022	as the days on which the Jews had rest from their enemies, and the month which was turned from sorrow to gladness and from mourning into a feast day. They should make them days of feasting and gladness and of sending gifts of food to each other and of gifts to the poor.
017	EST	009	023	So what the Jews had begun to do they adopted as a custom, just as Mordecai had written to them.
017	EST	009	024	For Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted to destroy them. He had cast “Pur”, that is the lot, intending to consume them and to destroy them.
017	EST	009	025	But when the matter came before the king, he gave written orders that his wicked plot, which he had planned against the Jews, should come upon his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.
017	EST	009	026	This is why these days are called Purim, after the word Pur. Therefore because of all the words of this letter, as well as all they had seen, and all they had experienced,
017	EST	009	027	the Jews established and made it a custom for them, for their descendants, and for all who should join them, so that it might not be repealed, that they should continue to observe these two days as feasts each year,
017	EST	009	028	and that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city. And these days of Purim should not pass away from among the Jews nor the remembrance of them disappear among their descendants.
017	EST	009	029	Queen Esther, the daughter of Abihail, gave Mordecai the Jew all authority in writing to confirm this second letter of Purim.
017	EST	009	030	He sent letters to all the Jews, to the hundred and twenty-seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, wishing them peace and security,
017	EST	009	031	to confirm these days of Purim in their proper times, to be observed as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther had directed and as the Jews had proscribed for themselves and their descendants, in the matter of the fastings and their cry of lamentation.
017	EST	009	032	And the commands of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was written in the records.
017	EST	010	001	King Ahasuerus imposed a tribute on the land and the coasts.
017	EST	010	002	All the acts of his power and of his might, and the full account of the greatness of Mordecai to which the king advanced him, are they not recorded in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia?
017	EST	010	003	For Mordecai the Jew was next in rank to King Ahasuerus, and great among the Jews, and loved by them all. He sought the good of his people and promoted the welfare of their descendants.

019	PSA	001	001	Happy are those who do not follow the counsel of the wicked, not halting in ways frequented by sinners, nor taking a seat in a gathering of scoffers.
019	PSA	001	002	But the law of the Lord is their joy, they study it day and night.
019	PSA	001	003	They are like trees planted by runlets of water, yielding fruit in due season, leaves never fading. In all that they do, they prosper.
019	PSA	001	004	Not so fare the wicked, not so; like chaff are they, blown by the wind.
019	PSA	001	005	So the wicked will not stand firm in the judgment, nor sinners appear, when the righteous are gathered.
019	PSA	001	006	For the way of the righteous is dear to the Lord, but the way of the wicked will end in ruin.
019	PSA	002	001	Why this turmoil of nations, this futile plotting of peoples,
019	PSA	002	002	with kings of the earth conspiring, and rulers consulting together, against the Lord and against his anointed,
019	PSA	002	003	to snap their bonds and fling their cords away?
019	PSA	002	004	He whose throne is in heaven laughs, the Lord mocks them.
019	PSA	002	005	Then he speaks to them in his wrath, and in his hot anger confounds them.
019	PSA	002	006	‘This my king is installed by me, on Zion my holy mountain.’
019	PSA	002	007	I will tell of the Lord’s decree. He said to me: ‘You are my son, this day I became your father.
019	PSA	002	008	Only ask, and I make you the heir of the nations, and lord of the world to its utmost bounds.
019	PSA	002	009	You will break them with sceptre of iron, shatter them like pottery.’
019	PSA	002	010	So now, you kings, be wise: be warned, you rulers of earth.
019	PSA	002	011	Serve the Lord in awe, kiss his feet with trembling,
019	PSA	002	012	lest, angry, he hurl you to ruin; for soon will his fury blaze. Happy all who take refuge in him.
019	PSA	003	001	A psalm of David, when he fled from his son Absalom. How many, Lord, are my foes! Those who rise up against me are many.
019	PSA	003	002	Many are those who say of me, ‘There is no help for him in his God.’ (Selah)
019	PSA	003	003	But you, Lord, are shield about me, my glory, who lifts up my head.
019	PSA	003	004	When loudly I call to the Lord, from his holy hill he gives answer. (Selah)
019	PSA	003	005	I laid down and slept: now I wake, for the Lord sustains me.
019	PSA	003	006	I fear not the myriads of people who beset me on every side.
019	PSA	003	007	Arise, Lord: save me, my God, who strikes all my foes on the cheek, and shatters the teeth of the wicked.
019	PSA	003	008	Victory belongs to the Lord: let your blessing descend on your people. (Selah)
019	PSA	004	001	For the leader, with stringed instruments. A psalm of David. Answer my cry, God, my defender. Often from straits you have brought me to spacious places. So now show me your favour and hear my prayer.
019	PSA	004	002	How long, you proud people, will my honour be stained by the slanders you love, and the lies that you follow? (Selah)
019	PSA	004	003	See! The Lord has shown me his wonderful kindness: the Lord hears, when I call to him.
019	PSA	004	004	Sin not in your anger: but speak in your heart on your bed, and be still. (Selah)
019	PSA	004	005	Offer true sacrifice, trust in the Lord.
019	PSA	004	006	Many are longing for fortune to smile. Lift upon us the light of your face.
019	PSA	004	007	You have put in my heart, Lord, a deeper joy than was theirs who had corn and wine in abundance.
019	PSA	004	008	So in peace I will lie down and sleep; for you, Lord, keep me safe.
019	PSA	005	001	For the leader: A psalm of David, to be accompanied by the flute. Hear my words, Lord: give heed to my whisper.
019	PSA	005	002	Attend to my loud cry for help, my king and my God.
019	PSA	005	003	When I pray to you, Lord, in the morning, hear my voice. I make ready for you in the morning, and look for a sign.
019	PSA	005	004	For you are no God who takes pleasure in wickedness: no one of evil can be your guest.
019	PSA	005	005	No braggarts can stand in your presence, you hate all workers of wrong.
019	PSA	005	006	You destroy all speakers of lies, people of blood and deceit you abhor.
019	PSA	005	007	But I, through your kindness abundant, may enter your house, and towards the shrine of your temple may reverently bow.
019	PSA	005	008	Lead me, Lord, in your righteousness because of my enemies. Make your way level before me.
019	PSA	005	009	For their mouth is a stranger to truth, their heart is a pit of destruction. Their throat is a wide open grave, their tongue the smooth tongue of the hypocrite.
019	PSA	005	010	Condemn them, God; let their schemes bring them down to the ground. For their numberless crimes thrust them down for playing the rebel against you.
019	PSA	005	011	But let all who take refuge in you ring out their gladness forever. Protect those who love your name, so they may exult in you.
019	PSA	005	012	For you give your blessing, Lord, to the godly, and the shield of your favour protects them.
019	PSA	006	001	For the leader; with instrumental music on the sheminith. A psalm of David. Rebuke me not, Lord, in your anger, punish me not in your wrath.
019	PSA	006	002	Lord, be gracious to me in my weakness. Heal me Lord, for racked is my body;
019	PSA	006	003	all of me utterly racked. Why do you wait so long, Lord?
019	PSA	006	004	Turn, Lord, rescue me; save me, because of your love.
019	PSA	006	005	For in death none can call you to mind; in Sheol who can praise you?
019	PSA	006	006	I am so weary of sighing. All the night I make my bed swim, and wet my couch with my tears.
019	PSA	006	007	My eyes swollen with grief; from weeping caused by my foes.
019	PSA	006	008	Begone, workers of wrong, for the Lord has heard my loud weeping,
019	PSA	006	009	the Lord has heard my entreaty, the Lord accepts my prayer.
019	PSA	006	010	My foes will be stricken with terror, brought to shame and dismay in a moment.
019	PSA	007	001	A Shiggaion of David, which he sang to the Lord about Cush, the Benjamite. Lord my God, I take refuge in you. Deliver me, save me from all who pursue me;
019	PSA	007	002	or like lions they will tear me to pieces, and rend me, past hope of rescue.
019	PSA	007	003	Lord, my God, if my life has been such if my hands have been stained with guilt,
019	PSA	007	004	if friends I paid back with evil, if I plundered my foes without cause,
019	PSA	007	005	may the enemy chase and find me, trample my life to the ground, my honour leave in the dirt! (Selah)
019	PSA	007	006	Arise, Lord, in anger, against my foes rise in fury. Awake for my help: let justice be done.
019	PSA	007	007	Gather the nations about you, and sit on your lofty throne,
019	PSA	007	008	as the Lord, the judge of the peoples. Judge me, Lord, in my innocence and according to my integrity.
019	PSA	007	009	Put an end to the wrong of the wicked, protect the righteous. Searcher of hearts and minds, righteous God.
019	PSA	007	010	God is my shield: he saves the upright in heart.
019	PSA	007	011	God is a just judge, constant in righteous anger.
019	PSA	007	012	He will sharpen his sword without fail, his bow is bent and ready,
019	PSA	007	013	his deadly weapons are ready, his arrows he makes of flame.
019	PSA	007	014	The enemy who conceives evil; pregnant with mischief, giving birth to lies,
019	PSA	007	015	a pit they have made and dug; but into the hole that they made they will fall.
019	PSA	007	016	On their own heads their mischief comes back; on their own skulls their violence comes down.
019	PSA	007	017	I will give thanks to the Lord for his justice, and sing to the name of the Lord Most High.
019	PSA	008	001	For the leader: A psalm of David, to be accompanied by a stringed instrument. Lord our God! How glorious in all the earth is your name! Your praise reaches as high as the heavens,
019	PSA	008	002	from the mouths of children and infants. You have built a fortress against your enemies, to silence the foe and the rebel.
019	PSA	008	003	When I look at your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you have set there,
019	PSA	008	004	what are mortals, that you think of them, humans, that you visit them?
019	PSA	008	005	Yet you made them little less than divine, crowned them with glory and majesty,
019	PSA	008	006	made them lord of the works of your hands, put all things under their feet –
019	PSA	008	007	sheep and oxen, all of them; and the wild beasts also:
019	PSA	008	008	birds of the air, and fish of the sea, and all that crosses the paths of the ocean.
019	PSA	008	009	Lord our God! How glorious in all the earth is your name!
019	PSA	009	001	For the leader;’almuth labben. A psalm of David. With all my heart I will praise the Lord, all your wonders I will rehearse.
019	PSA	009	002	I will rejoice and exult in you, singing praise to your name, Most High;
019	PSA	009	003	because backward my foes were turned, they stumbled and perished before you.
019	PSA	009	004	My right and my claim you have upheld, you did sit on the throne as a fair judge,
019	PSA	009	005	rebuking the nations, destroying the wicked, and blotting their name out forever and ever.
019	PSA	009	006	The foe is vanished, ruined forever, their cities destroyed, their memory perished.
019	PSA	009	007	See! The Lord is seated forever on the throne he established for judgment,
019	PSA	009	008	ruling the world with justice, and judging the nations with equity.
019	PSA	009	009	So the Lord proves a haven to the oppressed, a haven in times of trouble.
019	PSA	009	010	Well may they trust you who know your name, for those who seek you, you never abandon.
019	PSA	009	011	Sing praise to the Lord, whose home is in Zion, declare his deeds among the nations.
019	PSA	009	012	As avenger of blood, he keeps them in mind, he does not forget the cry of the wretched.
019	PSA	009	013	Show me favour, Lord, see how my foes afflict me, lift me up from the gates of death;
019	PSA	009	014	so I may, in your help exulting, tell forth your praise at the gates of Zion.
019	PSA	009	015	The nations are sunk in the pit which they made, in the net that they hid, their own foot is entangled.
019	PSA	009	016	The Lord is revealed in the judgment he wrought, the wicked are snared in their own handiwork. (Selah)
019	PSA	009	017	Let the wicked depart to Sheol, all the nations that live forgetful of God.
019	PSA	009	018	For the needy will not be always forgotten, nor the hope of the helpless be lost forever.
019	PSA	009	019	Arise, Lord; don’t let them triumph: before your face let the nations be judged.
019	PSA	009	020	Strike them with fear, Lord: show the nations how frail they are. (Selah)
019	PSA	010	001	Why do you stand, Lord, so far away, hiding yourself in times of trouble?
019	PSA	010	002	The wicked, in their pride, are pursuing the helpless: let them be caught in the schemes they have plotted.
019	PSA	010	003	For the wicked boasts of their wanton greed; the robber despises the Lord, and curses him,
019	PSA	010	004	in wicked pride, thinks: God doesn’t care, God doesn’t call to account.
019	PSA	010	005	Never a season that they do not prosper; your judgments are far above out of their sight: they scoff at their foes.
019	PSA	010	006	Each says in their heart, ‘I will never be shaken; I will live for all time untouched by misfortune.’
019	PSA	010	007	Their mouths are full of deceit and oppression: under their tongues lurks mischief and wrong.
019	PSA	010	008	Lying in secret in some village ambush, and stealthily watching, they murder the innocent.
019	PSA	010	009	Like a lion that lurks in a secret lair they lurk intending to catch the defenceless; to seize them, to drag them away in their net.
019	PSA	010	010	Their victims are crushed, sink down to the ground. Under their claws the hapless fall.
019	PSA	010	011	The wicked say in their hearts that God has forgotten, has hidden his face, will see nothing.
019	PSA	010	012	Arise, Lord, lift up your hand, do not forget the cry of the wretched.
019	PSA	010	013	Why do the wicked treat God with contempt, and say in their hearts, ‘God doesn’t care’?
019	PSA	010	014	You have seen the trouble and sorrow; you mark it all, and will take it in hand. The hapless can count on you, helper of orphans.
019	PSA	010	015	Break the arm of the wicked and evil: search out their sin, till no more be found.
019	PSA	010	016	The Lord is king forever and ever: the nations will vanish from his land.
019	PSA	010	017	Lord, you have heard the desire of the humble, inclining your ear, strengthening their hearts,
019	PSA	010	018	rights you have won for the crushed and the orphan, so no one on earth may strike terror again.
019	PSA	011	001	For the leader. Of David. In the Lord I take refuge. How can you tell me to flee like a bird to the mountains?
019	PSA	011	002	‘See! The wicked are bending the bow, their arrow is set on the string, to shoot from the shadows at the upright in heart.
019	PSA	011	003	In this tearing down of foundations what good can a good person do?’
019	PSA	011	004	The Lord in his holy temple, the Lord in heaven, enthroned. His eyes watch the world, they see everyone.
019	PSA	011	005	The Lord examines the righteous and wicked, and the lover of violence he hates.
019	PSA	011	006	On the wicked he rains coals of fire and brimstone, and their drink will be scorching wind.
019	PSA	011	007	For the Lord is just, and justice he loves; so the upright will see his face.
019	PSA	012	001	For the leader; on the sheminith. A psalm of David. Help, Lord, for the good are all gone, faithful people have vanished.
019	PSA	012	002	One lies to another, speaking empty lies, with flattering lips and false hearts they speak.
019	PSA	012	003	May the Lord cut off all the flattering lips, and the tongue that utters arrogance,
019	PSA	012	004	they declare, ‘Our tongue is our strength, our allies our lips: who is lord over us?’
019	PSA	012	005	‘The poor are despoiled, and the needy are sighing; so now I will act,’ the Lord declares ‘And place them in the safety they long for.’
019	PSA	012	006	The words of the Lord are words that are pure, silver smelted, seven times refined.
019	PSA	012	007	You will keep us, Lord, and guard us from this generation forever,
019	PSA	012	008	in a world where the wicked prowl, and worthless people exalted.
019	PSA	013	001	For the leader. A psalm of David. How long, Lord, will you forget me forever? How long will you hide your face from me?
019	PSA	013	002	How long must I nurse grief inside me, and in my heart a daily sorrow? How long are my foes to exult over me?
019	PSA	013	003	Look at me, answer me, Lord my God. Fill my eyes with your light, lest I sleep in death,
019	PSA	013	004	lest my enemies claim to have triumphed, lest my foes rejoice at my downfall.
019	PSA	013	005	But I trust in your kindness: my heart will rejoice in your help.
019	PSA	013	006	I will sing to the Lord who was good to me.
019	PSA	014	001	For the leader. Of David. Fools say in their heart, ‘There is no God.’ Vile, hateful their life is; not one does good.
019	PSA	014	002	From heaven the Lord looks out on humans, to see if any are wise, and care for God.
019	PSA	014	003	But all have turned bad, the taint is on all; not one does good, no, not one.
019	PSA	014	004	Have they learned their lesson, those workers of evil? Who ate up my people, eating, devouring, never calling to the Lord.
019	PSA	014	005	Sore afraid will they be; for God is among those who are righteous,
019	PSA	014	006	you may mock the plans of the poor, but the Lord is their refuge.
019	PSA	014	007	If only help from Zion would come for Israel! When the Lord brings his people a change of fortune, how glad will be Jacob, and Israel how joyful!
019	PSA	015	001	A psalm of David. Lord, who can be guest in your tent? Who may live on your holy mountain?
019	PSA	015	002	The person whose walk is blameless, whose conduct is right, whose words are true and sincere;
019	PSA	015	003	on whose tongue there sits no slander, who will not harm a friend,
019	PSA	015	004	nor cruelly insult a neighbour, who regards with contempt those rejected by God; but honours those who obey the Lord, who keeps an oath, whatever the cost,
019	PSA	015	005	whose money is lent without interest, and never takes a bribe to hurt the innocent. The person who does these things will always stand firm.
019	PSA	016	001	A michtam of David. Keep me, O God, for in you I take refuge.
019	PSA	016	002	I said to the Lord, ‘You are my Lord, my happiness rests in you alone.
019	PSA	016	003	Those who are holy in the land, they, they alone, are the noble ones; all my delight is in them.’
019	PSA	016	004	Those who choose other gods find endless sorrow. In their offerings of blood I will have no part nor take their name on my lips.
019	PSA	016	005	The Lord is my share and my portion, my fate is in your strong hands.
019	PSA	016	006	The boundary lines of my life mark out delightful country, my heritage pleases me well.
019	PSA	016	007	I praise the Lord for his counsel, which so stirs my heart in the night.
019	PSA	016	008	I keep the Lord always in mind: with him at my hand, I can never be moved.
019	PSA	016	009	So my heart is glad, there is joy inside me; and in safety of body I live.
019	PSA	016	010	For you will not give me up to Sheol nor let any who love you see the pit.
019	PSA	016	011	You will show me the path that leads to life, to that fulness of joy which is in your presence, and the pleasures dispensed by your hand evermore.
019	PSA	017	001	A prayer of David. Listen, O Lord, to my innocence; attend to my piercing cry. Give heed to my prayer out of lips unfeigned.
019	PSA	017	002	Let my vindication come from you, your eyes see the truth.
019	PSA	017	003	When you test my heart when you visit at night, and assay me like silver – you can find no evil. I am determined that my mouth should not lie.
019	PSA	017	004	I gave earnest heed to the words of your lips.
019	PSA	017	005	My steps have held fast to the paths of your precepts and in your tracks have my feet never stumbled.
019	PSA	017	006	So I call you, O God, with assurance of answer; bend down your ear to me, hear what I say.
019	PSA	017	007	Show your marvellous love, you who save from enemies those who take refuge at your right hand.
019	PSA	017	008	Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me in the shelter of your wings.
019	PSA	017	009	From wicked people who do me violence, from deadly foes who crowd around me.
019	PSA	017	010	They have closed their hearts to pity, the words of their mouths are haughty.
019	PSA	017	011	Now they dog us at every step, keenly watching, to hurl us to the ground,
019	PSA	017	012	like a lion, longing to tear, like a young lion, lurking in secret.
019	PSA	017	013	Arise, Lord, face them and fell them. By your sword set me free from the wicked,
019	PSA	017	014	by your hand, O Lord, from those – whose portion of life is but of this world. But let your treasured ones have food in plenty may their children be full and their children satisfied.
019	PSA	017	015	In my innocence I will see your face, awake I am filled with a vision of you.
019	PSA	018	001	For the leader. Of David, the servant of the Lord, who recited the words of this song to the Lord after the Lord had saved him from the power of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul. He said: I love you, O Lord, my strength.
019	PSA	018	002	The Lord is my rock, my fortress, deliverer, my God, my rock, where I take refuge, my shield, my defender, my tower.
019	PSA	018	003	Worthy of praise is the Lord whom I call on, he rescues me from all my foes.
019	PSA	018	004	The waves of death broke about me, fearful floods of chaos.
019	PSA	018	005	Sheol threw cords around me, snares of death came to meet me.
019	PSA	018	006	In distress I cried to the Lord, and shouted for help to my God; in his temple he heard my voice, into his ears came my cry.
019	PSA	018	007	Then the earth shook and quaked, mountains trembled to their foundations, and quaked because of his wrath.
019	PSA	018	008	Smoke went up from his nostrils, devouring fire from his mouth, coals were kindled by it.
019	PSA	018	009	Then he bent the sky and came down, thick darkness was under his feet.
019	PSA	018	010	He rode on a cherub and flew, darting on wings of wind,
019	PSA	018	011	with his screen of darkness about him, in thick dark clouds of water.
019	PSA	018	012	At the radiance before him there passed hailstones and coals of fire.
019	PSA	018	013	The Lord thundered from heaven, the Most High uttered his voice.
019	PSA	018	014	He shot his arrows and scattered them, flashed lightnings, and routed them.
019	PSA	018	015	The channels of the sea were revealed, the world was laid bare to its base, at your rebuke, O Lord, at the blast of the breath of your nostrils.
019	PSA	018	016	He stretched from on high, he seized me, drew me up from the mighty waters,
019	PSA	018	017	and saved me from those who hated me – fierce foes, too mighty for me.
019	PSA	018	018	In my day of distress they assailed me, but the Lord proved my support.
019	PSA	018	019	To a spacious place he brought me, and, for love of me, he saved me.
019	PSA	018	020	The Lord repays my innocence, he rewards my cleanness of hands.
019	PSA	018	021	For I kept the ways of the Lord, nor have wickedly strayed from my God.
019	PSA	018	022	His commandments were all before me, his statutes I put not away.
019	PSA	018	023	And I was blameless before him, guarding myself from sin.
019	PSA	018	024	So the Lord repaid my innocence, my cleanness of hands in his sight.
019	PSA	018	025	With the loyal you are loyal, and with the blameless blameless.
019	PSA	018	026	With the pure you show yourself pure, but shrewd with the devious.
019	PSA	018	027	For the lowly people you save, but haughty eyes you abase.
019	PSA	018	028	You are my lamp, Lord, my God who enlightens my darkness.
019	PSA	018	029	With you I can storm a rampart, with my God I can leap a wall.
019	PSA	018	030	As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the Lord is pure. He is shield to all who take refuge in him.
019	PSA	018	031	For who is God but the Lord? And who is a rock but our God?
019	PSA	018	032	The God who arms me with strength, who cleared and smoothed my way.
019	PSA	018	033	He made my feet like hinds’ feet, and set me up on the heights.
019	PSA	018	034	He taught my hands how to fight, and my arms how to bend a bronze bow.
019	PSA	018	035	The shield of your help you gave me, your right hand supports me, you stoop down to make me great.
019	PSA	018	036	In your strength I took giant strides, and my feet never slipped.
019	PSA	018	037	So I chased the foe till I caught them, and turned not, till I made an end of them.
019	PSA	018	038	I smashed them, they could not rise, they fell beneath my feet.
019	PSA	018	039	You did arm me with strength for war, you did bow my assailants beneath me.
019	PSA	018	040	You made my foes turn their back to me, and those who did hate me I finished.
019	PSA	018	041	They cried for help, but none saved them; to the Lord, but he answered them not.
019	PSA	018	042	I beat them like dust of the market-place, stamped them like mud of the streets.
019	PSA	018	043	From the strife of the peoples you saved me, you made me head of the nations, peoples I knew not did serve me.
019	PSA	018	044	On the instant they hear, they obey me, foreigners come to me cringing.
019	PSA	018	045	Foreigners lose courage, and come out of their strongholds trembling.
019	PSA	018	046	The Lord is alive! Blest be my rock! Exalted be God, my protector!
019	PSA	018	047	The God who gave me revenge, and brought down nations beneath me,
019	PSA	018	048	who saved me from angry foes, and set me above my assailants, safe from the violent.
019	PSA	018	049	For this I will praise you among the nations, making music, O Lord, to your name:
019	PSA	018	050	for great triumphs he grants to his king, and faithful love he shows his anointed, to David and his seed evermore.
019	PSA	019	001	For the leader. A psalm of David. The heavens declare God’s glory, the sky tells what his hands have done.
019	PSA	019	002	Day tells it to day, night reveals it to night,
019	PSA	019	003	without speaking, without words; without the sound of voices.
019	PSA	019	004	But through all the world their voice carries their words to the ends of the earth. He has pitched a tent for the sun in the sky,
019	PSA	019	005	it comes out like a bridegroom from his bridal chamber, it joyfully runs its course like a hero.
019	PSA	019	006	From one end of the heavens it rises, and round it runs to the other, and nothing hides from its heat.
019	PSA	019	007	The law of the Lord is perfect, renewing life. The decrees of the Lord are trusty, making the simple wise.
019	PSA	019	008	The behests of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart. The command of the Lord is pure, giving light to the eyes.
019	PSA	019	009	The fear of the Lord is clean, it endures forever. The Lord’s judgments are true and right altogether.
019	PSA	019	010	More precious are they than gold – than fine gold in plenty, and sweeter they are than honey, that drops from the comb.
019	PSA	019	011	By them is your servant warned; who keeps them has rich reward.
019	PSA	019	012	Who can know their flaws? Absolve me from those I know not.
019	PSA	019	013	Keep your servant from wilful sins – from falling under their sway: then blameless and clear will I be from great offence.
019	PSA	019	014	May the words of my mouth and the thoughts of my heart be pleasing to you, Lord, my rock and redeemer.
019	PSA	020	001	For the leader. A psalm of David. The Lord answer you in the day of distress, the name of the Jacob’s God protect you,
019	PSA	020	002	sending you help from the temple, out of Zion supporting you.
019	PSA	020	003	All your meal-offerings may he remember, your burnt-offerings look on with favour. (Selah)
019	PSA	020	004	May he grant you your heart’s desire, and bring all your plans to pass.
019	PSA	020	005	We will shout then for joy at your victory, and rejoice in the name of our God. May the Lord grant your every request.
019	PSA	020	006	Now I am sure that the Lord will help his anointed. From his temple in heaven he will answer by his mighty triumphant right hand.
019	PSA	020	007	Some in chariots are strong, some in horses; but our strength is the Lord our God.
019	PSA	020	008	They will totter and fall, while we rise and stand firm.
019	PSA	020	009	Give victory, Lord, to the king, and answer us when we call.
019	PSA	021	001	For the leader. A psalm of David. The king rejoices, Lord, in your might, how he exults because of your help!
019	PSA	021	002	You have granted to him his heart’s desire, you have not withheld his lips’ request. (Selah)
019	PSA	021	003	You came to meet him with rich blessings, you set on his head a golden crown.
019	PSA	021	004	He asked you for life, you gave it – many long days, forever and ever.
019	PSA	021	005	Great is his glory because of your help, honour and majesty you lay upon him.
019	PSA	021	006	For you make him most blessed forever, you make him glad with the joy of your presence.
019	PSA	021	007	For the king puts always his trust in the Lord; the Most High, in his love, will preserve him unshaken.
019	PSA	021	008	Your hand will reach all your foes, your right hand, all who hate you.
019	PSA	021	009	You will make them like a furnace of fire, when you appear, Lord. The Lord will swallow them up in his wrath. The fire will devour them.
019	PSA	021	010	You will sweep their offspring from the earth, their children from humanity.
019	PSA	021	011	When they scheme against you and hatch evil plots – they will fail.
019	PSA	021	012	For you aim your bow at their faces, make them turn in flight.
019	PSA	021	013	Be exalted, Lord, in your strength, to your might we shall sing and make music.
019	PSA	022	001	For the leader; set to “Deer of the Dawn”. A psalm of David. My God, my God, why have you left me, my rescue so far from the words of my roaring?
019	PSA	022	002	I cry in the day, you do not answer, I cry in the night but find no rest.
019	PSA	022	003	You are the Holy One, throned on the praises of Israel.
019	PSA	022	004	In you our ancestors trusted, they trusted and you delivered them.
019	PSA	022	005	They cried to you, and found safety, in you did they trust and were not put to shame.
019	PSA	022	006	But I am a worm, not a person; insulted by others, despised by the people.
019	PSA	022	007	All who see me mock me, with mouths wide open and wagging heads:
019	PSA	022	008	‘He relies on the Lord; let him save him. Let him rescue the one he holds dear!’
019	PSA	022	009	But you drew me from the womb, laid me safely on my mother’s breasts.
019	PSA	022	010	On your care was I cast from my very birth, you are my God from my mother’s womb.
019	PSA	022	011	Be not far from me, for trouble is nigh, and there is none to help.
019	PSA	022	012	I am circled by many bulls, beset by the mighty of Bashan,
019	PSA	022	013	who face me with gaping jaws, like ravening roaring lions.
019	PSA	022	014	Poured out am I like water, and all my bones are loosened. My heart is become like wax, melted within me.
019	PSA	022	015	My palate is dry as a sherd, my tongue sticks to my jaws; in the dust of death you lay me.
019	PSA	022	016	For dogs are round about me, a band of knaves encircles me, gnawing my hands and my feet.
019	PSA	022	017	I can count my bones, every one. As for them, they feast their eyes on me.
019	PSA	022	018	They divide my garments among them, and over my raiment cast lots.
019	PSA	022	019	But you, O Lord, be not far, O my strength, hasten to help me.
019	PSA	022	020	Deliver my life from the sword my life from the power of the dogs.
019	PSA	022	021	Save me from the jaws of the lion, from the horns of the wild oxen help me.
019	PSA	022	022	I will tell of your fame to my kindred, and in the assembly will praise you.
019	PSA	022	023	Praise the Lord, you who fear him. All Jacob’s seed, give him glory. All Israel’s seed, stand in awe of him.
019	PSA	022	024	For he has not despised nor abhorred the sorrow of the sorrowful. He hid not his face from me, but he listened to my cry for help.
019	PSA	022	025	Of you is my praise in the great congregation; my vows I will pay before those who fear him.
019	PSA	022	026	The afflicted will eat to their heart’s desire, and those who seek after the Lord will praise him. Lift up your hearts forever.
019	PSA	022	027	All will call it to mind, to the ends of the earth, and turn to the Lord; and all tribes of the nations will bow down before you.
019	PSA	022	028	For the kingdom belongs to the Lord: he is the Lord of the nations.
019	PSA	022	029	To him will bow down all who sleep in the earth, and before him bend all who go down to the dust, and those who could not preserve their lives.

019	PSA	023	001	A psalm of David. The Lord is my shepherd: I am never in need.
019	PSA	023	002	He lays me down in green pastures. He gently leads me to waters of rest,
019	PSA	023	003	he refreshes my life. He guides me along paths that are straight, true to his name.
019	PSA	023	004	And when my way lies through a valley of gloom, I fear no evil, for you are with me. Your rod and your staff comfort me.
019	PSA	023	005	You spread a table for me in face of my foes; with oil you anoint my head, and my cup runs over.
019	PSA	023	006	Surely goodness and love will pursue me – all the days of my life. In the house of the Lord I will live through the length of the days.
019	PSA	024	001	Of David. A psalm. The earth is the Lord’s and all that it holds, the world and those who live in it.
019	PSA	024	002	For he founded it on the seas, and on the floods he sustains it.
019	PSA	024	003	Who may ascend the hill of the Lord? Who may stand in his holy place?
019	PSA	024	004	The clean of hands, the pure of heart, who sets not their heart upon sinful things, nor swears with intent to deceive:
019	PSA	024	005	they win from the Lord a blessing: God is their champion and saviour.
019	PSA	024	006	Such must be those who resort to him, and seek the face of the God of Jacob. (Selah)

019	PSA	025	002	In you I trust, put me not to shame; let not my foes exult over me.
019	PSA	025	003	None will be shamed who wait for you, but shame will fall upon wanton traitors.
019	PSA	025	004	Make me, O Lord, to know your ways: teach me your paths.
019	PSA	025	005	In your faithfulness guide me and teach me, for you are my God and my saviour.
019	PSA	025	006	Remember your pity, O Lord, and your kindness, for they have been ever of old.
019	PSA	025	007	Do not remember the sins of my youth; remember me in kindness, because of your goodness, Lord.
019	PSA	025	008	Good is the Lord and upright, so he teaches sinners the way.
019	PSA	025	009	The humble he guides in the right, he teaches the humble his way.
019	PSA	025	010	All his ways are loving and loyal to those who observe his charges and covenant.
019	PSA	025	011	Be true to your name Lord, forgive my many sins.
019	PSA	025	012	Who then is the person who fears the Lord? He will teach them the way to choose.
019	PSA	025	013	They will live in prosperity, their children will inherit the land.
019	PSA	025	014	The Lord gives guidance to those who fear him, and with his covenant he makes them acquainted.
019	PSA	025	015	My eyes are ever toward the Lord, for out of the net he brings my foot.
019	PSA	025	016	Turn to me with your favour, for I am lonely and crushed
019	PSA	025	017	In my heart are strain and storm; bring me out of my distresses.
019	PSA	025	018	Look on my misery and trouble, and pardon all my sins,
019	PSA	025	019	look on my foes oh, so many! And their cruel hatred towards me.
019	PSA	025	020	Deliver me, keep me, and shame not one who takes refuge in you.
019	PSA	025	021	May integrity and innocence preserve me, for I wait for you, O Lord.
019	PSA	025	022	Redeem Israel, O God, from all its distresses.
019	PSA	026	001	A psalm of David. Defend me, O Lord, for my walk has been blameless; in the Lord have I trusted unswervingly:
019	PSA	026	002	Examine me, Lord, and test me; test my heart and my mind.
019	PSA	026	003	For your love is before my eyes, and your faithfulness governs my way.
019	PSA	026	004	I never sat down with the worthless, nor companied with dissemblers.
019	PSA	026	005	I hate the assembly of knaves, I would never sit down with the wicked;
019	PSA	026	006	but, with hands washed in innocence, I would march round your altar, O Lord,
019	PSA	026	007	singing loud songs of thanks, and telling of all your wonders.
019	PSA	026	008	O Lord, I love your house, the place where your glory lives.
019	PSA	026	009	Do not gather me up with sinners; slay me not with people of blood,
019	PSA	026	010	whose hands are stained with villainy, and whose right hand is filled with bribes.
019	PSA	026	011	But my walk is blameless! O redeem me, be gracious to me.
019	PSA	026	012	My foot stands on even ground, in the choirs I will bless the Lord.
019	PSA	027	001	A psalm of David. The Lord is my light and my saviour; whom then should I fear? The Lord protects my life; whom then should I dread?
019	PSA	027	002	When the wicked drew near to assail me and eat up my flesh, it was those who distressed and opposed me who stumbled and fell.
019	PSA	027	003	Though against me a host should encamp, yet my heart would be fearless: though battle should rise up against me, still would I be trustful.
019	PSA	027	004	One thing have I asked of the Lord, and that do I long for – To live in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to gaze on the grace of the Lord and inquire in his temple.
019	PSA	027	005	For he will hide me in his shelter in the day of misfortune. In his sheltering tent he hides me: he lifts me up on a rock.
019	PSA	027	006	And now that my head he has lifted above my encircling foes, I will march round the altar and sacrifice, shouting with joy, in his tent, making music and song to the Lord.
019	PSA	027	007	Hear, O Lord, my loud cry, and graciously answer me.
019	PSA	027	008	My heart has said to you, ‘Your face, O Lord, I seek.’
019	PSA	027	009	Hide not your face from me, reject not your servant in anger: for you have been my help. Abandon me not, nor forsake me, O God of my help:
019	PSA	027	010	for father and mother have left me; but the Lord will take me up.
019	PSA	027	011	Teach me your way, O Lord: lead me in an even path, because of my enemies.
019	PSA	027	012	Give me not up, O Lord, unto the rage of my foes; for against me have risen false witnesses, breathing out cruelty.
019	PSA	027	013	Firm is the faith I cherish, that I, in the land of the living, will yet see the goodness of God.
019	PSA	027	014	Let your heart be courageous and strong, and wait on the Lord.
019	PSA	028	001	Of David. Unto you, O Lord, do I cry; my rock, be not deaf to me: lest, through holding your peace, I become like those who go down to the pit.
019	PSA	028	002	Hear my loud entreaty, as I cry for help to you, lifting my hands, O Lord, towards your holy chancel.
019	PSA	028	003	Take me not off with the wicked, nor with the workers of wrong, whose speech to their neighbours is friendly, while evil is in their heart.
019	PSA	028	004	Give them as they have done, as their wicked deeds deserve. As their hands have wrought, so give to them: requite to them their deserts.
019	PSA	028	005	They are blind to all that the Lord does, to all that his hands have wrought; and so he will tear them down, to build them up no more.
019	PSA	028	006	Blest be the Lord, who has heard my voice as I plead for mercy.
019	PSA	028	007	The Lord is my strength and my shield; my heart trusts in him. I was helped: so my heart is exultant, and in my song I will praise him.
019	PSA	028	008	The Lord is the strength of his people, the fortress who saves his anointed.
019	PSA	028	009	O save your people, and bless your inheritance. Be their shepherd and carry them forever.
019	PSA	029	001	A psalm of David. Ascribe to the Lord, you heavenly beings, ascribe to the Lord glory and power
019	PSA	029	002	Ascribe to the Lord the glory he manifests: bow to the Lord in holy array.
019	PSA	029	003	The Lord’s voice peals on the waters. The God of glory has thundered. He peals o’er the mighty waters.
019	PSA	029	004	The Lord’s voice sounds with strength, the Lord’s voice sounds with majesty.
019	PSA	029	005	The Lord’s voice breaks the cedars, he breaks the cedars of Lebanon,
019	PSA	029	006	making Lebanon dance like a calf, Sirion like a young wild ox.
019	PSA	029	007	The Lord’s voice hews out flames of fire.
019	PSA	029	008	The Lord’s voice rends the desert, he rends the desert of Kadesh.
019	PSA	029	009	The Lord’s voice whirls the oaks, and strips the forests bare; and all in his temple say ‘Glory.’
019	PSA	029	010	The Lord was king at the flood, the Lord sits throned forever.
019	PSA	029	011	The Lord gives strength to his people, he blesses his people with peace.
019	PSA	030	001	A psalm of David. A song for the dedication of the Temple. I will extol you, O Lord, because you have lifted me up, and not suffered my foes to rejoice over me.
019	PSA	030	002	I cried to you for help, O Lord my God, and you healed me.
019	PSA	030	003	You have brought me up, Lord, from Sheol, from my way to the pit back to life you have called me.
019	PSA	030	004	Sing praise to the Lord, faithful people; give thanks to his holy name.
019	PSA	030	005	For his anger lasts only a moment, his favour endures for a lifetime. Weeping may lodge for the night, but the morning brings shouts of joy.
019	PSA	030	006	When all went well, I imagined that never should I be shaken.
019	PSA	030	007	For by your favour, O Lord, you had set me on mountains strong: but you hide your face, and I was confounded.
019	PSA	030	008	Then to you, Lord, I cried, to the Lord I begged for mercy,
019	PSA	030	009	‘What profit is there in my blood, if I go down to the pit? Can you be praised by dust? Can it tell of your faithfulness?
019	PSA	030	010	Hear, Lord, and show me your favour, Lord be a helper to me.’
019	PSA	030	011	You have turned my mourning to dancing; my sackcloth you have unloosed, and clothed me with joy:
019	PSA	030	012	that unceasingly I should sing your praise, and give thanks to you, Lord my God, forever.
019	PSA	031	001	For the leader. A psalm of David. In you, O Lord, I take refuge; let me never be put to shame. Rescue me in your faithfulness;
019	PSA	031	002	incline to me your ear. Deliver me speedily. Be to me a rock of defence, a fortified house, to save me.
019	PSA	031	003	For my rock and my fortress are you; lead me and guide me so your name will be honoured.
019	PSA	031	004	Draw me out of the net they have hid for me, for you yourself are my refuge.
019	PSA	031	005	Into your hand I commend my spirit: you ransom me, Lord, faithful God.
019	PSA	031	006	I hate those devoted to worthless idols; I trust in the Lord.
019	PSA	031	007	I will rejoice and be glad in your love, because you have looked on my misery, and cared for me in my distress.
019	PSA	031	008	You have not given me into the enemy’s hand, you have set my feet in a spacious place.
019	PSA	031	009	Be gracious to me, Lord, for I am distressed; my eye is wasted away with sorrow.
019	PSA	031	010	For my life is consumed with grief, and my years with sighing. My strength is broken with misery, my bones waste away.
019	PSA	031	011	The scorn of all my foes, the butt of my neighbours am I, a terror to my acquaintance. At the sight of me in the street people turn quickly away.
019	PSA	031	012	I am clean forgotten like the dead, am become like a ruined vessel.
019	PSA	031	013	I hear the whispers of many – terror on every side – scheming together against me, plotting to take my life.
019	PSA	031	014	But my trust is in you, Lord. ‘You are my God,’ I say;
019	PSA	031	015	my times are in your hand, save me from the hand of the foes who pursue me.
019	PSA	031	016	Make your face to shine on your servant, save me in your love.
019	PSA	031	017	Put me not, O Lord, to shame, for I have called upon you. Let the wicked be put to shame silent in Sheol.
019	PSA	031	018	Strike the false lips dumb, that speak proudly against the righteous with haughtiness and contempt.
019	PSA	031	019	How great is the goodness you have treasured for those who fear you, and wrought for those who take refuge in you, in plain sight of all!
019	PSA	031	020	In your sheltering wings you hide them from plottings of people, you keep them safe in a bower from the chiding of tongues.
019	PSA	031	021	Blest be the Lord for the wonderful love he has shown me in time of distress.
019	PSA	031	022	For I had said in panic, ‘I am driven clean out of your sight.’ But you heard my plea, when I cried to you for help.
019	PSA	031	023	Love the Lord, all you faithful; the Lord protects the loyal, but repays the haughty in full.
019	PSA	031	024	Let your hearts be courageous and strong, all you who wait on the Lord.
019	PSA	032	001	Of David. A maskil. Happy those whose transgression is pardoned, whose sin is covered.
019	PSA	032	002	Happy are those, free from falseness of spirit, to whom the Lord reckons no debt of guilt.
019	PSA	032	003	When I held my peace, my bones wore away with my endless groaning;
019	PSA	032	004	for day and night did your hand lie heavy upon me. The sap of my life was dried up as with fierce summer-heat. (Selah)
019	PSA	032	005	I began to acknowledge my sin, not concealing my guilt; and the moment I vowed to confess to the Lord my transgression, then you yourself did pardon the guilt of my sin. (Selah)
019	PSA	032	006	For this cause let all who are faithful pray to you in the time of distress; then, when the great waters rush, they will not reach to him.
019	PSA	032	007	For you are my shelter, you protect me from trouble, and surround me with deliverance. (Selah)
019	PSA	032	008	‘With my eye steadfastly upon you, I will instruct and teach you The way you should go.
019	PSA	032	009	Do not be like the horse or the mule, that have no understanding, but need bridle and halter to curb them, else they will not come near to you.’
019	PSA	032	010	The godless have many sorrows, but those who trust in the Lord will be compassed about by his kindness.
019	PSA	032	011	Be glad in the Lord, and rejoice, you righteous; and ring out your joy, all you upright in heart.
019	PSA	033	001	Shout for joy in the Lord, you righteous: praise for the upright is seemly.
019	PSA	033	002	Give thanks to the Lord on the lyre, play to him on a ten-stringed harp.
019	PSA	033	003	Sing to him a new song, play skilfully and shout merrily.
019	PSA	033	004	For the Lord is straight in his promise; and all that he does is in faithfulness.
019	PSA	033	005	Justice and right he loves; the earth is full of his kindness.
019	PSA	033	006	By his word the heavens were made, all their host by the breath of his mouth.
019	PSA	033	007	He gathers the sea in a bottle, the ocean he puts into store-houses.
019	PSA	033	008	Let the whole world honour the Lord, let all who live on earth be in awe.
019	PSA	033	009	For at his word it came into being, at his command it stood forth.
019	PSA	033	010	The Lord frustrates the designs of the nations, what the peoples have purposed, he brings to nought,
019	PSA	033	011	but the Lord’s own design will stand forever, and what his heart has purposed, through all generations.
019	PSA	033	012	Happy the nation whose God is the Lord, the people he chose for himself as his own.
019	PSA	033	013	The Lord looks down from heaven, he sees all of humanity;
019	PSA	033	014	from where he rules he gazes on all who inhabit the earth.
019	PSA	033	015	He fashions the hearts of them all, and gives heed to all that they do.
019	PSA	033	016	It is not by great armies that kings are victorious, it is not by great strength that a warrior saves himself;
019	PSA	033	017	false hope is the war-horse to usher in victory, for all its great might it can provide no escape.
019	PSA	033	018	See! The eye of the Lord is on those who fear him, on those who hope in his kindness;
019	PSA	033	019	to deliver their life from death, and to keep them alive in famine.
019	PSA	033	020	We wait for the Lord: he is our help and our shield.
019	PSA	033	021	For in him our heart is glad, we trust in his holy name.
019	PSA	033	022	Let your kindness, O Lord, be upon us, as is our hope in you.
019	PSA	034	001	Of David, when he feigned madness in the presence of Abimelech, who drove him away, and he left. I will bless the Lord at all times, in my mouth will his praise be forever.
019	PSA	034	002	In the Lord will my heart make her boast, the humble will hear and be glad.
019	PSA	034	003	O magnify the Lord with me and let us extol his name together.
019	PSA	034	004	I sought the Lord, and, in answer, he saved me from all my terrors.
019	PSA	034	005	Look to him and you will be radiant, with faces unashamed.
019	PSA	034	006	Here is one who was crushed, but cried and was heard by the Lord, and brought safe out of every trouble.
019	PSA	034	007	The Lord’s angel encamps about those who fear him, and rescues them.
019	PSA	034	008	O taste and see that the Lord is good, happy those who take refuge in him.
019	PSA	034	009	Fear the Lord, all his people, for they who fear him lack nothing.
019	PSA	034	010	Even young lions may be poor and hungry, but those who seek the Lord will not lack any good thing.
019	PSA	034	011	Come, children, listen to me. I will teach you the fear of the Lord.
019	PSA	034	012	Which of you is desirous of life, loves many and happy days?
019	PSA	034	013	Then guard your tongue from evil, and your lips from speaking deceit.
019	PSA	034	014	Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.
019	PSA	034	015	The eyes of the Lord are towards the righteous, his ears are towards their cry for help.
019	PSA	034	016	The Lord sets his face against those who do evil, to root their memory out of the earth.
019	PSA	034	017	When righteous cry, they are heard by the Lord, and he saves them from all their distresses.
019	PSA	034	018	The Lord is near to the broken-hearted, he helps those whose spirit is crushed.
019	PSA	034	019	Many misfortunes befall the righteous, but the Lord delivers them out of them all.
019	PSA	034	020	He guards all their bones, none are broken.
019	PSA	034	021	Misfortune will slay the ungodly; those who hate the righteous are doomed.
019	PSA	034	022	The Lord ransoms the life of his servants, and none will be doomed who takes refuge in him.
019	PSA	035	001	Of David. Contend, Lord, with those who contend with me, do battle with those who do battle with me.
019	PSA	035	002	Grasp shield and buckler, and rise up as my help.
019	PSA	035	003	Draw spear and battle-axe, confront those who pursue me. Assure me that you will help me.
019	PSA	035	004	Dishonour and shame be on those who are seeking my life! Defeat and confusion on those who are planning my hurt!
019	PSA	035	005	As chaff before wind may they be, with the Lord’s angel pursuing them.
019	PSA	035	006	Slippery and dark be their way, with his angel thrusting them on.
019	PSA	035	007	For they wantonly hid their net for me, and dug a pit to destroy me.
019	PSA	035	008	Upon them may ruin come unawares; may the net which they hid catch themselves, and into the pit may they fall.
019	PSA	035	009	Then I will exult in the Lord, and be joyful because of his help;
019	PSA	035	010	and all my being will say, ‘Who, O Lord, is like you, who save the helpless from those too strong for them, the poor and the helpless from those who despoil them?’
019	PSA	035	011	Violent witnesses rise, and ask of me things that I know not.
019	PSA	035	012	Evil for good they requite me, leaving me inwardly comfortless.
019	PSA	035	013	But when they were sick, I put on sackcloth, and chastened myself with fasting. I prayed with head bowed low,
019	PSA	035	014	as if for my friend or my brother. I went about bowed and in mourning, as one who laments his mother.
019	PSA	035	015	When I stumbled, they gleefully gathered, strangers gathered around me, and tore at me without ceasing,
019	PSA	035	016	impiously mocking and mocking, bearing their teeth at me.
019	PSA	035	017	How long, Lord, will you look on? Rescue me from their roaring, my precious life from the lions.
019	PSA	035	018	I will then give you thanks in the great congregation, and praise you before many people.
019	PSA	035	019	Suffer not those to rejoice over me who are falsely my foes, suffer not those who without cause abhor me to wink with the eye.
019	PSA	035	020	For it is not peace that they speak of those who are quiet in the land; but treacherous charges they plot.
019	PSA	035	021	With wide open mouths they shout, ‘Hurrah! Hurrah! With our own eyes we saw it.’
019	PSA	035	022	But you have seen, too, O Lord, keep not silence, O Lord, be not far from me.
019	PSA	035	023	Bestir you, awake, for my right my God, my Lord, for my cause.
019	PSA	035	024	You are just, Lord: win for me justice, let them not rejoice over me,
019	PSA	035	025	inwardly saying, ‘Hurrah! The desire of our hearts at last! Now we have swallowed him up.’
019	PSA	035	026	Shame and confusion together on those who rejoice at my hurt! Clothed with shame and dishonour be those who are haughty to me!
019	PSA	035	027	Let such as delight in my cause ring out their gladness, and say evermore, ‘Great is the Lord whose delight is the well-being of his servant.’
019	PSA	035	028	Then my tongue will tell of your justice, and all the day long of your praise.
019	PSA	036	001	For the leader. Of the servant of the Lord, of David. Sin whispers within the heart of the wicked, who have no dread of God before their eyes.
019	PSA	036	002	It flatters them in their eyes that their sin will not be found out.
019	PSA	036	003	First, their speech becomes wicked and false, they give up acting wisely and well.
019	PSA	036	004	Then they plot deliberate wrong, take their stand on the wicked way, without the least shrinking from evil.
019	PSA	036	005	Your love, O Lord, touches the heavens, your faithfulness reaches the clouds.
019	PSA	036	006	Your justice is like the great mountains, your judgments are like the broad sea. Lord, you save people and animals.
019	PSA	036	007	How precious your love, O God! All may seek shelter in the shadow of your wings.
019	PSA	036	008	They feast on the fat of your house, they drink of your brook of delights.
019	PSA	036	009	For with you is the fountain of life, in the light that is yours we see light.
019	PSA	036	010	O continue your grace to the faithful, your love to the upright in heart.
019	PSA	036	011	Let no arrogant foot tread upon me, no wicked hand drive me to exile.
019	PSA	036	012	There the workers of wrong lie prostrate, thrust down to rise up no more.
019	PSA	037	001	Of David. Be not kindled to wrath at the wicked, nor envious of those who work wrong;
019	PSA	037	002	for, like grass, they will speedily wither, and fade like the green of young grass.
019	PSA	037	003	Trust in the Lord, and do good; remain in the land, and deal faithfully:
019	PSA	037	004	then the Lord will be your delight, he will grant you your heart’s petitions.
019	PSA	037	005	Commit your way to the Lord; trust in him, and he will act,
019	PSA	037	006	making clear as the light your right, and your just cause clear as the noon-day.
019	PSA	037	007	In silence and patience wait on the Lord. Be not kindled to anger at those who prosper. At those who execute evil devices.
019	PSA	037	008	Desist from anger, abandon wrath: be not kindled to anger it leads but to evil:
019	PSA	037	009	for evildoers will be cut off, but the land will be theirs, who wait on the Lord.
019	PSA	037	010	Yet but a little, and the wicked vanish: look at their place: they are there no more.
019	PSA	037	011	But the humble will have the land, and the rapture of peace in abundance.
019	PSA	037	012	The wicked plots against the righteous, snarls like a wild animal;
019	PSA	037	013	the Lord laughs, for he sees that his day is coming.
019	PSA	037	014	The wicked have drawn the sword, and bent the bow, to fell the poor, to slay those who walk uprightly;
019	PSA	037	015	but their sword will pierce their own heart, and their bows will be broken in pieces.
019	PSA	037	016	Better is the righteous person’s little than the wealth of many wicked.
019	PSA	037	017	For the arms of the wicked will be broken, but the Lord upholds the righteous.
019	PSA	037	018	The Lord watches over the days of the blameless, their heritage will continue forever.
019	PSA	037	019	They will not be shamed in the evil time, in the days of famine they will be satisfied.
019	PSA	037	020	Because the wicked will perish: but the foes of the Lord, like a brand in the oven, will vanish, like smoke they will vanish.
019	PSA	037	021	The wicked must borrow and cannot pay back, but the righteous is lavish and gives.
019	PSA	037	022	For those blest by the Lord inherit the land, while those whom he curses will be cut off.
019	PSA	037	023	The Lord supports the steps of those with whom he is pleased.
019	PSA	037	024	Though they fall, they will not be cast headlong, for the Lord holds their hands.
019	PSA	037	025	Never, from youth to age, have I seen the righteous forsaken, or their children begging bread.
019	PSA	037	026	They are ever lavishly lending, and their children are fountains of blessing.
019	PSA	037	027	Turn away from evil and do good and you will live in the land forever.
019	PSA	037	028	For the Lord loves justice, he does not forsake his friends. The unrighteous will be destroyed forever, and the seed of the wicked will be cut off.
019	PSA	037	029	But the land will belong to the righteous, they will live upon it forever,
019	PSA	037	030	The mouth of the righteous murmurs wisdom, and words of justice are on their tongues.
019	PSA	037	031	The law of their God is in their heart, their steps are never unsteady.
019	PSA	037	032	The wicked watches the righteous, and seeks to put them to death.
019	PSA	037	033	But the Lord leaves them not in their hand: at their trial they will not be held guilty.
019	PSA	037	034	Wait on the Lord, and observe his way: he will lift you to honour the land will be yours, you will feast your eyes on the doom of the wicked.
019	PSA	037	035	I have seen the wicked exultant, lifting themselves like a cedar of Lebanon.
019	PSA	037	036	But the moment I passed, they vanished! I sought for them, but they could not be found.
019	PSA	037	037	Preserve your honour and practise uprightness, for such a person fares well in the end.
019	PSA	037	038	But transgressors will perish together. Cut off are the wicked forever.
019	PSA	037	039	The righteous are saved by the Lord, who in time of distress is their refuge:
019	PSA	037	040	the Lord helps and rescue them, from the wicked he rescues and saves them, because they take refuge in him.
019	PSA	038	001	A Psalm of David. A lament. Reprove me not, Lord, in your anger, and chasten me not in your wrath;
019	PSA	038	002	for your arrows have sunk into me, and your hand lies heavy upon me.
019	PSA	038	003	In my flesh is no soundness because of your anger, no health in my bones, because of my sin.
019	PSA	038	004	For that my guilt is gone over my head: it weighs like a burden too heavy for me.
019	PSA	038	005	My wounds stink and fester, for my foolishness I am tormented.
019	PSA	038	006	Bent and bowed am I utterly, all the day going in mourning.
019	PSA	038	007	My loins are filled with burning, and in my flesh is no soundness.
019	PSA	038	008	I am utterly crushed and numb; I cry louder than lion roars.
019	PSA	038	009	Lord, you know all that I long for, my groans are not hidden from you.
019	PSA	038	010	My heart is throbbing, my strength has failed me. The light of my eyes – even it is gone from me.
019	PSA	038	011	My dear ones and friends keep aloof, and my neighbours stand afar off.
019	PSA	038	012	They who aim at my life lay their snares, they who seek my hurt speak of ruin, nursing treachery all the day long.
019	PSA	038	013	But I turn a deaf ear and hear not; like the dumb I open not my mouth.
019	PSA	038	014	I am like one without hearing, with no arguments in my mouth.
019	PSA	038	015	For my hope, O Lord, is in you. You will answer, O Lord my God,
019	PSA	038	016	when I utter the hope that those who made scorn of my tottering feet may not rejoice over me.
019	PSA	038	017	For I am ready to fall, my pain forsakes me never.
019	PSA	038	018	I acknowledge my guilt, I am anxious because of my sin:
019	PSA	038	019	My wanton assailants are strong, those who wrongfully hate me are many,
019	PSA	038	020	who render me evil for good, and oppose me, because I make good my goal.
019	PSA	038	021	Do not forsake me, O Lord; my God, be not far from me.
019	PSA	038	022	Hasten to help me, O Lord my saviour.
019	PSA	039	001	For the leader; for Jeduthun. A psalm of David. I vowed to watch my words, and sin not with my tongue, but to put on my mouth a muzzle, while the wicked were in my presence.
019	PSA	039	002	I was silent and dumb, speechless: but my pain was stirred up.
019	PSA	039	003	My heart grew hot within me; as I mused, the fire was kindled, till at last the words came to my tongue.
019	PSA	039	004	‘Teach me, O Lord, my end, and the sum of my days what it is. Let me know how transient I am.
019	PSA	039	005	See! My days you have made but a span, and my life is as nothing before you. It is but as a breath that everyone stands: (Selah)
019	PSA	039	006	it is but in mere semblance we walk to and fro, and all our noise is for nothing. We heap up, and know not who will gather.’
019	PSA	039	007	And now, what wait I for, Lord? My hope is in you.
019	PSA	039	008	From all my transgressions deliver me; make me not the scorn of the fool.
019	PSA	039	009	I am dumb, never opening my mouth, for this is your own doing.
019	PSA	039	010	Remove your stroke from off me: by the might of your hand I am spent.
019	PSA	039	011	When you rebuke someone to punish their sins, you consume, like a moth, what they treasures. Everyone is only a breath. (Selah)
019	PSA	039	012	Hear my prayer, O Lord; attend to my cry for help. Hold not your peace at my tears. For I am but a guest of yours, a stranger visiting, like all my ancestors.
019	PSA	039	013	Look away from me, let me smile again, before I die and am gone.
019	PSA	040	001	For the leader. A psalm of David. For the Lord I waited and waited, till, inclining to me, he heard my cry.
019	PSA	040	002	From the horrible pit he drew me, up out of the miry clay; he set my feet on a rock, and my steps he made firm.
019	PSA	040	003	He put a new song in my mouth, of praise to our God. Many see it, and, filled with awe, put their trust in the Lord.
019	PSA	040	004	Happy the person who has put in the Lord their trust, not looking to false gods or turning to idols.
019	PSA	040	005	With us you have wrought in rich measure, O Lord our God, your marvels and purposes for us – none may compare with you – were I to declare or to tell them, past counting are they.
019	PSA	040	006	In offerings bloody or bloodless you have no delight, but with open ears you have made me. Burnt-offering and offering for sin are not what you ask.
019	PSA	040	007	Then said I, ‘Here I am, as the roll of the book has enjoined.
019	PSA	040	008	My delight, O God, is to do your will, and your law is within my heart.’
019	PSA	040	009	Well, O Lord, you know that, with lips unrestrained, your righteousness I told in the great congregation,
019	PSA	040	010	not hiding it in my heart. I have told of your steadfast help, from the great congregation I hid not your love and your faithfulness.
019	PSA	040	011	So do not restrain, Lord, your pity from us. Your love and your faithfulness – ever may they be our shield.
019	PSA	040	012	For evils that cannot be numbered have compassed me round. My transgressions have followed me up – I can bear it no more. They are more than the hairs of my head, and my heart has forsaken me.
019	PSA	040	013	O Lord, be pleased to deliver me, haste to my help, O Lord.
019	PSA	040	014	May those who are seeking my life be ashamed and confounded together; may those who delight in my hurt be defeated and brought to dishonour.
019	PSA	040	015	May those who hurrah over me be dumbfounded because of their shame.
019	PSA	040	016	But may all who seek after you rejoice and be glad in you. May all those eager for your aid, say, ‘Great is the Lord’ evermore.
019	PSA	040	017	I am weak and needy, yet the Lord cares for me. You are my help and deliverer; don’t delay, my God.
019	PSA	041	001	For the leader; for Jeduthun. A psalm of David. Happy are those who consider the weak; in the day of misfortune the Lord will deliver them.
019	PSA	041	002	He will keep them safe, happy, and long in the land, and not give them up to the rage of their foes.
019	PSA	041	003	The Lord will sustain them on bed of languishing; tending their sickness, as long as they lie.
019	PSA	041	004	For this cause I say, ‘Lord, show me your favour; heal me, because I have sinned against you.’
019	PSA	041	005	My enemies speak of me nothing but evil, ‘When will he die, and his name pass away?’
019	PSA	041	006	When one comes to see me, their words ring hollow; their heart keeps gathering mischief the while; and when they go out, they give it speech.
019	PSA	041	007	In secret they whisper together against me, all those who hate me plot evil against me.
019	PSA	041	008	‘Some fatal disease has fastened upon him; and now that he lies, he will rise up no more.’
019	PSA	041	009	My most trusted friend, on whom I relied, who ate of my bread, has turned against me.
019	PSA	041	010	But do you, Lord, graciously raise me up, that I may pay them their due reward.
019	PSA	041	011	By this will I know you delight in me: if my foes may not shout over me in triumph.
019	PSA	041	012	For my innocence you uphold me, and set me forever before your face.
019	PSA	041	013	Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting, Amen and Amen.
019	PSA	042	001	For the leader. A maskil of the Korahites. Like the hart which longs for brooks of water, I long for you, God.
019	PSA	042	002	I thirst for God, for my living God. When shall I enter in, and see the face of God?
019	PSA	042	003	My tears have been my food by day and by night; for they say to me all the day long, ‘Where is your God?’
019	PSA	042	004	My heart floods with sorrow, as I call to mind: how I used to pass on with the throng, at their head, to the house of God, with glad shouts and giving of thanks, in the throng who kept festival.
019	PSA	042	005	Why am I downcast? Why this moaning within me? Hope in God; for yet will I praise him, my help, my God.
019	PSA	042	006	I am sunk in my misery; I will therefore call you to mind from the land of Jordan and Hermon, the mountain Mizar.
019	PSA	042	007	Flood is calling to flood at the noise of your cataracts; all your waves and your breakers have passed over me.
019	PSA	042	008	In the day I cry to the Lord to summon his kindness; and the song that I sing in the night is a prayer to the living God.
019	PSA	042	009	I say to God my rock, ‘Why have you forgotten me? Why must I walk so sadly, so hard pressed by the foe?’
019	PSA	042	010	It pierces me to the heart to hear the enemy’s taunts, as all the day long they say to me, ‘Where is your God?’
019	PSA	042	011	Why am I downcast? Why this moaning within me? Hope in God; for yet will I praise him, my help, my God.
019	PSA	043	001	Right me, defend my cause against a pitiless people. From the crafty and crooked, O God, deliver me.
019	PSA	043	002	For you are God my protector: why have you cast me off? Why must I walk so sadly, so hard pressed by the foe?
019	PSA	043	003	Send forth your light and your truth, let them be my guides: to your holy hill let them bring me, to the place where you live.
019	PSA	043	004	Then will I go to God’s altar, to God my rejoicing; and with joy on the lyre I will praise you, O God, my God.
019	PSA	043	005	Why am I downcast? Why this moaning within me? Hope in God; for yet will I praise him, my help, my God.
019	PSA	044	001	For the leader. Of the Korahites. A maskil. O God, we have heard with our ears, all our ancestors have told us of the work that you wrought in their day, your wonders in days of old,
019	PSA	044	002	uprooting and crushing the nations, then planting and settling them. For it wasn’t their own sword that won them the land,
019	PSA	044	003	it was not their own arm that brought them the victory. Yours was the hand and the arm, yours was the face that shone on them with favour.
019	PSA	044	004	It was you, my king and my God, that ordained the victories of Jacob.
019	PSA	044	005	Through you we can thrust back our foes, and by your name tread down our assailants:
019	PSA	044	006	for not in my bow do I trust, nor can my sword win me the victory.
019	PSA	044	007	Our victory comes from you, and confusion to those who hate us.
019	PSA	044	008	In God we boast all the day long, and your name will we praise forever. (Selah)
019	PSA	044	009	Yet you have spurned and disgraced us, in not going forth with our armies,
019	PSA	044	010	and in making us flee from the foe, so that those who hated us plundered us.
019	PSA	044	011	You have let us be eaten like sheep, you have scattered us over the world,
019	PSA	044	012	sold your people for a pittance, and getting no gain from their price.
019	PSA	044	013	You have made us the butt of our neighbours, the derision and scorn of all round us.
019	PSA	044	014	O’er the world you have made us a byword, the nations at us shake their heads.
019	PSA	044	015	My disgrace is forever before me, my face is covered with shame,
019	PSA	044	016	at the words of blasphemer and scoffer, at the sight of the foe and the vengeful.
019	PSA	044	017	All this has come upon us, yet we have not forgotten you nor falsely dealt with your covenant.
019	PSA	044	018	Our heart has not turned back, nor our steps declined from your way,
019	PSA	044	019	that you thus should have crushed us down, and covered us over with gloom, in the place where the jackals roam.
019	PSA	044	020	Had we forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our hands to a god that was strange,
019	PSA	044	021	would God not have searched this out? For he knows the heart and its secrets.
019	PSA	044	022	But in your cause it is we are killed all the day, and counted as sheep for the slaughter.
019	PSA	044	023	Rouse yourself, why do you sleep Lord? Awake, cast us not off forever.
019	PSA	044	024	Why do you hide your face, forgetting our stress and our misery?
019	PSA	044	025	For we have sunk down to the dust, our bodies cling to the ground.
019	PSA	044	026	Arise, come to our help: for your love’s sake, ransom us.
019	PSA	045	001	For the leader; on shoshannim. Of the Korahites. A maskil. A love song. My heart is astir with beautiful words: I will sing a song, concerning the king, with tongue like the pen of a ready writer.
019	PSA	045	002	Your beauty is more than mortal, grace is shed over your lips: therefore God has blessed you forever.
019	PSA	045	003	Warrior, strap your sword on your thigh. What glory and splendour!
019	PSA	045	004	Good fortune attend you, as forth you ride in the cause of good faith, and as champion of justice. May your arm instruct you in deeds of dread.
019	PSA	045	005	Sharp are your arrows; nations fall under you: pierced to the heart are the foes of the king.
019	PSA	045	006	Your throne shall endure for ever and ever your royal sceptre a sceptre of equity.
019	PSA	045	007	Right you love and wrong you hate: therefore the Lord your God anoints you With oil of gladness above your fellows.
019	PSA	045	008	With myrrh, aloes, and cassia your robes are all fragrant, you are gladdened by music of ivory harps.
019	PSA	045	009	King’s daughters stand ready with jewels for you, at your right hand the queen in gold of Ophir.
019	PSA	045	010	Listen, daughter, and see; and incline your ear: forget your folk and your father’s house.
019	PSA	045	011	And when the king desires your beauty, bow to him, for he is your lord.
019	PSA	045	012	So shall the Tyrians come with gifts, and the richest of people will do you homage.
019	PSA	045	013	The king’s daughter is glorious altogether, with dress of pearls inwrought with gold.
019	PSA	045	014	In many-coloured robes she is led to the king, with the virgin companions she brought in her train.
019	PSA	045	015	The king’s palace they enter with joy and rejoicing.
019	PSA	045	016	May sons of yours take the place of your fathers, whom you will make princes in all the land.
019	PSA	045	017	Your name will I celebrate world without end, so that nations shall praise you for ever and ever.
019	PSA	046	001	For the leader. Of the Korahites, on alamoth. A song. God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.
019	PSA	046	002	So we have no fear, though earth should change, and the hills totter into the heart of the ocean.
019	PSA	046	003	Let its waters roar and foam, let the mountains shake with the swelling thereof. On our side is the Lord of hosts, our sure defence is the God of Jacob. (Selah)
019	PSA	046	004	A river there is, whose streams make glad God’s city, the home the Most High has hallowed.
019	PSA	046	005	God is within her: she cannot be shaken. God helps her at the turn of the morning.
019	PSA	046	006	Nations roared, kingdoms tottered: he uttered his voice, earth melted away.
019	PSA	046	007	On our side is the Lord of hosts, our sure defence is the God of Jacob.
019	PSA	046	008	Come and see what the Lord has done, working appallingly in the earth.
019	PSA	046	009	He stills wars to the ends of the earth – breaking the bow, snapping the spear, burning the chariots in the fire.
019	PSA	046	010	‘Refrain; and know surely that I am God, high over the nations, high over the world.’
019	PSA	046	011	On our side is the Lord of Hosts, our sure defence is the God of Jacob. (Selah)
019	PSA	047	001	For the leader. Of the Korahites. A psalm. Clap your hands, all you peoples: shout to God in ringing cries.
019	PSA	047	002	For the Lord is most high and dread, a great king over all the earth.
019	PSA	047	003	He subdues the peoples under us, the nations under our feet;
019	PSA	047	004	he chooses our heritage for us, the glory of Jacob whom he loves. (Selah)
019	PSA	047	005	God is gone up with a shout, the Lord with the sound of a trumpet.
019	PSA	047	006	Sing praise to our God, sing praises: sing praise to our king, sing praises.
019	PSA	047	007	For king of all earth is he: praise God in a skilful song.
019	PSA	047	008	God is king over all the nations, God sits on his holy throne.
019	PSA	047	009	Princes of nations gather with the people of Abraham’s God: for the shields of the earth are God’s; greatly exalted is he.
019	PSA	048	001	A song. A psalm of the Korahites. Great is the Lord and worthy all praise in the city of our God. His holy mountain,
019	PSA	048	002	that rises so fair, is the joy of all the world. Like the mount of the gods is Mount Zion, the city of the great king.
019	PSA	048	003	Once God made himself known as the defence of her palaces.
019	PSA	048	004	For see! A concert of kings passed over the frontier together.
019	PSA	048	005	But one glance, and they were astounded; they hastened away in dismay.
019	PSA	048	006	Trembling took hold of them there, like the pains of a woman in labour.
019	PSA	048	007	They were shattered, as east wind shatters the giant ships in pieces.
019	PSA	048	008	What we heard, we now have seen in the city of the Lord of hosts, the city of our God. God will uphold her forever. (Selah)
019	PSA	048	009	We think, O God, of your love, in the midst of your temple.
019	PSA	048	010	Your fame, O God, like your name, shall extend to the ends of the earth. Victory fills your hand.
019	PSA	048	011	Let mount Zion be glad; let the daughters of Judah rejoice because of your judgments.
019	PSA	048	012	Walk about Zion, go round her; count her towers.
019	PSA	048	013	Set your mind on her ramparts, consider her palaces; that you tell to the next generation
019	PSA	048	014	That such is God, our God he it is who shall guide us for ever and ever.
019	PSA	049	001	For the leader. Of the Korahites. A psalm. Hear this, you peoples all; attend, all you who live in the world
019	PSA	049	002	people of low degree and high, the rich and the poor together.
019	PSA	049	003	My mouth shall utter wisdom, the thoughts of a seeing heart.
019	PSA	049	004	I incline my ear to a proverb, on the lyre I will open my riddle.
019	PSA	049	005	Why should I be afraid in the days of misfortune, when circled by wicked and cunning foes,
019	PSA	049	006	who put their trust in their wealth, and boast of their boundless riches?
019	PSA	049	007	For assuredly no one can ransom themselves, or give to God the price of their life,
019	PSA	049	008	for the ransom of a life is costly, no payment is ever enough,
019	PSA	049	009	to keep them alive for ever and ever, so as never to see the pit at all.
019	PSA	049	010	But see it they will. Even wise people die, the fool and the brutish perish alike, and abandon their wealth to others.
019	PSA	049	011	The grave is their everlasting home, the place they shall live in for ever and ever, though after their own names they called whole lands.
019	PSA	049	012	Despite their wealth, they perish like dumb animals.
019	PSA	049	013	This is the fate of the confident fool, and the end of those who are pleased with their portion. (Selah)
019	PSA	049	014	Like sheep they descend to Sheol with Death for their shepherd; down they go straight to the grave, and their form wastes away in their home below.
019	PSA	049	015	But God will assuredly ransom my life from the hand of Sheol; for he will receive me. (Selah)
019	PSA	049	016	So be not afraid when someone grows rich, when the wealth of their house increases.
019	PSA	049	017	Not a shred of it all can they take when they die, wealth cannot follow them down.
019	PSA	049	018	Though they count themselves happy, when they are alive, and win praise from many for faring so well,
019	PSA	049	019	they must join their ancestors, who see the light nevermore.
019	PSA	049	020	The wealthy are without understanding, they perish like dumb animals.
019	PSA	050	001	A psalm of Asaph. The Lord God has spoken: He summons the earth from sunrise to sunset.
019	PSA	050	002	From Zion, perfection of beauty, God’s glory shines forth.
019	PSA	050	003	Our God comes, he cannot keep silence, devouring fire is before him, and furious tempest around him.
019	PSA	050	004	He summons the heavens above and the earth to judge his people.
019	PSA	050	005	Gather to him his saints by covenant-sacrifice bound to him;
019	PSA	050	006	that the heavens may declare his justice, for a God of justice is he. (Selah)
019	PSA	050	007	‘Hear, O my people, and I will speak, and protest to you, O Israel: I am the Lord, your God.
019	PSA	050	008	Not for your sacrifices will I reprove you your burnt-offerings are ever before me
019	PSA	050	009	Not a bullock will I take from your house, nor male goats out of your folds;
019	PSA	050	010	for all beasts of the forest are mine, and the kine on a thousand hills.
019	PSA	050	011	I know all the birds of the air, all that moves on the fields is mine.
019	PSA	050	012	Were I hungry, I would not tell you, for the world and its fulness are mine.
019	PSA	050	013	Am I such as to eat bulls’ flesh, or drink the blood of goats?
019	PSA	050	014	Offer to God a thank-offering, pay the Most High your vows.
019	PSA	050	015	Summon me in the day of distress, I will rescue you, so will you honour me.’
019	PSA	050	016	But to the wicked God says: ‘What right have you to talk of my statutes, or take my covenant into your mouth
019	PSA	050	017	while you yourself hate correction, and cast my words behind you?
019	PSA	050	018	When you see a thief, you run with them; with adulterers you keep company.
019	PSA	050	019	You let your mouth loose for evil, your tongue contrives deceit.
019	PSA	050	020	You shamefully speak of your kin, and slander your own mother’s son.
019	PSA	050	021	And because I kept silence at this, you did take me for one like yourself. But I will convict you and show you plainly.
019	PSA	050	022	‘Now you who forget God, mark this, lest I rend you, past hope of deliverance.
019	PSA	050	023	Those who bring a thank-offering honour me; but to those: who follows my way, I will show the salvation of God.’
019	PSA	051	001	For the leader. A psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet come to him after he had been with Bathsheba. In your kindness, O God, be gracious to me, in your own great pity blot out my transgressions.
019	PSA	051	002	Wash me clean of my guilt, make me pure of my sin.
019	PSA	051	003	For well I know my transgressions, my sin is ever before me.
019	PSA	051	004	Against you, only you, have I sinned, and done that which is wrong in your sight: you therefore are just when you speak, and clear when you utter judgment.
019	PSA	051	005	See! In guilt was I brought to the birth, and in sin did my mother conceive me.
019	PSA	051	006	It’s the innermost truth you desire, give me therefore true wisdom of heart.
019	PSA	051	007	Purge me clean with hyssop, wash me whiter than snow.
019	PSA	051	008	Fill me with joy and gladness, let the bones you have broken rejoice.
019	PSA	051	009	Hide your face from my sins, and blot out my guilt altogether.
019	PSA	051	010	Create me a clean heart, O God, put a new steadfast spirit within me.
019	PSA	051	011	Cast me not forth from your presence, withdraw not your holy spirit.
019	PSA	051	012	Give me back the joy of your help, with a willing spirit sustain me.
019	PSA	051	013	I will teach your ways to transgressors, and sinners shall turn to you.
019	PSA	051	014	Save me from blood, O God, and my tongue shall ring out your faithfulness.
019	PSA	051	015	Open my lips, O Lord, and my mouth shall declare your praise.
019	PSA	051	016	For in sacrifice you have no pleasure, in gifts of burnt-offering no delight.
019	PSA	051	017	The sacrifice pleasing to God is a spirit that is broken; a heart that is crushed, O God, you will not despise.
019	PSA	051	018	Do good in your pleasure to Zion, build the walls of Jerusalem.
019	PSA	051	019	Then will you welcome the due forms of sacrifice, then on your altars shall bullocks be offered.
019	PSA	052	001	For the leader. A maskil of David, when Doeg the Edomite came and told Saul that David had gone to Abimelech’s house. Why glory in mischief, you hero? God’s kindness is all the day.
019	PSA	052	002	Engulfing ruin you plot, your tongue like a razor sharpened, you practiser of deceit.
019	PSA	052	003	Evil, not good, you love, and falsehood, not words of truth. (Selah)
019	PSA	052	004	But you love all words that devour, and a tongue that is given to deceit.
019	PSA	052	005	But God, on his part, shall destroy you forever, grasp you and pluck you out of your tent, and root you out of the land of the living. (Selah)
019	PSA	052	006	Smitten with awe at the sight, the righteous shall laugh at you.
019	PSA	052	007	‘Look’ (they will say) ‘at the hero who did not make God his stronghold, but trusted in his great wealth and in the strength of his riches.’
019	PSA	052	008	But I am like a fresh olive-tree in the house of God. I trust in the kindness of God for ever and evermore.
019	PSA	052	009	I will render you thanks for ever for what you have done. I will tell how good you are in the presence of those who love you.
019	PSA	053	001	For the leader. On mahalath. A maskil of David. Fools say in their heart, ‘There is no God.’ Vile, hateful their life is; not one does good.
019	PSA	053	002	From heaven God looks out on humans, to see if any are wise, and care for God.
019	PSA	053	003	But all have turned bad, the taint is on all; not one does good, no, not one.
019	PSA	053	004	Have they learned their lesson, those workers of evil? Who ate up my people, eating, devouring, never calling to the Lord.
019	PSA	053	005	Sore afraid will they be, where no fear was; when God scatters the bones of the godless people. They will be put to shame, when God rejects them.
019	PSA	053	006	If only help from Zion would come for Israel! When God brings his people a change of fortune, how glad will be Jacob, and Israel how joyful!
019	PSA	054	001	For the leader. With stringed instruments. A maskil of David, when the Ziphites came and said to Saul, “David is in hiding among us”. Save me, O God, by your name, by your power secure for me justice.
019	PSA	054	002	Listen, O God, to my prayer, attend to the words of my mouth.
019	PSA	054	003	For proud men have risen against me, and terrible men seek my life, men who do not set God before them. (Selah)
019	PSA	054	004	But see! God is my helper, the Lord is sustaining my life.
019	PSA	054	005	Let their evil fall back on my foes: cut them off in your faithfulness, Lord.
019	PSA	054	006	Then will I bring you glad sacrifice, praising your gracious name;
019	PSA	054	007	for from all distress you have saved me, and feasted my eyes on my foes.
019	PSA	055	001	For the leader. With stringed instruments. A maskil of David. Listen, God, to my prayer. Don’t hide yourself from my pleading.
019	PSA	055	002	Hear me, and answer; for bitter is my lament.
019	PSA	055	003	I am wild with the noise of the foe, with the clamour of the ungodly; for they hurl disaster upon me, and attack me with fury.
019	PSA	055	004	My heart shudders within me, terrors of deaths press on me,
019	PSA	055	005	fear and trembling attack me, and horror wraps me round.
019	PSA	055	006	O for the wings of a dove: I would fly away and rest.
019	PSA	055	007	I would wander far away, find refuge in the wilderness. (Selah)
019	PSA	055	008	I would find myself a shelter from raging wind and tempest.
019	PSA	055	009	Confuse them, Lord, upset their plans; for I see violence and strife in the city.
019	PSA	055	010	By day and by night they make their rounds on the city walls, while within is crime and trouble,
019	PSA	055	011	within is ruin. Her market-place is never free of deceit and tyranny.
019	PSA	055	012	The taunts were not those of a foe that I could have borne; the disdain was not that of an enemy I could have shunned them:
019	PSA	055	013	but it was you, my equal, my dear and familiar friend.
019	PSA	055	014	We used to be so close, together we walked in God’s house with the crowd.
019	PSA	055	015	May death suddenly take them, may they go down to Sheol alive, for evil lives in their homes and their hearts.
019	PSA	055	016	But I will call on God, the Lord will save me.
019	PSA	055	017	Evening and morning and noon I lament and moan. He will hear my voice;
019	PSA	055	018	though I am attacked by many he will rescue me, unharmed from the war.
019	PSA	055	019	God, who sits on his ancient throne will hear and will humble them, for they never change, they never fear God. (Selah)
019	PSA	055	020	My friend turned against me, betrayed his word.
019	PSA	055	021	His mouth was smoother than butter, but war filled his heart. His words were softer than oil, but sharper than swords.
019	PSA	055	022	Cast your burden on the Lord, and he will sustain you. He will never let the righteous be shaken.
019	PSA	055	023	But you, God, will hurl them down to the deepest pit. Bloody and treacherous people will not live out half their days; but I will trust you.
019	PSA	056	001	For the leader. On jonath elem rehokim. Of David. A michtam, when the Philistines seized him in Gath. O God, be gracious to me, for people trample upon me, all the day righting and pressing me.
019	PSA	056	002	All the day enemies trample me; many there be who contend with me bitterly.
019	PSA	056	003	In the day of my terror I trust in you.
019	PSA	056	004	In God I maintain my cause, in God I fearlessly trust. What can flesh do to me?
019	PSA	056	005	They torture me all the day, they ceaselessly plan to hurt me,
019	PSA	056	006	banded together in secret, watching my every step, as those who hope for my death.
019	PSA	056	007	Pay them out for their sin, O God, hurl down the strong in your anger.
019	PSA	056	008	You yourself count my wanderings. Put in your bottle my tears are they not in your book?
019	PSA	056	009	Then shall my foes be turned back in the day that I call. Of this I am sure, because God is for me.
019	PSA	056	010	In God I maintain my cause, in the Lord I maintain my cause.
019	PSA	056	011	In God I fearlessly trust, what can people do to me?
019	PSA	056	012	Your vows are upon me, O God, I will render thank-offerings to you;
019	PSA	056	013	because you have saved me from death, my feet from stumbling, to the end that I walk before God in the light of the living.
019	PSA	057	001	For the leader. Al tashheth. A michtam of David, when he fled from Saul into a cave. Be gracious, O God, be gracious to me, for in you I take shelter. In your sheltering wings I take refuge, till ruin be over past.
019	PSA	057	002	I cry to the Most High God, to the God who accomplishes for me.
019	PSA	057	003	He will send me his succour from heaven, he will thrust away those who would trample me. (Selah)
019	PSA	057	004	In the midst of lions I lie, who devour human prey. Their teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue is a sharpened sword.
019	PSA	057	005	Be exalted, God, o’er the heavens, and your glory o’er all the earth.
019	PSA	057	006	They set a net for my feet, but in it was their own foot caught. Before me they dug a pit, but they fell into it themselves. (Selah)
019	PSA	057	007	My heart is steadfast, O God, my heart is steadfast. I would sing, I would make music;
019	PSA	057	008	awake, my soul. Awake, harp and lyre; I would wake the dawn.
019	PSA	057	009	I would praise you among the peoples, O Lord, and make music among the nations to you;
019	PSA	057	010	for great to heaven is your love, and your faithfulness to the clouds.
019	PSA	057	011	Be exalted, God, o’er the heavens, and your glory o’er all the earth.
019	PSA	058	001	For the leader. Al tashheth. Of David. A michtam. Do you speak what is right, you gods? With equity judge you your people?
019	PSA	058	002	In the land you practise iniquity – all of you; violence do you dispense with your hands.
019	PSA	058	003	The wicked go astray from the womb liars take the wrong path from their birth.
019	PSA	058	004	Venom have they like the venom of snakes, they are like the deaf adder that stops her ears,
019	PSA	058	005	and refuses to listen to the voice of the charmer, or binder of spells, no matter how cunning.
019	PSA	058	006	O God, break to pieces the teeth in their mouth, tear out the great teeth of the young lions, Lord.
019	PSA	058	007	May they melt away like running water! Like tender grass, cut down may they be!
019	PSA	058	008	Like the snail that dissolves on its crawling path, like the birth untimely which sees not the sunlight.
019	PSA	058	009	Faster than a thorn-fire heats your pots, he will come with his tempest and sweep them away.
019	PSA	058	010	The sight of such vengeance will gladden the righteous; their feet they will wash in the blood of the wicked.
019	PSA	058	011	People will say, ‘Yes, the just are rewarded: yes, on the earth is a God who is Judge.’
019	PSA	059	001	For the leader. Al tashheth. Of David. A michtam, when Saul sent men to watch his house in order to kill him. Save me, O God, from my enemies; secure me from my assailants.
019	PSA	059	002	Save me from those who do wrong, save me from the bloodthirsty.
019	PSA	059	003	For see! They lay ambush for me, strong men are banded against me not for sin or transgression of mine, for no guilt of mine, O Lord,
019	PSA	059	004	they run and make ready. Awake! Come forth to meet me, and see!
019	PSA	059	005	You, O Lord of hosts, God of Israel, awake! And punish the proud, every one; spare none of the traitors vile. (Selah)
019	PSA	059	006	At evening they come, and, howling like dogs, make their round in the city.
019	PSA	059	007	Look at their venomous mouths, tongues like swords, they think no one hears them.
019	PSA	059	008	But you, Lord, laugh at them, you mock all the insolent.
019	PSA	059	009	My strength, I will sing to you, for God is my sure retreat.
019	PSA	059	010	My God with his love will meet me, and feast my eyes on my foes.
019	PSA	059	011	Slay them not, lest my people forget, let your hosts keep them roaming and wandering.
019	PSA	059	012	In their sinful speech snare them, O Lord; and may they be trapped in their pride, for the curses and lies that they utter.
019	PSA	059	013	In your wrath make a clean end of them, that people, to the ends of the earth, may know that God rules in Jacob. (Selah)
019	PSA	059	014	At evening they come, and, howling like dogs, make their round in the city.
019	PSA	059	015	They roam about for a feast, and snarl, if they get not their fill.
019	PSA	059	016	But I will sing of your might; I will ring out your love in the morning. For to me you have been a sure refuge, a retreat in the day of my trouble.
019	PSA	059	017	My strength, I will sing praise to you, for God is my sure retreat, my faithful God.
019	PSA	060	001	For the leader. On shushan eduth. A michtam of David (for teaching), when he fought with Aram-naharaim and Aram-zobah, and Joab returned and defeated twelve thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt. O God, you have spurned and broken us, routing us in your wrath – restore us!
019	PSA	060	002	You have shaken the land and cleft it; heal its tottering breaches.
019	PSA	060	003	You have made your people drink hardship, and given us wine of reeling.
019	PSA	060	004	You have given those who fear you a banner, a rallying-place from the bow, (Selah)
019	PSA	060	005	for the rescue of your beloved. Save by your right hand and answer us.
019	PSA	060	006	God did solemnly swear: ‘As victor will I divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.
019	PSA	060	007	Mine is Gilead, mine is Manasseh, Ephraim is the defence of my head, Judah my sceptre of rule,
019	PSA	060	008	Moab the pot that I wash in, Edom – I cast my shoe over it, I shout o’er Philistia in triumph.’
019	PSA	060	009	O to be brought to the fortified city! O to be led into Edom!
019	PSA	060	010	Have you not spurned us, O God? You do not march forth with our armies.
019	PSA	060	011	Grant us help from the foe, for human help is worthless.
019	PSA	060	012	With God we shall yet do bravely: he himself will tread down our foes.
019	PSA	061	001	For the leader. On stringed instruments. Of David. Hear my cry, O God, be attentive to my prayer.
019	PSA	061	002	From the ends of the earth I call unto you, when my heart is faint: lead me to the rock that is high above me.
019	PSA	061	003	For you are a refuge to me, a strong tower in face of the foe.
019	PSA	061	004	O to be guest in your tent forever, hiding beneath your sheltering wings! (Selah)
019	PSA	061	005	For you, O God, do hear my vows, and grant the desires of those who fear you.
019	PSA	061	006	Add many days to the life of the king; may his years endure throughout all generations.
019	PSA	061	007	In the presence of God be he throned forever; may kindness and faithfulness watch over him.
019	PSA	061	008	And I will sing praise to your name forever, paying my vows day after day.
019	PSA	062	001	For the leader. On jeduthun. A psalm of David. I wait alone in silence for God; From him comes my help.
019	PSA	062	002	Yes, he is my rock, my help, my retreat, I shall not be shaken too sorely.
019	PSA	062	003	How long will you, all of you, batter a man, as one might a leaning wall?
019	PSA	062	004	From his height they are planning to topple him. They take pleasure in falsehood; they bless with their mouth, but inwardly they curse. (Selah)
019	PSA	062	005	I wait alone in silence for God; for from him comes my hope.
019	PSA	062	006	Yes, he is my rock, my help, my retreat, I shall not be shaken too sorely.
019	PSA	062	007	On God rests my honour and safety, in God is my strong rock, my refuge.
019	PSA	062	008	Trust in him, all you people assembled, pour out your heart in his presence; God is a refuge for us. (Selah)
019	PSA	062	009	The lowly are nought but a breath, the lofty are but an illusion: in the balances up they go, they are lighter than breath altogether.
019	PSA	062	010	Trust not in gain of extortion, set no vain hopes in robbery. As for wealth, if it bears fruit, set not your heart upon it.
019	PSA	062	011	One thing God has uttered, two things there are which I heard that power belongs to God,
019	PSA	062	012	and to you, too, O Lord, belongs kindness; for you requite each person according to what they have done.
019	PSA	063	001	A psalm of David, when he was in the wilderness of Judah. O God, my God, you, you do I seek: my heart thirsts for you, my body faints for you in a parched and waterless land.
019	PSA	063	002	As I in the temple have seen you, beholding your power and your glory,
019	PSA	063	003	for better than life is your kindness: my lips shall utter your praise.
019	PSA	063	004	So, while I live, I will bless you, and lift up my hands in your name.
019	PSA	063	005	As with marrow and fat am I feasted; with joyful lips I will praise you.
019	PSA	063	006	I call you to mind on my bed, and muse on you in the night watches;
019	PSA	063	007	for you have been my help, I joyfully sing in the shadow of your wings.
019	PSA	063	008	I cling close after you, your right hand holds me up.
019	PSA	063	009	But those who seek after my life shall go down to the depths of the earth,
019	PSA	063	010	given o’er to the power of the sword, or as prey for jackals to devour.
019	PSA	063	011	But the king shall rejoice in God: all who own his allegiance will glory. For the mouth of the false shall be stopped.
019	PSA	064	001	For the leader. A psalm of David. Hear, O my God, the voice of my lament: guard my life from the dread of the foe.
019	PSA	064	002	Hide me from villains who secretly plot, from the blustering throng of the workers of evil,
019	PSA	064	003	who have sharpened their tongue like a sword, and aimed bitter words like arrows,
019	PSA	064	004	which from ambush they launch at the blameless, shooting swiftly and unafraid.
019	PSA	064	005	They strengthen their wicked purpose, they tell of the snares they have hidden, they say to themselves, ‘Who can see?’
019	PSA	064	006	They think out their crimes full cunningly hidden deep in their crafty hearts.
019	PSA	064	007	But God with his arrow will shoot them, swiftly shall they be smitten.
019	PSA	064	008	For their tongue he will bring them to ruin, all will shudder with horror at the sight of them.
019	PSA	064	009	Then every person, touched to awe, as they ponder what God has wrought, will tell the tale of his deeds.
019	PSA	064	010	In the Lord shall the righteous rejoice, in him shall they take refuge; and all the true-hearted shall glory.
019	PSA	065	001	For the leader. A psalm of David. A song. It is seemly to praise you, O God, in Zion, and to you shall the vow be performed in Jerusalem.
019	PSA	065	002	O you who hear prayer, unto you shall all flesh come.
019	PSA	065	003	Our sins are too mighty for us, our transgressions you only can cover them.
019	PSA	065	004	Happy the person who you choose to live beside you in your courts. O may we be filled with the joys of your house, of your holy temple.
019	PSA	065	005	In dread deeds you loyally answer us, O God of our salvation, whom all ends of the earth put their trust in, and islands far away.
019	PSA	065	006	By your strength you establish the hills, you are armed with might;
019	PSA	065	007	you still the roaring of seas, and the turmoil of nations,
019	PSA	065	008	so that those who live at earth’s bounds are awed at your signs: the lands of the sunrise and sunset you make to ring with joy.
019	PSA	065	009	You visit and water the earth; you greatly enrich her with the river of God, which is full of water. You prepare the corn thereof,
019	PSA	065	010	watering her furrows, settling her ridges; you make her soft with showers, and bless what grows thereon.
019	PSA	065	011	You crown the year with your goodness, your chariot tracks drip with fatness.
019	PSA	065	012	The desert pastures are lush, the hills greened with joy.
019	PSA	065	013	The meadows are clothed with flocks, the valleys are covered with corn; they shout to each other and sing.
019	PSA	066	001	For the leader. A song. A psalm. Shout to God, all the earth,
019	PSA	066	002	sing praise to his glorious name, sing his glorious praise.
019	PSA	066	003	Say to God, ‘How dread are your works, so great is your might that your enemies cringe to you.
019	PSA	066	004	All the earth does homage to you, singing praises to you, singing praise to your name.’ (Selah)
019	PSA	066	005	Come and see what God has done, awe-inspiring is he in his works among people.
019	PSA	066	006	He turns the sea into dry land, and people cross the river on foot. Let us therefore rejoice in him,
019	PSA	066	007	the mighty Ruler eternal, whose eyes keep watch on the nations, that no rebel lift up his head. (Selah)
019	PSA	066	008	O bless our God, you peoples; sound aloud his praise,
019	PSA	066	009	who keeps us in life, and keeps our feet from slipping.
019	PSA	066	010	For you, God, have tested us, have tried us, as silver is tried.
019	PSA	066	011	You did bring us into prison, and put chains upon us,
019	PSA	066	012	you did let people ride over our head. We went through fire and through water, but you led us out to a spacious place.
019	PSA	066	013	I will enter your house with burnt-offerings, I will pay to you my vows,
019	PSA	066	014	which my open lips have uttered, arid my mouth has declared in my straits.
019	PSA	066	015	I will offer you offerings of fatlings, with the odour of burning rams, I will sacrifice bullocks with goats. (Selah)
019	PSA	066	016	Come and hear my story all who fear God – of what he has done for me.
019	PSA	066	017	For my mouth had no sooner invoked him than his praise was under my tongue.
019	PSA	066	018	Had I cherished sin in my heart, the Lord would never have listened.
019	PSA	066	019	But assuredly God has listened, and attended to my loud prayer.
019	PSA	066	020	Blessed be God, who turned not aside my prayer, nor withdrew his kindness from me.
019	PSA	067	001	For the leader. On stringed instruments. A psalm. A song. Bless us, O God, with your favour, let the light of your face fall upon us; (Selah)
019	PSA	067	002	that the world may know your way, and all nations your power to save.
019	PSA	067	003	Let the peoples praise you, O God; let the peoples all of them praise you.
019	PSA	067	004	Let the nations ring out their joy; for you govern the peoples with equity, and guide the nations on earth. (Selah)
019	PSA	067	005	Let the peoples praise you, O God, let the peoples, all of them, praise you.
019	PSA	067	006	The earth has yielded her increase by the blessing of God, our God.
019	PSA	067	007	May this blessing of ours win people to him to all the ends of the earth.
019	PSA	068	001	For the leader. Of David. A psalm. A song. God arises, his enemies scatter: they who hate him flee before him.
019	PSA	068	002	As smoke before wind is driven, as wax melts before fire, so before God vanish the wicked.
019	PSA	068	003	But the righteous rejoice in God’s presence, they exult with exceeding joy.
019	PSA	068	004	Sing to God, make music to his name, his name is the Lord, praise him who rides on the clouds, and exult in his presence.
019	PSA	068	005	Father of orphans, defender of widows, is God in his holy abode.
019	PSA	068	006	God brings home the lonely, he leads forth the prisoner to comfort, so that none but the rebel lives cheerless.
019	PSA	068	007	God, when you went in front of your people in your march through the desert, (Selah)
019	PSA	068	008	earth shook, the heavens poured rain at the presence of God, Sinai’s God at the presence of God, Israel’s God.
019	PSA	068	009	Rain in abundance, God, you did sprinkle, restoring the languishing land of your heritage.
019	PSA	068	010	A dwelling therein your people found: in your goodness, O God, you did care for the poor.
019	PSA	068	011	The Lord spoke the glad tidings of victory, a great army of women proclaim it:
019	PSA	068	012	‘Kings of armies they flee, they flee, and the housewife divides the spoil:
019	PSA	068	013	dove’s wings covered with silver and pinions with shimmer of gold,
019	PSA	068	014	set with stones, like snow upon Zalmon.’
019	PSA	068	015	A mountain of God is the mountain of Bashan, a mountain of peaks is the mountain of Bashan.
019	PSA	068	016	You high-peaked mountains, why look you askance at the mountain which God has desired for his home whereon the Lord will live forever?
019	PSA	068	017	The chariots of God are twice ten thousand: the Lord came from Sinai, his holy place.
019	PSA	068	018	You did mount the height with trains of your captives, and gifts that you had received from the people. The rebels shall live with the Lord God.
019	PSA	068	019	Blest be the Lord who sustains us daily, the God who is also our saviour. (Selah)
019	PSA	068	020	Our God is a God who is saviour. The ways of escape from death are known to the Lord God.
019	PSA	068	021	Yes, God will shatter the head of his foes the rough scalp of those who strut on in their sins.
019	PSA	068	022	The Lord said: ‘I will bring you home from Bashan, home from the depths of the sea,
019	PSA	068	023	that your feet you may bathe in blood, and your dogs lick their share of the foe.’
019	PSA	068	024	In the temple appear God’s triumphal processions, processions in praise of my king and my God,
019	PSA	068	025	with singers in front, and minstrels behind, and maidens with timbrels between them, singing,
019	PSA	068	026	‘You of the well-spring of Israel, bless the Lord God in the dance.’
019	PSA	068	027	There, in front, is Benjamin the little, the princes of Judah beside them, the princes of Zebulon, princes of Naphtali.
019	PSA	068	028	God, show your strength, your godlike might, as you did in the past,
019	PSA	068	029	from your temple that crowns Jerusalem. Kings shall bring tribute to you.
019	PSA	068	030	Rebuke the beast of the reed, the herd of bulls, with the calves of the peoples. Trample down the lovers of lies. Scatter the nations whose joy is in war.
019	PSA	068	031	May they come from Egypt with gifts of oil, Ethiopia haste with full hands to God.
019	PSA	068	032	Sing to God, O you kingdoms of earth, make melody to the Lord. (Selah)
019	PSA	068	033	Praise him who rides on the ancient heavens. See! He utters his voice, his mighty voice.
019	PSA	068	034	Ascribe strength to the God over Israel, whose strength and majesty live in the skies.
019	PSA	068	035	Awe-inspiring is God in his holy place, it is Israel’s God who gives strength and might to his people. Blessed be God.
019	PSA	069	001	For the leader. On shoshannim. Of David. Save me, O God; for the waters are threatening my life.
019	PSA	069	002	I am sunk in depths of mire, where ground there is none. I am come into deep deep waters, the flood overwhelms me.
019	PSA	069	003	I am weary of crying, my throat is parched, my eyes are wasted with waiting for God.
019	PSA	069	004	More than the hairs of my head are those who wantonly hate me. More than my bones in number are those who are falsely my foes. That which I never robbed, how am I then to restore?
019	PSA	069	005	O God, you know my folly, my guilt is not hidden from you.
019	PSA	069	006	Through me let not any be shamed, who wait for you, Lord God of hosts. Through me let not those be confounded who seek you, O God of Israel.
019	PSA	069	007	It’s in your cause that I have borne taunts, and my face has been covered with shame;
019	PSA	069	008	I became to my kindred a foreigner, to my mother’s sons a stranger.
019	PSA	069	009	It was zeal for your house that consumed me, and the insults they hurled at you fell upon me.
019	PSA	069	010	When I chastened myself with fasting, they took occasion to taunt me.
019	PSA	069	011	When I put on a garment of sackcloth, they made me the theme of a taunt-song.
019	PSA	069	012	Those who sit in the gate make sport of me in the music of drunken songs.
019	PSA	069	013	But I pray to you, Lord, for a time of favour. In your great love answer me; with your loyal help, save me
019	PSA	069	014	from sinking down in the mire. Lift me out of the deep deep waters,
019	PSA	069	015	that the rushing flood may not drown me, that the deep may not swallow me up, nor the pit close her mouth upon me.
019	PSA	069	016	Answer me, Lord, in your gracious kindness, turn to me in your great compassion.
019	PSA	069	017	Hide not your face from your servant, for I am in trouble; O answer me speedily.
019	PSA	069	018	Draw near to me, redeem me; because of my enemies, ransom me.
019	PSA	069	019	You know how I am insulted; in your sight are all my foes.
019	PSA	069	020	Insult has broken my heart, past cure are my shame and confusion. For pity I looked – there was none! And for comforters, but I found none.
019	PSA	069	021	Poison they gave me for food, and to slake my thirst they gave vinegar.
019	PSA	069	022	May their table, outspread, be a trap to them, and their peace-offerings be a snare.
019	PSA	069	023	May their eyes be darkened and blind, make them shake without ceasing.
019	PSA	069	024	Pour your indignation upon them, let your burning wrath overtake them.
019	PSA	069	025	May their camp be a desolation, in their tents be there none to live.
019	PSA	069	026	For those whom you struck, they persecute, and those whom you wounded, they pain yet more.
019	PSA	069	027	Charge them with sin upon sin, may they not be acquitted by you.
019	PSA	069	028	From the book of life be they blotted, may their names not be written with the righteous.
019	PSA	069	029	Lift me, O God, by your help above my pain and misery.
019	PSA	069	030	Then will I praise God in song and magnify him with thanksgiving,
019	PSA	069	031	which shall please the Lord better than ox, or than bullock with horns and hoofs.
019	PSA	069	032	The oppressed shall rejoice at the sight. You who seek after God, let your heart revive.
019	PSA	069	033	For the Lord listens to the poor, he does not despise his prisoners.
019	PSA	069	034	Let the heavens and the earth sing his praises, the seas, and all creatures that move in them.
019	PSA	069	035	For God will bring help to Zion, and build up the cities of Judah, his people shall live there in possession.
019	PSA	069	036	His servants’ children shall have it for heritage, and those who love him shall live therein.
019	PSA	070	001	For the leader. Of David. For commemoration. Quickly, God, deliver me, hasten to help me, Lord.
019	PSA	070	002	May those who are seeking my life, be ashamed and confounded.
019	PSA	070	003	May those who delight in my hurt be defeated and brought to dishonour.
019	PSA	070	004	But may all who seek after you rejoice and be glad in you. May all who love your salvation say, ‘Glory to God,’ evermore.
019	PSA	070	005	I am weak and needy: make haste, God, to me. You are my help and deliverer; Lord, don’t delay.
019	PSA	071	001	In you, O Lord, I take refuge, let me never be put to shame.
019	PSA	071	002	In your faithfulness save me and rescue me, bend your ear to me and save me.
019	PSA	071	003	Be to me a rock of defence, a fortified house, to save me; for my rock and my fortress are you.
019	PSA	071	004	Save me, my God, from the hand of the wicked, from the grasp of the unjust and cruel.
019	PSA	071	005	For you, Lord, are my hope, in whom from my youth I have trusted.
019	PSA	071	006	On you have I leaned from my birth; from my mother’s womb it was you who did draw me. In you is my hope evermore.
019	PSA	071	007	I have been as a wonder to many, for you are my refuge and strength.
019	PSA	071	008	All the day long my mouth is filled with your praise and your glory.
019	PSA	071	009	Cast me not off in the time of old age; when my strength is spent, forsake me not.
019	PSA	071	010	For my foes whisper against me, they who watch me take counsel together;
019	PSA	071	011	‘God has left him,’ they say: ‘pursue and seize him, for he is helpless.’
019	PSA	071	012	O God, be not far from me, haste, O my God, to my help.
019	PSA	071	013	Put my foes to shame and dishonour, with insult and shame be they covered.
019	PSA	071	014	But I will never stop hoping, and more and yet more will I praise you.
019	PSA	071	015	All the day long shall my mouth tell your faithfulness and your salvation, though I know not how they may be counted.
019	PSA	071	016	I will tell of the might of the Lord, and your faithfulness praise, you alone.
019	PSA	071	017	You have taught me, O God, from my youth, and till now have I told of your wonders.
019	PSA	071	018	Even in old age and grey hair, O God, do not forsake me. Still would I tell of your might unto all generations to come.
019	PSA	071	019	Your power and your justice, O God, extend as far as the heavens: for great are the things you have done. Who is like you, O God?
019	PSA	071	020	You have caused us to see troubles many, but you will revive us again. From the depths of the earth you will bring me up again.
019	PSA	071	021	You will multiply my greatness, and comfort me again.
019	PSA	071	022	So with harp I will praise you, and your faithfulness, O my God; and make music to you on the lyre, O you Holy One of Israel.
019	PSA	071	023	My lips shall ring out their joy, my mouth shall sing praises to you; all of me, which you have redeemed.
019	PSA	071	024	Yes, all the day long shall my tongue utter your righteousness; for ashamed and confounded are they who were seeking my hurt.
019	PSA	072	001	Of Solomon. Give the king, O God, your own spirit of justice your spirit of right to the son of the king,
019	PSA	072	002	that with right he may judge your people, and your downtrodden ones with justice.
019	PSA	072	003	May the mountains bear weal for the people, and the hills yield fruits of justice.
019	PSA	072	004	The weak may he help to their rights, may he save the sons of the needy and crush the oppressor in pieces.
019	PSA	072	005	May he live as long as the sun, while the moon shines – for ages and ages.
019	PSA	072	006	May he be like the rain on the meadow, like showers that water the earth.
019	PSA	072	007	In his days may justice flourish, and welfare abound, till the moon be no more.
019	PSA	072	008	May he reign from ocean to ocean, from the river to the ends of the earth.
019	PSA	072	009	May his foes bow down before him, his enemies lick the dust.
019	PSA	072	010	May tribute be rendered by kings of the isles and of Tarshish; may gifts be brought by the kings of Sheba and Seba.
019	PSA	072	011	May all kings fall prostrate before him, and all nations yield him their service.
019	PSA	072	012	For he saves the poor when he cries, the helpless and the downtrodden.
019	PSA	072	013	He pities the weak and the poor, he saves the lives of the poor.
019	PSA	072	014	He redeems them from wrong and from violence, for dear is their blood in his sight.
019	PSA	072	015	Long may he live; and may gold of Sheba be given him; prayer, too, be made for him ceaselessly, all the day long may men bless him.
019	PSA	072	016	May the land have abundance of corn, to the tops of the hills may it wave. May the fruit thereof flourish like Lebanon, may men spring from the city like grass of the earth.
019	PSA	072	017	May his name be blessed forever, may his fame endure as the sun. May all nations envy his blessedness, all tribes of the earth call him happy.
019	PSA	072	018	Blest be the Lord God, Israel’s God, who alone does wonders;
019	PSA	072	019	And blest be forever his glorious name. Let all the earth be filled with his glory. Amen and Amen.
019	PSA	072	020	Here end the prayers of David, son of Jesse.
019	PSA	073	001	A psalm of Asaph. Yes, God is good to the upright, the Lord to the pure in heart.
019	PSA	073	002	But my feet were almost gone, my steps had nearly slipped,
019	PSA	073	003	through envy of godless braggarts, when I saw how well they fared.
019	PSA	073	004	For never a pang have they, their body is sound and sleek.
019	PSA	073	005	They have no trouble like mortals, no share in human pain.
019	PSA	073	006	So they wear their pride like a necklace, they put on the garment of wrong,
019	PSA	073	007	their eyes stand out with fatness, their heart swells with riotous fancies.
019	PSA	073	008	Their speech is mocking and evil, condescending and crooked their speech.
019	PSA	073	009	They have set their mouth in the heavens, while their tongue struts about on the earth.
019	PSA	073	010	Small wonder that people resort to them, and drink deep draughts of their lore.
019	PSA	073	011	‘How does God know?’ they say, ‘And has the Most High any knowledge?’
019	PSA	073	012	See! These are the godless, with wealth and ease ever increasing.
019	PSA	073	013	Yes, in vain have I kept my heart pure, and washed my hands in innocence;
019	PSA	073	014	for all the day long was I plagued not a morning but I was chastised.
019	PSA	073	015	But to resolve to speak like they do would be treachery to your children.
019	PSA	073	016	So I sought to understand it, but a wearisome task it seemed:
019	PSA	073	017	till I entered the holy world of God and saw clearly their destiny.
019	PSA	073	018	Yes, you set them on slippery places; down to destruction you hurl them.
019	PSA	073	019	One moment and then what a horror of ruin! They are finished and ended in terrors.
019	PSA	073	020	Like a dream, when one wakes, shall they be, whose phantoms the waker despises.
019	PSA	073	021	So my bitterness of mind and the pain that stabbed my heart
019	PSA	073	022	show how dull I was and stupid just like a beast before you.
019	PSA	073	023	But I am always with you, you have hold of my right hand.
019	PSA	073	024	By a plan of yours you guide me and will afterward take me to glory.
019	PSA	073	025	Whom have I in the heavens but you? And on earth there is none I desire beside you.
019	PSA	073	026	Though flesh and heart waste away, yet God is the rock of my heart, yet God is my portion forever.
019	PSA	073	027	For see! Those who are far from you must perish, you destroy all who are false to you.
019	PSA	073	028	But I am happy when close to God; the Lord my God I have made my refuge, that I may recount all the things you have done.
019	PSA	074	001	A maskil of Asaph. Why, O God, have you spurned us forever? Why smokes your wrath against the sheep of your pasture?
019	PSA	074	002	Remember the community you purchased of old to become by redemption the tribe of your heritage, Zion, the mountain you made your home.
019	PSA	074	003	Rouse yourself, visit its ruins complete. In the temple the foe has made havoc of all things.
019	PSA	074	004	Like lions your enemies roared through your house, replacing our symbols by signs of their own,
019	PSA	074	005	hacking, like woodsmen who lift axes on thickets of trees,
019	PSA	074	006	smashing with hatchets and hammers all of its carved work together.
019	PSA	074	007	They have set your temple on fire, to the very ground they have outraged the place where lives your name.
019	PSA	074	008	They have said in their heart, ‘Let us utterly crush them.’ They have burned all the houses of God in the land.
019	PSA	074	009	No symbol of ours do we see any more: no prophet is there any more, none is with us who knows how long.
019	PSA	074	010	How long, O God, is the foe to insult? Shall the enemy spurn your name forever?
019	PSA	074	011	Why, O Lord, do you hold back your hand, why keep your right hand in the folds of your robe?
019	PSA	074	012	Yet God is our king from the ancient days, in the midst of the earth working deeds of salvation.
019	PSA	074	013	It was you who did cleave the sea by your might, and shatter the heads of the ocean monsters.
019	PSA	074	014	It was you who did crush many-headed Leviathan, and give him as food to the beasts of the wilderness.
019	PSA	074	015	It was you who did cleave the fountains and torrents; it was you who did dry the perennial streams.
019	PSA	074	016	Yours is the day; yours, too, is the night, it was you who did establish the sun and the star.
019	PSA	074	017	It was you who did fix all the borders of earth: summer and winter it’s you who have made them.
019	PSA	074	018	Yet, for all this, the foe has insulted you, Lord, and a nation of fools has reviled your name.
019	PSA	074	019	Do not give your dove to the beasts, do not forget your afflicted forever.
019	PSA	074	020	Look to the sleek ones – how full they are: the dark places of earth are the dwellings of violence.
019	PSA	074	021	O let not the downtrodden turn back ashamed: let the poor and the needy sing praise to your name.
019	PSA	074	022	Arise, God, and defend your cause: remember how fools all the day insult you.
019	PSA	074	023	Do not forget the uproar of your enemies, the din of your foes that ascends evermore.
019	PSA	075	001	For the leader; al tashheth. A psalm of Asaph, a song. We praise you, God, we praise you: we would call on your name and declare your wonders.
019	PSA	075	002	‘At the time I choose, I will judge fairly.
019	PSA	075	003	Though earth melt and all her inhabitants, it is I who keep steady her pillars.’ (Selah)
019	PSA	075	004	I say to the boasters, ‘Boast not’; to the wicked, ‘Lift not up your horn:
019	PSA	075	005	lift not your horn on high, speak not boldly against the Rock.’
019	PSA	075	006	For not from east nor west, not from desert nor mountains;
019	PSA	075	007	but God himself is the judge, humbling one and exalting another.
019	PSA	075	008	In the hand of the Lord is a cup foaming wine, richly spiced. Out of this he pours a draught, and all the wicked of earth must drain it down to the dregs.
019	PSA	075	009	But I will rejoice forever, singing praise to the God of Jacob.
019	PSA	075	010	I will hew all the horns of the wicked, but the horns of the just shall be lifted.
019	PSA	076	001	For the leader. With instrumental music. A psalm of Asaph, a song. God has made himself known in Judah, his name is great in Israel.
019	PSA	076	002	His tent is in Salem, his dwelling in Zion.
019	PSA	076	003	There he broke the lightning arrows, shield, sword, and weapons of war. (Selah)
019	PSA	076	004	Terrible is your splendour on the everlasting mountains.
019	PSA	076	005	Despoiled were the stout of heart; in the sleep into which they had fallen, none of the warriors could lift a hand.
019	PSA	076	006	At your rebuke, God of Jacob, sank chariot and horse to sleep.
019	PSA	076	007	Awful are you: who can stand before you, when once you are angry?
019	PSA	076	008	The judgment you gave from heaven frightened the earth into silence,
019	PSA	076	009	when God arose to judgment to save the oppressed of the earth. (Selah)
019	PSA	076	010	The fiercest will praise you, to you will the remnant hold festival.
019	PSA	076	011	Vow and pay to Lord your God, and let all who are round him bring presents.
019	PSA	076	012	He lops off the courage of princes, and with terror fills kings of the earth.
019	PSA	077	001	For the leader. On Jeduthun. Of Asaph, a psalm. Loudly will I lift my cry to God, loudly to God, so he hears to me.
019	PSA	077	002	In the day of my trouble I seek the Lord; in the night I lift my hands in prayer, refusing all comfort.
019	PSA	077	003	When I think of God, I moan; when I muse, my spirit is faint. (Selah)
019	PSA	077	004	When you hold my eyes awake, and I am restless and speechless,
019	PSA	077	005	I think of the days of old, call to mind distant years.
019	PSA	077	006	I commune with my heart in the night, I muse with inquiring spirit.
019	PSA	077	007	‘Will the Lord cast us off forever, will he be gracious no more?
019	PSA	077	008	Has his love vanished forever? Is his faithfulness utterly gone?
019	PSA	077	009	Has God forgotten to be gracious, or in anger withheld his compassion?’ (Selah)
019	PSA	077	010	Then I said, ‘This it is that grieves me, that the hand of the Most High has changed.’
019	PSA	077	011	I will think of the deeds of the Lord, and remember your wonders of old.
019	PSA	077	012	I will muse on all you have wrought, and meditate on your deeds.
019	PSA	077	013	Then your way, O God, was majestic: what God was great as our God?
019	PSA	077	014	You were a God who did marvels, you did show your power to the world
019	PSA	077	015	by your arm you rescued your people, the children of Jacob and Joseph. (Selah)
019	PSA	077	016	The waters saw you, O God. The waters saw you and shivered; to their depths they trembled.
019	PSA	077	017	Clouds poured torrents of water, thunder rolled in the sky, your arrows sped to and fro.
019	PSA	077	018	Loud was the roll of your thunder, lightnings lit up the world. Earth quaked and trembled.
019	PSA	077	019	In your way, Lord, through the sea, in your path through the mighty waters, your footsteps were all unseen.
019	PSA	077	020	You did guide your folk like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
019	PSA	078	001	A maskil of Asaph. My people, attend to my teaching: bend your ears to the words of my mouth,
019	PSA	078	002	as I open my mouth in a poem on the riddling story of the past.
019	PSA	078	003	What we have heard and known, and what our ancestors have told us,
019	PSA	078	004	we will not hide from their children. We will tell to the next generation the praises and might of the Lord, and the wonders that he has done.
019	PSA	078	005	He set up a testimony in Jacob, a law he appointed in Israel, which he commanded our ancestors to make known to their children,
019	PSA	078	006	that the next generation should know it, that the children yet to be born should arise and tell their children;
019	PSA	078	007	that in God they might put their confidence, and not forget God’s works; but that they might keep his commandments,
019	PSA	078	008	and not be like their ancestors, a generation defiant and stubborn, a generation with heart unsteady, and spirit unfaithful towards God.
019	PSA	078	009	Ephraimites, armed bowmen, turned back in the day of battle.
019	PSA	078	010	They did not keep God’s covenant, they refused to walk in his law.
019	PSA	078	011	They forgot what he had done, and the wonders he had shown them.
019	PSA	078	012	He did wonders before their ancestors in the country of Zoan in Egypt.
019	PSA	078	013	Through the sea which he split he brought them, making waters stand up like a heap;
019	PSA	078	014	he led them by day with a cloud, all the night with a light of fire.
019	PSA	078	015	From the rocks which he split in the wilderness, he gave them to drink as of ocean’s abundance.
019	PSA	078	016	He brought streams out of the rock, and made water run down like rivers.
019	PSA	078	017	Yet they still went on sinning against him, they defied the Most High in the desert.
019	PSA	078	018	They wilfully challenged God, demanding the food that they longed for.
019	PSA	078	019	‘Is God able,’ such was their challenge, ‘to spread in the desert a table?
019	PSA	078	020	From the rock that he struck there gushed water, and torrents that overflowed; but can he also give bread, or provide his people with meat?’
019	PSA	078	021	When the Lord heard this, he was furious, and fire was kindled on Jacob, anger flared up against Israel.
019	PSA	078	022	For they put no trust in God, no confidence in his help.
019	PSA	078	023	So he summoned the clouds above; and, opening the doors of heaven,
019	PSA	078	024	he rained manna upon them for food, and grain of heaven he gave them.
019	PSA	078	025	Everyone ate the bread of angels; he sent them food to the full.
019	PSA	078	026	He launched the east wind in the heavens, and guided the south by his power.
019	PSA	078	027	He rained meat upon them like dust, winged bird like the sand of the sea.
019	PSA	078	028	In the midst of their camp he dropped it, all around their tents.
019	PSA	078	029	They ate and were more than filled; he had brought them the thing they desired.
019	PSA	078	030	But the thing they desired became loathsome: while their food was still in their mouths,
019	PSA	078	031	the wrath of God rose against them. He slew the stoutest among them, and laid low the young men of Israel.
019	PSA	078	032	Yet for all this they sinned yet more, and refused to believe in his wonders.
019	PSA	078	033	So he ended their days in a breath, and their years in sudden dismay.
019	PSA	078	034	When he slew them, then they sought after him, they turned and sought God with diligence.
019	PSA	078	035	They remembered that God was their rock, and the Most High God their redeemer.
019	PSA	078	036	But they flattered him with their mouth, and lied to him with their tongue.
019	PSA	078	037	Their heart was not steady with him, they were faithless to his covenant.
019	PSA	078	038	But he is full of pity: he pardons sin and destroys not. Often he turns his anger away, without stirring his wrath at all.
019	PSA	078	039	So he remembered that they were but flesh, breath that passes and does not return.
019	PSA	078	040	But how often they rebelled in the desert, and caused him grief in the wilderness,
019	PSA	078	041	tempting God again and again, provoking the Holy One of Israel.
019	PSA	078	042	They did not remember his strength, nor the day he redeemed from the foe,
019	PSA	078	043	how he set his signs in Egypt, in the country of Zoan his wonders.
019	PSA	078	044	He turned their canals into blood, their streams undrinkable.
019	PSA	078	045	He sent forth flies, which devoured them; frogs, too, which destroyed them.
019	PSA	078	046	Their crops he gave to the caterpillar, and the fruits of their toil to the locust.
019	PSA	078	047	He slew their vines with hail, and their sycamore trees with frost.
019	PSA	078	048	He delivered their cattle to the hail, and their flocks to bolts of fire.
019	PSA	078	049	He let loose his hot anger among them, fury and wrath and distress, a band of destroying angels.
019	PSA	078	050	He cleared a path for his anger, did not spare them from death, but gave them over to pestilence.
019	PSA	078	051	He struck down all the firstborn in Egypt, the first fruits of their strength in the tents of Ham.
019	PSA	078	052	He led forth his people like sheep, he was guide to his flock in the desert.
019	PSA	078	053	Securely he led them, and free from fear, while their foes were drowned in the sea.
019	PSA	078	054	To his holy realm he brought them, to the mountain his right hand had purchased.
019	PSA	078	055	He drove out the nations before them, and allotted their land for possession, and their tents for Israel to live in.
019	PSA	078	056	Yet they tempted and angered the Most High God, they did not observe his decrees.
019	PSA	078	057	They drew back, false like their ancestors; they failed like a treacherous bow.
019	PSA	078	058	Their shrines stirred him to anger, their idols moved him to jealousy.
019	PSA	078	059	When God heard of this, he was furious, and he spurned Israel utterly.
019	PSA	078	060	He abandoned his home in Shiloh, the tent he had pitched among people.
019	PSA	078	061	He gave his strength up to captivity, his glory to the hands of the foe.
019	PSA	078	062	He gave his people to the sword, he was furious with his own.
019	PSA	078	063	Fire devoured their young men, and their maidens had no marriage-song.
019	PSA	078	064	Their priests fell by the sword, and their widows could not weep.
019	PSA	078	065	Then the Lord awoke as from sleep, like a warrior flushed with wine;
019	PSA	078	066	and he beat back his foes, putting them to perpetual scorn.
019	PSA	078	067	He disowned the tent of Joseph, he rejected the tribe of Ephraim;
019	PSA	078	068	but he chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion, which he loves.
019	PSA	078	069	And he built like the heights his sanctuary, like the earth which he founded forever.
019	PSA	078	070	And he chose David his servant, taking him from the sheepfolds.
019	PSA	078	071	From the mother-ewes he brought him, to be shepherd to Jacob his people, and to Israel his inheritance.
019	PSA	078	072	With upright heart did he shepherd them, and with skilful hands did he guide them.
019	PSA	079	001	A psalm of Asaph. Heathen, O God, have come into your land, defiling your holy temple, and laying Jerusalem in ruins.
019	PSA	079	002	They have given the bodies of your dead servants to the birds of the air to devour, and the flesh of your faithful to the beasts of the field.
019	PSA	079	003	Round about Jerusalem they have poured out their blood like water; and there was no one to bury them.
019	PSA	079	004	On every side our neighbours revile us and mock us and jeer at us.
019	PSA	079	005	How long will you be angry, O Lord? Will your jealousy burn like fire forever?
019	PSA	079	006	Pour out your wrath on the nations that don’t know you, on the kingdoms that do not call on your name.
019	PSA	079	007	For Jacob they devoured, they have desolated his home.
019	PSA	079	008	Do not remember against us our ancestors’ sins; O meet us soon with your pity, for utterly weak are we.
019	PSA	079	009	Help us, O God our saviour, for the renown of your name: for your reputation deliver us and cover over our sins.
019	PSA	079	010	Why should the nations say, ‘Where is their God?’ Let revenge for the outpoured blood of your servants be shown on the heathen before our eyes.
019	PSA	079	011	May the groans of the prisoner come before you; free the children of death by your mighty arm.
019	PSA	079	012	Pay our neighbours back sevenfold for the scorn they have heaped upon you, O Lord.
019	PSA	079	013	Then we, your people, the flock of your pasture, will give thanks to you for evermore, and tell your praise to all generations.
019	PSA	080	001	For the leader. On shoshannim, eduth. Of Asaph, a psalm. Listen, Shepherd of Israel, who leads Joseph like a flock of sheep; from your throne on the cherubs shine forth
019	PSA	080	002	before Ephraim, Manasseh, and Benjamin. Stir up your mighty power, come to our help.
019	PSA	080	003	God, restore us: show us the light of your face, so we may be saved.
019	PSA	080	004	O Lord of hosts, how long is your anger to smoke, despite the prayer of your people?
019	PSA	080	005	You have fed them with bread of tears, you have made them drink tears by the measure.
019	PSA	080	006	The scorn of our neighbours you make us, the laughing-stock of our foes.
019	PSA	080	007	God of hosts, restore us: show us the light of your face, so we may be saved.
019	PSA	080	008	A vine out of Egypt you brought; you did drive out the nations, and plant her;
019	PSA	080	009	in the ground you did clear she struck root, and she filled all the land.
019	PSA	080	010	The shade of her covered the mountains, her branches the cedars of God.
019	PSA	080	011	She sent forth her shoots to the sea, and her branches as far as the River.
019	PSA	080	012	Why have you torn down her fences, and left her to be plucked at by all who pass by,
019	PSA	080	013	to be gnawed by the boar from the forest, and devoured by the beasts of the field?
019	PSA	080	014	O God of hosts, return: look down from heaven and see and visit this vine, and restore her
019	PSA	080	015	the vine which your right hand has planted.
019	PSA	080	016	She is burned with fire and cut down before your stern face they are perishing.
019	PSA	080	017	Support the one you have chosen, the one you have raised for yourself;
019	PSA	080	018	then from you we will never draw back. Preserve us, and we will call on your name.
019	PSA	080	019	Lord, God of hosts, restore us: Show us the light of your face, so we may be saved.
019	PSA	081	001	For the leader. On the gittith. Of Asaph. Sing aloud to God our strength, shout for joy to the God of Jacob.
019	PSA	081	002	Raise a song, sound the timbrel, sweet lyre and harp.
019	PSA	081	003	On the new moon blow the horn, at the full moon, the day of our festival.
019	PSA	081	004	For this is a statute for Israel, a ruling of the God of Jacob,
019	PSA	081	005	a witness he set up in Joseph, when he marched against Egypt’s land, where he heard an unknown voice say:
019	PSA	081	006	‘I removed from your shoulder the burden, and freed your hands from the basket.
019	PSA	081	007	At your call of distress I delivered you, from the thundercloud I answered you. At Meribah’s waters I tested you. (Selah)
019	PSA	081	008	‘Listen, my people, to my warning, O Israel, if you would but listen!
019	PSA	081	009	There must not be a strange god among you, you must bow to no foreign god.
019	PSA	081	010	I am the Lord your God who brought you up out of Egypt. Open your mouth, that I fill it.
019	PSA	081	011	‘But my people did not listen to my voice, Israel would have none of me.
019	PSA	081	012	So to their own hard hearts I left them, to follow their own devices.
019	PSA	081	013	O that my people would listen, that Israel would walk in my ways.
019	PSA	081	014	Soon would I humble their enemies, and turn my hand on their foes.
019	PSA	081	015	Those who hate the Lord would cringe before him in everlasting terror.
019	PSA	081	016	But you would I feed with the richest wheat, and with honey from the rock to your heart’s desire.’
019	PSA	082	001	A psalm of Asaph. God has taken his stand in the divine assembly: in the midst of the gods he holds judgment.
019	PSA	082	002	‘How long will you crookedly judge, and favour the wicked? (Selah)
019	PSA	082	003	Do right by the weak and the orphan, acquit the innocent poor.
019	PSA	082	004	Rescue the weak and the needy, save them from the hand of the wicked.
019	PSA	082	005	‘They have neither knowledge nor insight, in darkness they walk to and fro, while the earth’s foundations totter.
019	PSA	082	006	It was I who appointed you gods, children of the Most High all of you.
019	PSA	082	007	Yet like mortals you will surely die, you will fall like any prince.’
019	PSA	082	008	Arise, O God, judge the earth, for all nations are yours by inheritance.
019	PSA	083	001	A song, a psalm of Asaph. Do not keep silent, O God: hold not your peace, be not still, God.
019	PSA	083	002	For see! Your enemies roar, those who hate you lift up their heads,
019	PSA	083	003	laying crafty plans for your people, and plotting against those you treasure.
019	PSA	083	004	‘Come, let us wipe them out as a nation, so Israel’s name will be mentioned no more.’
019	PSA	083	005	For, conspiring with one accord, they have made a league against you
019	PSA	083	006	Tents of Edom, and Ishmaelites, Moab, and the Hagrites.
019	PSA	083	007	Gebal and Ammon and Amalek, Philistia, with the people of Tyre;
019	PSA	083	008	Syria, too, is confederate, they have strengthened the children of Lot. (Selah)
019	PSA	083	009	Deal with them as you dealt with Midian, with Sisera, with Jabin, at the torrent of Kishon,
019	PSA	083	010	who at Endor were destroyed, and became dung for the field.
019	PSA	083	011	Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb, all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna,
019	PSA	083	012	who said, ‘Let us take for ourselves the meadows of God.’
019	PSA	083	013	Whirl them, my God, like dust, like stubble before the wind.
019	PSA	083	014	As the fire that kindles the forest, as flame that sets mountains ablaze,
019	PSA	083	015	so with your tempest pursue them, terrify them with your hurricane.
019	PSA	083	016	Make them blush with shame; until they seek your name, O Lord.
019	PSA	083	017	Everlasting shame and confusion, disgrace and destruction be theirs.
019	PSA	083	018	Teach those who you alone are most high over all the earth.
019	PSA	084	001	For the leader. On the gittith. Of the Korahites, a psalm. How dearly loved is the place where you live, Lord of hosts!
019	PSA	084	002	How I long and yearn for the courts of the Lord. Now heart and flesh cry for joy to the living God.
019	PSA	084	003	Even the sparrow has found her a home and the swallow a nest, to lay her young, near your altar, Lord of hosts, my king and my God.
019	PSA	084	004	Happy those who live in your house, praising you evermore. (Selah)
019	PSA	084	005	Happy those whose strength is in you, people with pilgrim hearts.
019	PSA	084	006	As they pass through the valley of tears, they make it a place of fountains, clothed with the blessings of early rain.
019	PSA	084	007	From rampart to rampart on they march, till at last God reveals himself in Zion.
019	PSA	084	008	Lord, God of hosts, hear my prayer, attend, O God of Jacob. (Selah)
019	PSA	084	009	Behold, O God, our defender, and look upon your anointed,
019	PSA	084	010	for better a single day in your courts than a thousand in my own chambers: better stand at the door of the house of my God than live in the tents of ungodliness,
019	PSA	084	011	for the Lord is sun and shield, the Lord gives grace and glory. He withholds no good thing from the life that is blameless.
019	PSA	084	012	Lord of hosts, happy those whose trust is in you.
019	PSA	085	001	For the leader. Of the Korahites, a psalm. Once, Lord, you did favour your land, granting change of fortune to Jacob,
019	PSA	085	002	forgiving the guilt of your people, pardoning all their sin, (Selah)
019	PSA	085	003	withdrawing all your fury, turning from your hot anger.
019	PSA	085	004	Restore us, O God our saviour, put away your displeasure against us.
019	PSA	085	005	Will you cherish your anger against us forever, prolonging your wrath to all generations?
019	PSA	085	006	Will you not revive us again, that your people may be glad in you?
019	PSA	085	007	Show us your kindness, O Lord, grant us your salvation.
019	PSA	085	008	Let me hear what God the Lord will speak; for he will speak of peace to his people, to those who love him, and turn their hearts to him.
019	PSA	085	009	Soon those who fear him shall see how he saves, and glory shall live in our land.
019	PSA	085	010	Kindness and loyalty meet; peace and righteousness kiss.
019	PSA	085	011	Loyalty springs from the earth; righteousness looks from the sky.

019	PSA	085	013	righteousness marching before him, and peace on the path he treads.
019	PSA	086	001	A prayer of David. Incline your ear, Lord, and answer me, for I am afflicted and needy.
019	PSA	086	002	Guard me, for I am loyal: save your servant, who trusts in you.
019	PSA	086	003	Lord, be gracious to me, for you are my God; I cry to you all the day.
019	PSA	086	004	Gladden the heart of your servant; for to you, Lord, I set my hope.
019	PSA	086	005	For you, Lord, are good and forgiving, rich in love towards all who call on you.

019	PSA	086	008	None of the gods is like you, Lord, nor are any works like yours.
019	PSA	086	009	All the nations you have made will come and bow down before you, giving glory, O Lord, to your name.
019	PSA	086	010	For great are you, and a doer of wonders; you alone are God.
019	PSA	086	011	Teach me, O Lord, your way, that I may walk in your truth: so my heart shall rejoice in your name.
019	PSA	086	012	I will give you thanks, O Lord, with all my heart, my God, I will honour your name forever.
019	PSA	086	013	For great is your love towards me, from the depths of Sheol you have saved me.
019	PSA	086	014	Haughty men have risen up against me, O God, a band of the violent seeking my life, who think nothing of you.
019	PSA	086	015	But you are a God of pity and grace, patient and rich in kindness and faithfulness; turn to me with your grace, O Lord.
019	PSA	086	016	Grant your strength to your servant, and save the child of your handmaid.
019	PSA	086	017	Show me a sign of your favour, which those who hate me may see with confusion, since you, Lord, are my helper and comforter.
019	PSA	087	001	Of the Korahites, a psalm. A song. On the holy mountain stands the city he founded.
019	PSA	087	002	The Lord loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.
019	PSA	087	003	Glorious things he is speaking of you, you city of God. (Selah)
019	PSA	087	004	‘Among those who are mine I name Rahab and Babylon, Philistia, Tyre, Ethiopia, their people will say I was born in Zion.
019	PSA	087	005	As for Zion it will be said each and all were born in her.’ The Lord will preserve her.
019	PSA	087	006	The Lord will count, when enrolling the peoples, ‘This one was born there, and that one was born there.’ (Selah)
019	PSA	087	007	Singers and dancers alike will say ‘All my springs are in you.’
019	PSA	088	001	A Song, a psalm of the Korahites. To the leader: according to Mahalath Leannoth. A Maskil of Heman the Ezrahite. O Lord my God, I cry for help in the day-time, in the night my cry is before you;
019	PSA	088	002	let my prayer come into your presence, incline your ear to my cry.
019	PSA	088	003	For I am sated with sorrow, my life draws near to Sheol.
019	PSA	088	004	I am counted with those who go down to the pit; without strength am I.
019	PSA	088	005	My home is among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, whom you remember no more cut off as they are from your hand.
019	PSA	088	006	In the deepest pit you have put me, in shadows deep and dark.
019	PSA	088	007	Your wrath lies heavy upon me, waves of your anger roll over me. (Selah)
019	PSA	088	008	You have put my friends far from me, you have made them shun me. I am shut in, and cannot escape,
019	PSA	088	009	my eyes are wasted with sorrow. I call on you, Lord, every day, spreading my hands out to you.
019	PSA	088	010	For the dead can you work wonders? Can the shades rise again to praise you? (Selah)
019	PSA	088	011	Can your kindness be told in the grave, your faithfulness in the tomb?
019	PSA	088	012	Can your wonders be known in the darkness, or your help in the land of forgetfulness?
019	PSA	088	013	I cry for help to you, in the morning my prayer comes before you.
019	PSA	088	014	Why, O Lord, do you spurn me, and hide your face from me?
019	PSA	088	015	From my youth I am wretched and dying, I am numbed by the terrors I bear.
019	PSA	088	016	The fires of your wrath have passed over me, your terrors destroy me,
019	PSA	088	017	surging around me forever, hemming me in altogether.
019	PSA	088	018	Those who love me you put far from me; the dark is my only friend.
019	PSA	089	001	A Maskil of Ethan the Ezrahite. I will sing evermore of the love of the Lord, proclaiming to all generations his faithfulness.
019	PSA	089	002	For your love you did promise to build up forever, your faithfulness firm as the heavens themselves.
019	PSA	089	003	‘I have made with my chosen a covenant, and sworn to David my servant,
019	PSA	089	004	to establish his seed forever, and to build up his throne to all ages.’ (Selah)
019	PSA	089	005	Then the holy assembly in heaven praised your marvellous faithfulness, Lord.
019	PSA	089	006	For who in the skies may compare with the Lord? Who is like the Lord among the gods?
019	PSA	089	007	A God to be feared in the holy assembly, awful and great above all who are round him.
019	PSA	089	008	O Lord God of hosts, who is mighty as you? Your strength and faithfulness, Lord, surround you.
019	PSA	089	009	You are the Lord of the raging sea: when its waves surge, it is you who still them.
019	PSA	089	010	It was you who did pierce and crush Rahab in pieces, and scatter your foes by your mighty arm.
019	PSA	089	011	Yours are the heavens, yours also the earth, the world and its fulness, it’s you who did found them.
019	PSA	089	012	The north and the south, it’s you have created them; Tabor and Hermon shout praise to your name.
019	PSA	089	013	You have an arm with the might of a hero; strong is your hand, high uplifted your right hand.
019	PSA	089	014	Justice and right are the base of your throne, kindness and faithfulness ever attend you.
019	PSA	089	015	Happy the people who know the glad shout, who walk, O Lord, in the light of your face.
019	PSA	089	016	They exult in your name all the day, and your righteousness they extol.
019	PSA	089	017	For you are our strength and our pride. Your favour will lift us to honour.
019	PSA	089	018	For the holy Lord of Israel keeps our defender and king.
019	PSA	089	019	In a vision of old you did speak in this way to the one whom you loved: ‘A crown I have set on the hero I chose to be over the people
019	PSA	089	020	‘I found my servant David, and anointed with holy oil.
019	PSA	089	021	My hand will be with him forever, my arm will give him strength.
019	PSA	089	022	‘No enemy will dare to assail him, nor the wicked to oppress him;
019	PSA	089	023	but his foes I will shatter before him, I will strike down those who hate him.
019	PSA	089	024	‘My loyal love shall attend him, and I will lift him to honour.
019	PSA	089	025	I will set his hand on the sea, and his right hand on the rivers.
019	PSA	089	026	‘As for him, he will call me “My father, my God, and my rock of salvation.”
019	PSA	089	027	And I will make him my firstborn, highest of kings on the earth.
019	PSA	089	028	‘My love will I keep for him ever, my covenant with him shall stand fast.
019	PSA	089	029	His line will I make everlasting, and his throne as the days of the heavens.
019	PSA	089	030	‘If his children forsake my law, and walk not as I have ordained;
019	PSA	089	031	if they profane my statutes, and do not keep my commandments;
019	PSA	089	032	‘I will punish their sin with the rod, their iniquity with scourges.
019	PSA	089	033	But my love will I not take from him, nor will I belie my faithfulness.
019	PSA	089	034	‘I will not profane my covenant by changing the word that has passed my lips.
019	PSA	089	035	Once have I solemnly sworn and I would not lie to David,
019	PSA	089	036	‘that his line should endure forever, and his throne as the sun before me,
019	PSA	089	037	firm as the moon which for ever and ever is fixed in the sky.’ (Selah)
019	PSA	089	038	But you have cast off in contempt, and been furious with your anointed.
019	PSA	089	039	You have spurned the covenant with your servant, and his sacred crown dashed to the ground.
019	PSA	089	040	You have broken down all his walls, and laid his bulwarks in ruins.
019	PSA	089	041	All who pass on their way despoil him, the scorn of his neighbours is he now.
019	PSA	089	042	You have given his foes the victory, and made all his enemies glad.
019	PSA	089	043	You have turned back his sword from the foe, you did not lift him up in the battle.
019	PSA	089	044	The sceptre you took from his hand, and his throne you did hurl to the ground.
019	PSA	089	045	You have shortened the days of his youth, and covered him with shame. (Selah)
019	PSA	089	046	How long, Lord will you hide you forever? How long are the fires of your wrath to burn?
019	PSA	089	047	Remember, Lord, the shortness of life how fleeting you made all people.
019	PSA	089	048	Who can live without seeing death? Who can rescue their life from the clutch of Sheol? (Selah)
019	PSA	089	049	Where, Lord, is your kindness of old, which you in your faithfulness swore to David?
019	PSA	089	050	Remember, O Lord, how your servants are mocked, how I bear in my heart the scorn of all nations
019	PSA	089	051	The scorn which your enemies hurl, O Lord, which they hurl at the footsteps of your anointed.
019	PSA	089	052	Blest be the Lord, for ever and ever. Amen and Amen.
019	PSA	090	001	A prayer of Moses, the man of God. Lord, you have been a home to us one generation after another.
019	PSA	090	002	Before the mountains were born, or the earth and the world were brought forth, from everlasting to everlasting you are God.
019	PSA	090	003	You bring us back to the dust, you summon mortals to return.
019	PSA	090	004	For you see a thousand years as the passing of yesterday, as a watch in the night.
019	PSA	090	005	Your floods sweep them away; they are like a dream, or like grass which sprouts in the morning,
019	PSA	090	006	which blossoms and sprouts in the morning, but by evening is cut and withered.
019	PSA	090	007	For your anger consumes us, the heat of your wrath confounds us.
019	PSA	090	008	Our sins you have set before you, our secrets in the light of your face.
019	PSA	090	009	For through your wrath our days are declining, we bring our years to an end as a sigh.
019	PSA	090	010	The span of our life is seventy years, or, if we are strong, maybe eighty; yet is their breadth but empty toil, for swiftly they go, and we fly away.
019	PSA	090	011	Who lays to heart the power of your anger? Or who stands in reverent awe of your wrath?
019	PSA	090	012	O teach us to count our days so our minds may learn wisdom.
019	PSA	090	013	Return, O Lord; why so long? Relent on your servants.
019	PSA	090	014	Grant us your love to the full in the morning, that all our days we may shout for joy.
019	PSA	090	015	Make us glad for the days you have humbled us, for the evil years we have seen.
019	PSA	090	016	Let your servants see you in action, show your majesty to their children.
019	PSA	090	017	Let the grace of the Lord our God be upon us, uphold what our hands are striving to do.
019	PSA	091	001	You whose home is the shelter of God Most High, whose abode is the shadow of God Almighty,
019	PSA	091	002	can say to the Lord, ‘My refuge, my fortress, my God, in whom I trust.’
019	PSA	091	003	For he saves you from fowler’s snare, from deadly plague,
019	PSA	091	004	he shelters you with his pinions, and under his wings you can hide. His truth will be a shield and buckler.
019	PSA	091	005	You need not fear the terror of night, nor the arrow that flies by day,
019	PSA	091	006	nor the plague that stalks in darkness, nor the pestilence raging at noon.
019	PSA	091	007	A thousand may fall at your side, ten thousand at your right hand: but it will not draw near to you.
019	PSA	091	008	You will only look on with your eyes, and see how the wicked are punished.
019	PSA	091	009	You have made the Lord your refuge, you have made the Most High your defence.
019	PSA	091	010	You will never be met by misfortune, no plague will come near your tent,
019	PSA	091	011	for he orders his angels to guard you, wherever you go.
019	PSA	091	012	They will carry you with their hands, so you don’t hurt your foot on a stone.
019	PSA	091	013	You will trample down lions and snakes, tread on young lions and cobras.
019	PSA	091	014	‘Because of their love for me, I will deliver them, I will protect those who trust my name.
019	PSA	091	015	I will answer their cry and be with them in trouble, bringing them forth into safety and honour.
019	PSA	091	016	I will give them a life of many days, I will show them my salvation.’
019	PSA	092	001	A psalm. A song; for the sabbath day. It is good to give thanks to the Lord, to sing praise to your name, O Most High,
019	PSA	092	002	to declare your love in the morning, and your faithfulness in the night,
019	PSA	092	003	with voice and a ten-stringed harp, with music that throbs on the lyre.
019	PSA	092	004	For you make me glad by your deeds, Lord, at the work of your hands I will ring out my joy.
019	PSA	092	005	How great are your works, O Lord; how deep are your thoughts!
019	PSA	092	006	The insensitive cannot know, nor can a fool understand,
019	PSA	092	007	that, though the wicked flourish like grass, and evildoers all blossom, they will perish forever.
019	PSA	092	008	But you are exalted forever.
019	PSA	092	009	For see! Your enemies, Lord For see! Your enemies perish, all evildoers are scattered.
019	PSA	092	010	But you lift me to honour, and anoint me afresh with oil.
019	PSA	092	011	My eyes will feast on my foes, and my ears will hear of the doom of the wicked.
019	PSA	092	012	The righteous will sprout like the palm, will grow like a cedar of Lebanon.
019	PSA	092	013	In the house of the Lord are they planted, in the courts of our God they will sprout.
019	PSA	092	014	They will still bear fruit in old age, all sappy and fresh will they be
019	PSA	092	015	So they proclaim the Lord to be just, my rock, in whom is no wrong.
019	PSA	093	001	The Lord has taken his seat on the throne, clothed with majesty, armed with might. Now the world stands firm, to be shaken no more,
019	PSA	093	002	firm stands your throne from all eternity. You are from everlasting.
019	PSA	093	003	The floods, O Lord, have lifted, the floods have lifted their voice, the floods lift up their roar.
019	PSA	093	004	But more grand than the great roaring waters, more grand than the ocean waves, grand on the height stands the Lord.
019	PSA	093	005	What you have ordained is most sure; most sure shall your house stand inviolate, O Lord, for ever and ever.
019	PSA	094	001	Lord, God of vengeance, God of vengeance, shine forth.
019	PSA	094	002	Rise up, judge of the earth, pay back the proud what they deserve.
019	PSA	094	003	Lord, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked exult,
019	PSA	094	004	with their blustering arrogant words, their braggart and wicked speech,
019	PSA	094	005	crushing your people, Lord, and afflicting your heritage,
019	PSA	094	006	murdering widows and strangers, slaying the fatherless?
019	PSA	094	007	They think that the Lord does not see, nor the God of Jacob regard it.
019	PSA	094	008	Take heed, you dullest of people; when will you be wise, you fools?
019	PSA	094	009	Is he deaf, who shaped the ear? Is he blind, who fashioned the eye?
019	PSA	094	010	Can he who trains nations not punish them he who teaches knowledge to people?
019	PSA	094	011	The Lord knows the thoughts of people, that only a breath are they.
019	PSA	094	012	Happy are those whom you chasten, and teach out of your law,
019	PSA	094	013	keeping them calm in the day of misfortune, till a pit be dug for the wicked.
019	PSA	094	014	For the Lord will not leave his people, he will not forsake his inheritance.
019	PSA	094	015	For the righteous shall come to their rights, and all true-hearted people shall follow them.
019	PSA	094	016	Who will rise up for me against those who do evil? Who will stand up for me against workers of wrong?
019	PSA	094	017	Were it not for the help of the Lord, I would soon have gone to the silent grave.
019	PSA	094	018	When I thought that my foot was slipping, your kindness, Lord, held me up.
019	PSA	094	019	When with cares my heart was crowded, your comforts make me glad.
019	PSA	094	020	Can corrupt justice be your ally, framing mischief by statute?
019	PSA	094	021	They assail the life of the righteous, and innocent blood condemn.
019	PSA	094	022	But the Lord is my sure retreat, my God is the rock of my refuge.
019	PSA	094	023	He will bring back their sin upon them, for their wickedness he will destroy them; the Lord our God will destroy them.
019	PSA	095	001	Come! Let us ring out our joy to the Lord, let us merrily shout to our rock of salvation.
019	PSA	095	002	Before his face let us come with thanks, with songs of praise let us shout to him.
019	PSA	095	003	For the Lord is a great God, king above all gods.
019	PSA	095	004	In his hand are the depths of the earth, the heights of the mountains are his.
019	PSA	095	005	The sea is his, for he made it: the dry land was formed by his hands.
019	PSA	095	006	Come! Let us worship and bow on our knees to the Lord our creator.
019	PSA	095	007	For he is our God; and we are the people he tends, the sheep in his care. If only you would heed his voice today:
019	PSA	095	008	‘Do not harden your hearts as at Meribah, or at Massah, that day in the desert,
019	PSA	095	009	when your ancestors tempted and tried me, though they had seen my deeds.
019	PSA	095	010	‘For forty years I was filled with loathing for that generation, so I said: “A people with wandering hearts are they, and ignorant of my ways.”
019	PSA	095	011	So I solemnly swore to them in my anger, that never would they enter my place of rest.’
019	PSA	096	001	Sing to the Lord a new song, sing to the Lord, all the earth.
019	PSA	096	002	Sing to the Lord, bless his name, from day to day herald his victory.
019	PSA	096	003	Tell his glory among the nations, his wonders among all peoples.
019	PSA	096	004	For great is the Lord and worthy all praise; held in awe, above all gods:
019	PSA	096	005	for all the gods of the nations are idols, but the Lord created the heavens.
019	PSA	096	006	Before him are splendour and majesty, beauty and strength in his holy place.
019	PSA	096	007	Ascribe to the Lord, you tribes of the nations, ascribe to the Lord glory and strength.
019	PSA	096	008	Ascribe to the Lord the glory he manifests: bring you an offering, enter his courts.
019	PSA	096	009	Bow to the Lord in holy array: tremble before him, all the earth.
019	PSA	096	010	Say to the nations, ‘The Lord is king.’ The world stands firm to be shaken no more. He will judge the peoples with equity.
019	PSA	096	011	Let the heavens be glad and the earth rejoice, let the sea and its fulness thunder.
019	PSA	096	012	Let the field, and all that is in it, exult; let the trees of the forest ring out their joy
019	PSA	096	013	before the Lord: for he comes, he comes to judge the earth. He will judge the world with justice and the nations with faithfulness.
019	PSA	097	001	The Lord is king, let the earth rejoice: let her many isles be glad.
019	PSA	097	002	Clouds and darkness are round about him, justice and right are the base of his throne.
019	PSA	097	003	Fire goes before him, and blazes around his steps,
019	PSA	097	004	his lightnings illumine the world: the earth quakes at the sight.
019	PSA	097	005	Mountains melt like wax before the Lord of all the earth.
019	PSA	097	006	The heavens proclaim his justice, all nations behold his glory.
019	PSA	097	007	Shamed are all image-worshippers, who make a boast of their idols. All the gods bow before him.
019	PSA	097	008	Zion is glad at the tidings, the towns of Judah rejoice because of your judgments, Lord.
019	PSA	097	009	For you are most high over all the earth, greatly exalted above all gods.
019	PSA	097	010	The Lord loves those who hate evil, he guards the lives of the faithful: from the hand of the wicked he saves them.
019	PSA	097	011	Light arises for the righteous, and joy for the upright in heart.
019	PSA	097	012	Rejoice in the Lord, you righteous: give thanks to his holy name.
019	PSA	098	001	A psalm. Sing a new song to the Lord, for he has done wonders; his right hand and holy arm have won him the victory.
019	PSA	098	002	The Lord has made his victory known, and revealed to the eyes of the nations his righteousness.
019	PSA	098	003	Mindful he was of his kindness to Jacob, faithful he was to the house of Israel. All the ends of the earth have seen the victory of our God.
019	PSA	098	004	Shout, all the earth, to the Lord: break into cries and music.
019	PSA	098	005	Play on the lyre to the Lord, on the lyre and with loud melody.
019	PSA	098	006	With trumpet and sound of horn, shout before the king.
019	PSA	098	007	Let the sea and its fulness roar, the world and the dwellers upon it.
019	PSA	098	008	Let the streams clap their hands, let the hills shout for gladness together
019	PSA	098	009	before the Lord for he comes, he comes to judge the earth. He will judge the world with justice and the nations with equity.
019	PSA	099	001	The Lord is king; let the nations tremble: he is throned upon cherubs; let earth quake.
019	PSA	099	002	The Lord is great in Zion, he is high over all the nations.
019	PSA	099	003	Let them praise your great and terrible name. Holy is he.
019	PSA	099	004	You are a king who loves justice, equity you have established: justice and right you have wrought for Jacob.
019	PSA	099	005	Exalt the Lord our God, bow down at his footstool. Holy is he.
019	PSA	099	006	Among his priests were Moses and Aaron, Samuel among those who called on his name. They called to the Lord, and he gave them answer.
019	PSA	099	007	He spoke to them in the pillar of cloud, they kept his commands and the statute he gave them.
019	PSA	099	008	Lord our God, you gave them answer. A God of forgiveness were you to them, who suffered their deeds to go unpunished.
019	PSA	099	009	Exalt the Lord our God; bow down at his holy mountain. For holy is the Lord our God.
019	PSA	100	001	A psalm of praise. Shout, all the earth, to the Lord.
019	PSA	100	002	Serve the Lord with gladness, approach him with ringing cries.
019	PSA	100	003	Be sure that the Lord alone is God. It is he who has made us, and his we are his people, the sheep of his pasture.
019	PSA	100	004	Enter his gates with thanksgiving, his courts with praise. Give thanks to him, bless his name.
019	PSA	100	005	For the Lord is good, his love is forever, and to all ages endures his faithfulness.
019	PSA	101	001	Of David, a psalm. If kindness and justice I sing, making melody to you, Lord.
019	PSA	101	002	I would look to the way that is blameless, and make it my own. Within my own house I would walk with an innocent heart.
019	PSA	101	003	I would never direct my eyes to a thing that is base. The impulse to stray I abhor it shall not cling to me.
019	PSA	101	004	Far from me be perverseness of heart, or kinship with evil.
019	PSA	101	005	Who slanders their neighbour in secret, I bring them to silence: haughty looks and proud hearts I will not abide.
019	PSA	101	006	I will favour the true in the land, they shall live in my court. Those who walk in a way that is blameless will be my attendant.
019	PSA	101	007	No one will live in my house who practises guile. No one that speaks a lie will abide in my presence.
019	PSA	101	008	Morn by morn I will wholly wipe out all the bad in the land, and cut off from the Lord’s own city all workers of evil.
019	PSA	102	001	The prayer: for a weary and suffering person who pours out their grief to the Lord. Hear my prayer, O Lord; let my cry for help come to you.
019	PSA	102	002	Hide not your face from me in the day of my distress. Incline your ear to me: when I call, answer me speedily.
019	PSA	102	003	For my days pass away like smoke: my bones are burned through as with fire.
019	PSA	102	004	My heart is scorched, withered like grass; I forget to eat my bread.
019	PSA	102	005	By reason of my loud groaning, my flesh clings to my bones.
019	PSA	102	006	Like a desert-owl of the wilderness, like an owl among ruins am I.
019	PSA	102	007	I make my sleepless lament like a bird on the house-top alone.
019	PSA	102	008	All the day wild foes revile me, using my name for a curse.
019	PSA	102	009	For ashes have been my bread, and tears have been mixed with my cup.
019	PSA	102	010	Because of your passionate anger, you did raise me, then hurl me to the ground.
019	PSA	102	011	My days come to an end, shadows lengthen, I wither like grass.
019	PSA	102	012	But you, O Lord, are enthroned forever, your fame endures to all generations.
019	PSA	102	013	You will arise and have pity on Zion; it’s time to be gracious; her hour has come.
019	PSA	102	014	For even her stones are dear to your servants, even the dust of her ruins they look on with love.
019	PSA	102	015	Then the nations will revere the name of the Lord and all the kings of the earth his glory,
019	PSA	102	016	when the Lord shall have built up Zion, and revealed himself in his glory,
019	PSA	102	017	in response to the prayer of the destitute, whose prayer he will not despise.
019	PSA	102	018	Let this be recorded for ages to come, that the Lord may be praised by a people yet unborn.
019	PSA	102	019	For he shall look down from his holy height, from the heavens the Lord will gaze on the earth,
019	PSA	102	020	to hear the groans of the prisoner, to free those who are doomed to die;
019	PSA	102	021	that people may recount the Lord’s fame in Zion, and the praise of him in Jerusalem,
019	PSA	102	022	when the nations are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to worship the Lord.
019	PSA	102	023	He has broken my strength on the way, he has shortened my days.
019	PSA	102	024	I will say, ‘My God, take me not hence in the midst of my days. ‘Your years endure age after age.
019	PSA	102	025	Of old you have founded the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands.
019	PSA	102	026	They shall perish; but you do stand. They shall all wax old like a garment, and change as a robe you will change them.
019	PSA	102	027	But you are the same, your years are endless.
019	PSA	102	028	The children of your servants abide, evermore shall their seed be before you.’
019	PSA	103	001	Of David. O my soul, bless the Lord; and all that is in me, his holy name.
019	PSA	103	002	O my soul, bless the Lord; and forget not one of his benefits.
019	PSA	103	003	He pardons all your sins, he heals all your diseases.
019	PSA	103	004	He ransoms your life from the pit, he crowns you with kindness and pity.
019	PSA	103	005	He gives you your heart’s desire, renewing your youth like the eagle’s.
019	PSA	103	006	The Lord executes justice – and right for all who are wronged.
019	PSA	103	007	He revealed his ways to Moses, his acts to the children of Israel.
019	PSA	103	008	Full of pity and grace is the Lord, patient, and rich in kindness:
019	PSA	103	009	he will not always chide, nor cherish his anger forever.
019	PSA	103	010	Not after our sins has he dealt with us, nor requited us after our wickedness.
019	PSA	103	011	For high as the heavens o’er the earth is his love over those who fear him.
019	PSA	103	012	Far as is east from the west has he put our transgressions from us.
019	PSA	103	013	As a father pities his children, so the Lord pities those who fear him;
019	PSA	103	014	for well he knows our frame, he remembers that we are dust.
019	PSA	103	015	A person’s days are as grass; blossoms like a flower of the meadow.
019	PSA	103	016	At the breath of the wind it is gone, and the place thereof knows it no more.
019	PSA	103	017	But the love of the Lord is eternal, and his kindness to children’s children,
019	PSA	103	018	to those who keep his covenant and mindfully do his behests.
019	PSA	103	019	The Lord has set his throne in the heavens; the whole world is under his sway.
019	PSA	103	020	Bless the Lord, you angels of his, mighty heroes performing his word.
019	PSA	103	021	Bless the Lord, all you his hosts, you servants who do his will.
019	PSA	103	022	Bless the Lord, all you his works, far as his sway extends. O my soul, bless the Lord.
019	PSA	104	001	Bless the Lord, O my soul. O Lord my God, you are very great, clad in awful splendour,
019	PSA	104	002	covered with robe of light. You stretch out the heavens like the cloth of a tent.
019	PSA	104	003	He lays the beams of his chambers on water. He takes dark clouds for his chariot, and rides on the wings of the wind.
019	PSA	104	004	He takes the winds for his messengers, the fire and the flame for his servants.
019	PSA	104	005	He founded the earth upon pillars, to sustain it unshaken forever.
019	PSA	104	006	With the garment of ocean he covered it, waters towered over the mountains.
019	PSA	104	007	But at your rebuke they fled, scared by the roar of your thunder,
019	PSA	104	008	mountains rose, valleys sank down to the place appointed for them.
019	PSA	104	009	They dared not pass the bounds set for them, or cover the earth any more.
019	PSA	104	010	He sent brooks into the valleys, they meander between the mountains.
019	PSA	104	011	The wild beasts all drink from them, and the wild asses quench their thirst.
019	PSA	104	012	The birds have their home by the banks, and sing in the branches.
019	PSA	104	013	From his chambers above he gives drink to the mountains, and satisfies earth with the vials of heaven.
019	PSA	104	014	He makes grass grow for the cattle, and herbs for people. He brings bread out of the earth;
019	PSA	104	015	wine, to gladden hearts; oil, to make faces shine; bread, to strengthen hearts.
019	PSA	104	016	The trees of the Lord drink their fill the cedars he planted on Lebanon,
019	PSA	104	017	where the little birds build their nest, and the stork whose home is the cypress.
019	PSA	104	018	The high hills are for the wild goats, and the rocks are for coneys to hide in.
019	PSA	104	019	He created the moon to mark seasons, and told the sun when to set.
019	PSA	104	020	You make it dark: night comes, when all the wild beasts creep out.
019	PSA	104	021	Young lions that roar for their prey, seeking their meat from God.
019	PSA	104	022	At sunrise they slink away, and lie down in their dens.
019	PSA	104	023	Then people go forth to their work, and toil till evening.
019	PSA	104	024	How many, O Lord, are your works, all of them made in wisdom! The earth is filled with your creatures.
019	PSA	104	025	And there is the great broad sea, where are countless things in motion, living creatures, both great and small.
019	PSA	104	026	There go the ships, and the Leviathan you made to play there.
019	PSA	104	027	They all look in hope to you, to give them their food in due season.
019	PSA	104	028	And you give with open hand; they gather and eat to their heart’s desire.
019	PSA	104	029	When you hide your face, they are terrified; when you take their breath away, they die and go back to their dust.
019	PSA	104	030	But a breath from your lips creates them, and renews the face of the earth.
019	PSA	104	031	May the glory of the Lord be forever, may the Lord rejoice in his works.
019	PSA	104	032	A glance of his makes the earth tremble, a touch of his makes the hills smoke.
019	PSA	104	033	I will sing to the Lord while I live, I will play to my God while I am.
019	PSA	104	034	May my musing be sweet to him, for I rejoice in the Lord.
019	PSA	104	035	But may sinners be swept from the earth, and the wicked vanish forever. O my soul, bless the Lord. Hallelujah.
019	PSA	105	001	Give thanks to the Lord, call on his name: make known his deeds among the nations.
019	PSA	105	002	Sing to him, make music to him, tell of all his wondrous works.
019	PSA	105	003	Make your boast in his holy name, be glad at heart, you who seek the Lord.
019	PSA	105	004	Seek after the Lord and his strength, seek his face evermore.
019	PSA	105	005	Remember the wonders he did, his portents, the judgments he uttered,
019	PSA	105	006	you who are offspring of Abraham, his servant, the children of Jacob, his chosen ones.
019	PSA	105	007	He is the Lord our God: in all the earth are his judgments.
019	PSA	105	008	He remembers forever his covenant, his promise for a thousand generations
019	PSA	105	009	The covenant he made with Abraham, the oath he swore to Isaac,
019	PSA	105	010	and confirmed as a statute to Jacob, a pact everlasting to Israel
019	PSA	105	011	to give them the land of Canaan as the lot which they should inherit.
019	PSA	105	012	And when they were very few, few and but pilgrims therein,
019	PSA	105	013	wandering from nation to nation, journeying from people to people,
019	PSA	105	014	he allowed no one to oppress them, even punishing kings for their sakes.
019	PSA	105	015	He forbade them to touch his anointed, or do any hurt to his prophets.
019	PSA	105	016	When he called down famine on the land, and cut off the bread which sustained them,
019	PSA	105	017	he sent before them a man, Joseph, who was sold as a slave.
019	PSA	105	018	His feet were galled with fetters, he was laid in chains of iron,
019	PSA	105	019	till the time that his word came to pass, the word of the Lord that had tried him.
019	PSA	105	020	The king sent and freed him, the ruler of nations released him.
019	PSA	105	021	He made him lord of his household, and ruler of all his possessions,
019	PSA	105	022	to admonish his princes at will and instruct his elders in wisdom.
019	PSA	105	023	Thus Israel came into Egypt, Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.
019	PSA	105	024	His people he made very fruitful, and mightier than their foes.
019	PSA	105	025	He inspired them to hate his people, and to deal with his servants craftily.
019	PSA	105	026	He sent his servant Moses, and Aaron whom he had chosen,
019	PSA	105	027	portents he wrought in Egypt, and signs in the land of Ham.
019	PSA	105	028	Darkness he sent, and it fell: yet they gave no heed to his word.
019	PSA	105	029	He turned their waters into blood, thus causing their fish to die.
019	PSA	105	030	Their land was alive with frogs, swarming even in the royal chambers.
019	PSA	105	031	At his command came flies, and lice in all their borders.
019	PSA	105	032	He gave them hail for rain and fire that flashed through the land,
019	PSA	105	033	smiting their vines and figs, breaking the trees of their border.
019	PSA	105	034	At his command came locusts, young locusts beyond all counting,
019	PSA	105	035	which ate every herb in the land, ate up, too, the fruit of their ground.
019	PSA	105	036	He struck down in their land all the firstborn, the firstlings of all their strength
019	PSA	105	037	Then forth he led Israel with silver and gold, and among his tribes no one was weary.
019	PSA	105	038	Egypt was glad when they left, for terror had fallen upon them.
019	PSA	105	039	He spread out a cloud to screen them, and fire to give light in the night.
019	PSA	105	040	He sent quails at their entreaty, and heavenly bread in abundance.
019	PSA	105	041	He opened the rock; waters gushed: in the desert they ran like a river.
019	PSA	105	042	For he remembered his holy promise to Abraham his servant.
019	PSA	105	043	So he led out his people with joy, his elect with a ringing cry.
019	PSA	105	044	And he gave them the lands of the nations, the fruit of their toil for possession,
019	PSA	105	045	that so they might keep his statutes, and be of his laws observant. Hallelujah.
019	PSA	106	001	Hallelujah! Give thanks to the Lord for his goodness, for his kindness endures forever.
019	PSA	106	002	Who can describe his heroic deeds, or publish all his praise?
019	PSA	106	003	Happy they who act justly, and do righteousness evermore.
019	PSA	106	004	Remember me, Lord, as you remember your people, and visit me with your gracious help.
019	PSA	106	005	May I see the good fortune of your elect, may I share in the joy of your nation, and in the pride of your heritage.
019	PSA	106	006	We, like our fathers, have sinned, we have done perversely and wickedly
019	PSA	106	007	In the land of Egypt our fathers, all heedless of your wonders, and unmindful of your great kindness, at the Red Sea defied the Most High.
019	PSA	106	008	But true to his name he saved them, in order to show his might.
019	PSA	106	009	He rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried; they marched through the depths as through desert,
019	PSA	106	010	saved from the hand of the hostile, redeemed from the hand of the foe.
019	PSA	106	011	The waters covered their enemies: not one of them was left.
019	PSA	106	012	So then they believed in his words, and began to sing his praise.
019	PSA	106	013	But soon they forgot his deeds: they did not wait for his counsel.
019	PSA	106	014	Their greed was ravenous in the desert; they put God to the test in the wilderness.
019	PSA	106	015	He gave them the thing they had asked for, but sent wasting disease among them.
019	PSA	106	016	The camp grew jealous of Moses and of Aaron, holy one of the Lord.
019	PSA	106	017	The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered Abiram’s company.
019	PSA	106	018	Fire broke out on their company, flame kindled upon the wicked.
019	PSA	106	019	They made a calf in Horeb, and bowed to the molten image.
019	PSA	106	020	They exchanged their glorious God for the image of ox that eats grass.
019	PSA	106	021	They forgot the God who had saved them by mighty deeds in Egypt
019	PSA	106	022	Wonders in the land of Ham, terrors by the Red Sea.
019	PSA	106	023	So he vowed, and would have destroyed them, but for Moses his elect, who stepped into the breach before him, to divert his deadly wrath.
019	PSA	106	024	They spurned the delightsome land, they refused to believe in his word.
019	PSA	106	025	They grumbled in their tents, would not listen to the voice of the Lord.
019	PSA	106	026	So he swore with uplifted hand to lay them low in the wilderness;
019	PSA	106	027	to disperse their seed among heathen, to scatter them over the world.
019	PSA	106	028	Then they joined them to Baal of Peor, and ate what was offered the dead.
019	PSA	106	029	They provoked him to wrath by their deeds, and plague broke out among them.
019	PSA	106	030	Then Phinehas stood between, and so the plague was stayed;
019	PSA	106	031	and it was counted to him for righteousness unto all generations forever.
019	PSA	106	032	They angered him at the waters of Meribah, through them it went ill with Moses.
019	PSA	106	033	They rebelled against his spirit, and he uttered speech that was rash.
019	PSA	106	034	They did not destroy the nations, as the Lord had commanded them;
019	PSA	106	035	but they mingled with the heathen, and learned to do as they did.
019	PSA	106	036	Their idol gods they worshipped, and they were ensnared by them.
019	PSA	106	037	They sacrificed their sons and their daughters to the demons.
019	PSA	106	038	They poured out innocent blood the blood of their sons and daughters whom they offered to Canaan’s idols, and the land was polluted with blood.
019	PSA	106	039	They became unclean by their works, and adulterous in their deeds.
019	PSA	106	040	Then the Lord’s fury was on his people, filled with horror at his inheritance.
019	PSA	106	041	He delivered them to the heathen, to the sway of those who hated them.
019	PSA	106	042	Their enemies oppressed them, and subdued them under their hand.
019	PSA	106	043	Many a time he saved them, but they rebelled at his counsel, and were brought low by their wrongdoing.
019	PSA	106	044	Yet he looked upon their distress, when he heard their cry.
019	PSA	106	045	He remembered his covenant, and, in his great kindness, relented.
019	PSA	106	046	He caused them to be pitied by all who carried them captive.
019	PSA	106	047	Save us, O Lord our God, and gather us out of the nations, to give thanks to your holy name, and to make our boast of your praise.
019	PSA	106	048	Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting. And let all the people say ‘Amen.’ Praise the Lord.
019	PSA	107	001	Give thanks to the Lord for his goodness for his kindness endures forever.
019	PSA	107	002	Let this be the song of the ransomed, whom the Lord has redeemed from distress,
019	PSA	107	003	gathering them from all lands, east, west, north, and south.
019	PSA	107	004	In the wastes of the desert some wandered, finding no way to a city inhabited.
019	PSA	107	005	Full of hunger and thirst, their spirit failed.
019	PSA	107	006	Then they cried to the Lord in their trouble, and he saved them from their distresses,
019	PSA	107	007	guiding them straight on the way, till they reached an inhabited city.
019	PSA	107	008	Let them thank the Lord for his kindness, for his wonderful deeds for people;
019	PSA	107	009	for the thirsty he satisfies, and the hungry he fills with good things.
019	PSA	107	010	Some sat in darkness and gloom prisoners in irons and misery,
019	PSA	107	011	for rebelling against God’s word, and spurning the Most High’s counsel.
019	PSA	107	012	Their heart was bowed with toil; there was no one to help when they stumbled.
019	PSA	107	013	Then they cried to the Lord in their trouble, and he saved them from their distresses.
019	PSA	107	014	Out of darkness and gloom he brought them, and burst their chains.
019	PSA	107	015	Let them praise the Lord for his kindness, for his wonderful deeds for people.
019	PSA	107	016	For he shattered the gates of bronze, and broke bars of iron.
019	PSA	107	017	Some were sick from their wicked ways, and suffering because of their sins.
019	PSA	107	018	All manner of food they hated; they had come to the gates of death.
019	PSA	107	019	Then they cried to the Lord in their trouble, and he saved them from their distresses.
019	PSA	107	020	He sent his word and healed them, and delivered their life from the pit.
019	PSA	107	021	Let them praise the Lord for his kindness, for his wonderful deeds for people.
019	PSA	107	022	Let them offer to him thankofferings, and with joy tell what things he has done.
019	PSA	107	023	Some crossed the sea in ships, doing business in great waters.
019	PSA	107	024	They have seen what the Lord can do, and his wonderful deeds on the deep.
019	PSA	107	025	At his command rose a tempest, which lifted the waves on high.
019	PSA	107	026	Up to heaven they went, down to the depths; their courage failed them.
019	PSA	107	027	They staggered and reeled like drunkards; all their skills useless.
019	PSA	107	028	Then they cried to the Lord in their trouble, and he saved them from their distresses.
019	PSA	107	029	He stilled the storm to a whisper, and the waves of the sea were hushed.
019	PSA	107	030	They were glad, because it was quiet; they were led to the haven they longed for.
019	PSA	107	031	Let them praise the Lord, for his kindness, for his wonderful deeds for people.
019	PSA	107	032	Where the people assemble, extol him, and praise him in council of elders.
019	PSA	107	033	He turns streams into a wilderness, springs of water into thirsty land,
019	PSA	107	034	fruitful land into a salt waste, because of the sin of the people.
019	PSA	107	035	A desert he makes pools of water, a land of drought into springs of water.
019	PSA	107	036	He settles the hungry therein, they establish a city to live in.
019	PSA	107	037	They sow fields and plant vineyards, which furnish a fruitful yield.
019	PSA	107	038	By his blessing they multiply greatly, and he lets not their cattle decrease.
019	PSA	107	039	Yet when they are bowed and diminished by oppression, misfortune, or sorrow,
019	PSA	107	040	he pours contempt upon princes, and on trackless wastes leads them astray
019	PSA	107	041	He lifts the poor out of misery, and makes families fruitful as flocks.
019	PSA	107	042	At this sight shall the upright be glad, and all wicked mouths shall be stopped.
019	PSA	107	043	Let those who are wise observe this, and consider the love of the Lord
019	PSA	108	001	A song. A psalm of David. My heart is steadfast, O God, my heart is steadfast. I would sing, I would make music; awake, my soul.
019	PSA	108	002	Awake, harp and lyre; I would wake the dawn.
019	PSA	108	003	I would praise you among the peoples, O Lord; make music among the nations to you.

019	PSA	108	005	Be exalted, O God, o’er the heavens, and your glory o’er all the earth.

019	PSA	108	013	With God we shall yet do bravely, he himself will tread down our foes.
019	PSA	109	001	For the leader. Of David, a psalm. O God whom I praise, keep not silence;
019	PSA	109	002	for their wicked mouths they have opened against me, they speak to me with tongues that are false,
019	PSA	109	003	they beset me with words of hatred, and fight without cause against me.
019	PSA	109	004	My love they requite with hostility, while for them I lift up my prayer.
019	PSA	109	005	Evil for good they reward me, and hatred for my love.

019	PSA	109	014	May his father’s guilt be remembered, and his mother’s sin not blotted out:
019	PSA	109	015	on record always before the Lord, and his memory root from the earth;
019	PSA	109	016	for he gave no thought to show kindness, but pursued the poor and the needy, drove the downhearted to death.
019	PSA	109	017	‘May the curses he loved light upon him, may the blessings he loathed be afar.
019	PSA	109	018	Like a garment he clothed him with curses; may they pierce to his inwards like water, and cling to his bones like oil.
019	PSA	109	019	Let them be like the robe he wraps round him, like the belt he wears every day.’
019	PSA	109	020	Be this the reward of my adversaries, of those who speak evil against me.
019	PSA	109	021	But you, Lord my God, be true to your name, deal kindly with me; in your gracious kindness save me.
019	PSA	109	022	For I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.
019	PSA	109	023	I am gone like a lengthening shadow, I am shaken off like a locust.
019	PSA	109	024	My knees totter from fasting, my flesh is shrivelled and spare.
019	PSA	109	025	They heap insults upon me: when they see me, they shake their head.

019	PSA	109	030	I give thanks to you, Lord, with loud voice, I give praise in the midst of the throng;

019	PSA	111	003	Majestic and glorious is his work, and his righteousness abides forever.
019	PSA	111	004	For his marvellous deeds he has won renown; the Lord is gracious and full of compassion.
019	PSA	111	005	Food he gives to those who fear him, always he remembers his covenant.
019	PSA	111	006	His mighty works he has shown to his people, in giving to them the nations for heritage.
019	PSA	111	007	All that he does is faithful and right, all his behests are firm and sure.
019	PSA	111	008	They are established for ever and ever, executed with truth and uprightness.

019	PSA	112	004	To the upright arises light in the darkness; full of favour and pity and kindness are they.
019	PSA	112	005	It is well with those who show pity and lend, who support all their affairs upon justice.
019	PSA	112	006	For they will never be shaken; the just will be forever remembered.
019	PSA	112	007	They will not be afraid of evil tidings, with steady heart they trust the Lord.

019	PSA	116	011	though in my alarm I said, ‘Everyone is a liar.’
019	PSA	116	012	What shall I render the Lord for all his bounty to me?
019	PSA	116	013	I will lift up the cup of salvation, and call on the name of the Lord.
019	PSA	116	014	I will pay my vows to the Lord in the presence of all his people.

019	PSA	118	007	The Lord is mine, as my help: I shall feast my eyes on my foes.
019	PSA	118	008	It is better to hide in the Lord than to trust in mortals.
019	PSA	118	009	It is better to hide in the Lord than to put any trust in princes.
019	PSA	118	010	Everywhere heathen swarmed round me; in the name of the Lord I cut them down.
019	PSA	118	011	They swarmed, swarmed around me; in the name of the Lord I cut them down,
019	PSA	118	012	they swarmed around me like bees, they blazed like a fire of thorns: in the name of the Lord I cut them down.
019	PSA	118	013	Sore they pushed me, to make me fall; but the Lord gave me his help.

019	PSA	118	017	I shall not die: nay, I shall live, to declare the works of the Lord.
019	PSA	118	018	Though the Lord has chastened me sore, he has not given me over to death. (The Procession arrives at the Temple)

019	PSA	119	084	How few are the days of your servant! When will you judge those who harass me?
019	PSA	119	085	Proud people have dug for me pits people who do not conform to your law.
019	PSA	119	086	All your commandments are trusty. With falsehood they harass me: help me.
019	PSA	119	087	They had nearly made an end of me, yet I did not forget your precepts.
019	PSA	119	088	Spare me in your kindness, and I will observe the charge of your mouth.
019	PSA	119	089	Forever, O Lord, is your word fixed firmly in the heavens.
019	PSA	119	090	Your truth endures age after age; it is established on earth, and it stands.
019	PSA	119	091	By your appointment they stand this day, for all are your servants.
019	PSA	119	092	Had not your law been my joy, in my misery then had I perished.
019	PSA	119	093	I will never forget your precepts, for through them you have put life in me.
019	PSA	119	094	I am yours, O save me, for I give my mind to your precepts.
019	PSA	119	095	The wicked lay wait to destroy me, but I give heed to your charge.
019	PSA	119	096	I have seen a limit to all things: but your commandment is spacious exceedingly.
019	PSA	119	097	O how I love your law! All the day long I muse on it.
019	PSA	119	098	Your commandment makes me wiser than my enemies: for it is mine forever.
019	PSA	119	099	I am prudent above all my teachers, for your charges are my (meditation)
019	PSA	119	100	I have insight more than the aged, because I observe your precepts.
019	PSA	119	101	I refrain my foot from all wicked ways, that I may keep your word.
019	PSA	119	102	I turn not aside from your judgments, for you yourself are my teacher.
019	PSA	119	103	How sweet are your words to my taste, sweeter than honey to my mouth!
019	PSA	119	104	Insight I win through your precepts, therefore every false way I hate.
019	PSA	119	105	Your word is a lamp to my feet, and a light to my path.
019	PSA	119	106	I have sworn an oath, and will keep it, to observe your righteous judgments.
019	PSA	119	107	I am afflicted sorely: revive me, O Lord, as you said.
019	PSA	119	108	Accept, Lord, my willing praise, and teach me your judgments.
019	PSA	119	109	My life is in ceaseless peril; but I do not forget your law.
019	PSA	119	110	The wicked set traps for me, yet I do not stray from your precepts.
019	PSA	119	111	In your charges are my everlasting inheritance, they are the joy of my heart.
019	PSA	119	112	I am resolved to perform your statutes forever, to the utmost.
019	PSA	119	113	I hate people of divided heart, but your law do I love.
019	PSA	119	114	You are my shelter and shield: in your word do I hope.
019	PSA	119	115	Begone, you wicked people, I will keep the commands of my God.
019	PSA	119	116	Uphold me and spare me, as you have promised: O disappoint me not.
019	PSA	119	117	Hold me up, and I shall be saved: and your statutes shall be my unceasing delight.
019	PSA	119	118	All who swerve from your statutes you spurn: their cunning is in vain.
019	PSA	119	119	All the wicked of earth you count as dross, therefore I love your charges.
019	PSA	119	120	My flesh, for fear of you, shudders, and I stand in awe of your judgments.
019	PSA	119	121	Justice and right have I practised, do not leave me to my oppressors.
019	PSA	119	122	Be your servant’s surety for good, let not the proud oppress me.
019	PSA	119	123	My eyes pine for your salvation, and for your righteous promise.
019	PSA	119	124	Deal in your love with your servant, and teach me your statutes.
019	PSA	119	125	Your servant am I; instruct me, that I may know your charges.
019	PSA	119	126	It is time for the Lord to act: they have violated your law.
019	PSA	119	127	Therefore I love your commandments above gold, above fine gold.
019	PSA	119	128	So by all your precepts I guide me, and every false way I hate.
019	PSA	119	129	Your decrees are wonderful, gladly I keep them.
019	PSA	119	130	When your word is unfolded, light breaks; it imparts to the simple wisdom.
019	PSA	119	131	With open mouth I pant with longing for your commandments.
019	PSA	119	132	Turn to me with your favour, as is just to those who love you.

019	PSA	119	135	Shine with your face on your servant, and teach me your statutes.
019	PSA	119	136	My eyes run down with rills of water, because your law is not kept.
019	PSA	119	137	Righteous are you, O Lord, and right are your ordinances.
019	PSA	119	138	The laws you has ordered are just, and trusty exceedingly.
019	PSA	119	139	My jealousy has undone me, that my foes have forgotten your words.
019	PSA	119	140	Your word has been tested well; and your servant loves it.
019	PSA	119	141	I am little and held in contempt, but your precepts I have not forgotten.

019	PSA	119	146	I cry to you: O save me, and I will observe your charges.
019	PSA	119	147	Before dawn I cry for your help: in your word do I hope.
019	PSA	119	148	Awake I meet the night-watches, to muse upon your sayings.
019	PSA	119	149	Hear my voice in your kindness: O Lord, by your judgments revive me.
019	PSA	119	150	Near me are wicked tormentors, who are far from thoughts of your law;
019	PSA	119	151	but near, too, are you, O Lord, and all your commandments are trusty.
019	PSA	119	152	Long have I known from your charges that you have founded them for all time.
019	PSA	119	153	Look on my misery, and rescue me; for I do not forget your law.
019	PSA	119	154	Defend my cause and redeem me: revive me, as you have promised.
019	PSA	119	155	Salvation is far from the wicked, for their mind is not in your statutes.
019	PSA	119	156	Great is your pity, O Lord: Revive me, as you have ordained.
019	PSA	119	157	My foes and tormentors are many, but I have not declined from your charges.
019	PSA	119	158	I behold the traitors with loathing, for they do not observe your word.
019	PSA	119	159	Behold how I love your precepts: revive me, O Lord!, in your kindness.
019	PSA	119	160	The sum of your word is truth, all your laws are just and eternal.
019	PSA	119	161	Princes have harassed me wantonly: but my heart stands in awe of your word.
019	PSA	119	162	Over your word I rejoice as one who finds great spoil.
019	PSA	119	163	Falsehood I hate and abhor, but your law do I love.
019	PSA	119	164	Seven times a day do I praise you because of your righteous judgments.
019	PSA	119	165	Right well do they fare who love your law: they go on their way without stumbling.
019	PSA	119	166	I hope for your salvation; O Lord I do your commandments.
019	PSA	119	167	I observe your charges: I love them greatly.
019	PSA	119	168	I observe your precepts and charges: all my ways are before you.
019	PSA	119	169	Let my cry come before you, O Lord: give me insight, as you have promised.
019	PSA	119	170	Let my prayer enter into your presence: deliver me, as you have said.
019	PSA	119	171	My lips shall be fountains of praise, that you teach me your statutes.
019	PSA	119	172	My tongue shall sing of your word, for all your commandments are right.
019	PSA	119	173	Let your hand be ready to help me, for your precepts have been my choice.
019	PSA	119	174	I long, Lord, for your salvation, and your law is my delight.
019	PSA	119	175	Revive me that I may praise you, and let your precepts help me.
019	PSA	119	176	I have strayed like a wandering sheep seek your servant, because I do not forget your commandments.
019	PSA	120	001	A song of ascents. In distress I cried to the Lord, and he answered me.
019	PSA	120	002	‘Deliver me, Lord, from the lip that is false and the tongue that is crafty.’
019	PSA	120	003	What shall he give to you, you tongue that is crafty? What yet shall he give to you?
019	PSA	120	004	Arrows of warrior, sharpened, with glowing broom coals together.
019	PSA	120	005	Woe is me that I sojourn in Meshech, that I live by the tents of Kedar.
019	PSA	120	006	Already too long have I dwelt among those who hate peace.
019	PSA	120	007	I am for peace: but when I speak of it, they are for war.
019	PSA	121	001	A song of ascents. I lift up my eyes to the mountains. From where will help for me come?
019	PSA	121	002	My help will come from the Lord the creator of heaven and earth.
019	PSA	121	003	Your foot he will not let stumble: he who guards you will not sleep.
019	PSA	121	004	He who watches over Israel will neither slumber nor sleep.
019	PSA	121	005	The Lord himself protects you, is your shelter beside you.
019	PSA	121	006	The sun by day will not strike you, nor the moon by night.
019	PSA	121	007	From all harm the Lord will guard you, will watch over your life.
019	PSA	121	008	The Lord will guard your going and coming from now and for evermore.
019	PSA	122	001	A song of ascents. Of David. I was glad when they said to me, ‘We will go to the house of the Lord.’
019	PSA	122	002	Now we are standing, within your gates, O Jerusalem.
019	PSA	122	003	O Jerusalem, built close-packed, like a city without breach or gap,
019	PSA	122	004	to you do the tribes come, the tribes of the Lord, as the law has ordained for Israel, there to give thanks to the Lord.
019	PSA	122	005	There once stood thrones of justice even thrones of the household of David.
019	PSA	122	006	Pray that all may be well with Jerusalem, and well with those who love you,
019	PSA	122	007	well within your ramparts, and well within your palaces.
019	PSA	122	008	For the sake of my brethren and friends, I will wish you now prosperity:
019	PSA	122	009	for the sake of the house of the Lord our God, I will seek your good.
019	PSA	123	001	A song of ascents. I Lift up my eyes to you, who are throned in the heavens.
019	PSA	123	002	As the eyes of a servant turn to the hand of his master, or the eyes of a maid to the hand of her mistress, so do our eyes turn to the Lord our God, until he is gracious to us.
019	PSA	123	003	Be gracious, be gracious to us, Lord. Scorn enough, and more, have we borne
019	PSA	123	004	More than enough have we borne of derision from those at their ease, of scorn from those who are haughty.
019	PSA	124	001	A song of ascents. Of David. ‘Had it not been the Lord who was for us’ let Israel say
019	PSA	124	002	‘Had it not been the Lord who was for us when enemies rose against us,
019	PSA	124	003	then alive they’d have swallowed us up, when their anger was kindled against us.
019	PSA	124	004	Then the waters would’ve swept us away, and the torrent passed over us clean:
019	PSA	124	005	then most sure would’ve passed over us clean the wild seething waters.’
019	PSA	124	006	Blest be the Lord who has given us not to be torn by their teeth.
019	PSA	124	007	We are like a bird just escaped from the snare of the fowler. The snare is broken, and we are escaped.
019	PSA	124	008	Our help is the name of the Lord, the Creator of heaven and earth.
019	PSA	125	001	A song of ascents. Those who trust in the Lord are like Mount Zion, that cannot be moved, but abides forever.
019	PSA	125	002	Round Jerusalem are the mountains, and the Lord is round his people from now and for evermore.
019	PSA	125	003	For he will not suffer the sceptre of wrong to rest on the land allotted to the righteous; else the righteous might put forth their own hand to evil.
019	PSA	125	004	Do good, O Lord, to the good, and to the true-hearted.
019	PSA	125	005	But those who swerve into crooked ways will the Lord lead away with the workers of evil. Peace be upon Israel.
019	PSA	126	001	A song of ascents. When the Lord turned the fortunes of Zion, we were like dreamers.
019	PSA	126	002	Then was our mouth filled with laughter, our tongue with glad shouts; then among the nations they said, ‘The Lord has dealt greatly with them.’
019	PSA	126	003	The Lord had dealt greatly with us, and we were rejoicing.
019	PSA	126	004	Turn our fortunes, O Lord, as the streams in the Negreb.
019	PSA	126	005	They who sow in tears shall reap with glad shouts.
019	PSA	126	006	Forth they fare, with their burden of seed, and they weep as they go. But home, home, with glad shouts they shall come with their arms full of sheaves.
019	PSA	127	001	A song of ascents. Of Solomon. Unless the Lord builds the house, those who build it labour in vain. Unless the Lord guards the city, the watchman wakes in vain.
019	PSA	127	002	In vain you rise early, and finish so late, and so eat sorrow’s bread; for he cares for his loved ones in their sleep.
019	PSA	127	003	Children are a gift of the Lord, the fruit of the womb, a reward.
019	PSA	127	004	Like arrows wielded by warriors, are the children of youth.
019	PSA	127	005	Happy the man who has filled his quiver full of them. He will not be ashamed when he speaks with enemies in the gate.
019	PSA	128	001	A song of ascents. Happy all who fear the Lord, who walk in his ways.
019	PSA	128	002	You will eat what your hands have toiled for, and be happy and prosperous!
019	PSA	128	003	Like a fruitful vine shall your wife be in the innermost room of your house: your children, like olive shoots, round about your table.
019	PSA	128	004	See! This is the blessing of the man who fears the Lord.
019	PSA	128	005	The Lord shall bless you from Zion. You will see Jerusalem nourish all the days of your life.
019	PSA	128	006	You will see your children’s children. Peace upon Israel.
019	PSA	129	001	A song of ascents. ‘Sore have they vexed me from youth’ thus let Israel say
019	PSA	129	002	‘Sore have they vexed me from youth, but they have not prevailed against me.
019	PSA	129	003	‘The ploughers ploughed on my back, they made their furrows long.
019	PSA	129	004	But the Lord, who is righteous, has cut the cords of the wicked.’
019	PSA	129	005	Let all who are haters of Zion be put to shame and defeated.
019	PSA	129	006	May they be as the grass on the house-top, which withers before it shoots up;
019	PSA	129	007	which fills not the arms of the reaper, nor the lap of the binder of sheaves
019	PSA	129	008	whereof no one says as they pass, ‘The blessing of God be upon you.’ In the name of the Lord we bless you.
019	PSA	130	001	A song of ascents. Out of the depths I call to you, Lord.
019	PSA	130	002	Lord, hear my voice: give heed with your ears to my loud plea.
019	PSA	130	003	If you should mark sin, Lord, O Lord, who could stand?
019	PSA	130	004	But with you is forgiveness, that you may be feared.
019	PSA	130	005	I wait for the Lord, I wait for his word,
019	PSA	130	006	I look for the Lord more than watchman for morning, than watchman for morning.
019	PSA	130	007	Israel, hope in the Lord: with the Lord there is love with him plenteous redemption.
019	PSA	130	008	And he redeems Israel from all his iniquities.
019	PSA	131	001	A song of ascents. Of David. O Lord, my heart is not haughty, my eyes are not lofty, I walk not among great things, things too wonderful for me.
019	PSA	131	002	Yes, I have soothed and stilled myself, like a young child on his mother’s lap; like a young child am I.
019	PSA	131	003	O Israel, hope in the Lord from now and for evermore.
019	PSA	132	001	A song of ascents. Remember, O Lord, David all his sufferings,
019	PSA	132	002	the oath that he swore to the Lord, and his vow to the Strong One of Jacob,
019	PSA	132	003	never to enter his tent, never to lie on his bed,
019	PSA	132	004	never to give his eyes sleep or his eyelids slumber,
019	PSA	132	005	till he had found a place for the Lord, for the Strong One of Jacob to live in.
019	PSA	132	006	We heard of it in Ephrathah, in the fields of Jaar we found it.
019	PSA	132	007	We went to the place where he dwelt, we bowed ourselves low at his footstool.
019	PSA	132	008	‘Arise, Lord, and enter your resting-place, you and your mighty ark.
019	PSA	132	009	Let your priests wear a garment of righteousness, your faithful shout aloud for joy.
019	PSA	132	010	For the sake of David your servant, do not reject your Anointed.’
019	PSA	132	011	The Lord swore an oath to David an oath that he will not break; ‘I will set on your throne a prince of your line.
019	PSA	132	012	If your sons keep my covenant and the statutes I teach them, then their sons, too, forever, will sit on your throne.’
019	PSA	132	013	For the choice of the Lord is Zion; she is the home of his heart.
019	PSA	132	014	‘This is forever my resting-place, this is the home of my heart.
019	PSA	132	015	I will royally bless her provision, and give bread to her poor in abundance.
019	PSA	132	016	Her priests I will clothe with salvation; her faithful will shout for joy.
019	PSA	132	017	There will I raise up for David a dynasty of power. I have set my anointed a lamp that shall never go out.
019	PSA	132	018	Robes of shame I will put on his foes, but on his head a glittering crown.’
019	PSA	133	001	A song of ascents. Of David. Behold! How good and how pleasant is the dwelling of kindred together!
019	PSA	133	002	Like precious oil on the head that ran down on the beard, the beard of Aaron, running over the collar of his robe:
019	PSA	133	003	like the dew upon Hermon which falls on the mountains of Zion. For there has the Lord ordained blessing – life that is endless.
019	PSA	134	001	A song of ascents. Come, praise the Lord, all you the Lord’s servants, who stand by night in the house of the Lord.
019	PSA	134	002	Lift your hands to the holy place, praise the Lord.
019	PSA	134	003	The Lord who made heaven and earth, bless you from Zion.
019	PSA	135	001	Hallelujah. Praise the name of the Lord. Praise the Lord, you his servants,
019	PSA	135	002	who stand in the house of the Lord, in the courts of the house of our God.
019	PSA	135	003	Praise the Lord, for the Lord is good: Sing praise to his name it is pleasant.
019	PSA	135	004	The Lord for himself chose Jacob, Israel as his own special treasure.
019	PSA	135	005	For I know that the Lord is great, that our Lord is above all gods.
019	PSA	135	006	All that he wills he does in the heavens and on the earth, in the seas and in all the abysses.
019	PSA	135	007	Clouds he brings up from the ends of the earth, lightnings he makes for the rain, wind he brings out of his storehouses.
019	PSA	135	008	The firstborn of Egypt he struck, both humans and animals.
019	PSA	135	009	Signs and wonders he sent into your midst, O Egypt, upon Pharaoh and all his servants.
019	PSA	135	010	Many nations he struck, mighty kings he slew
019	PSA	135	011	Sihon, king of the Amorites, Og, king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan.
019	PSA	135	012	He gave their land for possession, possession to Israel his people.
019	PSA	135	013	Your name, O Lord, is forever; your memorial world without end.
019	PSA	135	014	For the Lord secures right for his people, and takes pity upon his servants.
019	PSA	135	015	The idols of heathen are silver made by human hands.
019	PSA	135	016	They have mouths, but cannot speak: they have eyes, but cannot see.
019	PSA	135	017	They have ears, but cannot hear: there is no breath in their mouths.
019	PSA	135	018	Their makers become like them, so do all who trust in them.
019	PSA	135	019	House of Israel, praise the Lord: house of Araon, praise the Lord.
019	PSA	135	020	House of Levi, praise the Lord: you who fear the Lord, praise the Lord.
019	PSA	135	021	Blest be the Lord out of Zion, who lives in Jerusalem. Hallelujah.
019	PSA	136	001	Give thanks to the Lord for his goodness: for his kindness endures forever.
019	PSA	136	002	Give thanks to the God of gods: for his kindness endures forever.
019	PSA	136	003	Give thanks to the Lord of lords: for his kindness endures forever.

019	PSA	136	005	Whose wisdom created the heavens: for his kindness endures forever.
019	PSA	136	006	Who spread forth the earth on the waters: for his kindness endures forever.
019	PSA	136	007	Who made great lights: for his kindness endures forever.
019	PSA	136	008	The sun to rule over the day: for his kindness endures forever.
019	PSA	136	009	Moon and stars to rule over the night: for his kindness endures forever.
019	PSA	136	010	Who struck the firstborn of Egypt: for his kindness endures forever.
019	PSA	136	011	And brought Israel out from their midst: for his kindness endures forever.
019	PSA	136	012	With strong hand and outstretched arm: for his kindness endures forever.
019	PSA	136	013	Who cut the Red Sea in pieces: for his kindness endures forever.
019	PSA	136	014	And brought Israel right through the midst: for his kindness endures forever.
019	PSA	136	015	And shook Pharaoh with all his host into the sea for his kindness endures forever.
019	PSA	136	016	Who led his people through the desert: for his kindness endures forever.
019	PSA	136	017	Who struck down great kings: for his kindness endures forever.
019	PSA	136	018	And slew noble kings: for his kindness endures forever.
019	PSA	136	019	Sihon, king of the Amorites: for his kindness endures forever.
019	PSA	136	020	And Og, king of Bashan: for his kindness endures forever.
019	PSA	136	021	Who gave their land for possession: for his kindness endures forever.
019	PSA	136	022	Possession to Israel his servant: for his kindness endures forever.
019	PSA	136	023	Who remembered our low estate: for his kindness endures forever.
019	PSA	136	024	And rescued us from our foes: for his kindness endures forever.
019	PSA	136	025	Who gives to all flesh food: for his kindness endures forever.
019	PSA	136	026	Give thanks to the God of heaven: for his kindness endures forever.
019	PSA	137	001	By the waters of Babylon there we sat, and we wept at the thought of Zion.
019	PSA	137	002	There on the poplars we hung our harps.
019	PSA	137	003	For there our captors called for a song: our tormentors, rejoicing, saying: ‘Sing us one of the songs of Zion.’
019	PSA	137	004	How can we sing the Lord’s song in the foreigner’s land?
019	PSA	137	005	If I forget you, Jerusalem, may my right hand wither.
019	PSA	137	006	May my tongue stick to the roof of my mouth, if I am unmindful of you, or don’t set Jerusalem above my chief joy.
019	PSA	137	007	Remember the Edomites, Lord, the day of Jerusalem’s fall, when they said, ‘Lay her bare, lay her bare, right down to her very foundation.’
019	PSA	137	008	Babylon, despoiler, happy are those who pay you back for all you have done to us.
019	PSA	137	009	Happy are they who seize and dash your children against the rocks.
019	PSA	138	001	Of David. I will thank you, O Lord, with all my heart: in the sight of the gods I will sing your praise,
019	PSA	138	002	and prostrate before your holy temple, will praise your name for your constant love, for you have exulted your promise above all.
019	PSA	138	003	When I called you, you answered; you gave me strength, you inspired me.
019	PSA	138	004	All the kings of the earth shall praise you, O Lord, when they shall have heard the words you have uttered;
019	PSA	138	005	and they shall sing of the ways of the Lord, and tell of the Lord’s transcendent glory.
019	PSA	138	006	For, high though the Lord is, he looks on the lowly, and strikes down the haughty from far away.
019	PSA	138	007	Though my way be distressful, yet you preserve me: you lay your hand on my angry foes, and your right hand gives me victory.
019	PSA	138	008	The Lord will accomplish all that which concerns me. Your kindness, O Lord, endures forever. O do not abandon the work of your hands.
019	PSA	139	001	For the leader. Of David, a psalm. O Lord, you search and know me;
019	PSA	139	002	when I sit, when I rise you know it, you perceive my thoughts from afar.
019	PSA	139	003	When I walk, when I lie you sift it, familiar with all my ways.
019	PSA	139	004	There is not a word on my tongue, but see! Lord, you know it all.
019	PSA	139	005	Behind and before you beset me, upon me you lay your hand.
019	PSA	139	006	It’s too wonderful for me to know too lofty I cannot attain it.
019	PSA	139	007	Whither shall I go from your spirit? Or whither shall I flee from your face?
019	PSA	139	008	If I climb up to heaven, you are there: or make Sheol my bed, you are there.
019	PSA	139	009	If I lift up the wings of the morning and fly to the end of the sea,
019	PSA	139	010	there also your hand would grasp me, and your right hand take hold of me.
019	PSA	139	011	If I say, ‘Let the darkness cover me, and night be the light about me,’
019	PSA	139	012	The dark is not dark for you, but night is as light as the day.
019	PSA	139	013	For you did put me together; in my mother’s womb you did weave me.
019	PSA	139	014	I give you praise for my fashioning so full of awe, so wonderful. Your works are wonderful. You knew me right well;
019	PSA	139	015	my bones were not hidden from you, when I was made in secret, and woven in the depths of the earth.
019	PSA	139	016	Your eyes saw all my days: they stood on your book every one written down, before they were fashioned, while none of them yet was mine.
019	PSA	139	017	But how far, O God, beyond measure are your thoughts! How mighty their sum!
019	PSA	139	018	Should I count, they are more than the sand. When I wake, I am still with you.
019	PSA	139	019	Will you slay the wicked, O God? And remove from me the bloodthirsty,
019	PSA	139	020	who maliciously defy you and take your name in vain.
019	PSA	139	021	Do I not hate those who hate you, Lord? Do I not loathe those who resist you?
019	PSA	139	022	With perfect hatred I hate them, I count them my enemies.
019	PSA	139	023	Search me, O God, know my heart: test me, and know my thoughts,
019	PSA	139	024	and see if guile be in me; and lead me in the way everlasting.
019	PSA	140	001	To the leader. A Psalm of David. Rescue me, Lord, from evil people; from the violent guard me
019	PSA	140	002	from those who plot evil in their heart, and stir up war continually:
019	PSA	140	003	who make their tongue as sharp as a serpent’s, and under whose lips is the poison of adders. (Selah)
019	PSA	140	004	Preserve me, O Lord, from the hands of the wicked, from the violent guard me from those who are plotting to trip up my feet.
019	PSA	140	005	The proud have hidden a trap for me, cords they have spread as a net for my feet: snares they have set at the side of my track. (Selah)
019	PSA	140	006	I have said to the Lord, ‘My God are you; attend, Lord, to my loud plea.
019	PSA	140	007	O Lord my Lord, my saviour mighty, you did cover my head in the day of battle.
019	PSA	140	008	Grant not, O Lord, the desires of the wicked; and what they have purposed, promote you not.’ (Selah)
019	PSA	140	009	Let them not lift up their heads against me. May the mischief they prate bring themselves to destruction,
019	PSA	140	010	may he rain upon them coals of fire, may he strike them down swiftly, to rise no more,
019	PSA	140	011	no place in the land may there be for the slanderer: may the violent be hunted from sorrow to sorrow.
019	PSA	140	012	I know that the Lord will do right by the weak, and will execute justice for those who are needy.
019	PSA	140	013	Surely the righteous shall praise your name, and they who are upright shall live in your presence.
019	PSA	141	001	A psalm of David. Lord, I call to you: hasten, to me, attend to my voice, when I call to you.
019	PSA	141	002	Let my prayer be presented as incense before you, and my uplifted hands as the evening meal-offering.
019	PSA	141	003	Set, O Lord, a watch on my mouth, put a guard on the door of my lips.
019	PSA	141	004	Incline not my heart to an evil matter, to busy myself in deeds of wickedness, in company with workers of evil: never may I partake of their dainties.
019	PSA	141	005	A wound or reproof from a good person in kindness is oil which my head shall never refuse. In their misfortune my prayer is still with them.
019	PSA	141	006	Abandoned they are to the hands of their judges: they shall learn that my words are true.
019	PSA	141	007	Like stones on a country road cleft and broken so lie our bones scattered for Death to devour.
019	PSA	141	008	But my eyes are turned towards you, O Lord. Do not pour out my life, for in you I take refuge.
019	PSA	141	009	Keep me safe from the trap they have laid for me, from the snares of the workers of trouble.
019	PSA	141	010	Into their own nets let wicked people fall; while I pass by in safety.
019	PSA	142	001	A maskil of David, while he was in the cave, a prayer. Loudly I cry to the Lord: to the Lord plead loudly for mercy,
019	PSA	142	002	I pour my complaint before him, I tell my troubles to him.
019	PSA	142	003	When my spirit is faint within me, my path is known to you. In the way I am wont to walk in, they have hidden a trap for me.
019	PSA	142	004	I look to the right and the left; but not a friend have I. No place of refuge is left me, not a man to care for me.
019	PSA	142	005	So I cry to you, O Lord: I say, ‘My refuge are you, all I have in the land of the living.’
019	PSA	142	006	Attend to my piercing cry, for very weak am I. Save me from those who pursue me, for they are too strong for me.
019	PSA	142	007	Free me from prison, that I may give thanks to your name, for the righteous are patiently waiting till you show your bounty to me.
019	PSA	143	001	A psalm of David. Listen, O Lord, to my prayer; attend to my plea. In your faithfulness give me answer, and in your righteousness.
019	PSA	143	002	With your servant O enter you not into judgment, for in your sight can no one alive be justified.
019	PSA	143	003	For the enemy persecutes me, crushing my life to the ground, making me live in the darkness, as those who have long been dead.
019	PSA	143	004	My spirit is faint within me, my heart is bewildered within me.
019	PSA	143	005	I remember the days of old, and brood over all you have done, musing on all that your hands have wrought.
019	PSA	143	006	I spread out my hands to you: I thirst for you, like parched earth. (Selah)
019	PSA	143	007	Answer me soon, Lord, because my spirit is spent. Hide not your face from me, else become I like those who go down to the pit.
019	PSA	143	008	Let me learn of your love in the morning, for my trust is in you. Teach me the way I should go: for my heart longs for you.
019	PSA	143	009	Save me, O Lord, from my foes: for to you I have fled for refuge.
019	PSA	143	010	Teach me to do your will, for you yourself are my God. Guide me by your good spirit, O Lord, on a way that is smooth.
019	PSA	143	011	Be true to your name Lord, spare me, bring me out of distress in your faithfulness.
019	PSA	143	012	In your kindness extinguish my enemies, and all those who vex me destroy; for I am your servant.
019	PSA	144	001	Of David. Blest be the Lord my rock, who trains my hands for war, my fingers for fighting.
019	PSA	144	002	My rock and my fortress, my tower, my deliverer, my shield, behind whom I take refuge, who lays nations low at my feet.
019	PSA	144	003	Lord, what are mortals that you care for them, humans, that you think of them?
019	PSA	144	004	They are like a breath, their days as a shadow that passes.
019	PSA	144	005	Lord, bow your heavens and come down: touch the hills, so that they smoke.
019	PSA	144	006	Flash forth lightning and scatter them, your arrows send forth and confound them.
019	PSA	144	007	Stretch out your hand from on high; pluck me out of the mighty waters, out of the hands of foreigners,
019	PSA	144	008	who speak with the mouth of falsehood, and lift their right hand to swear lies.
019	PSA	144	009	O God, a new song I would sing you, on a ten-stringed harp make you music.
019	PSA	144	010	For to kings you give the victory, and David your servant you save.
019	PSA	144	011	Snatch me from the cruel sword, rescue me from the hand of foreigners, who speak with the mouth of falsehood, and lift their right hand to swear lies.
019	PSA	144	012	May our sons in their youth be as plants well tended: our daughters like cornices carved as in palaces.
019	PSA	144	013	May our barns be bursting with produce of all kinds. In the fields may our sheep bear by thousands and ten thousands.
019	PSA	144	014	May our cattle be fat, our walls unbreached, may no cry of distress ring in our streets.
019	PSA	144	015	Happy the people who fares so well: and so fares the people whose God is the Lord.
019	PSA	145	001	A song of praise. Of David. I will exalt you, my God, O king: I will praise your name for ever and ever.
019	PSA	145	002	I will bless you every day: I will praise your name for ever and ever.
019	PSA	145	003	Great is the Lord and worthy all praise, his greatness is unsearchable.
019	PSA	145	004	One age to another shall praise your deeds, declaring the mighty things you have done.
019	PSA	145	005	Of your glorious majesty they shall tell, and I will muse of your many wonders.
019	PSA	145	006	Of the might of your terrible acts they shall speak, and the tale of your great deeds I will tell.
019	PSA	145	007	The fame of your abundant goodness and righteousness they shall pour forth in song.
019	PSA	145	008	The Lord is full of grace and pity, patient and rich in loving-kindness.
019	PSA	145	009	The Lord is good to all the world, and his pity is over all things that he made.
019	PSA	145	010	All your works give you thanks, O Lord, and you are blessed of those who love you.
019	PSA	145	011	They shall speak of your glorious kingdom, and of your might shall they discourse,
019	PSA	145	012	making known to all his mighty acts, and the glorious majesty of his kingdom.
019	PSA	145	013	Yours is a kingdom that lives through all ages: through all generations extends your dominion.
019	PSA	145	014	The Lord upholds all who fall; he lifts up all who are bowed down.
019	PSA	145	015	The eyes of all look in hope to you, and you give them their food in due season.
019	PSA	145	016	You yourself open your hand, and fill with your favour all things that live.
019	PSA	145	017	The Lord is righteous in all his ways, gracious is he in all that he does.
019	PSA	145	018	The Lord is near to all who call him, to all who call upon him in truth.
019	PSA	145	019	He will fulfil the desires of those who fear him; he will hear their cry for help and save them.
019	PSA	145	020	The Lord is the keeper of all who love him, but all the wicked will he destroy.
019	PSA	145	021	My mouth will utter the praise of the Lord, and all life will bless his holy name for ever and ever.
019	PSA	146	001	My soul, praise the Lord.
019	PSA	146	002	I will praise the Lord, while I live; I will sing to my God, while I am.
019	PSA	146	003	Put not your trust in princes mortals, in whom is no help.
019	PSA	146	004	When their breath goes out, they go back to the dust: on that very day their purposes perish.
019	PSA	146	005	Happy those whose help is the God of Jacob: whose hope is set on the Lord their God,
019	PSA	146	006	the Creator of heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them. He remains eternally loyal.
019	PSA	146	007	For the wronged he executes justice; he gives bread to the hungry; the Lord releases the prisoners.
019	PSA	146	008	The Lord gives sight to the blind: the Lord raises those who are bowed. The Lord loves the righteous.
019	PSA	146	009	The Lord preserves the stranger, upholds the widow and orphan, but the wicked he leads to disaster.
019	PSA	146	010	The Lord shall reign forever, your God, O Zion, to all generations. Hallelujah.
019	PSA	147	001	Hallelujah. It is good to sing praise to our God, for praise is sweet and seemly.
019	PSA	147	002	The Lord builds up Jerusalem, the outcasts of Israel he gathers.
019	PSA	147	003	He heals the broken in heart, and binds up their wounds.
019	PSA	147	004	He counts the numberless stars, he gives names to them all.

019	PSA	147	006	The Lord lifts up the down-trodden, the wicked he brings to the ground.
019	PSA	147	007	Sing songs of thanks to the Lord, and play on the lyre to our God.
019	PSA	147	008	For he covers the sky with clouds, he prepares rain for the earth, makes grass to grow on the mountains.
019	PSA	147	009	He gives the cattle their food the young ravens when they cry.
019	PSA	147	010	His pleasure is not in the strength of the horse, his joy is not in the speed of a runner;
019	PSA	147	011	but the Lord has his pleasure in those who fear him, in those who wait for his kindness.
019	PSA	147	012	Praise the Lord, then, O Jerusalem: sing praise to your God, O Zion.
019	PSA	147	013	For he strengthens the bars of your gates, and blesses your children within you.
019	PSA	147	014	He brings peace to your borders, and choicest of wheat in abundance.
019	PSA	147	015	He sends his command to the earth: his word runs very swiftly.
019	PSA	147	016	Snow he gives like wool, frost he scatters like ashes.
019	PSA	147	017	He casts forth his ice like morsels: who can stand before his cold?
019	PSA	147	018	He sends forth his word, and melts them: his wind blows the waters flow.
019	PSA	147	019	He declares his word to Jacob, his statutes and judgments to Israel.

019	PSA	149	007	on the heathen to execute vengeance, and chastisement sore on the nations,
019	PSA	149	008	binding their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron,

# BOOK	028	HOS	Hosea	Hosea
028	HOS	001	001	The Lord’s message to Hosea son of Beeri during the reigns of Kings Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah of Judah and during the reign of King Jeroboam, son of Joash of Israel.
028	HOS	001	002	When the Lord began to speak through Hosea, he said to him: ‘Go marry an unfaithful woman who will bear you children by her adultery, for like an adulterous wife the land is unfaithful to the Lord.’
028	HOS	001	003	So he married Gomer, the daughter of Dibliam, and when she conceived and bore him a son,
028	HOS	001	004	the Lord said: ‘Call him “Jezreel,” for in a little while I will punish the dynasty of Jehu for the blood shed at the valley of Jezreel, I will cause the kingdom of Israel to cease.
028	HOS	001	005	On that day, I will break Israel’s bows and arrows in the valley of Jezreel.’
028	HOS	001	006	When she conceived again and bore a daughter, the Lord said to Hosea: ‘Call her Lo-Ruhamah – “No-Compassion” for I will no longer have compassion on Israel, certainly not spare them.
028	HOS	001	007	But on Judah I will have compassion, I will deliver them by the Lord their God, but I will not deliver them by bow nor by sword, nor by battle nor by horses nor by horsemen.’
028	HOS	001	008	After she had weaned No-Compassion, and when she conceived and bore a son, he said:
028	HOS	001	009	‘Call him Lo-Ammi – “Not-My-People” for you, Israel, are not my people, and I indeed am not your God.’
028	HOS	001	010	Yet the number of the Israelites will be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured or counted, and where they were told, ‘You are not my people,’ they will be called, ‘children of the living God.’
028	HOS	001	011	The Judeans and the Israelites will join together again, will appoint for themselves one leader, will return to their own land. Great will be the day of Jezreel!
028	HOS	002	001	So call your brothers, My People, and your sisters, Compassion.
028	HOS	002	002	Accuse, accuse your mother: for she is not my wife, and I will not be her husband. Let her put her acts of infidelity out of her sight, and her lovers from between her breasts,
028	HOS	002	003	else I will strip her bare, expose her as she was on the day of her birth, make her like the wilderness, let her become like a parched land, and let her die of thirst.
028	HOS	002	004	And on her children I will have no pity, since they are children of adultery,
028	HOS	002	005	for their mother has become a prostitute, she who conceived them has behaved shamefully. She has said, ‘I will go after my lovers who gave me my bread and my water, my wool, my flax, my oil, and my drink.’
028	HOS	002	006	That is why I am going to hedge up her ways with thorns, and build a wall about her, so that she cannot find her paths.
028	HOS	002	007	She will pursue her lovers, but will not overtake them. She will seek them, but not find them. In time she will say, ‘I will go back to my first husband, I was better off then than now.’
028	HOS	002	008	She herself did not know that it was I who gave her the grain, the sweet wine, and the oil, who lavished on her silver and gold – that they used in worshipping Baal!
028	HOS	002	009	So I will take back my grain at the harvest, and my sweet wine in its season. I will withdraw my wool and my flax, given to cover her nakedness;
028	HOS	002	010	and so I will strip her naked before her lovers, and no one can deliver her out of my hand.
028	HOS	002	011	I will end all her celebrations, her yearly feasts, her new moons, and her sabbaths, all her festivals.
028	HOS	002	012	I will lay waste her vines and her fig trees, of which she says, ‘These are my wages which my lovers have given me.’ I will make them a thicket, and the wild animals will eat them.
028	HOS	002	013	In this way I will punish her for the days of the Baals, in which she made offerings to them, and decked herself with earrings and jewels, and went after her lovers, but forgot me, – declares the Lord.
028	HOS	002	014	So I am going to court her, bring her into the wilderness, and speak tenderly to her.
028	HOS	002	015	I will give her from there her vineyards, and the valley of Achor as a door of hope. There she will respond as in the days of her youth, as in the days when she came up from the land of Egypt.
028	HOS	002	016	At that time, declares the Lord, you will call me your husband, and will no more call me your master.
028	HOS	002	017	I will remove the name of the Baals from her mouth, their names never again uttered.
028	HOS	002	018	On that day I will make for them a covenant with the wild animals, the birds of the sky, and the creatures that crawl on the earth. I will break the bow and the sword, banish battle from the land, and I will make them lie down in safety.
028	HOS	002	019	I will take you for my wife forever, I will take you for my wife in righteousness, in justice, in kindness, and in mercy.
028	HOS	002	020	I will take you for my wife in faithfulness, and you will know the Lord.
028	HOS	002	021	On that day I will answer – declares the Lord, I will answer the empty skies, and they will answer the dry earth.
028	HOS	002	022	The earth will answer with grain, and new wine and oil, and they will answer Jezreel,
028	HOS	002	023	and I will plant her in the land. I will have compassion to No-Compassion, I will say to Not-My-People, ‘You are my people,’ and they will say, ‘You are my God.’
028	HOS	003	001	Then the Lord said to me, ‘Go again, show love to this woman, who is loved by another, who commits adultery. Love her as the Lord loves the Israelites, though they turn to other gods, and love the raisin cakes offered to idols.
028	HOS	003	002	So I redeemed her for fifteen pieces of silver and a homer and a lethek of barley.
028	HOS	003	003	And I told her, ‘You must live with me for many days and you must not sleep around or marry another. And I will do the same for you.
028	HOS	003	004	And like this the Israelites will live for a long time without king and without prince, without sacrifice and without pillar, without ephod and without teraphim.
028	HOS	003	005	Yet afterward the Israelites will return, and seek the Lord their God and their Davidic king, and in the days to come they will turn with awe to the Lord and his goodness.
028	HOS	004	001	Hear the Lord’s message, Israelites, for the Lord has brought charges against the inhabitants of the land, for there is no fidelity, nor true love, nor knowledge of God in the land,
028	HOS	004	002	but cursing, lying, and murder, stealing, committing adultery, and deeds of violence, and acts of bloodshed quickly follow each other.
028	HOS	004	003	Therefore the land mourns, all its inhabitants languish, the wild animals and the birds of the skies, even the fish of the sea are dying.
028	HOS	004	004	Yet let no one bring charges, let none accuse, for your people are like those, who bring charges against a priest.
028	HOS	004	005	You stumble by day, and the prophet stumbles with you by night, and I will destroy your mother.
028	HOS	004	006	My people are being destroyed for lack of knowledge; because you have rejected knowledge I reject you from being priest to me. Since you have forgotten the teaching of your God, I also will forget your children.
028	HOS	004	007	The more priests there are, the more they sin against me. I will change their dignity to dishonour.
028	HOS	004	008	They feed on the sin offerings of my people, so they hunger after their guilt.
028	HOS	004	009	Thus it comes to be, like people, like priest: I will visit upon each punishment for their ways, and their deeds I will repay them.
028	HOS	004	010	They will eat and not be satisfied, they will sleep around but stay childless, because they have abandoned the Lord to give themselves to
028	HOS	004	011	prostitution. Old and new wine take away the understanding.
028	HOS	004	012	My own people ask counsel of a piece of wood! A stick gives them advice! For a spirit of prostitution has led them astray, they commit adultery against their God.
028	HOS	004	013	On the heights of the mountains they sacrifice, and on the hills they burn incense under oaks and poplars and terebinths, for their shade is so pleasant. Therefore your daughters become cult prostitutes, and your daughters-in-law commit adultery.
028	HOS	004	014	I will not punish your daughters for committing prostitution, nor your daughters-in-law for adultery. Your men visit prostitutes, sacrifice with cult prostitutes. So a people without understanding come to ruin!
028	HOS	004	015	Though you commit adultery, Israel, let not Judah become guilty. Do not go to Gilgal, do not go up to Beth-aven, nor swear an oath, ‘As the Lord lives.’
028	HOS	004	016	Like a wilful heifer, Israel is stubborn. Can the Lord now feed them as he would a lamb in a broad pasture?
028	HOS	004	017	Ephraim is wedded to idols. Leave them alone!
028	HOS	004	018	When their drinking is over they sleep with the cult prostitutes, their rulers love shameful ways.
028	HOS	004	019	A windstorm will wrap them in its wings and they will be ashamed of their sacrifices.
028	HOS	005	001	Hear this, priests! Attend, Israelites! Listen, royal family! For you is the judgment: a snare you have become at Mizpeh, and a net spread out on Tabor,
028	HOS	005	002	the rebels are deep in slaughter, but I will discipline all.
028	HOS	005	003	I know Ephraim, Israel is not hidden from me, for you, Ephraim, have committed prostitution and Israel is defiled.
028	HOS	005	004	Their deeds do not permit them to return to their God. For the spirit of prostitution is within them, they do not know the Lord.
028	HOS	005	005	Israel’s arrogance testifies against them, Israel, even Ephraim, stumble in their sin, and Judah also stumbles with them.
028	HOS	005	006	With their sheep and their cattle they will go to seek the Lord but they will not find him, he has withdrawn from them,
028	HOS	005	007	for they have been untrue to the Lord, their children are strangers. Their new moon festivals will soon destroy them and their fields.
028	HOS	005	008	Blow the trumpet in Gibeah, the clarion in Ramah! Raise the alarm in Beth-aven: we are with you, Benjamin!
028	HOS	005	009	Ephraim will become a desolation in the day of punishment, concerning the tribes of Israel I make known what is certain.
028	HOS	005	010	The princes of Israel have become like thieves who move boundary stones. On them I will pour out my wrath like a flood.
028	HOS	005	011	Ephraim will be oppressed, crushed by judgment, for they are determined to go after vanity.
028	HOS	005	012	So I am like a moth to Ephraim, like rottenness to the house of Judah.
028	HOS	005	013	For when Ephraim saw their sickness and Israel their wound, Ephraim turned to Assyria, to its patron king. But he cannot heal you nor relieve you of your wound.
028	HOS	005	014	For I myself will be like a lion to Ephraim, like a young lion to the house of Judah. I, yes I, will rend and go my way, I will carry off and none will rescue.
028	HOS	005	015	I will return to my place, until in remorse they seek my presence. When they are in distress they will quickly seek me,
028	HOS	006	001	saying, ‘Come let us return to the Lord, for he has torn us but he will heal us, he has injured us but he will bandage our wounds,
028	HOS	006	002	he will revive in a couple of days, on the third day he will raise us up again, to live in his presence.
028	HOS	006	003	Let us know, let us eagerly seek to know the Lord. His coming is as sure as the sunrise. He will come to us like the winter rain, as the spring rain that waters the earth.’
028	HOS	006	004	What can I make of you, Ephraim! What can I make of you, Judah! Your love is like a morning cloud, like the dew which early goes away.
028	HOS	006	005	That is why I have hewn them by the prophets, I have slain them by the words of my mouth. My judgment is like the light that goes forth,
028	HOS	006	006	for it is love that I delight in and not sacrifice, and knowledge of God and not burnt offerings.
028	HOS	006	007	But they after the manner of men have transgressed the covenant, there they have played me false.
028	HOS	006	008	Gilead is a city of evildoers, tracked with bloody footprints,
028	HOS	006	009	and as bandits lie in wait for a man, so a band of priests murder on the way to Shechem. How terrible is the evil they do!
028	HOS	006	010	In Bethel I have seen a horrible thing. There Ephraim plays the prostitute, Israel is defiled.
028	HOS	006	011	Judah for you also a harvest is set. When I would restore the fortunes of my people,
028	HOS	007	001	when I would heal Israel, then Ephrain’s guilt is revealed, and Samaria’s crimes are seen, how they practise fraud and the thief enters in, while outside bandits plunder.
028	HOS	007	002	But it never crosses their minds that I remember their wickedness. Now their misdeeds surround them, they are always before my face.
028	HOS	007	003	Their wickedness amuses the king, and their lying gladdens the princes,
028	HOS	007	004	since they are all of them adulterers. Their desire to do evil burns like an oven heated by the baker, so hot that he need not stir the fire, from the kneading of the dough, until it rises.
028	HOS	007	005	On our king’s festival day, the princes are flushed with fever from wine. He stretched forth his hand with the contemptuous,
028	HOS	007	006	for like an oven their heart burns with treachery, all night their anger smoulders, in the morning it blazes into a flame of fire.
028	HOS	007	007	All of them glow like an oven, they devour their rulers. All their kings have fallen. There is none among them who calls to me.
028	HOS	007	008	Ephraim – he lets himself be mixed among the peoples, Ephraim – he has become a cake unturned.
028	HOS	007	009	Strangers have devoured his strength, but he does not know it. His hair is sprinkled with grey, but he does not notice.
028	HOS	007	010	Israel’s arrogance testifies against them yet they do not return to the Lord their God, and in all this they do not seek him.
028	HOS	007	011	Ephraim is like a simple, silly dove: to Egypt they call, after Assyria they go,
028	HOS	007	012	wherever they turn I will spread my net over them, like birds of the sky I will bring them down, I will catch them when I hear them gathering.
028	HOS	007	013	Woe to them, for they have strayed from me! Destruction to them, for they have been untrue to me. Although it was I who redeemed them, they speak lies about me.
028	HOS	007	014	They have never cried to me with their hearts, but they are always wailing on their beds. They gather to beg for corn and new wine, but they turn away from me.
028	HOS	007	015	Although it was I who trained and strengthened their arms, concerning me they plan only evil.
028	HOS	007	016	They turn away from the Most High. They have become like a bow that swerves. Their princes will fall by the sword, because of the insolence of their tongues. The land of Egypt will mock them.
028	HOS	008	001	Put the horn to your mouth! An eagle swoops down upon the house of the Lord because they have transgressed my covenant, trespassed against my law.
028	HOS	008	002	To me they continually cry, ‘My God, we Israel, we know you!’
028	HOS	008	003	But Israel has spurned that which is good, so let the foe pursue him.
028	HOS	008	004	They themselves have made kings but without my consent. They have made princes but without my knowledge. Out of their silver and gold, they have made idols to their destruction!
028	HOS	008	005	Your calf idol, O Samaria, is distasteful. My anger is kindled against them. How long will they escape punishment?
028	HOS	008	006	Israel made the thing: a workman made it. It is not a god! Samaria’s calf will become mere splinters.
028	HOS	008	007	They sow the wind and will reap the whirlwind. A shoot which has no stalk, yields no fruit If it should yield, strangers would devour it.
028	HOS	008	008	Israel is devoured. Already it lies discarded among the nations like a worthless pot.
028	HOS	008	009	For by themselves they have gone up to Assyria like a wild donkey which wanders by itself. Ephraim pays for love
028	HOS	008	010	but even if they sell themselves among the nations, I will round them up. Soon the kings and princes will writhe under the burden of tribute!
028	HOS	008	011	For as many altars as Ephraim has erected, they are to him altars for sinning,
028	HOS	008	012	were I to write for him ever so many instructions, they would be regarded as from a stranger.
028	HOS	008	013	The people love sacrifice, and so they offer sacrifices, meat, and so they eat it, although the Lord is not pleased with them, so now he will remember their guilt, and punish their sins. Back to Egypt with them!
028	HOS	008	014	For Israel forgot his Maker and built palaces, and Judah multiplied fortified cities. But I will send fire upon her cities, and it will devour her strongholds.
028	HOS	009	001	Rejoice not too loudly, Israel, like the nations, for you have commited adultery, being untrue to your God. You have loved a prostitute’s wages on every threshing floor.
028	HOS	009	002	Threshing floor and wine vat won’t feed them, the new wine will fail them.
028	HOS	009	003	They will not stay in the Lord’s land, but Ephraim will return to Egypt, and in Assyria they will eat what is unclean.
028	HOS	009	004	They will not pour out libations of wine to the Lord, nor please him with their sacrifices. Their bread will be like the bread of mourners: all who eat it will defile themselves. For their bread will be only for their hunger, it will not come into the Lord’s temple.
028	HOS	009	005	What will you do on the day of the festival? Or on the day of the Lord’s feast?
028	HOS	009	006	Even if they flee from destruction, Egypt will gather them, Memphis will bury them. Nettles will take possession of their treasure of silver, thorns will push into their tents.
028	HOS	009	007	The days of punishment are come, the days of recompense are at hand, as soon the Israelites will know! ‘The prophet is a fool, the inspired man is raving mad!’ It is because of the greatness of your iniquity and the greatness of your hatred.
028	HOS	009	008	Ephraim acts the spy with my God, a prophet finds the snares of a fowler are in all his ways. In the house of his God they lay hostile plots,
028	HOS	009	009	they commit crimes as in the days of Gibeah, God will remember their iniquity. He will punish their sin.
028	HOS	009	010	I found Israel like finding grapes in the wilderness. I saw your ancestors like they were the first fruit on a fig tree, but as soon as they came to Baal-peor, they consecrated themselves to shamefulness, and became as abominable as the object of their love.
028	HOS	009	011	Ephraim – like a bird his glory flies away. There will be no more birth, no more motherhood, no more conception.
028	HOS	009	012	Even though they bring up their children, I will bereave them until not one is left. Woe to them when I turn away from them!
028	HOS	009	013	Ephraim – planted like Tyre in a meadow, But Ephraim too must lead forth their children to slaughter.
028	HOS	009	014	Give them, Lord – what will you give? Give them a miscarrying womb and shrivelled up breasts!
028	HOS	009	015	All their evil began in Gilgal, there I learned to hate them. Because of the evil of their deeds I will drive them out of my house. I will no longer love them, for all their princes are rebels.
028	HOS	009	016	Ephraim is blighted, their root withered. If they do bear children, I will slay the darlings of their womb,
028	HOS	009	017	My God will reject them because they have not listened to him, and they will become wanderers among the nations.
028	HOS	010	001	A luxuriant vine is Israel. He bore fruit lavishly. In proportion to the increase of his fruit he increased altars to idols. In proportion to the beauty of his land he made beautiful the sacred pillars.
028	HOS	010	002	Their heart is false, now they must be punished. God himself will break the necks of their altars, he will destroy their sacred pillars.
028	HOS	010	003	Yes, soon they will be saying, ‘We have no king, for we have not revered the Lord, and a king, what could he do for us anyway?’
028	HOS	010	004	Speaking words, perjuring themselves, making agreements, and litigation springs up like a poisonous weed in a ploughed field.
028	HOS	010	005	The inhabitants of Samaria will tremble with fear for their calf of Beth-aven. Its people will mourn over it, and so will its priests, who had rejoiced for its glory, now departed from it.
028	HOS	010	006	It will be carried off to Assyria as a present to the patron king. Disgrace will Ephraim bear and Israel will be ashamed of its idol.
028	HOS	010	007	As for Samaria, her king will disappear, like foam on the face of the waters.
028	HOS	010	008	And the high places of Aven will be destroyed, the shrines of Israel’s sin, thorns and thistles will grow on their altars, and they will say to the mountains, ‘Cover us,’ and to the hills, ‘Fall upon us.’
028	HOS	010	009	From the time of Gibeah, Israel has sinned. There they took their stand. Will not war overtake them in Gibeah because of the wicked?
028	HOS	010	010	When I please, I will punish them. Nations will gather against them to chain them for their double crimes.
028	HOS	010	011	Ephraim indeed was a trained heifer that loved to thresh grain, and I myself laid a yoke upon his fair neck, I made Ephraim draw and Judah must plough, Jacob must turn the soil for himself.
028	HOS	010	012	Sow for yourselves righteousness, reap the fruits of love. Break up your fallow ground, for it is time to seek the Lord, so righteousness may come to you.
028	HOS	010	013	But you have ploughed wickedness, iniquity have you reaped. You have eaten the fruit of lies. Because you have trusted in your own path, in the multitude of your warriors,
028	HOS	010	014	the alarm of war will sound in your cities and all your fortresses will be ruined, as Shalman laid in ruins Beth-arbel in the day of battle, when mothers were dashed to pieces over their children.
028	HOS	010	015	Thus will I do to you, Bethel, because of the enormity of your wickedness. When dawn breaks, so will the king of Israel be broken.
028	HOS	011	001	When Israel was young, then I began to love him, and out of Egypt I called my son.
028	HOS	011	002	The more I called them, the further they went away from me. They kept sacrificing to Baals and making offerings to idols.
028	HOS	011	003	Yet it was I who taught Ephraim to walk, taking them up in my arms, but they did not know that I healed them.
028	HOS	011	004	With humane cords I ever drew them, with bands of love. I was to them as one who lifts up the yoke from off their jaws, and bending toward them, I gave them food to eat.
028	HOS	011	005	No! They return to the land of Egypt, Assyria will be their king, for they have refused to return to me.
028	HOS	011	006	Therefore the swords will whirl in their cities, will devour in their fortresses.
028	HOS	011	007	For my people are bent in rebellion against me, even if they call on the Most High he will not raise them.
028	HOS	011	008	How can I give you up, Ephraim! Give you over, Israel! How am I to give you up as Admah! Make you like Zeboim! My heart asserts itself, my sympathies are all aglow.
028	HOS	011	009	I will not carry into effect the fierceness of my anger, I will not turn to destroy Ephraim, for God am I, and not man, holy in the midst of you, therefore I will not consume.
028	HOS	011	010	They will follow after the Lord. Like a lion he will roar, and when he roars his children will come trembling from the west.
028	HOS	011	011	They will come trembling like the birds from Egypt, like doves from the land of Assyria. And I will bring them back to their houses, – declares the Lord.
028	HOS	011	012	Ephraim has encompassed me with falsehood, and the house of Israel with deceit. But Judah still wanders with God faithful to the Holy One.
028	HOS	012	001	Ephraim herds the wind and hunts the sirocco. All day long they heap up falsehood and fraud, make a treaty with Assyria, and sends tribute of olive oil to Egypt.
028	HOS	012	002	The Lord has a charge to bring against Israel, to punish Jacob for his acts, according to his deeds will he requite him,
028	HOS	012	003	In the womb he supplanted his brother, in manhood he wrestled with God,
028	HOS	012	004	He wrestled with the angel and prevailed, he wept and sought his blessing. At Bethel the Lord found him, and there he spoke with us.
028	HOS	012	005	And the Lord is the God of hosts, the Lord is his name!
028	HOS	012	006	So now, by the help of your God, return. Keep true love and justice. Trust in your God without ceasing.
028	HOS	012	007	A merchant uses false scales: They love to defraud.
028	HOS	012	008	Ephraim says, ‘Yes, I have become rich, I have secured wealth for myself. But despite my gains no one will find a crime I can be convicted of!’
028	HOS	012	009	I am the Lord your God, ever since the land of Egypt. I will make you again dwell in tents, as in days of old.
028	HOS	012	010	I spoke continually by the prophets. It was I who multiplied visions, and spoke in parables through the prophets.
028	HOS	012	011	In Gilead is iniquity, they will come to nothing. In Gilgal they sacrifice bulls, so their altars will be as stone heaps, among the furrows of the field.
028	HOS	012	012	And Jacob fled to the territory of Aram, and Israel worked to earn a wife: for a wife he herded sheep.
028	HOS	012	013	The Lord brought Israel up from Egypt by a prophet, and by a prophet Israel was guarded.
028	HOS	012	014	Ephraim has given bitter provocation. His Lord will leave upon him his guilt of bloodshed, and for his contempt he will repay him.
028	HOS	013	001	When Ephraim used to speak there was trembling; a prince was he in Israel. But he incurred guilt through Baal and died.
028	HOS	013	002	And now they go on sinning. They make for themselves molten gods – idols of silver, skilfully made, wholly the work of smiths. Yet to such they sacrifice! And they who sacrifice kiss calf idols!
028	HOS	013	003	Therefore they will be like the morning mist, like the dew that early disappears, like the chaff which blows away from the threshing floor, like the smoke from the window.
028	HOS	013	004	Yet it was I, the Lord your God, ever since the land of Egypt, you know no other god but me, nor has there been any saviour except me.
028	HOS	013	005	It was I who shepherded you in the wilderness, in the land of burning heat.
028	HOS	013	006	When they were pastured they became full, when they were full their hearts became proud. Therefore they forgot me!
028	HOS	013	007	So now I will be to them like a lion, like a leopard will I lay in wait by the path.
028	HOS	013	008	I will fall upon them like a bear robbed of her cubs, I will tear open their chests, like a lion will devour them, and like a wild beast will tear them in pieces.
028	HOS	013	009	You are destroyed, Israel, by me, your only helper.
028	HOS	013	010	I want to rule you! Where are your princes in your cities, those of whom you demanded, ‘Give me kings and princes.’
028	HOS	013	011	I give you kings in my anger, and take them away in my wrath.
028	HOS	013	012	Ephrahn’s iniquity is gathered up, his sin is laid by in store.
028	HOS	013	013	The pangs of childbirth come upon him, but he is an unwise child. For this is no time to refuse to leave the womb!
028	HOS	013	014	Should I deliver them from the power of Sheol? Should I redeem them from death? Death, where are your plagues? Sheol, where is your pestilence? Compassion is forever hidden from my eyes.
028	HOS	013	015	Though he is flourishing among his brothers, there will come an east wind, the Lord’s wind, coming up from the wilderness. His fountain will dry up, his spring will be parched. The wind will strip the treasury, all the precious things.
028	HOS	013	016	Samaria will bear her guilt, for she has rebelled against her God. They will fall by the sword, their children dashed to pieces, their pregnant women ripped open.
028	HOS	014	001	Return, Israel, to the Lord your God, for you have stumbled in your iniquity.
028	HOS	014	002	Take words of repentance with you, and return to the Lord your God. Say to him: Wholly pardon our iniquity, accept that which is good, instead of sacrificing bulls, we offer our praise.
028	HOS	014	003	Assyria will not save us, nor Egyptian warhorses, and we will no more call the work of our hands our gods. For in you orphan Israel finds mercy.
028	HOS	014	004	‘I will heal their apostasy, I will love them freely, now that my anger is turned away from them,
028	HOS	014	005	I will be as dew to Israel. He will blossom like the lily, he will plant his roots like the cedars of Lebanon,
028	HOS	014	006	his saplings will spread out, his beauty will be like that of the olive tree, his fragrance like the cedars of Lebanon.
028	HOS	014	007	People will return and dwell in my shade, they will bring life to new grain. They will sprout like the vine, and their renown will be like that of the wine of Lebanon.
028	HOS	014	008	Ephraim – what have I to do with idols! It is I the Lord who respond to him and look after him. I am like an evergreen cypress, from me is your fruit found.
028	HOS	014	009	Whoever is wise, let him discern these things, prudent, let him perceive them; For the Lord’s ways are straight, and the righteous walk in them, but the wicked stumble in them.

029	JOE	001	005	Awake, drunkards, and weep, and wail, all drinkers of wine; the new wine is cut off from your mouth.
029	JOE	001	006	For a nation has come up on my land, powerful, and numberless; its teeth are the teeth of a lion, and its jaw-teeth are like those of a lioness.
029	JOE	001	007	It has laid waste my vines, and barked my fig tree; it has peeled and cast it away, bleached are the branches.
029	JOE	001	008	Wail as a bride, clad in sack-cloth, for the husband of her youth.
029	JOE	001	009	Cut off are the cereal and drink-offerings from the house of the Lord; in mourning are the priests, who minister at the Lord’s altar.
029	JOE	001	010	The fields are blasted, the land is in mourning, for ruined is the corn, the new wine fails and the oil is dried up.
029	JOE	001	011	Be dismayed, farmers; wail, vine-dressers. For the wheat and the barley; for the harvest is lost from the fields.
029	JOE	001	012	The vine fails to bear fruit, and the fig tree is drooping; the pomegranate, palm, and apple, all the trees of the field are dried up. The people’s joy withers.
029	JOE	001	013	Put on sackcloth, and beat your breasts, priests; wail, ministers of the altar; come, lie all night in sack-cloth, ministers of God; for cereal-offering and drink-offering are cut off from the house of your God.
029	JOE	001	014	Sanctify a fast, summon an assembly, gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land into the house of the Lord your God, cry to the Lord:
029	JOE	001	015	Alas for the day! Near at hand is the day of the Lord, and as destruction from the Almighty it comes.
029	JOE	001	016	Is not food cut off from before us, gladness and joy from the house of our God?
029	JOE	001	017	The grains shrivel under their hoes, the storehouses are desolate, the barns broken down, for the corn is withered.
029	JOE	001	018	How the herds of cattle bellow in distress, for they have no pasture! The flocks of sheep are forlorn.
029	JOE	001	019	To you, the Lord, I cry. For fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness, and flame has scorched all the trees of the field.
029	JOE	001	020	The wild animals also look up to you longingly, for the water-courses are dried up, and fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness.
029	JOE	002	001	Blow a horn in Zion, sound an alarm in my holy mountain, let all the inhabitants of the land tremble, for the day of the Lord comes, for near is
029	JOE	002	002	the day of darkness and gloom, the day of cloud and thick darkness! Like the light of dawn scattered over the mountains, a people great and powerful; its like has not been from of old, neither will be any more after it, even to the years of coming ages.
029	JOE	002	003	Before them the fire devours, and behind them a flame burns; like the garden of Eden is the land before them, and after them it is a desolate desert, nothing escapes them.
029	JOE	002	004	Their appearance is as the appearance of horses, and like horsemen they charge.
029	JOE	002	005	Like the sound of chariots on the tops of the mountains they leap, like the crackle of flames devouring stubble, like a mighty people preparing for battle.
029	JOE	002	006	Peoples are in anguish before them, all faces grow pale.
029	JOE	002	007	Like mighty men they run, like warriors they mount up a wall, they march each by himself, they break not their ranks,
029	JOE	002	008	none jostles the other. They march each in his path. They fall upon the weapons without breaking.
029	JOE	002	009	They scour the city, they run on the wall. They climb up into the houses. Like a thief they enter the windows.
029	JOE	002	010	Earth trembles before them, the sky quakes, the sun and moon become dark, and the stars withdraw their shining;
029	JOE	002	011	and the Lord utters his voice before his army, for his host is exceedingly great. Mighty is he who performs his word. For great is the day of the Lord, it is terrible, who can endure it?
029	JOE	002	012	But now this is the message of the Lord: Turn to me with all your heart, and with fasting and weeping and mourning,
029	JOE	002	013	rend your hearts and not your garments, and turn to the Lord your God; for he indeed is gracious and merciful, slow to anger and plenteous in love, and relents of the evil.
029	JOE	002	014	Who knows but he will turn and relent, and leave a blessing behind him, a cereal and drink-offering for the Lord your God.
029	JOE	002	015	Blow a horn in Zion, sanctify a fast, summon an assembly,
029	JOE	002	016	gather the people, make holy the congregation, assemble the elders, gather the children, and the infants at the breast. Let the bridegroom come forth from his chamber, and the bride from her bridal tent.
029	JOE	002	017	Between the porch and the altar, let the priests, the ministers of the Lord weep aloud, let them say: Spare, the Lord, your people. Make not your heritage an object of reproach, for the heathen to mock them. Why should it be said among the nations, “Where is their God?”
029	JOE	002	018	Then the Lord became deeply concerned for his land, and took pity upon his people,
029	JOE	002	019	and the Lord answered and said to his people: I will send you corn, wine, and oil. You will be satisfied. I will not make you again an object of scorn among the nations,
029	JOE	002	020	I will remove far from you the northern foe, and I will drive it into a land barren and desolate, its front into the eastern sea, and its rear to the western sea. And from it a stench will arise. He has done great things!
029	JOE	002	021	Fear not, land, exult. Rejoice for the Lord has done great things!
029	JOE	002	022	Fear not, animals of the field. For the pastures of the wilderness are putting forth new grass, for the trees bear their fruit, fig tree and vine yield full harvest.
029	JOE	002	023	Be glad, then, children of Zion, and rejoice in the Lord your God, for he has given you the early rain in just measure, and poured down upon you the winter rain, and sent the latter rain as before.
029	JOE	002	024	The threshing floors will be full of grain, and the vats will overflow with new wine and oil.
029	JOE	002	025	I will repay you for the years which the swarming locust has eaten. The hopping, the destroying, and the cutting locusts, my great army which I sent among you, and my people will never again be put to shame.
029	JOE	002	026	You will eat your food and be satisfied, and praise the name of the Lord your God, who has dealt so wonderfully by you,
029	JOE	002	027	and you will know that I am in the midst of Israel, that I am the Lord your God and none else, and my people will never again be put to shame.
029	JOE	002	028	Afterwards, I will pour out my spirit on everyone. Your sons and your daughters will prophesy, your old men will dream dreams. Your young men will see visions,
029	JOE	002	029	and even on your male and female slaves in those days, I will pour out my spirit.
029	JOE	002	030	And I will show signs in the sky and on earth: Blood and fire and pillars of smoke.
029	JOE	002	031	The sun will be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood before the coming of the great and terrible day of the Lord.
029	JOE	002	032	But whoever will call upon the name of the Lord will be saved. For in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there will be those who escape, even as the Lord has said, and among the fugitives those whom the Lord calls.
029	JOE	003	001	For, in those days and in that time, when I bring back again the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem,
029	JOE	003	002	I will also gather all the nations and bring them down into the Valley of Jehoshaphat, and there I will enter into judgment with them for my people and my heritage Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations, and divided my land.
029	JOE	003	003	They have cast lots for my people. They have traded boys for prostitutes, and sold girls for wine, and drunk it.
029	JOE	003	004	What are you to me, Tyre and Sidon and all the districts of Philistia? Were you repaying any deed of mine, or were you doing something for me? Quickly will I return your deed upon your heads.
029	JOE	003	005	You who have taken my silver and my gold, and you have brought my goodly jewels into your palaces,
029	JOE	003	006	you have sold the people of Judah and of Jerusalem to the Greeks, so that you might remove them far from their own borders.
029	JOE	003	007	I am about to stir them up from the place to which you have sold them, and I will turn your deeds upon your own head.
029	JOE	003	008	I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hands of the people of Judah, and they will sell them to the Sabeans, to a nation far off, for the Lord has spoken.
029	JOE	003	009	Proclaim this among the nations, sanctify war. Arouse the warriors, let all the fighting men muster and go up.
029	JOE	003	010	Beat your ploughshares into swords, and your pruning-hooks into lances; let the weak say, I, indeed, am strong.
029	JOE	003	011	Bestir yourselves and come, all you nations round about. Quickly gather yourselves together, ask the Lord to bring his warriors.
029	JOE	003	012	Let the nations rouse themselves and come up to the Valley of Jehoshaphat, for there will I sit to judge all the surrounding nations.
029	JOE	003	013	Put in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe; go in, tread, for the wine press is full. The vats overflow, for great is their wickedness.
029	JOE	003	014	Noisy multitudes, noisy multitudes in the valley of decision. For near is the Lord’s day in the valley of decision!
029	JOE	003	015	Sun and moon have turned dark, and the stars withdrawn their shining.
029	JOE	003	016	Whenever the Lord roars from Zion and utters his voice from Jerusalem, earth and sky quake; but the Lord is a refuge to his people, and a fortress to the people of Israel.
029	JOE	003	017	And you will know that I am the Lord your God, I who dwells in Zion, my holy mountain, and Jerusalem will be holy, and strangers will not pass through her any more.
029	JOE	003	018	In that day, the mountains will drop sweet wine, the hills will flow with milk, all the channels of Judah will flow with water, a fountain will spring from the house of Judah, and will water the Valley of Shittim.
029	JOE	003	019	Egypt will become a desolation, and Edom a wilderness, because of the violence done to the people of Judah, because they shed innocent blood in their land,
029	JOE	003	020	Judah will remain inhabited forever, and Jerusalem from generation to generation.
029	JOE	003	021	I will avenge their blood which I have not yet avenged. The Lord lives in Zion!

# BOOK	030	AMO	Amos	Amos
030	AMO	001	001	The message of Amos, one of the sheep breeders of Tekoa, which he saw concerning Israel in the reign of King Uzziah of Judah, and in the reign of Jeroboam the son of King Joash of Israel, two years before the earthquake.
030	AMO	001	002	Amos said: Whenever the Lord roars from Zion, and utters his voice from Jerusalem, the pastures of the shepherds dry up, the top of Carmel becomes arid.
030	AMO	001	003	The Lord says: For Damascus’ three crimes – no, four! – I will not rescind my judgment. They have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron.
030	AMO	001	004	Therefore I will send fire on Hazael’s house, it will devour the palaces of Ben-hadad.
030	AMO	001	005	I will break open the gate of Damascus, I will wipe out those who live in the valley of Aven and the sceptred ruler of Beth-Eden. The people of Aram will go into captivity in Kir, says the Lord.
030	AMO	001	006	The Lord says: For Gaza’s three crimes – no, four! – I will not rescind my judgment. They carried away captive a whole nation, sold them as slaves to Edom.
030	AMO	001	007	Therefore I will send fire on the wall of Gaza, and it will devour her palaces.
030	AMO	001	008	And I will wipe out those who live in Ashdod, and the sceptred ruler of Askelon. I will turn my hand against Ekron, and the remnant of the Philistines will perish, says the Lord.
030	AMO	001	009	The Lord says: For Tyre’s three crimes – no, four! – I will not rescind my judgment. They carried away captive a whole people into exile in Edom, and did not remember the brotherly covenant.
030	AMO	001	010	So I will send fire on the walls of Tyre. It will devour her palaces.
030	AMO	001	011	The Lord says: For Edom’s three crimes – no, four! – I will not rescind my judgment. They pursued their relatives with the sword, stilled their pity, cherished their anger continually, retained their fury forever.
030	AMO	001	012	So I will send a fire into Teman. It will destroy the palaces of Bozrah.
030	AMO	001	013	The Lord says: For Ammonites’ three crimes – no, four! – I will not rescind my judgment. They have ripped open pregnant women in Gilead, in their lust for land.
030	AMO	001	014	So I will kindle a fire on the wall of Rabbah. It will destroy her palaces, with a war-cry in the day of battle, with a tempest in the day of the whirlwind.
030	AMO	001	015	Their king will go into exile, he and his nobles together, says the Lord.
030	AMO	002	001	The Lord says: For Moab’s three crimes – no, four! – I will not rescind my judgment. They have burned to lime the bones of the king of Edom,
030	AMO	002	002	to desecrate the dead. So I will send a fire into Moab. It will devour the palaces of Kirioth, with a war-cry, with the sound of trumpets.
030	AMO	002	003	I will kill the ruler, all his nobles I will slay with him, says the Lord.
030	AMO	002	004	The Lord says: For Judah’s three crimes – no, four! – I will not rescind my judgment. They have rejected the law of the Lord and have not kept his statutes. Instead their false gods their ancestors followed, have led them astray.
030	AMO	002	005	So I will send a fire on Judah. It will devour the palaces of Jerusalem.
030	AMO	002	006	The Lord says: For Israel’s three crimes – no, four! – I will not rescind my judgment. They sell the righteous for money, the needy for a pair of shoes.
030	AMO	002	007	They trample on the head of the poor, push the humble out of the way. Father and son go to the same temple girl, and so profane my holy name.
030	AMO	002	008	They stretch themselves on garments taken in pledges beside every altar, and they drink the wine of those who have been fined in the house of their God.
030	AMO	002	009	It was I who destroyed the Amorites for your sake, whose height was like that of the cedars, as strong as oaks. I destroyed their fruit from above and their roots from below.
030	AMO	002	010	It was I who brought you up from the land of Egypt, led you forty years in the wilderness, brought you here to possess the land of the Amorites.
030	AMO	002	011	I raised up some of your sons to be prophets some of your youths to be Nazirites. Is not this indeed so, Israelites? says the Lord.
030	AMO	002	012	But you made the Nazirites drink wine and banned the prophets from prophesying.
030	AMO	002	013	Listen! It is I who will make you groan in your places, as a wagon groans under its load of grain.
030	AMO	002	014	Then flight will fail the swift, and the strength of the strongest will be useless. The warrior will not save his life,
030	AMO	002	015	the archer will not stand firm, the swift of foot will not escape, the horseman will not save his life.
030	AMO	002	016	The bravest of warriors will flee away naked in that day, says the Lord.
030	AMO	003	001	Listen to this message, Israelites, which the Lord has spoken against you, against the whole nation that I brought out of Egypt:
030	AMO	003	002	You alone have I cared for of all the nations of the world, this is why I will punish you for your crimes.
030	AMO	003	003	Do two walk together unless they agreed to meet?
030	AMO	003	004	Does a lion roar in the forest when there is no prey for him? Does a young lion cry out in his den unless he has caught something?
030	AMO	003	005	Does a bird swoop down into a trap if no bait is set for it? Does a trap spring up from the ground if nothing sets it off?
030	AMO	003	006	Can a trumpet be blown in a city and the people not tremble? Can disaster strike a city and the Lord not have caused it?
030	AMO	003	007	Surely the Lord God does nothing without revealing his purpose to his servants the prophets.
030	AMO	003	008	The lion has roared; who does not fear? The Lord God has spoken; who will not prophesy?
030	AMO	003	009	Proclaim over the palaces in Ashdod, and over the palaces in the land of Egypt: Gather upon the mountain of Samaria, and see the violent turmoil, the acts of oppression in her midst.
030	AMO	003	010	For they do not know how to do right. They are heaping up violence and oppression in their palaces, says the Lord.
030	AMO	003	011	Therefore the Lord God says: An enemy will surround the land, he will strip your strength from you. and your palaces will be looted.
030	AMO	003	012	The Lord says: Just as a shepherd rescues from the jaws of a lion two shinbones or a piece of an ear, so the Israelites living in Sameria will be rescued – with the corner of a couch, and the damask of a divan!
030	AMO	003	013	Listen and testify against the house of Jacob, says the Lord God, the God of hosts.
030	AMO	003	014	On the day when I punish Israel for their crimes, I will also visit in judgment the altars of Bethel, the horns of the altar will be hacked off, and they will fall to the ground.
030	AMO	003	015	I will destroy the winter houses together with the summer houses and the houses of ivory will perish. Many great houses will be swept away, says the Lord.
030	AMO	004	001	Listen to this message, women of Sameria, you well-fed cows of Bashan, who oppress the poor and crush the needy, who say to your husbands, ‘Bring us another drink!’
030	AMO	004	002	The Lord God has sworn by his holiness: The time is coming when you will be carried away in baskets, your children carried away in fish-baskets,
030	AMO	004	003	and through the breaches in the city wall you will go, thrown out on the garbage dump, says the Lord.
030	AMO	004	004	Come to Bethel and transgress, at Gilgald increase your transgression. Bring your sacrifices in the morning, every third day your tithes!
030	AMO	004	005	Burn some leavened bread as a thank-offering, proclaim aloud your voluntary offerings, for you love to do this, Israelites! says the Lord God.
030	AMO	004	006	But it was I who gave to you empty stomachs in all your cities, and lack of bread in all your towns, yet you have not returned to me, says the Lord.
030	AMO	004	007	It was I who withheld from you the rain, sending rain on one city, while on another I allowed no rain. One field received rain, while a field without rain withered.
030	AMO	004	008	People from two or three cities ranged as far as another city for drinking water, and still they did not have enough, yet you did not return to me, says the Lord.
030	AMO	004	009	I struck you with blight and mildew, I laid waste your gardens and vineyards. The swarming locust devoured your fig and your olive trees, yet you did not return to me, says the Lord.
030	AMO	004	010	I sent plague among you like the plagues of Egypt, I slew your youths with the sword, your horses raided away, I caused the stench of your camps to rise in your nostrils, yet you did not return to me, says the Lord.
030	AMO	004	011	I wrought a destruction among you, as God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah. You were like a stick snatched from the fire, yet you did not return to me, says the Lord.
030	AMO	004	012	Therefore this is what I will do to you, Israel, and because I am about to do this to you, prepare to meet your God, Israel.
030	AMO	004	013	He is here! He who forms the mountains, creates the wind, declares to his thoughts to mortals, makes dawn and darkness, treads upon the heights of the earth, the Lord, the God of hosts, is his name!
030	AMO	005	001	Listen to the words of the funeral song I am singing for you, Israel:
030	AMO	005	002	Fallen, no more to rise, is the virgin Israel! Hurled down upon her own soil she lies, with no one to lift her up!
030	AMO	005	003	For the Lord God says this: The city that marches out with a thousand soldiers has only a hundred left, and the one that marches out with a hundred has only ten left.
030	AMO	005	004	For the Lord says this to Israel: Seek me and live,
030	AMO	005	005	But do not seek Bethel, do not enter Gilgal, do not go over to Beer-sheba. For Gilgal will enter exile, and Bethel will go to destruction.
030	AMO	005	006	Seek the Lord and live, or he will cast fire on the house of Joseph, and it will devour and there will be no one to quench it for Bethel.
030	AMO	005	007	You who turn judgment to bitter wormwood, and cast righteousness into the dirt:
030	AMO	005	008	He who made the Pleiades and Orion, who turns deep darkness into dawn, who darkens day again into night, who summons the waters of the sea, and pours them out on the earth’s surface, the Lord is his name!
030	AMO	005	009	He causes destruction to burst over the strong. He brings devastation on the fortress.
030	AMO	005	010	You who hate the arbiters at the city gate, and abhor anyone who speaks the truth:
030	AMO	005	011	Because you trample on the weak, and tax their grain, although you have built houses of hewn stone, you will not live in them, although you have planted charming vineyards, you will not drink their wine.
030	AMO	005	012	For I know how many are your crimes, and how great are your sins! You persecutors of the righteous, takers of bribes! You deny the poor their justice at the city gate.
030	AMO	005	013	It would be wise to keep quiet in such an evil time.
030	AMO	005	014	Seek good and not evil, that you may live, so the Lord, God of hosts, may be with you, as you have claimed he is.
030	AMO	005	015	Hate evil and love good, establish justice at the city gate. Perhaps the Lord, the God of hosts, will be gracious to a surviving remnant of Joseph.
030	AMO	005	016	Therefore the Lord, the God of hosts, says: In all the public squares there will be wailing, in every street the sound of mourning. They will summon the farmers to mourning, and professional mourners to wailing.
030	AMO	005	017	In all vineyards there will be lamenting, when I pass through your midst, says the Lord.
030	AMO	005	018	Fools who long for the day of the Lord! What does the day of the Lord mean to you? It is darkness, and not light.
030	AMO	005	019	It is as when one flees from a lion, and is attacked by a bear, as when one reaches home, leans his hand on the wall, and a snake bites him.
030	AMO	005	020	Won’t the Lord’s day be darkness and not light, murky darkness without a ray of light in it?
030	AMO	005	021	I hate, I despise your feasts, I will not smell the savour of your festivals,
030	AMO	005	022	I will not be pleased with your burnt offerings, your grain offerings, I will not accept the peace offerings of your fattened calves.
030	AMO	005	023	Spare me the noise of your songs, I will not listen to the melody of your lyres.
030	AMO	005	024	But let justice roll on as a flood of waters, and righteousness like an unfailing stream.
030	AMO	005	025	Was it only sacrifices and grain offerings you brought me during the forty years in the wilderness, Israel?
030	AMO	005	026	But now you will lift up your “king” Sikkuth and “star god” Kiyyun, your idols which you have made for yourselves,
030	AMO	005	027	as I drive you into exile beyond Damascus, says the Lord, whose name is the God of hosts.
030	AMO	006	001	Sorrow awaits who are carefree in Zion, overconfident on the mountain of Samaria! The elite of this, the best of nations, on whom the people of Israel rest their hopes!
030	AMO	006	002	You say to the people: Cross over to Calneh and see, go from there to Hamath the great, then go down to Gath of the Philistines: Are they better than these kingdoms? Is their territory larger than yours?
030	AMO	006	003	You push away all thoughts of the evil day, yet have instituted a rule of violence.
030	AMO	006	004	They lie on ivory couches, sprawl on their divans, eat choice lambs from the flock, and fattened calves from the stall.
030	AMO	006	005	They idly sing to the sound of the lyre, thinking themselves songwriters like David,
030	AMO	006	006	they drink bowlfuls of wine, and anoint themselves with the finest of oil. But they do not grieve over the ruin of Joseph.
030	AMO	006	007	Therefore now they must go into exile at the head of the captives, and hushed will be the revelry of the sprawlers.
030	AMO	006	008	The Lord God, the Lord, the God of hosts, has sworn by himself: I abhor the pride of Jacob, I hate his palaces, therefore I will deliver up the city and all that is in it to their enemies.
030	AMO	006	009	If ten people remain in one house, then they will die.
030	AMO	006	010	When the uncle and another member of the family of a dead man come to carry the body out of the house for burial, they will call to someone in a corner of the house, “Any more there?” and he will answer, “No”, and then he will add, “Be quiet!” – for the name of the Lord must not be mentioned.
030	AMO	006	011	Look! The Lord is giving the command! He will smash the large house to bits, the small house into fragments.
030	AMO	006	012	Do horses gallop on crags? Does one plough the sea with oxen? Yet you turn justice into poison weed, and the fruit of righteousness into bitter wormwood.
030	AMO	006	013	You who are so proud of capturing Lo-debar, who say, “Have we not by our own strength taken Karnaim for ourselves?”
030	AMO	006	014	I am now raising up against you, Israel, a nation, says the Lord, the God of hosts. They will oppress you, from the entrance of Hamath to the brook of the Arabah.
030	AMO	007	001	This is what the Lord God showed me: he was forming a swarm of locusts, when the late spring grass began to come up after the king’s share had been harvested.
030	AMO	007	002	And when they had finished devouring all the land’s vegetation, I said: ‘Lord God, forgive, I beg you! How can Jacob survive, for he is so helpless?’
030	AMO	007	003	The Lord relented. This will not happen,’ said the Lord.
030	AMO	007	004	This is what he showed me: the Lord God was giving command to execute judgment by fire. It burned up the great deep, and had begun to devour the fields, and I said:
030	AMO	007	005	‘Lord God, forgive, I beg you! How can Jacob survive, for he is so helpless?’
030	AMO	007	006	The Lord relented. ‘This will not happen either,’ said the Lord.
030	AMO	007	007	This is what the Lord God showed me: the Lord was standing beside a wall built with a plumb line, with a plumb line in his hand.
030	AMO	007	008	And the Lord said to me, ‘What do you see, Amos?’ And I answered, ‘A plumb line,’ Then the Lord said, ‘Watch: I am setting a plumb line in the midst of my people Israel, I will no longer overlook their crookedness.
030	AMO	007	009	And the high places of Isaac will be desolate, the sanctuaries of Israel will be laid waste, and I will rise up against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.’
030	AMO	007	010	Then Amaziah, chief priest of Bethel sent this message to King Jeroboam of Israel: ‘Amos has conspired against you right in the heart of Israel. The country cannot survive all his words.
030	AMO	007	011	Amos has said, “Jeroboam will die by the sword, and Israel will be led away captive out of their land.”’
030	AMO	007	012	And Amaziah said to Amos, ‘Leave, you who see visions, go to the land of Judah. Earn your bread there and prophesy there,
030	AMO	007	013	but don’t prophesy any more at Bethel, for it is the king’s sanctuary, and it is the royal residence.’
030	AMO	007	014	‘I am no prophet,’ Amos answered Amaziah, ‘nor trained as one. I am a shepherd and a keeper of sycamores fig trees.
030	AMO	007	015	But the Lord took me away from following the flock, and the Lord said to me, “Go, prophesy to my people Israel.”
030	AMO	007	016	Now therefore listen to the Lord’s message: “You say not to prophesy against Israel, nor to preach against the house of Isaac.
030	AMO	007	017	But the Lord says: Your wife will become a prostitute in the city, your sons and your daughters will fall by the sword, your land will be divided up, you will die on unclean soil, and Israel will be led away captive out of their land.”’
030	AMO	008	001	The Lord God showed me this: a basket of summer fruit.
030	AMO	008	002	‘What do you see, Amos?’ he asked. I replied, ‘A basket of ripe summer fruit.’ Then the Lord said to me: The time is ripe for my people Israel, I will no longer overlook their crimes.
030	AMO	008	003	The singing women in the palace will howl on that day, says the Lord: Corpses everywhere, thrown out in silence.
030	AMO	008	004	Listen to this, you who trample on the needy, who oppress the poor of the earth,
030	AMO	008	005	saying: When will the feast of the new moon be over so that we may sell grain? And the sabbath ended so that we may offer wheat for sale? Reducing the measure and increasing the price, cheating with false scales,
030	AMO	008	006	mixing the sweepings in with the wheat. Then we can buy the poor for money, the needy for a pair of shoes.
030	AMO	008	007	Now the Lord has taken an oath by the Pride of Jacob: I will never forget all their deeds!
030	AMO	008	008	Because of this won’t the land quake, and all its inhabitants mourn? Won’t the whole of it rise like the Nile, churn and subside like the Nile in Egypt?
030	AMO	008	009	On that day, says the Lord God, I will make the sun set at noon and darken the earth in broad daylight.
030	AMO	008	010	I will turn your feasts into mourning, all your songs into dirges. I will cause you to dress in sackcloth, every head shaved. I will make you mourn like you have lost your only son, all that happens will end in bitterness.
030	AMO	008	011	The day is coming, says the Lord God, when I will send hunger in the land. Not a famine of bread or thirst for water, but for hearing the message of the Lord.
030	AMO	008	012	Then they will wander from sea to sea, from the north to the east, to seek a message from the Lord, but they will not find it.
030	AMO	008	013	In that day beautiful girls and strong young men will faint from thirst.
030	AMO	008	014	Those who take oaths by the shameful idol of Samaria, who swear, “As surely as your God lives, O Dan!” and, “By the sacred way to Beer-sheba!” – they will fall and never rise again.
030	AMO	009	001	I saw the Lord towering above the altar, and he commanded: Strike the tops of the pillars so that the foundations may shake, bring them down on the heads of the people below. The rest of them I will slay with the sword: no one will get away, no one will escape.
030	AMO	009	002	If they dig down to Sheol, there will my hand take them. If they climb up to the heavens, from there will I bring them down.
030	AMO	009	003	If they hide themselves on the top of Carmel, there will I search them out and take them. If they hide out of my sight at the bottom of the sea, there will I command the sea serpent to bite them.
030	AMO	009	004	If they are taken into captivity by their enemies, there will I command the sword to slay them. I will keep my eye on them but for evil and not for good.
030	AMO	009	005	It is the Lord the God of hosts, who touches the earth and it trembles, all who live on it mourn. The earth rises up like the Nile, and sinks like the Nile of Egypt.
030	AMO	009	006	The one who builds in the heavens, who sets the dome of the sky over the earth, who summons the waters of the sea and pours them out on the face of the earth: the Lord is his name.
030	AMO	009	007	To me, Israelites, you are just like the Cushites, says the Lord. Yes, I brought Israel up out of the land of Egypt, but also the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Arameans from Kir!
030	AMO	009	008	Behold the eyes of the Lord God are on the sinful kingdom: I will destroy it from the face of the earth! But I will not completely destroy the house of Jacob, says the Lord.
030	AMO	009	009	For behold I am about to give the command, and I will shake the house of Israel among all the nations just as one shakes grain in a sieve, but not a pebble will fall to the ground.
030	AMO	009	010	All the sinners of my people, who deny that disaster will touch or befall them, will die by the sword.
030	AMO	009	011	On that day I will raise up the fallen house of David, I will wall up its gaps and raise up its ruins, I will rebuild it as it was long ago.
030	AMO	009	012	They will possess again the rest of Edom, and all the nations which once you ruled for me, says the Lord, who will do this.
030	AMO	009	013	Listen! The days are coming, says the Lord, when the harvest is too big to reap before it is time to plough, when the grapes cannot be all trod before it is time to sow, when the mountains will run with sweet wine, and every hill will flow with it.
030	AMO	009	014	I will bring back my people Israel, they will rebuild waste cities and inhabit them, plant vineyards and drink their wine, make gardens and eat their fruit.
030	AMO	009	015	I will plant them on their own soil, and they will never again be uprooted from their land which I have given them, says the Lord your God.

# BOOK	031	OBA	Obadiah	Obadiah
031	OBA	001	001	The vision of Obadiah; what the Lord said about Edom: We have heard a report from the Lord, a messenger has been sent among the nations; Rise up, let us rise against Edom in battle!
031	OBA	001	002	I will make you small among the nations, and despised by all!
031	OBA	001	003	Your proud heart has misled you, you who live in the clefts of the rock, you who build on high your dwelling. You say to yourselves, “Who can bring me down to earth?”
031	OBA	001	004	Though you build high as the eagle, though between the stars you set your nest, from there will I bring you down, says the Lord.
031	OBA	001	005	If thieves had come to you, marauders by night would they not have stolen only as much as they needed? If grape-gatherers had come to you would they not have left some gleanings?
031	OBA	001	006	Descendents of Esau, all your treasures are looted.
031	OBA	001	007	To your border they have driven you, all your allies have betrayed you. Your avowed friends have overpowered you, they have set a trap for you. Where is your wisdom now?
031	OBA	001	008	The Lord says: On that day, I will destroy the wise of Edom, drive wisdom out of Mount Esau.
031	OBA	001	009	Your warriors will be filled with terror, Teman, none will be left alive on Mount Esau.
031	OBA	001	010	Because of the violence done to your relatives, the people of Jacob, shame covers you, you are cut off forever.
031	OBA	001	011	In the day when you stood aloof, in the day when strangers carried away their wealth, and strangers entered into their gates, and over Jerusalem cast lots, you were as one of those strangers.
031	OBA	001	012	You should not have gloated over your relatives, in the day of their misfortune. You should not have exulted over the land of Judah in the day of their destruction. You should not have laughed loudly at their distress.
031	OBA	001	013	You should not have entered in at the gate of my people in the day of their disaster. You should not have gloated over their calamity, in the day of their disaster, nor stretched out your hand after their wealth in the day of their disaster,
031	OBA	001	014	nor stood at the crossroads to cut down their fugitives, nor should you have betrayed their refugees in the day of distress.
031	OBA	001	015	Near at hand is the Lord’s day for all the nations. As you have done so will it be done to you. Your deeds will come back on your own head.
031	OBA	001	016	As you have drunk upon my holy mountain, so all the nations will drink in turn; They will drink deep and be as though they had not been.
031	OBA	001	017	But on Mount Zion some will escape, it will be again holy, and those of the house of Jacob will again enter into their possessions.
031	OBA	001	018	For the house of Jacob will be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, but the house of Esau will become stubble. They will kindle and devour it. Not even one of the house of Esau will escape, for the Lord has spoken.
031	OBA	001	019	They will possess the Negeb and Mount Esau, and the Shephelah of the Philistines. They will possess the territory of Ephraim and Samaria, and Benjamin will possess Gilead.
031	OBA	001	020	The exiles of Israel will possess the land of the Canaanites as far as Zarephath. The captives of Jerusalem who are in Sepharad will possess the cities of the Negreb.
031	OBA	001	021	The rescued will come up on Mount Zion to rule Mount Esau, and the kingdom will belong to the Lord.

# BOOK	032	JON	Jonah	Jonah
032	JON	001	001	This message from the Lord came to Jonah, the son of Amittai:
032	JON	001	002	‘Arise, go to that great city, Nineveh, and preach against it; for their wickedness is known to me.’
032	JON	001	003	But Jonah started to flee to Tarshish from the presence of the Lord. He went down to Joppa and found a ship going to Tarshish. So he paid the fare and went aboard to go with them to Tarshish from the presence of the Lord.
032	JON	001	004	But the Lord made a furious wind blow over the sea, and there was such a great storm that the ship was in danger of breaking to pieces.
032	JON	001	005	The sailors were terrified and each cried for help to his own god. They threw the ship’s cargo into the sea to make the ship lighter. Meanwhile Jonah had gone down into the bottom of the ship and lay fast asleep.
032	JON	001	006	The captain of the ship went and said to him, ‘How can you sleep? Call on your god; perhaps that god will think of us, so that we may not be lost.’
032	JON	001	007	The sailors said to one another, ‘Come, let us cast lots to discover on whose account this evil has come upon us.’ So they cast lots, and the lot indicated Jonah.
032	JON	001	008	So they said to him, ‘Are you to blame for this? Tell us, what is your business, and where do you come from? What is your country and to what people do you belong?’
032	JON	001	009	He replied, ‘I am a Hebrew, and a worshipper of the Lord, the God of heaven, who made the sea and the dry land.’
032	JON	001	010	Then the men were greatly frightened and said to him, ‘What have you done?’ For they knew that he was fleeing from the presence of the Lord, because he had told them.
032	JON	001	011	Then they said to him, ‘What should we do to you, to make the sea calm for us?’ For the sea grew more and more stormy.
032	JON	001	012	He said to them, ‘Take me up and throw me into the sea, and the sea will be calm for you, for I know that it is because of me this fierce storm has overtaken you.’
032	JON	001	013	But instead the men rowed hard to get back to the land; they could not, however, for the sea grew more and more stormy ahead.
032	JON	001	014	So they cried to the Lord and said, ‘We beg you, Lord, we beg you, don’t let us die for this man’s life, and don’t let us be guilty of shedding innocent blood, for you are the Lord; you have done as it pleases you.’
032	JON	001	015	And they took up Jonah, and threw him into the sea; and the sea became calm.
032	JON	001	016	Then the men greatly feared the Lord, and they offered a sacrifice and made vows to him.
032	JON	001	017	But the Lord arranged for a great fish to swallow Jonah, and Jonah was inside the fish three days and three nights.
032	JON	002	001	Jonah prayed to the Lord his God, out of the belly of the fish,
032	JON	002	002	and said: I cried out of my distress, to the Lord and he answered me; out of the midst of Sheol I cried aloud, and you heard my voice.
032	JON	002	003	For you cast me into the deep, into heart of the seas, and the great flood rolled about me; all your breakers and your waves passed over me.
032	JON	002	004	Then I said, I am driven out, away from your sight; How will I ever again look towards your holy temple?
032	JON	002	005	The waters surrounded me, the great deep engulfed me, the sea weeds were wrapped about my head.
032	JON	002	006	I went down to the roots of the mountains; the prison of the earth closed over me forever. Yet you brought up my life from destruction, O Lord my God.
032	JON	002	007	As my life slipped away, I remembered the Lord; and my prayer reached you, in your holy temple.
032	JON	002	008	Those who worship worthless idols abandon their own mercy,
032	JON	002	009	but I will sacrifice to you with loud thanksgiving! I will pay that which I have vowed. Salvation is the Lord’s.
032	JON	002	010	And the Lord spoke to the fish, and it threw up Jonah upon the dry land.
032	JON	003	001	This message from the Lord came to Jonah the second time,
032	JON	003	002	‘Arise, go to that great city, Nineveh, and proclaim to it the message that I tell you.’
032	JON	003	003	So Jonah started for Nineveh, as the Lord commanded. Now Nineveh was so large a city that it took three days’ journey to cross it.
032	JON	003	004	Jonah began by going a day’s journey into the city, and he proclaimed, ‘Forty days more and Nineveh will be overthrown.’
032	JON	003	005	And the people of Nineveh believed God; and they ordered a fast and put on sackcloth, from the greatest to the least of them.
032	JON	003	006	And when word came to the king of Nineveh, he rose from his throne, took off his robe, dressed in sackcloth, and sat in ashes.
032	JON	003	007	And he made this proclamation and published it in Nineveh: ‘By the decree of the king and his nobles: People, beast, herd, and flock must not taste anything; let them not eat nor drink water.
032	JON	003	008	Let both people and animals put on sackcloth and let them cry earnestly to God; let them each turn from their evil ways and from the deeds of violence which they are doing.
032	JON	003	009	Who knows? God may relent and avert his fierce anger, so that we may not die.’
032	JON	003	010	When God saw that they turned from their evil course, he relented the evil which he said he would do to them, and did not do it.
032	JON	004	001	But this seemed very wrong to Jonah and he became angry.
032	JON	004	002	He prayed to the Lord and said, ‘Ah, Lord, wasn’t this what I said when I was still in my own country? That was why I fled at once to Tarshish; for I knew that you are a gracious and merciful God, patient, and loving and ready to forgive.
032	JON	004	003	Therefore, Lord, I beg you, take my life from me; for it is better for me to die than to live!’
032	JON	004	004	But the Lord said, ‘Are you doing right in being angry?’
032	JON	004	005	Then Jonah went out of the city and sat down on the east side, and there made a hut for himself and sat under it, waiting to see what would become of the city.
032	JON	004	006	And the Lord arranged for a bush to grow up over Jonah as a shade for his head to make him comfortable. The bush gave Jonah great pleasure;
032	JON	004	007	but at dawn the next day God arranged for a worm which attacked the bush, so that it wilted.
032	JON	004	008	And when the sun rose, God arranged a hot east wind. And the sun beat upon Jonah’s head, so that he was faint and begged that he might die, saying, ‘It is better for me to die than to live.’
032	JON	004	009	But God said to Jonah, ‘Are you doing right in being angry about the bush?’ He replied, ‘I have every right to be as angry as I could possibly be!’
032	JON	004	010	The Lord said, ‘You care about a bush which has cost you no trouble and which you have not made grow, which came up in a night and wilted in a night.
032	JON	004	011	Should I not care for the great city Nineveh, in which there are one hundred and twenty thousand people who do not know their right hand from their left; and many cattle too?’

# BOOK	033	MIC	Micah	Micah
033	MIC	001	001	The Lord’s message which came to Micah of Morsheth in the reigns of Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah. The visions he saw about Samaria and Jerusalem.
033	MIC	001	002	Listen, all you peoples! Pay attention, all you inhabitants of the earth! For the Lord God will be a witness against you, the Lord from his holy temple!
033	MIC	001	003	The Lord is coming from his holy place, he descends and treads on the heights of the earth,
033	MIC	001	004	so that the mountains melt beneath like wax in the presence of the fire, and the valleys break apart like water poured down a steep descent.
033	MIC	001	005	All this is because of the crime of Jacob, and for the sin of the house of Israel. What was the crime of Jacob? Was it not Samaria? What is the sin of Judah? Is it not Jerusalem?
033	MIC	001	006	‘I will make Samaria a ruin in an open field, and a place where a vineyard is planted, I will hurl down her stones into the valley, and lay bare her foundations.
033	MIC	001	007	‘All her images will be shattered, and all her statues will be burned with fire, and all her idols I will lay in ruins. For they were acquired by prostitution, and to prostitution they will return.’
033	MIC	001	008	This is why I will mourn and wail, I will go barefoot and naked, I will howl like the jackals and mourn like the desert owl.
033	MIC	001	009	For the blow that Samaria has received is incurable. It has spread over Judah, it extends even to the gate of my people, even to Jerusalem.
033	MIC	001	010	Don’t tell this in Gath! Don’t even cry – but sit in the dust at Beth-leaphrah.
033	MIC	001	011	Pass by, inhabitants of Shaphir, naked and ashamed! The inhabitants of Zaanan cannot leave their city. Beth-ezel laments and removes its support from you.
033	MIC	001	012	The inhabitants of Maroth wait anxiously for good! But the Lord has sent disaster to the gates of Jerusalem.
033	MIC	001	013	Harness the horse to the chariot, inhabitants of Lachish. You led the daughter of Zion, Jerusalem, into sin, in you are found the crimes of Israel.
033	MIC	001	014	Therefore you must give parting gifts to Moresheth-gath. Beth-achzib will betray the kings of Israel.
033	MIC	001	015	I will hand you to a conqueror, people of Mareshah, the leaders of Israel will hide in Adullam Cave!
033	MIC	001	016	Shave your head in mourning for the children you love, until you are bald as vultures, because they have left you for exile.
033	MIC	002	001	Woe to those who lie awake planning evil, who in the light of morning carry out their plan because they have the power to do it.
033	MIC	002	002	They covet fields and seize them, desire houses and take them, they crush householder and his household, people and their possessions.
033	MIC	002	003	Therefore the Lord says: ‘I am planning disaster from which you cannot save your neck, nor walk proudly because it will be a terrible time.
033	MIC	002	004	On that day they will sing a taunt-song to you, this mocking lament: “My people’s estate is being measured for sale, our captors are dividing our fields. We are completely undone.”
033	MIC	002	005	There will be no one to measure out land for you from the Lord’s community.
033	MIC	002	006	‘“Don’t rant!” they urge, “Of such things one does not prophesy! Shame will not overtake us!
033	MIC	002	007	Is the Lord impatient, or are such things his deeds? Are not his words favourable to the family of Jacob?” Aren’t my commands good for those who obey them?
033	MIC	002	008	But you, you stand up as a foe against those who are peaceful; you strip the robe from those who pass by quietly, averse to conflict.
033	MIC	002	009	Women of my people you drive out from their happy homes, from their young children you take away my glory forever.
033	MIC	002	010	Rise and begone, for this is no place to rest. Your uncleanness brings destruction, severe destruction.
033	MIC	002	011	If a person walking in wine and falsehood were to say, “I will prophesy to you of wine and strong drink,” then he would be the perfect prophet for this people!’
033	MIC	002	012	‘I will assuredly assemble all of Jacob, I will surely gather the survivors of Israel. I will herd them together as sheep in a fold, like a flock in the pasture, and the land will resound with the sounds of multitudes.
033	MIC	002	013	‘The one who breaks out goes first. They have broken forth and passed by the gate and through it have they gone out. Their king leads before them, the Lord at their head.’
033	MIC	003	001	I also said: ‘Listen now, leaders of Jacob, judges of the house of Israel. Is it not your duty to know what is the right?
033	MIC	003	002	Haters of that which is good and lovers of evil!
033	MIC	003	003	‘They devour the flesh of my people, and their hide they strip from off them, and break in pieces and serve up their bones, like meat in a pot or the cooking pan!
033	MIC	003	004	‘Then they will cry out to the Lord, but he will not pay attention to them. He will hide his face from them at that time because they have committed such crimes.’
033	MIC	003	005	Therefore the Lord says: ‘To the prophets who lead my people astray, who when they have food between their teeth declare peace, but against one who puts nothing in their mouths, they proclaim an open war!
033	MIC	003	006	‘Night will overtake you so that you have no vision, and darkness so that there will be no divination, and the sun will go down on the prophets, and the day will be dark over them.
033	MIC	003	007	‘The seers will be ashamed, and the diviners will turn pale, all of them will cover their mouths. For there will be no answer from God.
033	MIC	003	008	‘But I, on the contrary am full of power, and the sense of justice and strength, to make known to Jacob his crime, and to Israel his sin.
033	MIC	003	009	‘Hear this, leaders of the house of Jacob, judges of the house of Israel, you who spurn justice, and make all that is straight crooked,
033	MIC	003	010	who build Zion with acts of bloodshed, and Jerusalem with crime.
033	MIC	003	011	‘The leaders render judgment for a bribe, and her priests give oracles for a reward, and her prophets divine for silver. Yet they claim to rely on the Lord, “The Lord”, they say, “is in our midst. Evil cannot overtake us.”
033	MIC	003	012	‘Therefore for your sakes Zion will be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem will become a heap of ruins, and the temple mount a wooded height.’
033	MIC	004	001	In the days to come the mountain of the Lord will be established, the house of our God on the top of the mountain, lifted above the hills. All the nations will flow to it,
033	MIC	004	002	and many peoples will go and say, ‘Come, let us go up to the Lord’s mount, to the house of the God of Jacob, so that he may instruct us in his ways, so that we may walk in his paths.’ For from Zion proceeds instruction and the Lord’s word from Jerusalem.
033	MIC	004	003	He will arbitrate between many peoples, and render decisions for numerous nations, They will beat their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not lift up sword against nation, they will learn war no more.
033	MIC	004	004	They will live each under his vine, and under his fig tree, with none to terrify them. For the mouth of the Lord of hosts has spoken.
033	MIC	004	005	Each nation trusts in the names of their gods, but we will worship the Lord our God forever.
033	MIC	004	006	‘On that day,’ says the Lord, ‘I will assemble the lame. I will gather exiles I punished.
033	MIC	004	007	I will restore the lame as a remnant, the exiles into a great nation. The Lord will rule over them on Mount Zion from that time forever.’
033	MIC	004	008	But you, watchtower for the flock, hill of the daughter of Zion, to you will return your former rule.
033	MIC	004	009	So why do you now cry aloud? Haven’t you any king? Or has your counsellor perished, so you writhe in pain like a woman in labour?
033	MIC	004	010	Writhe and scream, daughter of Zion, like a woman in labour! For now you must leave the city and camp in the open field. You will be taken to Babylon, but there will be rescued. There the Lord will save you from the hands of your foes.
033	MIC	004	011	But now many nations gather against you. They say, ‘Let her be defiled, we will gloat over Zion.’
033	MIC	004	012	But they do not know the thoughts of the Lord. They do not understand his plan, for he has gathered them like sheaves for the threshing floor.
033	MIC	004	013	‘Arise, thresh, daughter of Zion. I will make your horns iron, and your hoofs brass, so you might beat in pieces many peoples, and devote to the Lord their spoil, and their wealth to the ruler of all the earth.
033	MIC	005	001	‘Now cut yourself in bitter grief, daughter besieged by soldiers. They have set a wall around you. They strike the ruler of Israel, in the face with a rod.
033	MIC	005	002	‘Bethlehem in Ephrathah, small among the tribes of Judah, from you will come a king who will rule for me over Israel, whose family line goes back to the distant past.’
033	MIC	005	003	So the Lord will only abandon Israel to its enemies until the woman in labour gives birth. Then the survivors will be reunited with their own people.
033	MIC	005	004	And he will stand and shepherd by the strength of the Lord, In the exalted name of the Lord his God; And they will live in security, for now he will be great, even to the ends of the earth.
033	MIC	005	005	This will be our peace: when Assyria comes into our land and treads on our soil, we will raise up against him seven shepherds, eight leaders of men.
033	MIC	005	006	They will shepherd Assyria with a sword, and the land of Nimrod with bared blades. They will deliver us from Assyria, when they come into our land, and tread within our borders.
033	MIC	005	007	And the survivors of Jacob will be disbursed among the nations, in the midst of many peoples, like dew from the Lord, like showers on the grass, which don’t wait for people to come or linger for mortals.
033	MIC	005	008	And the survivors of Jacob will be disbursed among the nations, in the midst of many peoples, like a lion among the beasts of the forest, like a young lion among the sheep-folds, who, when he passes through, pounces. He savages his prey. There is no rescuer.
033	MIC	005	009	Let your hand triumph over your adversaries, let all your enemies be cut off.
033	MIC	005	010	On that day, says the Lord: ‘I will slaughter your horses from your midst, and destroy your chariots.
033	MIC	005	011	I will devastate the cities in your land, and tear down your fortresses.
033	MIC	005	012	I will destroy your magic charms, and you will have no soothsayers.
033	MIC	005	013	I will cut down your idols and sacred pillars, and you will not worship any more the work of your hands.
033	MIC	005	014	I will uproot your sacred poles, and destroy your idols.
033	MIC	005	015	In my wrath and my anger I will seek vengeance on the nations that ignore me.’
033	MIC	006	001	Hear now what the Lord is saying: Arise, present your complaint before the mountains, let the hills hear your voice!
033	MIC	006	002	Hear, mountains, the Lord’s accusation, listen, foundations of the earth. For the Lord has a case against his people. He has a dispute with Israel.
033	MIC	006	003	‘My people, what have I done to you? How have I displeased you? Answer me!
033	MIC	006	004	For I brought you up from the land of Egypt, from the land of slavery I redeemed you. I sent Moses, Aaron, and Miriam to lead you.
033	MIC	006	005	My people, what did Balak, king of Moab counsel? And how did Balaam, the son of Beor, answer him? Remember now the journey from Shittim to Gilgal, so that you might realise the just deeds of the Lord.’
033	MIC	006	006	With what should I come before the Lord? Bow myself before the God on high? Should I come before him with burnt-offerings, with calves a year old?
033	MIC	006	007	Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams, With ten thousand streams of oil? Should I give him my firstborn son for my guilt, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?
033	MIC	006	008	The Lord has told you what is good, what he demands of you: Only to do justice and love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God.
033	MIC	006	009	Listen! The Lord calls to the city! Listen, tribe and assembly of the city!
033	MIC	006	010	‘Can I forget the hoarded treasures in the houses of the wicked, and the accursed scant measure?
033	MIC	006	011	Can I leave her unpunished because of evil scales, and the bag of false weights?
033	MIC	006	012	Whose rich people are full of violence, her inhabitants liars, whose tongues speak deceit?
033	MIC	006	013	‘But I indeed, have begun to punish you, to lay you in ruins because of your sins.
033	MIC	006	014	You will eat but not be satisfied, your stomach empty within you. You will store up but lose everything, because whatever you save I will give to the sword.
033	MIC	006	015	You will sow but not reap. You will tread the olives but have no oil for rubbing, tread grapes but drink no wine!
033	MIC	006	016	‘For you have followed the commands of Omri, and all the practices of the house of Ahab. You have acted in accord with their counsels, so I will give you up to ruin, the city’s inhabitants to derision. The nations will treat you with contempt!’
033	MIC	007	001	Woe, woe is me, for I have become like a field after harvest, like a vineyard after gathering; not a cluster of grapes to eat, not a fig that anyone desires.
033	MIC	007	002	The honest have perished from the land, of the upright among people there is none. All of them lie in wait to shed blood. They hunt one another with the net.
033	MIC	007	003	Their hands know well how to do evil, the officer and judge demands a bribe, the high official decides as he pleases and they conspire to pervert justice.
033	MIC	007	004	The best of them are like a thorn thicket, their most upright like a prickly hedge. The day of their punishment has come, now will be their confusion!
033	MIC	007	005	Do not trust your neighbour, do not rely on a friend. From the wife who lies in your arms guard your tongue.
033	MIC	007	006	For son insults father, daughter rises up against mother, daughter-in-law against mother-in-law, a man’s enemies are the people of his own household.
033	MIC	007	007	But I will look to the Lord, I will wait for the God of my salvation. My God will hear me!
033	MIC	007	008	Do not rejoice over me, my enemy. If I have fallen, I will rise. If I sit in darkness, the Lord is my light.
033	MIC	007	009	The anger of the Lord I will bear, for against him have I sinned – until he champions my cause and gives judgment for me. He will bring me into to the light, I will see his justice.
033	MIC	007	010	So my enemy will see, and shame will cover them, they who said, ‘Where is the Lord your God?’ I will look upon them, they will be trampled on like mud in the street!
033	MIC	007	011	It is a day for rebuilding your walls, this day will your boundary will be extended.
033	MIC	007	012	This day they will come to you, from Assyria and the cities of Egypt, and from Egypt even to the Euphrates River, from sea to sea, and from mountain to mountain.
033	MIC	007	013	Though the land has become a desolation because of its inhabitants, because of their deeds.
033	MIC	007	014	Shepherd your flock with your staff, the flock that belong to you, who live alone in the forest, in the midst of meadows; so that they may pasture in Bashon and Gilead as in the days of old,
033	MIC	007	015	as in the days when you came from Egypt, gave us wonders to see.
033	MIC	007	016	Nations will see and be ashamed of all their might; they will put their hands to their mouth, their ears will become deaf,
033	MIC	007	017	they will lick the dust like snakes, like creatures that crawl on the earth; they will come trembling and in terror from their hiding places, in dread and fear.
033	MIC	007	018	Who is a God like you, forgiving iniquity and passing by the rebellion of the remnant of your people? He does not retain his anger forever, but is one who delights in mercy.
033	MIC	007	019	He will tread under foot our iniquity; you will cast into the depths of the sea all our iniquities.
033	MIC	007	020	You will show faithfulness to Jacob, and loving kindness to Abraham, as you have sworn to our ancestors from the days of old.

# BOOK	034	NAH	Nahum	Nahum
034	NAH	001	001	A message about Nineveh, a vision which came to Nahum from Elkosh.
034	NAH	001	002	The Lord tolerates no rivals. The Lord is vengeful and fierce in wrath. The Lord does not fail to punish his foes; the Lord is vengeful against his enemies.
034	NAH	001	003	The Lord is slow to anger, great in power. The guilty will not escape his punishment. Storm tempest is his path and cloud is the dust of his feet.
034	NAH	001	004	He rebukes the sea and dries it up and makes all the streams run dry. Bashan and Carmel are languishing and the bloom of Lebanon is withered.
034	NAH	001	005	The mountains tremble before him and the hills dissolve. The earth heaves before him, the world and all who live in it.
034	NAH	001	006	Who can stand before his wrath? Who can withstand the heat of his anger? His fierce fury pours forth like fire, he shatters rocks.
034	NAH	001	007	The Lord is good to those who hope in him, a place of refuge in the day of trouble.
034	NAH	001	008	With rushing flood an end he makes of those who rise against him, he drives his enemies into darkness.
034	NAH	001	009	Why do you plot against the Lord? He will end you. He only takes vengeance once.
034	NAH	001	010	Thorns, tangled and drenched, they are consumed like dry stubble.
034	NAH	001	011	Nineveh! From you has arisen one who plots evil against the Lord, a counsellor of wickedness.
034	NAH	001	012	The Lord says: ‘Though they are many and strong, they will pass away and be gone. Though I have afflicted you, I will afflict you no more,
034	NAH	001	013	and now I will break his yoke from your necks and snap your chains.’
034	NAH	001	014	The Lord has given this command concerning you, Nineveh: ‘Your name will no longer be remembered. I will destroy every idol and image in the house of your God. I will destroy even your tomb, for you are worthless.’
034	NAH	001	015	Look! On the mountains a messenger bringing good news, announcing peace! ‘Celebrate the feasts, Judah, fulfil your vows. Never again will these enemies invade your land, they are destroyed!’
034	NAH	002	001	Nineveh! The destroyer has come up against you; mount guard upon the rampart; watch the road; brace yourselves; strengthen your might to the utmost.
034	NAH	002	002	For the Lord is restoring the majesty of Jacob and of Israel, though the devastators have plundered them and destroyed their vines.
034	NAH	002	003	The shields of his warriors are dyed red, his soldiers are clothed in scarlet, his chariots gleam like fire on the day he prepares for battle spears are shaken.
034	NAH	002	004	Chariots rush across the fields, storm through the squares; they flame like torches, they dart like lightening.
034	NAH	002	005	A leader rallies his nobles, they hurl themselves forward. They speed on toward the wall; the storming-shield is set up.
034	NAH	002	006	The water-gates are thrown open, and the palace dissolves in ruins.
034	NAH	002	007	The queen is stripped, she is carried off. Her maids moan like doves, beating upon their breasts.
034	NAH	002	008	Like a pool of water is Nineveh, her waters fast ebbing away. ‘Stand firm! Stand firm!’ someone cries, but no one turns back.
034	NAH	002	009	‘Loot the silver, loot the gold, for there is no end to the treasure, the wealth and precious things.’
034	NAH	002	010	Nineveh is empty, desolate, devastated, with faint heart and knocking knee. There is weakness in every limb, and faces grow pale.
034	NAH	002	011	Where now is the den of lions? Where now the lair of their young? Where the lion used to withdraw, with his cubs, with none to disturb them?
034	NAH	002	012	The lion tore enough for his cubs, and strangled prey for his lionesses. He filled his caves with the kill, he filled his lairs with fresh meat.
034	NAH	002	013	‘But see, I am against you,’ the Lord of hosts declares, ‘I will burn your chariots in smoke and fire. The sword will devour your young lions. You will never again prey on the land. No more will your messengers be heard.’
034	NAH	003	001	Woe to the bloody city! Full of lies and plunder, without end is the spoil.
034	NAH	003	002	Hear the crack of the whip, hear the rattle of wheels. Galloping horses, jolting chariots.
034	NAH	003	003	Horsemen charging, swords flashing, spears glittering, a multitude of slain, a heap of bodies, no end to the corpses over which people stumble!
034	NAH	003	004	‘Because you acted like a whore, bewitching the nations, enticing the peoples,
034	NAH	003	005	I am against you, Nineveh’ the Lord of hosts declares. ‘I will strip your clothes and show the nations your nakedness, and the kingdoms your shame.
034	NAH	003	006	‘I will fling loathsome filth at you, and make you an object of contempt, a spectacle,
034	NAH	003	007	so that everyone who sees you will flee from you and say: “Nineveh is laid waste, who will mourn for her?”
034	NAH	003	008	‘Are you any better than Thebes, which stood on the banks of the Nile, with waters around as a rampart, whose wall was the sea of waters?
034	NAH	003	009	Her strength was Ethiopia and Egypt. The Libyans were her helpers, and Put with its countless people.
034	NAH	003	010	Yet she was exiled and made captive. On all corners of the streets her infants were dashed to pieces. Lots were cast for her nobles, all her great ones were bound in chains.
034	NAH	003	011	‘You too, Nineveh, will be drunk with fear; you too will seek a place of escape from the foe.
034	NAH	003	012	All your fortresses are fig trees with the first ripe figs; if shaken, they fall into the mouth of the eater!
034	NAH	003	013	Your troops are weak as women before your foes; the gates of your land are wide open; your defenses burned down.
034	NAH	003	014	‘Draw water for the siege, strengthen your forts. Go to the clay pits and tread the clay; take up the brick moulds.
034	NAH	003	015	There the fire will consume you, the sword will cut you down. Multiply like the locust or a swarm of grasshoppers.
034	NAH	003	016	Increase the numbers of your merchants until they are more than the stars of heaven,
034	NAH	003	017	until your watchmen are locusts, and your scribes like grasshoppers, which swarm in the hedges on a cold day; but when the sun rises they fly away, no one knows where.
034	NAH	003	018	‘King of Assyria: your princes slumber, your nobles sleep! Your people are scattered on the mountains with no one to gather them!
034	NAH	003	019	There is no healing for your hurt, your wound is incurable. All who hear of your fate clap their hands in joy, for who has escaped your limitless cruelty?’

# BOOK	035	HAB	Habakkuk	Habakkuk
035	HAB	001	001	The message seen by the prophet Habakkuk.
035	HAB	001	002	How long, Lord, have I cried out and without you hearing me! I cry to you, ‘Violence!’ but you do not help.
035	HAB	001	003	Why do you make me look upon wickedness and behold trouble? Destruction and violence are before my eyes, and fighting and quarrelling.
035	HAB	001	004	Therefore the law is weak, and justice is never rendered; for the wicked surround the righteous, so that justice is perverted.
035	HAB	001	005	Look at the nations, look well, be shocked and amazed. For I am about to do a work in your days; you will not believe it when it is told.
035	HAB	001	006	For I am about to raise up the Chaldeans, a nation grim and quick of action who sweep over the whole breadth of the earth to seize dwellings not their own.
035	HAB	001	007	They bring fear and terror. They write their own rules.
035	HAB	001	008	Their horses are swifter than leopards, quicker than wolves hunting at dusk. From afar they come swooping down, like an eagle attacking its prey.
035	HAB	001	009	They all come to do violence, a horde like a desert wind, they gather up captives like sand.
035	HAB	001	010	At kings they scoff, and princes are sport to them. They laugh at every fortress, and heap up earth to take it.
035	HAB	001	011	Then they sweep on like the wind, Their strength is their god.
035	HAB	001	012	Are you not eternal, Lord, my holy one, who does not die? Lord you have appointed them to execute judgment, my rock, you have established them to punish.
035	HAB	001	013	Your eyes are too pure to look at evil, you cannot condone iniquity. So why do you regard the treacherous in silence, while the wicked swallows the upright?
035	HAB	001	014	You have made people like the fish of the sea, like reptiles that have no ruler.
035	HAB	001	015	The wicked sweep them all into their nets, and gather them into their drag-nets, and rejoice and celebrate.
035	HAB	001	016	Therefore they sacrifice to their net, and burn offerings to their drag-net; for by their nets are their portions generous, and their food is rich.
035	HAB	001	017	Will they empty their nets continually, slaughter nations unpityingly?
035	HAB	002	001	I will take my stand on my watch-tower, and station myself on a turret. I will watch to see what the Lord will say to me, what answer he will make to my complaint.
035	HAB	002	002	Then the Lord answered me and said: Inscribe the vision plainly on tablets, so that even someone running by could read it.
035	HAB	002	003	Though the vision waits for the time set, it hastens to fulfilment and will not fail; Though it linger long, wait for it. For it surely will come and will not be delayed.
035	HAB	002	004	The strength of the proud fails, but the upright lives by their faithfulness.
035	HAB	002	005	Wealth is treacherous, the arrogant never have enough. They make their desire as wide as Sheol, are like death, unsatisfied, For they gather to themselves all the nations, bring together to themselves all peoples.
035	HAB	002	006	Shouldn’t everyone mock them? sing a taunt-song against them, and say: Woe to the person who amasses what is not theirs, and loads them self down with goods taken in pledge!
035	HAB	002	007	Won’t your creditors suddenly rise, and those who will overthrow you awake, and you become their prey?
035	HAB	002	008	For as you have plundered many peoples, the survivors will prey upon you. You have shed blood and committed violence to the earth, peoples and their cities.
035	HAB	002	009	Woe to you who seeks unjust gain for your dynasty, who sets your nest on high to be safe from the reach of misfortune!
035	HAB	002	010	You have planned only shame for your dynasty. You have destroyed many peoples, and brought guilt upon yourself;
035	HAB	002	011	the stone will cry out from the wall, and the beam from the timber will answer it.
035	HAB	002	012	Woe to the person who builds a city by bloodshed, and founds a town by crime
035	HAB	002	013	while the peoples toil for what fires will consume, and the nations weary themselves for nothing! This the Lord of hosts has said,
035	HAB	002	014	and the earth will be as full of the knowledge of the glory of the Lord as the seas are full of water.
035	HAB	002	015	Woe to him who in fury gives drink to his neighbor to make him drunk, and see him naked.
035	HAB	002	016	You are filled with shame, not glory; drink yourself and be uncovered. The cup from the Lord’s hand will pass in turn to you, and shame will cover your glory!
035	HAB	002	017	For the violence done to Lebanon will overwhelm you, the destruction of animals will terrify you, because you shed people’s blood on the earth, destroyed people and their cities.
035	HAB	002	018	What use is an idol? A human made it, a metal image. It cannot speak, it cannot teach truth, Why does its maker trust it?
035	HAB	002	019	Woe to the person who says to a block, awake! to a dumb stone, arise! What can it teach? It may be set with gold and silver, but there is no breath at all within it.
035	HAB	002	020	The Lord is in his holy temple. Let all the earth be silent before him!
035	HAB	003	001	A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet, according to the Shigionoth.
035	HAB	003	002	I have heard, Lord, of your fame, I have seen, Lord, your work; through the years you have make yourself known, in wrath you remember mercy.
035	HAB	003	003	God comes from Teman, and the Holy One from the mountain-land of Paran. (Selah) His glory covers the heavens, and his splendour fills the earth.
035	HAB	003	004	Before him it is like the light, rays he has at his side, where his power is hidden.
035	HAB	003	005	Before him pestilence stalks, after him plague follows.
035	HAB	003	006	He stands, and the earth trembles, he looks, and the nations melt away, and the mountains of old are scattered, the everlasting hills bow down. These are his ways from of old.
035	HAB	003	007	The tents of Cushan are afraid, the curtains of Midian tremble.
035	HAB	003	008	Is your wrath, Lord, with the rivers? Is your anger against the streams? Or your rage against the sea? Is that why you ride on your war-steeds? Why you mount your chariots of victory?
035	HAB	003	009	Why you bare your bow? Why you fill your quiver with shafts? You split the earth with torrents.
035	HAB	003	010	The mountains see you and writhe. The tempest of waters sweeps by. The great deep sends forth its voice, and lifts up its hands.
035	HAB	003	011	The sun forgets to rise. The moon stands still in its place. Your arrows go forth to give light. Your glittering spear is as lightning.
035	HAB	003	012	In rage you stride over the earth. In wrath you trample the nations.
035	HAB	003	013	You go forth to save your people. You go to help your anointed. You crush the head of the wicked nation, laying him bare from thigh to neck. (Selah)
035	HAB	003	014	You pierced his head with his spears, as his champions storm out to scatter us, as they rejoice to devour the poor secretly.
035	HAB	003	015	You tread the sea with your horses, while the mighty waters roar.
035	HAB	003	016	I hear, and my body trembles, and at the sound my lips quiver. My bones begin to decay, and my footsteps totter beneath me, while I long for the day of distress to come upon those who attack us.
035	HAB	003	017	Though the fig tree bears no fruit, and there are no grapes on the vines, though the olive harvest fails, and the fields produce no food, though the flock is cut off from the fold, and there is no herd in the stalls,
035	HAB	003	018	yet I will exult in the Lord, and rejoice in the God who saves me.
035	HAB	003	019	The Lord God is my strength; he makes my feet as sure as the feet of deer, and causes me to walk on the heights! To the music director: Use stringed instruments.

# BOOK	036	ZEP	Zephaniah	Zephaniah
036	ZEP	001	001	The Lord’s message, which came to Zephaniah, son of Cushi, son of Gedaliah, son of Amariah, son of Hezekiah, in the time of Josiah of Judah who was son of Amon.
036	ZEP	001	002	I will utterly destroy everything from off the face of the earth, says the Lord.
036	ZEP	001	003	I will sweep away human and animal, the birds of the sky and the fish of the sea. I will cause the wicked to stumble, and I will cut off humanity from the face of the earth, says the Lord.
036	ZEP	001	004	I will stretch out my hand over Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and I will cut off from this place the last remnant of Baal and the name of the heathen priests,
036	ZEP	001	005	and those who worship on the housetops to the stars in the sky, and those worshippers of the Lord who also pay homage to Milcom,
036	ZEP	001	006	and those who turn back from following the Lord, And those who do not seek the Lord nor strive to find him.
036	ZEP	001	007	Be silent before the Lord God, for near is the day of the Lord, for the Lord has prepared a sacrifice, he has sanctified his guests.
036	ZEP	001	008	On the day of the Lord’s sacrifice: I will punish the officers and the royal princes, and all those who clothe themselves in foreign apparel.
036	ZEP	001	009	On that day: I will punish all who leap over the threshold, who fill the house of their lord with violence and deceit.
036	ZEP	001	010	Listen on that day, says the Lord: A cry will be heard from the Fish Gate, and a wailing from the New Quarter, and a great din from the hills.
036	ZEP	001	011	Those who live in the Mortar wail, for all the traders are silenced, the money counters wiped out.
036	ZEP	001	012	I will search Jerusalem with a lamp, I will punish those who are at ease, who sit comfortably with their wine, who say to themselves, ‘the Lord brings neither prosperity nor calamity.’
036	ZEP	001	013	Their wealth will become a prey and their houses a desolation. Though they build houses, they will not inhabit them; though they plant vineyards, they will not drink wine from them.
036	ZEP	001	014	Near is the day of the Lord! Near and rapidly approaching! Near is the bitter day of the Lord, and the scream of the warrior.
036	ZEP	001	015	That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a day of destruction and desolation, a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and thick darkness,
036	ZEP	001	016	a day of the trumpet and battle-cry, against the fortified cities and against the high battlements.
036	ZEP	001	017	And I will bring distress upon the people and they will walk as the blind, because they have sinned against the Lord, and their blood will be poured out as dust and their flesh as dung.
036	ZEP	001	018	Neither their silver nor their gold will be able to save them. For in the day of the wrath of the Lord and in the fire of his fury the whole earth will be consumed. For he will make a speedy end of all the inhabitants of the earth.
036	ZEP	002	001	Be ashamed within yourselves, be ashamed,
036	ZEP	002	002	before you become as the drifting chaff, before the anger of the Lord comes upon you, before the day of the Lord’s wrath comes upon you.
036	ZEP	002	003	Seek the Lord all you meek of the earth, you who obey his law; Seek righteousness, seek meekness; perhaps you may be hidden in the day of the Lord’s wrath.
036	ZEP	002	004	For Gaza will be forsaken; Ashkelon a desolation; Ashdod – by noon will they rout her and Ekron be torn up!
036	ZEP	002	005	Woe to those who live by the sea coast, people of the Cherethites! The word of the Lord is against you, Canaan, land of the Philistines! I will destroy you so that you will be without inhabitants,
036	ZEP	002	006	and you will become shepherds’ cots and folds for flocks.
036	ZEP	002	007	The sea coast will belong to the survivors of the house of Judah. They will pasture their flocks there. In the house of Ashkelon they will lie down at evening. The Lord their God will be with them and restore their fortunes.
036	ZEP	002	008	I have heard the taunts of Moab, and the revilings of the Ammonites, how they have taunted my people, and spoken boastfully concerning their border.
036	ZEP	002	009	Therefore as I live, says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Moab will be like Sodom, and the Ammonites like Gomorrah, a pile of nettles and saltpits, and a desolation, forever. The residue of my people will plunder them, and the survivors of my nation will inherit them.
036	ZEP	002	010	This will they have for their pride, because they have taunted and spoken boastfully against the people of the Lord of hosts.
036	ZEP	002	011	The Lord will terrify them; he will reduce all the gods of the earth; then all the peoples of the nations will worship him, each in their own land.
036	ZEP	002	012	You, also, Ethiopians, slain by his sword are you!
036	ZEP	002	013	And he will stretch out his hand against the north and destroy Assyria; And he will make Nineveh a desolation, dry as the wilderness.
036	ZEP	002	014	Herds will lie down in it, every beast of the earth, Desert owl and screech owl will lodge in its capitals. The owl will hoot in the window, the raven on the doorstep, all stripped bare of cedar.
036	ZEP	002	015	This is the exultant city which sat secure. The city who said to herself, I am and there is none else! How has she become a desolation! A lair of beasts! Every passerby hisses at her, shakes their hand.
036	ZEP	003	001	Woe to the rebellious and unclean city of oppression,
036	ZEP	003	002	She has not obeyed the voice, she has not accepted instruction, In the Lord she has not trusted, to her God she has not drawn near.
036	ZEP	003	003	Her rulers in her midst are roaring lions. Her judges are evening wolves, who leave nothing over until the morning,
036	ZEP	003	004	Her prophets are braggarts, faithless men. Her priests profane what is holy and do violence to the law.
036	ZEP	003	005	The Lord is righteous in her midst, he does no wrong, Morning by morning he establishes his decree, Light is not lacking, an oversight is unknown. But the unjust know no shame.
036	ZEP	003	006	‘I have cut off nations, their turrets are destroyed; I have laid waste their broad streets, so that none passes over them. Desolate are their cities without people, without inhabitants.’
036	ZEP	003	007	I said: ‘Surely the city will fear me, she will accept instruction. Nothing will vanish from her eyes that I have impressed upon her; But the more zealously have they made all their deeds corrupt.’
036	ZEP	003	008	Wait for me, is the Lord’s message, until the day when I stand up as a witness, for it is my fixed purpose to gather the nations, to collect the kingdoms, to pour upon them my wrath and my hot anger; for by the fire of my fury will all the earth be consumed.
036	ZEP	003	009	For then I will purify the lips of all peoples, so that they will all call on the Lord’s name, to serve him with one accord.
036	ZEP	003	010	From beyond the rivers of Cush my worshipers will bring me offerings.
036	ZEP	003	011	On that day you will no longer be ashamed of all your deeds by which you rebelled against me. For I will rid you of your proudly arrogant ones, and you will never again be haughty on my holy mountain.
036	ZEP	003	012	But I will leave in your midst a people humble and poor, and the remnant of Israel will trust in the name of the Lord.
036	ZEP	003	013	They will not do evil, nor speak falsehood, and a deceitful tongue will not be found in their mouth; but they will pasture and lie down, and no one will make them afraid.
036	ZEP	003	014	Cry out with joy, daughter of Zion, shout aloud, Israel! Rejoice and exult with all your heart, daughter of Jerusalem.
036	ZEP	003	015	The Lord has put away your adversaries, he has turned away your foes; the Lord is king in your midst, you will fear evil no more.
036	ZEP	003	016	In that day it will be said to Jerusalem: Fear not! Zion, let not your hands grow weak!
036	ZEP	003	017	The Lord your God is in your midst, a victorious hero. He will rejoice over you with joy, he will renew his love, he will exult over you with singing,
036	ZEP	003	018	as on a day of festival. I will take away from you your disgrace, and put away from you your reproach.
036	ZEP	003	019	I will destroy at that time all who afflict you. I will deliver the lame, and gather the outcast, I will make them an object of renown and fame in all the earth.
036	ZEP	003	020	I will do good to you, at the time when I gather you. For I will make you an object of fame and renown among all the peoples of the earth; when I bring back your captivity before your eyes. This says the Lord.

# BOOK	037	HAG	Haggai	Haggai
037	HAG	001	001	In the second year of Darius the king, on the first day of the sixth month, this message from the Lord came through Haggai the prophet to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest:
037	HAG	001	002	The Lord of hosts says: The people say that the time has not yet come to rebuild the temple of the Lord.
037	HAG	001	003	Then this message from the Lord came to Haggai the prophet:
037	HAG	001	004	Is it a time for you yourselves to live in your own well-roofed houses, while this temple lies in ruins?
037	HAG	001	005	The Lord of hosts says: Consider your past experiences.
037	HAG	001	006	You sow much, but bring in little; you eat, but you do not have enough; you drink, but are not filled; you clothe yourselves, but not enough to be warm; and those who earn wages, put those wages in a bag with holes.
037	HAG	001	007	The Lord of hosts says: Consider your experiences.
037	HAG	001	008	Go up to the mountains, and bring wood and rebuild the temple; then I will be pleased with it, and I will reveal my glory. The Lord says:
037	HAG	001	009	You looked for much, and it came to little; and when you brought the harvest home, I blew it away. Why? The Lord of hosts says: Because my temple lies in ruins, while you shelter in your own houses.
037	HAG	001	010	The heavens withhold the dew, and the earth withholds its fruit,
037	HAG	001	011	and I have called forth a drought upon the land and upon the mountains, and upon the grain and the new wine and the oil and upon that which the ground brings forth, and upon people and animals, and upon all the labor of your hands.
037	HAG	001	012	Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and Joshua the son of Jehozadak the high priest, with all the rest of the people, obeyed the command of the Lord their God and the words of Haggai the prophet, as the Lord their God had sent him to them. They showed proper respect for the Lord.
037	HAG	001	013	Haggai, the prophet of the Lord, as the Lord commanded him, told the people: ‘The Lord says: I am with you.’
037	HAG	001	014	And the Lord stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Jehozadak the high priest, and the spirit of all the rest of the people, so that they came and worked on the temple of the Lord of hosts, their God,
037	HAG	001	015	in the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month. In the second year of Darius the king,
037	HAG	002	001	on the twenty-first day of the seventh month, this message from the Lord came to Haggai the prophet,
037	HAG	002	002	telling him to speak to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua, the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to all the rest of the people:
037	HAG	002	003	Who is left among you that saw this temple in its former glory? And how do you see it now? Doesn’t it seem as though there is nothing there?
037	HAG	002	004	The Lord says: Yet now be strong, Zerubbabel, be strong, Joshua, son of Jehozadak, the high priest, be strong, all you people of the land. The Lord says: Begin the work, for I am with you. The Lord of hosts says:
037	HAG	002	005	When your ancestors left Egypt I made a promise to you, and I am still with you. Do not be afraid!
037	HAG	002	006	The Lord of hosts says: In a little while, I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the land.
037	HAG	002	007	And I will shake all nations, and the precious things of all nations will come here; and I will fill this temple with glory. The Lord of hosts says:
037	HAG	002	008	The silver is mine, and the gold is mine,
037	HAG	002	009	The later glory of this temple will be greater than the former. The Lord of hosts says: In this place I will grant prosperity. This is the message of the Lord of hosts.
037	HAG	002	010	In the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, this message from the Lord came to Haggai the prophet:
037	HAG	002	011	The Lord of hosts says: ‘Ask the priests for a ruling:
037	HAG	002	012	“If one carries consecrated meat in the fold of his garment, and with that garment touches bread, or stew, or wine, or oil, or any food, will it become holy?”’ And the priests answered: ‘No.’
037	HAG	002	013	Then said Haggai, ‘If one who is unclean by reason of a dead body touches any of these, will it be unclean?’ And the priests answered: ‘It would be unclean.’
037	HAG	002	014	Haggai replied: ‘So is this people and so is this nation before me, the Lord declares, and so is every work of their hands; and that which they offer there is unclean.
037	HAG	002	015	Think back from this day, before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the Lord.
037	HAG	002	016	How were you? When you came to a heap of grain expecting twenty measures, there were only ten; when you came to the wine vat to draw out fifty vessels, there were only twenty.
037	HAG	002	017	“I struck all the work of your hands with blasting and blight, with mildew and with hail. Yet you didn’t turn to me,” says the Lord,
037	HAG	002	018	“Think back from this day, think! From the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, from the day when the foundations of the temple of the Lord were laid, and consider.
037	HAG	002	019	The seed is in the granary, but the vine and the fig tree and the pomegranate and the olive tree have not yet brought forth fruit. From this day will I bless you.”’
037	HAG	002	020	This message from the Lord came to Haggai a second time on the twenty-fourth day of the month:
037	HAG	002	021	Tell Zerubbabel, governor of Judah: I will shake the heavens and the earth;
037	HAG	002	022	and I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms; and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations; and I will overthrow the chariots, and those who ride in them; and the horses and their riders will come down, each by the sword of his fellow.
037	HAG	002	023	In that day, the Lord of hosts says, I will take you, Zerubbabel, my servant, the son of Shealtiel, the Lord says, and will make you like a signet ring, for I have chosen you, the Lord of hosts says.

# BOOK	038	ZEC	Zechariah	Zechariah
038	ZEC	001	001	In the eighth month in the second year of Darius, this message of the Lord came to the prophet Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo:
038	ZEC	001	002	The Lord was furious with your ancestors.
038	ZEC	001	003	So tell the people this message of the Lord of hosts: ‘Return to me,’ says the Lord of hosts, ‘and I will return to you’ says the Lord of hosts.
038	ZEC	001	004	‘Do not be like your ancestors to whom the former prophets cried, “The Lord of hosts says to turn now from your evil ways, and from your evil deeds”. They did not heed nor listen to me,’ says the Lord.
038	ZEC	001	005	‘Your ancestors, where are they? And the prophets, do they live forever?
038	ZEC	001	006	But did not my words and my statutes with which I charged my servants the prophets overtake your ancestors? And they repented and said, “Just as the Lord of hosts planned to do to us, according to our ways, and according to our deeds, so he has dealt with us.”’
038	ZEC	001	007	In the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Shebat, in the second year of Darius, this message of the Lord came to the prophet Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo:
038	ZEC	001	008	I saw in the night a man on a red horse, among the myrtle trees that were in the valley-bottom. Behind him there were horses, red, sorrel, and white.
038	ZEC	001	009	Then said I, ‘My Lord, what are these?’ And the messenger who was talking with me said, ‘I will show you what they are.’
038	ZEC	001	010	And the man who was standing among the myrtle trees answered, ‘They are those whom the Lord has sent to patrol the earth.’
038	ZEC	001	011	And the riders answered the messenger of the Lord who was standing among the myrtle trees, ‘We have gone up and down through the world and behold, all the earth is still and at peace.’
038	ZEC	001	012	Then the messenger of the Lord said, ‘Lord of hosts, how long will you have no pity for Jerusalem and the cities of Judah with which you have been angry for seventy years?’
038	ZEC	001	013	And the Lord answered the messenger who was talking with me with kind and comforting words.
038	ZEC	001	014	So the messenger who was talking with me said to me, ‘Proclaim now that the Lord of hosts says: I am deeply concerned for Jerusalem.
038	ZEC	001	015	But I am deeply angry with the arrogant, complacent nations. I was only a little angry with Israel but they made the suffering worse.
038	ZEC	001	016	Therefore, says the Lord, I am turning to show mercy to Jerusalem. My temple will be rebuilt in it, says the Lord of hosts, and a measuring line will be stretched over Jerusalem.
038	ZEC	001	017	Proclaim again: Thus says the Lord of hosts: My cities will again overflow with prosperity and the Lord will again comfort Zion and choose Jerusalem.’
038	ZEC	001	018	Now I looked up and saw four horns.
038	ZEC	001	019	I said to the messenger who was talking with me, ‘What are these?’ He answered, ‘These are the horns which scattered Judah, Israel and Jerusalem.’
038	ZEC	001	020	Then the Lord showed me four smiths.
038	ZEC	001	021	I said, ‘What are these coming to do?’ He answered, ‘The horns scattered Judah, so that no one dared lift their head. But the smiths have come to terrify them, to crush the horns of the nations which lifted up their horn against the land of Judah to scatter its people.’
038	ZEC	002	001	Then I looked up and saw a man with a measuring line in his hand.
038	ZEC	002	002	I said, ‘Where are you going?’ He replied, ‘To measure Jerusalem, to see what is its breadth and length.’
038	ZEC	002	003	Then the messenger who talked with me stepped forward, and another messenger went out to meet him,
038	ZEC	002	004	and said to him, ‘Run and tell to that young man that Jerusalem will be inhabited like a village without walls, because so many people and cattle will live there.
038	ZEC	002	005	For I, says the Lord, will be a wall of fire her, and I will be the glory in the midst of her.
038	ZEC	002	006	Up! Away! Flee from the land of the north, says the Lord. For I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heavens, says the Lord.
038	ZEC	002	007	Up, escape to Zion, you who live in Babylon.
038	ZEC	002	008	This is what the Lord of hosts says to the nations which plundered you: Whoever touches you touches the apple of my eye.
038	ZEC	002	009	I will raise my hand against them. They will be plunder for their own slaves; and you will know that the Lord of hosts has sent me.
038	ZEC	002	010	‘Sing and rejoice, daughter of Zion! I am coming, I will live among you, says the Lord.
038	ZEC	002	011	Many nations will join themselves to the Lord in that day, and will be his people, and he will live among you. You will know that the Lord of hosts has sent me to you.
038	ZEC	002	012	The Lord will inherit Judah as his portion in the holy land. He will again choose Jerusalem.
038	ZEC	002	013	Be silent, everyone, in the presence of the Lord, because he is coming from his holy dwelling.’
038	ZEC	003	001	Then he showed me Joshua, the high priest, standing before the messenger of the Lord and the Adversary standing at his right hand to accuse him.
038	ZEC	003	002	And the messenger of the Lord said to the Adversary, ‘May the Lord rebuke you, Adversary! The Lord, who has chosen Jerusalem, rebuke you! Is not this man a brand plucked out of the fire?’
038	ZEC	003	003	Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments and was standing before the messenger.
038	ZEC	003	004	The messenger said to those who stood before him, ‘Take off his filthy garments.’ Then to Joshua he said, ‘I have taken your guilt from you and I will clothe you in priestly robes.’
038	ZEC	003	005	And he ordered: ‘Set a clean turban upon his head.’ So they set a clean turban on his head, and clothed him with garments. The messenger of the Lord was standing by.
038	ZEC	003	006	And the messenger of the Lord testified to Joshua:
038	ZEC	003	007	The Lord of hosts says: ‘If you walk in my ways, and if you will keep my instructions, then you will rule my house and keep my courts and I will give you a place of access among these that stand by.
038	ZEC	003	008	Hear now, Joshua the high priest, you and your associates who sit before me; for they are men who are a sign; for I am going to bring forth my servant the Branch.
038	ZEC	003	009	On the stone that I have set before Joshua, on one stone, are seven facets. I will engrave it,’ says the Lord of hosts, ‘and I will remove the guilt of that land in one day.
038	ZEC	003	010	On that day,’ says the Lord of hosts, ‘you will each invite your neighbour under the vine and under the fig tree.’
038	ZEC	004	001	Then the messenger who talked with me came again and woke me, as someone who is woken from sleep.
038	ZEC	004	002	He said to me, ‘What do you see?’ I said, ‘I see a candlestick, all of gold, with a bowl on its top, and seven lamps on it. There are seven pipes to each of the lamps, which are on its top,
038	ZEC	004	003	and two olive trees next to it, one on the right side of the bowl, and the other on its left side.’
038	ZEC	004	004	I said to the messenger who talked with me, ‘What are these, my lord?’
038	ZEC	004	005	Then the messenger who talked with me answered, ‘Don’t you know what these are?’ And I said. ‘No, my lord.’
038	ZEC	004	006	He said to me, ‘This is the message of the Lord regarding Zerubbabel: Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, says the Lord of hosts,
038	ZEC	004	007	will I make the great mountain before Zerubbabel a plain. He will bring forth the top stones with shoutings of, “Grace, grace, to it.”’
038	ZEC	004	008	Moreover this message of the Lord came to me:
038	ZEC	004	009	The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house. His hands will also finish it. Then you will know that the Lord of hosts has sent me to you.
038	ZEC	004	010	For who has despised the day of small things? They will rejoice, and will see the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel. (The seven lamps are the eyes of the Lord that search all around the world.)
038	ZEC	004	011	Again I asked, ‘What are these two olive trees on the right side of the candlestick and on its left side?’
038	ZEC	004	012	Again, ‘What are these two branches of the olive trees, which are pouring out the golden oil through the two golden pipes?’
038	ZEC	004	013	He answered me, ‘Don’t you now what these are?’ And I said, ‘No, my lord.’
038	ZEC	004	014	Then he explained, ‘They are the two anointed ones who attend the Lord of all the earth.’
038	ZEC	005	001	Then again I looked up and saw a flying scroll.
038	ZEC	005	002	He said to me, ‘What do you see?’ I answered, ‘I see a flying scroll; twenty cubits long, ten cubits wide.’
038	ZEC	005	003	Then he said to me, ‘This is the curse that goes over the whole land. Every thief will be banished according to the writing on one side and everyone who lies under oath will be banished according to the writing on the other side.
038	ZEC	005	004	I have sent it out, says the Lord of hosts, and it will enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of anyone who swears falsely by my name. It will remain in the midst of his house and will consume it with its timber and its stones.’
038	ZEC	005	005	Then the messenger who talked with me came forward, and said to me, ‘Look up and see what is now coming.’
038	ZEC	005	006	I said. ‘What is it?’ He said, ‘It is a measuring basket, full of the guilt of the land.’
038	ZEC	005	007	A round leaden cover was lifted up, and there was a woman sitting in the middle of the basket.
038	ZEC	005	008	He said, ‘This is Wickedness.’ He thrust her down into the midst of the basket and he pushed the round leaden cover back on its mouth.
038	ZEC	005	009	Then I looked up and saw two women, and the wind was in their wings. They had wings like the wings of a stork and they lifted up the basket between them.
038	ZEC	005	010	Then I said to the messenger who talked with me, ‘Where are they taking the basket?’
038	ZEC	005	011	He said to me, ‘To build her a house in the land of Shinar. When it is prepared, they will rest the basket there.’
038	ZEC	006	001	Again I looked up, and saw four chariots come from between two mountains. The mountains were mountains of bronze.
038	ZEC	006	002	The first chariot had red horses. The second chariot had black horses,
038	ZEC	006	003	the third chariot white horses, and the fourth chariot dappled horses.
038	ZEC	006	004	Then I said to the messenger who talked with me, ‘What are these, my lord?’
038	ZEC	006	005	The messenger answered me, ‘These are the four winds of heaven going out after standing before the Lord of all the earth.
038	ZEC	006	006	The black horses are going toward the north country and the white toward the west and the dappled toward the south country.’
038	ZEC	006	007	The strong horses came out, and were impatient to patrol the earth. So he said, ‘Go, patrol the earth,’ and they did so.
038	ZEC	006	008	Then he cried out to me, ‘The horses that went to the north country will quiet my spirit in the north country.’
038	ZEC	006	009	Now this message of the Lord came to me:
038	ZEC	006	010	Take the gifts from the exiles Heldai, Tobijah and Jedaiah who have come from Babylon and go at once to Josiah the son of Zephaniah.
038	ZEC	006	011	Take their silver and gold and make a crown and set it on the head of the high priest, Joshua son of Jehozadak.
038	ZEC	006	012	Tell him: ‘Thus says the Lord of hosts: Behold, the man whose name is the Branch. He will branch out from his place and rebuild the temple of the Lord.
038	ZEC	006	013	He will rebuild the temple and will sit and rule upon his throne, receiving the honour due to a king. A priest will stand by his throne and they will work together in peace and harmony.
038	ZEC	006	014	The crown will be a memorial in the temple of the Lord for Heldai and Tobijah and Jedaiah, and Josiah the son of Zephaniah.
038	ZEC	006	015	People from far away will come and build in the temple of the Lord and you will know that the Lord of hosts has sent me to you. This will happen if you diligently obey the voice of the Lord your God.’
038	ZEC	007	001	In the fourth year of the reign of King Darius, on the fourth day of Chislev, the ninth month, the message of the Lord came to Zechariah.
038	ZEC	007	002	The city of Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regem-melech and their men, to entreat the favour of the Lord,
038	ZEC	007	003	and to ask the priests of the house of the Lord of hosts, and the prophets ‘Should I continue to mourn in the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done for many years?’
038	ZEC	007	004	Then this message of the Lord of hosts came to me:
038	ZEC	007	005	Tell all the people of the land and the priests, ‘When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and in the seventh month, for these seventy years, did you really fast for me?
038	ZEC	007	006	When you eat and when you drink, do you not eat for yourselves, and drink for yourselves?
038	ZEC	007	007	Wasn’t it this which the Lord proclaimed by the earlier prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and prosperous, and her towns surrounding her and the Negreb and the Shephelah were inhabited?’
038	ZEC	007	008	The Lord gave this message to Zechariah:
038	ZEC	007	009	The Lord of hosts says, execute true judgments. Show kindness and mercy to each other.
038	ZEC	007	010	Do not oppress the widow or the orphan, the resident foreigner or the poor. Let none of you devise evil against another in your hearts.
038	ZEC	007	011	But they refused to listen, and turned a stubborn shoulder, and stopped their ears so they wouldn’t hear.
038	ZEC	007	012	They made their hearts as hard as stone so they wouldn’t accept the teaching and the words that the Lord of hosts had sent by his spirit through the earlier prophets. Great was the anger of the Lord of hosts:
038	ZEC	007	013	I called and they would not hear, so they call and I do not hear, says the Lord of hosts.
038	ZEC	007	014	I scattered them by a whirlwind out among nations unknown to them. The land was left desolate behind them, with no one crossing or returning, for they made the pleasant land a desolation.
038	ZEC	008	001	Now this message of the Lord of hosts came to me:
038	ZEC	008	002	The Lord of hosts says: I passionately care for Zion, and I am fiercely protective of her.
038	ZEC	008	003	The Lord says, I have returned to Zion, and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem and Jerusalem will be called, “The City of Truth” and the mountain of the Lord of hosts, “The Holy Mountain.”
038	ZEC	008	004	The Lord of hosts says: Old men and old women will sit again in the squares of Jerusalem, each leaning on a staff because of old age.
038	ZEC	008	005	And the streets of the city will be full of boys, and of girls playing in its squares.
038	ZEC	008	006	The Lord of hosts says: Just because it seems impossible to the remnant of this people in these days, is it also impossible for me? says the Lord of hosts.
038	ZEC	008	007	The Lord of hosts says: I will rescue my people from the land of the east and the land of the west.
038	ZEC	008	008	I will bring them and they will live in Jerusalem, and they will be my people, and I will be their God, in truth and righteousness.
038	ZEC	008	009	The Lord of hosts says: Let your hands be strong, you who hear in these days the words of the prophets spoken when the foundations for the house of the Lord of hosts were laid.
038	ZEC	008	010	For before those days there were no wages for people or animals. No one could go out or return safe from enemies, because I set each against their neighbour.
038	ZEC	008	011	But now I will treat the remnant of the people differently from former days, says the Lord of hosts.
038	ZEC	008	012	Peace will be sown. The vine will bear its fruit and the ground will yield its produce, and the skies will give their dew. I will give the remnant of this people all these things.
038	ZEC	008	013	Just as you were accursed among the nations, house of Judah and house of Israel, so I will save you and you will be a blessing. Do not be afraid, but let your hands be strong.
038	ZEC	008	014	For the Lord of hosts says: As I planned to do evil to you when your ancestors provoked me to anger, says the Lord of hosts, and I did not relent,
038	ZEC	008	015	so again have I planned in these days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. Do not be afraid.
038	ZEC	008	016	These are the things that you should do: Speak the truth to each other. Render peaceful decisions in your gates.
038	ZEC	008	017	Let none of you devise evil in your heart against one another. Do not love perjury. All these are things I hate, says the Lord.
038	ZEC	008	018	And this message of the Lord of hosts came to me:
038	ZEC	008	019	The Lord of hosts says: The fast of the fourth month, and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth, will be festivals of joy and gladness, and cheerful feasts for the house of Judah. Therefore love truth and peace.
038	ZEC	008	020	The Lord of hosts says: Peoples, and the inhabitants of many cities will come,
038	ZEC	008	021	and the inhabitants of one city will go to another, saying, ‘Let us go speedily to entreat the favour of the Lord, and to seek the Lord of hosts; I will go also.’
038	ZEC	008	022	Many peoples and strong nations will come to seek the Lord of hosts in Jerusalem, and to entreat the favour of the Lord.
038	ZEC	008	023	The Lord of hosts says: In those days ten people from all languages and nations will take hold of the robe of a Jew, saying, ‘We will go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.’
038	ZEC	009	001	An oracle: The message of the Lord concerns the land of Hadrach, it rests upon Damascus. For the capital of Aram belongs to the Lord, as the tribes of Israel do,
038	ZEC	009	002	and also Hamath which borders on it. Tyre and Sidon, for all their wisdom.
038	ZEC	009	003	Tyre built for herself a fortress. Heaped up silver as dust, and gold like the dirt of the streets.
038	ZEC	009	004	But now the Lord will dispossess her, cast down her rampart into the sea. She will be consumed in fire.
038	ZEC	009	005	Ashkelon will see and fear, and Gaza writhe in anguish, Ekron, also for her hope will be put to shame. The king will perish from Gaza, Ashkelon will remain uninhabited.
038	ZEC	009	006	A foreign people will settle in Ashdod, and I will humble the pride of the Philistines.
038	ZEC	009	007	I will take their blood from their mouth, and their abominations from between their teeth. They also will be a remnant for our God, like a tribe in Judah, and Ekron will be like the Jebusites.
038	ZEC	009	008	But I will encamp as a guard about my house, so that none will pass through or return, and no oppressor will pass through them again, for now I have seen with my own eyes.
038	ZEC	009	009	Rejoice greatly, daughter of Zion! Shout aloud, daughter of Jerusalem! Look, your king comes to you. Vindicated and victorious is he, humble, and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey.
038	ZEC	009	010	He will cut off chariots from Ephraim, and war horses from Jerusalem. The battle bow will be cut off, and he will speak peace to the nations. His rule will be from sea to sea, from the river to the ends of the earth.
038	ZEC	009	011	And you, too – because of your blood covenant, I have set free your prisoners from the waterless pit.
038	ZEC	009	012	To the stronghold will the prisoners of hope return. This day I declare, I will restore double to you.
038	ZEC	009	013	For I have bent Judah to me, like a bow which I have filled with Ephraim like an arrow. I will urge your sons, Zion, against the sons of Greece, I will make you like the sword of a hero.
038	ZEC	009	014	Then the Lord will be seen above them and his arrow will go forth like lightning. The Lord will blow a blast upon a trumpet, and travel on the whirlwinds of the south.
038	ZEC	009	015	The Lord of hosts will defend them. They will devour and tread down the slingstones, they will drink their blood like wine, they will be full like a bowl, like the crevices of the altar.
038	ZEC	009	016	And the Lord their God will save them on that day, as the flock of his people, as the jewel of a crown shining in his land.
038	ZEC	009	017	How good and how beautiful will it be! Corn will make the young men flourish and new wine the young women!
038	ZEC	010	001	Ask from the Lord rain, at the time of spring rain, from the Lord who forms the storm clouds, and the showers of rain he gives to you, and green in the field.
038	ZEC	010	002	But the household gods speak nonsense, and the diviners see lies, and relate idle dreams. In vain they offer comfort, so the people wander like sheep, They suffer because there is no shepherd.
038	ZEC	010	003	My wrath is hot against the shepherds, and on the leaders will I bring punishment. For the Lord cares for his flock, the house of Judah, and will make them his splendid war steeds.
038	ZEC	010	004	From Judah will come the cornerstone and the stay, from them the battle bow, from them goes forth every commander.
038	ZEC	010	005	Together they will trample on warriors, as on the dirt of the streets in battle. They fight, for the Lord is with them, putting the riders on horses to shame.
038	ZEC	010	006	I will make strong the house of Judah, I will bring deliverance to the house of Joseph, I will bring them back for I have compassion on them, they will be as if I had not driven them away. For I am the Lord their God and will answer them.
038	ZEC	010	007	The Ephraimites will be like warriors, their hearts will rejoice as with wine, their children will see and rejoice. Their hearts will exult in the Lord.
038	ZEC	010	008	I will whistle for them, and gather them, and they will be as many as they once were.
038	ZEC	010	009	I will sow them among the peoples, but in distant lands they will remember me, and they will bring up their children and come back.
038	ZEC	010	010	I will bring them home from the land of Egypt, and from Assyria will I gather them. Into the land of Gilead and Lebanon I will bring them, until the land overflows with them.
038	ZEC	010	011	And when they pass through the sea of distress, I will strike down the waves of the sea, and all the deeps of the Nile will be dried up. The pride of Assyria will be brought low and the sceptre of Egypt turned aside.
038	ZEC	010	012	I will make them strong in the Lord, they will walk in his name, says the Lord.
038	ZEC	011	001	Open your doors, Lebanon, so that fire may devour your cedars.
038	ZEC	011	002	Wail, pine-tree, for the cedar is fallen. Wail, oaks of Bashan, for the inaccessible forest has fallen.
038	ZEC	011	003	Listen to the wailing of the shepherds! Their glory is destroyed. Listen to the roaring of young lions! Blasted is the thick forest of the Jordan.
038	ZEC	011	004	The Lord said to me: shepherd the flock destined for slaughter,
038	ZEC	011	005	whose possessors slaughter them, and hold themselves not guilty! The people who sell them say, Blessed be the Lord, for I am rich! And their own shepherds have no compassion for them.
038	ZEC	011	006	I will no longer have pity on the people of this earth, says the Lord. I will turn neighbour against neighbour, and put everyone under the power of a king, and when the land is devastated I will not rescue them.
038	ZEC	011	007	So I shepherded the flock of slaughter for the sheep-merchants. I took two staffs: one I called Mercy and the other I called Union. So I shepherded the sheep.
038	ZEC	011	008	I set aside three of the shepherds in one month; for I was indignant against them, and they also were displeased at me.
038	ZEC	011	009	I said, I will not shepherd you. What is dead, let it die. What is set aside, let it be set aside. And let those who are left devour one another’s flesh.
038	ZEC	011	010	And I took my staff, Mercy, and broke it, so as to break my covenant which I had made with all the peoples.
038	ZEC	011	011	In that day it was broken, and the sheep-merchants who watched me knew that it was the Lord’s message.
038	ZEC	011	012	And I said to them, ‘If it is good in your sight, give me my wage. If not, don’t.’ So they weighed out my wage, thirty pieces of silver.
038	ZEC	011	013	And the Lord said to me, Cast it into the treasury – the precious wage that at which I was valued by them! So I took the thirty pieces of silver and cast them into the house of the Lord, into the treasury.
038	ZEC	011	014	Then I broke my second staff called Union so as to dissolve the brotherhood between Judah and Jerusalem.
038	ZEC	011	015	And the Lord said to me: Take again the implements of a worthless shepherd.
038	ZEC	011	016	For I am about to appoint a shepherd over the land. Those who are thrust down he will not visit. Those who are scattered he will not seek out. The wounded he will not heal, the sick he will not make whole, but the flesh of the fat he will devour and even their hoofs he will tear.
038	ZEC	011	017	Woe to my worthless shepherd, who deserts the flock! May the sword strike his arm and his right eye. May his arm completely wither. And his right eye be blinded.
038	ZEC	012	001	An oracle. This is the message of the Lord about Israel. The Lord who stretches out the heavens, and lays the foundation of the earth, and forms the human spirit within people says:
038	ZEC	012	002	Look! I am about to make Jerusalem a cup of drunkenness for all the surrounding peoples. There will be a siege of Jerusalem.
038	ZEC	012	003	On that day that I will make Jerusalem a stone to be lifted up by all the peoples. All who lift it up will surely hurt themselves! And all the nations of the earth will be gathered together against it.
038	ZEC	012	004	On that day, says the Lord, I will strike every horse with panic and its rider with madness. But over the house of Judah I will keep watch, though I strike every horse belonging to the peoples with blindness.
038	ZEC	012	005	And the chieftains of Judah will say to themselves, ‘The strength of the inhabitants is in the Lord of hosts their God.’
038	ZEC	012	006	In that day I will make the chieftains of Judah like a pan of fire in the woods, like a torch among sheaves, they will devour right and left all the surrounding peoples. But Jerusalem will abide on its own site.
038	ZEC	012	007	And the Lord will first give victory to the tents of Judah, so that the glory of the house of David, and of the inhabitants of Jerusalem be not exalted above Judah.
038	ZEC	012	008	In that day the Lord will protect the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the feeblest among them will in that day be like David, and the house of David like God, like the messenger of the Lord before them.
038	ZEC	012	009	And in that day I will seek to destroy all the nations who have come up against Jerusalem.
038	ZEC	012	010	And I will pour out on the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of pity and compassion. They will look on him whom they have pierced and they will lament for him as one laments for an only son. They will bitterly grieve for him as one grieves for the firstborn.
038	ZEC	012	011	In that day mourning will be as great in Jerusalem as the mourning for Hadad-rimmon in the plain of Megiddo.
038	ZEC	012	012	And the land will mourn, each family by itself: the family of the house of David by itself, and their wives by themselves, and the family of the house of Nathan by itself, and their wives by themselves,
038	ZEC	012	013	and the family of the house of Levi by itself, and their wives by themselves, the family of the Shimeites by itself, and their wives by themselves,
038	ZEC	012	014	and all the families who are left, each by itself, and their wives by themselves.
038	ZEC	013	001	On that day a fountain will be opened for the house of David, and for the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for uncleanness.
038	ZEC	013	002	And it will be on that day, says the Lord of hosts, I will cut off the names of the idols from the land and they will be remembered no more. And the prophets and the unclean spirit I will banish from the land.
038	ZEC	013	003	If any man prophesy any more, his father and his mother who bore him, will say to him, ‘You will not live, for you speak falsehood in the name of the Lord.’ And his father and his mother who bore him will stab him through when he is seized by the prophetic frenzy.
038	ZEC	013	004	And it will be in that day that the prophets will be ashamed, each of his vision, and will not wear the hairy mantle in order to deceive.
038	ZEC	013	005	Each will say, ‘I am not a prophet, a tiller of the ground am I, for the ground is my possession from my youth.’
038	ZEC	013	006	And they will say to him, ‘What are these scars on your back?’ And he will say, ‘The scars which I received in the house of my friends.’
038	ZEC	013	007	Awake, sword, against my shepherd, against the man who stands near to me, says the Lord of hosts. I will strike the shepherd so that the sheep may be scattered, I will turn my hand against the little ones.
038	ZEC	013	008	In all the land, says the Lord, two-thirds in it will be cut off and die, but a third will be left in it.
038	ZEC	013	009	I will bring the third into the fire, and melt it as one melts silver, and test it as one tests gold. Then they will call on my name, and I myself will answer them. I will say, ‘They are my people.’ They will say, ‘The Lord is our God.’
038	ZEC	014	001	A day is coming for the Lord, when your plundered possessions will be divided while you watch.
038	ZEC	014	002	And all the nations will gather to Jerusalem, to fight against it. The city will be taken and the houses plundered and the women raped. Half of the city will go into captivity, and the rest of the people left in the ruins.
038	ZEC	014	003	Then the Lord will go forth and fight against these nations, as once he fought in the day of battle.
038	ZEC	014	004	On that day his feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, (which is opposite Jerusalem, on the east). The Mount of Olives will be split into halves, from east to west, by an exceedingly great valley; and half of the mountain will slide northwards and half southwards.
038	ZEC	014	005	You will escape through my valley – the valley between the hills will extend as far as Azel, and you will flee as you fled from before the earthquake, in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. But the Lord your God will come, and all the holy ones with him.
038	ZEC	014	006	And in that day, there will be no heat nor cold nor frost,
038	ZEC	014	007	but it will be constant day – it is known to the Lord – with neither day nor night. Even at evening time there will be light.
038	ZEC	014	008	And on that day living waters will flow from Jerusalem, half of them to the eastern sea and half of them to the western sea; in both summer and winter.
038	ZEC	014	009	The Lord will be king over all the earth. On that day the Lord will be one, and his name one.
038	ZEC	014	010	The land will be changed to plain, from Geba to Rimmon, south of Jerusalem, but Jerusalem will be high and inhabited as it stands, from the Benjamin Gate up to the place of the first gate, and from the Tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate, and as far as the king’s winepresses.
038	ZEC	014	011	Jerusalem will be inhabited, for never again will it be doomed to destruction, and its people will abide in security.
038	ZEC	014	012	This is the plague with which the Lord will strike all the peoples who array themselves against Jerusalem: he will make their flesh rot while they stand on their feet, and their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongues will rot in their mouth.
038	ZEC	014	013	On that day a great panic sent by the Lord will fall on them. Everyone will seize their neighbours and attack them.
038	ZEC	014	014	Even Judah will fight at Jerusalem, and the wealth of the surrounding nations will be gathered up – gold and silver and piles of clothing.
038	ZEC	014	015	Plague will fall upon the horses, mules, camels, and donkeys, and on all the animals in all those camps.
038	ZEC	014	016	All who are left of all the nations which fought against Jerusalem will come up from year to year to worship the King, the Lord of hosts, and to keep the pilgrim-feast of tabernacles.
038	ZEC	014	017	Whoever of all the peoples of the earth will not come up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the Lord of hosts, on them there will be no rain.
038	ZEC	014	018	If the family of Egypt does not go up nor enter in, on them also will come the plague with which the Lord will strike the nations.
038	ZEC	014	019	This will be the punishment for the sin of Egypt and the punishment for the sin of all nations which do not come up to keep the feast of the tabernacles.
038	ZEC	014	020	On that day there will be inscribed upon the bells of the horses, “Holy to the Lord” and the pots in the house of the Lord will be as holy as the sacrificial bowls before the altars.
038	ZEC	014	021	Every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah will be holy to the Lord of hosts and all who sacrifice will come and take of them and cook the sacrifices in them. There will be no more traffickers in the house of the Lord of hosts in that day.

# BOOK	039	MAL	Malachi	Malachi
039	MAL	001	001	An oracle. The message of the Lord to Israel through Malachi.
039	MAL	001	002	‘I have loved you,’ says the Lord. ‘But you ask, “How have you shown love to us?” Was not Esau Jacob’s brother?’ explains the Lord of hosts, ‘yet I loved Jacob,
039	MAL	001	003	but hated Esau, and made his mountains a desolation, and transformed his ancestral land into a wilderness.
039	MAL	001	004	When Edom says, “We are beaten down, but we will return and rebuild the ruined places”’ the Lord of hosts says, ‘They may build, but I will throw down. They will be called, “The border land of wickedness,” the people against whom the Lord is angry forever.
039	MAL	001	005	Your own eyes will see this, and you will say, “the Lord’s greatness reaches beyond the border of Israel.”’
039	MAL	001	006	‘A son honours his father and servant their master. If I am a father, where is my honour? And if I am a master, where is the one who fears me? So says the Lord to you, priests who despise my name. You ask, “How have we despised your name?”
039	MAL	001	007	You offer on my altar bread that is polluted. You ask, “How have we polluted it?” Because you say, “The table of the Lord is contemptible.”
039	MAL	001	008	When you offer the blind animal for sacrifice, “It doesn’t matter!” And when you offer the lame and the sick “It doesn’t matter!” Give an animal like that to your governor; will he be pleased with it? Will he receive you favourably?’ says the Lord of hosts.
039	MAL	001	009	Now, plead for the favour of God with such an offering, so that he may be gracious to us. ‘Would I receive any of you favourably?’ says the Lord of hosts.
039	MAL	001	010	‘If only one of you would shut the temple doors, so that you could not kindle useless fires on my altar! I have no pleasure in you,’ says the Lord of hosts, ‘Nor will I accept an offering from your hand.
039	MAL	001	011	For from the rising of the sun to its setting my name is great among the nations, and in every place they offer to my name a pure offering. For my name is great among the nations,’ says the Lord of hosts.
039	MAL	001	012	‘But you profane me when you say, “The table of the Lord is polluted, and its food is contemptible.”
039	MAL	001	013	You say also, “How tired we are of all this!” and you sniff contemptuously at it. You have brought the blind, the lame and the sick as offerings. Should I accept this from your hand?’ says the Lord of hosts.
039	MAL	001	014	‘Cursed be the cheat, who has in his flock a valuable male, but vows and sacrifices to the Lord a blemished animal! For I am a great king,’ says the Lord of hosts, ‘and my name is feared among the nations.’
039	MAL	002	001	‘Now, you priests, this command is for you.
039	MAL	002	002	If you will not hear, and if you do not take it to heart, to give glory to my name,’ says the Lord of hosts, ‘Then I will lay a curse on you. I will turn your blessings into curses. Indeed I have already done so, because you pay no attention.
039	MAL	002	003	I will punish your descendants! I will spread offal upon your faces, even the offal of your pilgrim feasts, you will be discarded.
039	MAL	002	004	You will then know that I have sent this command to you, so that my covenant with Levi may be preserved,’ says the Lord of hosts.
039	MAL	002	005	‘My covenant with him was to give life and peace. I gave them to him so that he might revere me. He revered me, and stood in awe of my name.
039	MAL	002	006	The true instruction was in his mouth, and injustice was not found in his lips; He walked with me in peace and uprightness, and turned many away from iniquity.
039	MAL	002	007	For the priest’s lips should keep knowledge, and people should seek the law from his mouth, because he is the messenger of the Lord of hosts.
039	MAL	002	008	‘But you have turned aside from that way. You have caused many to stumble in the law. You have corrupted the covenant of Levi,’ says the Lord of hosts.
039	MAL	002	009	‘So I have I made you contemptible and degraded before all the people, because you have not kept my ways, and have had no respect for me in imparting the law.’
039	MAL	002	010	Don’t we have all one father? Didn’t one God created us? Why do we deal faithlessly with one another, profaning the covenant of our ancestors?
039	MAL	002	011	Judah is treacherous, and abominations are committed in Israel and in Jerusalem because Judah has profaned the holy things loved by the Lord, and has married the daughter of a foreign god.
039	MAL	002	012	May the Lord banish from the community of Jacob anyone who does this, anyone awaking, testifying, and making an offering to the Lord of hosts.
039	MAL	002	013	And you also do this: You cover the altar of the Lord with tears, because he doesn’t accept the offering any more, doesn’t accept it from your hand.
039	MAL	002	014	Yet you ask, ‘Why?’ Because the Lord is testifying against you on behalf of the wife you married when you were young. You have been unfaithful to her, even though she is your companion, and your legal wife.
039	MAL	002	015	Did not the one God make everyone, so that all both flesh and spirit is his? And what does that one God seek but godly children? Therefore keep watch over your spirit, and let none of you deal faithlessly with the wife of your youth.
039	MAL	002	016	‘A man who divorces or puts away his wife,’ says Lord, the God of Israel, ‘overwhelms her with cruelty.’ The Lord of hosts says: ‘Keep watch over your spirit, do not be unfaithful.’
039	MAL	002	017	You have wearied the Lord with your words. You ask, ‘How have we wearied him?’ By saying, ‘Everyone who does evil is good in the sight of the Lord, and he delights in them.’ Or, ‘Where is the God of justice?’
039	MAL	003	001	‘I am about to send my messenger and he will clear a path before me: And the Lord, who you are seeking, will suddenly come to his temple. The messenger of the covenant who you long for is already coming, says the Lord of hosts.
039	MAL	003	002	But who can endure the day of his coming? And who will stand firm when he appears? He is like a refiner’s fire, and like a launderer’s soap,
039	MAL	003	003	and he will sit as a refiner and purifier. He will purify the descendants of Levi, and refine them like gold and silver, until they are fit to bring offerings to the Lord.
039	MAL	003	004	Then will the offerings of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant to the Lord, as in the days of old, and as in former years.
039	MAL	003	005	‘I will come to you in judgment. I will be quick to testify against the sorcerers, adulterers, perjurers, those who cheat workers, or widows, or orphans, deny justice to immigrants, and do not fear me,’ says the Lord of hosts.
039	MAL	003	006	‘For I, the Lord, do not change; and you have not ceased to be descendants of Jacob.’
039	MAL	003	007	‘From the days of your ancestors, you have turned aside from my statutes, and you have not kept them. Turn to me and I will turn to you,’ says the Lord. ‘You say, “How should we turn?”
039	MAL	003	008	Can a human rob God? Yet you robbed me. You ask, “How have we robbed you?” In tithes and gifts!
039	MAL	003	009	You – your entire nation – are all cursed, because you rob me.
039	MAL	003	010	‘Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, so that there is food in my house. Test me in this way. See if I will not open to you the windows of the sky, and pour you out a blessing, until there is more than enough.
039	MAL	003	011	I will rebuke for your sakes the devouring locust and he will not destroy your crops, nor will the vine fail to ripen its fruit in the field, says the Lord of hosts,
039	MAL	003	012	and all nations will call you happy, for you will be a delightful land,’ says the Lord of hosts.
039	MAL	003	013	‘You have said terrible things about me,’ says the Lord. ‘You ask, “What have we said about you?”
039	MAL	003	014	You have said, “It is useless to serve God, and what do we gain from the Lord of hosts by keeping his commands, and walking mournfully in funeral garb before him?
039	MAL	003	015	So now we call the proud happy, evildoers thrive: they dare God and escape unharmed.”’
039	MAL	003	016	Such things those who revered the Lord spoke to one another, and the Lord took notice, and a record was written before him of those who revered the Lord and those who keep in mind his name.
039	MAL	003	017	‘They will be mine,’ says the Lord of hosts, ‘my special possession on that day that I am preparing. I will spare them as a man spares his son who serves him.
039	MAL	003	018	Once again my people will see the difference between the righteous and the wicked, between the person who serves God and the person who does not.’
039	MAL	004	001	‘The day is coming that will burn like a furnace, and all the proud and all evildoers will be stubble, and the day that is coming will burn them up,’ says the Lord of hosts, ‘leaving neither root nor branch.
039	MAL	004	002	But to you who revere my name there will arise the sun of righteousness with healing in its wings, and you will run free like calves let out from their stall.
039	MAL	004	003	In the day when I act you will tread down the wicked, they will be as ashes under the soles of your feet,’ says the Lord of hosts.
039	MAL	004	004	‘Remember the law of Moses my servant, statutes and judgments which I gave him at Horeb for all Israel.
039	MAL	004	005	I am about to send to you Elijah the prophet, before the great and terrible day of the Lord comes.
039	MAL	004	006	He will turn fathers’ hearts to their sons and sons’ hearts to their fathers, so that I will not come and strike the earth with judgement.’

# BOOK	040	MAT	Matthew	Matthew
040	MAT	001	001	A genealogy of Jesus Christ, a descendant of David and Abraham.
040	MAT	001	002	Abraham was the father of Isaac, Isaac of Jacob, Jacob of Judah and his brothers,
040	MAT	001	003	Judah of Perez and Zerah, whose mother was Tamar, Perez of Hezron, Hezron of Aram,
040	MAT	001	004	Aram of Aminadab, Aminadab of Nahshon, Nahshon of Salmon,
040	MAT	001	005	Salmon of Boaz, whose mother was Rahab, Boaz of Obed, whose mother was Ruth, Obed of Jesse,
040	MAT	001	006	Jesse of David the King. David was the father of Solomon, whose mother was Uriah’s widow,
040	MAT	001	007	Solomon of Rehoboam, Rehoboam of Abijah, Abijah of Asa,
040	MAT	001	008	Asa of Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat of Joram, Joram of Uzziah,
040	MAT	001	009	Uzziah of Jotham, Jotham of Ahaz, Ahaz of Hezekiah,
040	MAT	001	010	Hezekiah of Manasseh, Manasseh of Amon, Amon of Josiah,
040	MAT	001	011	Josiah of Jechoniah and his brothers, at the time of the Exile to Babylon.
040	MAT	001	012	After the Exile to Babylon – Jechoniah was the father of Salathiel, Salathiel of Zerubbabel,
040	MAT	001	013	Zerubbabel of Abiud, Abiud of Eliakim, Eliakim of Azor,
040	MAT	001	014	Azor of Zadok, Zadok of Achim, Achim of Eliud,
040	MAT	001	015	Eliud of Eleazar, Eleazar of Matthan, Matthan of Jacob,
040	MAT	001	016	Jacob of Joseph, the husband of Mary, who was the mother of Jesus, who is called “Christ”.
040	MAT	001	017	So the whole number of generations from Abraham to David is fourteen; from David to the Exile to Babylon fourteen; and from the Exile to Babylon to the Christ fourteen.
040	MAT	001	018	This is how Jesus Christ was born: His mother Mary was engaged to Joseph, but, before the marriage took place, she found herself to be pregnant by the power of the Holy Spirit.
040	MAT	001	019	Her husband, Joseph, was a just man and, since he did not want to disgrace her publicly, he resolved to put an end to their engagement privately.
040	MAT	001	020	He had been thinking this over, when an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream. ‘Joseph, son of David,’ the angel said, ‘do not be afraid to take Mary for your wife, for her child has been conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit.
040	MAT	001	021	She will give birth to a son; name him Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.’
040	MAT	001	022	All this happened in fulfilment of these words of the Lord through the prophet, where he says –
040	MAT	001	023	“The virgin will conceive and will give birth to a son, and they will give him the name Immanuel” – a word which means “God is with us.”
040	MAT	001	024	When Joseph woke up, he did as the angel of the Lord had directed him.
040	MAT	001	025	He made Mary his wife, but they did not sleep together before the birth of her son; and to this son he gave the name Jesus.
040	MAT	002	001	After the birth of Jesus at Bethlehem in Judea, in the reign of King Herod, some astrologers from the East arrived in Jerusalem, asking,
040	MAT	002	002	‘Where is the newborn king of the Jews? For we saw his star in the east, and have come to worship him.’
040	MAT	002	003	When King Herod heard of this, he was much troubled, and so too was all Jerusalem.
040	MAT	002	004	He called together all the chief priests and teachers of the Law in the nation, and questioned them as to where the Christ was to be born.
040	MAT	002	005	‘At Bethlehem in Judea,’ was their answer, ‘for it is said in the prophet –
040	MAT	002	006	“And you, Bethlehem in Judah’s land, are in no way least among the chief cities of Judah, for out of you will come a ruler – who will shepherd my people Israel.”’
040	MAT	002	007	Then Herod secretly sent for the astrologers. He found out from them the time of the appearance of the star.
040	MAT	002	008	Sending them to Bethlehem he said, ‘Go and make a careful search for the child. When you have found him, bring word back to me, so that I, too, can go and worship him.’
040	MAT	002	009	The astrologers heard what the king had to say, and then continued their journey. The star which they had seen in the east led them on, until it reached and stood over the place where the child was.
040	MAT	002	010	At the sight of the star they were filled with joy.
040	MAT	002	011	Entering the house, they saw the child with his mother, Mary, and fell at his feet and worshipped him. Then they opened their treasure chests, and offered to the child presents of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
040	MAT	002	012	But afterwards, having been warned in a dream not to go back to Herod, they returned to their own country by another road.
040	MAT	002	013	After they had left, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, and said, ‘Get up, take the child and his mother, and seek refuge in Egypt; and stay there until I tell you to return, for Herod is about to search for the child, to put him to death.’
040	MAT	002	014	Joseph woke up, and taking the child and his mother by night, went into Egypt,
040	MAT	002	015	and there he stayed until Herod’s death. This was in fulfilment of these words of the Lord in the prophet, where he says – “Out of Egypt I called my Son.”
040	MAT	002	016	When Herod found out that the astrologers had tricked him, he flew into a rage. He sent and put to death all the boys in Bethlehem and the whole of that region, who were two years old or under, guided by the time which he had learned from the astrologers.
040	MAT	002	017	Then were fulfilled these words spoken in the prophet Jeremiah, where he says –
040	MAT	002	018	“A voice was heard in Ramah, weeping and mourning loudly; Rachel, weeping for her children, refusing all comfort for they were dead.”
040	MAT	002	019	But, on the death of Herod, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, and said,
040	MAT	002	020	‘Get up, take the child and his mother, and go into the Land of Israel, for those who sought to take the child’s life are dead.’
040	MAT	002	021	He woke up, and taking the child and his mother, went into the Land of Israel.
040	MAT	002	022	But, hearing that Archelaus had succeeded his father Herod as king of Judea, he was afraid to go back there; and having been warned in a dream, he went into the part of the country called Galilee.
040	MAT	002	023	There he settled in the town of Nazareth, in fulfilment of these words in the prophets – “He will be called a Nazarene.”
040	MAT	003	001	About that time John the Baptist first appeared, proclaiming in the wilderness of Judea:
040	MAT	003	002	‘Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.’
040	MAT	003	003	John was the one who was spoken of in the prophet Isaiah, where he says – “The voice of one crying aloud in the wilderness: ‘Make ready the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.’”
040	MAT	003	004	John’s clothes were made of camels’ hair, with a leather strap round his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey.
040	MAT	003	005	At that time Jerusalem, and all Judea, as well as the whole district of the Jordan, went out to him
040	MAT	003	006	and were baptised by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.
040	MAT	003	007	But when John saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to receive his baptism, he said to them, ‘You children of snakes! Who has prompted you to seek refuge from the coming judgment?
040	MAT	003	008	Let your life, then, prove your repentance;
040	MAT	003	009	and do not think that you can say among yourselves “Abraham is our ancestor,” for I tell you that out of these stones God is able to raise descendants for Abraham!
040	MAT	003	010	Already the axe is lying at the root of the trees. Therefore every tree that fails to bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.
040	MAT	003	011	I, indeed, baptise you with water to teach repentance; but he who is coming after me is more powerful than I, and I am not fit even to carry his sandals. He will baptise you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.
040	MAT	003	012	His winnowing-fan is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing-floor, and store his grain in the barn, but the chaff he will burn with a fire that cannot be put out.’
040	MAT	003	013	Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan, to John, to be baptised by him.
040	MAT	003	014	But John tried to prevent him. ‘I need to be baptised by you,’ he said, ‘so why have you come to me?’
040	MAT	003	015	‘This is the way it should be for now,’ Jesus answered, ‘because we should do everything that God requires.’ So John agreed.
040	MAT	003	016	After the baptism of Jesus, and just as he came up from the water, the heavens opened, and he saw the Spirit of God coming down like a dove and resting on him,
040	MAT	003	017	and from the heavens there came a voice which said, ‘This is my dearly loved son, who brings me great joy.’
040	MAT	004	001	Then Jesus was led up into the wilderness by the Spirit to be tempted by the devil.
040	MAT	004	002	And, after he had fasted for forty days and forty nights, he became hungry.
040	MAT	004	003	The Tempter came to him, and said: ‘If you are God’s Son, tell these stones to become loaves of bread.’
040	MAT	004	004	But Jesus answered, ‘Scripture says – “It is not on bread alone that a person is to live, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.”’
040	MAT	004	005	Then the devil took him to the Holy City, and, placing him on the parapet of the temple, said to him,
040	MAT	004	006	‘If you are God’s Son, throw yourself down, for scripture says – “He will give his angels commands about you, and on their hands they will lift you up, so you do not even strike your foot against a stone.”’
040	MAT	004	007	‘Scripture also says,’ answered Jesus, ‘“You must not tempt the Lord your God.”’
040	MAT	004	008	The third time, the devil took Jesus to a very high mountain, and, showing him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendour, said to him:
040	MAT	004	009	‘All these I will give you, if you will fall at my feet and worship me.’
040	MAT	004	010	Then Jesus said to him, ‘Go away, Satan! For scripture says – “You must worship the Lord your God, and worship him only.”’
040	MAT	004	011	Then the devil left him alone, and angels came and helped him.
040	MAT	004	012	When Jesus heard that John had been arrested, he returned to Galilee.
040	MAT	004	013	Afterwards, leaving Nazareth, he went and settled at Capernaum, which is by the side of the sea, within the borders of Zebulun and Naphtali;
040	MAT	004	014	in fulfilment of these words in the prophet Isaiah –
040	MAT	004	015	“The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, the land of the Road by the sea, and beyond the Jordan, with Galilee of the Gentiles –
040	MAT	004	016	The people who were living in darkness have seen a great light, and, for those who were living in the shadow-land of death, a light has dawned!”
040	MAT	004	017	At that time Jesus began to proclaim – ‘Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.’
040	MAT	004	018	As Jesus was walking along the shore of the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers – Simon, also known as Peter, and his brother Andrew – casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen.
040	MAT	004	019	‘Come and follow me,’ Jesus said, ‘and I will teach you to fish for people.’
040	MAT	004	020	The two men left their nets at once and followed him.
040	MAT	004	021	Going further on, he saw two other men who were also brothers, James, Zebedee’s son, and his brother John, in their boat with their father, mending their nets. Jesus called them,
040	MAT	004	022	and they at once left their boat and their father, and followed him.
040	MAT	004	023	Jesus went all through Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, and curing every kind of disease and every kind of sickness among the people;
040	MAT	004	024	and his fame spread all through Syria. They brought to him all who were ill with any form of disease, or who were suffering pain – any who were either possessed by demons, or were lunatic, or paralysed; and he cured them.
040	MAT	004	025	He was followed by large crowds from Galilee, the district of the Ten Towns, Jerusalem, Judea, and from beyond the Jordan.
040	MAT	005	001	On seeing the crowds of people, Jesus went up the hill; and, when he had taken his seat, his disciples came up to him;
040	MAT	005	002	and he began to teach them, saying:
040	MAT	005	003	‘Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
040	MAT	005	004	Blessed are the mourners, for they will be comforted.
040	MAT	005	005	Blessed are the gentle, for they will inherit the earth.
040	MAT	005	006	Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be satisfied.
040	MAT	005	007	Blessed are the merciful, for they will find mercy.
040	MAT	005	008	Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.
040	MAT	005	009	Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.
040	MAT	005	010	Blessed are those who have been persecuted in the cause of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
040	MAT	005	011	‘Blessed are you when people insult you, and persecute you, and say all kinds of evil lies about you because of me.
040	MAT	005	012	Be glad and rejoice, because your reward in heaven will be great; this is the way they persecuted the prophets who lived before you.
040	MAT	005	013	‘You are salt for the world. But if salt becomes tasteless, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, but is thrown away, and trampled underfoot.
040	MAT	005	014	It is you who are the light of the world. A town that stands on a hill cannot be hidden.
040	MAT	005	015	People do not light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on the lamp-stand, where it gives light to everyone in the house.
040	MAT	005	016	Let your light so shine before the eyes of others so that, seeing your good actions, they will praise your Father who is in heaven.
040	MAT	005	017	‘Do not think that I have come to do away with the Law or the prophets; I have not come to do away with them, but to complete them.
040	MAT	005	018	For I tell you, until the heavens and the earth disappear, not even the smallest letter, nor one stroke of a letter, will disappear from the Law until all is done.
040	MAT	005	019	Whoever, therefore, breaks one of these commandments, even the least of them, and teaches others to do so, will be the least esteemed in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever keeps them, and teaches others to do so, will be esteemed great in the kingdom of heaven.
040	MAT	005	020	Indeed I tell you that, unless you obey God’s commands better than of the teachers of the Law, and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.
040	MAT	005	021	‘You have heard that to our ancestors it was said – “You must not commit murder,” and “Whoever commits murder will be brought to trial.”
040	MAT	005	022	But I say to you that anyone who is angry at their brother or sister will be brought to trial; and whoever insults their brother or sister will be brought before the High Council, while whoever calls them a fool will be in danger of the fires of Gehenna.
040	MAT	005	023	Therefore, when presenting your gift at the altar, if even there you remember that your brother or sister has something against you,
040	MAT	005	024	leave your gift there, before the altar, go and be reconciled to them, first, then come and present your gift.
040	MAT	005	025	Be ready to make friends with your opponent, even when you meet them on your way to the court; otherwise they might hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the judicial officer, and you will be thrown into prison.
040	MAT	005	026	I tell you, you will not come out until you have paid the last cent.
040	MAT	005	027	‘You have heard that it was said – “You must not commit adultery.”
040	MAT	005	028	But I say to you that anyone who looks at a woman and desires her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
040	MAT	005	029	If your right eye causes you to sin, take it out and throw it away. It would be best for you to lose one part of your body, and not to have the whole of it thrown into Gehenna.
040	MAT	005	030	And, if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It would be best for you to lose one part of your body, and not to have the whole of it go down to Gehenna.
040	MAT	005	031	‘It was also said – “Let anyone who divorces his wife serve her with a notice of separation.”
040	MAT	005	032	But I say to you that anyone who divorces his wife, except on the ground of some serious sexual sin, leads to her committing adultery; while anyone who marries her after her divorce is guilty of adultery.
040	MAT	005	033	Again, you have heard that our ancestors were told – “Do not break your oaths, keep your vows to the Lord.”
040	MAT	005	034	But I say to you that you must not swear at all, either by heaven, since that is God’s throne,
040	MAT	005	035	or by the earth, since that is his footstool, or by Jerusalem, since that is the city of the Great King.
040	MAT	005	036	Nor should you swear by your head, since you cannot make a single hair either white or black.
040	MAT	005	037	Let your words be simply “Yes” or “No”; anything beyond this comes from what is evil.
040	MAT	005	038	‘You have heard that it was said – “An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.”
040	MAT	005	039	But I say to you that you must not resist those who wrong you; but, if anyone strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other to them also.
040	MAT	005	040	If someone sues you for your shirt, let them have your cloak as well.
040	MAT	005	041	If you are forced to carry a soldier’s pack for one mile, carry it two.
040	MAT	005	042	Give to anyone who asks and, if someone wants to borrow from you, do not turn them away.
040	MAT	005	043	You have heard that it was said – “You must love your neighbour and hate your enemy.”
040	MAT	005	044	But what I tell you is this: love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you,
040	MAT	005	045	so that you may become children of your Father who is in heaven; for he causes his sun to rise on bad and good alike, and sends rain on the righteous and on the unrighteous.
040	MAT	005	046	For, if you love only those who love you, what reward will you have? Even the tax collectors do this!
040	MAT	005	047	And, if you only welcome your brothers and sisters, what are you doing more than others? Even the Gentiles do this!
040	MAT	005	048	You, then, must become perfect – as your heavenly Father is perfect.
040	MAT	006	001	‘Take care not to perform your religious duties in public in order to be seen by others; if you do, your Father who is in heaven has no reward for you.
040	MAT	006	002	Therefore, when you do acts of charity, do not have a trumpet blown in front of you, as hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets so that people will praise them. There, I tell you, is their reward!
040	MAT	006	003	But, when you do acts of charity, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,
040	MAT	006	004	so that your charity may be secret; and your Father, who sees what is in secret, will reward you.
040	MAT	006	005	‘And, when you pray, you are not to behave as hypocrites do. They like to pray standing in the synagogues and at the corners of the streets, so that people will see them. There, I tell you, is their reward!
040	MAT	006	006	But, when one of you prays, they should go into their own room, shut the door, and pray to their Father who dwells in secret; and their Father, who sees what is secret, will reward them.
040	MAT	006	007	When praying, do not repeat the same words over and over again, as is done by the Gentiles, who think that by using many words they will obtain a hearing.
040	MAT	006	008	Do not imitate them; for God, your Father, knows what you need before you ask him.
040	MAT	006	009	You, therefore, should pray like this – “Our Father, who is in heaven, may your name be held holy,
040	MAT	006	010	your kingdom come, your will be done – on earth, as in heaven.
040	MAT	006	011	Give us today the bread that we will need;
040	MAT	006	012	and forgive us our wrongdoings, as we have forgiven those who have wronged us;
040	MAT	006	013	and take us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.”
040	MAT	006	014	For, if you forgive others their offences, your heavenly Father will forgive you also;
040	MAT	006	015	but, if you do not forgive others their offences, not even your Father will forgive your offences.
040	MAT	006	016	‘And, when you fast, do not put on gloomy looks, as hypocrites do who disfigure their faces so that they may be seen by people to be fasting. That, I tell you, is their reward!
040	MAT	006	017	But, when one of you fasts, they should anoint their head and wash their face,
040	MAT	006	018	so that they may not be seen by people to be fasting, but by their Father who dwells in secret; and their Father, who sees what is secret, will reward them.
040	MAT	006	019	‘Do not store up treasures for yourselves on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.
040	MAT	006	020	But store up treasures for yourselves in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in or steal.
040	MAT	006	021	For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
040	MAT	006	022	The lamp of the body is the eye. If your eye is unclouded, your whole body will be lit up;
040	MAT	006	023	but, if your eye is diseased, your whole body will be darkened. And, if the inner light is darkness, how intense must that darkness be!
040	MAT	006	024	No one can serve two masters, for either they will hate one and love the other, or else they will attach themselves to one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and Money.
040	MAT	006	025	‘This is why I say to you, Do not be anxious about your life – what you can get to eat or drink, or about your body – what you can get to wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?
040	MAT	006	026	Look at the wild birds – they neither sow, nor reap, nor gather into barns; and yet your heavenly Father feeds them! Aren’t you more precious than they?
040	MAT	006	027	But which of you, by being anxious, can prolong their life a single moment?
040	MAT	006	028	And why be anxious about clothing? Study the wild lilies, and how they grow. They neither toil nor spin;
040	MAT	006	029	yet I tell you that even Solomon in all his splendour was not robed like one of these.
040	MAT	006	030	If God so clothes even the grass of the field, which is living today and tomorrow will be thrown into the oven, won’t he much more clothe you, you of little faith?
040	MAT	006	031	Do not then ask anxiously “What can we get to eat?” or “What can we get to drink?” or “What can we get to wear?”
040	MAT	006	032	All these are the things for which the nations are seeking, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all.
040	MAT	006	033	But first seek his kingdom and the righteousness that he requires, and then all these things will be added for you.
040	MAT	006	034	Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will bring its own anxieties. Every day has trouble enough of its own.
040	MAT	007	001	‘Do not judge and you will not be judged.
040	MAT	007	002	For, just as you judge others, you will yourselves be judged, and the standard that you use will be used for you.
040	MAT	007	003	Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your friend’s eye, while you pay no attention at all to the plank of wood in yours?
040	MAT	007	004	How will you say to your friend “Let me take out the speck from your eye,” when all the time there is a plank in your own?
040	MAT	007	005	Hypocrite! Take out the plank from your own eye first, and then you will see clearly how to take out the speck from your friend’s.
040	MAT	007	006	‘Do not give what is sacred to dogs; they will turn and maul you. Do not throw your pearls before pigs; they will trample them underfoot.
040	MAT	007	007	Ask, and it will be given to you; search, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened to you.
040	MAT	007	008	For the person who asks receives, the person who searches finds, and the door will be opened to the person who knocks.
040	MAT	007	009	Who among you, when their child asks them for bread, will give them a stone,
040	MAT	007	010	or when they ask for a fish, will give them a snake?
040	MAT	007	011	If you, then, wicked though you are, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give what is good to those who ask him!
040	MAT	007	012	‘Do to others whatever you would wish them to do to you; for that is the teaching of both the Law and the prophets.
040	MAT	007	013	Go in by the small gate. The road that leads to destruction is broad and spacious, and many go in by it.
040	MAT	007	014	For the gate is small, and the road narrow, that leads to life, and there are few who find it.
040	MAT	007	015	‘Beware of false teachers – people who come to you in the guise of sheep, but at heart they are ravenous wolves.
040	MAT	007	016	By the fruit of their lives you will know them. Do people pick grapes from thorn bushes, or figs from thistles?
040	MAT	007	017	So, too, every sound tree bears good fruit, while a worthless tree bears bad fruit.
040	MAT	007	018	A sound tree cannot produce bad fruit, nor can a worthless tree bear good fruit.
040	MAT	007	019	Every tree that fails to bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
040	MAT	007	020	So it is by the fruit of their lives that you will know such people.
040	MAT	007	021	Not everyone who says to me “Master! Master!” will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.
040	MAT	007	022	On that day many will say to me “Master, Master, was not it in your name that we taught, and in your name that we drove out demons, and in your name that we did many miracles?”
040	MAT	007	023	And then I will say to them plainly “I never knew you. Go from my presence, you who live in sin.”
040	MAT	007	024	‘Everyone, therefore, who listens to this teaching of mine and acts on it may be compared to a prudent person, who built their house on the rock.
040	MAT	007	025	The rain poured down, the rivers rose, the winds blew and beat on that house, but it did not fall, for its foundations were on the rock.
040	MAT	007	026	Everyone who listens to this teaching of mine and does not act on it may be compared to a foolish person, who built their house on the sand.
040	MAT	007	027	The rain poured down, the rivers rose, the winds blew and struck against that house, and it fell with a great crash.’
040	MAT	007	028	By the time that Jesus had finished speaking, the crowd was filled with amazement at his teaching.
040	MAT	007	029	For he taught them like one who had authority, and not like their teachers of the Law.
040	MAT	008	001	When Jesus had come down from the hill, great crowds followed him.
040	MAT	008	002	He saw a leper who came up, and bowed to the ground before him, and said, ‘Master, if only you are willing, you are able to make me clean.’
040	MAT	008	003	Stretching out his hand, Jesus touched him, saying as he did so, ‘I am willing; become clean.’ Instantly he was made clean from his leprosy;
040	MAT	008	004	and then Jesus said to him, ‘Be careful not to say a word to anyone, but go and show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift directed by Moses, as evidence of your cure.’
040	MAT	008	005	After Jesus had entered Capernaum, a centurion in the Roman army came up to him, entreating his help.
040	MAT	008	006	‘Sir,’ he said, ‘my manservant is lying ill at my house with a stroke of paralysis, and is suffering terribly.’
040	MAT	008	007	‘I will come and cure him,’ answered Jesus.
040	MAT	008	008	‘Sir,’ the centurion went on, ‘I am unworthy to receive you under my roof; but only speak, and my manservant will be cured.
040	MAT	008	009	For I myself am a man under the orders of others, with soldiers under me; and, if I say to one of them “Go,” he goes, and to another “Come,” he comes, and to my slave “Do this,” he does it.’
040	MAT	008	010	Jesus was surprised to hear this, and said to those who were following him, ‘Never I tell you, in any Israelite have I met with such faith as this!
040	MAT	008	011	Yes, and many will come in from East and West and take their places beside Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven;
040	MAT	008	012	while the heirs to the kingdom will be banished into the darkness outside; there, there will be weeping and grinding of teeth.’
040	MAT	008	013	Then Jesus said to the centurion, ‘Go now, and it will be according to your faith.’ And the man was cured that very hour.
040	MAT	008	014	When Jesus went into Peter’s house, he saw Peter’s mother-in-law prostrated with fever.
040	MAT	008	015	On his taking her hand, the fever left her, and she rose and began to take care of him.
040	MAT	008	016	In the evening the people brought to Jesus many who were possessed by demons; and he drove out the spirits with a word, and cured all who were ill,
040	MAT	008	017	in fulfilment of these words in the prophet Isaiah – “He took our infirmities on himself, and bore the burden of our diseases.”
040	MAT	008	018	Seeing a crowd round him, Jesus gave orders to go across.
040	MAT	008	019	A teacher of the Law came up to him, and said, ‘Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.’
040	MAT	008	020	‘Foxes have holes,’ answered Jesus, ‘and wild birds their nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.’
040	MAT	008	021	‘Master,’ said another, who was a disciple, ‘let me first go and bury my father.’
040	MAT	008	022	But Jesus answered, ‘Follow me, and leave the dead to bury their dead.’
040	MAT	008	023	Then he got into the boat, followed by his disciples.
040	MAT	008	024	Suddenly so great a storm came up on the sea, that the waves broke right over the boat. But Jesus was asleep;
040	MAT	008	025	and the disciples came and roused him. ‘Master,’ they cried, ‘save us; we are lost!’
040	MAT	008	026	‘Why are you so timid?’ he said. ‘You of little faith!’ Then Jesus rose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and a great calm followed.
040	MAT	008	027	The men were amazed, and exclaimed, ‘What kind of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him!’
040	MAT	008	028	On getting to the other side – the region of the Gadarenes – Jesus met two men who were possessed by demons, coming out of the tombs. They were so violent that no one was able to pass that way.
040	MAT	008	029	Suddenly they shrieked out, ‘What do you want with us, Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before our time?’
040	MAT	008	030	A long way off, there was a herd of many pigs, feeding;
040	MAT	008	031	and the foul spirits began begging Jesus, ‘If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs.’
040	MAT	008	032	‘Go,’ he said. The spirits came out, and entered the pigs; and the whole herd rushed down the steep slope into the sea, and died in the water.
040	MAT	008	033	At this the men who tended them ran away and went to the town, carrying the news of all that had occurred, and of what had happened to the possessed men.
040	MAT	008	034	At the news the whole town went out to meet Jesus, and, when they saw him, they entreated him to go away from their region.
040	MAT	009	001	Afterwards Jesus got into a boat, and, crossing over, came to his own city.
040	MAT	009	002	There some people brought to him a paralysed man on a bed. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the man, ‘Courage, child! Your sins are forgiven.’
040	MAT	009	003	Then some of the teachers of the Law said to themselves, ‘This man is blaspheming!’
040	MAT	009	004	Knowing their thoughts, Jesus exclaimed, ‘Why do you cherish such wicked thoughts?
040	MAT	009	005	Which, I ask, is the easier? – to say “Your sins are forgiven”? Or to say “Get up, and walk”?
040	MAT	009	006	But to show you that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins’ – then he said to the paralysed man – ‘Get up, take up your bed, and return to your home.’
040	MAT	009	007	The man got up and went to his home.
040	MAT	009	008	When the crowd saw this, they were awe-struck, and praised God for giving such power to human beings.
040	MAT	009	009	As Jesus went along, he saw a man, called Matthew, sitting in the tax office, and said to him, ‘Follow me.’ Matthew got up and followed him.
040	MAT	009	010	And, later on, when he was having dinner in the house, a number of tax collectors and outcasts came in and took their places at the table with Jesus and his disciples.
040	MAT	009	011	When the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, ‘Why does your teacher eat in the company of tax collectors and outcasts?’
040	MAT	009	012	On hearing this, Jesus said, ‘It is not those who are healthy who need a doctor, but those who are ill.
040	MAT	009	013	Go and learn what this means – “I desire mercy, and not sacrifice”; for I did not come to call the religious, but the outcast.’
040	MAT	009	014	Then John’s disciples came to Jesus, and asked, ‘Why do we and the Pharisees fast while your disciples do not?’
040	MAT	009	015	Jesus answered, ‘Can the groom’s friends mourn as long as the groom is with them? But the days will come, when the groom will be taken away from them, and they will fast then.
040	MAT	009	016	Nobody ever puts a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; for such a patch tears away from the garment, and a worse tear is made.
040	MAT	009	017	Nor do people put new wine into old wine-skins; for, if they do, the skins burst, and the wine runs out, and the skins are lost; but they put new wine into fresh skins, and so both are preserved.’
040	MAT	009	018	While Jesus was saying this, a synagogue leader came up and bowed to the ground before him. ‘My daughter,’ he said, ‘has just died; but come and place your hand on her, and she will be restored to life.’
040	MAT	009	019	So Jesus rose and followed him, and his disciples went also.
040	MAT	009	020	But meanwhile a woman, who had been suffering from haemorrhage for twelve years, came up behind and touched the tassel of his cloak.
040	MAT	009	021	‘If I only touch his cloak,’ she said to herself, ‘I will get well.’
040	MAT	009	022	Turning and seeing her, Jesus said, ‘Courage, daughter! Your faith has delivered you.’ And at that very moment she became well.
040	MAT	009	023	When Jesus reached the leader’s house, seeing the flute players, and a number of people all in confusion,
040	MAT	009	024	he said, ‘Go away, the little girl is not dead; she is asleep.’ They began to laugh at him;
040	MAT	009	025	but, when the people had been sent out, Jesus went in, and took the little girl’s hand, and she rose.
040	MAT	009	026	The report of this spread through all that part of the country.
040	MAT	009	027	As Jesus was passing on from there, he was followed by two blind men, who kept calling out, ‘Take pity on us, Son of David!’
040	MAT	009	028	When he had gone indoors, the blind men came up to him; and Jesus asked them, ‘Do you believe that I am able to do this?’ ‘Yes, Master!’ they answered.
040	MAT	009	029	Then he touched their eyes, and said, ‘It will be according to your faith.’
040	MAT	009	030	Then their eyes were opened. Jesus sternly cautioned them. ‘See that no one knows of it,’ he said.
040	MAT	009	031	But the men went out, and spread the news about him through all that part of the country.
040	MAT	009	032	Just as they were going out, some people brought up to Jesus a dumb man who was possessed by a demon;
040	MAT	009	033	and, as soon as the demon had been driven out, the dumb man spoke. The people were astonished at this, and exclaimed, ‘Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel!’
040	MAT	009	034	But the Pharisees said, ‘He drives out the demons by the help of the chief of the demons.’
040	MAT	009	035	Jesus went round all the towns and the villages, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, and curing every kind of disease and every kind of sickness.
040	MAT	009	036	But, when he saw the crowds, his heart was moved with compassion for them, because they were distressed and harassed, like sheep without a shepherd;
040	MAT	009	037	and he said to his disciples, ‘The harvest is abundant, but the labourers are few.
040	MAT	009	038	Therefore pray to the owner of the harvest to send labourers to gather in his harvest.’
040	MAT	010	001	Calling his twelve Disciples to him, Jesus gave them authority over foul spirits, so that they could drive them out, as well as the power of curing every kind of disease and every kind of sickness.
040	MAT	010	002	The names of the twelve apostles are these, First Simon, also known as Peter, and his brother Andrew; James the son of Zebedee, and his brother John;
040	MAT	010	003	Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax-gatherer; James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus;
040	MAT	010	004	Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot – the apostle who betrayed him.
040	MAT	010	005	These twelve Jesus sent out as his messengers, after giving them these instructions – ‘Do not go to the Gentiles, nor enter any Samaritan town,
040	MAT	010	006	but make your way rather to the lost sheep of Israel.
040	MAT	010	007	On your way proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
040	MAT	010	008	Cure the sick, raise the dead, make the lepers clean, drive out demons. You have received free of cost, give free of cost.
040	MAT	010	009	Do not provide yourselves with gold, or silver, or coins in your purses;
040	MAT	010	010	not even with a bag for the journey, or a change of clothes, or sandals, or even a staff; for the worker is worth his food.
040	MAT	010	011	Whatever town or village you visit, find out who is worthy in that place, and remain there until you leave.
040	MAT	010	012	As you enter the house, greet it.
040	MAT	010	013	Then, if the house is worthy, let your blessing rest on it, but, if it is unworthy, let your blessing return on yourselves.
040	MAT	010	014	If no one welcomes you, or listens to what you say, as you leave that house or that town, shake off its dust from your feet.
040	MAT	010	015	I tell you, the doom of the land of Sodom and Gomorrah will be more bearable in the day of judgment than the doom of that town.
040	MAT	010	016	‘Remember, I am sending you out as my messengers like sheep among wolves. So be as wise as snakes, and as blameless as doves.
040	MAT	010	017	Be on your guard against others, for they will betray you to courts of law, and scourge you in their synagogues;
040	MAT	010	018	and you will be brought before governors and kings for my sake so that you may witness for me before them and the nations.
040	MAT	010	019	Whenever they betray you, do not be anxious as to how you will speak or what you will say, for what you will say will be given you at the moment;
040	MAT	010	020	for it will not be you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father that speaks within you.
040	MAT	010	021	Brother will betray brother to death, and the father his child; and children will turn against their parents, and cause them to be put to death;
040	MAT	010	022	and you will be hated by everyone because of me. Yet the person who endures to the end will be saved.
040	MAT	010	023	But, when they persecute you in one town, escape to the next; for, I tell you, you will not have come to the end of the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes.
040	MAT	010	024	A student is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his master.
040	MAT	010	025	It is enough for a student to be treated like his teacher, and a servant like his master. If the head of the house has been called Beelzebul, how much more the members of his household!
040	MAT	010	026	Do not, therefore, be afraid of them. There is nothing concealed which will not be revealed, nor anything hidden which will not become known.
040	MAT	010	027	What I tell you in the dark, say again in the light; and what is whispered in your ear, proclaim on the housetops.
040	MAT	010	028	Do not be afraid of those who kill the body, but are unable to kill the soul; rather be afraid of him who is able to destroy both soul and body in Gehenna.
040	MAT	010	029	Are not two sparrows sold for a one copper coin? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground without your Father’s knowledge.
040	MAT	010	030	While as for you, even the hairs of your head are numbered.
040	MAT	010	031	Do not, therefore, be afraid; you are of more value than many sparrows.
040	MAT	010	032	Everyone, therefore, who will publicly acknowledge me, I, too, will acknowledge before my Father who is in heaven;
040	MAT	010	033	but, if anyone publicly disowns me, I, too, will disown him before my Father who is in heaven.
040	MAT	010	034	‘Do not imagine that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have come to bring, not peace, but the sword.
040	MAT	010	035	For I have come to set a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.
040	MAT	010	036	A person’s enemies will be the members of their own household.
040	MAT	010	037	Anyone who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and anyone who loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.
040	MAT	010	038	Anyone who does not take their cross and follow in my steps is not worthy of me.
040	MAT	010	039	The person who has found their life will lose it, while the person who, for my sake, has lost their life will find it.
040	MAT	010	040	‘Anyone who welcomes you is welcoming me; and anyone who welcomes me is welcoming him who sent me as his messenger.
040	MAT	010	041	The person who welcomes a prophet, because they are a prophet, will receive a prophet’s reward; and anyone who welcomes a good person, because they are a good person, will receive a good person’s reward.
040	MAT	010	042	And, if anyone gives but a cup of cold water to one of these little ones because they are a disciple, I tell you that they will assuredly not lose their reward.’
040	MAT	011	001	After Jesus had finished giving directions to his twelve Disciples, he left that place in order to teach and preach in their towns.
040	MAT	011	002	Now John had heard in prison what the Christ was doing, and he sent a message by his disciples,
040	MAT	011	003	and asked – ‘Are you “the coming one,” or are we to look for someone else?’
040	MAT	011	004	The answer of Jesus to the question was – ‘Go and report to John what you hear and see –
040	MAT	011	005	the blind recover their sight and the lame walk, the lepers are made clean and the deaf hear, the dead, too, are raised to life, and the good news is told to the poor.
040	MAT	011	006	Blessed is the person who finds no hindrance in me.’
040	MAT	011	007	While John’s disciples were going back, Jesus began to say to the crowds with reference to John,
040	MAT	011	008	‘What did you go out into the wilderness to look at? A reed waving in the wind? If not, what did you go out to see? A man richly dressed? Why, those who wear rich things are to be found in the courts of kings!
040	MAT	011	009	What, then, did you go for? To see a prophet? Yes, I tell you, and far more than a prophet.
040	MAT	011	010	This is the man of whom scripture says – “I am sending my messenger ahead of you, and he will prepare your way before you.”
040	MAT	011	011	I tell you, no one born of a woman has yet appeared who is greater than John the Baptist; and yet the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
040	MAT	011	012	From the time of John the Baptist to this very hour, the kingdom of heaven has been taken by force, and people using force have been seizing it.
040	MAT	011	013	For the teaching of all the prophets and of the Law continued until the time of John;
040	MAT	011	014	and – if you are ready to accept it – John is himself the Elijah who was destined to come.
040	MAT	011	015	If you have ears, listen.
040	MAT	011	016	But to what will I compare the present generation? It is like little children sitting in the market-places and calling out to their playmates –
040	MAT	011	017	We have played the flute for you, but you have not danced; We have wailed, but you have not mourned.
040	MAT	011	018	For, when John came, neither eating nor drinking, people said “He has a demon in him”;
040	MAT	011	019	and now that the Son of Man has come, eating and drinking, they are saying “Here is a glutton and a wine-drinker, a friend of tax collectors and outcasts!” And yet wisdom is vindicated by her actions.’
040	MAT	011	020	Then Jesus began to reproach the towns in which most of his miracles had been done, because they had not repented,
040	MAT	011	021	‘Alas for you, Chorazin! Alas for you, Bethsaida! For, if the miracles which were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
040	MAT	011	022	Yet, I tell you, the doom of Tyre and Sidon will be more bearable in the day of judgment than yours.
040	MAT	011	023	And you, Capernaum! Will you exalt yourself to heaven? You will be flung down to Hades! For, if the miracles which have been done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have been standing to this day.
040	MAT	011	024	Yet, I tell you, the doom of Sodom will be more bearable in the day of judgment than yours.’
040	MAT	011	025	At that same time Jesus uttered the words, ‘I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that, though you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, you have revealed them to the childlike!
040	MAT	011	026	Yes, Father, I thank you that this has seemed good to you.
040	MAT	011	027	Everything has been committed to me by my Father; nor does anyone fully know the Son, except the Father, or fully know the Father, except the Son and those to whom the Son may choose to reveal him.
040	MAT	011	028	Come to me, all you who toil and are burdened, and I will give you rest!
040	MAT	011	029	Take my yoke on you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble, and you will find rest for your souls;
040	MAT	011	030	for my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.’
040	MAT	012	001	About the same time Jesus walked through the cornfields one Sabbath. His disciples were hungry, and began to pick some ears of wheat and eat them.
040	MAT	012	002	But, when the Pharisees saw this, they said, ‘Look! Your disciples are doing what it is not allowable to do on a Sabbath!’
040	MAT	012	003	‘Haven’t you read,’ replied Jesus, ‘what David did, when he and his companions were hungry –
040	MAT	012	004	how he went into the house of God, and how they ate the consecrated bread, though it was not allowable for him or his companions to eat it, but only for the priests?
040	MAT	012	005	And haven’t you read in the law that, on the Sabbath, the priest in the Temple break the Sabbath and yet are not guilty?
040	MAT	012	006	Here, however, I tell you, there is something greater than the Temple!
040	MAT	012	007	Had you learned the meaning of the words – “I desire mercy, and not sacrifice,” you would not have condemned those who are not guilty.
040	MAT	012	008	For the Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath.’
040	MAT	012	009	Passing on, Jesus went into their synagogue,
040	MAT	012	010	and there he saw a man with a withered hand. Some people asked Jesus whether it was allowable to work a cure on the Sabbath – so that they might have a charge to bring against him.
040	MAT	012	011	But Jesus said to them, ‘Which of you, if he had only one sheep, and that sheep fell into a pit on the Sabbath, would not lay hold of it and pull it out?
040	MAT	012	012	How much more precious a person is than a sheep! Therefore it is allowable to do good on the Sabbath.’
040	MAT	012	013	Then he said to the man. ‘Stretch out your hand.’ The man stretched it out; and it had become as sound as the other.
040	MAT	012	014	On coming out, the Pharisees plotted against Jesus, to put him to death.
040	MAT	012	015	Jesus, however, became aware of it, and went away from that place. A number of people followed him, and he cured them all;
040	MAT	012	016	but he warned them not to make him known,
040	MAT	012	017	in fulfilment of these words in the prophet Isaiah –
040	MAT	012	018	“Here is my chosen servant, who I love and who pleases me! I will breathe my spirit on him, and he will announce a time of judgment to the Gentiles.
040	MAT	012	019	He will not contend, nor cry aloud, Neither will anyone hear his voice in the streets;
040	MAT	012	020	a bruised reed he will not break, and a smouldering wick he will not quench, until he has brought the judgment to a victorious issue,
040	MAT	012	021	and on his name will the Gentiles rest their hopes.”
040	MAT	012	022	Then some people brought to Jesus a possessed man, who was blind and dumb; and he cured him, so that the man who had been dumb both talked and saw.
040	MAT	012	023	At this all the people were astounded. ‘Is it possible that this is the son of David?’ they exclaimed.
040	MAT	012	024	But the Pharisees heard of it and said, ‘He drives out demons only by the help of Beelzebul the chief of the demons.’
040	MAT	012	025	Jesus, however, was aware of what was passing in their minds, and said to them, ‘Any kingdom divided against itself becomes a desolation, and any town or household divided against itself will not last.
040	MAT	012	026	So, if Satan drives Satan out, he must be divided against himself; and how, then, can his kingdom last?
040	MAT	012	027	And, if it is by Beelzebul’s help that I drive out demons, by whose help is it that your own sons drive them out? Therefore they will themselves be your judges.
040	MAT	012	028	But, if it is by the help of the Spirit of God that I drive out demons, then the kingdom of God must already be upon you.
040	MAT	012	029	How, again, can anyone get into a strong man’s house and carry off his goods, without first securing him? Not until then will he plunder his house.
040	MAT	012	030	Anyone who is not with me is against me, and the person who does not help me to gather is scattering.
040	MAT	012	031	Therefore, I tell you, people will be forgiven every sin and slander; but slander against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
040	MAT	012	032	Whoever speaks against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in the present age, or in the age to come.
040	MAT	012	033	‘You must assume either that both tree and fruit are good, or that both tree and fruit are worthless; since it is by its fruits that a tree is known.
040	MAT	012	034	You children of snakes! How can you, evil as you are, say anything good? For what fills the heart will rise to the lips.
040	MAT	012	035	A good person, from his good stores, produces good things; while an evil person, from his evil stores, produces evil things.
040	MAT	012	036	I tell you that for every careless thing that people say, they must answer on the “day of judgment.”
040	MAT	012	037	For it is by your words that you will be acquitted, and by your words that you will be condemned.’
040	MAT	012	038	At this point, some teachers of the Law and Pharisees spoke up. ‘Teacher,’ they said, ‘we want to see some sign from you.’
040	MAT	012	039	‘It is a wicked and unfaithful generation,’ answered Jesus, ‘that is asking for a sign, and no sign will be given it except the sign of the prophet Jonah.
040	MAT	012	040	For, just as Jonah was inside the sea-monster three days and three nights, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
040	MAT	012	041	At the judgment, the people of Nineveh will stand up with this generation, and will condemn it, because they repented at Jonah’s proclamation; and here is more than a Jonah!
040	MAT	012	042	At the judgment the Queen of the South will rise up with the present generation, and will condemn it, because she came from the ends of the earth to listen to the wisdom of Solomon; and here is more than a Solomon!
040	MAT	012	043	No sooner does a foul spirit leave a person, than it passes through places where there is no water, in search of rest, and does not find it.
040	MAT	012	044	Then it says “I will go back to the home which I left”; but, on coming there, it finds it unoccupied, and swept, and put in order.
040	MAT	012	045	Then it goes and brings with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in, and make their home there; and the last state of that man proves to be worse than the first. So, too, will it be with this wicked generation.’
040	MAT	012	046	While he was still speaking to the crowds, his mother and brothers were standing outside, asking to speak to him.
040	MAT	012	047	Someone told him this, and Jesus replied,
040	MAT	012	048	‘Who is my mother? And who are my brothers?’
040	MAT	012	049	Then, stretching out his hands towards his disciples, he said, ‘Here are my mother and my brothers!
040	MAT	012	050	For anyone who does the will of my Father who is in heaven is my brother and sister and mother.’
040	MAT	013	001	That same day, when Jesus had left the house and was sitting by the sea,
040	MAT	013	002	such great crowds gathered round him, that he got into a boat, and sat in it, while all the people stood on the beach.
040	MAT	013	003	Then he told them many truths in parables. ‘The sower,’ he began, ‘went out to sow; and,
040	MAT	013	004	as they were sowing, some seed fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up.
040	MAT	013	005	Some fell on rocky places, where it had not much soil, and, because the soil wasn’t deep, sprang up at once.
040	MAT	013	006	As soon as the sun had risen, it was scorched, and, because their roots were not deep enough, withered away.
040	MAT	013	007	Some, again, fell into the brambles; but the brambles shot up and choked it.
040	MAT	013	008	Some, however, fell on good soil, and yielded a return, sometimes one hundred, sometimes sixty, sometimes thirty fold.
040	MAT	013	009	Let those who have ears hear.’
040	MAT	013	010	Afterwards his disciples came to him, and said, ‘Why do you speak to them in parables?’
040	MAT	013	011	‘To you,’ answered Jesus, ‘the knowledge of the hidden truths of the kingdom of heaven has been imparted, but not to those.
040	MAT	013	012	For, to all who have, more will be given, and they will have abundance; but, from all who have nothing, even what they have will be taken away.
040	MAT	013	013	That is why I speak to them in parables, because, though they have eyes, they do not see, and though they have ears, they do not hear or understand.
040	MAT	013	014	In them is being fulfilled that prophecy of Isaiah which says – “You will hear with your ears without ever understanding, and, though you have eyes, you will see without ever perceiving,
040	MAT	013	015	for the mind of this nation has grown dense, and their ears are dull of hearing, their eyes also have they closed; otherwise some day they might perceive with their eyes, and with their ears they might hear, and in their mind they might understand, and might turn – and I might heal them.”
040	MAT	013	016	‘But blessed are your eyes, for they see, and your ears, for they hear;
040	MAT	013	017	for I tell you that many prophets and good people have longed for the sight of the things which you are seeing, yet never saw them, and to hear the things which you are hearing, yet never heard them.
040	MAT	013	018	‘Listen, then, yourselves to the parable of the sower.
040	MAT	013	019	When anyone hears the message of the kingdom without understanding it, the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in their mind. This is the person meant by the seed which was sown along the path.
040	MAT	013	020	By the seed which was sown on rocky places is meant the person who hears the message, and at once accepts it joyfully;
040	MAT	013	021	but, as they have no root, they stand for only a short time; and, when trouble or persecution arises because of the message, they fall away at once.
040	MAT	013	022	By the seed which was sown among the brambles is meant the person who hears the message, but the cares of life and the glamour of wealth completely choke the message, so that it gives no return.
040	MAT	013	023	But by the seed which was sown on the good ground is meant the person who hears the message and understands it, and really yields a return, sometimes one hundred, sometimes sixty, sometimes thirty fold.’
040	MAT	013	024	Another parable which Jesus told them was this – ‘The kingdom of heaven is compared to a person who sowed good seed in their field.
040	MAT	013	025	But, while everyone was asleep, their enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and then went away.
040	MAT	013	026	So, when the blades of corn shot up, and came into ear, the weeds made their appearance also.
040	MAT	013	027	The owner’s servants came to them, and said “Was not it good seed that you sowed in your field? Where, then, do the weeds in it come from?”
040	MAT	013	028	“An enemy has done this,” was the owner’s answer. “Do you wish us, then,” they asked, “to go and gather them together?”
040	MAT	013	029	“No,” said he, “because while you are pulling up the weeds you might uproot the wheat with them.
040	MAT	013	030	Let both grow side by side until harvest; and then I will say to the reapers, Gather the weeds together first, and tie them in bundles for burning; but bring all the wheat into my barn.”’
040	MAT	013	031	Another parable which he told them was this – ‘The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a person took and sowed in his field.
040	MAT	013	032	This seed is smaller than all other seeds, but, when it has grown up, it is larger than the herbs and becomes a tree, so that “the wild birds come and roost in its branches.”’
040	MAT	013	033	This was another parable which Jesus related – ‘The kingdom of heaven is like some yeast which a woman took and covered up in three pecks of flour, until the whole had risen.’
040	MAT	013	034	Of all this Jesus spoke to the crowd in parables; indeed to them he used never to speak at all except in parables,
040	MAT	013	035	in fulfilment of these words in the prophet – “I will speak to them in parables; I will utter things kept secret since the foundation of the world.”
040	MAT	013	036	Then Jesus left the crowd, and went into the house. Presently his disciples came to him, and said, ‘Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field.’
040	MAT	013	037	He answered, ‘The sower of the good seed is the Son of Man.
040	MAT	013	038	The field is the world. By the good seed is meant the people of the kingdom. The weeds are the wicked,
040	MAT	013	039	and the enemy who sowed them is the devil. The harvest time is the close of the age, and the reapers are angels.
040	MAT	013	040	And, just as the weeds are gathered and burnt, so it will be at the close of the age.
040	MAT	013	041	The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will gather from his kingdom all that hinders and those who live in sin,
040	MAT	013	042	and will throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth.
040	MAT	013	043	Then will the righteous shine, like the sun, in the kingdom of their Father. If you have ears, listen.
040	MAT	013	044	‘The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field, which a person found and hid again, and then, in their delight, went and sold everything that they had, and bought that field.
040	MAT	013	045	‘Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of choice pearls.
040	MAT	013	046	Finding one of great value, they went and sold everything that they had, and bought it.
040	MAT	013	047	Or again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net which was cast into the sea, and caught fish of all kinds.
040	MAT	013	048	When it was full, they hauled it up on the beach, and sat down and sorted the good fish into baskets, but threw the worthless ones away.
040	MAT	013	049	So will it be at the close of the age. The angels will go out and separate the wicked from the righteous,
040	MAT	013	050	and will throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth.
040	MAT	013	051	‘Have you understood all this?’ Jesus asked. ‘Yes,’ they answered.
040	MAT	013	052	Then he added, ‘So every teacher of the Law, who has received instruction about the kingdom of heaven, is like a householder who produces from his stores things both new and old.’
040	MAT	013	053	When Jesus had finished these parables, he withdrew from that place.
040	MAT	013	054	Going to his own part of the country, he taught the people in their synagogue in such a manner that they were deeply impressed. ‘Where did he get this wisdom?’ they said, ‘and the miracles?
040	MAT	013	055	Isn’t he the carpenter’s son? Isn’t his mother called Mary, and his brothers James, and Joseph, and Simon, and Judas?
040	MAT	013	056	And his sisters, too – are not they all living among us? Where, then did he get all this?’
040	MAT	013	057	These things proved a hindrance to their believing in him. But Jesus said, ‘A prophet is not without honour, except in his own country and in his own house.’
040	MAT	013	058	He did not work many miracles there, because of their want of faith.
040	MAT	014	001	At that time Prince Herod heard of the fame of Jesus,
040	MAT	014	002	and said to his attendants, ‘This must be John the Baptist; he must be risen from the dead, and that is why these miraculous powers are active in him.’
040	MAT	014	003	For Herod had arrested John, put him in chains, and shut him up in prison, to please Herodias, the wife of Herod’s brother Philip.
040	MAT	014	004	For John had said to him “You have no right to be living with her.”
040	MAT	014	005	Yet, though Herod wanted to put him to death, he was afraid of the people, because they looked on John as a prophet.
040	MAT	014	006	But, when Herod’s birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced before his guests, and so pleased Herod,
040	MAT	014	007	that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked.
040	MAT	014	008	Prompted by her mother, the girl said “Give me here, on a dish, the head of John the Baptist.”
040	MAT	014	009	The king was distressed at this; yet, because of his oath and of the guests at his table, he ordered it to be given her.
040	MAT	014	010	He had John beheaded in the prison
040	MAT	014	011	and his head was brought on a dish and given to the girl, and she took it to her mother.
040	MAT	014	012	Then John’s disciples came, and took the body away, and buried it; and went and told Jesus.
040	MAT	014	013	When Jesus heard of it, he left privately in a boat to a lonely spot. The people, however, heard of his going, and followed him in crowds from the towns on foot.
040	MAT	014	014	On getting out of the boat, Jesus saw a great crowd, and his heart was moved at the sight of them; and he cured all the sick among them.
040	MAT	014	015	In the evening the disciples came up to him, and said, ‘This is a lonely spot, and the day is now far advanced; send the crowds away so that they can go to the villages, and buy themselves food.’
040	MAT	014	016	But Jesus said, ‘They need not go away, it is for you to give them something to eat.’
040	MAT	014	017	‘We have nothing here,’ they said, ‘except five loaves and two fish.’
040	MAT	014	018	‘Bring them here to me,’ was his reply.
040	MAT	014	019	Jesus ordered the people to take their seats on the grass; and, taking the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven, and said the blessing, and, after he had broken the loaves, gave them to his disciples; and they gave them to the crowds.
040	MAT	014	020	Everyone had sufficient to eat, and they picked up enough of the broken pieces that were left to fill twelve baskets.
040	MAT	014	021	The men who ate were about five thousand in number, without counting women and children.
040	MAT	014	022	Immediately afterwards Jesus made the disciples get into a boat and cross over in advance of him, while he dismissed the crowds.
040	MAT	014	023	After dismissing the crowds, he went up the hill by himself to pray; and, when evening fell, he was there alone.
040	MAT	014	024	The boat was by this time some miles from shore, labouring in the waves, for the wind was against her.
040	MAT	014	025	Three hours after midnight, however, Jesus came towards the disciples, walking on the water.
040	MAT	014	026	But, when they saw him walking on the water, they were terrified. ‘It is a ghost,’ they exclaimed, and cried out in fear.
040	MAT	014	027	But Jesus at once spoke to them. ‘Courage!’ he said, ‘It is I; do not be afraid!’
040	MAT	014	028	‘Master,’ Peter exclaimed, ‘if it is you, tell me to come to you on the water.’
040	MAT	014	029	Jesus said, ‘Come.’ So Peter got down from the boat, and walked on the water, and went towards Jesus;
040	MAT	014	030	but, when he felt the wind, he was frightened, and, beginning to sink, cried out, ‘Master! Save me!’
040	MAT	014	031	Instantly Jesus stretched out his hand, and caught hold of him. ‘You of little faith!’ he said, ‘Why did you falter?’
040	MAT	014	032	When they had got into the boat, the wind dropped.
040	MAT	014	033	But the men in the boat threw themselves on their faces before him, and said, ‘You are indeed God’s Son.’
040	MAT	014	034	When they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret.
040	MAT	014	035	But the people of that place, recognising Jesus, sent out to the whole country round, and brought to him all who were ill,
040	MAT	014	036	begging him merely to let them touch the tassel of his cloak; and all who touched were made perfectly well.
040	MAT	015	001	Then some Pharisees and teachers of the Law came to Jesus, and said,
040	MAT	015	002	‘How is it that your disciples break the traditions of our ancestors? For they do not wash their hands when they eat food.’
040	MAT	015	003	His reply was, ‘How is it that you on your side break God’s commandments out of respect for your own traditions?
040	MAT	015	004	For God said – “Honour your father and mother,” and “Anyone who abuses his father or mother must suffer death,”
040	MAT	015	005	but you say “Whenever anyone says to his father or mother ‘Whatever of mine might have been of service to you is set apart for God,’
040	MAT	015	006	he is in no way bound to honour his father.” In this way you have nullified the words of God for the sake of your traditions.
040	MAT	015	007	Hypocrites! It was well said by Isaiah when he prophesied about you –
040	MAT	015	008	“This is a people that honour me with their lips, While their hearts are far removed from me;
040	MAT	015	009	but vainly do they worship me, For they teach but human precepts.”’
040	MAT	015	010	Then Jesus called the people to him, and said, ‘Listen, and mark my words.
040	MAT	015	011	It is not what enters a person’s mouth that defiles them, but what comes out from their mouth – that does defile them!’
040	MAT	015	012	His disciples came up to him, and said, ‘Do you know that the Pharisees were shocked on hearing what you said?’
040	MAT	015	013	‘Every plant,’ Jesus replied, ‘that my heavenly Father has not planted will be rooted up.
040	MAT	015	014	Leave them be; they are but blind guides; and, if one blind person guides another, both of them will fall into a ditch.’
040	MAT	015	015	Peter spoke up, ‘Explain this saying to us.’
040	MAT	015	016	‘What, do even you understand nothing yet?’ Jesus exclaimed.
040	MAT	015	017	‘Don’t you see that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the stomach, and is afterwards expelled?
040	MAT	015	018	But the things that come out of the mouth proceed from the heart, and it is these that defile a person;
040	MAT	015	019	for out of the heart proceed evil thoughts – murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, perjury, slander.
040	MAT	015	020	These are the things that defile a person; but eating with unwashed hands does not defile a person.’
040	MAT	015	021	On going away from that place, Jesus went to the country round Tyre and Sidon.
040	MAT	015	022	There, a Canaanite woman of that district came out and began calling to Jesus, ‘Take pity on me, Master, Son of David; my daughter is grievously possessed by a demon.’
040	MAT	015	023	But Jesus did not answer her a word; and his disciples came up and begged him to send her away. ‘She keeps calling out after us,’ they said.
040	MAT	015	024	‘I was not sent,’ replied Jesus, ‘to anyone except the lost sheep of Israel.’
040	MAT	015	025	But the woman came, and, bowing to the ground before him, said, ‘Master, help me.’
040	MAT	015	026	‘It is not fair,’ replied Jesus, ‘to take the children’s food and throw it to dogs.’
040	MAT	015	027	‘Yes, Master,’ she said, ‘for even dogs do feed on the scraps that fall from their owners’ table.’
040	MAT	015	028	‘Your faith is great,’ was his reply to the woman, ‘it will be as you wish!’ And her daughter was cured that very hour.
040	MAT	015	029	On leaving that place, Jesus went to the shore of the Sea of Galilee; and then went up the hill, and sat down.
040	MAT	015	030	Great crowds of people came to him, bringing with them those who were lame, crippled, blind, or dumb, and many others. They put them down at his feet, and he cured them;
040	MAT	015	031	and the crowds were astonished, when they saw the dumb talking, the cripples made sound, the lame walking about, and the blind with their sight restored; and they praised the God of Israel.
040	MAT	015	032	Afterwards Jesus called his disciples to him, and said, ‘My heart is moved at the sight of all these people, for they have already been with me three days and they have nothing to eat; and I am unwilling to send them away hungry; they might faint on the way home.’
040	MAT	015	033	‘Where can we,’ his disciples asked, ‘in a lonely place find enough bread for such a crowd as this?’
040	MAT	015	034	‘How many loaves have you?’ said Jesus. ‘Seven,’ they answered, ‘and a few small fish.’
040	MAT	015	035	Telling the crowd to sit down on the ground,
040	MAT	015	036	Jesus took the seven loaves and the fish, and, after saying the thanksgiving, broke them, and gave them to the disciples; and the disciples gave them to the crowds.
040	MAT	015	037	Everyone had sufficient to eat, and they picked up seven baskets full of the broken pieces left.
040	MAT	015	038	The men who ate were four thousand in number without counting women and children.
040	MAT	015	039	Then, after dismissing the crowds, Jesus got into the boat, and went to the region of Magadan.
040	MAT	016	001	Here the Pharisees and Sadducees came up, and, to test Jesus, requested him to show them some sign from the heavens.
040	MAT	016	002	But Jesus answered, ‘In the evening you say “It will be fine weather, for the sky is as red as fire.”
040	MAT	016	003	But in the morning you say “Today it will be stormy, for the sky is as red as fire and threatening.” You learn to read the sky; yet you are unable to read the signs of the times!
040	MAT	016	004	A wicked and unfaithful generation is asking for a sign, but no sign will be given it except the sign of Jonah.’ So he left them and went away.
040	MAT	016	005	Now the disciples had crossed to the opposite shore, and had forgotten to take any bread.
040	MAT	016	006	Presently Jesus said to them, ‘Take care and be on your guard against the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.’
040	MAT	016	007	But the disciples began talking among themselves about their having brought no bread.
040	MAT	016	008	On noticing this, Jesus said, ‘Why are you talking among yourselves about your being short of bread, you of little faith?
040	MAT	016	009	Don’t you yet see, nor remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you took away?
040	MAT	016	010	Nor yet the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many basketfuls you took away?
040	MAT	016	011	How is it that you do not see that I was not speaking about bread? Be on your guard against the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.’
040	MAT	016	012	Then they understood that he had told them to be on their guard, not against the leaven of bread, but against the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
040	MAT	016	013	On coming into the region of Caesarea Philippi, Jesus asked his disciples this question – ‘Who do people say that the Son of Man is?’
040	MAT	016	014	‘Some say John the Baptist,’ they answered, ‘Others, however, say that he is Elijah, while others again say Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.’
040	MAT	016	015	‘But you,’ he said, ‘who do you say that I am?’
040	MAT	016	016	To this Simon Peter answered, ‘You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.’
040	MAT	016	017	‘Blessed are you, Simon, Son of Jonah,’ Jesus replied. ‘For no human being has revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven.
040	MAT	016	018	Yes, and I say to you, your name is “Peter” – a Rock, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not prevail over it.
040	MAT	016	019	I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you forbid on earth will be held in heaven to be forbidden, and whatever you allow on earth will be held in heaven to be allowed.’
040	MAT	016	020	Then he charged his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Christ.
040	MAT	016	021	At that time Jesus Christ began to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem, and undergo much suffering at the hands of the elders, and chief priests, and teachers of the Law, and be put to death, and rise on the third day.
040	MAT	016	022	But Peter took Jesus aside, and began to rebuke him. ‘Master,’ he said, ‘please God that will never be your fate!’
040	MAT	016	023	Jesus, however, turning to Peter, said, ‘Out of my way, Satan! You are a hindrance to me; for you look at things, not as God does, but as a person does.’
040	MAT	016	024	Then Jesus said to his disciples, ‘If anyone wishes to walk in my steps, they must renounce self, and take up their cross, and follow me.
040	MAT	016	025	For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it, and whoever, for my sake, loses his life will find it.
040	MAT	016	026	What good will it do a person to gain the whole world, if he forfeits his life? Or what will a person give that is of equal value with his life?
040	MAT	016	027	For the Son of Man is to come in his Father’s glory, with his angels, and then he will give to everyone what his actions deserve.
040	MAT	016	028	I tell you, some of those who are standing here will not know death until they have seen the Son of Man coming into his kingdom.’
040	MAT	017	001	Six days later, Jesus took with him Peter, and the brothers James and John, and led them up a high mountain alone.
040	MAT	017	002	There his appearance was transformed before their eyes; his face shone like the sun, and his clothes became as white as the light.
040	MAT	017	003	All at once Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with Jesus.
040	MAT	017	004	‘Master,’ exclaimed Peter, interposing, ‘it is good to be here; if you wish, I will make three tents here, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.’
040	MAT	017	005	While he was still speaking, a bright cloud enveloped them, and there was a voice from the cloud that said – ‘This is my dearly loved son, who brings me great joy; listen to him.’
040	MAT	017	006	The disciples, on hearing this, fell on their faces, greatly afraid.
040	MAT	017	007	But Jesus came and touched them, saying as he did so, ‘Rise up, and do not be afraid.’
040	MAT	017	008	When they raised their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus himself alone.
040	MAT	017	009	As they were going down the mountain side, Jesus gave them this warning – ‘Do not speak of this vision to anyone, until the Son of Man has risen from the dead.’
040	MAT	017	010	‘How is it,’ his disciples asked, ‘that our teachers of the Law say that Elijah has to come first?’
040	MAT	017	011	‘Elijah indeed does come,’ Jesus replied, ‘and will restore everything;
040	MAT	017	012	and I tell you that Elijah has already come, and people have not recognised him, but have treated him just as they pleased. In the same way, too, the Son of Man is destined to undergo suffering at people’s hands.’
040	MAT	017	013	Then the disciples understood that he had spoken to them about John the Baptist.
040	MAT	017	014	When they came to the crowd, a man came up to Jesus, and, kneeling down before him, said,
040	MAT	017	015	‘Master, take pity on my son, for he is epileptic and suffers terribly; indeed, he often falls into the fire and into the water;
040	MAT	017	016	I brought him to your disciples, but they could not cure him.’
040	MAT	017	017	‘Faithless and perverse generation!’ Jesus exclaimed, ‘how long must I be among you? How long must I have patience with you? Bring the boy here to me.’
040	MAT	017	018	Then Jesus rebuked the demon, and it came out of the boy; and he was cured from that very hour.
040	MAT	017	019	Afterwards the disciples came up to Jesus, and asked him privately, ‘Why was it that we could not drive it out?’
040	MAT	017	020	‘Because you have so little faith!’ he answered, ‘For, I tell you, if your faith were only like a mustard seed, you could say to this mountain “Move from this place to that!” and it would be moved; and nothing would be impossible to you.’
040	MAT	017	022	While Jesus and his disciples were together in Galilee, he said to them, ‘The Son of Man is destined to be betrayed into human hands,
040	MAT	017	023	and they will put him to death, but on the third day he will rise.’ The disciples were greatly distressed.
040	MAT	017	024	After they had reached Capernaum, the collectors of the Temple tax came up to Peter, and said, ‘Does not your Master pay the Temple tax?’
040	MAT	017	025	‘Yes,’ answered Peter. But, on going into the house, before he could speak, Jesus said, ‘What do you think, Simon? From whom do earthly kings take taxes or tribute? From their sons, or from others?’
040	MAT	017	026	‘From others,’ answered Peter. ‘Well then,’ continued Jesus, ‘their sons go free.
040	MAT	017	027	Still, so we don’t offend them, go and throw a line into the sea; take the first fish that rises, open its mouth, and you will find in it a piece of money. Take that, and give it to the collectors for both of us.’
040	MAT	018	001	On the same occasion the disciples came to Jesus, and asked him, ‘Who is really the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?’
040	MAT	018	002	Jesus called a little child to him, and placed it in the middle of them, and then said,
040	MAT	018	003	‘I tell you, unless you change and become like little children, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven at all.
040	MAT	018	004	Therefore, anyone who will humble themselves like this child – that person will be the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
040	MAT	018	005	And anyone who, for the sake of my name, welcomes even one little child like this, is welcoming me.
040	MAT	018	006	But, if anyone puts temptation in the way of one of these little ones who believe in me, it would be best for them to be sunk in the depths of the sea with a great millstone hung round their neck.
040	MAT	018	007	Alas for the world because of such temptations! There cannot but be temptations but sorrow awaits the person who does the tempting!
040	MAT	018	008	‘If your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off, and throw it away. It would be better for you to enter life maimed or lame, than to have both hands, or both feet, and be thrown into the fire that never goes out.
040	MAT	018	009	If your eye causes you to sin, take it out, and throw it away. It would be better for you to enter life with only one eye, than to have both eyes and be thrown into the fires of Gehenna.
040	MAT	018	010	Beware of despising one of these little ones, for in heaven, I tell you, their angels always see the face of my Father who is in heaven.
040	MAT	018	012	‘What think you? If a person owns a hundred sheep, and one of them strays, will the person not leave the ninety-nine on the hills, and go and search for the one that is straying?
040	MAT	018	013	And, if they succeed in finding it, I tell you that they rejoice more over that one sheep than over the ninety-nine which did not stray.
040	MAT	018	014	So, too, it is the will of my Father who is in heaven that not one of these little ones should be lost.
040	MAT	018	015	‘If your brother or sister does wrong, go to them and convince them of their fault when you are both alone. If they listen to you, you have won them over.
040	MAT	018	016	But, if they do not listen to you, take with you one or two others, so that on the evidence of two or three witnesses, every word may be put beyond dispute.
040	MAT	018	017	If they refuse to listen to them, speak to the church; and, if they also refuse to listen to the church, treat him as you would a Gentile or a tax-gatherer.
040	MAT	018	018	‘I tell you, all that you forbid on earth will be held in heaven to be forbidden, and all that you allow on earth will be held in heaven to be allowed.
040	MAT	018	019	Again, I tell you that, if but two of you on earth agree as to what they will pray for, whatever it be, it will be granted them by my Father who is in heaven.
040	MAT	018	020	For where two or three have come together in my name, I am present with them.’
040	MAT	018	021	Then Peter came up, and said to Jesus, ‘Master, how often am I to forgive someone who wrongs me? As many as seven times?’
040	MAT	018	022	But Jesus answered, ‘Not seven times, but seventy times seven.
040	MAT	018	023	Therefore the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who wished to settle accounts with his servants.
040	MAT	018	024	When he had begun to do so, one of them was brought to him who owed him ten thousand bags of gold;
040	MAT	018	025	and, as he could not pay, his master ordered him to be sold towards the payment of the debt, together with his wife, and his children, and everything that he had.
040	MAT	018	026	The servant threw himself down on the ground before him and said “Have patience with me, and I will pay you all.”
040	MAT	018	027	The master was moved with compassion; and he let him go, and forgave him the debt.
040	MAT	018	028	But, on going out, that same servant came upon one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred silver coins. Seizing him by the throat, he said “Pay what you owe me.”
040	MAT	018	029	His fellow servant threw himself on the ground and begged for mercy. “Have patience with me,” he said, “and I will pay you.”
040	MAT	018	030	But the other would not, but went and put him in prison until he should pay his debt.
040	MAT	018	031	When his fellow servants saw what had happened, they were greatly distressed, and went to their master and laid the whole matter before him.
040	MAT	018	032	So the master sent for the servant, and said to him “You wicked servant! When you begged me for mercy, I forgave you the whole of that debt.
040	MAT	018	033	Shouldn’t you, also, to have shown mercy to your fellow servant, just as I showed mercy to you?”
040	MAT	018	034	Then his master, in anger, handed him over to the jailers, until he should pay the whole of his debt.
040	MAT	018	035	So, also, will my heavenly Father do to you, unless each one of you forgives his brother or sister from your heart.’
040	MAT	019	001	At the conclusion of this teaching, Jesus withdrew from Galilee, and went into that district of Judea which is on the other side of the Jordan.
040	MAT	019	002	Great crowds followed him, and he cured them there.
040	MAT	019	003	Presently some Pharisees came up to him, and, to test him, said, ‘Has a man the right to divorce his wife for every cause?’
040	MAT	019	004	‘Haven’t you read,’ replied Jesus, ‘that at the beginning the Creator “made them male and female,”
040	MAT	019	005	and said – “For this reason a man will leave his father and mother, and be united to his wife, and the man and his wife will become one”?
040	MAT	019	006	So that they are no longer two, but one. What God himself, then, has yoked together people must not separate.’
040	MAT	019	007	‘Why, then,’ they said, ‘did Moses direct that a man should serve his wife with a notice of separation and divorce her?’
040	MAT	019	008	‘Moses, owing to the hardness of your hearts,’ answered Jesus, ‘permitted you to divorce your wives, but that was not so at the beginning.
040	MAT	019	009	But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except on the ground of some serious sexual sin, and marries another woman, is guilty of adultery.’
040	MAT	019	010	‘If that,’ said the disciples, ‘is the position of a man with regard to his wife, it is better not to marry.’
040	MAT	019	011	‘It is not everyone,’ replied Jesus, ‘who can accept this teaching, but only those who have been enabled to do so.
040	MAT	019	012	Some men are incapable of marriage because they were born that way, or have been made so by other people, while there are others who stay single for the sake of the kingdom of Heaven. Accept this if you can.’
040	MAT	019	013	Then some little children were brought to Jesus, for him to place his hands on them, and pray; but the disciples found fault with those who had brought them.
040	MAT	019	014	Jesus, however, said, ‘Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for it is to the childlike that the kingdom of heaven belongs.’
040	MAT	019	015	So he placed his hands on them, and then went on his way.
040	MAT	019	016	A man came up to Jesus, and said, ‘Teacher, what good thing must I do to obtain eternal life?’
040	MAT	019	017	‘Why ask me about goodness?’ answered Jesus. ‘There is only one who is good. If you want to enter life, keep the commandments.’
040	MAT	019	018	‘What commandments?’ asked the man. ‘These,’ answered Jesus, – ‘“You must not kill. You must not commit adultery. You must not steal. You must not say what is false about others.
040	MAT	019	019	Honour your father and your mother.” And “You must love your neighbour as you love yourself.”’
040	MAT	019	020	‘I have observed all these,’ said the young man. ‘What is still wanting in me?’
040	MAT	019	021	‘If you wish to be perfect,’ answered Jesus, ‘go and sell your property, and give to the poor, and you will have wealth in heaven; then come and follow me.’
040	MAT	019	022	On hearing these words, the young man went away distressed, for he had great possessions.
040	MAT	019	023	At this, Jesus said to his disciples, ‘I tell you that a rich person will find it hard to enter the kingdom of heaven!
040	MAT	019	024	I say again, it is easier for a camel to get through a needle’s eye than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of heaven!’
040	MAT	019	025	On hearing this, the disciples exclaimed in great astonishment, ‘Who then can possibly be saved?’
040	MAT	019	026	But Jesus looked at them, and said, ‘With people this is impossible, but with God everything is possible.’ Then Peter turned and said to Jesus,
040	MAT	019	027	‘But we – we left everything, and followed you; what, then, will we have?’
040	MAT	019	028	‘I tell you,’ answered Jesus, ‘that at the new creation, when the Son of Man takes his seat on his throne of glory, you who followed me will be seated on twelve thrones, as judges of the twelve tribes of Israel.
040	MAT	019	029	Everyone who has left houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or children, or land, for my sake, will receive many times as much, and will gain eternal life.
040	MAT	019	030	But many who are first now will then be last, and those who are last will be first.
040	MAT	020	001	For the kingdom of heaven is like an employer who went out in the early morning to hire labourers for his vineyards.
040	MAT	020	002	He agreed with the labourers to pay them the standard daily rate of two silver coins, and sent them into his vineyard.
040	MAT	020	003	On going out again, about nine o’clock, he saw some others standing in the marketplace, doing nothing.
040	MAT	020	004	“You also may go into my vineyard,” he said, “and I will pay you what is fair.”
040	MAT	020	005	So they went. Going out again about midday and about three o’clock, he did as before.
040	MAT	020	006	When he went out about five, he found some others standing there, and said to them “Why have you been standing here all day long, doing nothing?”
040	MAT	020	007	“Because no one has hired us,” they answered. “You also may go into my vineyard,” he said.
040	MAT	020	008	In the evening the owner of the vineyard said to his steward “Call the labourers, and pay them their wages, beginning with the last, and ending with the first.”
040	MAT	020	009	Now when those who had been hired about five o’clock went up, they received two silver coins each.
040	MAT	020	010	So, when the first went up, they thought that they would receive more, but they also received two silver coins each;
040	MAT	020	011	at which they began to grumble at their employer.
040	MAT	020	012	“These last,” they said, “have done only one hour’s work, and yet you have put them on the same footing with us, who have borne the brunt of the day’s work, and the heat.”
040	MAT	020	013	“My friend,” was his reply to one of them, “I am not treating you unfairly. Didn’t you agree with me for two silver coins?
040	MAT	020	014	Take what belongs to you, and go. I choose to give to this last man the same as to you.
040	MAT	020	015	Don’t I have the right to do as I choose with what is mine? Are you envious because I am generous?”
040	MAT	020	016	So those who are last will be first, and the first last.’
040	MAT	020	017	When Jesus was on the point of going up to Jerusalem, he gathered the twelve disciples round him by themselves, and said to them as they were on their way,
040	MAT	020	018	‘Listen! We are going up to Jerusalem; and there the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and teachers of the Law, and they will condemn him to death,
040	MAT	020	019	and give him up to the Gentiles for them to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify; and on the third day he will rise.’
040	MAT	020	020	Then the mother of Zebedee’s sons came to him with her sons, bowing to the ground, and begging a favour.
040	MAT	020	021	‘What is it that you want?’ he asked. ‘I want you to say,’ she replied, ‘that in your kingdom these two sons of mine may sit, one on your right, and the other on your left.’
040	MAT	020	022	‘You do not know what you are asking,’ was Jesus’ answer. ‘Can you drink the cup that I am to drink?’ ‘Yes,’ they exclaimed, ‘we can.’
040	MAT	020	023	‘You will indeed drink my cup,’ he said, ‘but as to a seat at my right and at my left – that is not mine to give, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father.’
040	MAT	020	024	On hearing of this, the ten others were very indignant about the two brothers.
040	MAT	020	025	Jesus, however, called the ten to him, and said, ‘The rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them as you know, and their high officials oppress them.
040	MAT	020	026	Among you it is not so.
040	MAT	020	027	No, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, and whoever wants to take the first place among you, must be your slave;
040	MAT	020	028	just as the Son of Man came, not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.’
040	MAT	020	029	As they were going out of Jericho, a great crowd followed him.
040	MAT	020	030	Two blind men who were sitting by the roadside, hearing that Jesus was passing, called out, ‘Take pity on us, Master, Son of David!’
040	MAT	020	031	The crowd told them to be quiet; but the men only called out the louder, ‘Take pity on us, Master, Son of David!’
040	MAT	020	032	Then Jesus stopped and called them. ‘What do you want me to do for you?’ he said.
040	MAT	020	033	‘Master,’ they replied, ‘we want our eyes to be opened.’
040	MAT	020	034	So Jesus, moved with compassion, touched their eyes, and immediately they recovered their sight, and followed him.
040	MAT	021	001	When they had almost reached Jerusalem, having come as far as Bethphage, on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent on two disciples.
040	MAT	021	002	‘Go to the village facing you,’ he said, ‘and you will immediately find a donkey tethered, with a foal by her side; untie her, and lead her here for me.
040	MAT	021	003	And, if anyone says anything to you, you are to say this – “The Master wants them”; and he will send them at once.’
040	MAT	021	004	This happened in fulfilment of these words in the prophet –
040	MAT	021	005	“Say to the people of Zion – ‘Your King is coming to you, gentle, and riding on a donkey, and on the foal of a beast of burden.’”
040	MAT	021	006	So the disciples went and did as Jesus had directed them.
040	MAT	021	007	They led the donkey and the foal back, and, when they had put their cloaks on them, he seated himself on them.
040	MAT	021	008	The immense crowd of people spread their cloaks in the road, while some cut branches off the trees, and spread them on the road.
040	MAT	021	009	The crowds that led the way, as well as those that followed behind, kept shouting, ‘God save the Son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! God save him from on high!’
040	MAT	021	010	When he had entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred, and asked –
040	MAT	021	011	‘Who is this?’, to which the crowd replied – ‘This is the prophet Jesus from Nazareth in Galilee.’
040	MAT	021	012	Jesus went into the Temple Courts, and drove out all those who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers, and the seats of the pigeon-dealers,
040	MAT	021	013	and said to them, ‘Scripture says “My house will be called a house of prayer”; but you are making it a den of robbers.’
040	MAT	021	014	While he was still in the Temple Courts, some blind and some lame people came up to him, and he cured them.
040	MAT	021	015	But, when the chief priests and the teachers of the Law saw the wonderful things that Jesus did, and the boys who were calling out in the Temple Courts ‘God save the Son of David!’, they were indignant,
040	MAT	021	016	and said to him, ‘Do you hear what these boys are saying?’ ‘Yes,’ answered Jesus, ‘but did you never read the words – “Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings you have called forth perfect praise”?’
040	MAT	021	017	Then he left them, and went out of the city to Bethany, and spent the night there.
040	MAT	021	018	The next morning, in returning to the city, Jesus became hungry;
040	MAT	021	019	and, noticing a solitary fig tree by the roadside, he went up to it, but found nothing on it but leaves. So he said to it, ‘Never again will fruit be gathered off you.’ And suddenly the fruit tree withered up.
040	MAT	021	020	When the disciples saw this, they exclaimed in astonishment, ‘How suddenly the fig tree withered up!’
040	MAT	021	021	‘I tell you,’ replied Jesus, ‘if you have faith and don’t doubt, you will not only do what has been done to the fig tree, but even if you were to say to this hill “Be lifted up and hurled into the sea!” it would be done.
040	MAT	021	022	And whatever you ask for in your prayers will, if you have faith, be granted you.’
040	MAT	021	023	After Jesus had come into the Temple Courts, the chief priests and the elders of the people came up to him as he was teaching, and said, ‘What authority have you to do these things? Who gave you this authority?’
040	MAT	021	024	‘I, too,’ said Jesus in reply, ‘will ask you one question; if you will give me an answer to it, then I, also, will tell you what authority I have to act as I do.
040	MAT	021	025	It is about John’s baptism. What was its origin? Divine or human?’ But they began arguing among themselves, ‘If we say “divine,” he will say to us “Why then didn’t you believe him?”
040	MAT	021	026	But if we say “human,” we are afraid of the people, for everyone regards John as a prophet.’
040	MAT	021	027	So the answer they gave Jesus was – ‘We do not know.’ ‘Then I,’ he said, ‘refuse to tell you what authority I have to do these things.
040	MAT	021	028	What do you think of this? There was a man who had two sons. He went to the elder and said “Go and work in the vineyard today my son.”
040	MAT	021	029	“Yes, sir,” he answered; but he did not go.
040	MAT	021	030	Then the father went to the second son, and said the same. “I will not,” he answered; but afterwards he was sorry and went.
040	MAT	021	031	Which of the two sons did as his father wished?’ ‘The second,’ they said. ‘I tell you,’ added Jesus, ‘that tax collectors and prostitutes are going into the kingdom of God before you.
040	MAT	021	032	For when John came to you, walking in the path of righteousness, you did not believe him, but tax collectors and prostitutes did; and yet you, though you saw this, even then were not sorry, nor did you believe him.
040	MAT	021	033	‘Listen to another parable. A man, who was an employer, once planted a vineyard, put a fence round it, dug a winepress in it, built a tower, and then let it out to tenants and went abroad.
040	MAT	021	034	When the time for the grape harvest drew near, he sent his servants to the tenants, to receive his share of the produce.
040	MAT	021	035	But the tenants seized his servants, beat one, killed another, and stoned a third.
040	MAT	021	036	A second time the owner sent some servants, a larger number than before, and the tenants treated them in the same way.
040	MAT	021	037	As a last resort he sent his son to them. “They will respect my son,” he said.
040	MAT	021	038	But the tenants, on seeing his son, said to each other “Here is the heir! Come, let us kill him, and get his inheritance.”
040	MAT	021	039	So they seized him, and threw him outside the vineyard, and killed him.
040	MAT	021	040	Now, when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants?’
040	MAT	021	041	‘Miserable wretches!’ they exclaimed, ‘he will put them to a miserable death, and he will let out the vineyard to other tenants, who will pay him his share of the produce at the proper times.’
040	MAT	021	042	Then Jesus added, ‘Have you never read in the scriptures? – “The stone which the builders despised – has now itself become the cornerstone. This cornerstone has come from the Lord, and is marvellous in our eyes.”
040	MAT	021	043	That, I tell you, is why the kingdom of God will be taken from you, and given to a nation that does produce the fruit of the kingdom.
040	MAT	021	044	Yes, and he who falls on this stone will be dashed to pieces, while anyone on whom it falls – it will scatter him as dust.’
040	MAT	021	045	After listening to these parables, the chief priests and the Pharisees saw that it was about them that he was speaking;
040	MAT	021	046	yet, although eager to arrest him, they were afraid of the crowds, who regarded him as a prophet.
040	MAT	022	001	Once more Jesus spoke to them in parables.
040	MAT	022	002	‘The kingdom of heaven,’ he said, ‘may be compared to a king who gave a banquet in honour of his son’s wedding.
040	MAT	022	003	He sent his servants to call those who had been invited to the banquet, but they were unwilling to come.
040	MAT	022	004	A second time he sent some servants, with orders to say to those who had been invited “I have prepared my meal, my cattle and fat beasts are killed and everything is ready; come to the banquet.”
040	MAT	022	005	They, however, took no notice, but went off, one to their farm, another to their business;
040	MAT	022	006	while the rest, seizing his servants, ill-treated them and killed them.
040	MAT	022	007	The king, in anger, sent his troops, put those murderers to death, and set their city on fire.
040	MAT	022	008	Then he said to his servants “The banquet is prepared, but those who were invited were not worthy.
040	MAT	022	009	So go to the cross-roads, and invite everyone you find to the banquet.”
040	MAT	022	010	The servants went out into the roads and collected all the people whom they found, whether bad or good; and the bridal-hall was filled with guests.
040	MAT	022	011	But, when the king went in to see his guests, he noticed there a man who had not put on a wedding-robe.
040	MAT	022	012	So he said to him “My friend, how is it that you came in here without a wedding-robe?” The man was speechless.
040	MAT	022	013	Then the king said to the attendants “Tie him hand and foot, and put him out into the darkness outside, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth.”
040	MAT	022	014	For many are called, but few chosen.’
040	MAT	022	015	Then the Pharisees went away and conferred together as to how they might lay a trap for Jesus in the course of conversation.
040	MAT	022	016	They sent their disciples, with the Herodians, to say to him, ‘Teacher, we know that you are an honest person, and that you teach the way of God honestly, and are not afraid of anyone; for you pay no regard to a person’s position.
040	MAT	022	017	Tell us, then, what you think. Are we right in paying taxes to the Emperor, or not?’
040	MAT	022	018	Perceiving their malice, Jesus answered, ‘Why are you testing me, you hypocrites?
040	MAT	022	019	Show me the coin with which the tax is paid.’ And, when they had brought him a coin,
040	MAT	022	020	he asked, ‘Whose head and title are these?’
040	MAT	022	021	‘The Emperor’s,’ they answered, at which he said to them, ‘Then pay to the Emperor what belongs to the Emperor, and to God what belongs to God.’
040	MAT	022	022	They wondered at his answer, and left him alone and went away.
040	MAT	022	023	That same day some Sadducees came up to Jesus, maintaining that there is no resurrection. Their question was this, –
040	MAT	022	024	‘Teacher, Moses said – “should a man die without children, the man’s brother will become the husband of the widow, and raise a family for his brother.”
040	MAT	022	025	Now we had living among us seven brothers; of whom the eldest married and died, and, as he had no family, left his wife for his brother.
040	MAT	022	026	The same thing happened to the second and the third brothers, and indeed to all the seven.
040	MAT	022	027	The woman herself died last of all.
040	MAT	022	028	At the resurrection, then, whose wife will she be out of the seven, all of them having been married to her?’
040	MAT	022	029	‘Your mistake,’ replied Jesus, ‘is due to your ignorance of the scriptures, and of the power of God.
040	MAT	022	030	For at the resurrection there is no marrying or being married, but all who rise are as angels in heaven.
040	MAT	022	031	As to the resurrection of the dead, have you not read these words of God –
040	MAT	022	032	“I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob”? He is not the God of dead people, but of living.’
040	MAT	022	033	The crowds, who had been listening to him, were greatly struck with his teaching.
040	MAT	022	034	When the Pharisees heard that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, they collected together.
040	MAT	022	035	Then one of them, a Student of the Law, to test him, asked this question –
040	MAT	022	036	‘Teacher, what is the greatest commandment in the Law?’
040	MAT	022	037	His answer was, ‘You must love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.
040	MAT	022	038	This is the great first commandment.
040	MAT	022	039	The second, which is like it, is this – You must love your neighbour as you love yourself.
040	MAT	022	040	On these two commandments hang all the Law and the prophets.’
040	MAT	022	041	Before the Pharisees separated, Jesus put this question to them –
040	MAT	022	042	‘What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?’ ‘David’s,’ they said.
040	MAT	022	043	‘How is it, then,’ Jesus replied, ‘that David, speaking under inspiration, calls him “lord,” in the passage –
040	MAT	022	044	“The Lord said to my Lord: Sit at my right hand, until I put your enemies beneath your feet”?
040	MAT	022	045	Since, then, David calls him “lord,” how is he David’s son?’
040	MAT	022	046	No one could say a word in answer; nor did anyone after that day venture to question him further.
040	MAT	023	001	Then Jesus, speaking to the crowds and to his disciples, said,
040	MAT	023	002	‘The teachers of the Law and the Pharisees now occupy the chair of Moses.
040	MAT	023	003	Therefore practice and lay to heart everything that they preach but do not practice.
040	MAT	023	004	While they make up heavy loads and pile them on other people’s shoulder’s they decline, themselves, to lift a finger to move them.
040	MAT	023	005	All their actions are done to attract attention. They widen their phylacteries, and increase the size of their tassels,
040	MAT	023	006	and like to have the place of honour at dinner, and the best seats in the synagogues,
040	MAT	023	007	and to be greeted in the markets with respect, and to be called “Rabbi” by everybody.
040	MAT	023	008	But do not allow yourselves to be called “Rabbi,” for you have only one teacher, and you yourselves are all brothers and sisters.
040	MAT	023	009	And do not call anyone on the earth your “Father,” for you have only one Father, the heavenly Father.
040	MAT	023	010	Nor must you allow yourselves to be called “leaders,” for you have only one leader, the Christ.
040	MAT	023	011	The person who wants to be the greatest among you must be your servant.
040	MAT	023	012	Whoever exalts themselves will be humbled, and whoever humbles themselves will be exalted.
040	MAT	023	013	But alas for you, teachers of the Law and Pharisees, hypocrites that you are! You turn the key of the kingdom of heaven in people’s faces. For you do not go in yourselves, and do not allow those who try to go in to do so.
040	MAT	023	015	Alas for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, hypocrites that you are! You scour land and sea to make a single convert, and, when they are gained, you make them twice as deserving of Gehenna as you are yourselves.
040	MAT	023	016	Alas for you, you blind guides! You say “if any swear by the Temple, their oath counts for nothing; but, if anyone swears by the gold of the Temple, their oath is binding them”!
040	MAT	023	017	Fools that you are and blind! Which is the more important? The gold? Or the Temple which has given sacredness to the gold?
040	MAT	023	018	You say, too, “If anyone swears by the altar, their oath counts for nothing, but, if anyone swears by the offering placed on it, their oath is binding on them”!
040	MAT	023	019	Blind indeed! Which is the more important? The offering? Or the altar which gives sacredness to the offering?
040	MAT	023	020	Therefore a person, swearing by the altar, swears by it and by all that is on it,
040	MAT	023	021	and a person, swearing by the Temple, swears by it and by him who dwells in it,
040	MAT	023	022	while a person, swearing by heaven, swears by the throne of God, and by him who sits on it.
040	MAT	023	023	Alas for you, teachers of the Law and Pharisees, hypocrites that you are! You pay tithes on mint, fennel, and caraway seed, and have neglected the weightier matters of the Law – justice, mercy, and good faith. These last you ought to have put into practice, without neglecting the first.
040	MAT	023	024	You blind guides, to strain out a gnat and to swallow a camel!
040	MAT	023	025	Alas for you, teachers of the Law and Pharisees, hypocrites that you are! You clean the outside of the cup and the dish, but inside they are filled with the results of greed and self-indulgence.
040	MAT	023	026	You blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and the dish, so that the outside may become clean as well.
040	MAT	023	027	Alas for you, teachers of the Law and Pharisees, hypocrites that you are! You are like whitewashed tombs, which indeed look fair outside, while inside they are filled with dead people’s bones and all kinds of filth.
040	MAT	023	028	It is the same with you. Outwardly, and to others, you have the look of religious people, but inwardly you are full of hypocrisy and sin.
040	MAT	023	029	Alas for you, teachers of the Law and Pharisees, hypocrites that you are! You build the tombs of the prophets, and decorate the monuments of religious people,
040	MAT	023	030	and say “Had we been living in the days of our ancestors, we should have taken no part in their murder of the prophets!”
040	MAT	023	031	By doing this you are furnishing evidence against yourselves that you are true children of the people who murdered the prophets.
040	MAT	023	032	Go on then, finish what your ancestors began!
040	MAT	023	033	You snakes and children of snakes! How can you escape being sentenced to Gehenna?
040	MAT	023	034	That is why I send you prophets, wise people, and teachers of the Law, some of whom you will crucify and kill, and some of whom you will scourge in your synagogues, and persecute from town to town;
040	MAT	023	035	so that on your heads may fall every drop of innocent blood spilt on earth, from the blood of innocent Abel down to that of Zechariah, Barachiah’s son, whom you murdered between the Temple and the altar.
040	MAT	023	036	All this, I tell you, will come home to the present generation.
040	MAT	023	037	Jerusalem! Jerusalem! She who slays the prophets and stones the messengers sent to her – Oh, how often have I wished to gather your children round me, as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you would not come!
040	MAT	023	038	Verily, your house is left to you desolate!
040	MAT	023	039	For nevermore, I tell you, will you see me, until you say – “Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!”’
040	MAT	024	001	Leaving the Temple Courts, Jesus was walking away, when his disciples came up to draw his attention to the Temple buildings.
040	MAT	024	002	‘Do you see all these things?’ was his answer. ‘I tell you, not a single stone will be left here on another, which will not be thrown down,’
040	MAT	024	003	so, while Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, his disciples came up to him privately and said, ‘Tell us when this will be, and what will be the sign of your coming, and of the close of the age.’
040	MAT	024	004	Jesus replied to them, ‘See that no one leads you astray;
040	MAT	024	005	for, many will take my name, and come saying “I am the Christ,” and will lead many astray.
040	MAT	024	006	You will hear of wars and rumours of wars; take care not to be alarmed, for such things must occur; but the end is not yet here.
040	MAT	024	007	For nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places.
040	MAT	024	008	All this, however, will be but the beginning of the birth pangs!
040	MAT	024	009	When that time comes, they will give you up to persecution, and will put you to death, and you will be hated by all nations because of me.
040	MAT	024	010	And then many will fall away, and will betray one another, and hate one another.
040	MAT	024	011	Many false prophets, also, will appear and lead many astray;
040	MAT	024	012	and, owing to the increase of wickedness, the love of most will grow cold.
040	MAT	024	013	Yet the person who endures to the end will be saved.
040	MAT	024	014	This good news of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the world as a witness to all nations; and then will come the end.
040	MAT	024	015	As soon, then, as you see “the Foul Desecration,” mentioned by the prophet Daniel, standing in the Holy place,’ (the reader must consider what this means)
040	MAT	024	016	‘then those of you who are in Judea must take refuge in the mountains;
040	MAT	024	017	and a man on the housetop must not go down to get the things that are in his house;
040	MAT	024	018	nor must one who is on their farm turn back to get his cloak.
040	MAT	024	019	Alas for pregnant women, and for those who are nursing infants in those days!
040	MAT	024	020	Pray, too, that your flight may not take place in winter, nor on a Sabbath;
040	MAT	024	021	for that will be a time of great distress, the like of which has not occurred from the beginning of the world down to the present time – no, nor ever will again.
040	MAT	024	022	Had not those days been limited, not a single soul would escape; but for the sake of God’s people a limit will be put to them.
040	MAT	024	023	At that time, if anyone should say to you “Look! Here is the Christ!” or “Here he is!”, do not believe it;
040	MAT	024	024	for false Christs and false prophets will arise, and will display great signs and marvels, so that, were it possible, even God’s people would be led astray.
040	MAT	024	025	Remember, I have told you beforehand.
040	MAT	024	026	Therefore, if people say to you “He is in the wilderness!”, do not go out there; or “He is in an inner room!”, do not believe it;
040	MAT	024	027	for, just as lightning will start from the east and flash across to the west, so will it be with the coming of the Son of Man.
040	MAT	024	028	Wherever a dead body lies, there will the vultures flock.
040	MAT	024	029	Immediately after the distress of those days, the sun will be darkened, the moon will not give her light, the stars will fall from the heavens, and the forces of the heavens will be convulsed.
040	MAT	024	030	Then will appear the sign of the Son of Man in the heavens; and all the peoples of the earth will mourn, when they see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the heavens, with power and great glory;
040	MAT	024	031	and he will send his angels, with a great trumpet, and they will gather his people round him from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.
040	MAT	024	032	‘Learn the lesson taught by the fig tree. As soon as its branches are full of sap, and it is bursting into leaf, you know that summer is near.
040	MAT	024	033	And so may you, as soon as you see all these things, know that he is at your doors.
040	MAT	024	034	I tell you, even the present generation will not pass away, until all these things have taken place.
040	MAT	024	035	The heavens and the earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.
040	MAT	024	036	But about that day and hour, no one knows – not even the angels of heaven, not even the Son – but only the Father himself.
040	MAT	024	037	For, just as in the days of Noah, so will it be at the coming of the Son of Man.
040	MAT	024	038	In those days before the flood they went on eating and drinking, marrying and being married, up to the very day on which Noah entered the ark.
040	MAT	024	039	They didn’t realise what was going to happen until the flood came and swept them one and all away; and so will it be at the coming of the Son of Man.
040	MAT	024	040	At that time, of two men on a farm one will be taken and one left;
040	MAT	024	041	of two women grinding with a hand-mill one will be taken and one left.
040	MAT	024	042	Therefore watch; for you cannot be sure on what day your Master is coming.
040	MAT	024	043	But this you do know, that, had the owner of the house known at what time of night the thief was coming, they would have been on the watch, and would not have allowed their house to be broken into.
040	MAT	024	044	Therefore, you must also prepare, since it is just when you are least expecting him that the Son of Man will come.
040	MAT	024	045	Who, then is that trustworthy, careful servant, who has been placed by their master over his household, to give them their food at the proper time?
040	MAT	024	046	Happy will that servant be whom their master, when he comes home, will find doing this.
040	MAT	024	047	I tell you that their master will put them in charge of the whole of his property.
040	MAT	024	048	But, should the servant be a bad servant, and say to themselves “My master is a long time in coming,”
040	MAT	024	049	and begin to beat their fellow servants, and eat and drink with drunkards,
040	MAT	024	050	that servant’s master will come on a day when they do not expect him, and at an hour of which they are unaware,
040	MAT	024	051	and will flog the servant severely, and assign them their place among the hypocrites, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth.
040	MAT	025	001	‘Then the kingdom of heaven will be like ten bridesmaids who took their lamps and went out to meet the groom.
040	MAT	025	002	Five of them were foolish, and five were prudent.
040	MAT	025	003	The foolish ones took their lamps, but took no oil with them;
040	MAT	025	004	while the prudent ones, besides taking their lamps, took oil in their jars.
040	MAT	025	005	As the groom was late in coming, they all became drowsy, and slept.
040	MAT	025	006	But at midnight a shout was raised – “The groom is coming! Come out to meet him!”
040	MAT	025	007	Then all the bridesmaids woke up and trimmed their lamps,
040	MAT	025	008	and the foolish said to the prudent “Give us some of your oil; our lamps are going out.”
040	MAT	025	009	But the prudent ones answered “No, There may not be enough for you and for us. Go instead to those who sell it, and buy for yourselves.”
040	MAT	025	010	But while they were on their way to buy it, the groom came; and the bridesmaids who were ready went in with him to the banquet, and the door was shut.
040	MAT	025	011	Afterwards the other bridesmaids came. “Sir, Sir,” they said, “open the door to us!”
040	MAT	025	012	But the groom answered “I tell you, I do not know you.”
040	MAT	025	013	Therefore watch, since you know neither the day nor the hour.
040	MAT	025	014	‘For it is as though a man, going on his travels, called his servants, and gave his property into their charge.
040	MAT	025	015	He gave five bags of gold to one, two to another, and one bag to a third, in proportion to the ability of each. Then he set out on his travels.
040	MAT	025	016	The servant who had received the five bags of gold went at once and traded with it, and made another five bags.
040	MAT	025	017	So, too, the servant who had received the two bags of gold made another two bags.
040	MAT	025	018	But the servant who had received the one bag went and dug a hole in the ground, and hid his master’s money.
040	MAT	025	019	After a long time the master of those servants returned, and settled accounts with them.
040	MAT	025	020	The servant who had received the five bags of gold came up and brought five bags more. “Sir,” he said, “you entrusted me with five bags of gold; look, I have made another five bags!”
040	MAT	025	021	“Well done, good, trustworthy servant!” said his master. “You have been trustworthy with a small sum; now I will place a large one in your hands; come and share your master’s joy!”
040	MAT	025	022	Then the one who had received the two bags of gold came up and said “Sir, you entrusted me with two bags of gold. Look, I have made another two!”
040	MAT	025	023	“Well done, good, trustworthy servant!” said his master. “You have been trustworthy with a small sum; now I will place a large one in your hands; come and share your master’s joy!”
040	MAT	025	024	The man who had received the single bag of gold came up, too, and said “Sir, I knew that you were a hard man; you reap where you have not sown, and gather up where you have not winnowed;
040	MAT	025	025	and, in my fear, I went and hid your money in the ground; look, here is what belongs to you!”
040	MAT	025	026	“You lazy, worthless servant!” was his master’s reply. “You knew that I reap where I have not sown, and gather up where I have not winnowed?
040	MAT	025	027	Then you ought to have placed my money in the hands of bankers, and I, on my return, should have received my money, with interest.
040	MAT	025	028	Therefore,” he continued, “take away from him the one bag of gold, and give it to the one who has the ten bags.
040	MAT	025	029	For, to him who has, more will be given, and he will have abundance; but, as for him who has nothing, even what he has will be taken away from him.
040	MAT	025	030	As for the useless servant, put him out into the darkness outside, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth.”
040	MAT	025	031	‘When the Son of Man has come in his glory and all the angels with him, then he will take his seat on his throne of glory;
040	MAT	025	032	and all the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate the people – just as a shepherd separates sheep from goats –
040	MAT	025	033	placing the sheep on his right hand, and the goats on his left.
040	MAT	025	034	Then the king will say to those on his right “Come, you who are blessed by my Father, enter into possession of the kingdom prepared for you ever since the beginning of the world.
040	MAT	025	035	For, when I was hungry, you gave me food; when I was thirsty, you gave me drink; when I was a stranger, you took me to your homes;
040	MAT	025	036	when I was naked, you clothed me; when I fell ill, you visited me; and when I was in prison, you came to me.”
040	MAT	025	037	Then the righteous will answer “Lord, when did we see you hungry, and feed you? Or thirsty, and give you a drink?
040	MAT	025	038	When did we see you a stranger, and take you to our homes? Or naked, and clothe you?
040	MAT	025	039	When did we see you ill, or in prison, and come to you?”
040	MAT	025	040	And the king will reply “I tell you, as often as you did it to one of these my brothers or sisters, however unimportant they seemed, you did it to me.”
040	MAT	025	041	Then he will say to those on his left “Go from my presence, accursed, into the permanent fire which has been prepared for the devil and his angels.
040	MAT	025	042	For, when I was hungry, you gave me no food; when I was thirsty, you gave me no drink;
040	MAT	025	043	when I was a stranger, you did not take me to your homes; when I was naked, you did not clothe me; and, when I was ill and in prison, you did not visit me.”
040	MAT	025	044	Then they, in their turn, will answer “Lord, when did we see you hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or ill, or in prison, and did not supply your wants?”
040	MAT	025	045	And then he will reply “I tell you, as often as you failed to do it to one of these, however unimportant, you failed to do it to me.”
040	MAT	025	046	And these last will go away into lasting correction, but the righteous into lasting life.’
040	MAT	026	001	When Jesus had finished teaching all of that, he said to his disciples,
040	MAT	026	002	‘You know that in two days time the Festival of the Passover will be here; and that the Son of Man is to be given up to be crucified.’
040	MAT	026	003	Then the chief priests and the elders of the people met in the house of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,
040	MAT	026	004	and plotted together to arrest Jesus by stealth and put him to death;
040	MAT	026	005	but they said, ‘Not during the Festival, or the people may riot.’
040	MAT	026	006	After Jesus had reached Bethany, and while he was in the house of Simon the leper,
040	MAT	026	007	a woman came up to him with an alabaster jar of very costly perfume, and poured the perfume on his head as he sat at the table.
040	MAT	026	008	The disciples were indignant at seeing this. ‘What is this waste for?’ they exclaimed.
040	MAT	026	009	‘It could have been sold for a large sum, and the money given to poor people.’
040	MAT	026	010	‘Why are you troubling the woman?’ Jesus said, when he noticed it. ‘For this is a beautiful deed that she has done to me.
040	MAT	026	011	You always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me.
040	MAT	026	012	In pouring this perfume on my body, she prepares me for my burial.
040	MAT	026	013	I tell you, wherever, in the whole world, this good news is proclaimed, what this woman has done will be told in memory of her.’
040	MAT	026	014	It was then that one of the Twelve, named Judas Iscariot, made his way to the chief priests,
040	MAT	026	015	and said ‘What are you willing to give me, if I betray Jesus to you?’ The Priests counted him out thirty pieces of silver as payment.
040	MAT	026	016	So from that time Judas looked for an opportunity to betray Jesus.
040	MAT	026	017	On the first day of the Festival of the unleavened bread, the disciples came up to Jesus, and said, ‘Where do you wish us to make preparations for you to eat the Passover?’
040	MAT	026	018	‘Go into the city to a certain man,’ he answered, ‘and say to him “The teacher says – My time is near. I will keep the Passover with my disciples at your house.”’
040	MAT	026	019	The disciples did as Jesus directed them, and prepared the Passover.
040	MAT	026	020	In the evening Jesus took his place with the twelve disciples,
040	MAT	026	021	and, while they were eating, he said, ‘I tell you that one of you will betray me.’
040	MAT	026	022	In great grief they began to say to him, one by one, ‘Can it be I, Master?’
040	MAT	026	023	‘The one who dipped his bread beside me in the dish,’ replied Jesus, ‘is the one who will betray me.
040	MAT	026	024	True, the Son of Man must go, as scripture says of him, yet alas for that man by whom the Son of Man is being betrayed! For that man it would be better never to have been born!’
040	MAT	026	025	Judas, who was betraying him, turned to him and said, ‘Can it be I, Rabbi?’ ‘It is,’ answered Jesus.
040	MAT	026	026	While they were eating, Jesus took some bread, and, after saying the blessing, broke it and, as he gave it to his disciples, said, ‘Take it and eat it; this is my body.’
040	MAT	026	027	Then he took a cup, and, after saying the thanksgiving, gave it to them, with the words, ‘Drink from it, all of you;
040	MAT	026	028	for this is my covenant blood, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.
040	MAT	026	029	I tell you that I will never, after this, drink of this juice of the grape, until that day when I will drink it new with you in the kingdom of my Father.’
040	MAT	026	030	They then sang a hymn, and went out to the Mount of Olives.
040	MAT	026	031	Then Jesus said to them, ‘Even you will all fall away from me tonight. Scripture says – “I will strike down the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.”
040	MAT	026	032	But, after I have risen, I will go before you into Galilee.’
040	MAT	026	033	‘If everyone else falls away from you,’ Peter answered, ‘I will never fall away!’
040	MAT	026	034	‘I tell you,’ replied Jesus, ‘that this very night, before the cock crows, you will disown me three times!’
040	MAT	026	035	‘Even if I must die with you,’ Peter exclaimed, ‘I will never disown you!’ All the disciples spoke in the same way.
040	MAT	026	036	Then Jesus came with them to a garden called Gethsemane, and he said to his disciples, ‘Sit down here while I go and pray over there.’
040	MAT	026	037	Taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to show signs of sadness and deep distress of mind.
040	MAT	026	038	‘I am sad at heart,’ he said, ‘sad even to death; wait here and watch with me.’
040	MAT	026	039	Going on a little further, he threw himself on his face in prayer. ‘My Father,’ he said, ‘if it is possible, let me be spared this cup; only, not as I will, but as you will.’
040	MAT	026	040	Then he came to his disciples, and found them asleep. ‘What!’ he said to Peter, ‘could none of you watch with me for one hour?
040	MAT	026	041	Watch and pray so that you don’t fall into temptation. True, the spirit is eager, but human nature is weak.’
040	MAT	026	042	Again, a second time, he went away, and prayed. ‘My Father,’ he said, ‘if I cannot be spared this cup, but must drink it, your will be done!’
040	MAT	026	043	And coming back again he found them asleep, for their eyes were heavy.
040	MAT	026	044	So he left them, and went away again, and prayed a third time, again saying the same words.
040	MAT	026	045	Then he came to the disciples, and said, ‘Sleep on now, and rest yourselves. Look – my time is close at hand, and the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of wicked people.
040	MAT	026	046	Up, and let us be going. Look! My betrayer is close at hand.’
040	MAT	026	047	And, while he was still speaking, Judas, who was one of the Twelve, came in sight; and with him was a great crowd of people, with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests and elders of the people.
040	MAT	026	048	Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them. ‘The man whom I kiss,’ he had said, ‘will be the one; arrest him.’
040	MAT	026	049	So he went up to Jesus at once, and exclaimed, ‘Welcome, Rabbi!’ and kissed him;
040	MAT	026	050	at which Jesus said to him, ‘Friend, do what you have come for.’ The men went up, seized Jesus, and arrested him.
040	MAT	026	051	Suddenly one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and striking the high priest’s servant, cut off his ear.
040	MAT	026	052	‘Sheathe your sword,’ Jesus said, ‘for all who draw the sword will be put to the sword.
040	MAT	026	053	Do you think that I cannot ask my Father for help, when he would at once send to my aid more than twelve legions of angels?
040	MAT	026	054	But in that case how would the scriptures be fulfilled, which say that this must be?’
040	MAT	026	055	Jesus at the same time said to the crowds, ‘Have you come out, as if after a robber, with swords and clubs, to take me? I have sat teaching day after day in the Temple Courts, and yet you did not arrest me.’
040	MAT	026	056	The whole of this occurred in fulfilment of the prophetic scriptures. Then the disciples all forsook him and fled.
040	MAT	026	057	Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the teachers of the Law and elders had assembled.
040	MAT	026	058	Peter followed him at a distance as far as the high priest’s courtyard, to see the outcome.
040	MAT	026	059	Meanwhile the chief priests and the whole of the High Council were trying to get such false evidence against Jesus, as would warrant putting him to death,
040	MAT	026	060	but they did not find any, although many came forward with false evidence. Later on, however, two men came forward and said,
040	MAT	026	061	‘This man said “I am able to destroy the Temple of God, and to build it in three days.”’
040	MAT	026	062	Then the high priest stood up, and said to Jesus, ‘Have you no answer? What is this evidence which these men are giving against you?’
040	MAT	026	063	But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, ‘I order you, by the living God, to tell us whether you are the Christ, the Son of God.’
040	MAT	026	064	‘It is true,’ Jesus answered, ‘Moreover I tell you all that hereafter you will see the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of the Almighty, and coming on the clouds of the heavens.’
040	MAT	026	065	Then the high priest tore his robes. ‘This is blasphemy!’ he exclaimed. ‘Why do we want any more witnesses? You have just heard his blasphemy!
040	MAT	026	066	What is your decision?’ They answered, ‘He deserves death.’
040	MAT	026	067	Then they spat in his face, and struck him, while others dealt blows at him, saying as they did so,
040	MAT	026	068	‘Now play the prophet for us, you Christ! Who was it that struck you?’
040	MAT	026	069	Peter, meanwhile, was sitting outside in the courtyard; and a maidservant came up to him, and exclaimed, ‘Why, you were with Jesus the Galilean!’
040	MAT	026	070	But Peter denied it before them all. ‘I do not know what you mean,’ he replied.
040	MAT	026	071	When he had gone out into the gateway, another maid saw him, and said to those who were there, ‘This man was with Jesus of Nazareth!’
040	MAT	026	072	Again he denied it with an oath, ‘I do not know the man!’
040	MAT	026	073	But soon afterwards those who were standing by came up and said to Peter, ‘You also are certainly one of them; why, even your way of speaking proves it!’
040	MAT	026	074	Then Peter said, ‘I swear that I do not know the man! May God punish me if I am lying!’ At that moment a cock crowed;
040	MAT	026	075	and Peter remembered the words which Jesus had said – “Before a cock has crowed, you will disown me three times”; and he went outside, and wept bitterly.
040	MAT	027	001	At daybreak all the chief priests and the elders of the people consulted together against Jesus, to bring about his death.
040	MAT	027	002	They put him in chains and led him away, and gave him up to the Roman Governor, Pilate.
040	MAT	027	003	Then Judas, who betrayed him, seeing that Jesus was condemned, repented of what he had done, and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders.
040	MAT	027	004	‘I did wrong in betraying a good man to his death,’ he said. ‘What has that to do with us?’ they replied. ‘You must see to that yourself.’
040	MAT	027	005	Judas flung down the pieces of silver in the Temple, and left; and went away and hanged himself.
040	MAT	027	006	The chief priests took the pieces of silver, but they said, ‘We must not put them into the Temple treasury, because they are blood-money.’
040	MAT	027	007	So, after consultation, they used it to buy the “Potter’s Field” as a burial ground for foreigners,
040	MAT	027	008	and that is why that field is called the “Field of Blood” to this very day.
040	MAT	027	009	Then it was that these words spoken by the prophet Jeremiah were fulfilled – “They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price set on him by the people of Israel,
040	MAT	027	010	and gave them for the potter’s field, as the Lord commanded me.”
040	MAT	027	011	Meanwhile Jesus was brought before the Roman Governor. ‘Are you the king of the Jews?’ asked the Governor. ‘It is true,’ answered Jesus.
040	MAT	027	012	While charges were being brought against him by the chief priests and elders, Jesus made no reply.
040	MAT	027	013	Then Pilate said to him, ‘Don’t you hear how many accusations they are making against you?’
040	MAT	027	014	Yet Jesus made no reply – not even a single word; at which the Governor was greatly astonished.
040	MAT	027	015	Now, at the feast, the Governor was accustomed to grant the people the release of any one prisoner whom they might choose.
040	MAT	027	016	At that time they had a notorious prisoner called Barabbas.
040	MAT	027	017	So, when the people had collected, Pilate said to them, ‘Which do you wish me to release for you? Barabbas? Or Jesus who is called “Christ”?’
040	MAT	027	018	For he knew that it was out of jealousy that they had given Jesus up to him.
040	MAT	027	019	While he was still on the Bench, his wife sent this message to him – ‘Do not have anything to do with that good man, for I have been very much troubled today in a dream because of him.’
040	MAT	027	020	But the chief priests and elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas, and to kill Jesus.
040	MAT	027	021	The Governor, however, said to them, ‘Which of these two do you wish me to release for you?’ ‘Barabbas,’ they answered.
040	MAT	027	022	‘What then,’ Pilate asked, ‘should I do with Jesus who is called “Christ?”’ ‘Crucify him,’ they all replied.
040	MAT	027	023	‘Why, what harm has he done?’ he asked. But they kept shouting furiously, ‘Crucify him!’
040	MAT	027	024	When Pilate saw that his efforts were unavailing, but that, on the contrary, a riot was beginning, he took some water, and washed his hands in the sight of the crowd, saying as he did so, ‘I am not answerable for this bloodshed; you must see to it yourselves.’
040	MAT	027	025	And all the people answered, ‘His blood be on our heads and on our children’s!’
040	MAT	027	026	Then Pilate released Barabbas to them, but Jesus he had scourged, and gave him up to be crucified.
040	MAT	027	027	After that, the Governor’s soldiers took Jesus with them into the Government house, and gathered the whole garrison round him.
040	MAT	027	028	They stripped him, and put on him a red military cloak,
040	MAT	027	029	and having twisted some thorns into a crown, put it on his head, and a rod in his right hand, and then, going down on their knees before him, they mocked him. ‘Long life to you, king of the Jews!’ they said.
040	MAT	027	030	They spat at him and, taking the rod, kept striking him on the head;
040	MAT	027	031	and, when they had left off mocking him, they took off the military cloak, and put his own clothes on him, and led him away to be crucified.
040	MAT	027	032	As they were on their way out, they came upon a man from Cyrene called Simon, and they compelled him to go with them to carry the cross.
040	MAT	027	033	On reaching a place named Golgotha (a place named from its likeness to a skull),
040	MAT	027	034	they gave him some wine to drink which had been mixed with gall; but after tasting it, Jesus refused to drink it.
040	MAT	027	035	When they had crucified him, they divided his clothes among them by casting lots.
040	MAT	027	036	Then they sat down, and kept watch over him there.
040	MAT	027	037	Above his head they fixed the accusation against him written out – “THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.”
040	MAT	027	038	At the same time two robbers were crucified with him, one on the right, the other on the left.
040	MAT	027	039	The passers-by railed at him, shaking their heads as they said,
040	MAT	027	040	‘You who would “destroy the Temple and build one in three days,” save yourself! If you are God’s Son, come down from the cross!’
040	MAT	027	041	In the same way the chief priests, with the Teachers of the Law and elders, said in mockery,
040	MAT	027	042	‘He saved others, but he cannot save himself! He is the “king of Israel”! Why doesn’t he come down from the cross now, then we will believe in him.
040	MAT	027	043	He has trusted in God; if God wants him, let him deliver him now; for he said “I am God’s Son.”’
040	MAT	027	044	Even the robbers, who were crucified with him, insulted him in the same way.
040	MAT	027	045	After midday a darkness came over all the country, lasting until three in the afternoon.
040	MAT	027	046	About three Jesus called out loudly, ‘Eloi, Eloi, lema sabacthani’ – that is to say, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”
040	MAT	027	047	Some of those standing by heard this, and said, ‘The man is calling for Elijah!’
040	MAT	027	048	One of them immediately ran and took a sponge, and, filling it with common wine, put it on the end of a rod, and offered it to him to drink.
040	MAT	027	049	But the rest said, ‘Wait and let us see if Elijah is coming to save him.’
040	MAT	027	050	But Jesus, uttering another loud cry, gave up his spirit.
040	MAT	027	051	Suddenly the Temple curtain was torn in two from top to bottom, the earth shook, the rocks were torn asunder,
040	MAT	027	052	the tombs opened, and the bodies of many of God’s people who had fallen asleep rose,
040	MAT	027	053	and they, leaving their tombs, went, after the resurrection of Jesus, into the Holy City, and appeared to many people.
040	MAT	027	054	The Roman centurion, and the men with him who were watching Jesus, on seeing the earthquake and all that was happening, became greatly frightened and exclaimed, ‘This must indeed have been God’s Son!’
040	MAT	027	055	There were many women there, watching from a distance, who had accompanied Jesus from Galilee and had been attending on him.
040	MAT	027	056	Among them were Mary of Magdala, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of Zebedee’s sons.
040	MAT	027	057	When evening had fallen, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who had himself become a disciple of Jesus.
040	MAT	027	058	He went to see Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus. Pilate ordered it to be given him.
040	MAT	027	059	So Joseph took the body, and wrapped it in a clean linen sheet,
040	MAT	027	060	and laid it in his newly made tomb which he had cut in the rock; and, before he left, he rolled a great stone against the entrance of the tomb.
040	MAT	027	061	Mary of Magdala and the other Mary remained behind, sitting in front of the grave.
040	MAT	027	062	The next day – that is, the day following the Preparation-day – the chief priests and Pharisees came in a body to Pilate, and said,
040	MAT	027	063	‘Sir, we remember that, during his lifetime, that impostor said “I will rise after three days.”
040	MAT	027	064	So order the tomb to be made secure until the third day. Otherwise his disciples may come and steal him, and then say to the people “He has risen from the dead,” when the latest imposture will be worse than the first.’
040	MAT	027	065	‘You may have a guard,’ was Pilate’s reply. ‘Go and make the tomb as secure as you can.’
040	MAT	027	066	So they went and made the tomb secure, by sealing the stone, in presence of the guard.
040	MAT	028	001	After the Sabbath, as the first day of the week began to dawn, Mary of Magdala and the other Mary had gone to look at the grave,
040	MAT	028	002	when suddenly a great earthquake occurred. For an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled away the stone, and seated himself on it.
040	MAT	028	003	His appearance was as dazzling as lightning, and his clothing was as white as snow;
040	MAT	028	004	and, in their terror of him, the men on guard trembled violently and became like dead men.
040	MAT	028	005	But the angel, addressing the women, said, ‘You need not be afraid. I know that it is Jesus, who was crucified, for whom you are looking.
040	MAT	028	006	He is not here; for he has risen, as he said he would. Come, and see the place where he was lying;
040	MAT	028	007	and then go quickly and say to his disciples “He has risen from the dead, and is going before you into Galilee; there you will see him.” Remember, I have told you.’
040	MAT	028	008	They left the tomb quickly, in awe and great joy, and ran to tell the news to the disciples.
040	MAT	028	009	Suddenly Jesus met them. ‘Welcome!’ he said. The women went up to him, and clasped his feet, bowing to the ground before him. Then Jesus said to them,
040	MAT	028	010	‘Do not be afraid; go and tell my brothers and sisters to set out for Galilee, and they will see me there.’
040	MAT	028	011	While they were still on their way, some of the guard came into the city, and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.
040	MAT	028	012	So they and the elders met and, after holding a consultation, gave a large sum of money to the soldiers,
040	MAT	028	013	and told them to say that his disciples came in the night, and stole him while they were asleep;
040	MAT	028	014	‘And should this matter come before the Governor,’ they added, ‘we will satisfy him, and see that you have nothing to fear.’
040	MAT	028	015	So the soldiers took the money, and did as they were instructed. This story spread widely; the people of Judea still tell it today.
040	MAT	028	016	The eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus told them to meet him;
040	MAT	028	017	and, when they saw him, they bowed to the ground before him; although some felt doubtful.
040	MAT	028	018	Then Jesus came up, and spoke to them, saying, ‘All authority in heaven and on the earth has been given to me.
040	MAT	028	019	Therefore go and make disciples of all the nations, baptising them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,
040	MAT	028	020	and teaching them to lay to heart all the commands that I have given you; and, remember, I myself am with you every day until the close of the age.’

# BOOK	041	MAR	Mark	Mark
041	MAR	001	001	The beginning of the good news about Jesus Christ.
041	MAR	001	002	It is said in the prophet Isaiah – “I am sending my messenger ahead of you; he will prepare your way.
041	MAR	001	003	The voice of one crying aloud in the wilderness: ‘Prepare the road for the Lord, make a straight path for him.’”
041	MAR	001	004	John the Baptiser appeared in the wilderness, proclaiming a baptism on repentance, for the forgiveness of sins.
041	MAR	001	005	The whole of Judea, as well as all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, went out to him; and they were baptised by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.
041	MAR	001	006	John wore clothes made of camels’ hair, with a leather strap round his waist, and lived on locusts and wild honey;
041	MAR	001	007	and he proclaimed – ‘After me is coming someone more powerful than I am, and I am not fit even to stoop down and unfasten his sandals.
041	MAR	001	008	I have baptised you with water, but he will baptise you with the Holy Spirit.’
041	MAR	001	009	Now about that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee, and was baptised by John in the Jordan.
041	MAR	001	010	Just as he was coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens split open and the Spirit coming down to him like a dove,
041	MAR	001	011	and from the heavens came a voice – ‘You are my dearly loved son; you bring me great joy.’
041	MAR	001	012	Immediately afterwards the Spirit drove Jesus out into the wilderness;
041	MAR	001	013	and he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted by Satan, and among the wild beasts, while the angels helped him.
041	MAR	001	014	After John had been arrested, Jesus went to Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God –
041	MAR	001	015	‘The time has come, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent, and believe the good news.’
041	MAR	001	016	As Jesus was going along the shore of the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net in the sea, for they were fishermen.
041	MAR	001	017	‘Come and follow me,’ Jesus said, ‘and I will teach you to fish for people.’
041	MAR	001	018	They left their nets at once, and followed him.
041	MAR	001	019	Going on a little further, he saw James, Zebedee’s son, and his brother John, who were in their boat mending the nets.
041	MAR	001	020	Jesus called them at once, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the crew, and went after him.
041	MAR	001	021	They walked to Capernaum. On the next Sabbath Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach.
041	MAR	001	022	The people were amazed at his teaching, for he taught them like one who had authority, and not like the teachers of the Law.
041	MAR	001	023	Now there was in their synagogue at the time a man under the power of a foul spirit, who called out,
041	MAR	001	024	‘What do you want with us, Jesus the Nazarene? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are – the Holy One of God!’
041	MAR	001	025	But Jesus rebuked the spirit, ‘Be silent! Come out from him.’
041	MAR	001	026	The foul spirit threw the man into a fit, and with a loud cry came out from him.
041	MAR	001	027	They were all so amazed that they kept asking each other, ‘What is this? What is this, a new kind of teaching? He gives his commands with authority even to the foul spirits, and they obey him!’
041	MAR	001	028	His fame spread at once in all directions, through the whole region of Galilee.
041	MAR	001	029	As soon as they had left the synagogue, they went to the house of Simon and Andrew, along with James and John.
041	MAR	001	030	Now Simon’s mother-in-law was lying ill with a fever, and they at once told Jesus about her.
041	MAR	001	031	Jesus went up to her and, grasping her hand, raised her up; the fever left her, and she began to take care of them.
041	MAR	001	032	In the evening, after sunset, the people brought to Jesus all who were ill or possessed by demons;
041	MAR	001	033	and the whole city was gathered round the door.
041	MAR	001	034	Jesus cured many who were ill with various diseases, and drove out many demons, and would not permit them to speak, because they knew him to be the Christ.
041	MAR	001	035	In the morning, long before daylight, Jesus got up and went out to a lonely spot, where he began to pray.
041	MAR	001	036	But Simon and his companions went out searching for him;
041	MAR	001	037	and, when they found him, they exclaimed, ‘Everyone is looking for you!’
041	MAR	001	038	But Jesus said to them, ‘Let us go somewhere else, into the country towns nearby so that I can make my proclamation in them also; for that was why I came.’
041	MAR	001	039	And he went about making his proclamation in their synagogues all through Galilee, and driving out the demons.
041	MAR	001	040	One day a leper came to Jesus and, falling on his knees, begged him for help. ‘If only you are willing,’ he said, ‘you are able to make me clean.’
041	MAR	001	041	Moved with compassion, Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, saying as he did so, ‘I am willing; become clean.’
041	MAR	001	042	Instantly the leprosy left the man, and he became clean;
041	MAR	001	043	and then Jesus, after sternly warning him, immediately sent him away,
041	MAR	001	044	and said to him, ‘Be careful not to say anything to anyone; but go and show yourself to the priest, and make the offerings for your cleansing directed by Moses, as evidence of your cure.’
041	MAR	001	045	The man, however, went away, and began to speak about it publicly, and to spread the story so widely, that Jesus could no longer go openly into a town, but stayed outside in lonely places; and people came to him from every direction.
041	MAR	002	001	Some days later, when Jesus came back to Capernaum, the news spread that he was in a house there;
041	MAR	002	002	and so many people collected together, that after a while there was no room for them even round the door; and he began to tell them his message.
041	MAR	002	003	Some people came, bringing to him a paralysed man, who was being carried by four of them.
041	MAR	002	004	They were unable to get him near to Jesus, because of the crowd, so they removed the roof above Jesus, and, when they had made an opening, they let down the mat on which the paralysed man was lying.
041	MAR	002	005	When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the man, ‘Child, your sins are forgiven.’
041	MAR	002	006	But some of the teachers of the Law who were sitting there were debating in their minds,
041	MAR	002	007	‘Why does this man speak like this? He is blaspheming! Who can forgive sins except God?’
041	MAR	002	008	Jesus, at once intuitively aware that they were debating with themselves in this way, said to them, ‘Why are you debating in your minds about this?
041	MAR	002	009	Which is easier? – to say to the paralysed man, “Your sins are forgiven”? Or to say “Get up, and take up your mat, and walk”?
041	MAR	002	010	But so you may know that the Son of Man has power to forgive sins on earth’ – here he said to the paralysed man –
041	MAR	002	011	‘To you I say, Get up, take up your mat, and return to your home.’
041	MAR	002	012	The man got up, and immediately took up his mat, and went out before them all; at which they were amazed, and, as they praised God, they said, ‘We have never seen anything like this!’
041	MAR	002	013	Jesus went out again to the sea; and all the people came to him, and he taught them.
041	MAR	002	014	As he went along, he saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus, sitting in the tax office, and said to him, ‘Follow me.’ Levi got up and followed him.
041	MAR	002	015	Later on he was in his house having dinner, and a number of tax collectors and outcasts took their places at the table with Jesus and his disciples; for many of them were following him.
041	MAR	002	016	When the teachers of the Law belonging to the party of the Pharisees saw that he was eating in the company of such people, they said to his disciples, ‘Why does he eat with the tax collectors and outcasts?’
041	MAR	002	017	Hearing this, Jesus said, ‘It is not those who are healthy who need a doctor, but those who are ill. I did not come to call the religious, but the outcast.’
041	MAR	002	018	Now John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting, and people came and asked Jesus, ‘Why is it that John’s disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, while yours do not?’
041	MAR	002	019	Jesus answered, ‘Can the groom’s friends fast, while the groom is with them? As long as they have the groom with them, they cannot fast.
041	MAR	002	020	But the days will come, when the groom will be taken away from them, and they will fast then – when that day comes.’
041	MAR	002	021	‘No one ever sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; if they do, the patch tears away from it – the new from the old – and a worse tear is made.
041	MAR	002	022	And no one ever puts new wine into old wine-skins; if they do, the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the skins are lost. But new wine is put into fresh skins.’
041	MAR	002	023	One Sabbath, as Jesus was walking through the cornfields, his disciples began to pick the ears of wheat as they went along.
041	MAR	002	024	‘Look!’ the Pharisees said to him, ‘why are they doing what is not allowed on the Sabbath?’
041	MAR	002	025	‘Have you never read,’ answered Jesus, ‘what David did when he was in need and hungry, he and his companions –
041	MAR	002	026	how he went into the house of God, in the time of Abiathar the high priest, and ate the consecrated bread, which only the priests are allowed to eat, and gave some to his comrades as well?’
041	MAR	002	027	Then Jesus added, ‘The Sabbath was made for people, and not people for the Sabbath;
041	MAR	002	028	so the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath.’
041	MAR	003	001	On another occasion Jesus went in to a synagogue, where there was a man whose hand was withered.
041	MAR	003	002	And they watched Jesus closely, to see if he would cure the man on the Sabbath, so that they might have a charge to bring against him.
041	MAR	003	003	‘Stand out in the middle,’ Jesus said to the man with the withered hand;
041	MAR	003	004	and to the people he said, ‘Is it allowable to do good at the Sabbath – or harm? To save a life, or destroy it?’
041	MAR	003	005	As they remained silent, Jesus looked round at them in anger, grieving at the hardness of their hearts, and said to the man, ‘Stretch out your hand.’ The man stretched it out; and his hand had become sound.
041	MAR	003	006	Immediately on leaving the synagogue, the Pharisees and the Herodians united in laying a plot against Jesus, to put him to death.
041	MAR	003	007	Then Jesus went away with his disciples to the sea, followed by a great number of people from Galilee.
041	MAR	003	008	A great number, hearing of all that he was doing, came to him from Judea, from Jerusalem, from Edom, from beyond the Jordan, and from the country round Tyre and Sidon.
041	MAR	003	009	So Jesus told his disciples to keep a small boat close by, so that the crowd would not crush him.
041	MAR	003	010	For he had cured many of them, and so people kept crowding around him, so all who were sick might touch him.
041	MAR	003	011	The foul spirits, too, whenever they caught sight of him, flung themselves down before him, and screamed out, ‘You are the Son of God’!
041	MAR	003	012	But he repeatedly warned them not to make him known.
041	MAR	003	013	Jesus made his way up the hill, and called those whom he wished; and they went to him.
041	MAR	003	014	He appointed twelve – whom he also named “apostles” – so that they might be with him, and that he might send them out as his messengers, to preach,
041	MAR	003	015	and with power to drive out demons.
041	MAR	003	016	So he appointed the Twelve – Peter (which was the name that Jesus gave to Simon),
041	MAR	003	017	James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John (to whom he gave the name of Boanerges, which means the Thunderers),
041	MAR	003	018	Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot,
041	MAR	003	019	and Judas Iscariot, the man who betrayed him.
041	MAR	003	020	Jesus went into a house; and again a crowd collected, so that they were not even able to eat their food.
041	MAR	003	021	When his relatives heard of it, they went to take charge of him, for they said that he was out of his mind.
041	MAR	003	022	The teachers of the Law, who had come down from Jerusalem, said, ‘He has Beelzebul in him! He drives the demons out by the help of their chief.’
041	MAR	003	023	So Jesus called them to him, and answered them in parables, ‘How can Satan drive out Satan?
041	MAR	003	024	When a kingdom is divided against itself, it cannot last;
041	MAR	003	025	and when a household is divided against itself, it will not be able to last.
041	MAR	003	026	So, if Satan is in revolt against himself and is divided, he cannot last – his end has come!
041	MAR	003	027	‘No man who has broken into a strong man’s house can carry off his goods, without first tying him up; and not until then will he plunder his house.
041	MAR	003	028	I tell you that people will be forgiven everything – their sins, and all the slanders that they utter;
041	MAR	003	029	but whoever slanders the Holy Spirit remains unforgiven to the end; he has to answer for an enduring sin.’
041	MAR	003	030	This was said in reply to the charge that he had a foul spirit in him.
041	MAR	003	031	His mother and his brothers came, and stood outside, and sent to ask him to come to them.
041	MAR	003	032	There was a crowd sitting round Jesus, and some of them said to him, ‘Look, your mother and your brothers are outside, asking for you.’
041	MAR	003	033	‘Who is my mother? And my brothers?’ was his reply.
041	MAR	003	034	Then he looked around on the people sitting in a circle round him, and said, ‘Here are my mother and my brothers!
041	MAR	003	035	Whoever does the will of God is my brother and sister and mother.’
041	MAR	004	001	Jesus again began to teach by the sea; and, as an immense crowd was gathering round him, he got into a boat, and sat in it on the sea, while all the people were on the shore at the water’s edge.
041	MAR	004	002	Then he taught them many truths in parables; and in the course of his teaching he said to them:
041	MAR	004	003	‘Listen! The sower went out to sow;
041	MAR	004	004	and presently, as he was sowing, some of the seed fell along the path; and the birds came, and ate it up.
041	MAR	004	005	Some fell on rocky ground, where it had not much soil, and, because the soil wasn’t deep, sprang up at once;
041	MAR	004	006	but, when the sun rose, it was scorched, and, because their roots were not deep enough, withered away.
041	MAR	004	007	Some of the seed fell among brambles; but the brambles shot up and completely choked it, and it yielded no return.
041	MAR	004	008	Some fell into good soil, and, shooting up and growing, yielded a return, amounting to thirty, sixty, and even a hundred fold.’
041	MAR	004	009	And Jesus said, ‘Let anyone who has ears to hear with hear.’
041	MAR	004	010	Afterwards, when he was alone, his followers and the Twelve asked him about his parables;
041	MAR	004	011	and he said, ‘To you the hidden truth of the kingdom of God has been imparted; but to those who are outside it all teaching takes the form of parables so that –
041	MAR	004	012	“Though they have eyes, they may see without perceiving; and though they have ears, they may hear without understanding; otherwise some day they might turn and be forgiven.”’
041	MAR	004	013	‘You do not know the meaning of this parable?’ he went on, ‘Then how will you understand all the other parables?
041	MAR	004	014	The sower sows the message.
041	MAR	004	015	The people meant by the seed that falls along the path are these – where the message is sown, but, as soon as they have heard it, Satan immediately comes and carries away the message that has been sown in them.
041	MAR	004	016	So, too, those meant by the seed sown on the rocky places are the people who, when they have heard the message, at once accept it joyfully;
041	MAR	004	017	but, as they have no root, they stand only for a short time; and so, when trouble or persecution arises because of the message, they fall away at once.
041	MAR	004	018	Those meant by the seed sown among the brambles are different; they are the people who hear the message,
041	MAR	004	019	but the cares of life, and the glamour of wealth, and cravings for many other things come in and completely choke the message, so that it gives no return.
041	MAR	004	020	But the people meant by the seed sown on the good ground are those who hear the message, and welcome it, and yield a return, thirty, sixty, and even a hundred fold.’
041	MAR	004	021	Jesus said to them, ‘Is a lamp brought to be put under a basket or under the couch, instead of being put on the lamp-stand?
041	MAR	004	022	There is nothing hidden that will not come to light and nothing is concealed that will not be brought into the open.
041	MAR	004	023	Let all who have ears to hear with hear.
041	MAR	004	024	‘Take care what you listen to,’ said Jesus. ‘The standard you use will be used for you, and more will be added for you.
041	MAR	004	025	For, to those who have, more will be given; while, from those who have nothing, even what they have will be taken away.’
041	MAR	004	026	Jesus also said, ‘This is what the kingdom of God is like – like a man who has scattered seed on the ground,
041	MAR	004	027	and then sleeps by night and rises by day, while the seed is shooting up and growing – he knows not how.
041	MAR	004	028	The ground bears the crop of itself – first the blade, then the ear, and then the full grain in the ear;
041	MAR	004	029	but, as soon as the crop is ready, immediately he puts in the sickle because harvest has come.’
041	MAR	004	030	Jesus also said, ‘To what can we liken the kingdom of God?
041	MAR	004	031	By what can we illustrate it? Perhaps by the growth of a mustard seed. This seed, when sown in the ground, though it is smaller than all other seeds,
041	MAR	004	032	yet, when sown, shoots up, and becomes larger than any other herb, and puts out great branches, so that even the wild birds can roost in its shelter.’
041	MAR	004	033	With many such parables Jesus used to speak to the people of his message, as far as they were able to receive it;
041	MAR	004	034	and to them he never used to speak except in parables; but in private to his own disciples he explained everything.
041	MAR	004	035	In the evening of the same day, Jesus said to them, ‘Let us go across.’
041	MAR	004	036	So, leaving the crowd behind, they took him with them, just as he was, in the boat; and there were other boats with him.
041	MAR	004	037	A violent squall came on, and the waves kept dashing into the boat, so that the boat was actually filling.
041	MAR	004	038	Jesus was in the stern asleep on the cushion; and the disciples roused him and cried, ‘Teacher! Is it nothing to you that we are lost?’
041	MAR	004	039	Jesus rose and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, ‘Hush! Be still!’ Then the wind dropped, and a great calm followed.
041	MAR	004	040	‘Why are you so timid?’ he exclaimed. ‘Have you no faith yet?’
041	MAR	004	041	But they were struck with great awe, and said to one another, ‘Who can this be that even the wind and the sea obey him?’
041	MAR	005	001	They came to the other side of the sea – the region of the Gerasenes;
041	MAR	005	002	and, as soon as Jesus had got out of the boat, he met a man coming out of the tombs, who was under the power of a foul spirit,
041	MAR	005	003	and who made his home in the tombs. No one had ever been able to secure him, even with a chain;
041	MAR	005	004	for, though he had many times been left secured with fetters and chains, he had snapped the chains and broken the fetters to pieces, and no one could master him.
041	MAR	005	005	Night and day alike, he was continually shrieking in the tombs and among the hills, and cutting himself with stones.
041	MAR	005	006	Catching sight of Jesus from a distance, he ran and bowed to the ground before him,
041	MAR	005	007	shrieking out in a loud voice, ‘What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? For God’s sake do not torment me!’
041	MAR	005	008	For Jesus had said, ‘Come out from the man, you foul spirit.’
041	MAR	005	009	And he asked him, ‘What is your name?’ ‘My name,’ he said, ‘is Legion, for there are many of us;’
041	MAR	005	010	and he begged Jesus again and again not to send them away out of that country.
041	MAR	005	011	There was a large herd of pigs close by, feeding on the hillside;
041	MAR	005	012	and the spirits begged Jesus, ‘Send us into the pigs so that we can take possession of them.’
041	MAR	005	013	Jesus gave them leave. They came out, and entered into the pigs; and the herd – about two thousand in number – rushed down the steep slope into the sea and were drowned in the sea.
041	MAR	005	014	Then the men who tended them ran away, and carried the news to the town, and to the country round; and the people went to see what had happened.
041	MAR	005	015	When they came to Jesus, they found the possessed man sitting there, clothed and in his right mind – the man who had had the “Legion” in him – and they were awe-struck.
041	MAR	005	016	Then those who had seen it related to them all that had happened to the possessed man, as well as about the pigs;
041	MAR	005	017	so they began to beg Jesus to leave their region.
041	MAR	005	018	As Jesus was getting into the boat, the possessed man begged him to let him stay with him.
041	MAR	005	019	But Jesus refused. ‘Go back to your home, to your own people,’ he said, ‘and tell them of all that the Lord has done for you, and how he took pity on you.’
041	MAR	005	020	So the man went, and began to proclaim in the district of the Ten Towns all that Jesus had done for him; and everyone was amazed.
041	MAR	005	021	By the time Jesus had recrossed in the boat to the opposite shore, a great number of people had gathered to meet him, and were standing by the sea.
041	MAR	005	022	One of the leaders of the synagogue, whose name was Jairus, came and, as soon as he saw Jesus, threw himself at his feet and begged him repeatedly,
041	MAR	005	023	saying, ‘My little daughter is at death’s door. Please come and place your hands on her so that she may recover and live.’
041	MAR	005	024	So Jesus went with him. A great number of people followed Jesus, and kept pressing round him.
041	MAR	005	025	Meanwhile a woman who for twelve years had suffered from haemorrhage,
041	MAR	005	026	and undergone much at the hands of many doctors, (spending all she had without obtaining any relief, but, on the contrary, growing worse),
041	MAR	005	027	heard about Jesus, came behind in the crowd, and touched his cloak.
041	MAR	005	028	‘If I can only touch his clothes,’ she said, ‘I will get well!’
041	MAR	005	029	At once her bleeding stopped, and she felt in herself that she was cured of her affliction.
041	MAR	005	030	Jesus at once became aware of the power that had gone out from him, and, turning round in the crowd, he said, ‘Who touched my clothes?’
041	MAR	005	031	‘You see the people pressing round you,’ exclaimed his disciples, ‘and yet you say “Who touched me?”’
041	MAR	005	032	But Jesus looked about to see who had done it.
041	MAR	005	033	Then the woman, in fear and trembling, knowing what had happened to her, came and threw herself down before him, and told him the whole truth.
041	MAR	005	034	‘Daughter,’ he said, ‘your faith has delivered you. Go, and peace be with you; be free from your affliction.’
041	MAR	005	035	Before he had finished speaking, some people from the house of the synagogue leader came and said, ‘Your daughter is dead! Why should you trouble the teacher further?’
041	MAR	005	036	But Jesus, overhearing what they were saying, said to the synagogue leader, ‘Do not be afraid; only have faith.’
041	MAR	005	037	And he allowed no one to accompany him, except Peter, James, and John, the brother of James.
041	MAR	005	038	Presently they reached the leader’s house, where Jesus saw a scene of confusion – people weeping and wailing incessantly.
041	MAR	005	039	‘Why this confusion and weeping?’ he said on entering. ‘The little child is not dead; she is asleep.’
041	MAR	005	040	They began to laugh at him; but he sent them all out, and then, with the child’s father and mother and his companions, went into the room where she was lying.
041	MAR	005	041	Taking her hand, Jesus said to her, ‘Talitha, koum!’ – which means “little girl, I am speaking to you – Rise!”
041	MAR	005	042	The little girl stood up at once, and began to walk about; for she was twelve years old. And, as soon as they saw it, they were overwhelmed with amazement;
041	MAR	005	043	but Jesus repeatedly cautioned them not to let anyone know of it, and told them to give her something to eat.
041	MAR	006	001	On leaving that place, Jesus, followed by his disciples, went to his own part of the country.
041	MAR	006	002	When the Sabbath came, he began to teach in the synagogue; and the people, as they listened, were deeply impressed. ‘Where did he get this?’ they said, ‘and what is this wisdom that has been given him? And these miracles which he is doing?
041	MAR	006	003	Isn’t he the carpenter, the son of Mary, and the brother of James, and Joses, and Judas, and Simon? And aren’t his sisters, too, living here among us?’ This proved a hindrance to their believing in him;
041	MAR	006	004	at which Jesus said, ‘A prophet is not without honour, except in his home town, and among his own relatives, and in his own home.’
041	MAR	006	005	And he could not work any miracle there, beyond placing his hands on a few infirm persons, and curing them;
041	MAR	006	006	and he wondered at the want of faith shown by the people. Jesus went round the villages, one after another, teaching.
041	MAR	006	007	He called the Twelve to him, and began to send them out as his messengers, two and two, and gave them authority over foul spirits.
041	MAR	006	008	He instructed them to take nothing but a staff for the journey – not even bread, or a bag, or coins in their purse;
041	MAR	006	009	but they were to wear sandals, and not to put on a second coat.
041	MAR	006	010	‘Whenever you go to stay at a house,’ he said, ‘remain there until you leave that place;
041	MAR	006	011	and if a place does not welcome you, or listen to you, as you go out of it shake off the dust that is on the soles of your feet, as a protest against them.’
041	MAR	006	012	So they set out, and proclaimed the need of repentance.
041	MAR	006	013	They drove out many demons, and anointed with oil many who were infirm, and cured them.
041	MAR	006	014	Now King Herod heard of Jesus; for his name had become well known. People were saying – ‘John the Baptiser must have risen from the dead, and that is why these miraculous powers are active in him.’
041	MAR	006	015	Others again said – ‘He is Elijah,’ and others – ‘He is a prophet, like one of the great prophets.’
041	MAR	006	016	But when Herod heard of him, he said – ‘The man whom I beheaded – John – he must be risen!’
041	MAR	006	017	For Herod himself had sent and arrested John, and put him in prison, in chains, to please Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip, because Herod had married her.
041	MAR	006	018	For John had said to Herod – ‘You have no right to be living with your brother’s wife.’
041	MAR	006	019	So Herodias was incensed against John, and wanted to put him to death, but was unable to do so,
041	MAR	006	020	because Herod stood in fear of John, knowing him to be an upright and holy man, and protected him. He had listened to John, but still remained much perplexed, and yet he found pleasure in listening to him.
041	MAR	006	021	A suitable opportunity, however, occurred when Herod, on his birthday, gave a dinner to his high officials, and his generals, and the foremost men in Galilee.
041	MAR	006	022	When his daughter – that is, the daughter of Herodias – came in and danced, she delighted Herod and those who were dining with him. ‘Ask me for whatever you like,’ the king said to the girl, ‘and I will give it to you’;
041	MAR	006	023	and he swore to her that he would give her whatever she asked him – up to half his kingdom.
041	MAR	006	024	The girl went out, and said to her mother ‘What must I ask for?’ ‘The head of John the Baptiser,’ answered her mother.
041	MAR	006	025	So she went in as quickly as possible to the king, and made her request. ‘I want you,’ she said, ‘to give me at once, on a dish, the head of John the Baptist.’
041	MAR	006	026	The king was much distressed; yet, because of his oath and of the guests at his table, he did not like to refuse her.
041	MAR	006	027	He immediately dispatched one of his bodyguard, with orders to bring John’s head. The man went and beheaded John in the prison,
041	MAR	006	028	and, bringing his head on a dish, gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother.
041	MAR	006	029	When John’s disciples heard of it, they came and took his body away, and laid it in a tomb.
041	MAR	006	030	When the apostles came back to Jesus, they told him all that they had done and all that they had taught.
041	MAR	006	031	‘Come by yourselves privately to some lonely spot,’ he said, ‘and rest for a while’ – for there were so many people coming and going that they had not time even to eat.
041	MAR	006	032	So they set off privately in their boat for a lonely spot.
041	MAR	006	033	Many people saw them going, and recognised them, and from all the towns they flocked together to the place on foot, and got there before them.
041	MAR	006	034	On getting out of the boat, Jesus saw a great crowd, and his heart was moved at the sight of them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd; and he began to teach them many things.
041	MAR	006	035	When it grew late, his disciples came up to him, and said, ‘This is a lonely spot, and it is already late.
041	MAR	006	036	Send the people away, so that they may go to the farms and villages around and buy themselves something to eat.’
041	MAR	006	037	But Jesus answered, ‘It is for you to give them something to eat.’ ‘Are we to go and spend almost a year’s wages on bread,’ they asked, ‘to give them to eat?’
041	MAR	006	038	‘How many loaves have you?’ he asked, ‘Go, and see.’ When they had found out, they told him, ‘Five, and two fish.’
041	MAR	006	039	Jesus directed them to make all the people take their seats on the green grass, in parties;
041	MAR	006	040	and they sat down in groups – in hundreds, and in fifties.
041	MAR	006	041	Taking the five loaves and the two fish, Jesus looked up to heaven, and said the blessing; he broke the loaves into pieces, and gave them to his disciples for them to serve out to the people, and he divided the two fish also among them all.
041	MAR	006	042	Everyone had sufficient to eat;
041	MAR	006	043	and they picked up enough broken pieces to fill twelve baskets, as well as some of the fish.
041	MAR	006	044	The people who ate the bread were five thousand in number.
041	MAR	006	045	Immediately afterwards Jesus made his disciples get into the boat, and cross over in advance, in the direction of Bethsaida, while he himself was dismissing the crowd.
041	MAR	006	046	After he had taken leave of the people, he went away up the hill to pray.
041	MAR	006	047	When evening fell, the boat was out in the middle of the sea, and Jesus was on the shore alone.
041	MAR	006	048	Seeing them labouring at the oars – for the wind was against them – about three hours after midnight Jesus came towards them, walking on the water, intending to join them.
041	MAR	006	049	But, when they saw him walking on the water, they thought it was a ghost, and cried out;
041	MAR	006	050	for all of them saw him, and were terrified. But Jesus at once spoke to them. ‘Courage!’ he said, ‘it is I; do not be afraid!’
041	MAR	006	051	Then he got into the boat with them, and the wind dropped. The disciples were utterly amazed,
041	MAR	006	052	for they had not understood about the loaves, their minds being slow to learn.
041	MAR	006	053	When they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret, and moored the boat.
041	MAR	006	054	But they had no sooner left her than the people, recognising Jesus,
041	MAR	006	055	hurried over the whole countryside, and began to carry about on mats those who were ill, wherever they heard he was.
041	MAR	006	056	So wherever he went – to villages, or towns, or farms – they would lay their sick in the market-places, begging him to let them touch only the tassel of his cloak; and all who touched were made well.
041	MAR	007	001	One day the Pharisees and some of the teachers of the Law who had come from Jerusalem gathered round Jesus.
041	MAR	007	002	They had noticed that some of his disciples ate their food with their hands “defiled,” by which they meant unwashed.
041	MAR	007	003	(For the Pharisees, and indeed all strict Jews, will not eat without first scrupulously washing their hands, holding in this to the traditions of their ancestors.
041	MAR	007	004	When they come from market, they will not eat without first sprinkling themselves; and there are many other customs which they have inherited and hold to, such as the ceremonial washing of cups, and jugs, and copper pans).
041	MAR	007	005	So the Pharisees and the teachers of the Law asked Jesus this question – ‘How is it that your disciples do not follow the traditions of our ancestors, but eat their food with defiled hands?’
041	MAR	007	006	His answer was, ‘It was well said by Isaiah when he prophesied about you hypocrites in the words – “This is a people who honour me with their lips, while their hearts are far removed from me;
041	MAR	007	007	but vainly do they worship me, For they teach but human precepts.”
041	MAR	007	008	You neglect God’s commandments and hold to human traditions.
041	MAR	007	009	Wisely do you set aside God’s commandments,’ he exclaimed, ‘to keep your own traditions!
041	MAR	007	010	For while Moses said “Honour your father and your mother,” and “Let anyone who abuses their father or mother suffer death,”
041	MAR	007	011	you say “If a person says to their father or mother ‘Whatever of mine might have been of service to you is Corban’” (which means “Set apart for God”) –
041	MAR	007	012	why, then you do not allow them to do anything further for their father or mother!
041	MAR	007	013	In this way you nullify the words of God by your traditions, which you hand down; and you do many similar things.’
041	MAR	007	014	Then Jesus called the people to him again, and said, ‘Listen to me, all of you, and mark my words.
041	MAR	007	015	There is nothing external to a person, which by going into them can defile them; but the things that come out of a person are the things that defile them.’
041	MAR	007	017	When Jesus went indoors, away from the crowd, his disciples began questioning him about this saying.
041	MAR	007	018	‘What, do even you understand so little?’ exclaimed Jesus. ‘Don’t you see that there is nothing external to a person, which by going into a person, can defile them,
041	MAR	007	019	because it does not pass into his heart, but into his stomach, and is afterwards got rid of?’ – in saying this Jesus pronounced all food clean.
041	MAR	007	020	‘It is what comes out from a person,’ he added, ‘that defiles them,
041	MAR	007	021	for it is from within, out of the hearts of people, that there come evil thoughts – sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery,
041	MAR	007	022	greed, wickedness, deceit, indecency, envy, slander, haughtiness, folly;
041	MAR	007	023	all these wicked things come from within, and do defile a person.’
041	MAR	007	024	On leaving that place, Jesus went to the district of Tyre and Sidon. He went into a house, and did not wish anyone to know it, but could not escape notice.
041	MAR	007	025	For a woman, whose little daughter had a foul spirit in her, heard of him immediately, and came and threw herself at his feet –
041	MAR	007	026	the woman was a foreigner, from Syrian Phoenicia – and she begged him to drive the demon out of her daughter.
041	MAR	007	027	‘Let the children be satisfied first,’ answered Jesus. ‘For it is not fair to take the children’s food, and throw it to dogs.’
041	MAR	007	028	‘Yes, Master,’ she replied. ‘Even the dogs under the table do feed on the children’s crumbs.’
041	MAR	007	029	‘For saying that,’ he answered, ‘you may go. The demon has gone out of your daughter.’
041	MAR	007	030	The woman went home, and found the child lying on her bed, and the demon gone.
041	MAR	007	031	On returning from the district of Tyre, Jesus went, by way of Sidon, to the Sea of Galilee, across the district of the Ten Towns.
041	MAR	007	032	Some people brought to him a man who was deaf and almost dumb, and they begged Jesus to place his hand on him.
041	MAR	007	033	Jesus took him aside from the crowd quietly, put his fingers into the man’s ears, and touched his tongue with saliva.
041	MAR	007	034	Then, looking up to heaven, he sighed, and said to the man, ‘Ephphatha!’ which means “Be opened.”
041	MAR	007	035	The man’s ears were opened, the string of his tongue was freed, and he began to talk plainly.
041	MAR	007	036	Jesus insisted on their not telling anyone; but the more he insisted, the more perseveringly they made it known,
041	MAR	007	037	and a profound impression was made on the people. ‘He has done everything well!’ they exclaimed. ‘He makes even the deaf hear and the dumb speak!’
041	MAR	008	001	About that time, when there was again a great crowd of people who had nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples to him, and said,
041	MAR	008	002	‘My heart is moved at the sight of all these people, for they have already been with me three days and they have nothing to eat;
041	MAR	008	003	and if I send them away to their homes hungry, they will break down on the way; and some of them have come a long distance.’
041	MAR	008	004	‘Where will it be possible,’ his disciples answered, ‘to get sufficient bread for these people in this lonely place?’
041	MAR	008	005	‘How many loaves have you?’ he asked. ‘Seven,’ they answered.
041	MAR	008	006	Jesus told the crowd to sit down on the ground. Then he took the seven loaves, and, after saying the thanksgiving, broke them, and gave them to his disciples to serve out; and they served them out to the crowd.
041	MAR	008	007	They had also a few small fish; and, after he had said the blessing, he told the disciples to serve out these as well.
041	MAR	008	008	The people had sufficient to eat, and they picked up seven baskets full of the broken pieces that were left.
041	MAR	008	009	There were about four thousand people. Then Jesus dismissed them.
041	MAR	008	010	Immediately afterwards, getting into the boat with his disciples, Jesus went to the district of Dalmanutha.
041	MAR	008	011	Here the Pharisees came out, and began to argue with Jesus, asking him for some sign from the heavens, to test him.
041	MAR	008	012	Sighing deeply, Jesus said, ‘Why does this generation ask for a sign? I tell you, no sign will be given it.’
041	MAR	008	013	So he left them to themselves, and, getting into the boat again, went away to the opposite shore.
041	MAR	008	014	Now the disciples had forgotten to take any bread with them, one loaf being all that they had in the boat.
041	MAR	008	015	So Jesus gave them this warning. ‘Take care,’ he said, ‘beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.’
041	MAR	008	016	They began talking to one another about their being short of bread;
041	MAR	008	017	and, noticing this, Jesus said to them, ‘Why are you talking about your being short of bread? Don’t you yet see or understand? Are your minds still so slow of comprehension?
041	MAR	008	018	Though you have eyes, do you not see? And though you have ears, do you not hear? Don’t you remember,
041	MAR	008	019	when I broke up the five loaves for the five thousand, how many baskets of broken pieces you picked up?’ ‘Twelve,’ they said.
041	MAR	008	020	‘And when the seven for the four thousand, how many basketfuls of broken pieces did you pick up?’ ‘Seven,’ they said.
041	MAR	008	021	‘Don’t you understand now?’ he repeated.
041	MAR	008	022	They came to Bethsaida. There some people brought a blind man to Jesus, and begged him to touch him.
041	MAR	008	023	Taking the blind man’s hand, Jesus led him to the outskirts of the village, and, when he had put saliva on the man’s eyes, he placed his hands on him, and asked him, ‘Do you see anything?’
041	MAR	008	024	The man looked up, and said, ‘I see the people, for, as they walk about, they look to me like trees.’
041	MAR	008	025	Then Jesus again placed his hands on the man’s eyes; and the man saw clearly, his sight was restored, and he saw everything with perfect distinctness.
041	MAR	008	026	Jesus sent him to his home, and said, ‘Do not go even into the village.’
041	MAR	008	027	Afterwards Jesus and his disciples went into the villages round Caesarea Philippi; and on the way he asked his disciples this question – ‘Who do people say that I am?’
041	MAR	008	028	‘John the Baptist,’ they answered, ‘but others say Elijah, while others say one of the prophets.’
041	MAR	008	029	‘But you,’ he asked, ‘who do you say that I am?’ To this Peter replied, ‘You are the Christ.’
041	MAR	008	030	At which Jesus charged them not to say this about him to anyone.
041	MAR	008	031	Then he began to teach them that the Son of Man must undergo much suffering, and that he must be rejected by the elders, and the chief priests, and the teachers of the Law, and be put to death, and rise again after three days.
041	MAR	008	032	He said all this quite openly. But Peter took Jesus aside, and began to rebuke him.
041	MAR	008	033	Jesus, however, turning round and seeing his disciples, rebuked Peter. ‘Out of my sight, Satan!’ he exclaimed. ‘For you look at things, not as God does, but as people do.’
041	MAR	008	034	Calling the people and his disciples to him, Jesus said, ‘If anyone wishes to walk in my steps, they must renounce self, take up their cross, and follow me.
041	MAR	008	035	For whoever wishes to save their life will lose it, and whoever, for my sake and for the sake of the good news, will lose their life will save it.
041	MAR	008	036	What good is it to a person to gain the whole world and forfeit their life?
041	MAR	008	037	For what could a person give that is of equal value with their life?
041	MAR	008	038	Whoever is ashamed of me and of my teaching, in this unfaithful and wicked generation, of them will the Son of Man be ashamed, when he comes in his Father’s glory with the holy angels.’
041	MAR	009	001	‘I tell you,’ he added, ‘that some of those who are standing here will not know death until they have seen the kingdom of God come in power.’
041	MAR	009	002	Six days later, Jesus took with him Peter, James, and John, and led them up a high mountain alone by themselves. There his appearance was transformed before their eyes,
041	MAR	009	003	and his clothes became whiter than any launderer in the whole world could bleach them.
041	MAR	009	004	And Elijah appeared to them, in company with Moses; and they were talking with Jesus.
041	MAR	009	005	‘Rabbi,’ said Peter, interposing, ‘it is good to be here; let us make three tents, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.’
041	MAR	009	006	For he did not know what to say, because they were much afraid.
041	MAR	009	007	Then a cloud came down and enveloped them; and from the cloud there came a voice – ‘This is my dearly loved son; listen to him.’
041	MAR	009	008	And suddenly, on looking round, they saw that there was now no one with them but Jesus alone.
041	MAR	009	009	As they were going down the mountainside, Jesus cautioned them not to relate what they had seen to anyone, until after the Son of Man had risen from the dead.
041	MAR	009	010	They seized on these words and discussed with one another what this “rising from the dead” meant.
041	MAR	009	011	‘How is it,’ they asked Jesus, ‘that our teachers of the Law say that Elijah has to come first?’
041	MAR	009	012	‘Elijah does indeed come first,’ answered Jesus, ‘and re-establish everything; and does not scripture speak, with regard to the Son of Man, of his undergoing much suffering and being utterly despised?
041	MAR	009	013	But I tell you that Elijah has come, and people have treated him just as they pleased, as scripture says of him.’
041	MAR	009	014	When they came to the other disciples, they saw a great crowd round them, and some teachers of the Law arguing with them.
041	MAR	009	015	But, as soon as they saw Jesus, all the people, in great astonishment, ran up and greeted him.
041	MAR	009	016	‘What are you arguing about with them?’ Jesus asked.
041	MAR	009	017	‘Teacher,’ answered a man in the crowd, ‘I brought my son to see you, as he has a spirit in him that makes him mute;
041	MAR	009	018	and, wherever it seizes him, it dashes him down; he foams at the mouth and grinds his teeth, and he is pining away. I asked your disciples to drive the spirit out, but they failed.’
041	MAR	009	019	‘Faithless generation!’ exclaimed Jesus. ‘How long must I be with you? How long must I have patience with you? Bring the boy to me.’
041	MAR	009	020	They brought him to Jesus; but no sooner did the boy see him than the spirit threw him into convulsions; and he fell on the ground, and rolled about, foaming at the mouth.
041	MAR	009	021	‘How long has he been like this?’ Jesus asked the boy’s father.
041	MAR	009	022	‘From his childhood,’ he answered. ‘It has often thrown him into fire and into water to put an end to his life; but, if you can possibly do anything, take pity on us, and help us!’
041	MAR	009	023	‘Why say “possibly”?’ Jesus replied. ‘Everything is possible for one who has faith.’
041	MAR	009	024	The boy’s father immediately cried out, ‘I have faith; help my want of faith!’
041	MAR	009	025	But, when Jesus saw that a crowd was quickly collecting, he rebuked the foul spirit, ‘Deaf and dumb spirit, it is I who command you. Come out from him and never enter him again.’
041	MAR	009	026	With a loud cry the spirit threw the boy into repeated convulsions, and then came out from him. The boy looked like a corpse, so that most of them said that he was dead.
041	MAR	009	027	But Jesus took his hand, and lifted him; and he stood up.
041	MAR	009	028	When Jesus had gone indoors, his disciples asked him privately, ‘Why couldn’t we drive it out?’
041	MAR	009	029	‘A spirit of this kind,’ he said, ‘can be driven out only by prayer.’
041	MAR	009	030	Leaving that place, Jesus and his disciples went on their way through Galilee; but he did not wish anyone to know it,
041	MAR	009	031	for he was instructing his disciples, and telling them – ‘The Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of his fellow men, and they will put him to death, but, when he has been put to death, he will rise again after three days.’
041	MAR	009	032	But the disciples did not understand his meaning and were afraid to question him.
041	MAR	009	033	They came to Capernaum. When Jesus had gone into the house, he asked them, ‘What were you discussing on the way?’
041	MAR	009	034	But they were silent; for on the way they had been arguing with one another which was the greatest.
041	MAR	009	035	Sitting down, Jesus called the Twelve and said, ‘If anyone wishes to be first, he must be last of all, and servant of all.’
041	MAR	009	036	Then Jesus took a little child, and placed it in the middle of them. Taking it in his arms, he said to them,
041	MAR	009	037	‘Anyone who, for the sake of my name, welcomes even a little child like this is welcoming me, and anyone who welcomes me is welcoming not me, but him who sent me as his messenger.’
041	MAR	009	038	‘Teacher,’ said John, ‘we saw a man driving out demons by using your name, and we tried to prevent him, because he did not follow us.’
041	MAR	009	039	‘None of you must prevent the man,’ answered Jesus, ‘for no one will use my name in working a miracle, and yet find it easy to speak evil of me.
041	MAR	009	040	He who is not against us is for us.
041	MAR	009	041	If anyone gives you a cup of water because you belong to Christ, I tell you, he will assuredly not lose his reward.
041	MAR	009	042	‘And, if anyone puts temptation in the way of one of these little ones who believe in me, it would be far better for him if he had been thrown into the sea with a great millstone round his neck.
041	MAR	009	043	If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It would be better for you to enter life maimed, than to have both your hands and go into Gehenna, into the fire that cannot be put out.
041	MAR	009	045	If your foot causes you to sin, cut it off. It would be better for you to enter life lame, than to have both your feet and be thrown into Gehenna.
041	MAR	009	047	If your eye causes you to sin, tear it out. It would be better for you to enter the kingdom of God with only one eye, than to have both eyes and be thrown into Gehenna,
041	MAR	009	048	where their worm does not die, and the fire is not put out.
041	MAR	009	049	For it is by fire that everyone will be salted.
041	MAR	009	050	Salt is good, but, if the salt should lose its saltiness, what will you use to season it? You must have salt in yourselves, and live at peace with one another.’
041	MAR	010	001	On leaving that place, Jesus went into the district of Judea on the other side of the Jordan. Crowds gathered about him again; and again, as usual, he began teaching them.
041	MAR	010	002	Presently some Pharisees came up and, to test him, asked, ‘Has a husband the right to divorce his wife?’
041	MAR	010	003	‘What direction did Moses give you?’ replied Jesus.
041	MAR	010	004	‘Moses,’ they said, ‘permitted a man to draw up in writing a notice of separation and divorce his wife.’
041	MAR	010	005	‘It was owing to the hardness of your hearts,’ said Jesus, ‘that Moses gave you this direction;
041	MAR	010	006	but, at the beginning of the Creation, “God made them male and female.”
041	MAR	010	007	“For this reason a man will leave his father and mother,
041	MAR	010	008	and the man and his wife will become one;” so that they are no longer two, but one.
041	MAR	010	009	What God himself, then, has yoked together no one must separate.’
041	MAR	010	010	When they were indoors, the disciples asked him again about this,
041	MAR	010	011	and he said, ‘Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman is guilty of adultery against his wife;
041	MAR	010	012	and, if the woman divorces her husband and marries another man, she is guilty of adultery.’
041	MAR	010	013	Some of the people were bringing little children to Jesus, for him to touch them; but the disciples rebuked those who had brought them.
041	MAR	010	014	When, however, Jesus saw this, he was indignant. ‘Let the little children come to me,’ he said, ‘do not hinder them; for it is to the childlike that the kingdom of God belongs.
041	MAR	010	015	I tell you, unless a person receives the kingdom of God like a child, they will not enter it at all.’
041	MAR	010	016	Then he embraced the children, and, placing his hands on them, gave them his blessing.
041	MAR	010	017	As Jesus was resuming his journey, a man came running up to him, and threw himself on his knees before him. ‘Good teacher,’ he asked, ‘what must I do to gain eternal life?’
041	MAR	010	018	‘Why do you call me good?’ answered Jesus. ‘No one is good but God.
041	MAR	010	019	You know the commandments – “Do not kill. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not say what is false about others. Do not cheat. Honour your father and your mother.”’
041	MAR	010	020	‘Teacher,’ he replied, ‘I have observed all these from my childhood.’
041	MAR	010	021	Jesus looked at the man, and his heart went out to him, and he said, ‘There is still one thing wanting in you; go and sell all that you have, and give to the poor, and you will have wealth in heaven; then come and follow me.’
041	MAR	010	022	But the man’s face clouded at these words, and he went away distressed, for he had great possessions.
041	MAR	010	023	Then Jesus looked round, and said to his disciples, ‘How hard it will be for people of wealth to enter the kingdom of God!’
041	MAR	010	024	The disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said again, ‘My children, how hard a thing it is to enter the kingdom of God!
041	MAR	010	025	It is easier for a camel to get through a needle’s eye, than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.’
041	MAR	010	026	‘Then who can be saved?’ they exclaimed in the greatest astonishment.
041	MAR	010	027	Jesus looked at them, and answered, ‘With people it is impossible, but not with God; for everything is possible with God.’
041	MAR	010	028	‘But we,’ began Peter, ‘we left everything and have followed you.’
041	MAR	010	029	‘I tell you,’ said Jesus, ‘there is no one who has left house, or brothers, or sisters, or mother, or father, or children, or land, for my sake and for the good news,
041	MAR	010	030	who will not receive a hundred times as much, even now in the present – houses, and brothers, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and land, though not without persecutions – and in the age that is coming, eternal life.
041	MAR	010	031	But many who are first now will then be last, and the last will be first.’
041	MAR	010	032	They were on the road going up to Jerusalem, with Jesus walking in front of them. The disciples were filled with awe, while those who were following behind were overwhelmed with fear. Gathering the Twelve round him once more, Jesus began to tell them what was about to happen to him.
041	MAR	010	033	‘Listen!’ he said. ‘We are going up to Jerusalem; and there the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and the teachers of the Law, and they will condemn him to death, and they will give him up to the Gentiles,
041	MAR	010	034	who will mock him, spit on him, and scourge him, and put him to death; and after three days he will rise again.’
041	MAR	010	035	James and John, the two sons of Zebedee, went to Jesus, and said, ‘Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask.’
041	MAR	010	036	‘What do you want me to do for you?’ he asked.
041	MAR	010	037	‘Grant us this,’ they answered, ‘to sit, one on your right, and the other on your left, when you come in glory.’
041	MAR	010	038	‘You do not know what you are asking,’ Jesus said to them. ‘Can you drink the cup that I am to drink? Or receive the baptism that I am to receive?’
041	MAR	010	039	‘Yes,’ they answered, ‘we can.’ ‘You will indeed drink the cup that I am to drink,’ Jesus said, ‘and receive the baptism that I am to receive,
041	MAR	010	040	but as to a seat at my right or at my left – that is not mine to give, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared.’
041	MAR	010	041	On hearing of this, the ten others were at first very indignant about James and John.
041	MAR	010	042	But Jesus called the ten to him, and said, ‘Those who are regarded as ruling among the Gentiles lord it over them, as you know, and their great men oppress them.
041	MAR	010	043	But among you it is not so. No, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant,
041	MAR	010	044	and whoever wants to take the first place among you must be the servant of all;
041	MAR	010	045	for even the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.’
041	MAR	010	046	They came to Jericho. When Jesus was going out of the town with his disciples and a large crowd, Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, a blind beggar, was sitting by the roadside.
041	MAR	010	047	Hearing that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to call out, ‘Jesus, Son of David, take pity on me.’
041	MAR	010	048	Many of the people kept telling him to be quiet; but the man continued to call out all the louder, ‘Son of David, take pity on me.’
041	MAR	010	049	Then Jesus stopped. ‘Call him,’ he said. So they called the blind man. ‘Have courage!’ they exclaimed. ‘Get up; he is calling you.’
041	MAR	010	050	The man threw off his cloak, sprang up, and came to Jesus.
041	MAR	010	051	‘What do you want me to do for you?’ said Jesus, addressing him. ‘Rabboni,’ the blind man answered, ‘I want to recover my sight.’
041	MAR	010	052	‘You may go,’ Jesus said, ‘Your faith has delivered you.’ Immediately he recovered his sight, and began to follow Jesus along the road.
041	MAR	011	001	When they had almost reached Jerusalem, as far as Bethphage and Bethany, near the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent on two of his disciples.
041	MAR	011	002	‘Go to the village facing you,’ he said, ‘and, as soon as you get there, you will find a foal tethered, which no one has ever ridden; untie it, and bring it.
041	MAR	011	003	And, if anyone says to you “Why are you doing that?”, say “The Master wants it, and will be sure to send it back here at once.”’
041	MAR	011	004	The two disciples went, and, finding a foal tethered outside a door in the street, they untied it.
041	MAR	011	005	Some of the bystanders said to them, ‘What are you doing, untying the foal?’
041	MAR	011	006	And the two disciples answered as Jesus had told them; and they allowed them to go.
041	MAR	011	007	Then they brought the foal to Jesus, and, when they had laid their cloaks on it, he seated himself on it.
041	MAR	011	008	Many of the people spread their cloaks on the road, while some strewed boughs which they had cut from the fields;
041	MAR	011	009	and those who led the way, as well as those who followed, kept shouting, ‘God save him! Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!
041	MAR	011	010	Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David! God save him from on high!’
041	MAR	011	011	Jesus entered Jerusalem, and went into the Temple Courts; and, after looking round at everything, as it was already late, he went out to Bethany with the Twelve.
041	MAR	011	012	The next day, after they had left Bethany, Jesus became hungry;
041	MAR	011	013	and, noticing a fig tree at a distance in leaf, he went to it to see if by any chance he could find something on it; but, on coming up to it, he found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs.
041	MAR	011	014	So, addressing the tree, he exclaimed, ‘May no one ever again eat of your fruit!’ And his disciples heard what he said.
041	MAR	011	015	They came to Jerusalem. Jesus went into the Temple Courts, and began to drive out those who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers, and the seats of the pigeon-dealers,
041	MAR	011	016	and would not allow anyone to carry anything across the Temple Courts.
041	MAR	011	017	Then he began to teach. ‘Does not scripture say,’ he asked, ‘“My house will be called a house of prayer for all the nations”? But you have made it a den of robbers.’
041	MAR	011	018	Now the chief priests and the teachers of the Law heard this and began to look for some way of putting Jesus to death; for they were afraid of him, since all the people were greatly impressed by his teaching.
041	MAR	011	019	As soon as evening fell, Jesus and his disciples went out of the city.
041	MAR	011	020	As they passed by early in the morning, they noticed that the fig tree was withered up from the roots.
041	MAR	011	021	Then Peter recalled what had occurred. ‘Look, Rabbi,’ he exclaimed, ‘the fig tree which you doomed is withered up!’
041	MAR	011	022	‘Have faith in God!’ replied Jesus.
041	MAR	011	023	‘I tell you that if anyone should say to this hill “Be lifted up and hurled into the sea!”, without ever a doubt in his mind, but in the faith that what he says will be done, he would find that it would be.
041	MAR	011	024	And therefore I say to you “Have faith that whatever you ask for in prayer is already granted you, and you will find that it will be.”
041	MAR	011	025	‘And, whenever you stand up to pray, forgive any grievance that you have against anyone, so that your Father who is in heaven also may forgive you your offences.’
041	MAR	011	027	They came to Jerusalem again. While Jesus was walking about in the Temple Courts, the chief priests, the teachers of the Law, and the elders came up to him.
041	MAR	011	028	‘What authority have you to do these things?’ they said. ‘Who gave you the authority to do them?’
041	MAR	011	029	‘I will put one question to you,’ said Jesus. ‘Answer me that, and then I will tell you what authority I have to act as I do.
041	MAR	011	030	It is about John’s baptism. Was it of divine or human origin? Answer me that.’
041	MAR	011	031	They began arguing together. ‘If we say “divine,” he will say “Why then didn’t you believe him?”
041	MAR	011	032	Yet can we say “human”?’ They were afraid of the people, for everyone regarded John as undoubtedly a prophet.
041	MAR	011	033	So their answer to Jesus was – ‘We do not know.’ ‘Then I,’ replied Jesus, ‘refuse to tell you what authority I have to do these things.’
041	MAR	012	001	Jesus began to speak to them in parables, ‘A man once planted a vineyard, put a fence round it, dug a wine-press, built a tower, and then let it out to tenants and went abroad.
041	MAR	012	002	At the proper time he sent a servant to the tenants, to receive from them a share of the produce of the grape harvest;
041	MAR	012	003	but they seized him, and beat him, and sent him away empty-handed.
041	MAR	012	004	A second time the owner sent a servant to them; this man, too, the tenants struck on the head, and insulted.
041	MAR	012	005	He sent another, but him they killed; and so with many others – some they beat and some they killed.
041	MAR	012	006	He had still one son, who was very dear to him; and him he sent to them last of all. “They will respect my son,” he said.
041	MAR	012	007	But those tenants said to one another “Here is the heir! Come, let us kill him, and his inheritance will be ours.”
041	MAR	012	008	So they seized him, and killed him, and threw his body outside the vineyard.
041	MAR	012	009	What will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and put the tenants to death, and he will let the vineyard to others.
041	MAR	012	010	‘Have you never read this passage of scripture? – “The stone which the builders despised has now itself become the cornerstone;
041	MAR	012	011	this cornerstone has come from the Lord, and is marvellous in our eyes.”’
041	MAR	012	012	After this his enemies were eager to arrest him, but they were afraid of the crowd; for they saw that it was at them that he had aimed the parable. So they left him alone, and went away.
041	MAR	012	013	Afterwards they sent to Jesus some of the Pharisees and Herodians, to set a trap for him in the course of conversation.
041	MAR	012	014	These men came to him and said, ‘Teacher, we know that you are an honest man, and are not afraid of anyone, for you pay no regard to a person’s position, but teach the way of God honestly; are we right in paying taxes to the Emperor, or not?
041	MAR	012	015	Should we pay, or should we not pay?’ Knowing their hypocrisy, Jesus said to them, ‘Why are you testing me? Bring me a coin to look at.’
041	MAR	012	016	And, when they had brought it, he asked, ‘Whose head and title are these?’ ‘The Emperor’s,’ they said;
041	MAR	012	017	and Jesus replied, ‘Pay to the Emperor what belongs to the Emperor, and to God what belongs to God.’ And they were amazed at him.
041	MAR	012	018	Next came some Sadducees – the men who maintain that there is no resurrection. Their question was this –
041	MAR	012	019	‘Teacher, in our scriptures Moses decreed that, should a man’s brother die, leaving a widow but no child, the man should take the widow as his wife, and raise up a family for his brother.
041	MAR	012	020	There were once seven brothers. The eldest married, but died and left no family;
041	MAR	012	021	and the second married his widow, and died without family; and so did the third.
041	MAR	012	022	All the seven died and left no family. The woman herself died last of all.
041	MAR	012	023	At the resurrection whose wife will she be, all seven brothers having had her as their wife?’
041	MAR	012	024	‘Is not the reason of your mistake,’ answered Jesus, ‘your ignorance of the scriptures and of the power of God?
041	MAR	012	025	When people rise from the dead, there is no marrying or being married; but they are as angels in heaven.
041	MAR	012	026	‘As to the dead, and the fact that they rise, have you never read in the book of Moses, in the passage about the Bush, how God spoke to him saying – “I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob”?
041	MAR	012	027	He is not God of dead people, but of living. You are greatly mistaken.’
041	MAR	012	028	Then came up one of the teachers of the Law who had heard their discussions. Knowing that Jesus had answered them wisely, he asked him this question, ‘Which commandment is the most important of all?’
041	MAR	012	029	‘The most important,’ answered Jesus, ‘is – “Hear, Israel; the Lord our God is the one Lord;
041	MAR	012	030	and you must love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength.”
041	MAR	012	031	The second is this – “You must love your neighbour as you love yourself.” There is no commandment greater than these.’
041	MAR	012	032	‘Wisely answered, teacher!’ exclaimed the teacher of the Law. ‘It is true, as you say, that there is one God, and that there is no other besides him;
041	MAR	012	033	and to love him with all one’s heart, and with all one’s understanding, and with all one’s strength, and to love one’s neighbour as one loves oneself is far beyond all burnt offerings and sacrifices.’
041	MAR	012	034	Seeing that he had answered with discernment, Jesus said to him, ‘You are not far from the kingdom of God.’ After that no one ventured to question him further.
041	MAR	012	035	While Jesus was teaching in the Temple Courts, he asked, ‘How is it that the teachers of the Law say that the Christ is to be David’s son?
041	MAR	012	036	David said himself, speaking under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit – “The Lord said to my lord: Sit at my right hand, until I put your enemies beneath your feet.”
041	MAR	012	037	David himself calls him “lord,” how comes it, then, that he is to be his son?’ The mass of the people listened to Jesus with delight.
041	MAR	012	038	In the course of his teaching, Jesus said, ‘See that you are on your guard against the teachers of the Law, who delight to walk about in long robes, and to be greeted in the streets with respect,
041	MAR	012	039	and to have the best seats in the synagogues, and places of honour at dinner.
041	MAR	012	040	They are the men who rob widows of their homes, and make a pretence of saying long prayers. Their sentence will be all the heavier.’
041	MAR	012	041	Then Jesus sat down opposite the chests for the Temple offerings, and watched how the people put money into them. Many rich people were putting in large sums;
041	MAR	012	042	but one poor widow came and put in two small coins, worth very little.
041	MAR	012	043	Then, calling his disciples to him, Jesus said, ‘I tell you that this poor widow has put in more than all the others who were putting money into the chests;
041	MAR	012	044	for everyone else put in something from what he had to spare, while she, in her need, put in all she had – everything that she had to live on.’
041	MAR	013	001	As Jesus was walking out of the Temple Courts, one of his disciples said to him, ‘Teacher, look what fine stones and buildings these are!’
041	MAR	013	002	‘Do you see these great buildings?’ asked Jesus. ‘Not a single stone will be left here on another, which will not be thrown down.’
041	MAR	013	003	When Jesus had sat down on the Mount of Olives, facing the Temple, Peter, James, John and Andrew questioned him privately,
041	MAR	013	004	‘Tell us when this will be, and what will be the sign when all this is drawing to its close.’
041	MAR	013	005	Then Jesus began, ‘See that no one leads you astray.
041	MAR	013	006	Many will take my name, and come saying “I am He”, and will lead many astray.
041	MAR	013	007	‘And, when you hear of wars and rumours of wars, do not be alarmed; such things must occur; but the end is not yet.
041	MAR	013	008	For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; there will be earthquakes in various places; there will be famines. This will be but the beginning of the birth-pangs.
041	MAR	013	009	‘See to yourselves! They will betray you to courts of law; and you will be taken to synagogues and beaten; and you will be brought up before governors and kings for my sake, so that you can bear witness before them.
041	MAR	013	010	But the good news must first be proclaimed to every nation.
041	MAR	013	011	Whenever they betray you and hand you over for trial, do not be anxious beforehand as to what you will say, but say whatever is given you at the moment; for it will not be you who speak, but the Holy Spirit.
041	MAR	013	012	Brother will betray brother to death, and the father his child; and children will turn against their parents, and cause them to be put to death;
041	MAR	013	013	and you will be hated by everyone because of me. Yet the person who endures to the end will be saved.
041	MAR	013	014	‘As soon, however, as you see “the Foul Desecration” standing where it ought not’ (the reader must consider what this means) ‘then those of you who are in Judea must take refuge in the mountains;
041	MAR	013	015	and a person on the house-top must not go down, or go in to get anything out of their house:
041	MAR	013	016	nor must one who is on their farm turn back to get their cloak.
041	MAR	013	017	And alas for pregnant women, and for those who are nursing infants in those days!
041	MAR	013	018	Pray, too, that this may not occur in winter.
041	MAR	013	019	For those days will be a time of distress, the like of which has not occurred from the beginning of God’s creation until now – and never will again.
041	MAR	013	020	And, had not the Lord put a limit to those days, not a single soul would escape; but, for the sake of God’s own chosen people, he did limit them.
041	MAR	013	021	‘And at that time if anyone should say to you “Look, here is the Christ!” “Look, there he is!”, do not believe it;
041	MAR	013	022	for false Christs and false prophets will arise, and display signs and marvels, to lead astray, were it possible, even God’s people.
041	MAR	013	023	But see that you are on your guard! I have told you all this beforehand.
041	MAR	013	024	‘In those days, after that time of distress, the sun will be darkened, the moon will not give her light,
041	MAR	013	025	the stars will be falling from the heavens, and the forces that are in the heavens will be convulsed.
041	MAR	013	026	Then will be seen the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory;
041	MAR	013	027	and then he will send the angels, and gather his people from the four winds, from one end of the world to the other.
041	MAR	013	028	‘Learn the lesson taught by the fig tree. As soon as its branches are full of sap, and it is bursting into leaf, you know that summer is near.
041	MAR	013	029	And so may you, as soon as you see these things happening, know that he is at your doors.
041	MAR	013	030	I tell you that even the present generation will not pass away, until all these things have taken place.
041	MAR	013	031	The heavens and the earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.
041	MAR	013	032	‘But about that day, or the hour, no one knows – not even the angels in heaven, not even the Son – but only the Father.
041	MAR	013	033	‘See that you are on the watch; for you do not know when the time will be.
041	MAR	013	034	It is like a man going on a journey, who leaves his home, puts his servants in charge – each having their special duty – and orders the porter to watch.
041	MAR	013	035	Therefore watch, for you cannot be sure when the Master of the house is coming – whether in the evening, at midnight, at daybreak, or in the morning –
041	MAR	013	036	otherwise he might come suddenly and find you asleep.
041	MAR	013	037	And what I say to you I say to all – Watch!’
041	MAR	014	001	It was now two days before the Festival of the Passover and the unleavened bread. The chief priests and the teachers of the Law were looking for an opportunity to arrest Jesus by stealth, and to put him to death;
041	MAR	014	002	for they said, ‘Not during the Festival, or the people may riot.’
041	MAR	014	003	When Jesus was still at Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, while he was sitting at the table, a woman came with an alabaster jar of choice spikenard perfume of great value. She broke the jar, and poured the perfume on his head.
041	MAR	014	004	Some of those who were present said to one another indignantly, ‘Why has the perfume been wasted like this?
041	MAR	014	005	This perfume could have been sold for more than a year’s wages, and the money given to the poor.’
041	MAR	014	006	‘Leave her alone,’ said Jesus, as they began to find fault with her, ‘why are you troubling her? This is a beautiful deed that she has done for me.
041	MAR	014	007	You always have the poor with you, and whenever you wish you can do good to them; but you will not always have me.
041	MAR	014	008	She has done what she could; she has perfumed my body beforehand for my burial.
041	MAR	014	009	And I tell you, wherever, in the whole world, the good news is proclaimed, what this woman has done will be told in memory of her.’
041	MAR	014	010	After this, Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve, went to the chief priests, to betray Jesus to them.
041	MAR	014	011	They were glad to hear what he said, and promised to pay him. So he began looking for a good opportunity to betray Jesus.
041	MAR	014	012	On the first day of the Festival of the unleavened bread, when it was customary to kill the Passover lambs, his disciples said to Jesus, ‘Where do you wish us to go and make preparations for your eating the Passover?’
041	MAR	014	013	Jesus sent forward two of his disciples and said to them, ‘Go into the city, and there a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you; follow him;
041	MAR	014	014	and, wherever he goes in, say to the owner of the house “The teacher says – Where is my room where I am to eat the Passover with my disciples?”
041	MAR	014	015	He will himself show you a large upstairs room, set out ready; and there make preparations for us.’
041	MAR	014	016	So the disciples set out and went into the city, and found everything just as Jesus had told them; and they prepared the Passover.
041	MAR	014	017	In the evening he went there with the Twelve,
041	MAR	014	018	and when they had taken their places and were eating, Jesus said, ‘I tell you that one of you is going to betray me – one who is eating with me.’
041	MAR	014	019	They were grieved at this, and began to say to him, one after another, ‘Can it be I?’
041	MAR	014	020	‘It is one of you Twelve,’ said Jesus, ‘the one who is dipping his bread beside me into the dish.
041	MAR	014	021	True, the Son of Man must go, as scripture says of him, yet alas for that man by whom the Son of Man is being betrayed! For that man it would be better never to have been born!’
041	MAR	014	022	While they were eating, Jesus took some bread, and, after saying the blessing, broke it, and gave it to them, and said, ‘Take it; this is my body.’
041	MAR	014	023	Then he took a cup, and, after saying the thanksgiving, gave it to them, and they all drank from it.
041	MAR	014	024	‘This is my covenant-blood,’ he said, ‘which is poured out on behalf of many.
041	MAR	014	025	I tell you that I will never again drink of the fruit of the vine, until that day when I will drink it new in the kingdom of God.’
041	MAR	014	026	They then sang a hymn, and went out up the Mount of Olives,
041	MAR	014	027	presently Jesus said to them, ‘All of you will fall away; for scripture says – “I will strike down the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.”
041	MAR	014	028	Yet, after I have risen, I will go before you into Galilee.’
041	MAR	014	029	‘Even if everyone else falls away,’ said Peter, ‘I will not.’
041	MAR	014	030	‘I tell you,’ answered Jesus, ‘that you yourself today – yes, this very night – before the cock crows twice, will disown me three times.’
041	MAR	014	031	But Peter vehemently protested, ‘Even if I must die with you, I will never disown you!’ And they all said the same.
041	MAR	014	032	Presently they came to a garden known as Gethsemane, and Jesus said to his disciples ‘Sit down here while I pray.’
041	MAR	014	033	He took with him Peter, James, and John; and began to show signs of great dismay and deep distress of mind.
041	MAR	014	034	‘I am sad at heart,’ he said, ‘sad even to death; wait here, and watch.’
041	MAR	014	035	Going on a little further, he threw himself on the ground, and began to pray that, if it were possible, he might be spared that hour.
041	MAR	014	036	‘Abba, Father,’ he said, ‘all things are possible to you; take away this cup from me; yet, not what I will, but what you will.’
041	MAR	014	037	Then he came and found the three apostles asleep. ‘Simon,’ he said to Peter, ‘are you asleep? Couldn’t you watch for one hour?
041	MAR	014	038	Watch and pray,’ he said to them all, ‘so that you may not fall into temptation. True, the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.’
041	MAR	014	039	Again he went away, and prayed in the same words;
041	MAR	014	040	and coming back again he found them asleep, for their eyes were heavy; and they did not know what to say to him.
041	MAR	014	041	A third time he came, and said to them, ‘Sleep on now, and rest yourselves. Enough! My time has come. Look, the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of wicked people.
041	MAR	014	042	Up, and let us be going. Look! My betrayer is close at hand.’
041	MAR	014	043	And just then, while he was still speaking, Judas, who was one of the Twelve, came up; and with him a crowd of people, with swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests, the teachers of the Law, and the elders.
041	MAR	014	044	Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them. ‘The man whom I kiss,’ he had said, ‘will be the one; arrest him and take him away safely.’
041	MAR	014	045	As soon as Judas came, he went up to Jesus at once, and said, ‘Rabbi!’ and kissed him.
041	MAR	014	046	Then the men seized Jesus, and arrested him.
041	MAR	014	047	One of those who were standing by drew his sword, and struck at the high priest’s servant, and cut off his ear.
041	MAR	014	048	But Jesus spoke up, and said to the men, ‘Have you come out, as if after a robber, with swords and clubs, to take me?
041	MAR	014	049	I have been among you day after day in the Temple Courts teaching, and yet you did not arrest me; but this is in fulfilment of the scriptures.’
041	MAR	014	050	And all the apostles deserted him and fled.
041	MAR	014	051	One young man did indeed follow him, wrapped only in a linen sheet. They tried to arrest him;
041	MAR	014	052	but he left the sheet in their hands, and fled naked.
041	MAR	014	053	Then they took Jesus to the high priest; and all the chief priests, elders, and the teachers of the Law assembled.
041	MAR	014	054	Peter, who had followed Jesus at a distance into the courtyard of the high priest, was sitting there among the guards, warming himself at the blaze of the fire.
041	MAR	014	055	Meanwhile the chief priest and the whole of the High Council were trying to get such evidence against Jesus as would warrant his being put to death, but they could not find any;
041	MAR	014	056	for, though there were many who gave false evidence against him, yet their evidence did not agree.
041	MAR	014	057	Presently some men stood up, and gave this false evidence against him –
041	MAR	014	058	‘We ourselves heard him say “I will destroy this Temple made with hands, and in three days build another made without hands.”’
041	MAR	014	059	Yet not even on that point did their evidence agree.
041	MAR	014	060	Then the high priest stood forward, and questioned Jesus. ‘Have you no answer to make?’ he asked. ‘What is this evidence which these men are giving against you?’
041	MAR	014	061	But Jesus remained silent, and made no answer. A second time the high priest questioned him. ‘Are you,’ he asked, ‘the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One?’
041	MAR	014	062	‘I am,’ replied Jesus, ‘and you will all see the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of the Almighty, and coming in the clouds of heaven.’
041	MAR	014	063	At this the high priest tore his vestments. ‘Why do we want any more witnesses?’ he exclaimed.
041	MAR	014	064	‘You heard his blasphemy? What is your verdict?’ They all condemned him, declaring that he deserved death.
041	MAR	014	065	Some of those present began to spit at him, and to blindfold his eyes, and strike him, saying, as they did so, ‘Now play the prophet!’ and even the guards received him with blows.
041	MAR	014	066	While Peter was in the courtyard down below, one of the high priest’s maidservants came up;
041	MAR	014	067	and, seeing Peter warming himself, she looked closely at him, and exclaimed, ‘Why, you were with Jesus, the Nazarene!’
041	MAR	014	068	But Peter denied it. ‘I do not know or understand what you mean,’ he replied. Then he went out into the porch;
041	MAR	014	069	and there the maidservant, on seeing him, began to say again to the bystanders, ‘This is one of them!’
041	MAR	014	070	But Peter again denied it. Soon afterwards the bystanders again said to him, ‘You certainly are one of them; why you are a Galilean!’
041	MAR	014	071	But he said to them, ‘I swear that I do not know the man you are talking about! May God punish me if I am lying!’
041	MAR	014	072	At that moment, for the second time, a cock crowed; and Peter remembered the words that Jesus had said to him – “Before a cock has crowed twice, you will disown me three times”; and, as he thought of it, he began to weep.
041	MAR	015	001	As soon as it was daylight, the chief priests, after holding a consultation with elders and teachers of the Law – that is to say, the whole High Council – put Jesus in chains, and took him away, and gave him up to Pilate.
041	MAR	015	002	‘Are you the king of the Jews?’ asked Pilate. ‘It is true,’ replied Jesus.
041	MAR	015	003	Then the chief priests brought a number of charges against him.
041	MAR	015	004	So Pilate questioned Jesus again. ‘Have you no reply to make?’ he asked. ‘Listen, how many charges they are bringing against you.’
041	MAR	015	005	But Jesus still made no reply whatever; at which Pilate was astonished.
041	MAR	015	006	Now, at the feast, Pilate used to grant the people the release of any one prisoner whom they might ask for.
041	MAR	015	007	A man called Barabbas was in prison, with the rioters who had committed murder during a riot.
041	MAR	015	008	So, when the crowd went up and began to ask Pilate to follow his usual custom,
041	MAR	015	009	he answered, ‘Do you want me to release the “king of the Jews” for you?’
041	MAR	015	010	For he was aware that it was out of jealousy that the chief priests had given Jesus up to him.
041	MAR	015	011	But the chief priests incited the crowd to get Barabbas released instead.
041	MAR	015	012	Pilate, however, spoke to them again, ‘What should I do then with the man whom you call the “king of the Jews”?’
041	MAR	015	013	Again they shouted, ‘Crucify him!’
041	MAR	015	014	‘Why, what harm has he done?’ Pilate kept saying to them. But they shouted furiously, ‘Crucify him!’
041	MAR	015	015	And Pilate, wishing to satisfy the crowd, released Barabbas to them, and, after scourging Jesus, gave him up to be crucified.
041	MAR	015	016	The soldiers then took Jesus away into the courtyard – that is the Government house – and they called the whole garrison together.
041	MAR	015	017	They dressed him in a purple robe, and, having twisted a crown of thorns, put it on him,
041	MAR	015	018	and then began to salute him. ‘Long life to you, king of the Jews!’ they said.
041	MAR	015	019	And they kept striking him on the head with a rod, spitting at him, and bowing to the ground before him – going down on their knees;
041	MAR	015	020	and, when they had left off mocking him, they took off the purple robe, and put his own clothes on him.
041	MAR	015	021	They led Jesus out to crucify him; and they compelled a passer-by, Simon from Cyrene, who was on his way in from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to go with them to carry his cross.
041	MAR	015	022	They brought Jesus to the place which was known as Golgotha – a name which means “place of a Skull.”
041	MAR	015	023	There they offered him drugged wine; but Jesus refused it.
041	MAR	015	024	Then they crucified him, and divided his clothes among them, casting lots for them, to settle what each should take.
041	MAR	015	025	It was nine in the morning when they crucified him.
041	MAR	015	026	The words of the charge against him, written up over his head, read – “THE KING OF THE JEWS.”
041	MAR	015	027	And with him they crucified two robbers, one on the right, and the other on the left.
041	MAR	015	029	The passers-by railed at him, shaking their heads, as they said, ‘Ah! You who would destroy the Temple and build one in three days,
041	MAR	015	030	come down from the cross and save yourself!’
041	MAR	015	031	In the same way the chief priests, with the teachers of the Law, said to one another in mockery,
041	MAR	015	032	‘He saved others, but he cannot save himself! Let the Christ, the “king of Israel,” come down from the cross now so that we can see it and believe.’ Even the men who had been crucified with Jesus insulted him.
041	MAR	015	033	At midday, a darkness came over the whole country, lasting until three in the afternoon.
041	MAR	015	034	And, at three, Jesus called out loudly, ‘Eloi, Eloi, lama sabacthani?’ which means “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”
041	MAR	015	035	Some of those standing round heard this, and said, ‘Listen! He is calling for Elijah!’
041	MAR	015	036	And a man ran, and, soaking a sponge in common wine, put it on the end of a rod, and offered it to him to drink, saying as he did so, ‘Wait and let us see if Elijah is coming to take him down.’
041	MAR	015	037	But Jesus, giving a loud cry, breathed his last.
041	MAR	015	038	The Temple curtain was torn in two from top to bottom.
041	MAR	015	039	The Roman officer, who was standing facing Jesus, on seeing the way in which he breathed his last, exclaimed, ‘This man must indeed have been God’s son!’
041	MAR	015	040	There were some women also watching from a distance, among them being Mary of Magdala, Mary the mother of James the Little and of Joseph, and Salome –
041	MAR	015	041	all of whom used to accompany Jesus when he was in Galilee, and give him support – besides many other women who had come up with him to Jerusalem.
041	MAR	015	042	The evening had already fallen, when, as it was the Preparation day – the day before the Sabbath –
041	MAR	015	043	Joseph from Arimathea, a councillor of good position, who was himself living in expectation of the kingdom of God, came and ventured to go in to see Pilate, and to ask for the body of Jesus.
041	MAR	015	044	But Pilate was surprised to hear that he had already died. So he sent for the officer, and asked if he were already dead;
041	MAR	015	045	and, on learning from the officer that it was so, he gave the corpse to Joseph.
041	MAR	015	046	Joseph, having bought a linen sheet, took Jesus down, and wound the sheet round him, and laid him in a tomb which had been cut out of the rock; and then rolled a stone up against the entrance of the tomb.
041	MAR	015	047	Mary of Magdala and Mary, the mother of Joseph, were watching to see where he was laid.
041	MAR	016	001	When the Sabbath was over, Mary of Magdala, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought some spices, so that they might go and anoint the body of Jesus.
041	MAR	016	002	Very early on the first day of the week they went to the tomb, after sunrise.
041	MAR	016	003	They were saying to one another, ‘Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance of the tomb?’
041	MAR	016	004	But, on looking up, they saw that the stone had already been rolled back; it was a very large one.
041	MAR	016	005	Going into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on their right, in a white robe, and they were dismayed; but he said to them,
041	MAR	016	006	‘Do not be dismayed; you are looking for Jesus, the Nazarene, who has been crucified; he has risen, he is not here! Look! Here is the place where they laid him.
041	MAR	016	007	But go, and say to his disciples and to Peter “He is going before you into Galilee; there you will see him, as he told you.”’
041	MAR	016	008	They went out, and fled from the tomb, for they were trembling and bewildered; and they did not say a word to anyone, for they were frightened.
041	MAR	016	009	(note: The most reliable and earliest manuscripts do not include Mark 16:9-20.) After his rising again, early on the first day of the week, Jesus appeared first of all to Mary of Magdala, from whom he had driven out seven demons.
041	MAR	016	010	She went and told the news to those who had been with him and who were now in sorrow and tears;
041	MAR	016	011	yet even they, when they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her, did not believe it.
041	MAR	016	012	Afterwards, altered in appearance, he made himself known to two of them, as they were walking, on their way into the country.
041	MAR	016	013	They also went and told the rest, but they did not believe even them.
041	MAR	016	014	Later on, he made himself known to the Eleven themselves as they were at a meal, and reproached them with their want of faith and their stubbornness, because they did not believe those who had seen him after he had risen from the dead.
041	MAR	016	015	Then he said to them, ‘Go into all the world, and proclaim the good news to all creation.
041	MAR	016	016	He who believes and is baptised will be saved; but he who refuses to believe will be condemned.
041	MAR	016	017	Moreover these signs will attend those who believe. In my name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new languages;
041	MAR	016	018	they will take up snakes in their hands; and, if they drink any poison, it will not hurt them; they will place their hands on sick people and they will recover.’
041	MAR	016	019	So the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven, and sat at the right hand of God.
041	MAR	016	020	But they set out, and made the proclamation everywhere, the Lord working with them, and confirming the message by the signs which attended it. But all that had been revealed to them they reported briefly to Peter and his companions. Afterwards Jesus himself sent out through them, from east to west, the sacred and imperishable proclamation of eternal salvation.

# BOOK	042	LUK	Luke	Luke
042	LUK	001	001	To his Excellency, Theophilus. Many attempts have been already made to draw up an account of those events which have reached their conclusion among us,
042	LUK	001	002	just as they were reported to us by those who from the beginning were eye-witnesses, and afterwards became bearers of the message.
042	LUK	001	003	And, therefore, I also, since I have investigated all these events with great care from their very beginning, have resolved to write a connected history of them for you,
042	LUK	001	004	in order that you may be able to satisfy yourself of the accuracy of the story which you have heard from the lips of others.
042	LUK	001	005	In the reign of Herod, king of Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah, who belonged to the division called after Abijah. His wife, whose name was Elizabeth, was also a descendant of Aaron.
042	LUK	001	006	They were both righteous people, who lived blameless lives, guiding their steps by all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord.
042	LUK	001	007	But they had no child, Elizabeth being barren; and both of them were advanced in years.
042	LUK	001	008	One day, when Zechariah was officiating as priest before God, during the turn of his division,
042	LUK	001	009	it fell to him by lot, in accordance with the practice among the priests, to go into the Temple of the Lord and burn incense;
042	LUK	001	010	and, as it was the Hour of Incense, the people were all praying outside.
042	LUK	001	011	And an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing on the right of the Altar of Incense.
042	LUK	001	012	Zechariah was startled at the sight and was awe-struck.
042	LUK	001	013	But the angel said to him, ‘Do not be afraid, Zechariah; your prayer has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, whom you will call by the name John.
042	LUK	001	014	He will be to you a joy and a delight; and many will rejoice over his birth.
042	LUK	001	015	For he will be great in the sight of the Lord; he will not drink any wine or strong drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit from the very hour of his birth,
042	LUK	001	016	and will reconcile many of the Israelites to the Lord their God.
042	LUK	001	017	He will go before him in the spirit and with the power of Elijah, to reconcile fathers to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous, and so make ready for the Lord a people prepared for him.’
042	LUK	001	018	‘How can I be sure of this?’ Zechariah asked the angel. ‘For I am an old man and my wife is advanced in years.’
042	LUK	001	019	‘I am Gabriel,’ the angel answered, ‘who stands in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news.
042	LUK	001	020	And now you will be silent and unable to speak until the day when this takes place, because you did not believe what I said, though my words will be fulfilled in due course.’
042	LUK	001	021	Meanwhile the people were watching for Zechariah, wondering at his remaining so long in the Temple.
042	LUK	001	022	When he came out, he was unable to speak to them, and they perceived that he had seen a vision there. But Zechariah kept making signs to them, and remained dumb.
042	LUK	001	023	And, as soon as his term of service was finished, he returned home.
042	LUK	001	024	After this his wife, Elizabeth, became pregnant and lived in seclusion for five months.
042	LUK	001	025	‘The Lord has done this for me,’ she said, ‘he has shown me kindness and taken away the public disgrace of childlessness under which I have been living.’
042	LUK	001	026	Six months later the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a town in Galilee called Nazareth,
042	LUK	001	027	to a maiden there who was engaged to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David. Her name was Mary.
042	LUK	001	028	Gabriel came into her presence and greeted her, saying, ‘You have been shown great favour – the Lord is with you.’
042	LUK	001	029	Mary was much disturbed at his words, and was wondering to herself what such a greeting could mean,
042	LUK	001	030	when the angel spoke again, ‘Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favour with God.
042	LUK	001	031	And now, you will conceive and give birth to a son, and you will give him the name Jesus.
042	LUK	001	032	The child will be great and will be called “Son of the Most High,” and the Lord God will give him the throne of his ancestor David,
042	LUK	001	033	and he will reign over the descendants of Jacob for ever; And to his kingdom there will be no end.’
042	LUK	001	034	‘How can this be?’ Mary asked the angel. ‘For I have no husband.’
042	LUK	001	035	‘The Holy Spirit will descend on you,’ answered the angel, ‘and the Power of the Most High will overshadow you; and therefore the child will be called “holy,” and “Son of God.”
042	LUK	001	036	And Elizabeth, your cousin, is herself also expecting a son in her old age; and it is now the sixth month with her, though she is called barren;
042	LUK	001	037	for no promise from God will fail to be fulfilled.’
042	LUK	001	038	‘I am the servant of the Lord,’ exclaimed Mary. ‘Let it be with me as you have said.’ Then the angel left her.
042	LUK	001	039	Soon after this Mary set out, and made her way quickly into the hill-country, to a town in Judah;
042	LUK	001	040	and there she went into Zechariah’s house and greeted Elizabeth.
042	LUK	001	041	When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the child moved within her, and Elizabeth herself was filled with the Holy Spirit,
042	LUK	001	042	and cried aloud, ‘Blessed are you among women, and blessed is your unborn child!
042	LUK	001	043	But how have I this honour, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?
042	LUK	001	044	For, as soon as your greeting reached my ears, the child moved within me with delight!
042	LUK	001	045	Happy indeed is she who believed that the promise which she received from the Lord would be fulfilled.’
042	LUK	001	046	And Mary said: ‘My soul exalts the Lord,
042	LUK	001	047	and my spirit delights in God my Saviour,
042	LUK	001	048	for he has looked with favour on his humble servant girl. From now on all generations will call me blessed!
042	LUK	001	049	‘For the Almighty has done great things for me, and holy is his name.
042	LUK	001	050	He has mercy on those who revere him in every generation.
042	LUK	001	051	‘Mighty are the deeds of his arm! He has scattered the self-satisfied proud,
042	LUK	001	052	he has cast down the mighty from their thrones, and he uplifts the humble,
042	LUK	001	053	he has filled the hungry with good things, and the rich he has sent away empty.
042	LUK	001	054	‘He has stretched out his hand to his servant Israel, ever mindful of his mercy,
042	LUK	001	055	as he promised to our ancestors, to Abraham and his descendants for ever.’
042	LUK	001	056	Mary stayed with Elizabeth about three months, and then returned to her home.
042	LUK	001	057	When Elizabeth’s time came, she gave birth to a son;
042	LUK	001	058	and her neighbours and relatives, hearing of the great goodness of the Lord to her, came to share her joy.
042	LUK	001	059	A week later they met to circumcise the child, and were about to call him Zechariah after his father,
042	LUK	001	060	when his mother spoke up, ‘No, he is to be called John.’
042	LUK	001	061	‘You have no relation of that name!’ they exclaimed;
042	LUK	001	062	and they made signs to the child’s father, to find out what he wished the child to be called.
042	LUK	001	063	Asking for a writing tablet, he wrote the words – “His name is John.” Everyone was surprised
042	LUK	001	064	and immediately Zechariah recovered his voice and the use of his tongue, and began to bless God.
042	LUK	001	065	All their neighbours were awe-struck at this, and throughout the hill-country of Judea the whole story was much talked about.
042	LUK	001	066	All who heard it kept it in mind, asking one another – ‘What can this child be destined to become?’ For the Power of the Lord was with him.
042	LUK	001	067	Then his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit, and, speaking under inspiration, said:
042	LUK	001	068	‘Blessed is the Lord, the God of Israel, who has visited his people and wrought their deliverance,
042	LUK	001	069	and has raised up for us the strength of our salvation in the house of his servant David –
042	LUK	001	070	as he promised by the lips of his holy prophets of old –
042	LUK	001	071	salvation from our enemies and from the hands of all who hate us,
042	LUK	001	072	showing mercy to our ancestors, and mindful of his sacred covenant.
042	LUK	001	073	This was the oath which he swore to our ancestor Abraham –
042	LUK	001	074	that we should be rescued from the hands of our enemies,
042	LUK	001	075	and should serve him without fear in holiness and righteousness, in his presence all our days.
042	LUK	001	076	And you, child, will be called prophet of the Most High, for you will go before the Lord to make ready his way,
042	LUK	001	077	to give his people the knowledge of salvation through the forgiveness of their sins,
042	LUK	001	078	through the tender mercy of our God, whereby the dawn will break on us from heaven,
042	LUK	001	079	to give light to those who live in darkness and the shadow of death, and guide our feet into the way of peace.’
042	LUK	001	080	The child grew and became strong in spirit, and he lived in the wilds until the time came for his appearance before Israel.
042	LUK	002	001	About that time an edict was issued by the Emperor Augustus that a census should be taken of the whole Empire.
042	LUK	002	002	(This was the first census taken while Quirinius was Governor of Syria).
042	LUK	002	003	And everyone went to his own town to be registered.
042	LUK	002	004	Among others Joseph went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Bethlehem, the town of David, in Judea – because he belonged to the family and house of David –
042	LUK	002	005	to be registered with Mary, his engaged wife, who was about to become a mother.
042	LUK	002	006	While they were there her time came,
042	LUK	002	007	and she gave birth to her first child, a son. And because there was no room for them in the inn, she swathed him round and laid him in a manger.
042	LUK	002	008	In that same countryside were shepherds out in the open fields, watching their flocks that night,
042	LUK	002	009	when an angel of the Lord suddenly stood by them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them; and they were seized with fear.
042	LUK	002	010	‘Have no fear,’ the angel said. ‘For I bring you good news of a great joy in store for all the nation.
042	LUK	002	011	This day there has been born to you, in the town of David, a Saviour, who is Christ and Lord.
042	LUK	002	012	And this will be the sign for you. You will find the infant swathed, and lying in a manger.’
042	LUK	002	013	Then suddenly there appeared with the angel a multitude of the heavenly Host, praising God, and singing –
042	LUK	002	014	‘glory to God on high, and on earth peace among those in whom he finds pleasure.’
042	LUK	002	015	Now, when the angels had left them and gone back to heaven, the shepherds said to one another, ‘Let us go at once to Bethlehem, and see this thing that has happened, of which the Lord has told us.’
042	LUK	002	016	So they went quickly, and found Mary and Joseph, and the infant lying in a manger;
042	LUK	002	017	and, when they saw it, they told of all that had been said to them about this child.
042	LUK	002	018	All who heard the shepherds were astonished at their story,
042	LUK	002	019	while Mary treasured in her heart all that they said, and thought about it often.
042	LUK	002	020	And the shepherds went back, giving glory and praise to God for all that they had heard and seen. It had all happened as they had been told.
042	LUK	002	021	Eight days after the birth of the child, when it was time to circumcise him, he received the name Jesus – the name given him by the angel before his conception.
042	LUK	002	022	When the period of purification of mother and child, required by the Law of Moses, came to an end, his parents took the child up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord,
042	LUK	002	023	in compliance with the Law of the Lord that every firstborn male will be dedicated to the Lord,
042	LUK	002	024	and also to offer the sacrifice required by the Law of the Lord – a pair of turtle-doves or two young pigeons.
042	LUK	002	025	There was at that time in Jerusalem a man named Simeon, a righteous and devout man, who lived in constant expectation of Israel’s consulation, and under the guidance of the Holy Spirit.
042	LUK	002	026	It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he should not die until he had seen the Lord’s Christ.
042	LUK	002	027	Moved by the Spirit, Simeon came into the Temple Courts, and, when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him what was customary under the Law,
042	LUK	002	028	Simeon himself took the child in his arms, and blessed God, and said:
042	LUK	002	029	‘Now, Lord, you will let your servant go, according to your word, in peace,
042	LUK	002	030	for my eyes have seen the salvation
042	LUK	002	031	which you have prepared in the sight of all nations –
042	LUK	002	032	a light to bring light to the Gentiles, and to be the glory of your people Israel.’
042	LUK	002	033	While the child’s father and mother were wondering at what was said about him,
042	LUK	002	034	Simeon gave them his blessing, and said to Mary, the child’s mother, ‘This child is appointed to be the cause of the fall and rise of many in Israel, and to be a sign much spoken against –
042	LUK	002	035	Yes, the sword will pierce your own heart – and so the thoughts in many minds will be disclosed.’
042	LUK	002	036	There was also a prophet named Hannah, a daughter of Phanuel and of the tribe of Asher. She was far advanced in years, having lived with her husband for seven years after marriage,
042	LUK	002	037	and then a widow, until she had reached the age of eighty-four. She never left the Temple Courts, but, fasting and praying, worshiped God night and day.
042	LUK	002	038	At that moment she came up, and began publicly to thank God and to speak about the child to all who were looking for the deliverance of Jerusalem.
042	LUK	002	039	When the child’s parents had done everything required by the Law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee to their own town of Nazareth.
042	LUK	002	040	The child grew and became strong and wise, and the blessing of God was on him.
042	LUK	002	041	Every year the child’s parents used to go to Jerusalem at the Passover Festival.
042	LUK	002	042	When Jesus was twelve years old, they went according to custom to Jerusalem,
042	LUK	002	043	and had finished their visit; but, when they started to return, the boy Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem, without their knowing it.
042	LUK	002	044	Thinking that he was with their fellow travellers, they went one day’s journey before searching for him among their relatives and acquaintances;
042	LUK	002	045	and then, as they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem, searching everywhere for him.
042	LUK	002	046	It was not until the third day that they found him in the Temple Courts, sitting among the teachers, now listening to them, now asking them questions.
042	LUK	002	047	All who listened to him marvelled at his intelligence and his answers.
042	LUK	002	048	His parents were amazed when they saw him, and his mother said to him, ‘My child, why have you treated us like this? Your father and I have been searching for you in great distress.’
042	LUK	002	049	‘What made you search for me?’ he answered. ‘Didn’t you know that I must be in my Father’s house?’
042	LUK	002	050	His parents did not understand what he meant.
042	LUK	002	051	However he went down with them to Nazareth, and submitted himself to their control; and his mother treasured all that was said in her heart.
042	LUK	002	052	And Jesus grew in wisdom as he grew in years, and gained the blessing of God and people.
042	LUK	003	001	In the fifteenth year of the reign of the Emperor Tiberius, when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, Herod ruler of Galilee, his brother Philip ruler of the territory comprising Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias ruler of Abilene,
042	LUK	003	002	and when Annas and Caiaphas were high priests, a command from God came to John, the son of Zechariah, while he was in the wilderness.
042	LUK	003	003	And John went through the whole district of the Jordan, proclaiming a baptism of repentance, for the forgiveness of sins.
042	LUK	003	004	This was in fulfilment of what is said in the writings of the prophet Isaiah – “The voice of one crying aloud in the wilderness: ‘Make ready the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.
042	LUK	003	005	Every chasm will be filled, every mountain and hill will be levelled. The winding ways will be straightened, the rough roads made smooth,
042	LUK	003	006	and everyone will see the salvation of God.’”
042	LUK	003	007	And John said to the crowds that went to be baptised by him, ‘You children of snakes! Who has prompted you to seek refuge from the coming judgment?
042	LUK	003	008	Let your lives, then, prove your repentance; and do not begin to say among yourselves “Abraham is our ancestor,” for I tell you that out of these stones God is able to raise descendants for Abraham!
042	LUK	003	009	Already, indeed, the axe is lying at the root of the trees. Therefore every tree that fails to bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.’
042	LUK	003	010	‘What are we to do then?’ the people asked.
042	LUK	003	011	‘Let anyone who has two coats,’ answered John, ‘share with the person who has none; and anyone who has food do the same.’
042	LUK	003	012	Even tax collectors came to be baptised, and said to John, ‘Teacher, what are we to do?’
042	LUK	003	013	‘Do not collect more than you have authority to demand,’ John answered.
042	LUK	003	014	And when some soldiers on active service asked ‘And we – what are we to do?’ he said, ‘Never use violence, or exact anything by false accusation; and be content with your pay.’
042	LUK	003	015	Then, while the people were in suspense, and were all debating with themselves whether John could be the Christ,
042	LUK	003	016	John, addressing them all, said, ‘I, indeed, baptise you with water; but there is coming one more powerful than I, and I am not fit even to unfasten his sandals. He will baptise you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.
042	LUK	003	017	His winnowing-fan is in his hand so that he may clear his threshing-floor, and store the grain in his barn, but the chaff he will burn with a fire that cannot be put out.’
042	LUK	003	018	And so with many different appeals John told his good news to the people.
042	LUK	003	019	But when John rebuked Herod the ruler, for Herodia his brother’s wife, and for all the evil things that he had done,
042	LUK	003	020	Herod crowned them all by shutting John up in prison.
042	LUK	003	021	Now after the baptism of all the people, and when Jesus had been baptised and was still praying, the heavens opened,
042	LUK	003	022	and the Holy Spirit came down on him in the form of a dove, and from the heavens came a voice – ‘You are my dearly loved son; you bring me great joy.’
042	LUK	003	023	When beginning his work, Jesus was about thirty years old. He was regarded as the son of Joseph, whose ancestors were – Eli,
042	LUK	003	024	Mattith, Levi, Melchiah, Janna, Joseph,
042	LUK	003	025	Mattithiah, Amos, Nahum, Azaliah, Nogah,
042	LUK	003	026	Mattith, Mattithiah, Shimei, Joseph, Josheh,
042	LUK	003	027	Johanan, Rhesa, Zerubbabel, Salathiel, Neriah,
042	LUK	003	028	Melchiah, Addi, Cosam, Elmodam, Er,
042	LUK	003	029	Joshua, Eliezer, Joram, Mattith, Levi,
042	LUK	003	030	Simeon, Judah, Joseph, Jonam, Eliakim,
042	LUK	003	031	Meleah, Menan, Mattithiah, Nathan, David,
042	LUK	003	032	Jesse, Obed, Boaz, Salah, Nahshon,
042	LUK	003	033	Aminadab, Arni, Hezron, Perez, Judah,
042	LUK	003	034	Jacob, Isaac, Abraham, Terah, Nahor,
042	LUK	003	035	Serug, Reu, Peleg, Eber, Shelah,
042	LUK	003	036	Kenan, Arpachshad, Shem, Noah, Lamech,
042	LUK	003	037	Methuselah, Enoch, Jared, Mahalalel, Kenan,
042	LUK	003	038	Enosh, Seth, son of Adam, and Adam, son of God.
042	LUK	004	001	On returning from the Jordan, full of the Holy Spirit, Jesus was led by the power of the Spirit through the wilderness for forty days, tempted by the devil.
042	LUK	004	002	All that time he ate nothing; and, when it was over, he became hungry.
042	LUK	004	003	So the devil said to him, ‘If you are God’s Son, tell this stone to become a loaf of bread.’
042	LUK	004	004	And Jesus answered him, ‘Scripture says – “It is not on bread alone that a person is to live.”’
042	LUK	004	005	And the devil led Jesus up, and showing him in a single moment all the kingdoms of the earth, said to him,
042	LUK	004	006	‘I will give you all this power, and the splendour of them; for it has been given into my hands and I give it to whom I wish.
042	LUK	004	007	If you worship me, it will all be yours.’
042	LUK	004	008	And Jesus answered him, ‘Scripture says – “You should worship the Lord your God, and worship him only.”’
042	LUK	004	009	The devil next led him into Jerusalem, and, placing him on the parapet of the Temple, said, ‘If you are God’s Son throw yourself down from here,
042	LUK	004	010	for scripture says – “He will give his angels commands about you, to guard you safely,”
042	LUK	004	011	And “On their hands they will lift you up, otherwise you might strike your foot against a stone.”’
042	LUK	004	012	But Jesus answered him, ‘It is said – “You must not tempt the Lord your God.”’
042	LUK	004	013	When he had tried every kind of temptation, the devil left Jesus, until another opportunity.
042	LUK	004	014	Moved by the power of the Spirit, Jesus returned to Galilee. Reports about him spread through all that region;
042	LUK	004	015	and he began to teach in their synagogues, and was honoured by everyone.
042	LUK	004	016	Coming to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, Jesus, as was his custom, went on the Sabbath into the synagogue, and stood up to read the scriptures.
042	LUK	004	017	He was given the book of the prophet Isaiah; and Jesus opened the book and found the place where it says –
042	LUK	004	018	“The Spirit of the Lord is on me, for he has consecrated me to bring good news to the poor, he has sent me to proclaim release to captives and restoration of sight to the blind, to set the oppressed at liberty,
042	LUK	004	019	to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favour.”
042	LUK	004	020	Then, closing the book and returning it to the attendant, he sat down. The eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him,
042	LUK	004	021	and Jesus began, ‘This very day this passage has been fulfilled in your hearing.’
042	LUK	004	022	All who were present spoke well of him, and were astonished at the beautiful words that fell from his lips. ‘Isn’t this Joseph’s son?’ they asked.
042	LUK	004	023	‘Doubtless,’ said Jesus, ‘you will remind me of the saying – “Doctor, cure yourself;” and you will say “Do here in your own country all that we have heard that has been done at Capernaum.”
042	LUK	004	024	I tell you,’ he continued, ‘that no prophet is acceptable in his own country.
042	LUK	004	025	There were, doubtless, many widows in Israel in Elijah’s days, when the heavens were closed for three years and six months, and a severe famine prevailed throughout the country;
042	LUK	004	026	and yet it was not to one of them that Elijah was sent, but to a widow at Zarephath in Sidonia.
042	LUK	004	027	And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of the prophet Elisha, yet it was not one of them who was made clean, but Naaman the Syrian.’
042	LUK	004	028	All the people in the synagogue, as they listened to this, became enraged.
042	LUK	004	029	Starting up, they drove Jesus out of the town, and led him to the brow of the hill on which their town stood, intending to hurl him down.
042	LUK	004	030	But he passed through the middle of the crowd and went on his way.
042	LUK	004	031	Then Jesus went down to Capernaum, a city in Galilee. On the Sabbath he taught the people.
042	LUK	004	032	They were amazed at his teaching, because his words were spoken with authority.
042	LUK	004	033	In the synagogue there was a man with the spirit of a foul demon in him, who called out loudly,
042	LUK	004	034	‘Stop! What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are – the Holy One of God!’
042	LUK	004	035	But Jesus rebuked the demon. ‘Be silent! Come out from him,’ he said. The demon flung the man down in the middle of the people, and then came out from him, without causing him further harm.
042	LUK	004	036	And they were all lost in amazement, and kept saying to one another, ‘What words are these? For he gives his commands to the foul spirits with a marvellous authority, and they come out.’
042	LUK	004	037	And rumours about Jesus traveled through every place in the region.
042	LUK	004	038	On leaving the synagogue, Jesus went into Simon’s house. Now Simon’s mother-in-law was suffering from a severe attack of fever, and they asked Jesus to cure her.
042	LUK	004	039	Bending over her, he rebuked the fever; the fever left her, and she immediately got up and began to take care of them.
042	LUK	004	040	At sunset, all who had friends suffering from various diseases took them to Jesus; and he placed his hands on everyone of them and cured them.
042	LUK	004	041	And even demons came out from many people, screaming “You are the Son of God.” Jesus rebuked them, and would not allow them to speak, because they knew that he was the Christ.
042	LUK	004	042	At daybreak, Jesus went out and walked to a lonely spot. But crowds of people began to look for him; and they came to where he was and tried to detain him and prevent his leaving them.
042	LUK	004	043	Jesus, however, said to them, ‘I must take the good news of the kingdom of God to the other towns too, for that was why I was sent.’
042	LUK	004	044	And he continued to make his proclamation in the synagogues of Judea.
042	LUK	005	001	Once, when the people were pressing round Jesus as they listened to God’s message, he happened to be standing by the shore of the Lake of Gennesaret, and saw two boats close to the shore.
042	LUK	005	002	The fishermen had gone away from them and were washing the nets.
042	LUK	005	003	So, getting into one of the boats, which belonged to Simon, Jesus asked him to push off a little way from the shore, and then sat down and taught the people from the boat.
042	LUK	005	004	When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, ‘Push off into deep water, and throw out your nets for a haul.’
042	LUK	005	005	‘We have been hard at work all night, Sir,’ answered Simon, ‘and have not caught anything, but, at your bidding, I will throw out the nets.’
042	LUK	005	006	They did so, and enclosed such a great shoal of fish that their nets began to break.
042	LUK	005	007	So they signalled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them; and they came and filled both the boats so full of fish that they were almost sinking.
042	LUK	005	008	When Simon Peter saw this, he threw himself down at Jesus’ knees, exclaiming, ‘Master, leave me, for I am a sinful man!’
042	LUK	005	009	For he and all who were with him were lost in amazement at the haul of fish which they had made;
042	LUK	005	010	and so, too, were James and John, Zebedee’s sons, who were Simon’s partners. ‘Do not be afraid,’ Jesus said to Simon, ‘from today you will catch people.’
042	LUK	005	011	And, when they had brought their boats to shore, they left everything, and followed him.
042	LUK	005	012	On one occasion Jesus was staying in a town, when he saw a man who was covered with leprosy. When the leper saw Jesus, he threw himself on his face and implored his help, ‘Master, if only you are willing, you are able to make me clean.’
042	LUK	005	013	Stretching out his hand, Jesus touched him, saying as he did so, ‘I am willing; become clean.’ Instantly the leprosy left the man;
042	LUK	005	014	and then Jesus impressed on him that he was not to say a word to anyone, ‘but,’ he added, ‘set out and show yourself to the priest, and make the offerings for your cleansing, in the manner directed by Moses, as evidence of your cure.’
042	LUK	005	015	However, the story about Jesus spread all the more, and great crowds came together to listen to him, and to be cured of their illnesses;
042	LUK	005	016	but Jesus used to withdraw to lonely places and pray.
042	LUK	005	017	On one of those days, when Jesus was teaching, some Pharisees and Doctors of the Law were sitting near by. (They had come from all the villages in Galilee and Judea, and from Jerusalem; and the power of the Lord was on Jesus, so that he could work cures.)
042	LUK	005	018	And there some men brought on a bed a man who was paralysed. They tried to get him in and lay him before Jesus;
042	LUK	005	019	but, finding no way of getting him in owing to the crowd, they went up on the roof and lowered him through the tiles, with his pallet, into the middle of the people and in front of Jesus.
042	LUK	005	020	When he saw their faith, Jesus said, ‘Friend, your sins have been forgiven you.’
042	LUK	005	021	The teachers of the Law and the Pharisees began debating about this. ‘Who is this man who speaks so blasphemously?’ they asked. ‘Who can forgive sins except God?’
042	LUK	005	022	When Jesus became aware of the way in which they were debating, he turned to them and exclaimed, ‘What are you debating with yourselves?
042	LUK	005	023	Which is the easier? – to say “Your sins have been forgiven you”? Or to say “Get up, and walk”?
042	LUK	005	024	But so that you may know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins’ – he spoke to the paralysed man – ‘To you I say, Get up, and take up your pallet, and go to your home.’
042	LUK	005	025	Instantly the man stood up before their eyes, took up what he had been lying on, and went to his home, praising God.
042	LUK	005	026	The people, one and all, were lost in amazement, and praised God; and in great awe they said, ‘We have seen marvellous things today!’
042	LUK	005	027	After this, Jesus went out; and he noticed a tax-gatherer, named Levi, sitting in the tax office, and said to him, ‘Follow me.’
042	LUK	005	028	Levi left everything and got up and followed him.
042	LUK	005	029	And Levi gave a great banquet at his house, in honour of Jesus; and a large number of tax collectors and others were having dinner with them.
042	LUK	005	030	The Pharisees and the teachers of the Law belonging to their party complained of this to the disciples of Jesus.
042	LUK	005	031	In answer Jesus said, ‘It is not those who are well who need a doctor, but those who are ill.
042	LUK	005	032	I have not come to call the religious, but the outcast, to repent.’
042	LUK	005	033	‘John’s disciples,’ they said to Jesus, ‘Often fast and say prayers, and so do the disciples of the Pharisees, while yours are eating and drinking!’
042	LUK	005	034	But Jesus answered them, ‘Can you make the groom’s friends fast while the groom is with them?
042	LUK	005	035	But the days will come – a time when the groom will be taken away from them; and they will fast then, when those days come.’
042	LUK	005	036	Then, as an illustration, Jesus said to them, ‘No one ever tears a piece from a new garment and puts it on an old one; for, if they do, they will not only tear the new garment, but the piece from the new one will not match the old.
042	LUK	005	037	And no one puts new wine into old wine-skins; for, if they do, the new wine will burst the skins, and the wine itself will run out, and the skins be lost.
042	LUK	005	038	But new wine must be put into fresh skins.
042	LUK	005	039	No one after drinking old wine wishes for new. “No,” they say, “the old is excellent.”’
042	LUK	006	001	One Sabbath Jesus was walking through cornfields, and his disciples were picking the ears of wheat, and rubbing them in their hands, and eating them.
042	LUK	006	002	‘Why are you doing what it is not allowable to do on the Sabbath?’ asked some of the Pharisees.
042	LUK	006	003	Jesus’ answer was, ‘Haven’t you read even of what David did, when he was hungry, he and his companions –
042	LUK	006	004	That he went into the house of God, and took the consecrated bread and ate it, and gave some to his companions, though only the priests are allowed to eat it?’
042	LUK	006	005	Then Jesus added, ‘The Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath.’
042	LUK	006	006	On another Sabbath Jesus went into the synagogue and taught; and there was a man there whose right hand was withered.
042	LUK	006	007	The teachers of the Law and the Pharisees watched Jesus closely, to see if he would work cures on the Sabbath, so that they might find a charge to bring against him.
042	LUK	006	008	Jesus, however, knew what was in their minds, and said to the man whose hand was withered, ‘Stand up and come out into the middle.’ The man stood up,
042	LUK	006	009	and Jesus said to them, ‘I ask you, is it allowable to do good on the Sabbath – or harm? To save a life, or let it perish?’
042	LUK	006	010	Then, looking round at them all, he said to the man, ‘Stretch out your hand.’ The man did so; and his hand had become sound.
042	LUK	006	011	But the teachers of the Law and the Pharisees were mad with rage, and consulted together what they could do to Jesus.
042	LUK	006	012	Now about that time, Jesus went out, up the hill, to pray, and spent the whole night in prayer to God.
042	LUK	006	013	When day came, he summoned his disciples, and chose twelve of them, whom he also named “apostles.”
042	LUK	006	014	They were Simon (whom Jesus also named Peter), and his brother Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew,
042	LUK	006	015	Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Simon known as the Zealot,
042	LUK	006	016	Judas son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who proved a traitor.
042	LUK	006	017	Afterwards Jesus came down the hill with them and took his stand on a level place. With him were a large crowd of his disciples, and great numbers of people from the whole of Judea, Jerusalem, and the coast district of Tyre and Sidon,
042	LUK	006	018	who had come to hear him and to be restored to health. Those, too, who were troubled with foul spirits were cured;
042	LUK	006	019	and everyone in the crowd was trying to touch him, because a power went out from him which restored them all.
042	LUK	006	020	Then, raising his eyes and looking at his disciples, Jesus said: ‘Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.
042	LUK	006	021	Blessed are you who hunger now, for you will be satisfied. Blessed are you who weep now, for you will laugh.
042	LUK	006	022	Blessed are you when people hate you, and when they expel you from among them, and insult you, and reject your name as an evil thing – because of the Son of Man.
042	LUK	006	023	Then indeed you may be glad and dance for joy, for be sure that your reward in heaven will be great; for that is what their ancestors did to the prophets.
042	LUK	006	024	But alas for you who are rich, for you have had your comforts in full.
042	LUK	006	025	Alas for you who are sated now, for you will hunger. Alas for you who laugh now, for you will mourn and weep.
042	LUK	006	026	Alas for you when everyone speaks well of you; for this is what their ancestors did to the false prophets.
042	LUK	006	027	But to you who hear I say – love your enemies, show kindness to those who hate you,
042	LUK	006	028	bless those who curse you, pray for those who insult you.
042	LUK	006	029	When someone gives one of you a blow on the cheek, offer the other cheek as well; and, when anyone takes away your cloak, do not keep back your coat either.
042	LUK	006	030	Give to everyone who asks of you; and, when anyone takes away what is yours, do not demand its return.
042	LUK	006	031	Do to others as you wish them to do to you.
042	LUK	006	032	If you love only those who love you, what thanks will be due to you? Why, even the outcast love those who love them!
042	LUK	006	033	For, if you show kindness only to those who show kindness to you, what thanks will be due to you? Even the outcast do that!
042	LUK	006	034	If you lend only to those from whom you expect to get something, what thanks will be due to you? Even the outcast lend to the outcast in the hope of getting as much in return!
042	LUK	006	035	But love your enemies, and show them kindness, and lend to them, never despairing. Then your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High, for he is kind to the thankless and the bad.
042	LUK	006	036	Learn to be merciful – even as your Father is merciful.
042	LUK	006	037	Do not judge, and you will not be judged; do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven.
042	LUK	006	038	Give, and others will give to you. A generous measure, pressed and shaken down, and running over, will they pour into your lap; for the standard you use will be the standard used for you.’
042	LUK	006	039	Then, speaking in parables, Jesus said, ‘Can one blind person guide another? Will they not both fall into a ditch?
042	LUK	006	040	A student is not above their teacher; yet every finished student will be like their teacher.
042	LUK	006	041	And why do you look at the speck of sawdust in someone’s eye, while you pay no attention at all to the plank of wood in your own?
042	LUK	006	042	How can you say to your friend “Friend, let me take out the speck in your eye,” while you yourself do not see the plank in your own? Hypocrite! Take out the plank from your own eye first, and then you will see clearly how to take out the speck in your friend’s.
042	LUK	006	043	There is no such thing as a good tree bearing worthless fruit, or, on the other hand, a worthless tree bearing good fruit.
042	LUK	006	044	For every tree is known by its own fruit. People do not gather figs off thorn bushes, nor pick a bunch of grapes off a bramble.
042	LUK	006	045	A good person, from the good stores of their heart, brings out what is good; while a bad person, from their bad stores, brings out what is bad. For what fills someone’s heart will rise to their lips.
042	LUK	006	046	Why do you call me “Master! Master!” and yet fail to do what I tell you?
042	LUK	006	047	Everyone who comes to me and listens to my teaching and acts on it – I will show you to whom they may be compared.
042	LUK	006	048	They may be compared to a person building a house, who dug, and went deep, and laid the foundation on the rock. Then, when a flood came, the river swept down on that house, but had no power to shake it, because it had been built well.
042	LUK	006	049	But those who have listened and not acted on what they have heard may be compared to a person who built a house on the ground without any foundation. The river swept down on it, and the house immediately collapsed; and great was the crash that followed.’
042	LUK	007	001	When Jesus had finished all he had to say to the people, he entered Capernaum.
042	LUK	007	002	A centurion in the Roman army had a slave whom he valued, and who was seriously ill – almost at the point of death.
042	LUK	007	003	And, hearing about Jesus, he sent some Jewish elders to him, with the request that he would come and save his slave’s life.
042	LUK	007	004	When they found Jesus, they earnestly implored him to help. ‘He deserves this favour from you.’ they said,
042	LUK	007	005	‘He is devoted to our people, and even built our synagogue for us.’
042	LUK	007	006	So Jesus went with them. But, when he was no great distance from the house, the centurion sent some friends with the message – ‘Do not trouble yourself, Sir; for I am unworthy to receive you under my roof.
042	LUK	007	007	That was why I did not even venture to come to you myself; but speak, and let my manservant be cured.
042	LUK	007	008	For I myself am a man under the orders of others, with soldiers under me; and if I say to one of them “Go,” he goes, and to another “Come,” he comes, and to my slave “Do this,” he does it.’
042	LUK	007	009	Jesus was surprised to hear these words from him; and, turning to the crowd which was following him, he said, ‘I tell you, nowhere in Israel have I met with such faith as this!’
042	LUK	007	010	And, when the messengers returned to the house, they found the slave recovered.
042	LUK	007	011	Shortly after, Jesus went to a town called Nain, his disciples and a great crowd going with him.
042	LUK	007	012	Just as he approached the gate of the town, there was a dead man being carried out for burial – an only son, and his mother was a widow. A large number of the people of the town were with her.
042	LUK	007	013	When he saw her, the Master was moved with compassion for her, and he said to her, ‘Do not weep.’
042	LUK	007	014	Then he went up and touched the bier, and the bearers stopped; and Jesus said, ‘Young man, I am speaking to you – Rise!’
042	LUK	007	015	The dead man sat up and began to talk, and Jesus restored him to his mother.
042	LUK	007	016	Everyone was awe-struck and began praising God. ‘A great prophet has arisen among us,’ they said. ‘God has visited his people.’
042	LUK	007	017	And this story about Jesus spread all through Judea, and in the neighbouring countries as well.
042	LUK	007	018	All these events were reported to John by his disciples.
042	LUK	007	019	So he summoned two of them, and sent them to the Master to ask – ‘Are you “the coming one,” or are we to look for someone else?’
042	LUK	007	020	When these men found Jesus, they said, ‘John the Baptist has sent us to you to ask – Are you “the coming one,” or are we to look for somebody else?’
042	LUK	007	021	At that very time Jesus had cured many people of diseases, afflictions, and wicked spirits, and had given many blind people their sight.
042	LUK	007	022	So his answer to the question was, ‘Go and report to John what you have witnessed and heard – the blind recover their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are made clean, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised to life, the good news is told to the poor.
042	LUK	007	023	And blessed is the person who finds no hindrance in me.’
042	LUK	007	024	When John’s messengers had left, Jesus, speaking to the crowds, began to say with reference to John,
042	LUK	007	025	‘What did you go out into the wilderness to look at? A reed waving in the wind? If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in rich clothing? Why, those who are accustomed to fine clothes and luxury live in royal palaces.
042	LUK	007	026	What then did you go to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and far more than a prophet.
042	LUK	007	027	This is the man of whom scripture says – “I am sending my messenger ahead of you, and he will prepare your way before you.”
042	LUK	007	028	There is, I tell you, no one born of a woman who is greater than John; and yet the least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.’
042	LUK	007	029	(All the people, when they heard this, and even the tax collectors, having accepted John’s baptism, acknowledged the justice of God.
042	LUK	007	030	But the Pharisees and the students of the Law, having rejected John’s baptism, frustrated God’s purpose in regard to them.)
042	LUK	007	031	‘To what then,’ Jesus continued, ‘should I compare the people of the present generation? What are they like?
042	LUK	007	032	They are like some little children who are sitting in the marketplace and calling out to one another – “We have played the flute for you, but you have not danced; We have wailed, but you have not wept!”
042	LUK	007	033	For now that John the Baptist has come, not eating bread or drinking wine, you are saying “He has a demon in him”;
042	LUK	007	034	and now that the Son of Man has come, eating and drinking, you are saying “Here is a glutton and a wine-drinker, a friend of tax collectors and outcasts.”
042	LUK	007	035	And yet wisdom is vindicated by all her children.’
042	LUK	007	036	One of the Pharisees asked Jesus to dine with him, so Jesus went to his house and took his place at the table.
042	LUK	007	037	Just then a woman, who was an outcast in the town, having heard that Jesus was eating in the Pharisee’s house, brought an alabaster jar of perfume,
042	LUK	007	038	and placed herself behind Jesus, near his feet, weeping. Then she began to make his feet wet with her tears, and she dried them with the hair of her head, repeatedly kissing his feet and anointing them with the perfume.
042	LUK	007	039	When the Pharisee who had invited Jesus saw this, he said to himself, ‘Had this man been “the prophet,” he would have known who, and what sort of woman, this is who is touching him, and that she is an outcast.’
042	LUK	007	040	But, addressing him, Jesus said, ‘Simon, I have something to say to you.’ ‘Pray do so, teacher,’ Simon answered; and Jesus began,
042	LUK	007	041	‘There were two people who were in debt to a moneylender; one owed five hundred silver coins, and the other fifty.
042	LUK	007	042	As they were unable to pay, he forgave them both. Which of them, do you think, will love him the more?’
042	LUK	007	043	‘I suppose,’ answered Simon, ‘it will be the man to whom he forgave the greater debt.’ ‘You are right,’ said Jesus,
042	LUK	007	044	and then, turning to the woman, he said to Simon, ‘Do you see this woman? I came into your house – you gave me no water for my feet, but she has made my feet wet with her tears and dried them with her hair.
042	LUK	007	045	You did not give me one kiss, but she, from the moment I came in, has not ceased to kiss my feet.
042	LUK	007	046	You did not anoint even my head with oil, but she has anointed my feet with perfume.
042	LUK	007	047	So I tell you, her great love shows that her sins, many as they are, have been pardoned. One who is pardoned little loves little.’
042	LUK	007	048	Then he said to the woman, ‘Your sins have been pardoned.’
042	LUK	007	049	The other guests began to say to one another, ‘Who is this man who even pardons sins?’
042	LUK	007	050	But Jesus said to the woman, ‘Your faith has delivered you; go, and peace be with you.’
042	LUK	008	001	Shortly afterwards, Jesus went on a journey through the towns and villages, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God. With him went the Twelve,
042	LUK	008	002	as well as some women who had been cured of wicked spirits and of infirmities. They were Mary, known as Mary of Magdala (from whom seven demons had been expelled),
042	LUK	008	003	and Joanna (the wife of Herod’s steward, Chuza), and Susannah, and many others – all of whom provided for Jesus and his apostles out of their own resources.
042	LUK	008	004	Once, when a great crowd was collecting, and, when the people of town after town were flocking to Jesus, he spoke to them in the form of a parable,
042	LUK	008	005	‘The sower went out to sow his seed; and, as he was sowing, some of the seed fell along the path and was trodden on; and the wild birds ate it up.
042	LUK	008	006	Other seed fell on rock, and, as soon as it began to grow, because it had no moisture, it withered away.
042	LUK	008	007	Other seed fell in the middle of brambles, but the brambles grew up with it and choked it entirely.
042	LUK	008	008	Other seed fell into rich soil, and grew, and gave a hundredfold return.’ After saying this, Jesus cried aloud, ‘Let those who have ears to hear with hear.’
042	LUK	008	009	His disciples asked Jesus the meaning of this parable.
042	LUK	008	010	‘To you,’ he said, ‘the knowledge of the hidden truths of the kingdom of God has been imparted, but to others in parables only, so that though they have eyes they may not see, and though they have ears, they may not understand.
042	LUK	008	011	This is the parable – The seed is God’s message.
042	LUK	008	012	By the seed which fell along the path are meant those who hear the message; but then comes the devil and carries away the message from their minds, to prevent their believing it and being saved.
042	LUK	008	013	By the seed which fell on the rock are meant those who, as soon as they hear the message, welcome it joyfully; but they have no root, and believe it only for a time, and, when the time of temptation comes, they draw back.
042	LUK	008	014	By that which fell among the brambles are meant those who hear the message, but who, as they go on their way, are completely choked by this world’s cares and wealth and pleasures, and bring nothing to perfection.
042	LUK	008	015	But by that in the good ground are meant those who, having heard the message, keep it in the good, rich soil of their hearts, and patiently yield a return.
042	LUK	008	016	‘No one sets light to a lamp and then covers it with a bowl or puts it underneath a couch, but they put it on a lamp-stand, so that anyone who comes in may see the light.
042	LUK	008	017	Nothing is hidden which will not be brought into the light of day, not ever kept hidden which will not some day become known and come into the light of day.
042	LUK	008	018	Take care, then, how you listen. For, to all those who have, more will be given; while, from all those who have nothing, even what they seem to have will be taken away.’
042	LUK	008	019	Presently Jesus’ mother and brothers came where he was, but they were not able to join him because of the crowd.
042	LUK	008	020	So word was brought to him – “Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, wanting to see you.”
042	LUK	008	021	His reply, spoken to them all, was, ‘My mother and my brothers are those who listen to God’s teaching and do what it says.’
042	LUK	008	022	One day about that time, Jesus got into a boat with his disciples and said to them, ‘Let us go across the lake.’
042	LUK	008	023	So they put off. While they were sailing, Jesus fell asleep. A squall swept down on the lake, and their boat was filling and they were in danger.
042	LUK	008	024	So the disciples came and roused him. ‘Sir, Sir,’ they cried, ‘we are lost!’ Jesus rose and rebuked the wind and the rushing waves, and they fell, and a calm followed.
042	LUK	008	025	‘Where is your faith?’ he exclaimed. But in great awe and amazement they said to one another, ‘Who can this be, who commands even the winds and the waves, and they obey him?’
042	LUK	008	026	They reached the region of the Gerasenes, which is on the opposite side to Galilee,
042	LUK	008	027	and, on getting ashore, Jesus met a man, who had demons in him, coming out of the town. For a long time this man had worn no clothing, and he had not lived in a house, but in the tombs.
042	LUK	008	028	Catching sight of Jesus, he shrieked out and threw himself down before him, and in a loud voice exclaimed, ‘What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you not to torment me.’
042	LUK	008	029	For Jesus was commanding the foul spirit to come out of the man. On many occasions it had seized him, and, even when secured with chains and fetters, and watched, he would break through anything that bound him, and be driven by the demon into the wilds.
042	LUK	008	030	‘What is your name?’ Jesus asked. ‘Legion,’ he answered (for many demons had taken possession of him);
042	LUK	008	031	and the demons begged Jesus not to order them away into the bottomless pit.
042	LUK	008	032	There was a herd of many pigs close by feeding on the hill-side; and the demons begged Jesus to give them leave to enter into them. Jesus gave them leave.
042	LUK	008	033	They came out from the man and took possession of the pigs; and the herd rushed down the steep slope into the lake and were drowned.
042	LUK	008	034	When the men who tended them saw what had happened, they ran away, and carried the news to the town, and to the country round.
042	LUK	008	035	The people went out to see what had happened, and, when they came to Jesus, they found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting, clothed and in his right mind, at Jesus’ feet; and they were awe-struck.
042	LUK	008	036	Those who had seen it told them how the possessed man had been delivered.
042	LUK	008	037	Then all the people in the region of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to leave them, for they were terrified. Jesus got into a boat and returned.
042	LUK	008	038	The man from whom the demons had gone out begged Jesus to let him be with him; but Jesus sent him away.
042	LUK	008	039	‘Go back to your home,’ he said, ‘and relate the story of all that God has done for you.’ So the man went through the whole town and proclaimed, as he went, all that Jesus had done for him.
042	LUK	008	040	On his return, Jesus was welcomed by the people; for everyone was looking out for him.
042	LUK	008	041	And a man named Jairus, who was a synagogue leader, came to Jesus, and threw himself at Jesus’ feet, with entreaties that he would come to his house,
042	LUK	008	042	because his only daughter, who was about twelve years old, was dying. As Jesus was going, the people were pressing closely round him.
042	LUK	008	043	And a woman, who had suffered from haemorrhage for twelve years, and whom no one could cure,
042	LUK	008	044	came up behind and touched the tassel of his cloak. Instantly the haemorrhage ceased.
042	LUK	008	045	‘Who touched me?’ Jesus asked; and, while everyone was denying having done so, Peter exclaimed, ‘Why, Sir, the people are crowding round you and pressing against you!’
042	LUK	008	046	‘Somebody touched me,’ said Jesus, ‘for I felt that power had gone out from me.’
042	LUK	008	047	Then the woman, when she saw that she was discovered, came forward trembling, and threw herself down before him; and, in the presence of all the people, she told him her reason for touching him, and that she had been cured instantly.
042	LUK	008	048	‘Daughter,’ he said, ‘your faith has delivered you. Go, and peace be with you.’
042	LUK	008	049	Before he had finished speaking, someone came from the house of the synagogue leader and said, ‘Your daughter is dead! Do not trouble the teacher further.’
042	LUK	008	050	But Jesus, hearing this, spoke to the leader, ‘Do not be afraid; only have faith, and she will yet be delivered.’
042	LUK	008	051	When he reached the house, he did not allow anyone to go in with him, except Peter, John, and James, and the child’s father and mother.
042	LUK	008	052	And everyone was weeping and mourning for her. ‘Do not weep,’ Jesus said, ‘she is not dead; she is asleep.’
042	LUK	008	053	They began to laugh at him, for they knew that she was dead.
042	LUK	008	054	But, taking her by the hand, Jesus said in a loud voice, ‘Child, rise!’
042	LUK	008	055	The child’s spirit returned to her, and she instantly stood up; and Jesus ordered them to give her something to eat.
042	LUK	008	056	Her parents were amazed, but Jesus impressed on them that they were not to tell anyone what had happened.
042	LUK	009	001	Jesus called the Twelve together, and gave them power and authority over all demons, as well as to cure diseases.
042	LUK	009	002	He sent them out as his messengers, to proclaim the kingdom of God, and to work cures.
042	LUK	009	003	‘Do not,’ he said to them, ‘take anything for your journey; not even a staff, or a bag, or bread, or any silver, or a change of clothes with you.
042	LUK	009	004	Whatever house you go to stay in, remain there, and leave from that place.
042	LUK	009	005	If people do not welcome you, as you leave that town, shake even the dust off your feet, as a protest against them.’
042	LUK	009	006	Then they set out and went from village to village, telling the good news and curing people everywhere.
042	LUK	009	007	Herod the ruler heard of all that was happening, and was perplexed, because it was said by some that John must be risen from the dead.
042	LUK	009	008	Some again said that Elijah had appeared, and others that one of the old prophets had risen again.
042	LUK	009	009	But Herod himself said, ‘John I beheaded; but who is this of whom I hear such things?’ And he endeavoured to see him.
042	LUK	009	010	When the apostles returned, they related to Jesus all that they had done. Then Jesus went privately to a town called Bethsaida, taking the apostles with him.
042	LUK	009	011	But the people recognised him and followed him in crowds; and Jesus welcomed them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God, while he cured those who were in need of help.
042	LUK	009	012	The day was drawing to a close, when the twelve came up to him, and said, ‘Send the crowd away, so that they may make their way to the villages and farms round about, and find themselves lodgings and provisions, for we are in a lonely spot here.’
042	LUK	009	013	But Jesus said, ‘It is for you to give them something to eat.’ ‘We have not more than five loaves and two fish,’ they answered. ‘Unless indeed we are to go and buy food for all these people.’
042	LUK	009	014	(For the men among them were about five thousand.) ‘Get them seated in companies,’ was his reply, ‘about fifty in each.’
042	LUK	009	015	This they did, and got all the people seated.
042	LUK	009	016	Taking the five loaves and the two fish, Jesus looked up to heaven and said the blessing over them. Then he broke them in pieces, and gave them to his disciples to set before the people.
042	LUK	009	017	Everyone had sufficient to eat, and what was left of the broken pieces was picked up – twelve baskets.
042	LUK	009	018	Afterwards, when Jesus was alone, praying, his disciples joined him, and he asked them this question – ‘Who do the people say that I am?’
042	LUK	009	019	‘John the Baptist,’ was their answer. ‘Others, however, say that you are Elijah, while others say that one of the old prophets has risen again.’
042	LUK	009	020	‘But you,’ he went on, ‘who do you say that I am?’ And to this Peter answered, ‘The Christ of God.’
042	LUK	009	021	Jesus, however, strictly charged them not to say this to anyone;
042	LUK	009	022	he told them that the Son of Man must undergo much suffering, and be rejected by the elders, and chief priests, and teachers of the Law, and be put to death, and rise on the third day.
042	LUK	009	023	And to all present he said, ‘If any one wishes to walk in my steps, they must renounce self, and take up their cross daily, and follow me.
042	LUK	009	024	For whoever wishes to save their life will lose it, and whoever, for my sake, loses his life – that person will save it.
042	LUK	009	025	What good does it do someone if, when they has gained the whole world, they has lost or forfeited themselves?
042	LUK	009	026	Whoever is ashamed of me and of my teaching, the Son of Man will be ashamed of them, when he comes in his glory and the glory of the father and of the holy angels.
042	LUK	009	027	Indeed, I tell you, some who are standing before me will not know death, until they have seen the kingdom of God.’
042	LUK	009	028	About eight days after speaking these words, Jesus went up the mountain to pray, taking with him Peter, John, and James.
042	LUK	009	029	As he was praying, the aspect of his face was changed, and his clothing became a dazzling white.
042	LUK	009	030	And all at once two men were talking with Jesus; they were Moses and Elijah,
042	LUK	009	031	who appeared in a glorified state, and spoke of his departure, which was destined to take place at Jerusalem.
042	LUK	009	032	Peter and his companions had been overpowered by sleep but, suddenly becoming wide awake, they saw Jesus glorified and the two men who were standing beside him.
042	LUK	009	033	And, as Moses and Elijah were passing away from Jesus, Peter exclaimed, ‘Sir, it is good to be here; let us make three tents, one for you, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.’ He did not know what he was saying;
042	LUK	009	034	and, while he was speaking, a cloud came down and enveloped them; and they were afraid, as they passed into the cloud;
042	LUK	009	035	and from the cloud came a voice which said – ‘This is my Son, the Chosen One; him you must hear.’
042	LUK	009	036	And, as the voice ceased, Jesus was found alone. The apostles kept silence, and told no one about any of the things that they had seen.
042	LUK	009	037	The next day, when they had come down from the mountain, a great crowd met Jesus.
042	LUK	009	038	And just then a man in the crowd shouted out, ‘Teacher, I entreat you to look at my son, for he is my only child;
042	LUK	009	039	all at once a spirit will seize him, suddenly shriek out, and throw him into convulsions until he foams, and will leave him only when he is utterly exhausted.
042	LUK	009	040	I entreated your disciples to drive the spirit out, but they could not.’
042	LUK	009	041	‘Faithless and perverse generation!’ Jesus exclaimed, ‘How long must I be with you and have patience with you? Lead your son here.’
042	LUK	009	042	While the boy was coming up to Jesus, the demon dashed him down and threw him into convulsions. But Jesus rebuked the foul spirit, and cured the boy, and gave him back to his father.
042	LUK	009	043	And all present were struck with awe at the majesty of God. In the midst of the general astonishment at all that Jesus was doing, he said to his disciples,
042	LUK	009	044	‘Listen carefully to my words. For the Son of Man is destined to be betrayed into the hands of his fellow men.’
042	LUK	009	045	But the disciples did not understand the meaning of this; it had been concealed from them so that they did not see it, and they were afraid to question him as to what he meant.
042	LUK	009	046	A discussion arose among the disciples as to which of them was the greatest;
042	LUK	009	047	and Jesus, knowing of the discussion that was occupying their thoughts, took hold of a little child, and placed it beside him,
042	LUK	009	048	and then said to them, ‘Anyone who, for the sake of my name, welcomes even this little child is welcoming me; and anyone who welcomes me is welcoming him who sent me as his messenger. For whoever is least among you all – that person is great.’
042	LUK	009	049	John said, ‘Sir, we saw a man driving out demons by using your name, and we tried to prevent him, because he does not follow you with us.’
042	LUK	009	050	‘None of you must prevent him,’ Jesus said to John, ‘whoever is not against you is for you.’
042	LUK	009	051	As the days before his being taken up to heaven were growing few, Jesus set his face resolutely in the direction of Jerusalem; and he sent on messengers in advance.
042	LUK	009	052	On their way, they went into a Samaritan village to make preparations for him,
042	LUK	009	053	but the people there did not welcome him, because his face was set in the direction of Jerusalem.
042	LUK	009	054	When James and John saw this, they said, ‘Master, do you wish us to call for fire to come down from the heavens and consume them?’
042	LUK	009	055	But Jesus turned and rebuked them.
042	LUK	009	056	And they made their way to another village.
042	LUK	009	057	And, while they were on their way, a man said to Jesus, ‘I will follow you wherever you go.’
042	LUK	009	058	‘Foxes have holes,’ he replied, ‘and wild birds their nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.’
042	LUK	009	059	To another man Jesus said, ‘Follow me.’ ‘Let me first go and bury my father,’ said the man.
042	LUK	009	060	But Jesus said, ‘Leave the dead to bury their dead; but go yourself and carry far and wide the news of the kingdom of God.’
042	LUK	009	061	‘Master,’ said another, ‘I will follow you; but first let me say goodbye to my family.’
042	LUK	009	062	But Jesus answered, ‘No one who looks back, after putting their hand to the plough, is fitted for the kingdom of God.’
042	LUK	010	001	After this, the Master appointed seventy-two other disciples, and sent them on as his messengers, two and two, in advance, to every town and place that he was himself intending to visit.
042	LUK	010	002	‘The harvest,’ he said, ‘is abundant, but the labourers are few. Therefore pray to the owner of the harvest to send labourers to gather in his harvest.
042	LUK	010	003	Now, go. Remember, I am sending you out as my messengers like lambs among wolves.
042	LUK	010	004	Do not take a purse with you, or a bag, or sandals; and do not stop to greet anyone on your journey.
042	LUK	010	005	Whatever house you go to stay at, begin by praying for a blessing on it.
042	LUK	010	006	Then, if anyone there is deserving of a blessing, your blessing will rest on him; but if not, it will come back on yourselves.
042	LUK	010	007	Remain at that same house, and eat and drink whatever they offer you; for the worker is worth their wages. Do not keep changing from one house to another.
042	LUK	010	008	Whatever town you visit, if the people welcome you, eat what is set before you;
042	LUK	010	009	cure the sick there, and tell people that the kingdom of God is close at hand.
042	LUK	010	010	But, whatever town you go to visit, if the people do not welcome you, go out into its streets and say
042	LUK	010	011	“We wipe off the dust of your town which has clung to Our feet; still, be assured that the kingdom of God is close at Hand.”
042	LUK	010	012	I tell you that the doom of Sodom will be more bearable on that day than the doom of that town.
042	LUK	010	013	Alas for you, Chorazin! Alas for you, Bethsaida! For, if the miracles which have been done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have sat in sackcloth and ashes and repented long ago.
042	LUK	010	014	Yet the doom of Tyre and Sidon will be more bearable at the judgment than yours.
042	LUK	010	015	And you, Capernaum! Will you exalt yourself to heaven? You will be flung down to Hades.
042	LUK	010	016	Anyone who listens to you is listening to me, and anyone who rejects you is rejecting me; while the person who rejects me is rejecting him who sent me as his messenger.’
042	LUK	010	017	When the seventy-two returned, they exclaimed joyfully, ‘Master, even the demons submit to us when we use your name.’
042	LUK	010	018	And Jesus replied, ‘I have had visions of Satan, fallen, like lightning from the heavens.
042	LUK	010	019	Remember, I have given you the power to trample on snakes and scorpions, and to meet all the strength of the Enemy. Nothing will ever harm you in any way.
042	LUK	010	020	Yet do not rejoice in the fact that the spirits submit to you, but rejoice that your names have been enrolled in heaven.’
042	LUK	010	021	At that same time, moved to exultation by the Holy Spirit, Jesus said: ‘I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that, though you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, you have revealed them to the childlike! Yes, Father, I thank you that this has seemed good to you.
042	LUK	010	022	Everything has been committed to me by my Father; nor does anyone know who the Son is, except the Father, or who the Father is, except the Son and those to whom the Son may choose to reveal him.’
042	LUK	010	023	Then, turning to his disciples, Jesus said to them alone, ‘Blessed are the eyes that see what you are seeing;
042	LUK	010	024	for, I tell you, many prophets and kings wished for the sight of the things which you are seeing, yet never heard them.’
042	LUK	010	025	Just then a student of the Law came forward to test Jesus further. ‘Teacher,’ he said, ‘what must I do if I am to gain eternal life?’
042	LUK	010	026	‘What is said in the Law?’ answered Jesus. ‘What do you read there?’
042	LUK	010	027	His reply was – ‘You must love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbour as you love yourself.’
042	LUK	010	028	‘You have answered right,’ said Jesus, ‘Do that, and you will live.’
042	LUK	010	029	But the man, wanting to justify himself, said to Jesus, ‘And who is my neighbour?’
042	LUK	010	030	To which Jesus replied, ‘A man was once going down from Jerusalem to Jericho when he fell into the hands of robbers, who stripped him of everything, and beat him, and went away leaving him half dead.
042	LUK	010	031	As it chanced, a priest was going down by that road. He saw the man, but passed by on the opposite side.
042	LUK	010	032	A Levite, too, did the same; he came up to the spot, but, when he saw the man, passed by on the opposite side.
042	LUK	010	033	But a Samaritan, traveling that way, came upon the man, and, when he saw him, he was moved with compassion.
042	LUK	010	034	He went to him and bound up his wounds, dressing them with oil and wine, and then put him on his own mule, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.
042	LUK	010	035	The next day he took out two silver coins and gave them to the innkeeper. “Take care of him,” he said, “and whatever more you may spend I will myself repay you on my way back.”
042	LUK	010	036	Now which, do you think, of these three men,’ asked Jesus, ‘proved himself a neighbour to the man who fell into the robbers’ hands?’
042	LUK	010	037	‘The one that took pity on him,’ was the answer; at which Jesus said, ‘Go and do the same yourself.’
042	LUK	010	038	As they continued their journey, Jesus came to a village, where a woman named Martha welcomed him to her house.
042	LUK	010	039	She had a sister called Mary, who seated herself at the Master’s feet, and listened to his teaching;
042	LUK	010	040	but Martha was distracted by the many preparations that she was making. So she went up to Jesus and said, ‘Master, do you approve of my sister’s leaving me to make preparations alone? Tell her to help me.’
042	LUK	010	041	‘Martha, Martha,’ replied the Master, ‘you are anxious and trouble yourself about many things;
042	LUK	010	042	but only a few are necessary, or rather one. Mary has chosen the good part, and it will not be taken away from her.’
042	LUK	011	001	One day Jesus was at a certain place praying, and, when he had finished, one of his disciples said to him, ‘Master, teach us to pray, as John taught his disciples.’
042	LUK	011	002	‘When you pray,’ Jesus answered, ‘say – “Father, may your name be held holy, your kingdom come.
042	LUK	011	003	Give us each day the bread that we will need;
042	LUK	011	004	and forgive us our sins, for we ourselves forgive everyone who wrongs us; and take us not into temptation.”’
042	LUK	011	005	Jesus also said to them, ‘Suppose that one of you who has a friend were to go to him in the middle of the night and say “Friend, lend me three loaves,
042	LUK	011	006	for a friend of mine has arrived at my house after a journey, and I have nothing to offer him;”
042	LUK	011	007	And suppose that the other should answer from inside “Do not trouble me; the door is already fastened, and my children and I are in bed; I cannot get up and give you anything”;
042	LUK	011	008	I tell you that, even though he will not get up and give him anything because he is a friend, yet because of his persistence he will rouse himself and give him what he wants.
042	LUK	011	009	‘And so I say to you – Ask, and your prayer will be granted, search, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened to you.
042	LUK	011	010	For the person who asks receives, everyone who searches finds, and to the person who knocks the door will be opened.
042	LUK	011	011	What father among you, if his son asks him for a fish, will give him a snake instead,
042	LUK	011	012	or, if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion?
042	LUK	011	013	If you, then, naturally wicked though you are, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!’
042	LUK	011	014	Once Jesus was driving out a mute demon, and, when the demon had gone out, the mute man spoke. The people were amazed at this;
042	LUK	011	015	but some of them said, ‘He drives out demons by the help of Beelzebul, the chief of the demons’;
042	LUK	011	016	while others, to test him, asked him for some sign from the heavens.
042	LUK	011	017	Jesus himself, however, was aware of what they were thinking, and said to them, ‘Any kingdom wholly divided against itself becomes a desolation; and a divided house falls.
042	LUK	011	018	So, too, if Satan is wholly divided against himself, how can his kingdom last? Yet you say that I drive out demons by the help of Beelzebul.
042	LUK	011	019	But, if it is by Beelzebul’s help that I drive out demons, by whose help is it that your own sons drive them out? Therefore they will themselves be your judges.
042	LUK	011	020	But, if it is by the hand of God that I drive out demons, then the kingdom of God must already be upon you.
042	LUK	011	021	When a strong man is keeping guard, fully armed, over his own mansion, his property is in safety;
042	LUK	011	022	but, when one still stronger has attacked and overpowered him, he takes away all the weapons on which the other had relied, and divides his spoil.
042	LUK	011	023	Whoever is not with me is against me, and the person who does not help me to gather is scattering.
042	LUK	011	024	No sooner does a foul spirit leave someone, than it passes through places where there is no water, in search of rest; and finding none, it says “I will go back to the home which I left”;
042	LUK	011	025	but, on coming there, it finds it unoccupied, swept, and put in order.
042	LUK	011	026	Then it goes and brings with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in, and make their home there; and the last state of that person proves to be worse than the first.’
042	LUK	011	027	As Jesus was saying this, a woman in the crowd, raising her voice, exclaimed, ‘Happy was the mother who bore you and nursed you!’
042	LUK	011	028	But Jesus replied, ‘Rather, happy are those who listen to God’s message and keep it.’
042	LUK	011	029	As the crowds increased, Jesus began to speak, ‘This generation is a wicked generation. It demands a sign, but no sign will be given it except the sign of Jonah.
042	LUK	011	030	For, as Jonah became a sign to the people of Nineveh, so will the Son of Man be to this generation.
042	LUK	011	031	At the judgment the Queen of the South will rise up with the people of this generation, and will condemn them, because she came from the ends of the earth to listen to the wisdom of Solomon; and here is more than a Solomon!
042	LUK	011	032	At the judgment the men of Nineveh will stand up with this generation, and will condemn it, because they repented at Jonah’s proclamation; and here is more than a Jonah!
042	LUK	011	033	No one lights a lamp, and then puts it in the cellar or under a basket, but he puts it on the lamp-stand, so that anyone who comes in may see the light.
042	LUK	011	034	The lamp of the body is your eye. When your eye is unclouded, your whole body, also, is lit up; but, as soon as your eye is diseased, your body, also, is darkened.
042	LUK	011	035	Take care, therefore, that the inner light is not darkness.
042	LUK	011	036	If, then, your whole body is lit up, and no corner of it darkened, the whole will be lit up, just as when a lamp gives you light by its brilliance.’
042	LUK	011	037	As Jesus finished speaking, a Pharisee asked him to breakfast with him, and Jesus went in and took his place at the table.
042	LUK	011	038	The Pharisee noticed, to his astonishment, that Jesus omitted the ceremonial washing before breakfast.
042	LUK	011	039	But the Master said to him, ‘You Pharisees do, it is true, clean the outside of the cup and of the plate, but inside you yourselves are filled with greed and wickedness.
042	LUK	011	040	Fools! Did not the maker of the outside make the inside too?
042	LUK	011	041	Only give away what is in them in charity, and at once you have the whole clean.
042	LUK	011	042	But alas for you Pharisees! You pay tithes on mint, rue, and herbs of all kinds, and pass over justice and love to God. These last you ought to have put into practice without neglecting the first.
042	LUK	011	043	Alas for you Pharisees! You delight to have the front seat in the synagogues, and to be greeted in the markets with respect.
042	LUK	011	044	Alas for you! You are like unsuspected graves, over which men walk unawares.’
042	LUK	011	045	Here one of the students of the Law interrupted him by saying, ‘Teacher, when you say this, you are insulting us also.’
042	LUK	011	046	But Jesus went on, ‘Alas for you, too, you students of the Law! You load people with loads that are too heavy to carry, but do not, yourselves, touch them with one of your fingers.
042	LUK	011	047	Alas for you! You build the monuments of the prophets whom your ancestors killed.
042	LUK	011	048	You are actually witnesses to your ancestors’ acts and show your approval of them, because, while they killed the prophets, you build tombs for them.
042	LUK	011	049	That is why the wisdom of God said – “I will send to them prophets and apostles,
042	LUK	011	050	some of whom they will persecute and kill, in order that the blood of all the prophets that has been spilt since the creation of the world may be exacted from this generation –
042	LUK	011	051	from the blood of Abel down to the blood of Zechariah, who was slain between the altar and the house of God.” Yes, I tell you, it will be exacted from this generation.
042	LUK	011	052	Alas for you students of the Law! You have taken away the key of the door of knowledge. You have not gone in yourselves and you have hindered those who try to go in.’
042	LUK	011	053	When Jesus left the house, the teachers of the Law and the Pharisees began to press him hard and question him closely on many subjects,
042	LUK	011	054	laying traps for him, so as to seize on anything that he might say.
042	LUK	012	001	Meanwhile the people had gathered in thousands, so that they trod on one another, when Jesus, addressing himself to his disciples, began by saying to them, ‘Be on your guard against the leaven – that is, the hypocrisy – of the Pharisees.
042	LUK	012	002	There is nothing, however covered up, which will not be uncovered, nor anything kept secret which will not become known.
042	LUK	012	003	So all that you have said in the dark will be heard in the light, and what you have spoken in the ear, within closed doors, will be proclaimed on the housetops.
042	LUK	012	004	To you who are my friends I say, Do not be afraid of those who kill the body, but after that can do no more.
042	LUK	012	005	I will show you of whom you should be afraid. Be afraid of him who, after killing you, has the power to fling you into Gehenna. Yes, I say, be afraid of him.
042	LUK	012	006	Are not five sparrows sold for two copper coins? Yet not one of them has escaped God’s notice.
042	LUK	012	007	No, even the hairs of your head are all numbered. Do not be afraid; you are of more value than many sparrows.
042	LUK	012	008	Everyone, I tell you, who publicly acknowledges me, the Son of Man, also, will acknowledge before God’s angels;
042	LUK	012	009	but the person who publicly disowns me will be altogether disowned before God’s angels.
042	LUK	012	010	Everyone who will say anything against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but for the person who slanders the Holy Spirit there will be no forgiveness.
042	LUK	012	011	Whenever they take you before the synagogue Courts or the magistrates or other authorities, do not be anxious as to how you will defend yourselves, or what your defence will be, or what you will say;
042	LUK	012	012	for the Holy Spirit will show you at the moment what you ought to say.’
042	LUK	012	013	‘Teacher,’ a man in the crowd said to Jesus, ‘tell my brother to share the property with me.’
042	LUK	012	014	But Jesus said to him, ‘Man, who made me a judge or an arbiter between you?’
042	LUK	012	015	And then he added, ‘Take care to keep yourselves free from every form of covetousness; for even in the height of their prosperity a person’s true life does not depend on what they have.’
042	LUK	012	016	Then Jesus told them this parable – ‘There was once a rich man whose land was very fertile;
042	LUK	012	017	and he began to ask himself “What will I do, for I have nowhere to store my crops?
042	LUK	012	018	This is what I will do,” he said; “I will pull down my barns and build larger ones, and store all my grain and my goods in them;
042	LUK	012	019	and I will say to myself, Now you have plenty of good things put by for many years; take your ease, eat, drink, and enjoy yourself.”
042	LUK	012	020	But God said to the man “Fool! This very night your life is being demanded; and as for all you have prepared – who will have it?”
042	LUK	012	021	So it is with those who lay by wealth for themselves and are not rich to the glory of God.’
042	LUK	012	022	And Jesus said to his disciples, ‘That is why I say to you, Do not be anxious about the life here – what you can get to eat; or about your body – what you can get to wear.
042	LUK	012	023	For life is more than food, and the body than its clothes.
042	LUK	012	024	Think of the ravens – they neither sow nor reap; they have neither storehouse nor barn; and yet God feeds them! And how much more precious are you than birds!
042	LUK	012	025	But which of you, by being anxious, can prolong your life a moment?
042	LUK	012	026	And, if you cannot do even the smallest thing, why be anxious about other things?
042	LUK	012	027	Think of the lilies, and how they grow. They neither toil nor spin; yet, I tell you, even Solomon in all his splendour was not robed like one of these.
042	LUK	012	028	If, even in the field, God so clothes the grass which is living today and tomorrow will be thrown into the oven, how much more will he clothe you, you of little faith!
042	LUK	012	029	And you – do not be always seeking what you can get to eat or what you can get to drink; and do not waver.
042	LUK	012	030	These are the things for which all the nations of the world are seeking, and your Father knows that you need them.
042	LUK	012	031	No, seek his kingdom, and these things will be added for you.
042	LUK	012	032	So do not be afraid, my little flock, for your Father has been pleased to give you the kingdom.
042	LUK	012	033	‘Sell what belongs to you, and give in charity. Make yourselves purses that will not wear out – an inexhaustible treasure in heaven, where no thief comes near, or moth works ruin.
042	LUK	012	034	For where your treasure is, there also will your heart be.
042	LUK	012	035	Make yourselves ready, with your lamps alight;
042	LUK	012	036	and be like servants who are waiting for their Master’s return from his wedding, so that, when he comes and knocks, they may open the door for him at once.
042	LUK	012	037	Happy are those servants whom, on his return, the Master will find watching. I tell you that he will make himself ready, and have them take their places at the table, and will come and serve them.
042	LUK	012	038	Whether it is late at night, or in the early morning that he comes, if he finds all as it should be, then happy are they.
042	LUK	012	039	This you do know, that, had the owner of the house known at what time the thief was coming, he would have been on the watch, and would not have let his house be broken into.
042	LUK	012	040	You must also prepare, for when you are least expecting him the Son of Man will come.’
042	LUK	012	041	‘Master,’ said Peter, ‘are you telling this parable with reference to us or to everyone?’
042	LUK	012	042	‘Who, then,’ replied the Master, ‘is that trustworthy steward, the careful man, who will be placed by his master over his establishment, to give them their rations at the proper time?
042	LUK	012	043	Happy will that servant be whom his master, when he comes home, will find doing this.
042	LUK	012	044	His master, I tell you, will put him in charge of the whole of his property.
042	LUK	012	045	But should that servant say to himself “My master is a long time coming,” and begin to beat the menservants and the maidservants, and to eat and drink and get drunk,
042	LUK	012	046	that servant’s master will come on a day when he does not expect him, and at an hour of which he is unaware, and will flog him severely and assign him his place among the untrustworthy.
042	LUK	012	047	The servant who knows his master’s wishes and yet does not prepare and act accordingly will receive many lashes;
042	LUK	012	048	while one who does not know his master’s wishes, but acts so as to deserve a flogging, will receive but few. From everyone to whom much has been given much will be expected, and from the man to whom much has been entrusted the more will be demanded.
042	LUK	012	049	I came to cast fire on the earth; and what more can I wish, if it is already kindled?
042	LUK	012	050	There is a baptism that I must undergo, and how great is my distress until it is over!
042	LUK	012	051	Do you think that I am here to bring peace on earth? No, I tell you, but to cause division.
042	LUK	012	052	For from this time, if there are five people in a house, they will be divided, three against two, and two against three.
042	LUK	012	053	Father will be opposed to son and son to father, mother to daughter and daughter to mother, mother-in-law to her daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law to her mother-in-law.’
042	LUK	012	054	And to the people Jesus said, ‘When you see a cloud rising in the west, you say at once “There is a storm coming,” and come it does.
042	LUK	012	055	And when you see that the wind is in the south, you say “It will be burning hot,” and so it proves.
042	LUK	012	056	Hypocrites! You know how to judge of the earth and the sky; how is it, then, that you cannot judge of this time?
042	LUK	012	057	Why don’t you yourselves decide what is right?
042	LUK	012	058	When, for instance, you are going with your opponent before a magistrate, on your way to the court do your best to be quit of him; otherwise he might drag you before the judge, then the judge will hand you over to the bailiff of the court, and the bailiff throw you into prison.
042	LUK	012	059	You will not, I tell you, come out until you have paid the very last cent.’
042	LUK	013	001	Just at that time some people had come to tell Jesus about the Galileans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with the blood of their sacrifices.
042	LUK	013	002	‘Do you suppose,’ replied Jesus, ‘that, because these Galileans have suffered in this way, they were worse sinners than any other Galileans?
042	LUK	013	003	No, I tell you; but, unless you repent, you will all perish as they did.
042	LUK	013	004	Or those eighteen men at Siloam on whom the tower fell, killing them all, do you suppose that they were worse offenders than any other inhabitants of Jerusalem?
042	LUK	013	005	No, I tell you; but, unless you repent, you will all perish in the same manner.’
042	LUK	013	006	And Jesus told them this parable – ‘A man, who had a fig tree growing in his vineyard, came to look for fruit on it, but could not find any.
042	LUK	013	007	So he said to his gardener “Three years now I have come to look for fruit on this fig tree, without finding any! Cut it down. Why should it rob the soil?”
042	LUK	013	008	“Leave it this one year more, Sir,” the man answered, “until I have dug round it and manured it.
042	LUK	013	009	Then, if it bears in future, well and good; but if not, you can have it cut down.”’
042	LUK	013	010	Jesus was teaching on a Sabbath in one of the synagogues,
042	LUK	013	011	and he saw before him a woman who for eighteen years had suffered from weakness owing to her having an evil spirit in her. She was bent double, and was wholly unable to raise herself.
042	LUK	013	012	When Jesus saw her, he called her to him, and said, ‘Woman, you are released from your weakness.’
042	LUK	013	013	He placed his hands on her, and she was instantly made straight, and began to praise God.
042	LUK	013	014	But the synagogue leader, indignant that Jesus had worked the cure on the Sabbath, intervened and said to the people, ‘There are six days on which work ought to be done; come to be cured on one of those, and not on the Sabbath.’
042	LUK	013	015	‘You hypocrites!’ the Master answered him. ‘Does not everyone of you let your ox or your donkey loose from its manger, and take it out to drink, on the Sabbath?
042	LUK	013	016	But this woman, a daughter of Abraham, who has been kept in bondage by Satan for now eighteen years, ought not she to have been released from her bondage on the Sabbath?’
042	LUK	013	017	As he said this, his opponents all felt ashamed; but all the people rejoiced to see all the wonderful things that he was doing.
042	LUK	013	018	So Jesus said, ‘What is the kingdom of God like? And to what can I liken it?
042	LUK	013	019	It is like a mustard seed which a man took and put in his garden. The seed grew and became a tree, and the wild birds roosted in its branches.’
042	LUK	013	020	And again Jesus said, ‘To what can I liken the kingdom of God?
042	LUK	013	021	It is like some yeast which a woman took and covered in three pecks of flour, until the whole had risen.’
042	LUK	013	022	Jesus went through towns and villages, teaching as he went, and making his way towards Jerusalem.
042	LUK	013	023	‘Master,’ someone asked, ‘are there but few in the path of salvation?’ And Jesus answered,
042	LUK	013	024	‘Strive to go in by the narrow door. Many, I tell you, will seek to go in, but they will not be able,
042	LUK	013	025	when once the master of the house has got up and shut the door, while you begin to say, as you stand outside and knock, “Sir, open the door for us.” His answer will be – “I do not know where you come from.”
042	LUK	013	026	Then you will begin to say “We have eaten and drunk in your presence, and you have taught in our streets,” and his reply will be –
042	LUK	013	027	“I do not know where you come from. Leave my presence, all you who are living in wickedness.”
042	LUK	013	028	There, there will be weeping and grinding of teeth, when you see Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, while you yourselves are being driven outside.
042	LUK	013	029	People will come from East and West, and from North and South, and take their places at the banquet in the kingdom of God.
042	LUK	013	030	There are some who are last now who will then be first, and some who are first now who will then be last!’
042	LUK	013	031	Just then some Pharisees came up to Jesus and said, ‘Go away and leave this place, for Herod wants to kill you.’
042	LUK	013	032	But Jesus answered, ‘Go and say to that fox “Look you, I am driving out demons and will be completing cures today and tomorrow, and on the third day I will have done.”
042	LUK	013	033	But today and tomorrow and the day after I must go on my way, because it cannot be that a prophet should meet his end outside Jerusalem.
042	LUK	013	034	Jerusalem! Jerusalem! You who slays the prophets and stones the messengers sent to you – Oh, how often have I wished to gather your children round me, as a hen takes her brood under her wings, and you would not come!
042	LUK	013	035	Verily your house is left to you desolate! And never, I tell you, will you see me, until you say – “Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord.”’
042	LUK	014	001	On one occasion, as Jesus was going, on a Sabbath into the house of one of the leading Pharisees to dine, they were watching him closely.
042	LUK	014	002	There he saw before him a man who was suffering from dropsy.
042	LUK	014	003	‘Is it allowable,’ said Jesus, addressing the students of the Law and the Pharisees, ‘to work a cure on the Sabbath, or is it not?’
042	LUK	014	004	They remained silent. Jesus took hold of the man and cured him, and sent him away.
042	LUK	014	005	And he said to them, ‘Which of you, finding that your son or your ox has fallen into a well, will not immediately pull them out on the Sabbath day?’
042	LUK	014	006	And they could not make any answer to that.
042	LUK	014	007	Observing that the guests were choosing the best places for themselves, Jesus told them this parable –
042	LUK	014	008	‘When you are invited by anyone to a wedding banquet, do not seat yourself in the best place. Someone of higher rank might have been invited by your host;
042	LUK	014	009	and the host who invited you both will come and say to you “Make room for this person,” and then you will begin in confusion to take the lowest place.
042	LUK	014	010	No, when you are invited, go and take the lowest place, so that, when the host who has invited you comes, he may say to you “Friend, come higher up”; and then you will be honoured in the eyes of all your fellow guests.
042	LUK	014	011	For everyone who exalts themselves will be humbled, and everyone who humbles themselves will be exalted.’
042	LUK	014	012	Then Jesus went on to say to the man who had invited him, ‘When you give a breakfast or a dinner, do not ask your friends, or your brothers or sisters, or your relatives, or rich neighbours, because they might invite you in return, and so you should be repaid.
042	LUK	014	013	No, when you entertain, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind;
042	LUK	014	014	and then you will be happy indeed, since they cannot reward you; for you will be rewarded at the resurrection of the just.’
042	LUK	014	015	One of the guests heard what he said and exclaimed, ‘Happy will be the person who will eat bread in the kingdom of God!’
042	LUK	014	016	But Jesus said to him, ‘A man was once giving a great dinner. He invited many people,
042	LUK	014	017	and sent his servant, when it was time for the dinner, to say to those who had been invited “Come, for everything is now ready.”
042	LUK	014	018	They all with one accord began to ask to be excused. The first said to the servant “I have bought a field and am obliged to go and look at it. I must ask you to consider me excused.”
042	LUK	014	019	The next said “I have bought five pairs of bullocks, and I am on my way to try them. I must ask you to consider me excused”;
042	LUK	014	020	while the next said “I am just married, and for that reason I am unable to come.”
042	LUK	014	021	On his return the servant told his master all these answers. Then in anger the owner of the house said to his servant “Go out at once into the streets and alleys of the town, and bring in here the poor, and the crippled, and the blind, and the lame.”
042	LUK	014	022	Presently the servant said “Sir, your order has been carried out, and still there is room.”
042	LUK	014	023	“Go out,” the master said, “into the roads and hedgerows, and make people come in, so that my house may be filled;
042	LUK	014	024	for I tell you all that not one of those people who were invited will taste my dinner.”’
042	LUK	014	025	One day, when great crowds of people were walking with Jesus, he turned and said to them,
042	LUK	014	026	‘If any one comes to me and does not hate their father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brothers, and sisters, yes and even their life, he can be no disciple of mine.
042	LUK	014	027	Whoever does not carry their own cross, and walk in my steps, can be no disciple of mine.
042	LUK	014	028	Why, which of you, when you want to build a tower, does not first sit down and reckon the cost, to see if you have enough to complete it? –
042	LUK	014	029	Otherwise, if you have laid the foundation and are not able to finish it, everyone who sees it will laugh at you,
042	LUK	014	030	and say “Here is a person who began to build and was not able to finish!”
042	LUK	014	031	Or what king, when he is setting out to fight another king, does not first sit down and consider if with ten thousand men he is able to meet one who is coming against him with twenty thousand?
042	LUK	014	032	And if he cannot, then, while the other is still at a distance, he sends envoys and asks for terms of peace.
042	LUK	014	033	And so with everyone of you who does not bid farewell to all you have – you cannot be a disciple of mine.
042	LUK	014	034	Yes, salt is good; but, if the salt itself should lose its strength, what will be used to season it?
042	LUK	014	035	It is not fit either for the land or for the manure heap. People throw it away. Let those who have ears to hear with hear!’
042	LUK	015	001	The tax collectors and the outcasts were all drawing near to Jesus to listen to him;
042	LUK	015	002	but the Pharisees and the teachers of the Law found fault. ‘This man always welcomes outcasts, and takes meals with them!’ they complained.
042	LUK	015	003	So Jesus told them this parable –
042	LUK	015	004	‘Who among you who has a hundred sheep, and has lost one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine out in the open country, and go after the lost sheep until he finds it?
042	LUK	015	005	And, when he has found it, he puts it on his shoulders rejoicing;
042	LUK	015	006	and, on reaching home, he calls his friends and his neighbours together, and says “Come and rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost.”
042	LUK	015	007	So, I tell you, there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one outcast who repents, than over ninety-nine religious people, who have no need to repent.
042	LUK	015	008	Or again, what woman who has ten silver coins, if she loses one of them, does not light a lamp, and sweep the house, and search carefully until she finds it?
042	LUK	015	009	And, when she has found it, she calls her friends and neighbours together, and says “Come and rejoice with me, for I have found the coin which I lost.”
042	LUK	015	010	So, I tell you, there is rejoicing in the presence of God’s angels over one outcast who repents.’
042	LUK	015	011	Then Jesus continued, ‘A man had two sons;
042	LUK	015	012	and the younger of them said to his father “Father, give me my share of the inheritance.” So the father divided the property between them.
042	LUK	015	013	A few days later the younger son got together all that he had, and went away into a distant land; and there he squandered his inheritance by leading a dissolute life.
042	LUK	015	014	After he has spent all that he had, there was a severe famine through all that country, and he began to be in actual want.
042	LUK	015	015	So he went and engaged himself to one of the people of that country, who sent him into his fields to tend pigs.
042	LUK	015	016	He even longed to satisfy his hunger with the bean-pods on which the pigs were feeding; and no one gave him anything.
042	LUK	015	017	But, when he came to himself, he said “How many of my father’s hired servants have more bread than they can eat, while here am I starving to death!
042	LUK	015	018	I will get up and go to my father, and say to him ‘Father, I sinned against heaven and against you;
042	LUK	015	019	I am no longer fit to be called your son; make me one of your hired servants.’”
042	LUK	015	020	And he got up and went to his father. But, while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was deeply moved; he ran and threw his arms round his neck and kissed him.
042	LUK	015	021	“Father,” the son said, “I sinned against heaven and against you; I am no longer fit to be called your son; make me one of your hired servants.”
042	LUK	015	022	But the father turned to his servants and said “Be quick and fetch a robe – the very best – and put it on him; give him a ring for his finger and sandals for his feet;
042	LUK	015	023	and bring the fattened calf and kill it, and let us eat and make merry;
042	LUK	015	024	for here is my son who was dead, and is alive again, was lost, and is found.” So they began making merry.
042	LUK	015	025	Meanwhile the elder son was out in the fields; but, on coming home, when he got near the house, he heard music and dancing,
042	LUK	015	026	and he called one of the servants and asked what it all meant.
042	LUK	015	027	“Your brother has come back,” the servant told him, “and your father has killed the fattened calf, because he has him back safe and sound.”
042	LUK	015	028	This made him angry, and he would not go in. But his father came out and begged him to do so.
042	LUK	015	029	“No,” he said to his father, “look at all the years I have been serving you, without ever once disobeying you, and yet you have never given me even a young goat, so that I might have a party with my friends.
042	LUK	015	030	But, no sooner has this son of yours come, who has eaten up your property in the company of prostitutes, than you have killed the fattened calf for him.”
042	LUK	015	031	“Child,” the father answered, “you are always with me, and everything that I have is yours.
042	LUK	015	032	But how could we not celebrate and rejoice? Here is your brother who was dead and is alive, who was lost and is found.”’
042	LUK	016	001	Jesus said to his disciples, ‘There was a rich man who had a steward; and this steward was maliciously accused to him of wasting his estate.
042	LUK	016	002	So the master called him and said “What is this that I hear about you? Give in your accounts, for you cannot act as steward any longer.”
042	LUK	016	003	“What am I to do,” the steward asked himself, “now that my master is taking the steward’s place away from me? I have not strength to dig, and I am ashamed to beg.
042	LUK	016	004	I know what I will do, so that, as soon as I am turned out of my stewardship, people may welcome me into their homes.”
042	LUK	016	005	One by one he called up his master’s debtors. “How much do you owe my master?” he asked of the first.
042	LUK	016	006	“Four hundred and forty gallons of oil,” answered the man. “Here is your agreement,” he said; “sit down at once and make it two hundred and twenty.”
042	LUK	016	007	And you, the steward said to the next, “how much do you owe?” “Seventy quarters of wheat,” he replied. “Here is your agreement,” the steward said; “make it fifty-six.”
042	LUK	016	008	His master complimented this dishonest steward on the shrewdness of his action. And indeed men of the world are shrewder in dealing with their fellow men than those who have the light.
042	LUK	016	009	And I say to you “Win friends for yourselves with your dishonest money,” so that, when it comes to an end, there may be a welcome for you into the Eternal Home.
042	LUK	016	010	The person who is trustworthy in the smallest matter is trustworthy in a great one also; and the person who is dishonest in the smallest matter is dishonest in a great one also.
042	LUK	016	011	So, if you have proved untrustworthy with the dishonest money, who will trust you with the true?
042	LUK	016	012	And, if you have proved untrustworthy with what does not belong to us, who will give you what is really our own?
042	LUK	016	013	No servant can serve two masters, for, either they will hate one and love the other, or else they will attach themselves to one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money.’
042	LUK	016	014	All this was said within hearing of the Pharisees, who were lovers of money, and they began to sneer at Jesus.
042	LUK	016	015	‘You,’ said Jesus, ‘are the ones who justify themselves before the world, but God can read your hearts; and what is highly esteemed among people may be an abomination in the sight of God.
042	LUK	016	016	The Law and the prophets sufficed until the time of John. Since then the good news of the kingdom of God has been told, and everybody has been forcing their way into it.
042	LUK	016	017	It would be easier for the heavens and the earth to disappear than for one stroke of a letter in the Law to be lost.
042	LUK	016	018	Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman is an adulterer, and the man who marries a divorced woman is an adulterer.
042	LUK	016	019	There was once a rich man, who dressed in purple robes and fine linen, and feasted every day in great splendour.
042	LUK	016	020	Near his gateway there had been laid a beggar named Lazarus, who was covered with sores,
042	LUK	016	021	and who longed to satisfy his hunger with what fell from the rich man’s table. Even the dogs came and licked his sores.
042	LUK	016	022	After a time the beggar died, and was taken by the angels to be with Abraham. The rich man also died and was buried.
042	LUK	016	023	In Hades he looked up in his torment, and saw Abraham at a distance and Lazarus at his side.
042	LUK	016	024	So he called out “Pity me, Father Abraham, and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, for I am suffering agony in this flame.”
042	LUK	016	025	“Child,” answered Abraham, “remember that you in your lifetime received what you thought desirable, just as Lazarus received what was not desirable; but now he has his consolation here, while you are suffering agony.
042	LUK	016	026	And not only that, but between you and us there lies a great chasm, so that those who wish to pass from here to you cannot, nor can they cross from there to us.”
042	LUK	016	027	“Then, Father,” he said, “I beg you to send Lazarus to my father’s house
042	LUK	016	028	where I have five brothers, to warn them, so that they will not also come to this place of torture.”
042	LUK	016	029	“They have the writings of Moses and the prophets,” replied Abraham. “Let them listen to them.”
042	LUK	016	030	“But, Father Abraham,” he urged, “if someone from the dead were to go to them, they would repent.”
042	LUK	016	031	“If they do not listen to Moses and the prophets,” answered Abraham, “they will not be persuaded, even if someone were to rise from the dead.”’
042	LUK	017	001	Jesus said to his disciples, ‘It is inevitable that there should be temptations but sorrow awaits the person who does the tempting!
042	LUK	017	002	It would be better for them if they had been flung into the sea with a millstone round their neck, rather than that they should cause even one of these little ones to stumble.
042	LUK	017	003	Be on your guard! If your brother or sister does wrong, rebuke them; but if they repent, forgive them.
042	LUK	017	004	Even if they wrong you seven times a day, but turns to you every time and says “I am sorry,” you must forgive them.’
042	LUK	017	005	‘Give us more faith,’ said the apostles to the Master;
042	LUK	017	006	but the Master said, ‘If your faith were only like a mustard seed, you could say to this mulberry tree “Be uprooted and planted in the sea,” and it would obey you.
042	LUK	017	007	Which of you, if he had a servant ploughing, or tending the sheep, would say to him, when he came in from the fields, “Come at once and take your place at the table,”
042	LUK	017	008	Instead of saying “Prepare my dinner, and then make yourself ready and serve me while I am eating and drinking, and after that you will eat and drink yourself”?
042	LUK	017	009	Does he feel grateful to his servant for doing what he is told?
042	LUK	017	010	And so with you – when you have done all that you have been told, still say “We are but useless servants; we have done no more than we ought to have done.”’
042	LUK	017	011	On the way to Jerusalem Jesus passed between Samaria and Galilee.
042	LUK	017	012	As he was entering a village, ten lepers met him.
042	LUK	017	013	Standing still, some distance off, they called out loudly, ‘Jesus! Sir! Pity us!’
042	LUK	017	014	When Jesus saw them, he said, ‘Go and show yourselves to the priest.’ And, as they were on their way, they were made clean.
042	LUK	017	015	One of them, finding he was cured, came back, praising God loudly,
042	LUK	017	016	and threw himself on his face at Jesus’ feet, thanking him for what he had done; and this man was a Samaritan.
042	LUK	017	017	‘Were not all the ten made clean? exclaimed Jesus. But the nine – where are they?
042	LUK	017	018	Were there none to come back and praise God except this foreigner?
042	LUK	017	019	Get up,’ he said to him, ‘and go on your way. Your faith has delivered you.’
042	LUK	017	020	Being once asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God was to come, Jesus answered, ‘The kingdom of God does not come in a way that can be seen,
042	LUK	017	021	nor will people say “Look, here it is!” or “There it is!”; for the kingdom of God is within you!
042	LUK	017	022	The day will come,’ he said to his disciples, ‘when you will long to see but one of the days of the Son of Man, and will not see it.
042	LUK	017	023	People will say to you “There he is!” Or “Here he is!” Do not go and follow them.
042	LUK	017	024	For, just as lightning will lighten and flare from one side of the heavens to the other, so will it be with the Son of Man.
042	LUK	017	025	But first he must undergo much suffering, and he must be rejected by the present generation.
042	LUK	017	026	As it was in the days of Noah, so will it be again in the days of the Son of Man.
042	LUK	017	027	They were eating and drinking and marrying and being married, up to the very day on which Noah entered the ark, and then the flood came and destroyed them all.
042	LUK	017	028	So, too, in the days of Lot. People were eating, drinking, buying, selling, planting, building;
042	LUK	017	029	but, on the very day on which Lot came out of Sodom, it rained fire and sulphur from the skies and destroyed them all.
042	LUK	017	030	It will be the same on the day on which the Son of Man reveals himself.
042	LUK	017	031	On that day, if a person is on their house-top and their goods in the house, they must not go down to get them; nor again must one who is on the farm turn back.
042	LUK	017	032	Remember Lot’s wife.
042	LUK	017	033	Whoever is eager to get the most out of their life will lose it; but whoever will lose it will preserve it.
042	LUK	017	034	On that night, I tell you, of two people on the same bed, one will be taken and the other left;
042	LUK	017	035	of two women grinding grain together, one will be taken and the other left.’
042	LUK	017	037	‘Where will it be, Master?’ asked the disciples. ‘Where there is a body,’ said Jesus, ‘there will the vultures flock.’
042	LUK	018	001	Jesus told his disciples a parable to show them that they should always pray and never despair.
042	LUK	018	002	‘There was,’ he said, ‘in a certain town a judge, who had no fear of God nor regard for people.
042	LUK	018	003	In the same town there was a widow who went to him again and again, and said “Grant me justice against my opponent.”
042	LUK	018	004	For a time the judge refused, but afterwards he said to himself “Although I am without fear of God or regard for people,
042	LUK	018	005	yet, as this widow is so troublesome, I will grant her justice, to stop her from plaguing me with her endless visits.”’
042	LUK	018	006	Then the Master added, ‘Listen to what this iniquitous judge says!
042	LUK	018	007	And God – won’t he see that his own people, who cry to him night and day, have justice done them – though he holds his hand?
042	LUK	018	008	He will, I tell you, give them justice soon enough! Yet, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on earth?’
042	LUK	018	009	Another time, speaking to people who were satisfied that they were religious, and who regarded everyone else with scorn, Jesus told this parable –
042	LUK	018	010	‘Two men went up into the Temple Courts to pray. One was a Pharisee and the other a tax-gatherer.
042	LUK	018	011	The Pharisee stood forward and began praying to himself in this way – “God, I thank you that I am not like other men – thieves, rogues, adulterers – or even like this tax-gatherer.
042	LUK	018	012	I fast twice a week, and give a tenth of everything I get to God.”
042	LUK	018	013	Meanwhile the tax-gatherer stood at a distance, not venturing even to raise his eyes to heaven, but he kept striking his breast and saying “God, have mercy on me, a sinner.”
042	LUK	018	014	This man, I tell you, went home pardoned, rather than the other. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, while everyone who humbles himself will be exalted.’
042	LUK	018	015	Some of the people were bringing even their babies to Jesus, for him to touch them; but, when the disciples saw it, they began to find fault with those who had brought them.
042	LUK	018	016	Jesus, however, called the little children to him. ‘Let the little children come to me,’ he said, ‘and do not hinder them, for it is to the childlike that the kingdom of God belongs.
042	LUK	018	017	I tell you, unless a man receives the kingdom of God like a child, he will not enter it at all.’
042	LUK	018	018	And one of the leaders asked Jesus this question – ‘Good teacher, what must I do if I am to gain eternal life?’
042	LUK	018	019	‘Why do you call me good?’ answered Jesus. ‘No one is good but God.
042	LUK	018	020	You know the commandments – Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not say what is false about others, Honour your father and your mother.’
042	LUK	018	021	‘I have observed all these,’ he replied, ‘from childhood.’
042	LUK	018	022	Hearing this, Jesus said to him, ‘There is one thing still lacking in you; sell everything that you have, and distribute to the poor, and you will have wealth in heaven; then come and follow me.’
042	LUK	018	023	But the man became greatly distressed on hearing this, for he was extremely rich.
042	LUK	018	024	Seeing this, Jesus said to his disciples, ‘How hard it is for the wealthy to enter the kingdom of God!
042	LUK	018	025	It is easier, indeed, for a camel to get through a needle’s eye than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God!’
042	LUK	018	026	‘Then who can be saved?’ asked those who heard this.
042	LUK	018	027	But Jesus said, ‘What is impossible with people is possible with God.’
042	LUK	018	028	‘But we,’ said Peter, ‘we left what belonged to us and followed you.’
042	LUK	018	029	‘I tell you,’ he answered, ‘that there is no one who has left house, or wife, or brothers, or parents, or children, for the sake of the kingdom of God,
042	LUK	018	030	who will not receive many times as much in the present, and in the age that is coming eternal life.’
042	LUK	018	031	Gathering the Twelve round him, Jesus said to them, ‘Listen! We are going up to Jerusalem; and there everything that is written in the prophets will be done to the Son of Man.
042	LUK	018	032	For he will be given up to the Gentiles, mocked, insulted and spat on;
042	LUK	018	033	they will scourge him, and then put him to death; and on the third day he will rise again.’
042	LUK	018	034	The apostles did not comprehend any of this. His meaning was unintelligible to them and they did not understand what he was saying.
042	LUK	018	035	As Jesus was getting near Jericho, a blind man was sitting by the roadside, begging.
042	LUK	018	036	Hearing a crowd going by, the man asked what was the matter;
042	LUK	018	037	and, when people told him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing,
042	LUK	018	038	he shouted out, ‘Jesus, Son of David, take pity on me!’
042	LUK	018	039	Those who were in front kept telling him to be quiet, but he continued to call out the louder, ‘Son of David, take pity on me!’
042	LUK	018	040	Then Jesus stopped and ordered the man to be brought to him. And, when he had come close up to him, Jesus asked him,
042	LUK	018	041	‘What do you want me to do for you?’ ‘Master,’ he said, ‘I want to recover my sight.’
042	LUK	018	042	And Jesus said, ‘Recover your sight, your faith has delivered you.’
042	LUK	018	043	Instantly he recovered his sight, and began to follow Jesus, praising God. And all the people, on seeing it, gave glory to God.
042	LUK	019	001	Jesus entered Jericho and made his way through the town.
042	LUK	019	002	There was a man there, known by the name of Zacchaeus, who was a senior tax collector and a rich man.
042	LUK	019	003	He tried to see what Jesus was like; but, being short, he was unable to do so because of the crowd.
042	LUK	019	004	So he ran on ahead and climbed into a mulberry tree to see Jesus, for he knew that he must pass that way.
042	LUK	019	005	When Jesus came to the place, he looked up and said to him, ‘Zacchaeus, be quick and come down, for I must stop at your house today.’
042	LUK	019	006	So Zacchaeus got down quickly, and joyfully welcomed him.
042	LUK	019	007	On seeing this, everyone began to complain, ‘He has gone to stay with a man who is an outcast.’
042	LUK	019	008	But Zacchaeus stood forward and said to the Master, ‘Listen, Master! I will give half my property to the poor, and, if I have defrauded anyone of anything, I will give him back four times as much.’
042	LUK	019	009	‘Salvation has come to this house today,’ answered Jesus, ‘for even this man is a son of Abraham.
042	LUK	019	010	The Son of Man has come to search for those who are lost and to save them.’
042	LUK	019	011	As the people were listening to this, Jesus went on to tell them a parable. He did so because he was near Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God was going to be proclaimed at once.
042	LUK	019	012	He said, ‘A nobleman once went to a distant country to receive his appointment to a kingdom and then return.
042	LUK	019	013	He called ten of his servants and gave them ten pounds of silver each, and told them to trade with them during his absence.
042	LUK	019	014	But his subjects hated him and sent envoys after him to say “We will not have this man as our king.”
042	LUK	019	015	On his return, after having been appointed king, he directed that the servants to whom he had given his money should be summoned, so that he might learn what amount of trade they had done.
042	LUK	019	016	The first came up, and said “Sir, your ten pounds have made a hundred.”
042	LUK	019	017	“Well done, good servant!” exclaimed the master. “As you have proved trustworthy in a very small matter, I appoint you governor over ten towns.”
042	LUK	019	018	When the second came, he said “Your ten pounds, Sir, have produced fifty.”
042	LUK	019	019	So the master said to him “And you I appoint over five towns.”
042	LUK	019	020	Another servant also came and said “Sir, here are your ten pounds; I have kept them put away in a handkerchief.
042	LUK	019	021	For I was afraid of you, because you are a stern man. You take what you have not planted, and reap what you have not sown.”
042	LUK	019	022	The master answered “Out of your own mouth I judge you, you worthless servant. You knew that I am a stern man, that I take what I have not planted, and reap what I have not sown?
042	LUK	019	023	Then why didn’t you put my money into a bank? And I, on my return, could have claimed it with interest.
042	LUK	019	024	Take away from him the ten pounds,” he said to those standing by, “and give them to the one who has the hundred.”
042	LUK	019	025	“But, Sir,” they said, “he has a hundred pounds already!”
042	LUK	019	026	“I tell you,” he answered, “that, to him who has, more will be given, but, from him who has nothing, even what he has will be taken away.
042	LUK	019	027	But as for my enemies, these men who would not have me as their king, bring them here and put them to death in my presence.”’
042	LUK	019	028	After saying this, Jesus went on in front, going up to Jerusalem.
042	LUK	019	029	It was when Jesus had almost reached Bethphage and Bethany, near the Mount of Olives, that he sent on two of the disciples.
042	LUK	019	030	‘Go to the village facing us,’ he said, ‘and, when you get there, you will find a foal tethered, which no one has yet ridden; untie it and lead it here.
042	LUK	019	031	And, if anybody asks you “Why are you untying it?”, you are to say this – “The Master wants it.”’
042	LUK	019	032	So the two who were sent went and found it as Jesus had told them.
042	LUK	019	033	While they were untying the foal, the owners asked them – ‘Why are you untying the foal?’
042	LUK	019	034	And the two disciples answered – ‘The Master wants it.’
042	LUK	019	035	Then they led it back to Jesus, and threw their cloaks on the foal and put Jesus on it.
042	LUK	019	036	As he went along, the people kept spreading their cloaks in the road.
042	LUK	019	037	When he had almost reached the place where the road led down the Mount of Olives, everyone of the many disciples began in their joy to praise God loudly for all the miracles that they had seen:
042	LUK	019	038	‘Blessed is He who comes – our king – in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven, and glory on high.’
042	LUK	019	039	Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him, ‘Teacher, restrain your disciples.’
042	LUK	019	040	But Jesus answered, ‘I tell you that if they are silent, the stones will call out.’
042	LUK	019	041	When he drew near, on seeing the city, he wept over it, and said,
042	LUK	019	042	‘If only you had known, while yet there was time – even you – the things that make for peace! But now they have been hidden from your sight.
042	LUK	019	043	For a time is coming when your enemies will surround you with earthworks, and encircle you, and hem you in on all sides;
042	LUK	019	044	they will trample you down and your children within you, and they will not leave in you one stone on another, because you did not know the time of your visitation.’
042	LUK	019	045	Jesus went into the Temple Courts and began to drive out those who were selling,
042	LUK	019	046	saying as he did so, ‘Scripture says – “My house will be a house of prayer”; but you have made it a den of robbers.’
042	LUK	019	047	Jesus continued to teach each day in the Temple Courts; but the chief priests and teachers of the Law were eager to take his life, and so also were the leaders of the people.
042	LUK	019	048	Yet they could not see what to do, for the people all hung on his words.
042	LUK	020	001	On one of these days, when Jesus was teaching the people in the Temple Courts and telling the good news, the chief priests and the teachers of the Law, joined by the elders, confronted him,
042	LUK	020	002	and addressing him, said, ‘Tell us what authority you have to do these things. Who is it who has given you this authority?’
042	LUK	020	003	‘I, too,’ said Jesus in reply, ‘will ask you one question. Give me an answer to it.
042	LUK	020	004	It is about John’s baptism – was it of divine or of human origin?’
042	LUK	020	005	But they began arguing together, ‘If we say “divine,” he will say “Why didn’t you believe him?”
042	LUK	020	006	But, if we say “human,” the people will all stone us, for they are persuaded that John was a prophet.’
042	LUK	020	007	So they answered that they did not know its origin.
042	LUK	020	008	‘Then I,’ said Jesus, ‘refuse to tell you what authority I have to do these things.’
042	LUK	020	009	But Jesus began to tell the people this parable – ‘A man once planted a vineyard, and then let it out to tenants, and went abroad for a long while.
042	LUK	020	010	At the proper time he sent a servant to the tenants, so that they could give him a share of the produce of the vineyard. The tenants, however, beat him and sent him away empty-handed.
042	LUK	020	011	The owner afterwards sent another servant; but the tenants beat and insulted this man too, and sent him away empty-handed.
042	LUK	020	012	He sent a third; but they wounded this man also, and threw him outside.
042	LUK	020	013	“What should I do?” said the owner of the vineyard. “I will send my son, who is very dear to me. Perhaps they will respect him.”
042	LUK	020	014	But, on seeing him, the tenants consulted with one another. “Here is the heir!” they said. “Let us kill him, and then the inheritance will become ours.”
042	LUK	020	015	So they threw him outside the vineyard and killed him. Now what will the owner of the vineyard do to them?
042	LUK	020	016	He will come and put those tenants to death, and will let the vineyard to others.’ ‘Heaven forbid!’ they exclaimed when they heard it.
042	LUK	020	017	But Jesus looked at them and said, ‘What then is the meaning of this passage? – “The stone which the builders despised has now itself become the cornerstone.”
042	LUK	020	018	Everyone who falls on that stone will be dashed to pieces, while anyone on whom it falls – it will scatter him as dust.’
042	LUK	020	019	After this the teachers of the Law and the chief priest were eager to lay hands on Jesus then and there, but they were afraid of the people; for they saw that it was at them that he had aimed this parable.
042	LUK	020	020	Having watched their opportunity, they afterwards sent some spies, who pretended to be good men, to catch Jesus in the course of conversation, and so enable them to give him up to the Governor’s jurisdiction and authority.
042	LUK	020	021	These spies asked Jesus a question. They said, ‘Teacher, we know that you are right in what you say and teach, and that you do not take any account of a person’s position, but teach the way of God honestly;
042	LUK	020	022	are we right in paying tribute to the Emperor or not?’
042	LUK	020	023	Seeing through their deceitfulness, Jesus said to them,
042	LUK	020	024	‘Show me a coin. Whose head and title are on it?’
042	LUK	020	025	‘The Emperor’s,’ they said; and Jesus replied, ‘Well then, pay to the Emperor what belongs to the Emperor, and to God what belongs to God.’
042	LUK	020	026	They could not object to this answer before the people; and, in their wonder at his reply, they held their tongues.
042	LUK	020	027	Presently there came up some Sadducees, who maintain that there is no resurrection. Their question was this –
042	LUK	020	028	‘Teacher, Moses laid down for us in his writings that – “Should a man’s married brother die, and should he be childless, the man should take the widow as his wife, and raise up a family for his brother.”
042	LUK	020	029	Well, there were once seven brothers; of whom the eldest, after taking a wife, died childless.
042	LUK	020	030	The second and third brothers both took her as their wife;
042	LUK	020	031	and so, too, did all seven – dying without children.
042	LUK	020	032	The woman herself was the last to die.
042	LUK	020	033	About the woman, then – at the resurrection, whose wife is she to be, all seven brothers having had her as their wife?’
042	LUK	020	034	‘The men and women of this world,’ said Jesus, ‘marry and are given in marriage;
042	LUK	020	035	but, for those who are thought worthy to attain to that other world and the resurrection from the dead, there is no marrying or being married,
042	LUK	020	036	nor indeed can they die again, for they are like angels and, having shared in the resurrection, they are God’s children.
042	LUK	020	037	As to the fact that the dead rise, even Moses indicated that, in the passage about the Bush, when he calls the Lord – “The God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.”
042	LUK	020	038	Now he is not God of dead people, but of living. For in his sight all are alive.’
042	LUK	020	039	‘Well said, teacher!’ exclaimed some of the teachers of the Law,
042	LUK	020	040	for they did not venture to question him any further.
042	LUK	020	041	But Jesus said to them, ‘How is it that people say that the Christ is to be David’s son?
042	LUK	020	042	For David, in the book of Psalms, says himself – “The Lord said to my lord: Sit at my right hand,
042	LUK	020	043	until I put your enemies as a stool for your feet.”
042	LUK	020	044	David, then, calls him “lord,” so how is he David’s son?’
042	LUK	020	045	While all the people were listening, Jesus said to the disciples,
042	LUK	020	046	‘Be on your guard against the teachers of the Law, who delight to walk about in long robes, and like to be greeted in the streets with respect, and to have the best seats in the synagogues, and places of honour at dinner.
042	LUK	020	047	These are the men who rob widows of their houses, and make a pretence of saying long prayers. Their sentence will be all the heavier.’
042	LUK	021	001	Looking up, Jesus saw the rich people putting their gifts into the chests for the Temple offerings.
042	LUK	021	002	He saw, too, a widow in poor circumstances putting two small coins into them.
042	LUK	021	003	‘I tell you’, he said ‘that this poor widow has put in more than all the others;
042	LUK	021	004	for everyone else here put in something from what he had to spare, while she, in her need, has put in all she had to live on.’
042	LUK	021	005	When some of them spoke about the Temple being decorated with beautiful stones and offerings, Jesus said,
042	LUK	021	006	‘As for these things that you are looking at, a time is coming when not one stone will be left on another here. Every one will be thrown down.’
042	LUK	021	007	So the disciples questioned Jesus, ‘But, teacher, when will this happen? And what sign will there be when this is near?’
042	LUK	021	008	And Jesus said, ‘See that you are not led astray; for many will take my name, and come saying “I am He,” and “The time is close at hand.” Do not follow them.
042	LUK	021	009	And, when you hear of wars and disturbances, do not be terrified, for these things must occur first; but the end will not be at once.’
042	LUK	021	010	Then he said to them, ‘Nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom,
042	LUK	021	011	and there will be great earthquakes, and plagues and famines in various places, and there will be terrible appearances and signs in the heavens.
042	LUK	021	012	Before all this, they will lay hands on you and persecute you, and they will betray you to synagogues and put you in prison, when you will be brought before kings and governors for the sake of my name.
042	LUK	021	013	Then will be your opportunity of witnessing for me.
042	LUK	021	014	Make up your minds, therefore, not to prepare your defence;
042	LUK	021	015	for I will myself give you words, and a wisdom which all your opponents together will be unable to resist or defy.
042	LUK	021	016	You will be betrayed even by your parents and brothers and sisters and relatives and friends, and they will cause some of you to be put to death,
042	LUK	021	017	and you will be hated by everyone because of me my name.
042	LUK	021	018	Yet not a single hair of your heads will be lost!
042	LUK	021	019	By your endurance you will win yourselves life.
042	LUK	021	020	As soon, however, as you see Jerusalem surrounded by armed camps, then you may know that the hour of her desecration is at hand.
042	LUK	021	021	Then those of you who are in Judea must take refuge in the mountains, those who are in Jerusalem must leave at once, and those who are in the country places must not go into it.
042	LUK	021	022	For these are to be the days of vengeance, when all that scripture says will be fulfilled.
042	LUK	021	023	Alas for pregnant women, and for those who are nursing infants in those days! For there will be great suffering in the land, and anger against this people.
042	LUK	021	024	They will fall by the edge of the sword, and will be taken prisoners to every land, and Jerusalem will be under the heel of the Gentiles, until their day is over – as it will be.
042	LUK	021	025	There will be signs, too, in the sun and moon and stars, and on the earth despair among the nations, in their dismay at the roar of the sea and the surge.
042	LUK	021	026	People’s hearts will fail them through dread of what is coming upon the world; for the forces of the heavens will be convulsed.
042	LUK	021	027	Then will be seen the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.
042	LUK	021	028	And, when these things begin to occur, look upwards and lift your heads, for your deliverance will be at hand.’
042	LUK	021	029	Then he taught them a lesson, saying – ‘Look at the fig tree and all the other trees.
042	LUK	021	030	As soon as they shoot, you know, as you look at them, without being told, that summer is near.
042	LUK	021	031	And so may you, as soon as you see these things happening, know that the kingdom of God is near.
042	LUK	021	032	I tell you that even the present generation will not pass away until all has taken place.
042	LUK	021	033	The heavens and the earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.
042	LUK	021	034	Be on your guard or your minds will become dulled by debauches or drunkenness or the anxieties of life, and “that day” will close on you suddenly like a trap.
042	LUK	021	035	For it will come on all who are living upon the face of the whole earth.
042	LUK	021	036	Be on the watch at all times, and pray that you may have strength to escape all that is destined to happen, and to stand in the presence of the Son of Man.’
042	LUK	021	037	During the days, Jesus continued to teach in the Temple Courts, but he went out and spent the nights on the hill called the “Mount of Olives.”
042	LUK	021	038	And all the people would get up early in the morning and come to listen to him in the Temple Courts.
042	LUK	022	001	The feast of the unleavened bread, known as the Passover, was near.
042	LUK	022	002	The chief priest and the teachers of the Law were looking for an opportunity of destroying Jesus, for they were afraid of the people.
042	LUK	022	003	Now Satan took possession of Judas, who was known as Iscariot, and who belonged to the Twelve;
042	LUK	022	004	and he went and discussed with the chief priests and officers in charge at the Temple the best way of betraying Jesus to them.
042	LUK	022	005	They were glad of this, and agreed to pay him.
042	LUK	022	006	So Judas assented, and looked for an opportunity to betray Jesus to them, in the absence of a crowd.
042	LUK	022	007	When the day of the Festival of the unleavened bread came, on which the Passover lambs had to be killed,
042	LUK	022	008	Jesus sent forward Peter and John, saying to them, ‘Go and make preparations for our eating the Passover.’
042	LUK	022	009	‘Where do you wish us to make preparations?’ they asked.
042	LUK	022	010	‘Listen,’ he answered, ‘when you have reached the city, a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you; follow him into whatever house he enters;
042	LUK	022	011	and you will say to the owner of the house “The teacher says to you – Where is the room where I am to eat the Passover with my disciples?”
042	LUK	022	012	The man will show you a large upstairs room, set out; there make preparations.’
042	LUK	022	013	So Peter and John went on, and found everything just as Jesus had told them, and they prepared the Passover.
042	LUK	022	014	When the time came, Jesus took his place at the table, and the apostles with him.
042	LUK	022	015	‘I have most earnestly wished,’ he said, ‘to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.
042	LUK	022	016	For I tell you that I will not eat it again, until it has had its fulfilment in the kingdom of God.’
042	LUK	022	017	Then, on receiving a cup, after saying the thanksgiving, he said, ‘Take this and share it among you.
042	LUK	022	018	For I tell you that I will not, after today, drink of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God has come.’
042	LUK	022	019	Then Jesus took some bread, and, after saying the thanksgiving, broke it and gave to them, with the words, ‘This is my body.
042	LUK	022	021	Yet see! The hand of the man who is betraying me is beside me on the table!
042	LUK	022	022	True, the Son of Man is passing, by the way ordained for him, yet alas for that man by whom he is being betrayed!’
042	LUK	022	023	Then they began questioning one another which of them it could be who was going to do this.
042	LUK	022	024	And a dispute arose among them as to which of them was to be regarded as the greatest.
042	LUK	022	025	Jesus, however, said, ‘The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their oppressors are styled “Benefactors.”
042	LUK	022	026	But with you it must not be so. No, let the greatest among you become like the youngest, and him who leads like him who serves.
042	LUK	022	027	Which is the greater – the master at the table or his servant? Is not it the master at the table? Yet I myself am among you as one who serves.
042	LUK	022	028	You are the men who have stood by me in my trials;
042	LUK	022	029	and, just as my Father has assigned me a kingdom, I assign you places,
042	LUK	022	030	so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and be seated on twelve thrones as judges of the twelve tribes of Israel.
042	LUK	022	031	Simon! Simon! listen. Satan demanded leave to sift you all like wheat,
042	LUK	022	032	but I prayed for you, Simon, that your faith should not fail. And you, when you have returned to me, are to strengthen the others.’
042	LUK	022	033	‘Master,’ said Peter, ‘with you I am ready to go both to prison and to death.’
042	LUK	022	034	‘I tell you, Peter,’ replied Jesus, ‘the cock will not crow today until you have disowned all knowledge of me three times.’
042	LUK	022	035	Then he said to them all, ‘When I sent you out as my messengers, without either purse, or bag, or sandals, were you in need of anything?’ ‘No; nothing,’ they answered.
042	LUK	022	036	‘Now, however,’ he said, ‘he who has a purse must take it and his bag as well; and he who has not must sell his cloak and buy a sword.
042	LUK	022	037	For, I tell you, that passage of scripture must be fulfilled in me, which says – “He was counted among the godless”; indeed all that refers to me is finding its fulfilment.’
042	LUK	022	038	‘Master,’ they exclaimed, ‘look, here are two swords!’ ‘Enough!’ said Jesus.
042	LUK	022	039	Jesus then went out, and made his way as usual to the Mount of Olives, followed by his disciples.
042	LUK	022	040	And, when he reached the spot, he said to them, ‘Pray that you may not fall into temptation.’
042	LUK	022	041	Then he withdrew about a stone’s throw, and knelt down and began to pray.
042	LUK	022	042	‘Father,’ he said, ‘if it is your pleasure, spare me this cup; only, not my will but yours be done.’
042	LUK	022	043	Presently there appeared to him an angel from heaven, who strengthened him.
042	LUK	022	044	And, as his anguish became intense, he prayed still more earnestly, while his sweat was like great drops of blood falling on the ground.
042	LUK	022	045	Then he rose from praying, and came to the disciples and found them sleeping for sorrow.
042	LUK	022	046	‘Why are you asleep?’ he asked them. ‘Rise and pray so that you don’t fall into temptation.’
042	LUK	022	047	While he was still speaking, a crowd appeared in sight, led by the man called Judas, who was one of the Twelve. Judas approached Jesus, to kiss him;
042	LUK	022	048	at which Jesus said to him, ‘Judas, is it by a kiss that you betray the Son of Man?’
042	LUK	022	049	But when those who were round Jesus saw what was going to happen, they exclaimed, ‘Master, should we use our swords?’
042	LUK	022	050	And one of them struck the high priest’s servant and cut off his right ear;
042	LUK	022	051	at which Jesus said, ‘Let me at least do this’; and, touching his ear, he healed the wound.
042	LUK	022	052	Then, turning to the chief priests and officers in charge at the Temple and the elders, who had come for him, he said, ‘Have you come out, as if after a robber, with swords and clubs?
042	LUK	022	053	When I was with you day after day in the Temple Courts, you did not lay hands on me; but now your time has come, and the power of darkness.’
042	LUK	022	054	Those who had taken Jesus prisoner took him away into the house of the high priest. Peter followed at a distance.
042	LUK	022	055	But, when they had lit a fire in the centre of the courtyard and had all sat down there, Peter seated himself in the middle of them.
042	LUK	022	056	Presently a maidservant saw him sitting near the blaze of the fire. She looked carefully at him and said, ‘Why, this man was one of his companions!’
042	LUK	022	057	But Peter denied it. ‘I do not know him,’ he replied.
042	LUK	022	058	A little while afterwards someone else – a man – saw him and said, ‘Why, you are one of them!’ ‘No,’ Peter said, ‘I am not.’
042	LUK	022	059	About an hour later another man declared positively, ‘This man also was certainly with him. Why, he is a Galilean!’
042	LUK	022	060	But Peter said, ‘I do not know what you are speaking about.’ Instantly, while he was still speaking, a cock crowed.
042	LUK	022	061	And the Master turned and looked at Peter; and Peter remembered the words that the Master had said to him – ‘Before a cock has crowed today, you will disown me three times’;
042	LUK	022	062	and he went outside and wept bitterly.
042	LUK	022	063	The men who held Jesus kept making sport of him and beating him.
042	LUK	022	064	They blindfolded him and then questioned him. ‘Now play the prophet,’ they said. ‘Who was it that struck you?’
042	LUK	022	065	And they heaped many other insults on him.
042	LUK	022	066	At daybreak the assembly of the elders of the people met – both the chief priests and the teachers of the Law – and took Jesus before their High Council.
042	LUK	022	067	‘If you are the Christ,’ they said, ‘tell us so.’ ‘If I tell you,’ replied Jesus, ‘you will not believe me;
042	LUK	022	068	and, if I question you, you will not answer.
042	LUK	022	069	But from this hour the Son of Man will be seated on the right hand of God Almighty.’
042	LUK	022	070	‘Are you, then, the Son of God?’ they all asked. ‘It is true,’ answered Jesus, ‘I am.’
042	LUK	022	071	At this they exclaimed, ‘Why do we want any more evidence? We have heard it ourselves from his own lips!’
042	LUK	023	001	Then they all rose in a body and led Jesus before Pilate.
042	LUK	023	002	And they began to accuse him, ‘This is a man whom we found misleading our people, preventing them from paying taxes to the Emperor, and giving out that he himself is “Christ, a king.”’
042	LUK	023	003	‘Are you the king of the Jews?’ Pilate asked him. ‘It is true,’ replied Jesus.
042	LUK	023	004	But Pilate, turning to the chief priests and the people, said, ‘I do not see anything to find fault with in this man.’
042	LUK	023	005	But they insisted, ‘He is stirring up the people by his teaching all through Judea; he began with Galilee and has now come here.’
042	LUK	023	006	Hearing this, Pilate asked if the man was a Galilean;
042	LUK	023	007	and, having satisfied himself that Jesus came under Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who also was at Jerusalem at the time.
042	LUK	023	008	When Herod saw Jesus, he was exceedingly pleased, for he had been wanting to see him for a long time, having heard a great deal about him; and he was hoping to see some sign given by him.
042	LUK	023	009	So he questioned him at some length, but Jesus made no reply.
042	LUK	023	010	Meanwhile the chief priests and the teachers of the Law stood by and vehemently accused him.
042	LUK	023	011	And Herod, with his soldiers, treated Jesus with scorn; he mocked him by throwing a gorgeous robe round him, and then sent him back to Pilate.
042	LUK	023	012	And Herod and Pilate became friends that very day, for before that there had been ill-will between them.
042	LUK	023	013	So Pilate summoned the chief priests, and the leading men, and the people,
042	LUK	023	014	and said to them, ‘You brought this man before me charged with misleading the people; and yet, for my part, though I examined him before you, I did not find this man to blame for any of the things of which you accuse him;
042	LUK	023	015	nor did Herod either; for he has sent him back to us. And, as a fact, he has not done anything deserving death;
042	LUK	023	016	so I will have him scourged, and then release him.’
042	LUK	023	018	But they began to shout as one man, ‘Kill this fellow, but release Barabbas for us.’
042	LUK	023	019	(Barabbas was a man who had been put in prison for a riot that had broken out in the city and for murder.)
042	LUK	023	020	Pilate, however, wanting to release Jesus, called to them again;
042	LUK	023	021	but they kept calling out, ‘Crucify, crucify him!’
042	LUK	023	022	‘Why, what harm has this man done?’ Pilate said to them for the third time. ‘I have found nothing in him for which he could be condemned to death. So I will have him scourged, and then release him.’
042	LUK	023	023	But they persisted in loudly demanding his crucifixion; and their clamour gained the day.
042	LUK	023	024	Pilate decided that their demand should be granted.
042	LUK	023	025	He released the man who had been put in prison for riot and murder, as they demanded, and gave Jesus up to be dealt with as they pleased.
042	LUK	023	026	And, as they were leading Jesus away, they laid hold of Simon from Cyrene, who was on his way in from the country, and they put the cross on his shoulders, for him to carry it behind Jesus.
042	LUK	023	027	There was a great crowd of people following him, many being women who were beating their breasts and wailing for him.
042	LUK	023	028	So Jesus turned and said to them, ‘Women of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.
042	LUK	023	029	A time, I tell you, is coming, when it will be said – “Happy are the women who are barren, and those who have never borne children or nursed them!”
042	LUK	023	030	At that time people will begin to say to the mountains “Fall on us,” and to the hills “Cover us.”
042	LUK	023	031	If what you see is done while the tree is green, what will happen when it is dry?’
042	LUK	023	032	There were two others also, criminals, led out to be executed with Jesus.
042	LUK	023	033	When they had reached the place called “The Skull,” there they crucified Jesus and the criminals, one on the right, and one on the left.
042	LUK	023	034	Then Jesus said, ‘Father, forgive them; they do not know what they are doing.’ His clothes they divided among them by casting lots.
042	LUK	023	035	Meanwhile the people stood looking on. Even the leading men said with a sneer, ‘He saved others, let him save himself, if he is God’s Christ, his chosen one.’
042	LUK	023	036	The soldiers, too, came up in mockery, bringing him common wine,
042	LUK	023	037	and saying as they did so, ‘If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself.’
042	LUK	023	038	Above him were the words – “THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.”
042	LUK	023	039	One of the criminals who were hanging beside Jesus railed at him. ‘Aren’t you the Christ? Save yourself and us,’ he said.
042	LUK	023	040	But the other rebuked him. ‘Haven’t you,’ he said, ‘any fear of God, now that you are under the same sentence?
042	LUK	023	041	And we justly so, for we are only reaping our deserts, but this man has not done anything wrong.
042	LUK	023	042	Jesus,’ he went on, ‘do not forget me when you have come to your kingdom.’
042	LUK	023	043	And Jesus answered, ‘I tell you, this very day you will be with me in Paradise.’
042	LUK	023	044	It was nearly midday, when a darkness came over the whole country, lasting until three in the afternoon,
042	LUK	023	045	the sun being eclipsed; and the Temple curtain was torn down the middle.
042	LUK	023	046	Then Jesus, with a loud cry, said, ‘Father, into your hands I commit my spirit.’ And with these words he expired.
042	LUK	023	047	The Roman centurion, on seeing what had happened, praised God, exclaiming, ‘This must have been a good man!’
042	LUK	023	048	All the people who had collected to see the sight watched what occurred, and then went home beating their breasts.
042	LUK	023	049	All the friends of Jesus had been standing at a distance, with the women who accompanied him from Galilee, watching all this.
042	LUK	023	050	Now there was a man of the name of Joseph, who was a member of the Council, and who bore a good and upright character.
042	LUK	023	051	(This man had not assented to the decision and action of the Council.) He belonged to Arimathea, a town in Judea, and lived in expectation of the kingdom of God.
042	LUK	023	052	He now went to see Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus;
042	LUK	023	053	and, when he had taken it down, he wrapped it in a linen sheet, and laid him in a tomb cut out of stone, in which no one had yet been buried.
042	LUK	023	054	It was the Preparation day, and just before the Sabbath began.
042	LUK	023	055	The women who had accompanied Jesus from Galilee followed, and saw the tomb and how the body of Jesus was laid,
042	LUK	023	056	and then went home, and prepared spices and perfumes. During the Sabbath they rested, as directed by the commandment.
042	LUK	024	001	But very early on the first day of the week they went to the tomb, taking with them the spices that they had prepared.
042	LUK	024	002	They found that the stone had been rolled away from the tomb;
042	LUK	024	003	and, on going into it, they could not find the body.
042	LUK	024	004	While they were at a loss to account for this, all at once two men stood beside them, in dazzling clothing.
042	LUK	024	005	But, when in their fear the women bowed their faces to the ground, the men said to them, ‘Why are you looking among the dead for him who is living?
042	LUK	024	006	Remember how he spoke to you before he left Galilee –
042	LUK	024	007	How he said that the Son of Man must be betrayed into the hands of wicked men, and be crucified, and rise again on the third day.’
042	LUK	024	008	Then they remembered the words of Jesus,
042	LUK	024	009	and, on returning from the tomb, they told all this to the Eleven and to all the rest.
042	LUK	024	010	There were Mary of Magdala, and Joanna, and Mary, the mother of James. The other women, too, spoke about this to the apostles.
042	LUK	024	011	What they said seemed to the apostles mere nonsense, and they did not believe them.
042	LUK	024	013	It happened that very day that two of the disciples were going to a village called Emmaus, which was about seven miles from Jerusalem,
042	LUK	024	014	talking together, as they went, about all that had just taken place.
042	LUK	024	015	While they were talking about these things and discussing them, Jesus himself came up and went on their way with them;
042	LUK	024	016	but their eyes were blinded so that they could not recognise him.
042	LUK	024	017	‘What is this that you are saying to each other as you walk along?’ Jesus asked. They stopped, with sad looks on their faces,
042	LUK	024	018	and then one of them, whose name was Cleopas, said to Jesus, ‘Are you staying by yourself at Jerusalem, that you have not heard of the things that have happened there within the last few days?’
042	LUK	024	019	‘What things do you mean?’ asked Jesus. ‘Why, about Jesus of Nazareth,’ they answered, ‘who, in the eyes of God and all the people, was a prophet, whose power was felt in both his words and actions;
042	LUK	024	020	and how the chief priests and our leading men gave him up to be sentenced to death, and afterwards crucified him.
042	LUK	024	021	But we were hoping that he was the Destined Deliverer of Israel; yes, and besides all this, it is now three days since these things occurred.
042	LUK	024	022	And what is more, some of the women among us have greatly astonished us. They went to the tomb at daybreak
042	LUK	024	023	And, not finding the body of Jesus there, came and told us that they had seen a vision of angels who told them that he was alive.
042	LUK	024	024	So some of our number went to the tomb and found everything just as the women had said, but they did not see Jesus.’
042	LUK	024	025	Then Jesus said to them, ‘Foolish men, slow to accept all that the prophets have said!
042	LUK	024	026	Was not the Christ bound to undergo this suffering before entering into his glory?’
042	LUK	024	027	Then, beginning with Moses and all the prophets, he explained to them all through the scriptures the passages that referred to himself.
042	LUK	024	028	When they got near the village to which they were walking, Jesus appeared to be going further;
042	LUK	024	029	but they pressed him not to do so. ‘Stay with us,’ they said, ‘for it is getting towards evening, and the sun is already low.’ So Jesus went in to stay with them.
042	LUK	024	030	After he had taken his place at the table with them, he took the bread and said the blessing, and broke it, and gave it to them.
042	LUK	024	031	Then their eyes were opened and they recognised him; but he disappeared from their sight.
042	LUK	024	032	‘How our hearts glowed,’ the disciples said to each other, ‘while he was talking to us on the road, and when he explained the scriptures to us!’
042	LUK	024	033	Then they immediately got up and returned to Jerusalem, where they found the Eleven and their companions all together,
042	LUK	024	034	who told them that the Master had really risen, and had appeared to Simon.
042	LUK	024	035	So they also related what had happened during their walk, and how they had recognised Jesus at the breaking of the bread.
042	LUK	024	036	While they were still talking about these things, Jesus himself stood among them.
042	LUK	024	037	In their terror and alarm they thought they saw a ghost,
042	LUK	024	038	but Jesus said to them, ‘Why are you so startled? And why do doubts arise in your minds?
042	LUK	024	039	Look at my hands and my feet, and you will know that it is I. Feel me, and look at me, for a ghost has not flesh and bones, as you see that I have.’
042	LUK	024	041	While they were still unable to believe it all, overcome with joy, and were wondering if it were true, Jesus said to them, ‘Have you anything here to eat?’
042	LUK	024	042	They handed him a piece of broiled fish,
042	LUK	024	043	and he took it and ate it before their eyes.
042	LUK	024	044	‘This is what I told you,’ he said, ‘when I was still with you – that everything that had been written about me in the Law of Moses, the prophets, and the Psalms, must be fulfilled.’
042	LUK	024	045	Then he enabled them to understand the meaning of the scriptures, saying to them,
042	LUK	024	046	‘Scripture says that the Christ will suffer, and that he will rise again from the dead on the third day,
042	LUK	024	047	and that repentance for forgiveness of sins will be proclaimed on his authority to all the nations – beginning at Jerusalem.
042	LUK	024	048	You yourselves are to be witnesses to all this.
042	LUK	024	049	And now I am myself about to send you that which my Father has promised. But you must remain in the city until you have been invested with power from above.’
042	LUK	024	050	After this, Jesus led them out as far as Bethany, and there raised his hands and blessed them.
042	LUK	024	051	As he was in the act of blessing them, he left them.
042	LUK	024	052	They returned to Jerusalem full of joy;
042	LUK	024	053	and they were constantly in the Temple Courts, blessing God.

# BOOK	043	JOH	John	John
043	JOH	001	001	In the beginning the Word was; and the Word was with God; and the Word was God.
043	JOH	001	002	He was in the beginning with God;
043	JOH	001	003	through him all things came into being, and nothing came into being apart from him.
043	JOH	001	004	That which came into being in him was life; and the life was the light of humanity;
043	JOH	001	005	and the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness never overpowered it.
043	JOH	001	006	There appeared a man sent from God, whose name was John;
043	JOH	001	007	he came as a witness – to bear witness to the light so that through him everyone might believe.
043	JOH	001	008	He was not the light, but he came to bear witness to the light.
043	JOH	001	009	That was the true light which enlightens everyone coming into the world.
043	JOH	001	010	He was in the world; and through him the world came into being – yet the world did not know him.
043	JOH	001	011	He came to his own – yet his own did not receive him.
043	JOH	001	012	But to all who did receive him he gave power to become children of God – to those who believe in his name.
043	JOH	001	013	For not to natural conception, nor to human instincts, nor to human will did they owe the new life, but to God.
043	JOH	001	014	And the Word became human, and lived among us, (We saw his glory – the glory of the Only Son sent from the Father), full of love and truth.
043	JOH	001	015	(John bears witness to him; he cried aloud – for it was he who spoke – ‘He who is coming after me is now before me, for he was ever first’);
043	JOH	001	016	out of his fullness we have all received gift after gift of love;
043	JOH	001	017	for the Law was given through Moses, love and truth came through Jesus Christ.
043	JOH	001	018	No one has ever yet seen God; God the only Son, who is ever with the Father – he has revealed him.
043	JOH	001	019	When the religious authorities in Jerusalem sent some Priests and Levites to ask John – ‘Who are you?’,
043	JOH	001	020	he told them clearly and simply, ‘I am not the Christ.’
043	JOH	001	021	‘What then?’ they asked. ‘Are you Elijah?’ ‘No,’ he said, ‘I am not.’ ‘Are you “the prophet”?’ He answered, ‘No.’
043	JOH	001	022	‘Who then are you?’ they continued. ‘Tell us so that we have an answer to give to those who have sent us. What do you say about yourself?’
043	JOH	001	023	‘I,’ he answered, ‘am – “The voice of one crying aloud in the wilderness: make a straight road for the Lord”, as the prophet Isaiah said.’
043	JOH	001	024	These men had been sent from the Pharisees;
043	JOH	001	025	and their next question was, ‘Why then do you baptise, if you are not the Christ or Elijah or “the prophet”?’
043	JOH	001	026	John’s answer was – ‘I baptise with water, but among you stands one whom you do not know;
043	JOH	001	027	he is coming after me, yet I am not worthy even to unfasten his sandal.’
043	JOH	001	028	This happened at Bethany, across the Jordan, where John was baptising.
043	JOH	001	029	The next day John saw Jesus coming towards him, and exclaimed, ‘Here is the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!
043	JOH	001	030	I was talking about him when I said “After me there is coming a man who ranks ahead of me, because before I was born he already was.”
043	JOH	001	031	I did not know who he was, but I have come baptising with water to make him known to Israel.’
043	JOH	001	032	John also said: ‘I saw the Spirit come down from heaven like a dove and rest on him.
043	JOH	001	033	I myself did not know him, but he who sent me to baptise with water, he said to me “He on whom you see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him – he it is who baptises with the Holy Spirit.”
043	JOH	001	034	This I have seen myself, and I have declared my belief that he is the Son of God.’
043	JOH	001	035	The next day, when John was standing with two of his disciples,
043	JOH	001	036	he looked at Jesus as he passed and exclaimed, ‘There is the Lamb of God!’
043	JOH	001	037	The two disciples heard him say this, and followed Jesus.
043	JOH	001	038	But Jesus turned round, and saw them following. ‘What are you looking for?’ he asked. ‘Rabbi,’ they answered (or, as we should say, “Teacher”), ‘where are you staying?’
043	JOH	001	039	‘Come, and you will see,’ he replied. So they went, and saw where he was staying, and spent that day with him. It was then about four in the afternoon.
043	JOH	001	040	One of the two, who heard what John said and followed Jesus, was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother.
043	JOH	001	041	He first found his own brother Simon, and said to him, ‘We have found the Messiah!’ (a word which means “Christ,” or “Consecrated”.)
043	JOH	001	042	Then he brought him to Jesus. Looking straight at him, Jesus said, ‘You are Simon, the son of John; you will be called Cephas’ (which means “Peter,” or “Rock”).
043	JOH	001	043	The following day Jesus decided to leave for Galilee. He found Philip, and said to him, ‘Follow me.’
043	JOH	001	044	Philip was from Bethsaida, the same town as Andrew and Peter.
043	JOH	001	045	He found Nathanael and said to him, ‘We have found him of whom Moses wrote in the Law, and of whom the prophets also wrote – Jesus of Nazareth, Joseph’s son!’
043	JOH	001	046	‘Can anything good come out of Nazareth?’ asked Nathanael. ‘Come and see,’ replied Philip.
043	JOH	001	047	When Jesus saw Nathanael coming towards him, he said, ‘Here is a true Israelite, in whom there is no deceit!’
043	JOH	001	048	‘How do you know me?’ asked Nathanael. ‘Even before Philip called you,’ replied Jesus, ‘when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.’
043	JOH	001	049	‘Rabbi,’ Nathanael exclaimed, ‘you are the Son of God, you are king of Israel!’
043	JOH	001	050	‘Do you believe in me,’ asked Jesus, ‘because I told you that I saw you under the fig tree? You will see greater things than those!
043	JOH	001	051	In truth I tell you,’ he added, ‘you will all see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.’
043	JOH	002	001	Two days after this there was a wedding at Cana in Galilee, and Jesus’ mother was there.
043	JOH	002	002	Jesus himself, too, with his disciples, was invited to the wedding.
043	JOH	002	003	And, when the wine ran short, his mother said to him, ‘They have no wine left.’
043	JOH	002	004	‘What do you want with me?’ answered Jesus. ‘My time has not come yet.’
043	JOH	002	005	His mother said to the servants, ‘Do whatever he tells you.’
043	JOH	002	006	There were standing there six stone water-jars, in accordance with the Jewish rule of purification, each holding twenty or thirty gallons.
043	JOH	002	007	Jesus said to the servants, ‘Fill the water-jars with water.’
043	JOH	002	008	And, when they had filled them to the brim, he added, ‘Now take some out, and carry it to the Master of the feast.’ The servants did so.
043	JOH	002	009	And, when the Master of the feast had tasted the water which had now become wine, not knowing where it had come from – although the servants who had taken out the water knew –
043	JOH	002	010	He called the groom and said to him, ‘Everyone puts good wine on the table first, and inferior wine afterwards, when his guests have drunk freely; but you have kept back the good wine until now!’
043	JOH	002	011	This, the first sign of his mission, Jesus gave at Cana in Galilee, and by it revealed his glory; and his disciples believed in him.
043	JOH	002	012	After this, Jesus went down to Capernaum – he, his mother, his brothers, and his disciples; but they stayed there only a few days.
043	JOH	002	013	Then, as the Jewish Passover was near, Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
043	JOH	002	014	In the Temple Courts he found people who were selling bullocks, sheep, and pigeons, and the money changers at their counters.
043	JOH	002	015	So he made a whip of cords, and drove them all out of the Temple Courts, and the sheep and bullocks as well; he scattered the money of the money changers, and overturned their tables,
043	JOH	002	016	and said to the pigeon-dealers, ‘Take these things away. Do not turn my Father’s house into a market house.’
043	JOH	002	017	His disciples remembered that scripture said – “Passion for your house will consume me.”
043	JOH	002	018	Then some of the religious authorities asked Jesus, ‘What sign are you going to show us, since you act in this way?’
043	JOH	002	019	‘Destroy this temple,’ was his answer, ‘and I will raise it in three days.’
043	JOH	002	020	‘This Temple,’ the authorities replied, ‘has been forty-six years in building, and are you going to “raise it in three days”?’
043	JOH	002	021	But Jesus was speaking of his body as a temple.
043	JOH	002	022	Afterwards, when he had risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this; and they believed the passage of scripture, and the words which Jesus had spoken.
043	JOH	002	023	While Jesus was in Jerusalem, during the Passover Festival, many came to trust in him, when they saw the signs of his mission that he was giving.
043	JOH	002	024	But Jesus did not put himself in their power because he knew what was in their hearts.
043	JOH	002	025	He did not need anyone to tell him about people because he could read what was in them.
043	JOH	003	001	Now there was a Pharisee named Nicodemus, who was a leading man among his people.
043	JOH	003	002	This man came to Jesus by night, and said to him, ‘Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God; for no one could give such signs as you are giving, unless God were with him.’
043	JOH	003	003	‘In truth I tell you,’ exclaimed Jesus, ‘unless a person is reborn, they cannot see the kingdom of God.’
043	JOH	003	004	‘How can a person,’ asked Nicodemus, ‘be born when they are old? Can they be born a second time?’
043	JOH	003	005	‘In truth I tell you,’ answered Jesus, ‘unless a person owes their birth to water and Spirit, they cannot enter the kingdom of God.
043	JOH	003	006	All that owes its birth to human nature is human, and all that owes its birth to the Spirit is spiritual.
043	JOH	003	007	Do not wonder at my telling you that you all need to be reborn.
043	JOH	003	008	The wind blows wherever it wants, and you can hear the sound it makes, but you do not know where it comes from, or where it goes; it is the same with everyone who owes his birth to the Spirit.’
043	JOH	003	009	‘How can that be?’ asked Nicodemus.
043	JOH	003	010	‘What! You a teacher of Israel,’ exclaimed Jesus, ‘and yet do not understand this!
043	JOH	003	011	In truth I tell you that we speak of what we know, and state what we have seen; and yet you do not accept our statements.
043	JOH	003	012	If, when I tell you earthly things, you do not believe me, how will you believe me when I tell you of heavenly things?
043	JOH	003	013	No one has ascended to heaven, except him who descended from heaven – the Son of Man himself.
043	JOH	003	014	And, as Moses lifted up the snake in the desert, so must the Son of Man be lifted up;
043	JOH	003	015	so that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life.’
043	JOH	003	016	For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him may not be lost, but have eternal life.
043	JOH	003	017	For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but so that the world might be saved through him.
043	JOH	003	018	The person who believes in him escapes condemnation, while the person who does not believe in him is already condemned, because they have not believed in the only Son of God.
043	JOH	003	019	The ground of their condemnation is this, that though the light has come into the world, people preferred the darkness to the light, because their actions were wicked.
043	JOH	003	020	For the person who lives an evil life hates the light, and will not come to it, fearing that their actions will be exposed;
043	JOH	003	021	but the person who lives by the truth comes into the light, so it can be clearly seen that God is in all they do.
043	JOH	003	022	After this, Jesus went with his disciples into the country parts of Judea; and there he stayed with them, and baptised.
043	JOH	003	023	John, also, was baptising at Aenon near Salim, because there were many streams there; and people were constantly coming and being baptised.
043	JOH	003	024	(For John had not yet been imprisoned).
043	JOH	003	025	Now a discussion arose between some of John’s disciples and a fellow Jew on the subject of purification;
043	JOH	003	026	and the disciples came to John and said, ‘Rabbi, the man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan, and to whom you have yourself borne testimony – he, also, is baptising, and everybody is going to him.’
043	JOH	003	027	John’s answer was – ‘A person can gain nothing but what is given them from heaven.
043	JOH	003	028	You are yourselves witnesses that I said “I am not the Christ,” but “I have been sent before him as a messenger.”
043	JOH	003	029	It is the groom who has the bride; but the groom’s friend, who stands by and listens to him, is filled with joy when he hears the groom’s voice. This joy I have felt to the full.
043	JOH	003	030	He must become greater, and I less.’
043	JOH	003	031	He who comes from above is above all others; but a child of earth is earthly, and his teaching is earthly, too. He who comes from heaven is above all others.
043	JOH	003	032	He states what he has seen and what he heard, and yet no one accepts his statement.
043	JOH	003	033	They who did accept his statement confirm the fact that God is true.
043	JOH	003	034	For he whom God sent as his messenger gives us God’s own teaching, for God does not limit the gift of the Spirit.
043	JOH	003	035	The Father loves his Son, and has put everything in his hands.
043	JOH	003	036	The person who believes in the Son has eternal life, while a person who rejects the Son will not even see that life, but remains under God’s displeasure.
043	JOH	004	001	Now, when the Master heard that the Pharisees had been told that he was making and baptising more disciples than John
043	JOH	004	002	(Though it was not Jesus himself, but his disciples, who baptised),
043	JOH	004	003	he left Judea, and set out again for Galilee.
043	JOH	004	004	He had to pass through Samaria,
043	JOH	004	005	and, on his way, he came to a Samaritan town called Shechem, near the plot of land that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.
043	JOH	004	006	Jacob’s Spring was there, and Jesus, being tired after his journey, sat down beside the spring, just as he was. It was then about midday.
043	JOH	004	007	A woman of Samaria came to draw water; and Jesus said to her – ‘Give me some to drink,’
043	JOH	004	008	For his disciples had gone into the town to buy food.
043	JOH	004	009	‘How is it,’ replied the Samaritan woman, ‘that you who are a Jew ask for water from a Samaritan woman like me?’ (For Jews do not associate with Samaritans).
043	JOH	004	010	‘If you knew of the gift of God,’ replied Jesus, ‘and who it is that is saying to you “Give me some water,” you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.’
043	JOH	004	011	‘You have no bucket, Sir, and the well is deep,’ she said. ‘Where did you get that “living water?”
043	JOH	004	012	Surely you are not greater than our ancestor Jacob who gave us the well, and used to drink from it himself, and his sons, and his cattle!’
043	JOH	004	013	‘All who drink of this water,’ replied Jesus, ‘will be thirsty again;
043	JOH	004	014	but whoever once drinks of the water that I will give him will never thirst any more; but the water that I will give him will become a spring welling up within him – a source of eternal life.’
043	JOH	004	015	‘Give me this water, Sir,’ said the woman, ‘so that I may not be thirsty, nor have to come all the way here to draw water.’
043	JOH	004	016	‘Go and call your husband,’ said Jesus, ‘and then come back.’
043	JOH	004	017	‘I have no husband,’ answered the woman. ‘You are right in saying “I have no husband,”’ replied Jesus,
043	JOH	004	018	‘For you have had five husbands, and the man with whom you are now living is not your husband; in saying that, you have spoken the truth.’
043	JOH	004	019	‘I see, Sir, that you are a prophet!’ exclaimed the woman.
043	JOH	004	020	‘It was on this mountain that our ancestors worshiped; and yet you Jews say that the proper place for worship is in Jerusalem.’
043	JOH	004	021	‘Believe me,’ replied Jesus, ‘a time is coming when it will be neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem that you will worship the Father.
043	JOH	004	022	You Samaritans do not know what you worship; we know what we worship, for salvation comes from the Jews.
043	JOH	004	023	But a time is coming, indeed it is already here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father spiritually and truly; for such are the worshipers that the Father desires.
043	JOH	004	024	God is Spirit; and those who worship him must worship spiritually and truly.’
043	JOH	004	025	‘I know,’ answered the woman, ‘that the Messiah, who is called the Christ, is coming; when once he has come, he will tell us everything.’
043	JOH	004	026	‘I am he,’ Jesus said to her, ‘I who am speaking to you.’
043	JOH	004	027	At this moment his disciples came up, and were surprised to find him talking with a woman; but none of them asked “What do you want?” or “Why are you talking with her?”
043	JOH	004	028	So the woman, leaving her pitcher, went back to the town, and said to the people,
043	JOH	004	029	‘Come and see someone who has told me everything that I have done. Can he be the Christ?’
043	JOH	004	030	And the people left the town and went to see Jesus.
043	JOH	004	031	Meanwhile the disciples kept saying to him, ‘Take something to eat, Rabbi.’
043	JOH	004	032	‘I have food to eat,’ he answered, ‘of which you know nothing.’
043	JOH	004	033	‘Can anyone have brought him anything to eat?’ the disciples said to one another.
043	JOH	004	034	‘My food,’ replied Jesus, ‘is to do the will of him who sent me, and to complete his work.
043	JOH	004	035	Don’t you say that it still wants four months to harvest? Why, look up, and see how white the fields are for harvest!
043	JOH	004	036	Already the reaper is receiving wages and gathering in sheaves for eternal life, so that sower and reaper rejoice together.
043	JOH	004	037	For here the proverb holds good – “One sows, another reaps.”
043	JOH	004	038	I have sent you to reap that on which you have spent no labour; others have laboured, and you have reaped the results of their labour.’
043	JOH	004	039	Many from that town came to believe in Jesus – Samaritans though they were – because the woman had said, “He has told me everything that I have done.”
043	JOH	004	040	And, when these Samaritans had come to Jesus, they begged him to stay with them, and he stayed there two days.
043	JOH	004	041	But far more came to believe in him because of what he said himself,
043	JOH	004	042	and they said to the woman, ‘It is no longer because of what you say that we believe in him, for we have heard him ourselves and know that he really is the Saviour of the world.’
043	JOH	004	043	After these two days Jesus went on to Galilee;
043	JOH	004	044	for he himself declared that “a prophet is not honoured in his own country.”
043	JOH	004	045	When he entered Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him, for they had seen all that he did at Jerusalem during the Festival, at which they also had been present.
043	JOH	004	046	So Jesus came again to Cana in Galilee, where he had turned the water into wine. Now there was one of the king’s officers whose son was lying ill at Capernaum.
043	JOH	004	047	When this man heard that Jesus had returned from Judea to Galilee, he went to him, and begged him to come down and cure his son; for he was at the point of death.
043	JOH	004	048	Jesus answered, ‘Unless you all see signs and wonders, you will not believe.’
043	JOH	004	049	‘Sir,’ said the officer, ‘come down before my child dies.’ And Jesus answered, ‘Go, your son is living.’
043	JOH	004	050	The man believed what Jesus said to him, and went;
043	JOH	004	051	and, while he was on his way down, his servants met him, and told him that his child was living.
043	JOH	004	052	So he asked them at what time the boy began to get better. ‘It was yesterday, about one o’clock,’ they said, ‘that the fever left him.’
043	JOH	004	053	By this the father knew that it was at the very time when Jesus had said to him “Your son is living”; and he himself, with all his household, believed in Jesus.
043	JOH	004	054	This was the second occasion on which Jesus gave a sign of his mission on coming from Judea to Galilee.
043	JOH	005	001	Sometime after this there was a Jewish Festival; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
043	JOH	005	002	There is in Jerusalem, near the sheep-gate, a bath with five colonnades round it. It is called in Hebrew “Bethesda.”
043	JOH	005	003	In these colonnades a large number of sick people were lying – blind, lame, and crippled.
043	JOH	005	005	One man who was there had been crippled for thirty-eight years.
043	JOH	005	006	Jesus saw the man lying there, and, finding that he had been in this state a long time, said to him, ‘Do you wish to be cured?’
043	JOH	005	007	‘I have no one, Sir,’ the sick man answered, ‘to put me into the bath when there is a troubling of the water, and, while I am getting to it, someone else steps down before me.’
043	JOH	005	008	‘Stand up,’ said Jesus, ‘take up your mat, and walk.’
043	JOH	005	009	The man was cured immediately, and took up his mat and began walking.
043	JOH	005	010	Now it was the Sabbath. So the religious authorities said to the man who had been cured, ‘This is the Sabbath; you must not carry your mat.’
043	JOH	005	011	‘The man who cured me,’ he answered, ‘said to me “Take up your mat and walk.”’
043	JOH	005	012	‘Who was it,’ they asked, ‘that said to you “Take up your mat and walk”?’
043	JOH	005	013	But the man who had been restored did not know who it was; for Jesus had moved away, because there was a crowd there.
043	JOH	005	014	Afterwards Jesus found the man in the Temple Courts, and said to him, ‘You are cured now; do not sin again, or something worse may happen to you.’
043	JOH	005	015	The man went away, and told the authorities that it was Jesus who had cured him.
043	JOH	005	016	And that was why they began to persecute Jesus – because he did things of this kind on the Sabbath.
043	JOH	005	017	But Jesus replied, ‘My Father works to this very hour, and I work also.’
043	JOH	005	018	This made the authorities all the more eager to kill him, because not only was he doing away with the Sabbath, but he actually called God his own Father – putting himself on an equality with God.
043	JOH	005	019	So Jesus made this further reply, ‘In truth I tell you, the Son can do nothing of himself; he does only what he sees the Father doing; whatever the Father does, the Son does also.
043	JOH	005	020	For the Father loves his Son, and shows him everything that he is doing; and he will show him still greater things – so that you will be filled with wonder.
043	JOH	005	021	For, just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whom he pleases.
043	JOH	005	022	The Father himself does not judge any one, but has entrusted the work of judging entirely to his Son,
043	JOH	005	023	so that everyone may honour the Son, just as they honour the Father. The person who does not honour the Son fails to honour the Father who sent him.
043	JOH	005	024	In truth I tell you that the person who listens to my message and believes him who sent me, has eternal life, and does not come under condemnation, but has already passed out of death into life.
043	JOH	005	025	In truth I tell you that a time is coming, indeed it is already here, when the dead will listen to the voice of the Son of God, and when those who listen will live.
043	JOH	005	026	For, just as the Father has inherent life within him, so also he has granted to the Son to have inherent life within him;
043	JOH	005	027	and, because he is Son of Man, he has also given him authority to act as judge.
043	JOH	005	028	Do not wonder at this; for the time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice,
043	JOH	005	029	and will come out – those who have done good rising to life, and those who have lived evil lives rising for condemnation.
043	JOH	005	030	I can do nothing of myself; I judge as I am taught; and the judgment that I give is just, because my aim is not to do my own will, but the will of him who sent me.
043	JOH	005	031	‘If I bear testimony to myself, my testimony is not trustworthy;
043	JOH	005	032	it is another who bears testimony to me, and I know that the testimony which he bears to me is trustworthy.
043	JOH	005	033	You have yourselves sent to John, and he has testified to the truth.
043	JOH	005	034	But the testimony which I receive is not from people; I am saying this for your salvation.
043	JOH	005	035	He was the Lamp that was burning and shining, and you were ready to rejoice, for a time, in his light.
043	JOH	005	036	But the testimony which I have is of greater weight than John’s; for the work that the Father has given me to carry out – the work that I am doing – is in itself proof that the Father has sent me as his messenger.
043	JOH	005	037	The Father who has sent me has himself borne testimony to me. You have neither listened to his voice nor seen his form,
043	JOH	005	038	and you have not taken his message home to your hearts, because you do not believe him whom he sent as his messenger.
043	JOH	005	039	You search the scriptures, because you think that you find in them immortal life; and, though it is those scriptures that bear testimony to me,
043	JOH	005	040	you refuse to come to me to have life.
043	JOH	005	041	‘I do not receive honour from people,
043	JOH	005	042	but I know this of you, that you have not the love of God in your hearts.
043	JOH	005	043	I have come in my Father’s name, and you do not receive me; if another comes in his own name, you will receive him.
043	JOH	005	044	How can you believe in me, when you receive honour from one another and do not desire the honour which comes from the only God?
043	JOH	005	045	Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father; your accuser is Moses, on whom you have been resting your hopes.
043	JOH	005	046	For, had you believed Moses, you would have believed me, for it was of me that Moses wrote;
043	JOH	005	047	but, if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe my teaching?’
043	JOH	006	001	After this, Jesus crossed the Sea of Galilee – otherwise called the Lake of Tiberias.
043	JOH	006	002	A great crowd of people, however, followed him, because they saw the signs of his mission in his work among those who were sick.
043	JOH	006	003	Jesus went up the hill, and sat down there with his disciples.
043	JOH	006	004	It was near the time of the Jewish Festival of the Passover.
043	JOH	006	005	Looking up, and noticing that a great crowd was coming towards him, Jesus said to Philip, ‘Where are we to buy bread for these people to eat?’
043	JOH	006	006	He said this to test him, for he himself knew what he meant to do.
043	JOH	006	007	‘Even if we spent a years’ wages on bread,’ answered Philip, ‘it would not be enough for each of them to have a little.’
043	JOH	006	008	‘There is a boy here,’ said Andrew, another of his disciples, Simon Peter’s brother,
043	JOH	006	009	‘Who has five barley loaves and two fish; but what is that for so many?’
043	JOH	006	010	‘Make the people sit down,’ said Jesus. It was a grassy spot; so the people, who numbered about five thousand, sat down,
043	JOH	006	011	and then Jesus took the loaves, and, after saying the thanksgiving, distributed them to those who were sitting down; and the same with the fish, giving the people as much as they wanted.
043	JOH	006	012	When they were satisfied, Jesus said to his disciples, ‘Collect the broken pieces that are left, so that nothing may be wasted.’
043	JOH	006	013	The disciples did so, and filled twelve baskets with the pieces of the five barley loaves, which were left after all had eaten.
043	JOH	006	014	When the people saw the signs which Jesus gave, they said, ‘This is certainly the prophet who was to come into the world.’
043	JOH	006	015	But Jesus, having discovered that they were intending to come and carry him off to make him king, went again up the hill, quite alone.
043	JOH	006	016	When evening fell, his disciples went down to the sea,
043	JOH	006	017	and, getting into a boat, began to cross to Capernaum. By this time darkness had set in, and Jesus had not yet come back to them;
043	JOH	006	018	the sea, too, was getting rough, for a strong wind was blowing.
043	JOH	006	019	When they had rowed three or four miles, they caught sight of him walking on the water and approaching the boat, and they were frightened.
043	JOH	006	020	But Jesus said to them, ‘It is I; do not be afraid!’
043	JOH	006	021	And after this they were glad to take him into the boat; and the boat at once arrived off the shore, for which they had been making.
043	JOH	006	022	The people who remained on the other side of the sea had seen that only one boat had been there, and that Jesus had not gone into it with his disciples, but that they had left without him.
043	JOH	006	023	Some boats, however, had come from Tiberias, from near the spot where they had eaten the bread after the Master had said the thanksgiving.
043	JOH	006	024	So, on the next day, when the people saw that Jesus was not there, or his disciples either, they themselves got into the boats, and went to Capernaum to look for him.
043	JOH	006	025	And, when they found him on the other side of the sea, they said, ‘When did you get here, Rabbi?’
043	JOH	006	026	‘In truth I tell you,’ answered Jesus, ‘it is not because of the signs which you saw that you are looking for me, but because you had the bread to eat and were satisfied.
043	JOH	006	027	Work, not for the food that perishes, but for the food that lasts for eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you; for on him the Father – God himself – has set the seal of his approval.’
043	JOH	006	028	‘How,’ they asked, ‘are we to do the work that God wants us to do?’
043	JOH	006	029	‘The work that God wants you to do,’ answered Jesus, ‘is to believe in him whom God sent as his messenger.’
043	JOH	006	030	‘What sign, then,’ they asked, ‘are you giving, which we may see, and so believe you? What is the work that you are doing?
043	JOH	006	031	Our ancestors had the manna to eat in the desert; as scripture says – “He gave them bread from heaven to eat.”’
043	JOH	006	032	‘In truth I tell you,’ replied Jesus, ‘Moses did not give you the bread from heaven, but my Father does give you the true bread from heaven;
043	JOH	006	033	for the bread that God gives is that which comes down from heaven, and gives life to the world.’
043	JOH	006	034	‘Master,’ they exclaimed, ‘give us that bread always!’
043	JOH	006	035	‘I am the life-giving bread,’ Jesus said to them, ‘whoever comes to me will never be hungry, and whoever believes in me will never thirst again.
043	JOH	006	036	But, as I have said already, you have seen me, and yet you do not believe in me.
043	JOH	006	037	All those whom the Father gives me will come to me; and no one who comes to me will I ever turn away.
043	JOH	006	038	For I have come down from heaven, to do, not my own will, but the will of him who sent me;
043	JOH	006	039	and his will is this – that I should not lose one of all those whom he has given me, but should raise them up at the Last day.
043	JOH	006	040	For it is the will of my Father that everyone who sees the Son, and believes in him, should have immortal life; and I myself will raise him up at the Last day.’
043	JOH	006	041	The people began murmuring against Jesus for saying – “I am the bread which came down from heaven.”
043	JOH	006	042	‘Is not this Jesus, Joseph’s son,’ they asked, ‘whose father and mother we know? How is it that he now says that he has come down from heaven?’
043	JOH	006	043	‘Do not murmur among yourselves,’ said Jesus in reply.
043	JOH	006	044	‘No one can come to me, unless the Father who sent me draws him to me; and I will raise him up at the Last day.
043	JOH	006	045	It is said in the prophets – “And they will all be taught by God.” Everyone who is taught by the Father and learns from him comes to me.
043	JOH	006	046	Not that anyone has seen the Father, except him who is from God – he has seen the Father.
043	JOH	006	047	In truth I tell you, the person who believes in me has eternal life.
043	JOH	006	048	I am the life-giving bread.
043	JOH	006	049	Your ancestors ate the manna in the desert, and yet died.
043	JOH	006	050	The bread that comes down from heaven is such that whoever eats of it will never die.
043	JOH	006	051	I am the living bread that has come down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, they will live for ever; and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.’
043	JOH	006	052	They began disputing with one another, ‘How is it possible for this man to give us his flesh to eat?’
043	JOH	006	053	‘In truth I tell you,’ answered Jesus, ‘unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man, and drink his blood, you have not life within you.
043	JOH	006	054	Everyone who takes my flesh for their food, and drinks my blood, has eternal life; and I will raise them up at the Last day.
043	JOH	006	055	For my flesh is true food, and my blood true drink.
043	JOH	006	056	Everyone who takes my flesh for their food, and drinks my blood, remains united to me, and I to them.
043	JOH	006	057	As the living Father sent me as his messenger, and as I live because the Father lives, so the person who takes me for their food will live because I live.
043	JOH	006	058	That is the bread which has come down from heaven – not such as your ancestors ate, and yet died; the person who takes this bread for their food will live for ever.’
043	JOH	006	059	All this Jesus said in a synagogue, when he was teaching in Capernaum.
043	JOH	006	060	On hearing it, many of his disciples said, ‘This is harsh doctrine! Who can bear to listen to it?’
043	JOH	006	061	But Jesus, aware that his disciples were murmuring about it, said to them,
043	JOH	006	062	‘Is this a hindrance to you? What, then, if you should see the Son of Man ascending where he was before?
043	JOH	006	063	It is the Spirit that gives life; human strength achieves nothing. In the teaching that I have been giving you there is Spirit and there is life.
043	JOH	006	064	Yet there are some of you who do not believe in me.’ For Jesus knew from the first who they were that did not believe in him, and who it was that would betray him;
043	JOH	006	065	and he added, ‘This is why I told you that no one can come to me, unless enabled by the Father.’
043	JOH	006	066	After this many of his disciples drew back, and did not go about with him any longer.
043	JOH	006	067	So Jesus said to the Twelve, ‘Do you also wish to leave me?’
043	JOH	006	068	But Simon Peter answered, ‘Master, to whom would we go? Eternal life is in your teaching;
043	JOH	006	069	and we have learned to believe and to know that you are the Holy One of God.’
043	JOH	006	070	‘Didn’t I myself choose you to be the Twelve?’ replied Jesus, ‘and yet, even of you, one is playing the devil’s part.’
043	JOH	006	071	He meant Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, who was about to betray him, though he was one of the Twelve.
043	JOH	007	001	After this, Jesus went about in Galilee, for he would not do so in Judea, because the religious authorities (in Jerusalem) were eager to put him to death.
043	JOH	007	002	When the Jewish Festival of Tabernacles was near,
043	JOH	007	003	his brothers said to him, ‘Leave this part of the country, and go into Judea, so that your disciples, as well as we, may see the work that you are doing.
043	JOH	007	004	For no one does a thing privately, if they are seeking to be widely known. Since you do these things, you should show yourself publicly to the world.’
043	JOH	007	005	For even his brothers did not believe in him.
043	JOH	007	006	‘My time,’ answered Jesus, ‘is not come yet, but your time is always here.
043	JOH	007	007	The world cannot hate you, but it does hate me, because I testify that its ways are evil.
043	JOH	007	008	Go yourselves up to the Festival; I am not going to this Festival yet, because my time has not yet come.’
043	JOH	007	009	After telling them this, he stayed on in Galilee.
043	JOH	007	010	But, when his brothers had gone up to the Festival, Jesus also went up – not publicly, but privately.
043	JOH	007	011	The authorities were looking for him at the Festival and asking “Where is he?”;
043	JOH	007	012	and there were many whispers about him among the people, some saying “He is a good man;” others, “No! He is leading the people astray.”
043	JOH	007	013	No one, however, spoke freely about him, because they were afraid of the authorities.
043	JOH	007	014	About the middle of the Festival week, Jesus went up into the Temple Courts, and began teaching.
043	JOH	007	015	The authorities were astonished. ‘How has this man got his learning,’ they asked, ‘when he has never studied?’
043	JOH	007	016	So, in reply, Jesus said, ‘My teaching is not my own; it is his who sent me.
043	JOH	007	017	If anyone has the will to do God’s will, they will find out whether my teaching is from God, or whether I speak on my own authority.
043	JOH	007	018	The person who speaks on their own authority seeks honour for themselves; but the one who seeks the honour of him who sent him is sincere, and there is nothing false in him.
043	JOH	007	019	Was not it Moses who gave you the Law? Yet not one of you obeys it! Why are you seeking to put me to death?’
043	JOH	007	020	‘You must be possessed by a demon!’ the people exclaimed. ‘Who is seeking to put you to death?’
043	JOH	007	021	‘There was one thing I did,’ replied Jesus, ‘at which you are all still wondering.
043	JOH	007	022	But that is why Moses has instituted circumcision among you – not, indeed, that it began with him, but with our ancestors – and that is why you circumcise even on a Sabbath.
043	JOH	007	023	When a man receives circumcision on a Sabbath to prevent the Law of Moses from being broken, how can you be angry with me for making a man sound and well on a Sabbath?
043	JOH	007	024	Do not judge by appearances; judge justly.’
043	JOH	007	025	At this some of the people of Jerusalem exclaimed, ‘Is not this the man who they are seeking to put to death?
043	JOH	007	026	Yet here he is, speaking out boldly, and they say nothing to him! Is it possible that our leading men have really discovered that he is the Christ?
043	JOH	007	027	Yet we know where this man is from; but, when the Christ comes, no one will be able to tell where he is from.’
043	JOH	007	028	Therefore, Jesus, as he was teaching in the Temple Courts, raised his voice and said, ‘Yes; you know me and you know where I am from. Yet I have not come on my own authority, but he who sent me may be trusted; and him you do not know.
043	JOH	007	029	I do know him, for it is from him that I have come, and he sent me as his messenger.’
043	JOH	007	030	So they sought to arrest him; but no one touched him, for his time was not come yet.
043	JOH	007	031	Many of the people, however, believed in him. ‘When the Christ comes,’ they said, ‘will he give more signs of his mission than this man has given?’
043	JOH	007	032	The Pharisees heard the people whispering about him in this way, and so the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to arrest him;
043	JOH	007	033	at which Jesus said, ‘I will be with you but a little longer, and then I am going to him who sent me.
043	JOH	007	034	You will look for me, and you will not find me; and you will not be able to come where I will be.’
043	JOH	007	035	‘Where is this man going,’ the people asked one another, ‘that we would not find him? Will he go to our countrymen abroad, and teach foreigners?
043	JOH	007	036	What does he mean by saying “You will look for me, and you will not find me; and you will not be able to come where I will be”?’
043	JOH	007	037	On the last and greatest day of the Festival, Jesus, who was standing by, exclaimed, ‘If anyone is thirsty, they should come to me and drink.
043	JOH	007	038	From the heart of those who believe in me will flow, as is said in scripture, rivers of living water.’
043	JOH	007	039	(By this he meant the Spirit, which those who had believed in him were to receive; for the Spirit had not yet come, because Jesus had not yet been exalted.)
043	JOH	007	040	Some of the people, when they heard these words, said, ‘This is certainly the Prophet!’;
043	JOH	007	041	others said, ‘the Christ!’; but some asked, ‘What! Does the Christ come from Galilee?
043	JOH	007	042	Is not it said in scripture that it is of the descendants of David, and from Bethlehem, the village to which David belonged, that the Christ is to come?’
043	JOH	007	043	So there was a sharp division among the people because of Jesus.
043	JOH	007	044	Some of them wanted to arrest him, and yet no one touched him.
043	JOH	007	045	When the officers returned to the chief priests and Pharisees, they were asked, ‘Why have you not brought him?’
043	JOH	007	046	‘No one ever spoke as he speaks!’ they answered.
043	JOH	007	047	‘What! Have you been led astray too?’ the Pharisees replied.
043	JOH	007	048	‘Have any of our leading men believed in him, or any of the Pharisees?
043	JOH	007	049	As for these people who do not know the Law – they are cursed!’
043	JOH	007	050	But one of their number, Nicodemus, who before this had been to see Jesus, said to them,
043	JOH	007	051	‘Does our Law pass judgment on a person without first giving them a hearing, and finding out what they have been doing?’
043	JOH	007	052	‘Are you also from Galilee?’ they retorted. ‘Search, and you will find that no prophet is to arise in Galilee!’
043	JOH	007	053	And everyone went home
043	JOH	008	001	except Jesus, who went to the Mount of Olives.
043	JOH	008	002	But he went again into the Temple Courts early in the morning, and all the people came to him; and he sat down and taught them.
043	JOH	008	003	Presently, however, the Teachers of the Law and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery, and placed her in the middle of the Court,
043	JOH	008	004	and said to Jesus, ‘Teacher, this woman was found in the act of adultery.
043	JOH	008	005	Now Moses, in the Law, commanded us to stone such women to death; what do you say?’
043	JOH	008	006	They said this to test him, in order to have a charge to bring against him. But Jesus stooped down, and wrote on the ground with his finger.
043	JOH	008	007	However, as they continued asking him, he raised himself, and said, ‘Let the person among you who has never done wrong throw the first stone at her.’
043	JOH	008	008	And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.
043	JOH	008	009	When they heard that, they went out one by one, beginning with the eldest; and Jesus was left alone with the woman in the middle of the Court.
043	JOH	008	010	Raising himself, Jesus said to her, ‘Woman, where are they? Did no one condemn you?’
043	JOH	008	011	‘No one, Sir,’ she answered. ‘Neither do I condemn you,’ said Jesus ‘go, and do not sin again.’
043	JOH	008	012	Jesus again addressed the people. ‘I am the light of the world,’ he said. ‘The person who follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.’
043	JOH	008	013	‘You are bearing testimony to yourself!’ exclaimed the Pharisees, ‘your testimony is not trustworthy.’
043	JOH	008	014	‘Even if I bear testimony to myself,’ answered Jesus, ‘my testimony is trustworthy; for I know where I came from, and where I am going; but you do not know where I come from, nor where I am going.
043	JOH	008	015	You judge by appearances; I judge no one.
043	JOH	008	016	Yet, even if I were to judge, my judgment would be trustworthy; because I am not alone, but the Father who sent me is with me.
043	JOH	008	017	Why, in your own Law it is said that the testimony of two persons is trustworthy.
043	JOH	008	018	I, who bear testimony to myself, am one, and the Father who sent me also bears testimony to me.’
043	JOH	008	019	‘Where is your father, then?’ they asked. ‘You know neither me nor my Father,’ replied Jesus. ‘If you had known me, you would have also known my Father.’
043	JOH	008	020	These statements Jesus made in the Treasury, while teaching in the Temple Courts. Yet no one arrested him, for his time had not then come.
043	JOH	008	021	Jesus again spoke to the people. ‘I am going away,’ he said, ‘and you will look for me, but you will die in your sin; you cannot come where I am going.’
043	JOH	008	022	‘Is he going to kill himself,’ the people exclaimed, ‘that he says – “You cannot go where I am going”?’
043	JOH	008	023	‘You,’ added Jesus, ‘are from below, I am from above; you are of this present world, I am not;
043	JOH	008	024	and so I told you that you would die in your sins, for, unless you believe that I am what I am, you will die in your sins.’
043	JOH	008	025	‘Who are you?’ they asked. ‘Why ask exactly what I have been telling you?’ said Jesus.
043	JOH	008	026	‘I have still much that concerns you to speak of and to pass judgment on; yet he who sent me may be trusted, and I speak to the world only of the things which I have heard from him.’
043	JOH	008	027	They did not understand that he meant the Father.
043	JOH	008	028	So Jesus added, ‘When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will understand that I am what I am, and that I do nothing of myself, but that I say just what the Father has taught me.
043	JOH	008	029	Moreover, he who sent me is with me; he has not left me alone; for I always do what pleases him.’
043	JOH	008	030	While he was speaking in this way, many came to believe in him.
043	JOH	008	031	So Jesus went on to say to those who had believed him, ‘If you remain constant to my message, you are truly my disciples;
043	JOH	008	032	and you will find out the truth, and the truth will set you free.’
043	JOH	008	033	‘We are descendants of Abraham,’ was their answer, ‘and have never yet been in slavery to anyone. What do you mean by saying “you will be set free”?’
043	JOH	008	034	‘In truth I tell you,’ replied Jesus, ‘everyone who sins is a slave to sin.
043	JOH	008	035	And a slave does not remain in the home always; but a son remains always.
043	JOH	008	036	If, then, the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed!
043	JOH	008	037	I know that you are descendants of Abraham; yet you are seeking to put me to death, because my message finds no place in your hearts.
043	JOH	008	038	I tell you what I have myself seen in the presence of my Father; and you, in the same way, do what you have learned from your father.’
043	JOH	008	039	‘Our father is Abraham,’ was their answer. ‘If you are Abraham’s children,’ replied Jesus, ‘do what Abraham did.
043	JOH	008	040	But, as it is, you are seeking to put me to death – a man who has told you the truth as he heard it from God. Abraham did not act in that way.
043	JOH	008	041	You are doing what your own father does.’ ‘We are not bastards,’ they said, ‘we have one Father – God himself.’
043	JOH	008	042	‘If God were your Father,’ Jesus replied, ‘you would have loved me, for I came out from God, and now am here; and I have not come of myself, but he sent me as his messenger.
043	JOH	008	043	How is it that you do not understand what I say? It is because you cannot bear to listen to my message.
043	JOH	008	044	As for you, you are children of your father the devil, and you are determined to do what your father loves to do. He was a murderer from the first, and did not stand by the truth, because there is no truth in him. Whenever he lies, he does what is natural to him; because he is a liar, and the father of lying.
043	JOH	008	045	But, as for me, it is because I speak the truth to you that you do not believe me.
043	JOH	008	046	Which of you can convict me of sin? Why then don’t you believe me, if I am speaking truth?
043	JOH	008	047	The person who comes from God listens to God’s teaching; the reason why you do not listen is because you do not come from God.’
043	JOH	008	048	‘Aren’t we right, after all,’ replied the people, ‘in saying that you are a Samaritan, and are possessed by a demon?’
043	JOH	008	049	‘I am not possessed by a demon,’ Jesus answered, ‘but I am honouring my Father; and yet you dishonour me.
043	JOH	008	050	Not that I am seeking honour for myself; there is one who is seeking my honour, and he decides.
043	JOH	008	051	In truth I tell you, if anyone lays my message to heart, he will never really die.’
043	JOH	008	052	‘Now we are sure that you are possessed by a demon,’ the people replied. ‘Abraham died, and so did the prophets; and yet you say “If anyone lays my message to heart, they will never know death.”
043	JOH	008	053	Are you greater than our ancestor Abraham, who died? And the prophets died too. Whom do you make yourself out to be?’
043	JOH	008	054	‘If I do honour to myself,’ answered Jesus, ‘such honour counts for nothing. It is my Father who does me honour – and you say that he is your God;
043	JOH	008	055	and yet you have not learned to know him; but I know him; and, if I were to say that I do not know him, I should be a liar like you; but I do know him, and I lay his message to heart.
043	JOH	008	056	Your ancestor Abraham rejoiced that he would see my day; and he did see it, and was glad.’
043	JOH	008	057	‘You are not fifty years old yet,’ the people exclaimed, ‘and have you seen Abraham?’
043	JOH	008	058	‘In truth I tell you,’ replied Jesus, ‘before Abraham existed I was.’
043	JOH	008	059	At this they took up stones to throw at him; but Jesus hid himself, and left the Temple Courts.
043	JOH	009	001	As Jesus passed by, he saw a man who had been blind from his birth.
043	JOH	009	002	‘Rabbi,’ asked his disciples, ‘who was it that sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?’
043	JOH	009	003	‘Neither the man nor the parents,’ replied Jesus, ‘but he was born blind so that the work of God should be made plain in him.
043	JOH	009	004	We must do the work of him who sent me, while it is day; night is coming, when no one can work.
043	JOH	009	005	As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.’
043	JOH	009	006	Saying this, Jesus spat on the ground, made some paste with the saliva, and put it on the man’s eyes.
043	JOH	009	007	‘Go,’ he said, ‘and wash your eyes in the Bath of Siloam’ (a word which means “messenger”). So the man went and washed his eyes, and returned able to see.
043	JOH	009	008	His neighbours, and those who had formerly known him by sight as a beggar, exclaimed, ‘Is not this the man who used to sit and beg?’
043	JOH	009	009	‘Yes,’ some said, ‘it is’; while others said, ‘No, but he is like him.’ The man himself said, ‘I am he.’
043	JOH	009	010	‘How did you get your sight, then?’ they asked.
043	JOH	009	011	‘The man whom they call Jesus,’ he answered, ‘made a paste, and anointed my eyes, and said to me “Go to Siloam and wash your eyes.” So I went and washed my eyes, and gained my sight.’
043	JOH	009	012	‘Where is he?’ they asked. ‘I do not know,’ he answered.
043	JOH	009	013	They took the man, who had been blind, to the Pharisees.
043	JOH	009	014	Now it was a Sabbath when Jesus made the paste and gave him his sight.
043	JOH	009	015	So the Pharisees also questioned the man as to how he had gained his sight. ‘He put a paste on my eyes,’ he answered, ‘and I washed them, and I can see.’
043	JOH	009	016	‘The man cannot be from God,’ said some of the Pharisees, ‘for he does not keep the Sabbath.’ ‘How is it possible,’ retorted others, ‘for a bad man to give signs like this?’
043	JOH	009	017	So there was a difference of opinion among them, and they again questioned the man. ‘What do you yourself say about him, for it is to you that he has given sight?’
043	JOH	009	018	The religious authorities, however, refused to believe that he had been blind and had gained his sight, until they had called his parents and questioned them.
043	JOH	009	019	‘Is this your son,’ they asked, ‘who you say was born blind? If so, how is it that he can see now?’
043	JOH	009	020	‘We know that this is our son,’ answered the parents, ‘and that he was born blind;
043	JOH	009	021	but how it is that he can see now we do not know; nor do we know who it was that gave him his sight. Ask him – he is old enough – he will tell you about himself.’
043	JOH	009	022	His parents spoke in this way because they were afraid of the authorities; for the authorities had already agreed that, if anyone should acknowledge Jesus as the Christ, he should be expelled from their synagogues.
043	JOH	009	023	This was why his parents said “He is old enough; ask him.”
043	JOH	009	024	So the authorities again called the man who had been blind, and said to him, ‘Give God the praise; we know that this is a bad man.’
043	JOH	009	025	‘I know nothing about his being a bad man,’ he replied. ‘One thing I do know, that although I was blind, now I can see.’
043	JOH	009	026	‘What did he do to you?’ they asked. ‘How did he give you your sight?’
043	JOH	009	027	‘I told you just now,’ he answered, ‘and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Surely you also do not want to become his disciples?’
043	JOH	009	028	‘You are his disciple,’ they retorted scornfully. ‘But we are disciples of Moses.
043	JOH	009	029	We know that God spoke to Moses; but, as for this man, we do not know where he comes from.’
043	JOH	009	030	‘Well,’ the man replied, ‘this is very strange; you do not know where he comes from, and yet he has given me my sight!
043	JOH	009	031	We know that God never listens to bad people, but, when a person is god-fearing and does God’s will, God listens to them.
043	JOH	009	032	Since the world began, such a thing was never heard of as anyone’s giving sight to a person born blind.
043	JOH	009	033	If this man had not been from God, he could not have done anything at all.’
043	JOH	009	034	‘You,’ they retorted, ‘were born totally depraved; and are you trying to teach us?’ So they expelled him.
043	JOH	009	035	Jesus heard of their having put him out; and, when he had found the man, he asked, ‘Do you believe in the Son of Man?’
043	JOH	009	036	‘Tell me who he is, Sir,’ he replied, ‘so that I may believe in him.’
043	JOH	009	037	‘Not only have you seen him,’ said Jesus, ‘but it is he who is now speaking to you.’
043	JOH	009	038	‘Then, Sir, I do believe,’ said the man, bowing to the ground before him;
043	JOH	009	039	and Jesus added, ‘It was to put people to the test that I came into this world, in order that those that cannot see should see, and that those that can see should become blind.’
043	JOH	009	040	Hearing this, some of the Pharisees who were with him said, ‘Then are we blind too?’
043	JOH	009	041	‘If you had been blind,’ replied Jesus, ‘you would have had no sin to answer for; but, as it is, you say “We can see,” and so your sin remains.
043	JOH	010	001	In truth I tell you, whoever does not go into the sheepfold through the door, but climbs up at some other place, that person is a thief and a robber;
043	JOH	010	002	but the person who goes in through the door is shepherd to the sheep.
043	JOH	010	003	For him the watchman opens the door; and the sheep listen to his voice; and he calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out.
043	JOH	010	004	When he has brought them all out, he walks in front of them, and his sheep follow him, because they know his voice.
043	JOH	010	005	They will not follow a stranger, but will run away from him; because they do not know a stranger’s voice.’
043	JOH	010	006	This was the allegory that Jesus told them, but they did not understand of what he was speaking.
043	JOH	010	007	So he continued, ‘In truth I tell you, I am the door for the sheep.
043	JOH	010	008	All who came before me were thieves and robbers; but the sheep did not listen to them.
043	JOH	010	009	I am the door; he who goes in through me will be safe, and he will go in and out and find pasture.
043	JOH	010	010	The thief comes only to steal, to kill, and to destroy; I have come so that they may have life, and may have it in greater fullness.
043	JOH	010	011	I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for his sheep.
043	JOH	010	012	The hired man who is not a shepherd, and who does not own the sheep, when he sees a wolf coming, leaves them and runs away; then the wolf seizes them, and scatters the flock.
043	JOH	010	013	He does this because he is only a hired man and does not care about the sheep.
043	JOH	010	014	I am the good shepherd; and I know my sheep, and my sheep know me –
043	JOH	010	015	Just as the Father knows me and I know the Father – and I lay down my life for the sheep.
043	JOH	010	016	I have other sheep besides, which do not belong to this fold; I must lead them also, and they will listen to my voice; and they will become one flock under one shepherd.
043	JOH	010	017	This is why the Father loves me, because I lay down my life – to receive it again.
043	JOH	010	018	No one took it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to receive it again. This is the command which I received from my Father.’
043	JOH	010	019	In consequence of these words a difference of opinion again arose among the people.
043	JOH	010	020	Many of them said, ‘He is possessed by a demon and is mad; why do you listen to him?’
043	JOH	010	021	Others said, ‘This is not the teaching of one who is possessed by a demon. Can a demon give sight to the blind?’
043	JOH	010	022	Soon after this the Festival of the Rededication was held at Jerusalem.
043	JOH	010	023	It was winter; and Jesus was walking in the Temple Courts, in the Colonnade of Solomon,
043	JOH	010	024	when the people gathered round him, and said, ‘How long are you going to keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us so frankly.’
043	JOH	010	025	‘I have told you so,’ replied Jesus, ‘and you do not believe me. The work that I am doing in my Father’s name bears testimony to me.
043	JOH	010	026	But you do not believe me, because you are not of my flock.
043	JOH	010	027	My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me;
043	JOH	010	028	and I give them eternal life, and they will not be lost; nor will anyone snatch them out of my hands.
043	JOH	010	029	What my Father has entrusted to me is more than all else; and no one can snatch anything out of the Father’s hands.
043	JOH	010	030	The Father and I are one.’
043	JOH	010	031	Some of the people again brought stones to throw at him;
043	JOH	010	032	and seeing this, Jesus said, ‘I have done before your eyes many good actions, inspired by the Father; for which of them would you stone me?’
043	JOH	010	033	‘It is not for any good action that we would stone you,’ they answered, ‘but for blasphemy; and because you, who are only a man, make yourself out to be God.’
043	JOH	010	034	‘Are there not,’ replied Jesus, ‘these words in your Law – “I said, You are gods”?
043	JOH	010	035	If those to whom God’s word were addressed were said to be “gods” – and scripture cannot be set aside –
043	JOH	010	036	do you say of one whom the Father has consecrated and sent as his messenger to the world “You are blaspheming,” because I said “I am God’s Son”?
043	JOH	010	037	If I am not doing the work that my Father is doing, do not believe me;
043	JOH	010	038	if I am doing it, even though you do not believe me, believe what that work shows; so that you may understand, and understand more and more clearly, that the Father is in union with me, and I with the Father.’
043	JOH	010	039	The authorities again sought to arrest him; but he escaped their hands.
043	JOH	010	040	Then Jesus again crossed the Jordan to the place where John used to baptise at first, and stayed there some time, during which many people came to see him.
043	JOH	010	041	‘John gave no sign of his mission,’ they said. ‘But everything that he said about this man was true.’
043	JOH	010	042	And many learned to believe in Jesus there.
043	JOH	011	001	Now a man named Lazarus, of Bethany, was lying ill; he belonged to the same village as Mary and her sister Martha.
043	JOH	011	002	This Mary, whose brother Lazarus was ill, was the Mary who anointed the Master with perfume, and wiped his feet with her hair.
043	JOH	011	003	The sisters, therefore, sent this message to Jesus – “Master, your friend is ill”;
043	JOH	011	004	and, when Jesus heard it, he said, ‘This illness is not to end in death, but is to redound to the honour of God, in order that the Son of God may be honoured through it.’
043	JOH	011	005	Jesus loved Martha and her sister, and Lazarus.
043	JOH	011	006	Yet, when he heard of the illness of Lazarus, he still stayed two days in the place where he was.
043	JOH	011	007	Then, after that, he said to his disciples, ‘Let us go to Judea again.’
043	JOH	011	008	‘Rabbi,’ they replied, ‘the authorities there were but just now seeking to stone you; and are you going there again?’
043	JOH	011	009	‘Are not there twelve hours in the day?’ answered Jesus. ‘If someone walks about in the daytime, they don’t stumble, because they can see the light of the sun;
043	JOH	011	010	but, if they walk about at night, they stumble, because they have not the light.’
043	JOH	011	011	And, when he had said this, he added, ‘Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep; but I am going so that I may wake him.’
043	JOH	011	012	‘If he has fallen asleep, Master, he will get well,’ said the disciples.
043	JOH	011	013	But Jesus meant that he was dead; they, however, supposed that he was speaking of natural sleep.
043	JOH	011	014	Then he said to them plainly, ‘Lazarus is dead;
043	JOH	011	015	and I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, so that you may learn to believe in me. But let us go to him.’
043	JOH	011	016	At this, Thomas, who was called “The Twin,” said to his fellow disciples, ‘Let us go too, so that we may die with him.’
043	JOH	011	017	When Jesus reached the place, he found that Lazarus had been four days in the tomb already.
043	JOH	011	018	Bethany being only about two miles from Jerusalem,
043	JOH	011	019	a number of the people had come there to comfort Martha and Mary because of their brother’s death.
043	JOH	011	020	When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went to meet him; but Mary sat quietly at home.
043	JOH	011	021	‘Master,’ Martha said to Jesus, ‘if you had been here, my brother would not have died.
043	JOH	011	022	Even now, I know that God will grant you whatever you ask him.’
043	JOH	011	023	‘Your brother will rise to life,’ said Jesus.
043	JOH	011	024	‘I know that he will,’ replied Martha, ‘in the resurrection at the Last day.’
043	JOH	011	025	‘I am the resurrection and the life,’ said Jesus. ‘He who believes in me will live, though he die;
043	JOH	011	026	and he who lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?’
043	JOH	011	027	‘Yes Master,’ she answered. ‘I have learned to believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world.’
043	JOH	011	028	After saying this, Martha went and called her sister Mary, and whispered, ‘The teacher is here, and is asking for you.’
043	JOH	011	029	As soon as Mary heard that, she got up quickly, and went to meet him.
043	JOH	011	030	Jesus had not then come into the village, but was still at the place where Martha had met him.
043	JOH	011	031	So the people, who were in the house with Mary, comforting her, when they saw her get up quickly and go out, followed her, thinking that she was going to the tomb to weep there.
043	JOH	011	032	When Mary came where Jesus was and saw him, she threw herself at his feet. ‘Master,’ she exclaimed, ‘if you had been here, my brother would not have died!’
043	JOH	011	033	When Jesus saw her weeping, and the people who had come with her weeping also, he groaned deeply, and was greatly distressed.
043	JOH	011	034	‘Where have you buried him?’ he asked. ‘Come and see, Master,’ they answered.
043	JOH	011	035	Jesus burst into tears.
043	JOH	011	036	‘How he must have loved him!’ the people exclaimed;
043	JOH	011	037	but some of them said, ‘Could not this man, who gave sight to the blind man, have also prevented Lazarus from dying?’
043	JOH	011	038	Again groaning inwardly, Jesus came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone lay against the mouth of it.
043	JOH	011	039	‘Move the stone away,’ said Jesus. ‘Master,’ said Martha, the sister of the dead man, ‘by this time the smell must be offensive, for this is the fourth day since his death.’
043	JOH	011	040	‘Didn’t I tell you,’ replied Jesus, ‘that, if you would believe in me, you should see the glory of God?’
043	JOH	011	041	So they moved the stone away; and Jesus, with uplifted eyes, said, ‘Father, I thank you that you have heard my prayer.
043	JOH	011	042	I know that you always hear me; but I say this for the sake of the people standing near, so that they may believe that you have sent me as your messenger.’
043	JOH	011	043	Then, after saying this, Jesus called in a loud voice, ‘Lazarus! Come out!’
043	JOH	011	044	The dead man came out, wrapped hand and foot in a winding-sheet; his face, too, had been wrapped in a cloth. ‘Set him free,’ said Jesus, ‘and let him go.’
043	JOH	011	045	In consequence of this, many of the people, who had come to visit Mary and had seen what Jesus did, put their faith in him.
043	JOH	011	046	Some of them, however, went to the Pharisees, and told them what he had done.
043	JOH	011	047	The chief priests and the Pharisees called a meeting of the High Council, and said, ‘What are we to do, now that this man is giving so many signs?
043	JOH	011	048	If we allow him to continue as we are doing, everyone will believe in him; and the Romans will come and will take from us both our Temple and our nation.’
043	JOH	011	049	One of them, however, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them,
043	JOH	011	050	‘You are utterly mistaken. You do not consider that it is better for you that one person should die for the people, rather than the whole nation should be destroyed.’
043	JOH	011	051	Now he did not say this of his own accord; but, as high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus was to die for the nation –
043	JOH	011	052	And not for the nation only, but also that he might unite in one body the children of God now scattered far and wide.
043	JOH	011	053	So from that day they plotted to put Jesus to death.
043	JOH	011	054	In consequence of this, Jesus did not go about publicly among the people any more, but left and went into the country bordering on the wilderness, to a town called Ephraim, where he stayed with his disciples.
043	JOH	011	055	But the Jewish Festival of the Passover was near; and many people had gone up from the country to Jerusalem, for their purification, before the Festival began.
043	JOH	011	056	So they looked for Jesus there, and said to one another, as they stood in the Temple Courts, ‘What do you think? Do you think he will come to the Festival?’
043	JOH	011	057	The chief priests and the Pharisees had already issued orders that, if anyone learned where Jesus was, he should give information, so that they might arrest him.
043	JOH	012	001	Six days before the Passover Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead, was living.
043	JOH	012	002	There a supper was given in his honour at which Martha waited, while Lazarus was one of those present at the table.
043	JOH	012	003	So Mary took a pound of choice spikenard perfume of great value, and anointed the feet of Jesus with it, and then wiped them with her hair. The whole house was filled with the scent of the perfume.
043	JOH	012	004	One of the disciples, Judas Iscariot, who was about to betray Jesus, asked,
043	JOH	012	005	‘Why was not this perfume sold for a year’s wages, and the money given to poor people?’
043	JOH	012	006	He said this, not because he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and, being in charge of the purse, used to take what was put in it.
043	JOH	012	007	‘Leave her alone,’ said Jesus, ‘so that she may keep it until the day when my body is being prepared for burial.
043	JOH	012	008	The poor you always have with you, but you will not always have me.’
043	JOH	012	009	Now great numbers of people found out that Jesus was at Bethany; and they came there, not only because of him, but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.
043	JOH	012	010	The chief priests, however, plotted to put Lazarus, as well as Jesus, to death,
043	JOH	012	011	because it was owing to him that many of the people had left them, and were becoming believers in Jesus.
043	JOH	012	012	On the following day great numbers of people who had come to the Festival, hearing that Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem, took palm branches,
043	JOH	012	013	and went out to meet him, shouting as they went, ‘God save him! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord – the king of Israel!’
043	JOH	012	014	Having found a young donkey, Jesus seated himself on it, in accordance with the passage of scripture –
043	JOH	012	015	“Fear not, people of Zion. Your king is coming to you, sitting on the foal of a donkey.”
043	JOH	012	016	His disciples did not understand all this at first; but, when Jesus had been exalted, then they remembered that these things had been said of him in scripture, and that they had done these things for him.
043	JOH	012	017	Meanwhile the people who were with him, when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead, were telling what they had seen.
043	JOH	012	018	This, indeed, was why the crowd met him – because people had heard that he had given this sign of his mission.
043	JOH	012	019	So the Pharisees said to one another, ‘You see that you are gaining nothing! Why, all the world has run after him!’
043	JOH	012	020	Among those who were going up to worship at the Festival were some Greeks,
043	JOH	012	021	who went to Philip of Bethsaida in Galilee, and said, ‘Sir, we wish to see Jesus.’
043	JOH	012	022	Philip went and told Andrew, and then together they went and told Jesus.
043	JOH	012	023	This was his reply – ‘The time has come for the Son of Man to be exalted.
043	JOH	012	024	In truth I tell you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains solitary; but, if it dies, it becomes fruitful.
043	JOH	012	025	A person who loves their life loses it; while someone who hates their life in the present world will preserve it for eternal life.
043	JOH	012	026	If someone is ready to serve me, let them follow me; and where I am, there my servant will be also. If a person is ready to serve me, my Father will honour them.
043	JOH	012	027	Now I am distressed at heart and what can I say? Father, bring me safe through this hour – yet it was for this reason that I came to this hour –
043	JOH	012	028	Father, honour your own name.’ At this there came a voice from heaven, which said, ‘I have already honoured it, and I will honour it again.’
043	JOH	012	029	The crowd of bystanders, who heard the sound, said that it was thundering. Others said, ‘An angel has been speaking to him.’
043	JOH	012	030	‘It was not for my sake that the voice came,’ said Jesus, ‘but for yours.
043	JOH	012	031	Now this world is on its trial. Now the Spirit that is ruling this world will be driven out;
043	JOH	012	032	and I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself.’
043	JOH	012	033	By these words he indicated what death he was destined to die.
043	JOH	012	034	‘We,’ replied the people, ‘have learned from the Law that the Christ is to remain for ever; how is it, then, that you say that the Son of Man must be “lifted up” Who is this “Son of Man”?’
043	JOH	012	035	‘Only a little while longer,’ answered Jesus, ‘will you have the light among you. Travel on while you have the light, so that darkness may not overtake you; he who travels in the darkness does not know where he is going.
043	JOH	012	036	While you still have the light, believe in the light, so that you may be children of light.’ After he had said this, Jesus went away, and hid himself from them.
043	JOH	012	037	But, though Jesus had given so many signs of his mission before their eyes, they still did not believe in him,
043	JOH	012	038	in fulfilment of the words of the prophet Isaiah, where he says – “Lord, who has believed our teaching? And to whom has the might of the Lord been revealed?”
043	JOH	012	039	The reason why they were unable to believe is given by Isaiah elsewhere, in these words –
043	JOH	012	040	“He has blinded their eyes, and blunted their mind, so that they should not see with their eyes, and perceive with their mind, and turn – And I should heal them.”
043	JOH	012	041	Isaiah said this, because he saw Christ’s glory; and it was of him that he spoke.
043	JOH	012	042	Yet for all this, even among the leading men there were many who came to believe in Jesus; but, because of the Pharisees, they did not acknowledge it, because they were afraid that they should be expelled from their synagogues;
043	JOH	012	043	for they valued honour from people more than honour from God.
043	JOH	012	044	But Jesus had proclaimed, ‘He who believes in me believes, not in me, but in him who sent me;
043	JOH	012	045	and he who sees me sees him who sent me.
043	JOH	012	046	I have come as a light into the world, so that no one who believes in me should remain in the darkness.
043	JOH	012	047	When anyone hears my teaching and pays no heed to it, I am not his judge; for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.
043	JOH	012	048	He who rejects me, and disregards my teaching, has a judge already – the message which I have delivered will itself be his judge at the Last day.
043	JOH	012	049	For I have not delivered it on my own authority; but the Father, who sent me, has himself given me his command as to what I should say, and what message I should deliver.
043	JOH	012	050	And I know that eternal life lies in keeping his command. Therefore, whatever I say, I say only what the Father has taught me.’
043	JOH	013	001	Before the Passover Festival began, Jesus knew that the time had come for him to leave the world and go to the Father. He had loved those who were his own in the world, and he loved them to the last.
043	JOH	013	002	The devil had already put the thought of betraying Jesus into the mind of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon;
043	JOH	013	003	and at supper, Jesus – although knowing that the Father had put everything into his hands, and that he had come from God, and was to return to God –
043	JOH	013	004	rose from his place, and, taking off his upper garments, tied a towel round his waist.
043	JOH	013	005	He then poured some water into the basin, and began to wash the disciples’ feet, and to wipe them with the towel which was tied round him.
043	JOH	013	006	When he came to Simon Peter, Peter said, ‘You, Master! Are you going to wash my feet?’
043	JOH	013	007	‘You do not understand now what I am doing,’ replied Jesus, ‘but you will learn by and by.’
043	JOH	013	008	‘You will never wash my feet!’ exclaimed Peter. ‘Unless I wash you,’ answered Jesus, ‘you have nothing in common with me.’
043	JOH	013	009	‘Then, Master, not my feet only,’ exclaimed Simon Peter, ‘but also my hands and my head.’
043	JOH	013	010	‘He who has bathed,’ replied Jesus, ‘has no need to wash, unless it be his feet, but is altogether clean; and you,’ he said to the disciples, ‘are clean, yet not all of you.’
043	JOH	013	011	For he knew who was going to betray him, and that was why he said “You are not all clean.”
043	JOH	013	012	When he had washed their feet, and had put on his upper garments and taken his place, he spoke to them again. ‘Do you understand what I have been doing to you?’ he asked.
043	JOH	013	013	‘You yourselves call me “the teacher” and “the Master”, and you are right, for I am both.
043	JOH	013	014	If I, then – “the Master” and “the teacher” – have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet;
043	JOH	013	015	for I have given you an example, so that you may do just as I have done to you.
043	JOH	013	016	In truth I tell you, a servant is not greater than their master, neither is a messenger greater than the one who sends them.
043	JOH	013	017	Now that you know these things, happy are you if you do them.
043	JOH	013	018	I am not speaking about all of you. I know whom I have chosen; but this is in fulfilment of the words of scripture – “He that is eating my bread has lifted his heel against me.”
043	JOH	013	019	For the future I will tell you of things before they take place, so that, when they take place, you may believe that I am what I am.
043	JOH	013	020	In truth I tell you, the one who receives anyone that I send receives me; and the person who receives me receives him who sent me.’
043	JOH	013	021	After saying this, Jesus was much troubled, and said solemnly, ‘In truth I tell you that it is one of you who will betray me.’
043	JOH	013	022	The disciples looked at one another, wondering whom he meant.
043	JOH	013	023	Next to Jesus, in the place on his right hand, was one of his disciples, whom he loved.
043	JOH	013	024	So Simon Peter made signs to that disciple, and whispered, ‘Tell me who it is that he means.’
043	JOH	013	025	Being in this position, that disciple leant back on Jesus’ shoulder, and asked him, ‘Who is it, Master?’
043	JOH	013	026	‘It is the one,’ answered Jesus, ‘to whom I will give a piece of bread after dipping it in the dish.’ And, when Jesus had dipped the bread, he took it and gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot;
043	JOH	013	027	and it was then, after he had received it, that Satan took possession of him. So Jesus said to him, ‘Do at once what you are going to do.’
043	JOH	013	028	But no one at the table understood why he said this to Judas.
043	JOH	013	029	Some thought that, as Judas kept the purse, Jesus meant that he was to buy some things needed for the Festival, or to give something to the poor.
043	JOH	013	030	After taking the piece of bread, Judas went out immediately; and it was night.
043	JOH	013	031	When Judas had gone out, Jesus said, ‘Now the Son of Man has been exalted, and God has been exalted through him;
043	JOH	013	032	and God will exalt him with himself – yes, he will exalt him forthwith.
043	JOH	013	033	My children, I am to be with you but a little while longer. You will look for me; and what I said to the people – “You cannot come where I am going” – I now say to you.
043	JOH	013	034	I give you a new commandment – love one another; love one another as I have loved you.
043	JOH	013	035	It is by this that everyone will recognise you as my disciples – by your loving one another.’
043	JOH	013	036	‘Where are you going, Master?’ asked Peter. ‘I am going where you cannot now follow me,’ answered Jesus, ‘but you will follow me later.’
043	JOH	013	037	‘Why cannot I follow you now, Master?’ asked Peter. ‘I will lay down my life for you.’
043	JOH	013	038	‘Will you lay down your life for me?’ replied Jesus. ‘In truth I tell you, the cock will not crow until you have disowned me three times.
043	JOH	014	001	Do not let your hearts be troubled. Believe in God; believe also in me.
043	JOH	014	002	In my Father’s home there are many dwellings. If it had not been so, I should have told you, for I am going to prepare a place for you.
043	JOH	014	003	And, since I go and prepare a place for you, I will return and take you to be with me, so that you may be where I am;
043	JOH	014	004	and you know the way to the place where I am going.’
043	JOH	014	005	‘We do not know where you are going, Master,’ said Thomas. ‘So how can we know the way?’
043	JOH	014	006	Jesus answered, ‘I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one ever comes to the Father except through me.
043	JOH	014	007	If you had recognised me, you would have known my Father also; for the future you will recognise him, indeed you have already seen him.’
043	JOH	014	008	‘Master, show us the Father,’ said Philip, ‘and we will be satisfied.’
043	JOH	014	009	‘Have I been all this time among you,’ said Jesus, ‘and yet you, Philip, have not recognised me? The person who has seen me has seen the Father, how can you say, then, “Show us the Father”?
043	JOH	014	010	Don’t you believe that I am in union with the Father, and the Father with me? In giving you my teaching I am not speaking on my own authority; but the Father himself, always in union with me, does his own work.
043	JOH	014	011	Believe me,’ he said to them all, ‘when I say that I am in union with the Father and the Father with me, or else believe me because of the work itself.
043	JOH	014	012	In truth I tell you, the person who believes in me will themselves do the work that I am doing; and they will do greater work still, because I am going to the Father.
043	JOH	014	013	Whatever you ask, in my name, I will do, so that the Father may be honoured in the Son.
043	JOH	014	014	If you ask anything, in my name, I will do it.
043	JOH	014	015	If you love me, you will lay my commands to heart,
043	JOH	014	016	and I will ask the Father, and he will give you another helper, to be with you always – the Spirit of truth.
043	JOH	014	017	The world cannot receive this Spirit, because it does not see him or recognise him, but you recognise him, because he is always with you, and is within you.
043	JOH	014	018	I will not leave you bereaved; I will come to you.
043	JOH	014	019	In a little while the world will see me no more, but you will still see me; because I am living, you will be living also.
043	JOH	014	020	At that time you will recognise that I am in union with the Father, and you with me, and I with you.
043	JOH	014	021	It is the person who has my commands and lays them to heart who loves me; and the person who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love them, and will reveal myself to them.’
043	JOH	014	022	‘What has happened, Master,’ said Judas (not Judas Iscariot), ‘that you are going to reveal yourself to us, and not to the world?’
043	JOH	014	023	‘Whoever loves me,’ Jesus answered, ‘will lay my message to heart; and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our home with him.
043	JOH	014	024	The person who does not love me will not lay my message to heart; and the message to which you are listening is not my own, but comes from the Father who sent me.
043	JOH	014	025	I have told you all this while still with you,
043	JOH	014	026	but the helper – the Holy Spirit whom the Father will send in my name – will teach you all things, and will recall to your minds all that I have said to you.
043	JOH	014	027	Peace be with you! My own peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled, or dismayed.
043	JOH	014	028	You heard me say that I was going away and would return to you. Had you loved me, you would have been glad that I was going to the Father, because the Father is greater than I.
043	JOH	014	029	And this I have told you now before it happens, so that, when it does happen, you may still believe in me.
043	JOH	014	030	I will not talk with you much more, for the Spirit that is ruling the world is coming. He has nothing in common with me;
043	JOH	014	031	but he is coming so that the world may see that I love the Father, and that I do as the Father commanded me. Come, let us be going.
043	JOH	015	001	‘I am the true vine, and my Father is the vine-grower.
043	JOH	015	002	Any unfruitful branch in me he takes away, and he cleanses every fruitful branch, so that it may bear more fruit.
043	JOH	015	003	You are already clean because of the message that I have given you.
043	JOH	015	004	Remain united to me, and I will remain united to you. As a branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it remains united to the vine; no more can you, unless you remain united to me.
043	JOH	015	005	I am the vine, you are the branches. If you remain united to me, while I remain united to you – you bear fruit plentifully; for you can do nothing apart from me.
043	JOH	015	006	If anyone does not remain united to me, they are thrown away, as a branch would be, and withers up. Such branches are collected and thrown into the fire, and are burnt.
043	JOH	015	007	If you remain united to me, and my teaching remains in your hearts, ask whatever you wish, and it will be yours.
043	JOH	015	008	It is by your bearing fruit plentifully, and so showing yourselves my disciples, that my Father is honoured.
043	JOH	015	009	As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you; remain in my love.
043	JOH	015	010	If you lay my commands to heart, you will remain in my love; just as I have laid the Father’s commands to heart and remain in his love.
043	JOH	015	011	I have told you all this so that my own joy may be yours, and that your joy may be complete.
043	JOH	015	012	This is my command – love one another, as I have loved you.
043	JOH	015	013	No one can give greater proof of love than by laying down their life for their friends.
043	JOH	015	014	And you are my friends, if you do what I command you.
043	JOH	015	015	I no longer call you “servants,” because a servant does not know what their master is doing; but I have given you the name of “friends,” because I made known to you everything that I learned from my Father.
043	JOH	015	016	It wasn’t you who chose me, but I who chose you, and I appointed you to go and bear fruit – fruit that should remain, so that the Father might grant you whatever you ask in my name.
043	JOH	015	017	I am giving you these commands that you may love one another.
043	JOH	015	018	If the world hates you, you know that it has first hated me.
043	JOH	015	019	If you belonged to the world, the world would love its own. Because you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world – that is why the world hates you.
043	JOH	015	020	Remember what I said to you – “A servant is not greater than their master.” If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have laid my message to heart, they will lay yours to heart also.
043	JOH	015	021	But they will do all this to you, because you believe in my name, for they do not know him who sent me.
043	JOH	015	022	If I had not come and spoken to them, they would have had no sin to answer for; but as it is, they have no excuse for their sin.
043	JOH	015	023	The person who hates me hates my Father also.
043	JOH	015	024	If I had not done among them such work as no one else ever did, they would have had no sin to answer for; but, as it is, they have both seen and hated both me and my Father.
043	JOH	015	025	And so is fulfilled what is said in their Law – “They hated me without cause.”
043	JOH	015	026	But, when the helper comes, whom I will send to you from the Father – the Spirit of truth, who comes from the Father – will bear testimony to me;
043	JOH	015	027	yes, and you also are to bear testimony, because you have been with me from the first.
043	JOH	016	001	‘I have spoken to you in this way so that you may not falter.
043	JOH	016	002	They will expel you from their synagogues; indeed the time is coming when anyone who kills you will think that they are making an offering to God.
043	JOH	016	003	They will do this, because they have not learned to know the Father, or even me.
043	JOH	016	004	But I have spoken to you of these things so that, when the time for them comes, you may remember that I told you about them myself.
043	JOH	016	005	I did not tell you all this at first, because I was with you. But now I am to return to him who sent me; and yet not one of you asks me – “Where are you going?”
043	JOH	016	006	Although your hearts are full of sorrow at all that I have been saying to you.
043	JOH	016	007	Yet I am only telling you the truth; it is for your good that I should go away. For otherwise the helper will never come to you, but, if I leave you, I will send him to you.
043	JOH	016	008	And he, when he comes, will bring conviction to the world as to sin, and as to righteousness, and as to judgment;
043	JOH	016	009	as to sin, for people do not believe in me;
043	JOH	016	010	as to righteousness, for I am going to the Father, and you will see me no longer;
043	JOH	016	011	as to judgment, for the Spirit that is ruling this world has been condemned.
043	JOH	016	012	I have still much to say to you, but you cannot bear it now.
043	JOH	016	013	Yet when he – The Spirit of truth – comes, he will guide you into all truth; for he will not speak on his own authority, but he will speak of all that he hears; and he will tell you of the things that are to come.
043	JOH	016	014	He will honour me; because he will take of what is mine, and will tell it to you.
043	JOH	016	015	Everything that the Father has is mine; that is why I said that he takes of what is mine, and will tell it to you.
043	JOH	016	016	In a little while you will no longer see me; and then in a little while you will see me indeed.’
043	JOH	016	017	At this some of his disciples said to one another, ‘What does he mean by saying to us “In a little while you will not see me, and then in a little while you will see me indeed”; and by saying “Because I am going to the Father”?
043	JOH	016	018	What does he mean by “In a little while”?’ they said. ‘We do not know what he is speaking about.’
043	JOH	016	019	Jesus saw that they were wanting to ask him a question, and said, ‘Are you trying to find out from one another what I meant by saying “In a little while you will not see me; and then in a little while you will see me indeed”?
043	JOH	016	020	In truth I tell you that you will weep and mourn, but the world will rejoice; you will suffer pain, but your pain will turn to joy.
043	JOH	016	021	A woman in labour is in pain because her time has come; but no sooner is the child born, than she forgets her trouble in her joy that a child has been born into the world.
043	JOH	016	022	You, in the same way, are sorry now; but I will see you again, and your hearts will rejoice, and no one will rob you of your joy.
043	JOH	016	023	And at that time you will not ask me anything; in truth I tell you, if you ask the Father for anything, he will grant it to you in my name.
043	JOH	016	024	So far you have not asked for anything, in my name; ask, and you will receive, so that your joy may be complete.
043	JOH	016	025	I have spoken to you of all this in figures; a time is coming, however, when I will not speak any longer to you in figures, but will tell you about the Father plainly.
043	JOH	016	026	You will ask, at that time, in my name; and I do not say that I will intercede with the Father for you;
043	JOH	016	027	for the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me, and have believed that I came from the Father.
043	JOH	016	028	I came out from the Father, and have come into the world; and now I am to leave the world, and go to the Father.’
043	JOH	016	029	‘At last,’ exclaimed the disciples, ‘you are using plain words and not speaking in figures at all.
043	JOH	016	030	Now we are sure that you know everything, and need not wait for anyone to question you. This makes us believe that you did come from God.’
043	JOH	016	031	‘Do you believe that already?’ Jesus answered.
043	JOH	016	032	‘Listen! A time is coming – indeed it has already come – when you are to be scattered, each going his own way, and to leave me alone; and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.
043	JOH	016	033	I have spoken to you in this way, so that in me you may find peace. In the world you will find trouble; yet, take courage! I have conquered the world.’
043	JOH	017	001	After saying this, Jesus raised his eyes heavenwards, and said: ‘Father, the hour has come; honour your Son, so that your Son may honour you;
043	JOH	017	002	even as you gave him power over all humanity, so that he should give eternal life to everyone you have given him.
043	JOH	017	003	And the eternal life is this – to know you the one true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent as your messenger.
043	JOH	017	004	I have honoured you on earth by completing the work which you have given me to do;
043	JOH	017	005	and now do you honour me, Father, at your own side, with the honour which I had at your side before the world began.
043	JOH	017	006	I have revealed you to those whom you gave me from the world; they were your own, and you gave them to me; and they have laid your message to heart.
043	JOH	017	007	They recognise now that everything that you gave me was from you;
043	JOH	017	008	for I have given them the teaching which you gave me, and they received it, and clearly understood that I came from you, and they believed that you have sent me as your messenger.
043	JOH	017	009	I intercede for them; I am not interceding for the world, but for those whom you have given me, for they are your own –
043	JOH	017	010	All that is mine is yours, and all that is yours is mine – and I am honoured in them.
043	JOH	017	011	Now I am to be in this world no longer, but they are still to be in the world, and I am to come to you. Holy Father, keep them by that revelation of your name which you have given me, so that they may be one, as we are.
043	JOH	017	012	While I was with them, I kept them by that revelation, and I have guarded them; and not one of them has been lost, except that lost soul – in fulfilment of scripture.
043	JOH	017	013	But now I am to come to you; and I am speaking like this, while still in the world, so that they may have my own joy, in all its fullness, in their hearts.
043	JOH	017	014	I have given them your message; and the world hated them, because they do not belong to the world, even as I do not belong to the world.
043	JOH	017	015	I do not ask you to take them out of the world, but to keep them from evil.
043	JOH	017	016	They do not belong to the world, even as I do not belong to the world.
043	JOH	017	017	Consecrate them by the truth; your message is truth.
043	JOH	017	018	Just as you have sent me as your messenger to the world, so I send them as my messengers to the world.
043	JOH	017	019	And it is for their sakes that I am consecrating myself, so that they also may be truly consecrated.
043	JOH	017	020	But it is not only for them that I am interceding, but also for those who believe in me through their message,
043	JOH	017	021	that they all may be one – that as you, Father, are in union with us – and so the world may believe that you have sent me as your messenger.
043	JOH	017	022	I have given them the honour which you have given me, so that they may be one as we are one –
043	JOH	017	023	I in union with them and you with me – so that they may be perfected in their union, and so that the world may know that you have sent me as your messenger, and that you have loved them as you have loved me.
043	JOH	017	024	Father, my desire for all those whom you have given me is that they may be with me where I am, so that they may see the honour which you have given me; for you did love me before the beginning of the world.
043	JOH	017	025	Righteous Father, though the world did not know you, I knew you; and these people knew that you have sent me as your messenger.
043	JOH	017	026	I have made you known to them, and will do so still; that the love that you have had for me may be in their hearts, and that I may be in them also.’
043	JOH	018	001	When Jesus had said this, he went out with his disciples and crossed the Kidron ravine to a place where there was a garden, into which he and his disciples went.
043	JOH	018	002	The place was well known to Judas, the betrayer, for Jesus and his disciples had often met there.
043	JOH	018	003	So Judas, who had obtained the soldiers of the Roman garrison, and some guards from the chief priests and the Pharisees, came there with lanterns, torches, and weapons.
043	JOH	018	004	Jesus, aware of all that was coming upon him, went to meet them, and said to them, ‘For whom are you looking?’
043	JOH	018	005	‘Jesus of Nazareth,’ was their answer. ‘I am he,’ said Jesus. (Judas, the betrayer, was also standing with them.)
043	JOH	018	006	When Jesus said “I am he,” they drew back and fell to the ground.
043	JOH	018	007	So he again asked for whom they were looking, and they answered, ‘Jesus of Nazareth.’
043	JOH	018	008	‘I have already told you that I am he,’ replied Jesus, ‘so, if it is for me that you are looking, let these people go.’
043	JOH	018	009	This was in fulfilment of his words – “Of those whom you have given me I have not lost one.”
043	JOH	018	010	At this, Simon Peter, who had a sword with him, drew it, and struck the high priest’s servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant’s name was Malchus.
043	JOH	018	011	But Jesus said to Peter, ‘Sheathe your sword. Should I not drink the cup which the Father has given me?’
043	JOH	018	012	So the soldiers of the garrison, with their commanding officer and the Jewish guards, arrested Jesus and bound him,
043	JOH	018	013	and took him first of all to Annas. Annas was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.
043	JOH	018	014	It was Caiaphas who had counselled the religious authorities, that it was best that one person should die for the people.
043	JOH	018	015	Meanwhile Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple. That disciple, being well-known to the high priest, went with Jesus into the high priest’s courtyard,
043	JOH	018	016	while Peter stood outside by the door. Presently the other disciple – the one well-known to the high priest – went out and spoke to the portress, and brought Peter in.
043	JOH	018	017	So the maidservant said to Peter, ‘Aren’t you also one of this man’s disciples?’ ‘No, I am not,’ he said.
043	JOH	018	018	The servants and guards were standing round a charcoal fire (which they had made because it was cold), and were warming themselves. Peter, too, was with them, standing and warming himself.
043	JOH	018	019	The high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and about his teaching.
043	JOH	018	020	‘For my part,’ answered Jesus, ‘I have spoken to all the world openly. I always taught in some synagogue, or in the Temple Courts, places where everyone assembles, and I never spoke of anything in secret.
043	JOH	018	021	Why question me? Question those who have listened to me as to what I have spoken about to them. They must know what I said.’
043	JOH	018	022	When Jesus said this, one of the guards, who was standing near, gave him a blow with his hand. ‘Do you answer the high priest like that?’ he exclaimed.
043	JOH	018	023	‘If I said anything wrong, give evidence about it,’ replied Jesus, ‘but if not, why do you strike me?’
043	JOH	018	024	Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.
043	JOH	018	025	Meanwhile Simon Peter was standing there, warming himself; so they said to him, ‘Aren’t you also one of his disciples?’ Peter denied it. ‘No, I am not,’ he said.
043	JOH	018	026	One of the high priest’s servants, a relation of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, exclaimed, ‘Didn’t I myself see you with him in the garden?’
043	JOH	018	027	Peter again denied it; and at that moment a cock crowed.
043	JOH	018	028	From Caiaphas they took Jesus to the Government house. It was early in the morning. But they did not enter the Government house themselves, otherwise they might become defiled, and so be unable to eat the Passover.
043	JOH	018	029	Therefore Pilate came outside to speak to them. ‘What charge do you bring against this man?’ he asked.
043	JOH	018	030	‘If he had not been a criminal, we should not have given him up to you,’ they answered.
043	JOH	018	031	‘Take him yourselves,’ said Pilate, ‘and try him by your own Law.’ ‘We have no power to put anyone to death,’ the authorities replied –
043	JOH	018	032	in fulfilment of what Jesus had said when indicating the death that he was destined to die.
043	JOH	018	033	After that, Pilate went into the Government house again, and calling Jesus up, asked him, ‘Are you the king of the Jews?’
043	JOH	018	034	‘Do you ask me that yourself?’ replied Jesus, ‘or did others say it to you about me?’
043	JOH	018	035	‘Do you take me for a Jew?’ was Pilate’s answer. ‘It is your own nation and the chief priests who have given you up to me. What have you done?’
043	JOH	018	036	‘My kingly power,’ replied Jesus, ‘is not due to this world. If it had been so, my servants would be doing their utmost to prevent my being given up to the authorities; but my kingly power is not from the world.’
043	JOH	018	037	‘So you are a king after all!’ exclaimed Pilate. ‘Yes, it is true I am a king,’ answered Jesus. ‘I was born for this, I have come into the world for this – to bear testimony to the truth. Everyone who is on the side of truth listens to my voice.’
043	JOH	018	038	‘What is truth?’ exclaimed Pilate. After saying this, he went out to the crowd again, and said, ‘For my part, I find nothing with which he can be charged.
043	JOH	018	039	It is, however, the custom for me to grant you the release of one man at the Passover Festival. Do you wish for the release of the king of the Jews?’
043	JOH	018	040	‘No, not this man,’ they shouted again, ‘but Barabbas!’ This Barabbas was a robber.
043	JOH	019	001	After that, Pilate had Jesus scourged.
043	JOH	019	002	The soldiers made a crown with some thorns and put it on his head and threw a purple robe round him.
043	JOH	019	003	They kept coming up to him and saying, ‘Long live the king of the Jews!’ and they gave him blow after blow with their hands.
043	JOH	019	004	Pilate again came outside, and said to the people, ‘Look! I am bringing him out to you, so that you may know that I find nothing with which he can be charged.’
043	JOH	019	005	Then Jesus came outside, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe; and Pilate said to them, ‘Here is the man!’
043	JOH	019	006	When the chief priests and the guards saw him, they shouted, ‘Crucify him! Crucify him!’ ‘Take him yourselves and crucify him,’ said Pilate. ‘For my part, I find nothing with which he can be charged.’
043	JOH	019	007	‘But we,’ replied the crowd, ‘have a Law, under which he deserves death for making himself out to be the Son of God.’
043	JOH	019	008	When Pilate heard what they said, he became still more alarmed;
043	JOH	019	009	and, going into the Government house again, he said to Jesus, ‘Where do you come from?’
043	JOH	019	010	But Jesus made no reply. So Pilate said to him, ‘Do you refuse to speak to me? Don’t you know that I have power to release you, and have power to crucify you?’
043	JOH	019	011	‘You would have no power over me at all,’ answered Jesus, ‘if it had not been given you from above; and, therefore, the man who betrayed me to you is guilty of the greater sin.’
043	JOH	019	012	This made Pilate anxious to release him; but the crowd shouted, ‘If you release that man, you are no friend of the Emperor! Anyone who makes himself out to be a king is setting himself against the Emperor!’
043	JOH	019	013	On hearing what they said, Pilate brought Jesus out, and took his seat on the Bench at a place called “The Stone Pavement” – in Hebrew “Gabbatha.”
043	JOH	019	014	It was the Passover Preparation day, and about noon. Then he said to the crowd, ‘Here is your king!’
043	JOH	019	015	At that the people shouted, ‘Kill him! Kill him! Crucify him!’ ‘What! Should I crucify your king?’ exclaimed Pilate. ‘We have no king but the Emperor,’ replied the chief priests;
043	JOH	019	016	so Pilate gave Jesus up to them to be crucified. So they took Jesus;
043	JOH	019	017	and he went out, carrying his cross himself, to the place which is named from a skull, or, in Hebrew, Golgotha.
043	JOH	019	018	There they crucified him, and two others with him – one on each side, and Jesus between them.
043	JOH	019	019	Pilate also had these words written and put up over the cross – “JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.”
043	JOH	019	020	These words were read by many people, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and they were written in Hebrew, Latin and Greek.
043	JOH	019	021	The chief priests said to Pilate, ‘Do not write “The king of the Jews”, but write what the man said – “I am the king of the Jews.”’
043	JOH	019	022	But Pilate answered, ‘What I have written, I have written.’
043	JOH	019	023	When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his clothes and divided them into four shares – a share for each soldier – and they took the coat also. The coat had no seam, being woven in one piece from top to bottom.
043	JOH	019	024	So they said to one another, ‘Do not let us tear it, but let us cast lots for it, to see who will have it.’ This was in fulfilment of the words of scripture – “They shared my clothes among them, and over my clothing they cast lots.” That was what the soldiers did.
043	JOH	019	025	Meanwhile near the cross of Jesus were standing his mother and his mother’s sister, as well as Mary the wife of Clopas and Mary of Magdala.
043	JOH	019	026	When Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved, standing near, he said to his mother, ‘There is your son.’
043	JOH	019	027	Then he said to that disciple, ‘There is your mother.’ And from that very hour the disciple took her to live in his house.
043	JOH	019	028	Afterwards, knowing that everything was now finished, Jesus said, in fulfilment of the words of scripture, ‘I am thirsty.’
043	JOH	019	029	There was a bowl standing there full of common wine; so they put a sponge soaked in the wine on the end of a hyssop-stalk, and held it up to his mouth.
043	JOH	019	030	When Jesus had received the wine, he exclaimed, ‘All is finished!’ Then, bowing his head, he resigned his spirit to God.
043	JOH	019	031	It was the Preparation day, and so, to prevent the bodies from remaining on the crosses during the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a great day), the Jews asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies removed.
043	JOH	019	032	Accordingly the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man, and then those of the other who had been crucified with Jesus;
043	JOH	019	033	but, on coming to him, when they saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.
043	JOH	019	034	One of the soldiers, however, pierced his side with a spear, and blood and water immediately flowed from it.
043	JOH	019	035	This is the statement of one who actually saw it – and his statement may be relied on, and he knows that he is speaking the truth – and it is given in order that you also may be convinced.
043	JOH	019	036	For all this happened in fulfilment of the words of scripture – “Not one of its bones will be broken.”
043	JOH	019	037	And there is another passage which says – “They will look on him whom they pierced.”
043	JOH	019	038	After this, Joseph of Arimathea, a disciple of Jesus – but a secret one, owing to his fear of the religious authorities – begged Pilate’s permission to remove the body of Jesus. Pilate gave him leave; so Joseph went and removed the body.
043	JOH	019	039	Nicodemus, too – the man who had formerly visited Jesus by night – came with a roll of myrrh and aloes, weighing nearly a hundred pounds.
043	JOH	019	040	They took the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen with the spices, according to the Jewish mode of burial.
043	JOH	019	041	At the place where Jesus had been crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a newly made tomb in which no one had ever been laid.
043	JOH	019	042	And so, because of its being the Preparation day, and as the tomb was close at hand, they laid Jesus there.
043	JOH	020	001	On the first day of the week, early in the morning, while it was still dark, Mary of Magdala went to the tomb, and saw that the stone had been removed.
043	JOH	020	002	So she came running to Simon Peter, and to that other disciple who was Jesus’ friend, and said to them, ‘They have taken away the Master out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him!’
043	JOH	020	003	So, Peter started off with that other disciple, and they went to the tomb.
043	JOH	020	004	The two began running together; but the other disciple ran faster than Peter, and reached the tomb first.
043	JOH	020	005	Stooping down, he saw the linen wrappings lying there, but did not go in.
043	JOH	020	006	Presently Simon Peter came following behind him, and went into the tomb; and he looked at the linen wrappings lying there,
043	JOH	020	007	and the cloth which had been on Jesus’ head, not lying with the wrappings, but rolled up on one side, separately.
043	JOH	020	008	Then the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, went inside too, and he saw for himself and was convinced.
043	JOH	020	009	For they did not then understand the passage of scripture which says that Jesus must rise again from the dead.
043	JOH	020	010	The disciples then returned to their companions.
043	JOH	020	011	Meanwhile Mary was standing close outside the tomb, weeping. Still weeping, she leant forward into the tomb,
043	JOH	020	012	and perceived two angels clothed in white sitting there, where the body of Jesus had been lying, one where the head and the other where the feet had been.
043	JOH	020	013	‘Why are you weeping?’ asked the angels. ‘They have taken my Master away,’ she answered, ‘and I do not know where they have laid him.’
043	JOH	020	014	After saying this, she turned round, and looked at Jesus standing there, but she did not know that it was Jesus.
043	JOH	020	015	‘Why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking?’ he asked. Supposing him to be the gardener, Mary answered, ‘If it was you, Sir, who carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away myself.’
043	JOH	020	016	‘Mary!’ said Jesus. She turned round, and exclaimed in Hebrew, ‘Rabboni!’ (or, as we should say, “teacher”).
043	JOH	020	017	‘Do not hold me,’ Jesus said, ‘for I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go to my brothers, and tell them that I am ascending to him who is my Father and their Father, my God and their God.’
043	JOH	020	018	Mary of Magdala went and told the disciples that she had seen the Master, and that he had said this to her.
043	JOH	020	019	In the evening of the same day – the first day of the week – after the doors of the room, in which the disciples were, had been shut because they were afraid of the religious authorities, Jesus came and stood among them and said, ‘Peace be with you’;
043	JOH	020	020	after which he showed them his hands and his side. The disciples were filled with joy when they saw the Master.
043	JOH	020	021	Again Jesus said to them, ‘Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me as his messenger, so I am sending you.’
043	JOH	020	022	After saying this, he breathed on them, and said, ‘Receive the Holy Spirit;
043	JOH	020	023	if you remit anyone’s sins, they have been remitted; and, if you retain them, they have been retained.’
043	JOH	020	024	But Thomas, one of the Twelve, called “The Twin,” was not with them when Jesus came;
043	JOH	020	025	so the rest of the disciples said to him, ‘We have seen the Master!’ ‘Unless I see the marks of the nails in his hands,’ he exclaimed, ‘and put my finger into the marks, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe it.’
043	JOH	020	026	A week later the disciples were again in the house, and Thomas was with them. After the doors had been shut, Jesus came and stood among them, and said, ‘Peace be with you.’
043	JOH	020	027	Then he said to Thomas, ‘Place your finger here, and look at my hands; and place your hand here, and put it into my side; and do not refuse to believe, but believe.’
043	JOH	020	028	And Thomas exclaimed, ‘My Master, and my God!’
043	JOH	020	029	‘Is it because you have seen me that you have believed?’ said Jesus. ‘Blessed are they who have not seen, and yet have believed!’
043	JOH	020	030	There were many other signs of his mission that Jesus gave in presence of the disciples, which are not recorded in this book;
043	JOH	020	031	but these have been recorded so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God – and that, through your belief in his name, you may have life.
043	JOH	021	001	Later on, Jesus showed himself again to the disciples by the Sea of Tiberias.
043	JOH	021	002	It was in this way, – Simon Peter, Thomas, who was called “The Twin,” Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, Zebedee’s sons, and two other disciples of Jesus, were together, when Simon Peter said,
043	JOH	021	003	‘I am going fishing.’ ‘We will come with you,’ said the others. They went out and got into the boat, but caught nothing that night.
043	JOH	021	004	Just as day was breaking, Jesus came and stood on the beach; but the disciples did not know that it was he.
043	JOH	021	005	‘My children,’ he said, ‘have you anything to eat?’ ‘No,’ they answered.
043	JOH	021	006	‘Cast your net to the right of the boat,’ he said, ‘and you will find fish.’ So they cast the net, and now they could not haul it in because of the quantity of fish.
043	JOH	021	007	The disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, ‘It is the Master!’ When Simon Peter heard that it was the Master, he fastened his coat round him (for he had taken it off), and threw himself into the sea.
043	JOH	021	008	But the rest of the disciples came in the boat (for they were only about a hundred yards from shore), dragging the net full of fish.
043	JOH	021	009	When they had come ashore, they found a charcoal fire ready, with some fish already on it, and some bread as well.
043	JOH	021	010	‘Bring some of the fish which you have just caught,’ said Jesus.
043	JOH	021	011	So Simon Peter got into the boat and hauled the net ashore full of large fish, a hundred and fifty-three of them; and yet, although there were so many, the net had not been torn.
043	JOH	021	012	‘Come and have breakfast.’, Jesus said. None of the disciples dared ask him who he was, because they knew it was the Master.
043	JOH	021	013	Jesus went and took the bread and gave it to them, and the fish too.
043	JOH	021	014	This was the third time that Jesus showed himself to the disciples after he had risen from the dead.
043	JOH	021	015	When breakfast was over, Jesus said to Simon Peter, ‘Simon, son of John, do you love me more than the others?’ ‘Yes, Master,’ he answered, ‘you know that I am your friend.’ ‘Feed my lambs,’ said Jesus.
043	JOH	021	016	Then, a second time, Jesus asked, ‘Simon, son of John, do you love me?’ ‘Yes, Master,’ he answered, ‘you know that I am your friend.’ ‘Tend my sheep,’ said Jesus.
043	JOH	021	017	The third time, Jesus said to him, ‘Simon, son of John, are you my friend?’ Peter was hurt at his third question being “Are you my friend?”; and exclaimed, ‘Master, you know everything! You can tell that I am your friend.’ ‘Feed my sheep,’ said Jesus.
043	JOH	021	018	‘In truth I tell you,’ he continued, ‘when you were young, you used to put on your own clothes, and walk wherever you wished; but, when you have grown old, you will have to stretch out your hands, while someone else puts on your clothes, and takes you where you do not wish.’
043	JOH	021	019	Jesus said this to show the death by which Peter was to honour God, and then he added, ‘Follow me.’
043	JOH	021	020	Peter turned round, and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following – the one who at the supper leant back on the Master’s shoulder, and asked him who it was who would betray him.
043	JOH	021	021	Seeing him, Peter said to Jesus, ‘Master, what about this man?’
043	JOH	021	022	‘If it is my will that he should wait until I come,’ answered Jesus, ‘what has that to do with you? Follow me yourself.’
043	JOH	021	023	So the report spread among his followers that that disciple was not to die; yet Jesus did not say that he was not to die, but said ‘If it is my will that he should wait until I come, what has that to do with you?’
043	JOH	021	024	It is this disciple who states these things, and who recorded them; and we know that his statement is true.
043	JOH	021	025	There are many other things which Jesus did; but, if every one of them were to be recorded in detail, I suppose that even the world itself would not hold the books that would be written.

# BOOK	044	ACT	Acts	Acts
044	ACT	001	001	The first account which I drew up, Theophilus, dealt with all that Jesus did and taught from the very first,
044	ACT	001	002	down to that day on which he was taken up to heaven, after he had, by the help of the Holy Spirit, given instructions to the apostles whom he had chosen.
044	ACT	001	003	With abundant proofs, he showed himself to them, still living, after his death; appearing to them from time to time during forty days, and speaking of all that related to the kingdom of God.
044	ACT	001	004	And once, when he had gathered them together, he charged them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait there for the fulfilment of the Father’s promise – ‘that promise,’ he said, ‘of which you have heard me speak;
044	ACT	001	005	for, while John baptised with water, you will be baptised with the Holy Spirit before many days have passed.’
044	ACT	001	006	So, when the apostles had met together, they asked Jesus this question – ‘Master, is this the time when you intend to re-establish the kingdom for Israel?’
044	ACT	001	007	His answer was, ‘It is not for you to know times or hours, for the Father has reserved these for his own decision;
044	ACT	001	008	but you will receive power, when the Holy Spirit will have descended on you, and will be witnesses for me not only in Jerusalem, but throughout Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.’
044	ACT	001	009	No sooner had Jesus said this than he was caught up before their eyes, and a cloud received him from their sight.
044	ACT	001	010	While they were still gazing up into the heavens, as he went, suddenly two men, clothed in white, stood beside them,
044	ACT	001	011	and said, ‘People of Galilee, why are you standing here looking up into the heavens? This same Jesus, who has been taken from you into the heavens, will come in the same way in which you have seen him go into the heavens.’
044	ACT	001	012	Then the apostles returned to Jerusalem from the hill called Olivet, which is about three quarters of a mile from the city.
044	ACT	001	013	When they reached Jerusalem, they went to the upstairs room, where they were staying. There were there Peter, John, James, and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas the son of James.
044	ACT	001	014	They all united in devoting themselves to prayer, and so did some women, and Mary, the mother of Jesus, and his brothers.
044	ACT	001	015	About this time, at a meeting of the Lord’s followers, when there were about a hundred and twenty present, Peter rose to speak.
044	ACT	001	016	‘Friends,’ he said, ‘it was necessary that the prediction of scripture should be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit made by the lips of David about Judas, who acted as guide to the men who arrested Jesus,
044	ACT	001	017	for he was one of our number and had his part allotted him in this work of ours.’
044	ACT	001	018	(This man had bought a piece of land with the price of his treachery; and, falling heavily, his body had burst open, and all his bowels protruded.
044	ACT	001	019	This became known to everyone living in Jerusalem, so that the field came to be called, in their language, “Akeldama,” which means the “Field of Blood.”)
044	ACT	001	020	‘For in the book of Psalms,’ Peter continued, ‘it is said – “Let his home become desolate, and let no one live in it”; and also – “His office let another take.”
044	ACT	001	021	Therefore, from among the men who have been with us all the time that Jesus, our Master, went in and out among us –
044	ACT	001	022	from his baptism by John down to that day on which he was taken from us – someone must be found to join us as a witness of his resurrection.’
044	ACT	001	023	So they put forward two men, Joseph called Barsabbas, whose other name was Justus, and Matthias;
044	ACT	001	024	and they offered this prayer – ‘Lord, who reads all hearts, show which of these two men you have chosen
044	ACT	001	025	to take the place in this apostolic work, which Judas has abandoned, to go to his proper place.’
044	ACT	001	026	Then they drew lots between them; and, the lot having fallen to Matthias, he was added to the number of the eleven apostles.
044	ACT	002	001	In the course of the Festival at the close of the Harvest the disciples had all met together,
044	ACT	002	002	when suddenly there came from the heavens a noise like a strong wind rushing by; it filled the whole house in which they were sitting.
044	ACT	002	003	Then there appeared tongues of what seemed to be flame, separating, so that one settled on each of them;
044	ACT	002	004	and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak in different languages as the Spirit prompted their utterances.
044	ACT	002	005	Now there were then staying in Jerusalem religious Jews from every country in the world;
044	ACT	002	006	and, when this sound was heard, numbers of people collected, in the greatest excitement, because each of them heard the disciples speaking in his own language.
044	ACT	002	007	They were utterly amazed, and kept asking in astonishment, ‘What! Are not all these people who are speaking Galileans?
044	ACT	002	008	Then how is it that we each of us hear them in our own language?
044	ACT	002	009	Some of us are Parthians, some Medes, some Elamites; and some of us live in Mesopotamia, in Judea and Cappadocia, in Pontus and Roman Asia,
044	ACT	002	010	in Phrygia and Pamphylia, in Egypt and the districts of Libya adjoining Cyrene; some of us are visitors from Rome,
044	ACT	002	011	either Jews by birth or converts, and some are Cretans and Arabians – yet we all alike hear them speaking in our own languages of the great things that God has done.’
044	ACT	002	012	They were all utterly amazed and bewildered. ‘What does it mean?’ they asked one another.
044	ACT	002	013	But there were some who said with a sneer, ‘They have had too much new wine.’
044	ACT	002	014	Then Peter, surrounded by the eleven other apostles, stood up, and, raising his voice, addressed the crowd. ‘People of Judea,’ he began, ‘and all you who are staying in Jerusalem, let me tell you what this means. Mark well my words.
044	ACT	002	015	These people are not drunk, as you suppose; for it is only now nine in the morning! No!
044	ACT	002	016	This is what is spoken of in the prophet Joel –
044	ACT	002	017	“It will come about in the last days,” God says, “That I will pour out my Spirit on all humanity; your sons and your daughters will become prophets, your young men will see visions, and your old men dream dreams;
044	ACT	002	018	yes, even on the slaves – for they are mine – both men and women, I will in those days pour out my Spirit, and they will become prophets;
044	ACT	002	019	and I will show wonders in the heavens above, and signs on the earth below – blood and fire and mist of smoke;
044	ACT	002	020	the sun will become darkness, and the moon blood-red, before the day of the Lord comes – that great and awful day.
044	ACT	002	021	Then will everyone who invokes the name of the Lord be saved.”
044	ACT	002	022	People of Israel, listen to what I am saying. Jesus of Nazareth, a man whose mission from God to you was proved by miracles, wonders, and signs, which God showed among you through him, as you know full well –
044	ACT	002	023	he, I say, in accordance with God’s definite plan and with his previous knowledge, was betrayed, and you, by the hands of lawless men, nailed him to a cross and put him to death.
044	ACT	002	024	But God released him from the pangs of death and raised him to life, it being impossible for death to retain its hold on him.
044	ACT	002	025	Indeed he was the one David was referring to when he said – “I have had the Lord ever before my eyes, for he stands at my right hand, so that I should not be disquieted.
044	ACT	002	026	Therefore my heart was cheered, and my tongue told its delight; yes, even my body, too, will rest in hope;
044	ACT	002	027	For you will not abandon my soul to Hades, nor surrender me, your holy one, to undergo corruption.
044	ACT	002	028	You have shown me the path to life, you will fill me with gladness in your presence.”
044	ACT	002	029	Friends, I can speak to you the more confidently about the patriarch David, because he is dead and buried, and his tomb is here among us to this very day.
044	ACT	002	030	David, then, prophet as he was, knowing that God had solemnly sworn to him to set one of his descendants on his throne, looked into the future,
044	ACT	002	031	and referred to the resurrection of the Christ when he said that he had not been abandoned to Hades, nor had his body undergone corruption.
044	ACT	002	032	It was this Jesus, whom God raised to life; and of that we are ourselves all witnesses.
044	ACT	002	033	And now that he has been exalted to the right hand of God, and has received from the Father the promised gift of the Holy Spirit, he has begun to pour out that gift, as you yourselves now see and hear.
044	ACT	002	034	It was not David who went up into heaven; for he himself says – “The Lord said to my master, ‘Sit on my right hand,
044	ACT	002	035	Until I put your enemies as a footstool under your feet.’”
044	ACT	002	036	So let the whole nation of Israel know beyond all doubt, that God has made him both Lord and Christ – this Jesus whom you crucified.’
044	ACT	002	037	When the people heard this, they were conscience-smitten, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, ‘Friends, what can we do?’
044	ACT	002	038	‘Repent,’ answered Peter, ‘and be baptised every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and then you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
044	ACT	002	039	For the promise is for you and for your children, and also for all those now far away, who may be called by the Lord our God.’
044	ACT	002	040	Peter spoke to them for a long time using many other arguments and pleaded with them – ‘Save yourselves from the perverse spirit of this age.’
044	ACT	002	041	So those who accepted his teaching were baptised, and about three thousand people joined the disciples on that day alone.
044	ACT	002	042	They devoted themselves to the teaching of the apostles and to the Common life of the church, to the breaking of the bread and to the Prayers.
044	ACT	002	043	A deep impression was made on everyone, and many wonders and signs were done at the hands of the apostles.
044	ACT	002	044	All who became believers in Christ held everything for the common use;
044	ACT	002	045	they sold their property and their goods, and shared the proceeds among them all, according to their individual needs.
044	ACT	002	046	Every day they devoted themselves to meeting together in the Temple Courts, and to the breaking of bread at their homes, while they partook of their food in simple-hearted gladness, praising God, and winning the goodwill of all the people.
044	ACT	002	047	And the Lord daily added to their company those who were in the path of salvation.
044	ACT	003	001	One day, as Peter and John were going up into the Temple Courts for the three o’clock Prayers,
044	ACT	003	002	a man, who had been lame from his birth, was being carried by. This man used to be set down every day at the gate of the Temple called “the Beautiful Gate,” to beg of those who went in.
044	ACT	003	003	Seeing Peter and John on the point of entering, he asked them to give him something.
044	ACT	003	004	Peter fixed his eyes on him, and so did John, and then Peter said, ‘Look at us.’
044	ACT	003	005	The man was all attention, expecting to get something from them;
044	ACT	003	006	but Peter added, ‘I have no gold or silver, but I give you what I have. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, get up and walk.’
044	ACT	003	007	Grasping the lame man by the right hand, Peter lifted him up. Instantly the man’s feet and ankles became strong,
044	ACT	003	008	and, leaping up, he stood and began to walk about, and then went with them into the Temple Courts, walking, and leaping, and praising God.
044	ACT	003	009	All the people saw him walking about and praising God;
044	ACT	003	010	and, when they recognised him as the man who used to sit begging at the Beautiful Gate of the Temple, they were utterly astonished and amazed at what had happened to him.
044	ACT	003	011	While the man still clung to Peter and John, the people all quickly gathered round them in the Colonnade named after Solomon, in the greatest astonishment.
044	ACT	003	012	On seeing this, Peter said to the people, ‘People of Israel, why are you surprised at this? And why do you stare at us, as though we, by any power or piety of our own, had enabled this man to walk?
044	ACT	003	013	The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our ancestors, has done honour to his servant Jesus – him whom you gave up and disowned before Pilate, when he had decided to set him free.
044	ACT	003	014	You, I say, disowned the holy and righteous one, and asked for the release of a murderer!
044	ACT	003	015	The guide to life you put to death! But God raised him from the dead – and of that we are ourselves witnesses.
044	ACT	003	016	And it is by faith in the name of Jesus, that this man, whom you all see and know, has – by his name – been made strong. Yes, it is the faith inspired by Jesus that has made this complete cure of the man, before the eyes of you all.
044	ACT	003	017	And yet, my friends, I know that you acted as you did from ignorance, and your rulers also.
044	ACT	003	018	But it was in this way that God fulfilled all that he had long ago foretold, as to the sufferings of his Christ, by the lips of all the prophets.
044	ACT	003	019	Therefore, repent and turn so that your sins may be wiped away; so that happier times may come from the Lord himself,
044	ACT	003	020	and so that he may send you, in Jesus, your long-appointed Christ.
044	ACT	003	021	But heaven must be his home, until the days of the Universal Restoration, of which God has spoken by the lips of his holy prophets from the very first.
044	ACT	003	022	Moses himself said – “The Lord your God will raise up from among yourselves a prophet, as he raised me. To him you will listen whenever he speaks to you.
044	ACT	003	023	And it will be that should anyone among the people not listen to that prophet, he will be utterly destroyed.”
044	ACT	003	024	Yes, and all the prophets from Samuel onwards, and all their successors who had a message to deliver, told of these days.
044	ACT	003	025	You yourselves are the heirs of the prophets, and heirs, too, of the covenant which God made with your ancestors, when he said to Abraham – “In your descendants will all the nations of the earth be blessed.”
044	ACT	003	026	For you, first, God raised up his servant, and sent him to bless you, by turning each one of you from his wicked ways.’
044	ACT	004	001	While Peter and John were still speaking to the people, the chief priest, with the officer in charge at the Temple and the Sadducees, came up to them,
044	ACT	004	002	much annoyed because they were teaching the people, and because, through Jesus, they were preaching the resurrection from the dead.
044	ACT	004	003	They arrested the apostles and, as it was already evening, had them placed in custody until the next day.
044	ACT	004	004	Many, however, of those who had heard the apostles’ message became believers in Christ, the number of the men alone amounting to about five thousand.
044	ACT	004	005	The next day, a meeting of the leaders of the people, the elders, and the teachers of the Law was held in Jerusalem.
044	ACT	004	006	There were present Annas the high priest, Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and all who were of High-Priestly rank.
044	ACT	004	007	They had Peter and John brought before them, and questioned them. ‘By what power,’ they asked, ‘Or in whose name have men like you done this thing?’
044	ACT	004	008	Then, Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said, ‘Leaders of the people and elders,
044	ACT	004	009	since we are on our trial today for a kind act done to a helpless man, and are asked in what way the man here before you has been cured,
044	ACT	004	010	let me tell you all and all the people of Israel, that it is by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified and whom God raised from the dead – it is, I say, by his name that this man stands here before you lame no longer.
044	ACT	004	011	Jesus is “the stone which, scorned by you the builders, has yet become the corner stone.”
044	ACT	004	012	And salvation is in him alone; for there is no other name in the whole world, given to people, to which we must look for our salvation.’
044	ACT	004	013	When the Council saw how boldly Peter and John spoke, and found that they were uneducated men of humble station, they were surprised, and realised that they had been companions of Jesus.
044	ACT	004	014	But, when they looked at the man who had been healed, standing there with them, they had nothing to say.
044	ACT	004	015	So they ordered them out of court, and then began consulting together.
044	ACT	004	016	‘What are we to do to these men?’ they asked one another. ‘That a remarkable sign has been given through them is obvious to everyone living in Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it.
044	ACT	004	017	But, to prevent this thing from spreading further among the people, let us warn them not to speak in this name any more to anyone whatever.’
044	ACT	004	018	So they called the apostles in, and ordered them not to speak or teach in the name of Jesus.
044	ACT	004	019	But Peter and John replied, ‘Whether it is right, in the sight of God, to listen to you rather than to him – judge for yourselves,
044	ACT	004	020	for we cannot help speaking of what we have seen and heard.’
044	ACT	004	021	However, after further warnings, the Council set them at liberty, not seeing any safe way of punishing them, because of the people, for they were all praising God for what had occurred;
044	ACT	004	022	for the man who was the subject of this miraculous cure was more than forty years old.
044	ACT	004	023	After they had been set at liberty, the apostles went to their friends and told them what the chief priests and the elders had said to them.
044	ACT	004	024	All who heard their story, moved by a common impulse, raised their voices to God in prayer: ‘Sovereign Lord, it is you who has made the heavens, the earth, the sea, and everything that is in them,
044	ACT	004	025	and who, by the lips of our ancestor, your servant David, who spoke under the influence of the Holy Spirit, have said – “Why did the nations rage, and the peoples form vain designs?
044	ACT	004	026	The kings of the earth set their array, and its rulers gathered together, against the Lord and against his Christ.”
044	ACT	004	027	There have indeed gathered together in this city against your holy servant Jesus, whom you has consecrated the Christ, not Herod and Pontius Pilate only, but the nations and the people of Israel besides –
044	ACT	004	028	yet only to do what you, by your power and of your own will, did long ago destine to be done.
044	ACT	004	029	Now, therefore, Lord, mark their threats, and enable your servants, with all fearlessness, to tell your message,
044	ACT	004	030	while you stretch out your hand to heal, and cause signs and wonders to take place through the name of your holy servant Jesus.’
044	ACT	004	031	When their prayer was ended, the place in which they were assembled was shaken; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to tell God’s message fearlessly.
044	ACT	004	032	The whole body of those who had become believers in Christ were of one heart and mind. Not one of them claimed any of his goods as his own, but everything was held for the common use.
044	ACT	004	033	The apostles continued with great power to bear their testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and God’s blessing rested on them all abundantly.
044	ACT	004	034	Nor was there anyone in need among them, for all who were owners of land or houses sold them, and brought the proceeds of the sales
044	ACT	004	035	and laid them at the apostles’ feet; and then everyone received a share in proportion to his wants.
044	ACT	004	036	A Levite of Cyprian birth, named Joseph, (who had received from the apostles the additional name of “Barnabas” – which means “The Consoler,”)
044	ACT	004	037	Sold a farm that belonged to him, and brought the money and laid it at the apostles’ feet.
044	ACT	005	001	There was, however, a man named Ananias, who, with his wife Sapphira, sold some property,
044	ACT	005	002	and, with her connivance, kept back some of the proceeds. He brought only a part and laid it at the apostles’ feet.
044	ACT	005	003	‘Ananias,’ Peter exclaimed, ‘how is it that Satan has so taken possession of your heart that you have lied to the Holy Spirit, and kept back a part of the money paid for the land?
044	ACT	005	004	While it was unsold, was not it your own? And after it was sold, was not the money at your own disposal? How did you come to think of such a thing? You have lied, not to people, but to God!’
044	ACT	005	005	As Ananias heard these words, he fell down and expired; and everyone who heard of it was appalled.
044	ACT	005	006	The young men got up, and, winding the body in a sheet, carried it out and buried it.
044	ACT	005	007	After an interval of about three hours his wife came in, not knowing what had happened.
044	ACT	005	008	‘Is it true,’ Peter asked, addressing her, ‘that you sold your land for such a sum?’ ‘Yes,’ she answered, ‘we did.’
044	ACT	005	009	Then Peter said, ‘How did you come to agree to provoke the Spirit of the Lord? Listen! The footsteps of those who have buried your husband are at the door; and they will carry you out too.’
044	ACT	005	010	Instantly Sapphira fell down at Peter’s feet and expired. On coming in, the young men found her dead; so they carried her out and buried her by her husband’s side.
044	ACT	005	011	The whole church and all who heard of these events were appalled.
044	ACT	005	012	Many signs and wonders continued to occur among the people, through the instrumentality of the apostles, whose custom it was to meet all together in the Colonnade of Solomon;
044	ACT	005	013	but of the rest no one ventured to join them. On the other hand, the people were full of their praise,
044	ACT	005	014	and still larger numbers, both of men and women, as they became believers in the Lord, were added to their number.
044	ACT	005	015	The consequence was that people would bring out their sick even into the streets, and lay them on mattresses and mats, in the hope that, as Peter came by, at least his shadow might fall on someone of them.
044	ACT	005	016	Besides this, the inhabitants of the towns round Jerusalem flocked into the city, bringing with them their sick and those who were troubled by foul spirits; and they were cured everyone.
044	ACT	005	017	At this the high priest was roused to action, and he and all his supporters (who formed the party of the Sadducees), moved by jealousy,
044	ACT	005	018	arrested the apostles, and had them placed in custody.
044	ACT	005	019	An angel of the Lord, however, opened the prison doors at night and led them out.
044	ACT	005	020	‘Go,’ he said, ‘and stand in the Temple Courts, and tell the people the whole message of this new life.’
044	ACT	005	021	When they heard this, they went at daybreak into the Temple Courts, and began to teach. The high priest and his party, on their arrival, summoned the High Council, including all the leaders of the people among the Israelites, and sent to the jail to fetch the apostles.
044	ACT	005	022	But, when the officers got there, they did not find them in the prison; so they returned and reported that,
044	ACT	005	023	while they had found the jail barred securely and the guards posted at the doors, yet, on opening them, they had not found anyone inside.
044	ACT	005	024	When the officer in charge at the Temple and the chief priests heard their story, they were perplexed about the apostles and as to what all this would lead to.
044	ACT	005	025	Presently, however, someone came and told them, that the men whom they had put in prison were actually standing in the Temple Courts, teaching the people.
044	ACT	005	026	Then, the officer went with his men and fetched the apostles – without using violence, for they were afraid of being stoned by the people –
044	ACT	005	027	and then brought them before the Council. The high priest demanded an explanation from them.
044	ACT	005	028	‘We gave you strict orders,’ he said, ‘not to teach in this name. Yet you have actually flooded Jerusalem with your teaching, and you want to make us responsible for the death of this man.’
044	ACT	005	029	To this Peter and the apostles replied, ‘We must obey God rather than people.
044	ACT	005	030	The God of our ancestors raised Jesus, whom you put to death by hanging him on a cross.
044	ACT	005	031	It is this Jesus whom God has exalted to his right hand, to be a guide and a Saviour, to give Israel repentance and forgiveness of sins.
044	ACT	005	032	And we are witness to the truth of this, and so is the Holy Spirit – the gift of God to those who obey him.’
044	ACT	005	033	The members of the Council became frantic with rage on hearing this, and were for putting the apostles to death.
044	ACT	005	034	But Gamaliel, a Pharisee, who was a Doctor of the Law and who was held in universal respect, rose in the Council, and directed that the men should be taken out of court for a little while.
044	ACT	005	035	He then said, ‘People of Israel, take care as to what you intend to do with these men.
044	ACT	005	036	For not long ago Theudas appeared, professing to be somebody, and was joined by a body of some four hundred men. But he was killed; and all his followers scattered and dwindled away.
044	ACT	005	037	After him, Judas the Galilean appeared at the time of the census, and induced people to follow him; yet he, too, perished and all his followers were dispersed.
044	ACT	005	038	And, in this present case, my advice to you is not to interfere with these men, but to leave them alone, for, if their designs and their work are merely of human origin, they will come to an end;
044	ACT	005	039	but, if they are of divine origin, you will be powerless to put an end to them – or else you may find yourselves fighting against God!’
044	ACT	005	040	The Council followed his advice, and, calling the apostles in, had them flogged, and then, after cautioning them not to speak in the name of Jesus, set them free.
044	ACT	005	041	But the apostles left the Council, rejoicing that they had been thought worthy to suffer disgrace for that name;
044	ACT	005	042	and never for a single day, either in the Temple Courts or in private houses, did they cease to teach, or to tell the good news of Jesus, the Christ.
044	ACT	006	001	About this time, when the number of the disciples was constantly increasing, complaints were made by the Greek speaking Jews against the Aramaic speaking Jews, that their widows were being overlooked in the daily distribution.
044	ACT	006	002	The Twelve, therefore, called together the general body of the disciples and said to them, ‘It is not well for us to see to the distribution at the tables and neglect God’s message.
044	ACT	006	003	Therefore, friends, look for seven men of reputation among yourselves, wise and spiritually-minded men, and we will appoint them to attend to this matter;
044	ACT	006	004	while we, for our part, will devote ourselves to prayer, and to the delivery of the message.’
044	ACT	006	005	This proposal was unanimously agreed to; and the disciples chose Stephen – a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit – and Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicholas of Antioch, a former convert to Judaism;
044	ACT	006	006	and they brought these men to the apostles, who, after praying, placed their hands on them.
044	ACT	006	007	So God’s message spread, and the number of the disciples continued to increase rapidly in Jerusalem, and a large body of the priests accepted the faith.
044	ACT	006	008	Meanwhile Stephen, divinely helped and strengthened, was showing great wonders and signs among the people.
044	ACT	006	009	But some members of the Synagogue of the Freed Slaves (as it was called), Cyrenians, Alexandrians, and Visitors from Cilicia and Roman Asia, were roused to action and began disputing with Stephen;
044	ACT	006	010	yet they were quite unable to withstand the wisdom and the inspiration with which he spoke.
044	ACT	006	011	Then they induced some men to assert that they had heard Stephen saying blasphemous things against Moses, and against God;
044	ACT	006	012	and they stirred up the people, as well as the elders and the teachers of the Law, and set on Stephen, and arrested him, and brought him before the High Council.
044	ACT	006	013	There they produced witnesses who gave false evidence. ‘This man,’ they said, ‘is incessantly saying things against this holy place and the Law;
044	ACT	006	014	indeed, we have heard him declare that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place, and change the customs handed down to us by Moses.’
044	ACT	006	015	The eyes of all the members of the Council were riveted on Stephen, and they saw his face looking like the face of an angel.
044	ACT	007	001	Then the high priest asked, ‘Is this true?’
044	ACT	007	002	Stephen replied, ‘Brothers and fathers, hear what I have to say. God, who manifests himself in the glory, appeared to our ancestor Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, and before he settled in Haran, and said to him –
044	ACT	007	003	“Leave your country and your people, and come into the country that I will show you.”
044	ACT	007	004	And so Abraham left the country of the Chaldaeans and settled in Haran; and from there, after his father’s death, God caused him to migrate into this country, in which you are now living.
044	ACT	007	005	God did not at that time give him any part of it, not even a foot of ground. But he promised to give him possession of it and his descendants after him, though at that time he had no child.
044	ACT	007	006	God’s words were these – “Abraham’s descendants will live in a foreign country, where they will be enslaved and ill-treated for four hundred years.
044	ACT	007	007	But I myself will judge the nation, to which they will be enslaved,” God said, “and after that they will leave the country and worship me in this place.”
044	ACT	007	008	Then God made with Abraham the covenant of circumcision; and under it Abraham became the father of Isaac, and circumcised him when he was eight days old; and Isaac became the father of Jacob; and Jacob of the Twelve Patriarchs.
044	ACT	007	009	The Patriarchs, out of jealousy, sold Joseph into slavery in Egypt; but God was with him,
044	ACT	007	010	and delivered him out of all his troubles, and enabled him to win favour and show wisdom before Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who appointed him Governor of Egypt and of his whole household.
044	ACT	007	011	Then a famine spread over the whole of Egypt and Canaan, causing great distress, and our ancestors could find no food.
044	ACT	007	012	Hearing, however, that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob sent our ancestors there on their first visit.
044	ACT	007	013	In the course of their second visit, Joseph revealed himself to his brothers, and his family became known to Pharaoh.
044	ACT	007	014	Then Joseph sent an urgent invitation to his father Jacob and to his relatives, seventy-five persons in all;
044	ACT	007	015	and so Jacob went down into Egypt. There he died, and our ancestors also,
044	ACT	007	016	and their bodies were removed to Shechem, and laid in the tomb which Abraham had bought for a sum of money from the sons of Hamor in Shechem.
044	ACT	007	017	As the time drew near for the fulfilment of the promise which God had made to Abraham, the people increased largely in numbers in Egypt,
044	ACT	007	018	until a new king, who knew nothing of Joseph, came to the throne.
044	ACT	007	019	This king acted deceitfully towards our people and ill-treated our ancestors, making them abandon their own infants, so that they should not be reared.
044	ACT	007	020	It was just at this time that Moses was born. He was an exceedingly beautiful child, and for three months was brought up in his own father’s house;
044	ACT	007	021	and, when he was abandoned, the daughter of Pharaoh found him and brought him up as her own son.
044	ACT	007	022	So Moses was educated in all the learning of the Egyptians, and proved his ability both by his words and actions.
044	ACT	007	023	When he was in his fortieth year, he resolved to visit his fellow Israelites;
044	ACT	007	024	and, seeing an Israelite ill-treated, he defended him, and avenged the man, who was being wronged, by striking down the Egyptian.
044	ACT	007	025	He thought his own people would understand that God was using him to save them; but they failed to do so.
044	ACT	007	026	The next day he again appeared on the scene, when some of them were fighting, and tried to make peace between them. “Men,” he said, “you are brothers; how is it that you are ill-treating one another?”
044	ACT	007	027	But the man who was ill-treating his fellow workman pushed Moses aside saying – “Who made you a ruler and judge over us?
044	ACT	007	028	Do you mean to make away with me as you did yesterday with that Egyptian?”
044	ACT	007	029	At these words Moses took to flight, and became an exile in Midian; and there he had two sons born to him.
044	ACT	007	030	Forty years had passed when there appeared to him, in the desert of Mount Sinai, an angel in a flame of fire in a bush.
044	ACT	007	031	When Moses saw it, he was astonished at the vision; but on his going nearer to look at it more closely, the voice of the Lord was heard to say –
044	ACT	007	032	“I am the God of your ancestors, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.” Moses trembled, and did not dare to look.
044	ACT	007	033	Then the Lord said to him – “Take your sandals off your feet, for the spot where you are standing is holy ground.
044	ACT	007	034	I have seen the oppression of my people who are in Egypt, and heard their groans, and I have come down to deliver them. Come now and I will send you into Egypt.”
044	ACT	007	035	This same Moses, whom they had disowned with the words – “Who made you a ruler and a judge?” was the man whom God sent to be both a ruler and a deliverer, under the guidance of the angel that had appeared to him in the bush.
044	ACT	007	036	He it was who led them out, after he had shown wonders and signs in Egypt, in the Red Sea, and in the desert during forty years.
044	ACT	007	037	This was the Moses who said to the people of Israel – “God will raise up for you, from among yourselves, a prophet, as he raised up me.”
044	ACT	007	038	He, too, it was who was present at the assembly in the desert, with the angel who talked to him on Mount Sinai, and with our ancestors, and who received living truths to impart to you.
044	ACT	007	039	Yet our ancestors refused him obedience; more than that, they rejected him, and in their hearts turned back to Egypt,
044	ACT	007	040	while they said to Aaron – “Make us Gods who will lead the way for us, since, as for this Moses who has brought us out of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.”
044	ACT	007	041	That was the time when they made the calf and offered sacrifice to their idol, and held festivities in honour of their own handiwork!
044	ACT	007	042	So God turned from them and left them to the worship of the Starry Host, as is written in the book of the prophets – “Did you offer victims and sacrifices to me, house of Israel, all those forty years in the desert?
044	ACT	007	043	You took with you the tent where Moloch is worshipped and the star of the god Rephan – the images which you had made to worship. Therefore I will exile you beyond Babylon.”
044	ACT	007	044	Our ancestors had the tent where they worshipped God in the desert, constructed, just as he who spoke to Moses had directed him to make it, after the model which he had seen.
044	ACT	007	045	This tent, which was handed down to them, was brought into this country by our ancestors who accompanied Joshua (at the conquest of the nations that God drove out before their advance), and remained here until the time of David.
044	ACT	007	046	David found favour with God, and prayed that he might provide the God of Jacob with a place to reside.
044	ACT	007	047	But it was Solomon who built a house for God.
044	ACT	007	048	Yet it is not in buildings made by hands that the Most High dwells. As the prophet says –
044	ACT	007	049	“The heavens are a throne for me, and the earth a stool for my feet. What manner of house will you build me, asks the Lord, or what place is there where I may rest?
044	ACT	007	050	Was it not my hand that made all these things?”
044	ACT	007	051	Stubborn people, heathen in heart and ears, you are for ever resisting the Holy Spirit; your ancestors did it, and you are doing it still.
044	ACT	007	052	Which of the prophets escaped persecution at their hands? They killed those who foretold the coming of the righteous one; of whom you, in your turn, have now become the betrayers and murderers –
044	ACT	007	053	you who received the Law as transmitted by angels and yet failed to keep it.’
044	ACT	007	054	As they listened to this, the Council grew frantic with rage, and gnashed their teeth at Stephen.
044	ACT	007	055	He, filled as he was with the Holy Spirit, fixed his eyes intently on the heavens, and saw the glory of God and Jesus standing at God’s right hand.
044	ACT	007	056	‘Look,’ he exclaimed, ‘I see heaven open and the Son of Man standing at God’s right hand!’
044	ACT	007	057	At this, with a loud shout, they stopped their ears and all rushed on him, forced him outside the city,
044	ACT	007	058	and began to stone him, the witnesses laying their clothes at the feet of a young man named Saul.
044	ACT	007	059	And they stoned Stephen, while he cried to the Lord, ‘Lord Jesus! Receive my spirit!’
044	ACT	007	060	Falling on his knees, he called out loudly, ‘Lord! Do not charge them with this sin;’ and with these words he fell asleep.
044	ACT	008	001	Saul approved of his being put to death. On that very day a great persecution broke out against the church which was in Jerusalem; and its members, with the exception of the apostles, were all scattered over the districts of Judea and Samaria.
044	ACT	008	002	Some religious men buried Stephen, with loud lamentations for him.
044	ACT	008	003	But Saul began to devastate the church; he entered house after house, dragged out men and women alike, and threw them into prison.
044	ACT	008	004	Now those who were scattered in different directions went from place to place proclaiming the good news.
044	ACT	008	005	Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and there began to preach the Christ.
044	ACT	008	006	The people, one and all, listened attentively to what Philip told them, when they heard of, and saw, the miracles which he was working.
044	ACT	008	007	For there were many instances of people with foul spirits, where the spirits, with loud screams, came out of them; and many who were paralysed or lame were cured,
044	ACT	008	008	so that there was great rejoicing throughout that city.
044	ACT	008	009	There was staying in the city a man named Simon, who had been practicing magic there and mystifying the Samaritan people, giving himself out to be some great being.
044	ACT	008	010	Everyone, high and low, paid attention to him. “This man,” they used to say, “must be that power of God which people call ‘The Great Power.’”
044	ACT	008	011	And they paid attention to him because they had for a long time been mystified by his magic arts.
044	ACT	008	012	However, when they came to believe Philip, as he told them the good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptised, both men and women.
044	ACT	008	013	Even Simon believed, and after his baptism attached himself to Philip, and was in his turn mystified at seeing signs and great miracles constantly occurring.
044	ACT	008	014	When the apostles at Jerusalem heard that the Samaritans had welcomed God’s message, they sent Peter and John to them;
044	ACT	008	015	and they, on their arrival, prayed that the Samaritans might receive the Holy Spirit.
044	ACT	008	016	(As yet the Spirit had not descended on any of them; they had only been baptised in the name of the Lord Jesus).
044	ACT	008	017	Then Peter and John placed their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.
044	ACT	008	018	When Simon saw that it was through the placing of the apostles’ hands on them that the Spirit was given, he brought them a sum of money and said,
044	ACT	008	019	‘Give me also this power of yours, so that, if I place my hands on anyone, he may receive the Holy Spirit.’
044	ACT	008	020	‘A curse on you and on your silver,’ Peter exclaimed, ‘for thinking that God’s free gift can be bought with money!
044	ACT	008	021	You have no share or part in our message, for your heart is not right with God.
044	ACT	008	022	Therefore repent of this wickedness of yours, and pray to the Lord, that, if possible, you may be forgiven for such a thought;
044	ACT	008	023	for I see that you have fallen into the bitterness of envy and the fetters of sin.’
044	ACT	008	024	‘Pray to the Lord for me, all of you,’ Simon answered, ‘so that none of the things you have spoken of may happen to me.’
044	ACT	008	025	Peter and John, having borne their testimony and delivered the Lord’s message, returned to Jerusalem, telling the good news, as they went, in many Samaritan villages.
044	ACT	008	026	Meanwhile an angel of the Lord had said to Philip, ‘Set out on a journey southwards, along the road that runs down from Jerusalem to Gaza.’ (It is now deserted).
044	ACT	008	027	So Philip set out on a journey; and on his way he came on an official of high rank, in the service of Candace, Queen of the Abyssinians. He was her treasurer, and had been to Jerusalem to worship,
044	ACT	008	028	and was now on his way home, sitting in his carriage and reading the prophet Isaiah.
044	ACT	008	029	The Spirit said to Philip, ‘Go up to the carriage over there and keep close to it.’
044	ACT	008	030	So Philip ran up, and he heard the Abyssinian reading the prophet Isaiah. ‘Do you understand what you are reading?’ he asked.
044	ACT	008	031	‘How can I,’ the other answered, ‘unless someone will explain it to me?’ and he invited Philip to get up and sit by his side.
044	ACT	008	032	The passage of scripture which he was reading was this – “Like a sheep, he was led away to slaughter, and as a lamb is dumb in the hands of its shearer, so he refrains from opening his lips.
044	ACT	008	033	He was humiliated and justice was denied him. Who will tell the story of his generation? For his life is cut off from earth.”
044	ACT	008	034	‘Now,’ said the Treasurer, addressing Philip, ‘tell me, of whom is the prophet speaking? Of himself, or of someone else?’
044	ACT	008	035	Then Philip began, and, taking this passage as his text, told him the good news about Jesus.
044	ACT	008	036	Presently, as they were going along the road, they came to some water, and the Treasurer exclaimed, ‘Look! Here is water; what is to prevent my being baptised?’
044	ACT	008	038	So he ordered the carriage to stop, and they went down into the water – both Philip and the Treasurer – and Philip baptised him.
044	ACT	008	039	But, when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught Philip away, and the Treasurer saw no more of him; for he continued his journey with a joyful heart.
044	ACT	008	040	But Philip was found at Ashdod, and, as he went on his way, he told the good news in all the towns through which he passed, until he came to Caesarea.
044	ACT	009	001	Meanwhile Saul, still breathing murderous threats against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest,
044	ACT	009	002	and asked him to give him letters to the Jewish congregations at Damascus, authorising him, if he found there any supporters of the Way, whether men or women, to have them put in chains and brought to Jerusalem.
044	ACT	009	003	While on his journey, as he was nearing Damascus, suddenly a light from the heavens flashed around him.
044	ACT	009	004	He fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him – ‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?’
044	ACT	009	005	‘Who are you, Lord?’ he asked. ‘I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting,’ the voice answered;
044	ACT	009	006	‘Yet stand up and go into the city, and you will be told what you must do.’
044	ACT	009	007	The men traveling with Saul were meanwhile standing speechless; they heard the sound of the voice, but saw no one.
044	ACT	009	008	When Saul got up from the ground, though his eyes were open, he could see nothing. So his men led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus;
044	ACT	009	009	and for three days he was unable to see, and took nothing either to eat or to drink.
044	ACT	009	010	Now there was at Damascus a disciple named Ananias, to whom, in a vision, the Lord said, ‘Ananias.’ ‘Yes, Lord,’ he answered.
044	ACT	009	011	‘Go at once,’ said the Lord, ‘to the Straight Street, and ask at Judas’s house for a man named Saul, from Tarsus. He is at this moment praying,
044	ACT	009	012	and he has seen, in a vision, a man named Ananias coming in and placing his hands on him, so that he may recover his sight.’
044	ACT	009	013	‘Lord,’ exclaimed Ananias, ‘I have heard from many people about this man – how much harm he has done at Jerusalem to your people there.
044	ACT	009	014	And, here, too, he holds authority from the chief priests to put in chains all those who invoke your name.’
044	ACT	009	015	But the Lord said to him, ‘Go, for this man is my chosen instrument to uphold my name before the Gentiles and their kings, and the people of Israel.
044	ACT	009	016	I will myself show him all that he has to suffer for my name.’
044	ACT	009	017	So Ananias went, entered the house, and, placing his hands on Saul, said, ‘Saul, my brother, I have been sent by the Lord – by Jesus, who appeared to you on your way here – so that you may recover your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.’
044	ACT	009	018	Instantly it seemed as if a film fell from Saul’s eyes, and his sight was restored. Then he got up and was baptised,
044	ACT	009	019	and, after he had taken food, he felt his strength return. Saul stayed for some days with the disciples who were at Damascus,
044	ACT	009	020	and at once began in the synagogues to proclaim Jesus as the Son of God.
044	ACT	009	021	All who heard him were amazed. ‘Is not this,’ they asked, ‘the man who worked havoc in Jerusalem among those that invoke this name, and who had also come here for the express purpose of having such persons put in chains and taken before the chief priests?’
044	ACT	009	022	Saul’s influence, however, kept steadily increasing, and he confounded the Jewish people who lived in Damascus by the proofs that he gave that Jesus was the Christ.
044	ACT	009	023	After some time some of them laid a plot to kill Saul,
044	ACT	009	024	but it became known to him. They even watched the gates day and night, to kill him;
044	ACT	009	025	but his disciples let him down by night through an opening in the wall, lowering him in a basket.
044	ACT	009	026	On his arrival in Jerusalem, Saul attempted to join the disciples, but they were all afraid of him, as they did not believe that he was really a disciple.
044	ACT	009	027	Barnabas, however, taking him by the hand, brought him to the apostles, and told them the whole story of how Saul on his journey had seen the Lord, and how the Lord had talked to him, and how in Damascus he had spoken out fearlessly in the name of Jesus.
044	ACT	009	028	After that, Saul remained in Jerusalem, in close contact with the apostles; and he spoke fearlessly in the name of the Lord,
044	ACT	009	029	talking and arguing with the Jews of foreign birth, who, however, made attempts to kill him.
044	ACT	009	030	But, when the followers found this out, they took him down to Caesarea, and sent him on his way to Tarsus.
044	ACT	009	031	And so it came about that the church, throughout Judea, Galilee, and Samaria, enjoyed peace and became firmly established; and, ordering its life by respect for the Lord and the help of the Holy Spirit, it increased in numbers.
044	ACT	009	032	Peter, while traveling from place to place throughout the country, went down to visit the people of Christ living at Lydda.
044	ACT	009	033	There he found a man named Aeneas, who had been bedridden for eight years with paralysis.
044	ACT	009	034	‘Aeneas,’ Peter said to him, ‘Jesus Christ cures you. Get up, and make your bed.’ Aeneas got up at once;
044	ACT	009	035	and all the inhabitants of Lydda and of the Plain of Sharon saw him, and came over to the Lord’s side.
044	ACT	009	036	At Joppa there lived a disciple whose name was Tabitha, which is in Greek “Dorcas” – a Gazelle. Her life was spent in doing kind and charitable actions.
044	ACT	009	037	Just at that time she was taken ill, and died; and they had washed her body and laid it out in an upstairs room.
044	ACT	009	038	Joppa was near Lydda, and the disciples, having heard that Peter was at Lydda, sent two men with the request that he come to them without delay.
044	ACT	009	039	Peter returned with them at once. On his arrival, he was taken upstairs, and all the widows came round him in tears, showing the coats and other clothing which Dorcas had made while she was among them.
044	ACT	009	040	But Peter sent everybody out of the room, and knelt down and prayed. Then, turning to the body, he said, ‘Tabitha! Stand up.’ She opened her eyes, and, seeing Peter, sat up.
044	ACT	009	041	Giving her his hand, Peter raised her up, and, calling in the widows and others of Christ’s people, presented her to them alive.
044	ACT	009	042	This became known all through Joppa, and numbers of people came to believe in the Lord.
044	ACT	009	043	And Peter stayed some days at Joppa with a tanner named Simon.
044	ACT	010	001	At Caesarea there was a man named Cornelius, a centurion in the regiment known as the “Italian Regiment,”
044	ACT	010	002	A religious man and one who reverenced God, with all his household. He was liberal in his charities to the people, and prayed to God constantly.
044	ACT	010	003	One afternoon, about three o’clock, he distinctly saw in a vision an angel from God come to him, and call him by name.
044	ACT	010	004	Cornelius fixed his eyes on him and, in great alarm, said, ‘What is it, Lord?’ ‘Your prayers and your charities,’ the angel answered, ‘have been an acceptable offering to God.
044	ACT	010	005	And now, send messengers to Joppa and fetch a man called Simon, who is also known as Peter.
044	ACT	010	006	He is lodging with a tanner named Simon, who has a house near the sea.’
044	ACT	010	007	When the angel, who had spoken to him, had gone, Cornelius called two servants and a religious soldier, who was one of his constant attendants,
044	ACT	010	008	and, after telling them the whole story, sent them to Joppa.
044	ACT	010	009	On the next day, while these men were on their way, just as they were nearing the town, Peter went up on the housetop about midday to pray.
044	ACT	010	010	He became hungry and wanted something to eat; but while it was being prepared, he fell into a trance,
044	ACT	010	011	and saw that the heavens were open, and that something like a great sail was descending, let down by its four corners towards the earth.
044	ACT	010	012	In it were all kinds of quadrupeds, reptiles, and birds.
044	ACT	010	013	Then he was aware of a voice which said – ‘Stand up, Peter, kill something, and eat.’
044	ACT	010	014	‘No, Lord, I cannot,’ answered Peter, ‘for I have never eaten anything defiled and unclean.’
044	ACT	010	015	Again he was aware of a voice which said – ‘What God has pronounced clean, do not regard as defiled.’
044	ACT	010	016	This happened three times, and then suddenly it was all taken up into the heavens.
044	ACT	010	017	While Peter was still perplexed as to the meaning of the vision that he had seen, the men sent by Cornelius, having enquired the way to Simon’s house, came up to the gate,
044	ACT	010	018	and called out and asked if the Simon, who was also known as Peter, was lodging there.
044	ACT	010	019	Peter was still pondering over the vision, when the Spirit said to him, ‘There are two men looking for you at this moment.
044	ACT	010	020	Go down at once and do not hesitate to go with them, for I have sent them.’
044	ACT	010	021	Peter went down to the men and said, ‘I am the person you are looking for. What is your reason for coming?’
044	ACT	010	022	The men replied, ‘Our centurion, Cornelius, a pious man who reverences God and is well spoken of by the whole Jewish nation, has been instructed by a holy angel to send for you to his house, and to listen to what you have to say.’
044	ACT	010	023	So Peter invited them in and entertained them. The next day he lost no time in setting out with them, accompanied by some of the Lord’s followers from Joppa;
044	ACT	010	024	and the day following he entered Caesarea. Cornelius was expecting them, and had invited his relatives and intimate friends to meet them.
044	ACT	010	025	So, when Peter entered the city, Cornelius met him, and, throwing himself at Peter’s feet, bowed to the ground.
044	ACT	010	026	Peter, however, lifted him up, saying as he did so, ‘Stand up, I am only human like yourself.’
044	ACT	010	027	Talking with him as he went, Peter entered the house, where he found a large gathering of people, to whom he said,
044	ACT	010	028	‘You are doubtless aware that it is forbidden for a Jew to be intimate with a foreigner, or even to enter his house; and yet God has shown me that I ought not to call anyone defiled or unclean.
044	ACT	010	029	That was why I came, when I was sent for, without raising any objection. And now I ask your reason for sending for me.’
044	ACT	010	030	‘Just three days ago this very hour,’ Cornelius said, ‘I was in my house, saying the Afternoon Prayers, when a man in dazzling clothing suddenly stood before me.
044	ACT	010	031	“Cornelius,” he said, “your prayer has been heard, and your charities have been accepted, by God.
044	ACT	010	032	Therefore send to Joppa, and invite the Simon, who is also known as Peter, to come here. He is lodging in the house of Simon the tanner, near the sea.”
044	ACT	010	033	Accordingly I sent to you at once, and you have been so good as to come. And now we are all here in the presence of God, to listen to all that you have been instructed by the Lord to say.’
044	ACT	010	034	Then Peter began. ‘I see, beyond all doubt,’ he said, ‘that God does not show partiality,
044	ACT	010	035	but that in every nation he who reverences him and does what is right is acceptable to him.
044	ACT	010	036	God has sent his message to the Israelites and told them, through Jesus Christ, the good news of peace – and Jesus is Lord of all!
044	ACT	010	037	You yourselves know the story which spread through all Judea, how, beginning from Galilee, after the baptism which John proclaimed –
044	ACT	010	038	the story, I mean, of Jesus of Nazareth, and how God consecrated him his Christ by enduing him with the Holy Spirit and with power; and how he went about doing good and curing all who were under the power of the devil, because God was with him.
044	ACT	010	039	We are ourselves, too, witnesses to all that he did in Judea and in Jerusalem; yet they put him to death by hanging him on a cross!
044	ACT	010	040	This Jesus God raised on the third day, and enabled him to appear,
044	ACT	010	041	not indeed to everyone, but to witnesses chosen beforehand by God – to us, who ate and drank with him after his resurrection from the dead.
044	ACT	010	042	Further, God charged us to proclaim to the people, and solemnly affirm, that it is Jesus who has been appointed by God judge of the living and the dead.
044	ACT	010	043	To him it is that all the prophets bear witness, when they say that everyone who believes in him receives through his name forgiveness of sins.’
044	ACT	010	044	Before Peter had finished saying these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all who were listening to the message.
044	ACT	010	045	Those converts from Judaism, who had come with Peter, were amazed that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been bestowed even on the Gentiles;
044	ACT	010	046	for they heard them speaking in different languages and extolling God. At this Peter asked,
044	ACT	010	047	‘Can anyone refuse the water for the baptism of these people, now that they have received the Holy Spirit as we did ourselves?’
044	ACT	010	048	And he directed that they should be baptised in the name of Jesus Christ; after which they asked him to stay there a few days longer.
044	ACT	011	001	The apostles and the followers throughout Judea heard that even the Gentiles had welcomed God’s message.
044	ACT	011	002	But, when Peter went up to Jerusalem, those who were converts from Judaism began to attack him,
044	ACT	011	003	on the ground that he had visited people who were not circumcised, and had taken meals with them.
044	ACT	011	004	So Peter began to relate the facts to them as they had occurred.
044	ACT	011	005	‘I was in the town of Joppa,’ he said, ‘and was praying; and, while in a trance, I saw a vision. There was something like a great sail descending, let down by its four corners out of the heavens; and it came right down to me.
044	ACT	011	006	Looking intently at it, I began to distinguish quadrupeds, wild beasts, reptiles, and birds;
044	ACT	011	007	and I also heard a voice saying to me – “Stand up, Peter, kill something and eat.”
044	ACT	011	008	“No, Lord, I cannot,” I answered, “for nothing defiled or unclean has ever passed my lips.”
044	ACT	011	009	Then a second time there came a voice from the heavens. “What God has pronounced clean”, it said, “you must not call defiled.”
044	ACT	011	010	This happened three times, and then all was drawn up again into the heavens.
044	ACT	011	011	At that moment three men, who had been sent from Caesarea to see me, came up to the house in which we were.
044	ACT	011	012	The Spirit told me to go with them without hesitation. These six companions also went with me. And, when we came into the man’s house,
044	ACT	011	013	he told us how he had seen the angel standing in his house, and how the angel had said to him – “Send to Joppa and fetch the Simon, who is also known as Peter;
044	ACT	011	014	for he will tell you truths, which will prove the means of salvation to you and all your household.”
044	ACT	011	015	I had but just begun to speak,’ continued Peter, ‘when the Holy Spirit fell on them, exactly as on us at the first;
044	ACT	011	016	and I recalled the saying of the Master – “John baptised with water, but you will be baptised with the Holy Spirit.”
044	ACT	011	017	Since then, God had given them the very same gift as he gave us when we became believers in Jesus Christ the Master – who was I that I could thwart God?’
044	ACT	011	018	On hearing this statement, they said no more, but broke out into praise of God. ‘So even to the Gentiles,’ they exclaimed, ‘God has granted the repentance which leads to life!’
044	ACT	011	019	Now those who had been scattered in different directions, in consequence of the persecution that followed the death of Stephen, went as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, telling the message – but only to Jews.
044	ACT	011	020	Some of them, however, who were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, on coming to Antioch, addressed themselves also to the Jews of foreign birth, telling them the good news about that Lord Jesus.
044	ACT	011	021	The power of the Lord was with them, so that a great number who had learned to believe came over to the Lord’s side.
044	ACT	011	022	The news about them reached the ears of the church at Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch.
044	ACT	011	023	On coming there he saw to his great joy these tokens of the loving kindness of God, and encouraged them all to make up their minds to be faithful to the Lord –
044	ACT	011	024	For Barnabas was a good man and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith – and a large number of people took their stand on the Lord’s side.
044	ACT	011	025	Afterwards Barnabas left for Tarsus to look for Saul;
044	ACT	011	026	and, when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. And so it came about that, for a whole year, they attended the meetings of the church there, and taught a large number of people; and it was in Antioch that the disciples were first called “Christians.”
044	ACT	011	027	During this time, some prophets came to Antioch from Jerusalem.
044	ACT	011	028	One of them, named Agabus, came forward and, under the influence of the Spirit, foretold a great famine that was to spread over all the world – a famine which occurred in the reign of Claudius.
044	ACT	011	029	So the disciples, without exception, determined, in proportion to their means, to send something to help the followers living in Judea.
044	ACT	011	030	And this they did, sending it to the church elders by Barnabas and Saul.
044	ACT	012	001	It was at that time that King Herod began to ill-treat some of the members of the church.
044	ACT	012	002	He had James, the brother of John, beheaded;
044	ACT	012	003	and, when he saw that the Jews were pleased with this, he proceeded to arrest Peter also. (This was during the Festival of the unleavened bread.)
044	ACT	012	004	After seizing Peter, Herod put him in prison, and entrusted him to the keeping of four Guards of four soldiers each, intending, after the Passover, to bring him up before the people.
044	ACT	012	005	So Peter was kept in prison, but meanwhile the prayers of the church were being earnestly offered to God on his behalf.
044	ACT	012	006	Just when Herod was intending to bring him before the people, on that very night Peter was asleep between two soldiers, chained to them both, while there were sentries in front of the door, guarding the prison.
044	ACT	012	007	Suddenly an angel of the Lord stood by him, and a light shone in the cell. The angel struck Peter on the side, and roused him with the words, ‘Get up quickly.’
044	ACT	012	008	The chains dropped from his wrists, and then the angel said, ‘Put on your belt and sandals.’ When Peter had done so, the angel added, ‘Throw your cloak round you and follow me.’
044	ACT	012	009	Peter followed him out, not knowing that what was happening under the angel’s guidance was real, but thinking that he was seeing a vision.
044	ACT	012	010	Passing the first Guard, and then the second, they came to the iron gate leading into the city, which opened to them of itself; and, when they had passed through that, and had walked along one street, all at once the angel left him.
044	ACT	012	011	Then Peter came to himself and said, ‘Now I know beyond all doubt that the Lord has sent his angel, and has rescued me from Herod’s hands and from all that the Jewish people have been expecting.’
044	ACT	012	012	As soon as he realized what had happened, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John who was also known as Mark, where a number of people were gathered together, praying.
044	ACT	012	013	On his knocking at the door in the gate, a maidservant, named Rhoda, came to answer it.
044	ACT	012	014	She recognized Peter’s voice, but in her joy left the gate unopened, and ran in, and told them that Peter was standing outside.
044	ACT	012	015	‘You are mad!’ they exclaimed. But, when she persisted that it was so, they said, ‘It must be his spirit!’
044	ACT	012	016	Meanwhile Peter went on knocking, and, when they opened the gate and saw him, they were amazed.
044	ACT	012	017	Peter signed to them with his hand to be silent, and then told them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison, adding, ‘Tell James and the others all this.’ Then he left the house, and went away to another place.
044	ACT	012	018	In the morning there was a great stir among the soldiers – what could have become of Peter!
044	ACT	012	019	And, when Herod had made further search for him and failed to find him, he closely questioned the Guard, and ordered them away to execution. Then he went down from Judea to stay at Caesarea.
044	ACT	012	020	It happened that Herod was deeply offended with the people of Tyre and Sidon, but they went in a body to him, and, having succeeded in winning over Blastus, the Chamberlain, they begged Herod for a reconciliation, because their country was dependent on the king’s for its food supply.
044	ACT	012	021	On an appointed day Herod, wearing his state robes, seated himself on his throne, and delivered an oration.
044	ACT	012	022	The people kept shouting, ‘It is the voice of God, and not of a person!’
044	ACT	012	023	Instantly an angel of the Lord struck him, because he did not give God the glory; and he was attacked with worms, and died.
044	ACT	012	024	Meanwhile the Lord’s message kept extending, and spreading far and wide.
044	ACT	012	025	When Barnabas and Saul had carried out their mission, they returned to Jerusalem, and took with them John, who was also known as Mark.
044	ACT	013	001	Among the members of the church at Antioch there were several prophets and teachers – Barnabas, Simeon who was known by the name of “Black”, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen, foster-brother of Prince Herod, and Saul.
044	ACT	013	002	While they were engaged in the worship of the Lord and were fasting, the Holy Spirit said, ‘Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul, for the work to which I have called them.’
044	ACT	013	003	Accordingly, after fasting and prayer, they placed their hands on them and dismissed them.
044	ACT	013	004	Barnabas and Saul, sent on this mission, as they were, by the Holy Spirit, went down to Seleucia, and from there sailed to Cyprus.
044	ACT	013	005	On reaching Salamis, they began to tell the message of God in the Jewish synagogues; and they had John with them as an assistant.
044	ACT	013	006	After passing through the whole island, they reached Paphos, where they found an astrologer who pretended to be a prophet – a Jew by birth, whose name was Barjoshua.
044	ACT	013	007	He was at the court of the Governor, Sergius Paulus, a man of intelligence, who sent for Barnabas and Saul and asked to be told God’s message.
044	ACT	013	008	But Elymas, the astrologer (for that is the meaning of the word), opposed them, eager to divert the Governor’s attention from the faith.
044	ACT	013	009	However, Saul (who is the same as Paul), full of the Holy Spirit, fixed his eyes on him and said,
044	ACT	013	010	‘You incarnation of deceit and all fraud! You son of the devil! You opponent of all that is good! Will you never cease to divert the straight paths of the Lord? Listen!
044	ACT	013	011	The hand of the Lord is on you even now, and you will be blind for a time and unable to see the sun.’ Immediately a mist and darkness fell on him, and he went feeling about for someone to guide him.
044	ACT	013	012	When the Governor saw what had happened, he became a believer in Christ, being greatly impressed by the teaching about the Lord.
044	ACT	013	013	After this, Paul and his companions set sail from Paphos and went to Perga in Pamphylia, where John left them and returned to Jerusalem.
044	ACT	013	014	The others went on from Perga and arrived at Antioch in Pisidia. There they went into the synagogue on the Sabbath and took their seats.
044	ACT	013	015	After the reading of the Law and the prophets, the synagogue leader sent them this message – ‘Friends, if you have any helpful words to address to the people, now is the time to speak.’
044	ACT	013	016	So Paul rose and, motioning with his hand, said: ‘People of Israel and all here who worship God, hear what I have to say.
044	ACT	013	017	The God of this people Israel chose our ancestors, and during their stay in Egypt increased the prosperity of the people, and then with uplifted arm brought them out from that land.
044	ACT	013	018	For about forty years he bore with them in the desert;
044	ACT	013	019	then, after destroying seven heathen nations in Canaan, he allotted their land to this people –
044	ACT	013	020	For about four hundred and fifty years. In later times he gave them Judges, of whom the prophet Samuel was the last.
044	ACT	013	021	And, when they demanded a king, God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, who reigned for forty years.
044	ACT	013	022	After removing him, he raised David to the throne, and bore this testimony to him – “In David, the son of Jesse, I have found a man after my own heart, who will carry out all my purposes.”
044	ACT	013	023	It was from this man’s descendants that God, in accordance with his promise, gave Israel a Saviour – Jesus;
044	ACT	013	024	John having first proclaimed, before the appearance of Jesus, a baptism on repentance for all the people of Israel.
044	ACT	013	025	As John was drawing towards the end of his career, he said “What do you suppose that I am? I am not the Christ. But there is ‘one coming’ after me, whose sandal I am not worthy to untie.”
044	ACT	013	026	Brothers and sisters, descendants of Abraham, and all those among you who worship God, it was to us that the message of this salvation was sent.
044	ACT	013	027	The people of Jerusalem and their leaders, failing to recognise Jesus, and not understanding the utterances of the prophets that are read every Sabbath, fulfilled them by condemning him.
044	ACT	013	028	They found no ground at all for putting him to death, and yet demanded his execution from Pilate;
044	ACT	013	029	and, after carrying out everything written about him, they took Jesus down from the cross, and laid him in a tomb.
044	ACT	013	030	But God raised him from the dead;
044	ACT	013	031	and he appeared for many days to those who had gone up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, and who are now witnesses for him to the people.
044	ACT	013	032	We also have good news to tell you, about the promise made to our ancestors –
044	ACT	013	033	That our children have had this promise completely fulfilled to them by God, by his raising Jesus. That is just what is said in the second Psalm – “You are my Son; this day I have become your Father.”
044	ACT	013	034	As to his raising Jesus from the dead, never again to return to corruption, this is what is said – “I will give to you the sacred promises made to David;”
044	ACT	013	035	And, therefore, in another Psalm it is said – “You will not give up the Holy One to undergo corruption.”
044	ACT	013	036	David, after obediently doing God’s will in his own time, fell asleep and was laid by the side of his ancestors, and did undergo corruption;
044	ACT	013	037	but Jesus, whom God raised from the dead, did not undergo corruption.
044	ACT	013	038	I would, therefore, like you to know, friends, that through Jesus forgiveness of sins is being proclaimed to you,
044	ACT	013	039	and that, in union with him, everyone who believes in him is absolved from every sin from which under the Law of Moses you could not be absolved.
044	ACT	013	040	Beware, therefore, that what is said in the prophets does not come true of you –
044	ACT	013	041	“Look, you despisers, and wonder, and perish; for I am doing a deed in your days – a deed which, though told you in full, you will never believe”.’
044	ACT	013	042	As Paul and Barnabas were leaving the synagogue, the people begged for a repetition of this teaching on the next Sabbath.
044	ACT	013	043	After the congregation had dispersed, many of the Jews, and of the converts who joined in their worship, followed Paul and Barnabas, who talked with them and urged them to continue to rely on the loving kindness of God.
044	ACT	013	044	On the following Sabbath, almost all the city gathered to hear God’s message.
044	ACT	013	045	But the sight of the crowds of people filled the minds of the Jews with jealousy, and they kept contradicting Paul’s statements in violent language.
044	ACT	013	046	Then Paul and Barnabas spoke out fearlessly, and said: ‘It was necessary that the message of God should be told to you first; but, since you reject it and reckon yourselves not worthy of the eternal life – we turn to the Gentiles!
044	ACT	013	047	For this is the Lord’s command to us – “I have destined you for a light to the Gentiles, a means of salvation to the ends of the earth”.’
044	ACT	013	048	On hearing this, the Gentiles were glad and extolled God’s message; and all those who had been enrolled for eternal life became believers in Christ;
044	ACT	013	049	and the Lord’s message was carried throughout that district.
044	ACT	013	050	But the Jews incited the women of high social standing who worshiped with them, and the leading men of the town, and started a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and drove them out of their region.
044	ACT	013	051	They, however, shook the dust off their feet in protest,
044	ACT	013	052	and went to Iconium, leaving the disciples full of joy and of the Holy Spirit.
044	ACT	014	001	The same thing occurred in Iconium, where Paul and Barnabas went into the Jewish synagogue, and spoke in such a way that a great number of both Jews and Greeks believed in Christ.
044	ACT	014	002	But the Jews who refused to believe stirred up the Gentiles, and poisoned their minds against the Lord’s followers.
044	ACT	014	003	Therefore Paul and Barnabas spent a long time there, and spoke out fearlessly, relying on the Lord, who confirmed the message of his love by permitting signs and wonders to take place at their hands.
044	ACT	014	004	But the townspeople were divided, some siding with the Jews, some with the apostles;
044	ACT	014	005	and, when there was an attempt on the part of both Gentiles and Jews, with their leaders, to resort to violence and to stone them,
044	ACT	014	006	the apostles heard of it, and took refuge in Lystra and Derbe, towns in Lycaonia, and in the district round,
044	ACT	014	007	and there they continued to tell the good news.
044	ACT	014	008	In the streets of Lystra there used to sit a man who had no power in his feet; he had been lame from his birth, and had never walked.
044	ACT	014	009	This man was listening to Paul speaking, when Paul, looking intently at him, and seeing that he had the faith to be healed,
044	ACT	014	010	said loudly, ‘Stand upright on your feet.’ The man leaped up, and began walking about,
044	ACT	014	011	and the crowd, seeing what Paul had done, called out in the Lycaonian language, ‘The Gods have come down to us in human form.’
044	ACT	014	012	So they called Barnabas “Zeus,” and Paul “Hermes,” because he took the lead in speaking;
044	ACT	014	013	and the priest of Zeus-beyond-the-Walls, accompanied by the crowd, brought bullocks and garlands to the gates, with the intention of offering sacrifices.
044	ACT	014	014	But, when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it, they tore their clothes and rushed out into the crowd. ‘Friends, why are you doing this?’ they shouted.
044	ACT	014	015	‘We are only people like yourselves, and we have come with the good news that you should turn away from these follies to a living God, who made the heavens, the earth, the sea, and everything that is in them.
044	ACT	014	016	In bygone times he permitted all the nations to go their own ways.
044	ACT	014	017	Yet he has not failed to give you, in the good he does, some revelation of himself – sending you from heaven rain and fruitful seasons, and gladdening your hearts with plenty and good cheer.’
044	ACT	014	018	Even with this appeal they could hardly restrain the people from offering sacrifice to them.
044	ACT	014	019	Presently, however, there came some Jews from Antioch, and Iconium who, after they had won over the people, stoned Paul, and dragged him out of the town, thinking him to be dead.
044	ACT	014	020	But, when the disciples had gathered round him, he got up and went back into the town; the next day he went with Barnabas to Derbe.
044	ACT	014	021	After telling the good news throughout that town, and making a number of converts, they returned to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch,
044	ACT	014	022	reassuring the minds of the disciples, urging them to remain true to the faith, and showing that it is only through many troubles that we can enter the kingdom of God.
044	ACT	014	023	They also appointed elders for them in every church, and, after prayer and fasting, commended them to the Lord in whom they had learned to believe.
044	ACT	014	024	Paul and Barnabas then went through Pisidia, and came into Pamphylia,
044	ACT	014	025	and, after telling the message at Perga, went down to Attaleia.
044	ACT	014	026	From there they sailed to Antioch – the place where they had been committed to the gracious care of God for the work which they had now finished.
044	ACT	014	027	After their arrival, they gathered the church together, and gave an account of all that God had helped them to do, and especially how he had opened to the Gentiles the door of faith;
044	ACT	014	028	and at Antioch they stayed with the disciples for a considerable time.
044	ACT	015	001	But certain persons came down from Judea, and began to teach the Lord’s followers that, unless they were circumcised, in accordance with the custom required by Moses, they could not be saved.
044	ACT	015	002	This gave rise to a serious dispute, and much discussion, between Paul and Barnabas and these people, and it was therefore settled that Paul and Barnabas and others of their number should go up to Jerusalem, to consult the apostles and church elders about the matter under discussion.
044	ACT	015	003	The church, therefore, sent them on their journey, and they made their way through Phoenicia and Samaria, telling the story of the conversion of the Gentiles, to the great joy of all the followers.
044	ACT	015	004	On their arrival at Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church, as well as by the apostles and the elders, and gave an account of all that God had helped them to do.
044	ACT	015	005	Some of the Pharisees’ party, however, who had become believers in Christ, came forward and declared that they were bound to circumcise converts and to direct them to observe the Law of Moses.
044	ACT	015	006	The apostles and the church elders held a meeting to consider this question.
044	ACT	015	007	After much discussion, Peter rose and said: ‘You, my friends, know well that long ago God singled me out – that through my lips the Gentiles should hear the message of the good news, and become believers in Christ.
044	ACT	015	008	Now God, who reads all hearts, declared his acceptance of the Gentiles, by giving them the Holy Spirit, just as he did to us.
044	ACT	015	009	He made no distinction between them and us, when he purified their hearts by their faith.
044	ACT	015	010	Why, then, do you now provoke God, by putting on the necks of these disciples a yoke which neither our ancestors nor we were able to bear?
044	ACT	015	011	No, it is through the loving kindness of the Lord Jesus that we, just as they do, believe that we have been saved.’
044	ACT	015	012	Every voice in the assembly was hushed, as they listened to Barnabas and Paul, while they gave an account of all the signs and wonders which God had shown among the Gentiles through them.
044	ACT	015	013	After they had finished speaking, James addressed the Council. ‘Friends,’ he began, ‘hear what I have to say.
044	ACT	015	014	Simon has described the manner in which God first visited the Gentiles, in order to take from among them a people to bear his name.
044	ACT	015	015	And that is in harmony with the words of the prophets, where they say –
044	ACT	015	016	“After this I will return; and I will rebuild the house of David which has fallen – its ruins I will rebuild, and will set it up once more;
044	ACT	015	017	that so the rest of mankind may earnestly seek the Lord – even all the Gentiles on whom my name has been bestowed,
044	ACT	015	018	says the Lord, as he does these things, known from long ago.”
044	ACT	015	019	In my judgment, therefore, we should not add to the difficulties of those Gentiles who are turning to God,
044	ACT	015	020	but we should write to them to abstain from food that has been polluted by being sacrificed to idols, from impurity, from eating the flesh of strangled animals, and from blood.
044	ACT	015	021	For in every town, for generations past, there have been those who preach Moses, read as he is in the synagogues every Sabbath.’
044	ACT	015	022	It was then decided by the apostles and the elders, with the assent of the whole church, to choose some of their number, and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. Those chosen were Judas (called Barsabas) and Silas, who were leaders among the community.
044	ACT	015	023	They were bearers of the following letter – “The apostles, and the followers who are the church elders, send their greetings to the followers of the Lord of Gentile birth in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia.
044	ACT	015	024	As we had heard that some of our number had upset you by their assertions, and unsettled your minds – without instructions from us –
044	ACT	015	025	We met and decided to choose certain men and send them to you with our dear friends Barnabas and Paul,
044	ACT	015	026	who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ.
044	ACT	015	027	We are accordingly sending Judas and Silas, and they will tell you by word of mouth what we are now writing.
044	ACT	015	028	We have, therefore, decided, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, to lay no further burden on you beyond these necessary conditions –
044	ACT	015	029	That you abstain from food offered to idols, from blood, from eating the flesh of strangled animals, and from impurity. If you guard yourselves against such things, it will be well with you. Farewell.”
044	ACT	015	030	So the bearers of this letter were sent on their way, and went down to Antioch. There they called a meeting of all the followers,
044	ACT	015	031	and delivered the letter, the reading of which caused great rejoicing by its encouraging contents.
044	ACT	015	032	Judas and Silas, who were themselves prophets, further encouraged the them by many an address, and strengthened their faith.
044	ACT	015	033	After some stay, they were dismissed with kind farewells from the followers, and returned to those who had sent them.
044	ACT	015	035	Paul and Barnabas, however, remained in Antioch, where they taught and, with the help of many others, told the good news of the Lord’s message.
044	ACT	015	036	Some time after this, Paul said to Barnabas, ‘Let us go back and visit the Lord’s followers in every town in which we have told the Lord’s message, and see how they are prospering.’
044	ACT	015	037	Barnabas wished to take with them John, whose other name was Mark;
044	ACT	015	038	but Paul felt that they ought not to take with them the man who had deserted them in Pamphylia, and had not gone on with them to their work.
044	ACT	015	039	This caused such unpleasant feeling between them that they parted ways, Barnabas taking Mark and sailing for Cyprus,
044	ACT	015	040	while Paul chose Silas for his companion and, after he had been committed by the followers to the gracious care of the Lord,
044	ACT	015	041	started on his journey and went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches in the faith.
044	ACT	016	001	Among other places Paul went to Derbe and Lystra. At the latter place they found a disciple, named Timothy, whose mother was a Jewish woman who was a believer, while his father was a Greek,
044	ACT	016	002	and who was well spoken of by the followers of the Lord in Lystra and Iconium.
044	ACT	016	003	Wishing to take this man with him on his journey, Paul caused him to be circumcised out of consideration for the Jews in that region, for they all knew that his father had been a Greek.
044	ACT	016	004	As they traveled from town to town, they gave the followers the decisions which had been reached by the apostles and church elders at Jerusalem, for them to observe.
044	ACT	016	005	So the churches grew stronger in the faith, and increased in numbers from day to day.
044	ACT	016	006	They next went through the Phrygian district of Galatia, but were restrained by the Holy Spirit from delivering the message in Roman Asia.
044	ACT	016	007	When they reached the borders of Mysia, they attempted to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus did not permit them.
044	ACT	016	008	Passing through Mysia, they went down to Troas;
044	ACT	016	009	and there one night Paul saw a vision. A Macedonian was standing and appealing to him – “Come over to Macedonia and help us.”
044	ACT	016	010	So, immediately after Paul had seen the vision, we looked for an opportunity to cross over to Macedonia, concluding that God had summoned us to tell the good news to the people there.
044	ACT	016	011	Accordingly we set sail from Troas, and ran before the wind to Samothrace, reaching Neapolis the next day.
044	ACT	016	012	From there we made our way to Philippi, which is the principal city of that part of Macedonia, and also a Roman Settlement. In that city we spent several days.
044	ACT	016	013	On the Sabbath we went outside the gate to the riverside, where we supposed there would be a place of prayer; and we sat down and talked to the women who were gathered there.
044	ACT	016	014	Among them was a woman, named Lydia, belonging to Thyatira, a dealer in purple cloth, who was accustomed to join in the worship of God. The Lord touched this woman’s heart, so that she gave attention to the message delivered by Paul,
044	ACT	016	015	and, when she and her household had been baptised, she urged us to become her guests. ‘Since you have shown your conviction,’ she said, ‘that I really am a believer in the Lord, come and stay in my house.’ And she insisted on our doing so.
044	ACT	016	016	One day, as we were on our way to the place of prayer, we were met by a girl possessed by a divining spirit, who made large profits for her masters by fortune-telling.
044	ACT	016	017	This girl followed Paul and the rest of us, calling, ‘These men are servants of the most high God, and they are bringing you news of a way to salvation.’
044	ACT	016	018	She had been doing this for several days, when Paul, much vexed, turned and said to the spirit within her, ‘In the name of Jesus Christ I command you to leave her.’ That very moment the spirit left her.
044	ACT	016	019	When her masters saw that there was no hope of further profit from her, they seized Paul and Silas, dragged them into the public square to the authorities,
044	ACT	016	020	and took them before the Magistrates. ‘These men are causing a great disturbance in our town,’ they complained;
044	ACT	016	021	‘They are Jews, and they are teaching customs which it is not right for us, as Romans, to sanction or adopt.’
044	ACT	016	022	The mob rose as one person against them, and the Magistrates stripped them of their clothing and ordered them to be beaten with rods.
044	ACT	016	023	After beating them severely, the Magistrates put them in prison, with orders to the jailer to keep them in safe custody.
044	ACT	016	024	On receiving so strict an order, the Governor put them into the inner cell, and secured their feet in the stocks.
044	ACT	016	025	About midnight, while Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and while the prisoners were listening to them,
044	ACT	016	026	suddenly there was an earthquake of such violence that the jail was shaken to its foundations; all the doors flew open, and all the prisoners’ chains were loosened.
044	ACT	016	027	Roused from his sleep, and seeing the prison doors open, the Governor drew his sword intending to kill himself, in the belief that the prisoners had escaped.
044	ACT	016	028	But Paul called out loudly, ‘Do not harm yourself! We are all here.’
044	ACT	016	029	Calling for a light, the Governor rushed in, and flung himself trembling at the feet of Paul and Silas.
044	ACT	016	030	Then he led them out, and said, ‘What must I do to be saved?’
044	ACT	016	031	‘Believe in Jesus, our Lord,’ they replied, ‘and you will be saved, you and your household too.’
044	ACT	016	032	Then they spoke to him of God’s message, and to all his household as well.
044	ACT	016	033	And that very hour of the night he took them and washed their wounds, and he himself and everyone belonging to him were baptised without delay.
044	ACT	016	034	Afterwards he took them up to his house and set before them something to eat, rejoicing that he, with all his household, had come to believe in God.
044	ACT	016	035	In the morning the Magistrates sent the guards with an order for the men to be discharged.
044	ACT	016	036	The jailer told Paul of his instructions. ‘The Magistrates have sent an order for your discharge,’ he said, ‘so you had better leave the place at once and go quietly away.’
044	ACT	016	037	But Paul’s answer to them was, ‘They have flogged us in public without trial, though we are Roman citizens, and they have put us in prison, and now they are for sending us out secretly! No, indeed! Let them come and take us out themselves.’
044	ACT	016	038	The guards reported his words to the Magistrates, who, on hearing that Paul and Silas were Roman citizens, were alarmed,
044	ACT	016	039	and went to the prison, and did their best to conciliate them. Then they took them out, and begged them to leave the city.
044	ACT	016	040	When Paul and Silas left the prison, they went to Lydia’s house, and, after they had seen the Lord’s followers, and encouraged them, they left the place.
044	ACT	017	001	After passing through Amphipolis and Apollonia, Paul and Silas came to Thessalonica. Here the Jews had a synagogue;
044	ACT	017	002	and, following his usual custom, Paul joined them, and for three Sabbaths addressed them, drawing his arguments from the scriptures.
044	ACT	017	003	He laid before them and explained that the Christ must undergo suffering and rise from the dead; and ‘It is this man,’ he declared, ‘who is the Christ – this Jesus about whom I am telling you.’
044	ACT	017	004	Some of the people were convinced, and threw in their lot with Paul and Silas, as did also a large body of Greeks who were accustomed to join in the Jewish services, and a great number of leading women.
044	ACT	017	005	But the Jewish leaders, becoming jealous, engaged some worthless fellows from the streets, and, getting a mob together, kept the city in an uproar. They attacked Jason’s house, with the intention of bringing Paul and Silas before the Popular Assembly;
044	ACT	017	006	and, not finding them there, they proceeded to drag Jason and some of the Lord’s followers before the city magistrates, shouting out, ‘These men, who have turned the world upside down, have now come here,
044	ACT	017	007	and have been harboured by Jason! They are all defying the decrees of the Emperor. They say that someone else is king – a man called Jesus!’
044	ACT	017	008	On hearing this, the people and the city magistrates were much concerned;
044	ACT	017	009	and, before letting them go, they took bail from Jason and the others.
044	ACT	017	010	That very night the followers sent Paul and Silas off to Beroea; and on reaching that place, they went to the Jewish synagogue.
044	ACT	017	011	These Jews of Beroea were better disposed than those in Thessalonica, for they welcomed the message with great readiness, and daily examined the scriptures to see if what was said was true.
044	ACT	017	012	As a consequence, many of them became believers in Christ, besides a considerable number of Greek women of position, and of men also.
044	ACT	017	013	But, when the Jewish leaders in Thessalonica found out that God’s message had been delivered by Paul at Beroea, they came there too, exciting and disturbing the minds of the people.
044	ACT	017	014	The followers immediately arranged for Paul to go away to the coast, but both Silas and Timothy stayed behind in Beroea.
044	ACT	017	015	The friends who escorted Paul took him as far as Athens, and, after receiving a message for Silas and Timothy to join him as quickly as possible, they started on their return.
044	ACT	017	016	While Paul was waiting for them at Athens, his heart was stirred at seeing the whole city full of idols.
044	ACT	017	017	So he argued in the synagogue with the Jews and with those who joined in their worship, as well as daily in the public Square with those who happened to be there.
044	ACT	017	018	Among others, some Epicurean and Stoic Philosophers joined issue with him. Some asked ‘What is this prater wanting to make out?’, while others said ‘He seems to be a preacher of foreign Deities.’ (This was because he was telling the good news about Jesus and the resurrection).
044	ACT	017	019	So they laid hold of him and took him to the Court of Areopagus. ‘May we hear,’ they asked, ‘what new teaching this is which you are giving?
044	ACT	017	020	For you are bringing some strange things to our notice, and we should like to know what they mean.’
044	ACT	017	021	(All Athenians and the foreigners staying in the city found no time for anything else but telling, or listening to, the last new thing.)
044	ACT	017	022	So Paul took his stand in the middle of the Court, and said – ‘People of Athens, on every hand I see signs of your being very devout.
044	ACT	017	023	For as I was going about, looking at your sacred shrines, I came upon an altar with this inscription – “To an Unknown God.” What, therefore, you worship in ignorance, that I am now proclaiming to you.
044	ACT	017	024	The God who made the world and all things that are in it – he, Lord as he is of heaven and earth, does not live in temples made by hands,
044	ACT	017	025	neither do human hands minister to his wants, as though he needed anything, since he himself gives, to all, life, and breath, and all things.
044	ACT	017	026	He made all races of the earth’s surface – fixing a time for their rise and fall, and the limits of their settlements –
044	ACT	017	027	That they might search for God, if by any means they might feel their way to him and find him. And yet he is not really far from any one of us;
044	ACT	017	028	for in him we live and move and are. To use the words of some of your own poets – “His offspring, too, are we.”
044	ACT	017	029	Therefore, as the offspring of God, we must not think that the Deity has any resemblance to anything made of gold, or silver, or stone – a work of human art and imagination.
044	ACT	017	030	True, God looked with indulgence on the days of people’s ignorance, but now he is announcing to everyone everywhere the need for repentance,
044	ACT	017	031	because he has fixed a day on which he intends to judge the world with justice, by a man whom he has appointed – and of this he has given all people a pledge by raising this man from the dead.’
044	ACT	017	032	On hearing of a resurrection of the dead, some began jeering, but others said that they wanted to hear what he had to say about that another time.
044	ACT	017	033	And so Paul left the Court.
044	ACT	017	034	There were, however, some people who joined him, and became believers in Christ. Among them were Dionysius, a member of the Court of Areopagus, a woman named Damaris, and several others.
044	ACT	018	001	On leaving Athens, Paul next went to Corinth.
044	ACT	018	002	There he met a Jew of the name of Aquila, from Pontus, who, with his wife Priscilla, had lately come from Italy, in consequence of the order which had been issued by the Emperor Claudius for all Jews to leave Rome. Paul paid them a visit,
044	ACT	018	003	and, since their trade was the same as his, he stayed and worked with them – their trade was tent-making.
044	ACT	018	004	Every Sabbath Paul gave addresses in the synagogue, trying to convince both Jews and Greeks.
044	ACT	018	005	But, when Silas and Timothy had come down from Macedonia, Paul devoted himself entirely to delivering the message, earnestly maintaining before the Jews that Jesus was the Christ.
044	ACT	018	006	However, as they set themselves against him and became abusive, Paul shook his clothes in protest and said to them, ‘Your blood be on your own heads. My conscience is clear. From this time forward I will go to the Gentiles.’
044	ACT	018	007	So he left, and went to the house of a certain Titius Justus, who had been accustomed to join in the worship of God, and whose house was next door to the synagogue.
044	ACT	018	008	Crispus, the synagogue leader, came to believe in the Lord, and so did all his household; and many of the Corinthians, as they listened to Paul, became believers in Christ and were baptised.
044	ACT	018	009	One night the Lord said to Paul, in a vision, ‘Have no fear, but continue to speak, and refuse to be silenced;
044	ACT	018	010	for I am with you, and no one will do you harm, for I have many people in this city.’
044	ACT	018	011	So he settled there for a year and a half, and taught God’s message among the people.
044	ACT	018	012	While Gallio was governor of Greece, some of the Jewish leaders made a combined attack on Paul, and brought him before the Governor’s Bench,
044	ACT	018	013	charging him with persuading people to worship God in a way forbidden by the Law.
044	ACT	018	014	Just as Paul was on the point of speaking, Gallio said to them, ‘If this were a case of misdemeanour or some serious crime, there would be some reason for my listening patiently to you;
044	ACT	018	015	but, since it is a dispute about words, and names, and your own Law, you must see to it yourselves. I do not choose to be a judge in such matters.’
044	ACT	018	016	Saying this, he drove them back from the Bench.
044	ACT	018	017	Then they all set on Sosthenes, the synagogue leader, and beat him in front of the Bench, but Gallio did not trouble himself about any of these things.
044	ACT	018	018	Paul remained there some time after this, and then took leave of the followers, and sailed to Syria with Priscilla and Aquila, but not before his head had been shaved at Cenchreae, because he was under a vow.
044	ACT	018	019	They put into Ephesus, and there Paul, leaving his companions, went into the synagogue and addressed the Jews.
044	ACT	018	020	When they asked him to prolong his stay, he declined, saying however,
044	ACT	018	021	as he took his leave, ‘I will come back again to you, please God,’ and then set sail from Ephesus.
044	ACT	018	022	On reaching Caesarea, he went up to Jerusalem and exchanged greetings with the church, and then went down to Antioch.
044	ACT	018	023	After making some stay in Antioch, he set out on a tour through the Phrygian district of Galatia, strengthening the faith of all the disciples as he went.
044	ACT	018	024	Meanwhile there had come to Ephesus an Alexandrian Jew, named Apollos, an eloquent man, who was well-versed in the scriptures.
044	ACT	018	025	He had been well-instructed in the Way of the Lord, and with burning zeal he spoke of, and taught carefully, the facts about Jesus, though he knew of no baptism but John’s.
044	ACT	018	026	This man began to speak out fearlessly in the synagogue; and when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him home and explained the Way of God to him more carefully still.
044	ACT	018	027	When he wanted to cross to Greece, the followers furthered his plans, and wrote to the disciples there to welcome him. On his arrival he proved of great assistance to those who had, through the loving kindness of God, become believers in Christ,
044	ACT	018	028	for he vigorously confuted the Jews, publicly proving by the scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.
044	ACT	019	001	While Apollos was at Corinth, Paul passed through the inland districts of Roman Asia, and went to Ephesus. There he found some disciples, of whom he asked,
044	ACT	019	002	‘Did you, when you became believers in Christ, receive the Holy Spirit?’ ‘No,’ they answered, ‘we did not even hear that there was a Holy Spirit.’
044	ACT	019	003	‘What then was your baptism?’ Paul asked.
044	ACT	019	004	‘John’s baptism was a baptism on repentance,’ rejoined Paul, ‘and John told the people (speaking of the “one coming” after him) that they should believe in him – that is in Jesus.’
044	ACT	019	005	On hearing this, they were baptised in the name of the Lord Jesus,
044	ACT	019	006	and, after Paul had placed his hands on them, the Holy Spirit descended on them, and they began to speak in other languages and to preach.
044	ACT	019	007	There were about twelve of them in all.
044	ACT	019	008	Paul went to the synagogue there, and for three months spoke out fearlessly, giving addresses and trying to convince his hearers, about the kingdom of God.
044	ACT	019	009	Some of them, however, hardened their hearts and refused to believe, denouncing the Way before the people. So Paul left them and withdrew his disciples, and gave daily addresses in the lecture-hall of Tyrannus.
044	ACT	019	010	This went on for two years, so that all who lived in Roman Asia, Jews and Greeks alike, heard the Lord’s message.
044	ACT	019	011	God did miracles of no ordinary kind by Paul’s hands;
044	ACT	019	012	so that people would carry home to the sick handkerchiefs or aprons that had touched his body, and their diseases would leave them and the wicked spirits go out of them.
044	ACT	019	013	An attempt was made by some itinerant Jews, who were exorcists, to use the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had wicked spirits in them. ‘I order you,’ they would say, ‘by the Jesus, whom Paul preaches.’
044	ACT	019	014	The seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, were doing this;
044	ACT	019	015	but the wicked spirit answered them, ‘Jesus I acknowledge, and Paul I know, but you – who are you?’
044	ACT	019	016	Then the man with the wicked spirit sprang on them, overpowered them, with such violence that they fled out of the house, stripped of their clothes and wounded.
044	ACT	019	017	This incident came to the knowledge of all the Jews and Greeks living at Ephesus; they were all awe-struck, and the name of the Lord Jesus was held in the highest honour.
044	ACT	019	018	Many, too, of those who had become believers in Christ came with a full confession of their practices;
044	ACT	019	019	while a number of people, who had practiced magic, collected their books and burnt them publicly; and on reckoning up the price of these, they found it amounted to fifty thousand silver coins.
044	ACT	019	020	So irresistibly did the Lord’s message spread and prevail.
044	ACT	019	021	Sometime after these events Paul resolved to go through Macedonia and Greece, and then make his way to Jerusalem. ‘And after I have been there,’ he said, ‘I must visit Rome also.’
044	ACT	019	022	So he sent to Macedonia two of his helpers, Timothy and Erastus, while he himself stayed for some time longer in Roman Asia.
044	ACT	019	023	Just about that time a great disturbance arose about the Way.
044	ACT	019	024	A silversmith named Demetrius, who made silver models of the shrine of Artemis, and so gave a great deal of work to the artisans,
044	ACT	019	025	got these men together, as well as the workmen engaged in similar occupations, and said: ‘Men, you know that our prosperity depends on this work,
044	ACT	019	026	and you see and hear that not only at Ephesus, but in almost the whole of Roman Asia, this Paul has convinced and won over great numbers of people, by his assertion that those Gods which are made by hands are not Gods at all.
044	ACT	019	027	So that not only is this business of ours likely to fall into discredit, but there is the further danger that the Temple of the great Goddess Artemis will be thought nothing of, and that she herself will be deprived of her splendour – though all Roman Asia and the whole world worship her.’
044	ACT	019	028	When they heard this, the men were greatly enraged, and began shouting – ‘Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!’
044	ACT	019	029	The commotion spread through the whole city, and the people rushed together into the amphitheater, dragging with them Gaius and Aristarchus, two Macedonians who were Paul’s traveling companions.
044	ACT	019	030	Paul wished to go into the amphitheater and face the people, but the disciples would not let him,
044	ACT	019	031	while some of the chief religious officials of the province, who were friendly to him, sent repeated entreaties to him not to trust himself inside.
044	ACT	019	032	Meanwhile some were shouting one thing and some another, for the Assembly was all in confusion, most of those present not even knowing why they had met.
044	ACT	019	033	But some of the crowd prompted Alexander, whom several of the Jewish leaders had pushed to the front, and he waved his hand to show that he wanted to speak in their defence to the people.
044	ACT	019	034	However, when they recognised him as a Jew, one cry broke from them all, and they continued shouting for two hours – ‘Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!’
044	ACT	019	035	When the Recorder had succeeded in quieting the crowd, he said, ‘People of Ephesus, who is there, I ask you, who needs to be told that this city of Ephesus is the Warden of the Temple of the great Artemis, and of the statue which fell down from Zeus?
044	ACT	019	036	As these are undeniable facts, you ought to keep calm and do nothing rash;
044	ACT	019	037	for you have brought these men here, though they are neither robbers of Temples nor blasphemers of our Goddess.
044	ACT	019	038	If, however, Demetrius and the artisans who are acting with him have a charge to make against anyone, there are court days and there are Magistrates; let both parties take legal proceedings.
044	ACT	019	039	But if you want anything more, it will have to be settled in the regular Assembly.
044	ACT	019	040	For I tell you that we are in danger of being proceeded against for today’s riot, there being nothing to account for it; and in that case we will be at a loss to give any reason for this disorderly gathering.’
044	ACT	019	041	With these words he dismissed the Assembly.
044	ACT	020	001	When the uproar had ceased, Paul sent for the disciples, and, with encouraging words, said goodbye to them, and started on his journey to Macedonia.
044	ACT	020	002	After going through those districts and speaking many encouraging words to the disciples, he went into Greece, where he stayed three months.
044	ACT	020	003	He was about to sail to Syria, when he learned that a plot had been laid against him by several of the Jewish leaders; so he decided to return by way of Macedonia.
044	ACT	020	004	He was accompanied by Sopater the son of Pyrrhus, of Beroea, Aristarchus and Secundus from Thessalonica, Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy, as well as by Tychicus and Trophimus of Roman Asia.
044	ACT	020	005	These people went to Troas and waited for us there;
044	ACT	020	006	while we ourselves sailed from Philippi after the Passover, and joined them five days later at Troas, where we stayed for a week.
044	ACT	020	007	On the first day of the week, when we had met for the breaking of bread, Paul, who was intending to leave the next day, began to address those who were present, and prolonged his address until midnight.
044	ACT	020	008	There were a good many lamps in the upstairs room, where we had met;
044	ACT	020	009	and a young man named Eutychus, sitting at the window, was gradually overcome with great drowsiness, as Paul continued his address. At last, quite overpowered by his drowsiness, he fell from the third story to the ground, and was picked up for dead.
044	ACT	020	010	But Paul went down, threw himself on him, and put his arms round him. ‘Do not be alarmed,’ he said, ‘he is still alive.’
044	ACT	020	011	Then he went upstairs; and, after breaking and partaking of the bread, he talked with them at great length until daybreak, and then left.
044	ACT	020	012	Meanwhile they had taken the boy away alive, and were greatly comforted.
044	ACT	020	013	We started first, went on board ship, and sailed for Assos, intending to take Paul on board there. This was by his own arrangement, as he intended to go by land himself.
044	ACT	020	014	So, when he met us at Assos, we took him on board and went on to Mitylene.
044	ACT	020	015	The day after we had sailed from there, we arrived off Chios, touched at Samos the following day, and the next day reached Miletus;
044	ACT	020	016	for Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus, so as to avoid spending much time in Roman Asia. He was making haste to reach Jerusalem, if possible, by the Festival at the close of the Harvest.
044	ACT	020	017	From Miletus, however, he sent to Ephesus and invited the church elders to meet him;
044	ACT	020	018	and, when they came, he said to them, ‘You know well the life that I always led among you from the very first day that I set foot in Roman Asia,
044	ACT	020	019	serving the Lord, as I did, in all humility, amid the tears and trials which fell to my lot through the plots of some of the Jewish leaders.
044	ACT	020	020	I never shrank from telling you anything that could be helpful to you, or from teaching you both in public and in private.
044	ACT	020	021	I earnestly pointed both Jews and Greeks to the repentance that leads to God, and to faith in Jesus, our Lord.
044	ACT	020	022	And now, under spiritual constraint, I am here on my way to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there,
044	ACT	020	023	except that in town after town the Holy Spirit plainly declares to me that imprisonment and troubles await me.
044	ACT	020	024	But I count my life of no value to myself, if only I may complete the course marked out for me, and the task that was allotted me by the Lord Jesus – which was to declare the good news of the love of God.
044	ACT	020	025	And now, I tell you, I know that none of you will ever see my face again – you among whom I have gone about proclaiming the kingdom.
044	ACT	020	026	Therefore I declare to you this day, that my conscience is clear in regard to the fate of any of you,
044	ACT	020	027	for I have not shrunk from announcing the whole purpose of God regarding you.
044	ACT	020	028	Be watchful over yourselves, and over the whole flock, of which the Holy Spirit has placed you in charge, to shepherd the church of God, which he won for himself at the cost of his life.
044	ACT	020	029	I know that, after my departure, merciless wolves will get in among you, who will not spare the flock;
044	ACT	020	030	and from among yourselves, too, people will arise, who will teach perversions of truth, so as to draw away the disciples after them.
044	ACT	020	031	Therefore, be on your guard, remembering how for three years, night and day, I never ceased, even with tears, to warn each one of you.
044	ACT	020	032	And now I commend you to the Lord and to the message of his love – a message which has the power to build up your characters, and to give you your place among all those who have become Christ’s people.
044	ACT	020	033	I have never coveted anyone’s gold or silver or clothing.
044	ACT	020	034	You, yourselves, know that these hands of mine provided not only for my own wants, but for my companions also.
044	ACT	020	035	I left nothing undone to show you that, labouring as I laboured, you ought to help the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said himself – “It is more blessed to give than to receive.”’
044	ACT	020	036	When Paul had finished speaking, he knelt down and prayed with them all.
044	ACT	020	037	All were in tears; and throwing their arms round Paul’s neck, they kissed him again and again,
044	ACT	020	038	grieving most of all over what he had said – that they would never see his face again. Then they escorted him to the ship.
044	ACT	021	001	When we had torn ourselves away and had set sail, we ran before the wind to Cos; the next day we came to Rhodes, and from there to Patara,
044	ACT	021	002	where we found a ship crossing to Phoenicia, and went on board and set sail.
044	ACT	021	003	After sighting Cyprus and leaving it on the left, we sailed to Syria, and put into Tyre, where the ship was to discharge her cargo.
044	ACT	021	004	There we found the disciples and stayed a week with them. Speaking under the influence of the Spirit, they warned Paul not to set foot in Jerusalem.
044	ACT	021	005	However, when we had come to the end of our visit, we went on our way, all the disciples with their wives and children escorting us out of the city. We knelt down on the beach, and prayed,
044	ACT	021	006	and then said goodbye to one another; after which we went on board, and they returned home.
044	ACT	021	007	After we had made the run from Tyre, we landed at Ptolemais, and exchanged greetings with the followers there, and spent a day with them.
044	ACT	021	008	The next day we left, and reached Caesarea, where we went to the house of Philip, the missionary, who was one of the Seven, and stayed with him.
044	ACT	021	009	He had four unmarried daughters, who had the gift of prophecy.
044	ACT	021	010	During our visit, which lasted several days, a prophet, named Agabus, came down from Judea.
044	ACT	021	011	He came to see us, and, taking Paul’s belt, and binding his own feet and hands with it, said, ‘This is what the Holy Spirit says – “The man to whom this belt belongs will be bound like this by the religious authorities in Jerusalem, and they will give him up to the Gentiles”.’
044	ACT	021	012	When we heard that, we and the people of the place began to entreat Paul not to go up to Jerusalem.
044	ACT	021	013	It was then that Paul made the reply, ‘Why are you weeping and breaking my heart like this? For my part, I am ready not only to be bound, but even to suffer death at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.’
044	ACT	021	014	So, as he would not be persuaded, we said no more to him, only adding – ‘The Lord’s will be done.’
044	ACT	021	015	At the end of our visit, we made our preparations, and started on our way up to Jerusalem.
044	ACT	021	016	Some of the disciples from Caesarea went with us, and brought Mnason with them, a Cypriot disciple of long standing, with whom we were to stay.
044	ACT	021	017	On our arrival at Jerusalem, the followers of the Lord there gave us a hearty welcome;
044	ACT	021	018	and the next day Paul went with us to see James, and all the church elders were present.
044	ACT	021	019	After greeting them, Paul related in detail all that God had done among the Gentiles through his efforts;
044	ACT	021	020	and, when they had heard it, they began praising God, and said to Paul: ‘You see, brother, that those of our people who have become believers in Christ may be numbered by tens of thousands, and they are all naturally earnest in upholding the Jewish Law.
044	ACT	021	021	Now they have heard it said about you, that you teach all of our people in foreign countries to forsake Moses, for you tell them not to circumcise their children or even to observe Jewish customs.
044	ACT	021	022	Well now, as they are certain to hear of your arrival, do what we are going to suggest.
044	ACT	021	023	We have four men here, who have of their own accord put themselves under a vow.
044	ACT	021	024	Join these men, share their purification, and bear their expenses, so that they may shave their heads; and then all will see that there is no truth in what they have been told about you, but that, on the contrary, you yourself rule your life in obedience to the Jewish Law.
044	ACT	021	025	As to the Gentiles who have become believers in Christ, we have sent our decision that they should avoid food offered to idols, and blood, and the flesh of strangled animals, and impurity.’
044	ACT	021	026	Paul joined the men, and the next day shared their purification, and went into the Temple, and gave notice of the expiration of the period of purification when the usual offering should have been made on behalf of each of them.
044	ACT	021	027	But, just as the seven days were drawing to a close, some of the Jewish people from Roman Asia caught sight of Paul in the Temple, and caused great excitement among all the people present, by seizing Paul and shouting,
044	ACT	021	028	‘People of Israel! Help! This is the man who teaches everyone everywhere against our people, our Law, and this place; and, what is more, he has actually brought Greeks into the Temple and defiled this sacred place.’
044	ACT	021	029	(For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian in Paul’s company in the city, and were under the belief that Paul had taken him into the Temple.)
044	ACT	021	030	The whole city was stirred, and the people quickly collected, seized Paul, and dragged him out of the Temple, when the doors were immediately shut.
044	ACT	021	031	They were bent on killing him, when it was reported to the officer commanding the garrison, that all Jerusalem was in commotion.
044	ACT	021	032	He instantly got together some officers and soldiers, and charged down on the crowd, who, when they saw the commanding officer and his soldiers, stopped beating Paul.
044	ACT	021	033	Then he went up to Paul, arrested him, ordered him to be doubly chained, and proceeded to inquire who he was, and what he had been doing.
044	ACT	021	034	Some of the crowd said one thing, and some another; and, as he could get no definite reply because of the uproar, he ordered Paul to be taken into the barracks.
044	ACT	021	035	When Paul reached the steps, he was actually being carried by the soldiers, owing to the violence of the mob;
044	ACT	021	036	for the people were following in a mass, shouting out, ‘Kill him!’
044	ACT	021	037	Just as he was about to be taken into the Fort, Paul said to the commanding officer, ‘May I speak to you?’ ‘Do you know Greek?’ asked the commanding officer.
044	ACT	021	038	‘Aren’t you, then, the Egyptian who some time ago raised an insurrection and led the four thousand Bandits out into the wilderness?’
044	ACT	021	039	‘No,’ said Paul, ‘I am a Jew of Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of a city of some note. I beg you to give me permission to speak to the people.’
044	ACT	021	040	The commanding officer gave his permission, and Paul, standing on the steps, made signs with his hand to the people, and, when comparative silence had been obtained, he said to them in Hebrew:
044	ACT	022	001	‘Brothers and fathers, listen to the defence which I am about to make.’
044	ACT	022	002	When they heard that he was speaking to them in Hebrew, they were still more quiet; and Paul went on:
044	ACT	022	003	‘I am a Jew, from Tarsus in Cilicia, but I was brought up in this city under the teaching of Gamaliel, and educated in accordance with the strict system of our ancestral Law. I was as zealous in God’s service as any of you who are here today.
044	ACT	022	004	In my persecution of this Way I did not stop even at the taking of life. I put in chains, and imprisoned, men and women alike –
044	ACT	022	005	And to that the high priest himself and all the council of elders can testify. For I had letters of introduction from them to our fellow Jews at Damascus, and I was on my way to that place, to bring those whom I might find there prisoners to Jerusalem for punishment.
044	ACT	022	006	While I was still on my way, just as I was getting close to Damascus, about midday, suddenly there flashed from the heavens a great light all round me.
044	ACT	022	007	I fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to me “Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?”
044	ACT	022	008	“Who are you, Lord?” I replied. Then the voice said “I am Jesus of Nazareth whom you are persecuting.”
044	ACT	022	009	The men with me saw the light, but did not hear the speaker’s voice.
044	ACT	022	010	Then I said “What am I to do, Lord?” “Get up and go into Damascus,” The Lord said to me, “and there you will be told all that you have been appointed to do.”
044	ACT	022	011	In consequence of that dazzling light I could not see, but my companions held me by the hand, until I reached Damascus.
044	ACT	022	012	There a man named Ananias, a strict observer of our Law, well spoken of by all the Jewish inhabitants, came to see me.
044	ACT	022	013	Standing close to me, he said “Saul, my brother, recover your sight.” And then and there I recovered my sight and looked up at him.
044	ACT	022	014	Then he said “The God of our ancestors has appointed you to learn his will, and to see the righteous one, and to hear words from his lips;
044	ACT	022	015	for you will be a witness for him to all the world of what you have just seen and heard.
044	ACT	022	016	And now why wait any longer, Be baptised at once, wash away your sins, and invoke his name.”
044	ACT	022	017	After my return to Jerusalem, while I was praying one day in the Temple, I fell into a trance,
044	ACT	022	018	and saw Jesus saying to me “Make haste and leave Jerusalem at once, because they will not accept your testimony about me.”
044	ACT	022	019	“Lord,” I answered, “these people know that I used to imprison and scourge, in synagogue after synagogue, those who believed in you;
044	ACT	022	020	and, when the blood of your martyr, Stephen, was being shed, I was myself standing by, approving of his death, and took charge of the clothes of those who were murdering him.”
044	ACT	022	021	But Jesus said to me “Go; for I will send you to the Gentiles far away”.’
044	ACT	022	022	Up to this point the people had been listening to Paul, but at these words they called out, ‘Kill him! A fellow like this ought not to have been allowed to live!’
044	ACT	022	023	As they were shouting, tearing off their clothes, and throwing dust in the air,
044	ACT	022	024	the commanding officer ordered Paul to be taken into the Fort, and directed that he should be examined under the lash so that he might find out the reason for their outcry against him.
044	ACT	022	025	But just as they had tied him up to be scourged, Paul said to the centurion standing near, ‘Is it legal for you to scourge a Roman citizen, unconvicted?’
044	ACT	022	026	On hearing this, the centurion went and reported it to the commanding officer. ‘Do you know what you are doing?’ he said. ‘This man is a Roman citizen.’
044	ACT	022	027	So the commanding officer went up to Paul and said, ‘Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?’ ‘Yes,’ replied Paul.
044	ACT	022	028	‘I had to pay a heavy price for my position as citizen,’ said the officer. ‘I am one by birth,’ rejoined Paul.
044	ACT	022	029	The men who were to have examined Paul immediately drew back, and the officer, finding that Paul was a Roman citizen, was alarmed at having put him in chains.
044	ACT	022	030	On the next day the commanding officer, wishing to find out the real reason why Paul was denounced by the Jewish leaders, had his chains taken off, and directed the chief priests and the whole of the High Council to assemble, and then took Paul down and brought him before them.
044	ACT	023	001	Paul fixed his eyes on the Council, and began: ‘Brothers, for my part, I have always ordered my life before God, with a clear conscience, up to this very day.’
044	ACT	023	002	At this, the high priest Ananias ordered the men standing near to strike him on the mouth;
044	ACT	023	003	Paul turned to him and said: ‘God will strike you, you whitewashed wall! Are you sitting there to try me in accordance with law, and yet, in defiance of law, order me to be struck?’
044	ACT	023	004	The people standing near said to Paul, ‘Do you know that you are insulting God’s high priest?’
044	ACT	023	005	‘I did not know, brothers, that it was the high priest,’ said Paul, ‘for scripture says – “Of the ruler of your people you should speak no ill”.’
044	ACT	023	006	Noticing that some of those present were Sadducees and others Pharisees, Paul called out in the Council, ‘Brothers, I am a Pharisee and a son of Pharisees. It is on the question of hope for the dead and of their resurrection that I am on my trial.’
044	ACT	023	007	As soon as he said this, a dispute arose between the Pharisees and the Sadducees; and there was a sharp division of opinion among those present.
044	ACT	023	008	(For Sadducees say there is no such thing as a resurrection, and that there is neither angel nor spirit, while Pharisees believe in both.)
044	ACT	023	009	So a great uproar ensued, and some of the Teachers of the Law belonging to the Pharisees’ party stood up and hotly protested, ‘We find nothing whatever wrong in this man. Suppose a spirit did speak to him, or an angel…’
044	ACT	023	010	The dispute was becoming so violent, that the commanding officer, fearing that Paul would be torn in pieces between them, ordered the Guard to go down and rescue him from them, and take him into the Fort.
044	ACT	023	011	That night the Lord came and stood by Paul, and said, ‘Courage! You have borne witness for me in Jerusalem and you must bear witness in Rome also.’
044	ACT	023	012	In the morning some Jewish men combined together, and took an oath that they would not eat or drink until they had killed Paul.
044	ACT	023	013	There were more than forty in the plot;
044	ACT	023	014	and they went to the chief priests and the elders, and said, ‘We have taken a solemn oath not to touch food until we have killed Paul.
044	ACT	023	015	So we want you now, with the consent of the Council, to suggest to the commanding officer that he should bring Paul down before you, as though you intended to go more fully into his case; but, before he comes here, we will be ready to make away with him.’
044	ACT	023	016	However, the son of Paul’s sister, hearing of the plot, went to the Fort, and on being admitted, told Paul about it.
044	ACT	023	017	Paul called one of the garrison centurion and asked him to take the young man to the commanding officer, as he had something to tell him.
044	ACT	023	018	The centurion went with him to the commanding officer, and said, ‘The prisoner Paul called me and asked me to bring this young man to you, as he has something to tell you.’
044	ACT	023	019	The commanding officer took the young man by the hand, and, stepping aside, asked what it was he had to tell him.
044	ACT	023	020	‘Some men have agreed,’ he answered, ‘to ask you to bring Paul down before the Council tomorrow, on the plea of your making further inquiry into his case.
044	ACT	023	021	But do not let them persuade you, for more than forty of them are lying in wait for him, who have taken an oath that they will not eat or drink, until they have made away with him; and they are at this very moment in readiness, counting on your promise.’
044	ACT	023	022	The commanding officer then dismissed the young man, cautioning him not to mention to anybody that he had given him that information.
044	ACT	023	023	Then he called two Captains, and ordered them to have two hundred soldiers ready to go to Caesarea, as well as seventy troopers and two hundred lancers, by nine o’clock that night,
044	ACT	023	024	and to have horses ready for Paul to ride, so that they might take him safely to Felix, the Governor.
044	ACT	023	025	He also wrote a letter along these lines:
044	ACT	023	026	“Claudius Lysias sends his compliments to His Excellency Felix the Governor.
044	ACT	023	027	The man whom I send with this had been seized by some Jews, and was on the point of being killed by them, when I came upon them with the force under my command, and rescued him, as I learned that he was a Roman citizen.
044	ACT	023	028	Wanting to know exactly the ground of the charges they made against him, I brought him before their Council,
044	ACT	023	029	when I found that their charges were connected with questions of their own Law, and that there was nothing alleged involving either death or imprisonment.
044	ACT	023	030	Having, however, information of a plot against the man, which was about to be put into execution, I am sending him to you at once, and I have also directed his accusers to prosecute him before you.”
044	ACT	023	031	The soldiers, in accordance with their orders, took charge of Paul and conducted him by night to Antipatris;
044	ACT	023	032	and on the next day, leaving the troopers to go on with him, they returned to the Fort.
044	ACT	023	033	On arriving at Caesarea, the troopers delivered the letter to the Governor, and brought Paul before him.
044	ACT	023	034	As soon as Felix had read the letter, he enquired to what province Paul belonged, and, learning that he came from Cilicia, he said,
044	ACT	023	035	‘I will hear all you have to say as soon as your accusers have arrived.’ And he ordered Paul to be kept under guard in Herod’s Government house.
044	ACT	024	001	Five days afterwards the high priest Ananias came down with some of the elders and a barrister named Tertullus. They laid an information with the Governor against Paul;
044	ACT	024	002	and, when the hearing came on, Tertullus began his speech for the prosecution.
044	ACT	024	003	‘We owe it to your Excellency,’ he said, ‘that we are enjoying profound peace, and we owe it to your foresight that this nation is constantly securing reforms – advantages which we very gratefully accept at all times and places.
044	ACT	024	004	But – not to be tedious – I beg you, with your accustomed fairness, to listen to a brief statement of our case.
044	ACT	024	005	We have found this man a public pest; he is one who stirs up disputes among our people all the world over, and is a ringleader of the Nazarene heretics.
044	ACT	024	006	He even attempted to desecrate the Temple itself, but we caught him;
044	ACT	024	008	and you will be able, by examining him on all these points, to satisfy yourself as to the charges which we are bringing against him.’
044	ACT	024	009	The Jewish crowd also joined in the attack and bore out his statements.
044	ACT	024	010	On a sign from the Governor, Paul made this reply: ‘Knowing, as I do, for how many years you have acted as judge to this nation, it is with confidence that I undertake my own defence.
044	ACT	024	011	For you can easily verify that it is not more than twelve days ago that I went up to worship at Jerusalem,
044	ACT	024	012	where my prosecutors never found me holding discussions with anyone, or causing a crowd to collect – either in the Temple, or in the synagogues, or about the city;
044	ACT	024	013	and they cannot establish the charges which they are now making against me.
044	ACT	024	014	This, however, I do acknowledge to you, that it is as a believer in the Way which they call heretical, that I worship the God of my ancestors. At the same time, I believe everything that is in accordance with the Law and that is written in the prophets;
044	ACT	024	015	and I have a hope that rests in God – a hope which they also cherish – that there will one day be a resurrection of good and bad alike.
044	ACT	024	016	This being so, I strive at all times to keep my conscience clear before both God and people.
044	ACT	024	017	After some years’ absence I had come to bring charitable gifts to my nation, and to make offerings;
044	ACT	024	018	and it was while engaged in this that they found me in the Temple, after completing a period of purification, but not with any crowd or disorder.
044	ACT	024	019	There were, however, some Jews from Roman Asia who ought to have been here before you, and to have made any charge that they may have against me –
044	ACT	024	020	Or else let my opponents here say what they found wrong in me when I was before the Council,
044	ACT	024	021	except as to the one sentence that I shouted out as I stood among them – “It is about the resurrection of the dead that I am on my trial before you today”.’
044	ACT	024	022	Felix, however, adjourned the case – though he had a fairly accurate knowledge of all that concerned the Way – with the promise, ‘When Lysias, the commanding officer, comes down, I will give my decision in your case.’
044	ACT	024	023	So he gave orders to the centurion in charge of Paul to keep him in custody, but to relax the regulations, and not to prevent any of his personal friends from attending to his wants.
044	ACT	024	024	Some days later Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish, and, sending for Paul, listened to what he had to say about faith in Christ Jesus.
044	ACT	024	025	But, while Paul was speaking at length about righteousness, self-control, and the coming judgment, Felix became terrified, and interrupted him – ‘Go for the present, but, when I find an opportunity, I will send for you again.’
044	ACT	024	026	He was hoping, too, for a bribe from Paul, and so he used to send for him frequently and talk with him.
044	ACT	024	027	But, after the lapse of two years, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus; and, wishing to gain popularity with the Jewish leaders, he left Paul a prisoner.
044	ACT	025	001	Three days after Festus had arrived in his province, he left Caesarea and went up to Jerusalem.
044	ACT	025	002	There the chief priests and the leading men among the Jews laid an information before him against Paul,
044	ACT	025	003	and asked a favour of him, to Paul’s injury – to have Paul brought to Jerusalem. All the while they were plotting to make away with him on the road.
044	ACT	025	004	But Festus answered that Paul was in prison at Caesarea, and that he himself would be leaving for that place shortly.
044	ACT	025	005	‘So let the influential men among you,’ he said, ‘go down with me, and if there is anything amiss in the man, charge him formally with it.’
044	ACT	025	006	After staying among them some eight or ten days, Festus went down to Caesarea. The next day he took his seat on the Bench, and ordered Paul to be brought before him.
044	ACT	025	007	On Paul’s appearance, the Jewish leaders who had come down from Jerusalem surrounded him, and made many serious charges, which they failed to establish.
044	ACT	025	008	Paul’s answer to the charge was – “I have not committed any offence against the Jewish Law, or the Temple, or the Emperor.”
044	ACT	025	009	But, as Festus wished to gain popularity with the Jews, he interrupted Paul with the question, ‘Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem and be tried on these charges before me there?’
044	ACT	025	010	‘No,’ replied Paul, ‘I am standing at the Emperor’s court, where I ought to be tried. I have not wronged the Jews, as you yourself are well aware.
044	ACT	025	011	If, however, I am breaking the law and have committed any offence deserving death, I do not ask to escape the penalty; but, if there is nothing in the accusations of these people, no one has the power to give me up to them. I appeal to the Emperor.’
044	ACT	025	012	Festus, after conferring with his Council, answered, ‘You have appealed to the Emperor; to the Emperor you will go.’
044	ACT	025	013	Some days later King Agrippa and Bernice came down to Caesarea, and paid a visit of congratulation to Festus;
044	ACT	025	014	and, as they were staying there for several days, Festus laid Paul’s case before the king. ‘There is a man here,’ he said, ‘left a prisoner by Felix,
044	ACT	025	015	about whom, when I came to Jerusalem, the Jewish chief priest and the elders laid an information, demanding judgment against him.
044	ACT	025	016	My answer to them was, that it was not the practice of Romans to give up anyone to their accusers until the accused had met them face to face, and had also had an opportunity of answering the charges brought against them.
044	ACT	025	017	So they met here, and without loss of time I took my seat on the Bench the very next day, and ordered the man to be brought before me.
044	ACT	025	018	But, when his accusers came forward, they brought no charge of wrongdoing such as I had expected;
044	ACT	025	019	but I found that there were certain questions in dispute between them about their own religion, and about some dead man called Jesus, whom Paul declared to be alive.
044	ACT	025	020	And, as I was at a loss how to enquire into questions of this kind, I asked Paul if he were willing to go up to Jerusalem, and be put on trial there.
044	ACT	025	021	Paul, however, appealed to have his case reserved for the consideration of his August Majesty, so I ordered him to be detained in custody, until I could send him to the Emperor.’
044	ACT	025	022	‘I should like to hear this man myself,’ Agrippa said to Festus. ‘You will hear him tomorrow,’ Festus answered.
044	ACT	025	023	So the next day, when Agrippa and Bernice had come in full state and had entered the Audience Chamber, with the superior officers and the principal people of the city, by the order of Festus Paul was brought before them.
044	ACT	025	024	Then Festus said, ‘King Agrippa, and all here present, you see before you the man about whom the whole Jewish people have applied to me, both at Jerusalem and here, loudly asserting that he ought not to be allowed to live.
044	ACT	025	025	I found, however, that he had not done anything deserving death; so, as he had himself appealed to his August Majesty, I decided to send him.
044	ACT	025	026	But I have nothing definite to write about him to my Imperial Master; and for that reason I have brought him before you all, and especially before you, King Agrippa, that, after examining him, I may have something to write.
044	ACT	025	027	For it seems to me absurd to send a prisoner, without at the same time stating the charges made against him.’
044	ACT	026	001	Turning to Paul, Agrippa said, ‘You are at liberty to speak for yourself.’ Then Paul stretched out his hand and began his defence.
044	ACT	026	002	‘I have been congratulating myself, King Agrippa,’ he said, ‘that it is before you that I have to make my defence today, with regard to all the charges brought against me by my own people,
044	ACT	026	003	especially as you are so well-versed in all the customs and questions of the Jewish world. I beg you therefore to give me a patient hearing.
044	ACT	026	004	My life, then, from youth upwards, was passed, from the very first, among my own nation, and in Jerusalem, and is within the knowledge of all Jews;
044	ACT	026	005	and they have always known – if they choose to give evidence – that, in accordance with the very strictest form of our religion, I lived a true Pharisee.
044	ACT	026	006	Even now, it is because of my hope in the promise given by God to our ancestors that I stand here on my trial –
044	ACT	026	007	A promise which our twelve tribes, by earnest service night and day, hope to see fulfilled. It is for this hope, your Majesty, that I am accused – and by Jews themselves!
044	ACT	026	008	Why do you all hold it incredible that God should raise the dead?
044	ACT	026	009	I myself, it is true, once thought it my duty to oppose in every way the name of Jesus of Nazareth;
044	ACT	026	010	and I actually did so at Jerusalem. Acting on the authority of the chief priests, I myself threw many of the people of Christ into prison, and, when it was proposed to put them to death, I gave my vote for it.
044	ACT	026	011	Time after time, in every synagogue, I tried by punishments to force them to blaspheme. So frantic was I against them, that I pursued them even to towns beyond our borders.
044	ACT	026	012	It was while I was traveling to Damascus on an errand of this kind, entrusted with full powers by the chief priests,
044	ACT	026	013	that at midday, your Majesty, I saw right in my path, coming from the heavens, a light brighter than the glare of the sun, which shone all round me and those traveling with me.
044	ACT	026	014	We all fell to the ground, and then I heard a voice saying to me in Hebrew – “Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? By kicking against the goad you are punishing yourself.”
044	ACT	026	015	“Who are you, Lord?” I asked. And the Lord said, “I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting;
044	ACT	026	016	but get up and stand upright; for I have appeared to you in order to appoint you a servant and a witness of those revelations of me which you have already had, and of those in which I will yet appear to you,
044	ACT	026	017	since I am choosing you out from your own people and from the Gentiles, to whom I now send you,
044	ACT	026	018	to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God; so that they may receive pardon for their sins, and a place among those who have become God’s people, by faith in me.”
044	ACT	026	019	After that, King Agrippa, I did not fail to obey the heavenly vision;
044	ACT	026	020	on the contrary, first to those at Damascus and Jerusalem, and then through the whole of Judea, and to the Gentiles as well, I began to preach repentance and conversion to God, and a life befitting that repentance.
044	ACT	026	021	This is why some men seized me in the Temple, and made attempts on my life.
044	ACT	026	022	However I have received help from God to this very day, and so stand here, and bear my testimony to high and low alike – without adding a word to what the prophets, as well as Moses, declared should happen –
044	ACT	026	023	That the Christ must suffer, and that, by rising from the dead, he was destined to be the first to bring news of light, not only to our nation, but also to the Gentiles.’
044	ACT	026	024	While Paul was making this defence, Festus called out loudly, ‘You are mad, Paul; your great learning is driving you mad.’
044	ACT	026	025	‘I am not mad, your Excellency,’ he replied. ‘On the contrary, the statements that I am making are true and sober.
044	ACT	026	026	Indeed, the king knows about these matters, so I speak before him without constraint. I am sure that there is nothing whatever of what I have been telling him that has escaped his attention; for all this has not been done in a corner.
044	ACT	026	027	King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know you do.’
044	ACT	026	028	But Agrippa said to Paul, ‘You are soon trying to make a Christian of me!’
044	ACT	026	029	‘Whether it is soon or late,’ answered Paul, ‘I pray to God that not only you, but all who are listening to me, might today become just what I am myself – except for these chains!’
044	ACT	026	030	Then the king rose, with the Governor and Bernice and those who had been sitting with them,
044	ACT	026	031	and, after retiring, discussed the case among themselves. ‘There is nothing,’ they said, ‘deserving death or imprisonment in this man’s conduct’;
044	ACT	026	032	and, speaking to Festus, Agrippa added, ‘The man might have been discharged, if he had not appealed to the Emperor.’
044	ACT	027	001	As it was decided that we were to sail to Italy, Paul and some other prisoners were put in charge of a centurion of the Augustan Guard, named Julius.
044	ACT	027	002	We went on board a ship from Adramyttium, which was on the point of sailing to the ports along the coast of Roman Asia, and put to sea. Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica, went with us.
044	ACT	027	003	The next day we put in to Sidon, where Julius treated Paul in a friendly manner, and allowed him to go to see his friends and receive their hospitality.
044	ACT	027	004	Putting to sea again, we sailed under the lee of Cyprus, because the wind was against us;
044	ACT	027	005	and, after crossing the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we reached Myra in Lycia.
044	ACT	027	006	There the Roman officer found an Alexandrian ship on her way to Italy, and put us on board of her.
044	ACT	027	007	For several days our progress was slow, and it was only with difficulty that we arrived off Cnidus. As the wind was still unfavourable when we came off Cape Salmone, we sailed under the lee of Crete,
044	ACT	027	008	and with difficulty, by keeping close in shore, we reached a place called “Fair Havens,” near which was the town of Lasea.
044	ACT	027	009	This had taken a considerable time, and sailing was already dangerous, for the Fast was already over; and so Paul gave this warning.
044	ACT	027	010	‘My friends,’ he said, ‘I see that this voyage will be attended with injury and much damage, not only to the cargo and the ship, but to our own lives also.’
044	ACT	027	011	The Roman officer, however, was more influenced by the captain and the owner than by what was said by Paul.
044	ACT	027	012	And, as the harbour was not a suitable one to winter in, the majority were in favour of continuing the voyage, in hope of being able to reach Phoenix, and winter there. Phoenix was a Cretan harbour, open to the north-east and south-east.
044	ACT	027	013	So, when a light wind sprang up from the south, thinking that they had found their opportunity, they weighed anchor and kept along the coast of Crete, close in shore.
044	ACT	027	014	But shortly afterwards a hurricane came down on us off the land – a north-easter, as it is called.
044	ACT	027	015	The ship was caught by it and was unable to keep her head to the wind, so we had to give way and let her drive before it.
044	ACT	027	016	Running under the lee of a small island called Cauda, we only just managed to secure the ship’s boat,
044	ACT	027	017	and, after hoisting it on board, the men frapped the ship. But, afraid of being driven on to the Syrtis Sands, they lowered the yard, and then drifted.
044	ACT	027	018	So violently were we tossed about by the storm, that the next day they began throwing the cargo overboard,
044	ACT	027	019	and, on the following day, threw out the ship’s tackle with their own hands.
044	ACT	027	020	As neither sun nor stars were visible for several days, and, as the gale still continued severe, all hope of our being saved was at last abandoned.
044	ACT	027	021	It was then, when they had gone a long time without food, that Paul came forward, and said, ‘My friends, you should have listened to me, and not have sailed from Crete and so incurred this injury and damage.
044	ACT	027	022	Yet, even as things are, I beg you not to lose courage, for there will not be a single life lost among you – only the ship.
044	ACT	027	023	For last night an angel of the God to whom I belong, and whom I serve, stood by me, and said –
044	ACT	027	024	“Have no fear, Paul; you must appear before the Emperor, and God himself has given you the lives of all your fellow voyagers.”
044	ACT	027	025	Therefore, courage, my friends! For I believe God, that everything will happen exactly as I have been told.
044	ACT	027	026	We will, however, have to be driven on some island.’
044	ACT	027	027	It was now the fourteenth night of the storm, and we were drifting about in the Adriatic Sea, when, about midnight, the sailors began to suspect that they were drawing near land.
044	ACT	027	028	So they took soundings, and found twenty fathoms of water. After waiting a little, they took soundings again, and found fifteen fathoms.
044	ACT	027	029	Then, as they were afraid of our being driven on some rocky coast, they let go four anchors from the stern, and longed for daylight.
044	ACT	027	030	The sailors wanted to leave the ship, and had lowered the boat, on pretence of running out anchors from the bows,
044	ACT	027	031	when Paul said to the Roman officer and his men, ‘Unless the sailors remain on board, you cannot be saved.’
044	ACT	027	032	So the soldiers cut the ropes which held the boat, and let her drift away.
044	ACT	027	033	In the interval before daybreak Paul kept urging them all to take something to eat. ‘It is a fortnight today,’ he said, ‘that, owing to your anxiety, you have gone without food, taking nothing.
044	ACT	027	034	So I beg you to take something to eat; your safety depends on it, for not one of you will lose even a hair of his head.’
044	ACT	027	035	With these words he took some bread, and, after saying the thanksgiving to God before them all, broke it in pieces, and began to eat;
044	ACT	027	036	and the men all felt cheered and had something to eat themselves.
044	ACT	027	037	There were about seventy-six of us on board, all told.
044	ACT	027	038	After satisfying their hunger, they further lightened the ship by throwing the grain into the sea.
044	ACT	027	039	When daylight came, they could not make out what land it was, but, observing a creek in which there was a beach, they consulted as to whether they could run the ship safely into it.
044	ACT	027	040	Then they cast off, and abandoned the anchors, and at the same time unlashed the gear of the steering oars, hoisted the foresail to the wind, and made for the beach.
044	ACT	027	041	They got, however, into a kind of channel, and there ran the ship aground. The bows stuck fast and could not be moved, while the stern began breaking up under the strain.
044	ACT	027	042	The advice of the soldiers was that the prisoners should be killed, so that none of them could swim away and make their escape.
044	ACT	027	043	But the Roman officer, anxious to save Paul, prevented their carrying out their intention, and ordered that those who could swim should be the first to jump into the sea and try to reach the shore;
044	ACT	027	044	and that the rest should follow, some on planks, and others on different pieces of the ship. In these various ways everyone managed to get safely ashore.
044	ACT	028	001	When we were all safe, we found that the island was called Malta.
044	ACT	028	002	The island’s people showed us marked kindness, for they lit a fire and took us all under shelter, because it had come on to rain and was cold.
044	ACT	028	003	Paul had gathered a quantity of dry sticks and laid them on the fire, when a poisonous snake, driven out by the heat, fastened on his hand.
044	ACT	028	004	When the islanders saw the creature hanging from his hand, they said to one another, ‘Evidently this man is a murderer, for though he has been saved from the sea, Justice has not allowed him to live.’
044	ACT	028	005	However, Paul shook the creature off into the fire and took no harm.
044	ACT	028	006	The islanders were expecting inflammation to set in, or that he would suddenly fall dead; but, after waiting for a long time, and seeing that there was nothing amiss with him, they changed their minds and said that he was a God.
044	ACT	028	007	In that region there was an estate belonging to the Governor of the island, whose name was Publius. He took us up to his house, and for three days entertained us most courteously.
044	ACT	028	008	It happened that the father of Publius was lying ill of fever and dysentery. So Paul went to see him; and, after praying, he placed his hands on him and cured him.
044	ACT	028	009	After this, all the people in the island who had any illness came to Paul, and were cured.
044	ACT	028	010	They also presented us with many gifts, and when we set sail they put supplies of necessaries on board.
044	ACT	028	011	After three months, we set sail in a ship that had wintered in the island. She was an Alexandrian vessel, and had the Twin sons of Zeus for her figure-head.
044	ACT	028	012	We put in at Syracuse and stayed there three days,
044	ACT	028	013	and from there we worked to windward and so got to Rhegium. A day later a south wind sprang up and took us to Puteoli in two days.
044	ACT	028	014	There we found some of the Lord’s followers, and were urged to stay a week with them; after which we went on to Rome.
044	ACT	028	015	The followers there had heard about us, and came out as far as the Market of Appius and the Three Taverns to meet us. At sight of them Paul thanked God and was much cheered.
044	ACT	028	016	On our reaching Rome, Paul was allowed to live by himself, except for the soldier who was in charge of him.
044	ACT	028	017	Three days after our arrival, Paul invited the leading Jews to meet him; and, when they came, he said, ‘Brothers, although I had done nothing hostile to the interests of our nation or to our ancestral customs, yet I was sent from Jerusalem as a prisoner, and handed over to the Romans.
044	ACT	028	018	The Romans, when they had examined me, were ready to release me, because there was nothing in my conduct deserving death.
044	ACT	028	019	But, as the Jewish leaders opposed my release, I was compelled to appeal to the Emperor – not, indeed, that I had any charge to make against my own nation.
044	ACT	028	020	This, then, is my reason for urging you to come to see me and talk with me; because it is for the sake of the hope of Israel that I am here in chains.’
044	ACT	028	021	‘We,’ was their reply, ‘have not had any letter about you from Judea, nor have any of our fellow Jews come and reported or said anything bad about you.
044	ACT	028	022	But we will be glad to hear from you what your views are, for, with regard to this sect, we are well aware that it is spoken against on all sides.’
044	ACT	028	023	They then fixed a day with him, and came to the place where he was staying, in even larger numbers, when Paul proceeded to lay the subject before them. He bore his testimony to the kingdom of God, and tried to convince them about Jesus, by arguments drawn from the Law of Moses and from the prophets – speaking from morning until evening.
044	ACT	028	024	Some were inclined to accept what he said; others, however, rejected it.
044	ACT	028	025	So, as they disagreed among themselves, they began to disperse, Paul adding only – ‘True, indeed, was the declaration made by the Holy Spirit, through the prophet Isaiah to your ancestors –
044	ACT	028	026	Go to this nation and say: You will hear with your ears without ever understanding, and, though you have eyes, you will see without ever perceiving.
044	ACT	028	027	For the mind of this nation has grown dense, and their ears are dull of hearing, their eyes also have they closed; otherwise some day they might see with their eyes, and with their ears they might hear, and in their mind they might understand, and might turn – and I might heal them.
044	ACT	028	028	Understand, then, that this salvation of God was sent for the Gentiles; and they will listen.’
044	ACT	028	030	For two whole years Paul stayed in a house which he rented for himself, welcoming all who came to see him,
044	ACT	028	031	proclaiming the kingdom of God, and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ, with perfect fearlessness, unhindered.

# BOOK	045	ROM	Romans	Romans
045	ROM	001	001	From Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, who has been called to become an apostle, and has been set apart to tell God’s good news.
045	ROM	001	002	This good news God promised long ago through his prophets in the sacred scriptures,
045	ROM	001	003	concerning his Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord; who, as to his human nature, was descended from David,
045	ROM	001	004	but, as to the spirit of holiness within him, was miraculously designated Son of God by his resurrection from the dead.
045	ROM	001	005	Through him we received the gift of the apostolic office, to win submission to the faith among all nations for the glory of his name.
045	ROM	001	006	And among these nations are you – you who have been called to belong to Jesus Christ.
045	ROM	001	007	To all in Rome who are dear to God and have been called to become Christ’s people, may God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you and give you peace.
045	ROM	001	008	First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, because the report of your faith is spreading throughout the world.
045	ROM	001	009	God, to whom I offer the worship of my soul as I tell the goodness of his Son, is my witness how constantly I mention you when I pray,
045	ROM	001	010	asking that, if he be willing, I may some day at last find the way open to visit you.
045	ROM	001	011	For I long to see you, in order to impart to you some spiritual gift and so give you fresh strength –
045	ROM	001	012	or rather that both you and I may find encouragement in each other’s faith.
045	ROM	001	013	I want you to know, my friends, that I have many times intended coming to see you – but until now I have been prevented – that I might find among you some fruit of my labours, as I have already among the other nations.
045	ROM	001	014	I have a duty to both the Greek and the barbarian, to both the cultured and the ignorant.
045	ROM	001	015	And so, for my part, I am ready to tell the good news to you also who are in Rome.
045	ROM	001	016	For I am not ashamed of the good news; it is the power of God which brings salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first, but also to the Greek.
045	ROM	001	017	For in it there is a revelation of the divine righteousness resulting from faith and leading on to faith; as scripture says – “Through faith the righteous will find life.”
045	ROM	001	018	So, too, there is a revelation from heaven of the divine wrath against every form of ungodliness and wickedness on the part of those people who, by their wicked lives, are stifling the truth.
045	ROM	001	019	This is so, because what can be known about God is plain to them; for God himself has made it plain.
045	ROM	001	020	For ever since the creation of the universe God’s invisible attributes – his everlasting power and divinity – are to be seen and studied in his works, so that people have no excuse;
045	ROM	001	021	because, although they learned to know God, yet they did not offer him as God either praise or thanksgiving. Their speculations about him proved futile, and their undiscerning minds were darkened.
045	ROM	001	022	Professing to be wise, they showed themselves fools;
045	ROM	001	023	and they transformed the glory of the immortal God into the likeness of mortal humans, and of birds, and beasts, and reptiles.
045	ROM	001	024	Therefore God abandoned them to impurity, letting them follow the cravings of their hearts, until they dishonoured their own bodies;
045	ROM	001	025	for they had substituted a lie for the truth about God, and had reverenced and worshiped created things more than the Creator, who is to be praised for ever. Amen.
045	ROM	001	026	That, I say, is why God abandoned them to degrading passions. Even the women among them perverted the natural use of their bodies to the unnatural;
045	ROM	001	027	while the men, disregarding that for which women were intended by nature, were consumed with passion for one another. Men indulged in vile practices with men, and incurred in their own persons the inevitable penalty for their perverseness.
045	ROM	001	028	Then, as they would not keep God before their minds, God abandoned them to depraved thoughts, so that they did all kinds of shameful things.
045	ROM	001	029	They revelled in every form of wickedness, evil, greed, vice. Their lives were full of envy, murder, quarrelling, treachery, malice.
045	ROM	001	030	They became back-biters, slanderers, impious, insolent, boastful. They devised new sins. They disobeyed their parents.
045	ROM	001	031	They were undiscerning, untrustworthy, without natural affection or pity.
045	ROM	001	032	Well aware of God’s decree, that those who do such things deserve to die, not only are they guilty of them themselves, but they even applaud those who do them.
045	ROM	002	001	Therefore you have nothing to say in your own defence, whoever you are who set yourself up as a judge. In judging others you condemn yourself, for you who set yourself up as a judge do the very same things.
045	ROM	002	002	And we know that God’s judgment falls unerringly on those who do them.
045	ROM	002	003	You who judge those that do such things and yet are yourself guilty of them – do you suppose that you of all people will escape God’s judgment?
045	ROM	002	004	Or do you think lightly of his abundant kindness, patience, and forbearance, not realising that his kindness is meant to lead you to repentance?
045	ROM	002	005	Hard-hearted and impenitent as you are, you are storing up for yourself wrath on the day of wrath, when God’s justice as a judge will be revealed;
045	ROM	002	006	for he will give to everyone what their actions deserve.
045	ROM	002	007	To those who, by perseverance in doing good, aim at glory, honour, and all that is imperishable, he will give immortal life;
045	ROM	002	008	while as to those who are factious, and disobedient to truth but obedient to evil, wrath and anger, distress and despair,
045	ROM	002	009	will fall on every human being who persists in wrongdoing – on the Jew first, but also on the Greek.
045	ROM	002	010	But there will be glory, honour, and peace for everyone who does right – for the Jew first, but also for the Greek,
045	ROM	002	011	since God shows no partiality.
045	ROM	002	012	All who, when they sin, are without Law will also perish without Law; while all who, when they sin, are under Law, will be judged as being under Law.
045	ROM	002	013	It is not those who hear the words of a Law that are righteous before God, but it is those who obey it that will be pronounced righteous.
045	ROM	002	014	When Gentiles, who have no Law, do instinctively what the Law requires, they, though they have no Law, are a Law to themselves;
045	ROM	002	015	for they show the demands of the Law written on their hearts; their consciences corroborating it, while in their thoughts they argue either in self-accusation or, it may be, in self-defence –
045	ROM	002	016	on the day when God passes judgment on people’s inmost lives, as the good news that I tell declares that he will do through Christ Jesus.
045	ROM	002	017	But, perhaps, you bear the name of “Jew,” and are relying on Law, and boast of belonging to God, and understand his will,
045	ROM	002	018	and, having been carefully instructed from the Law, have learned to appreciate the finer moral distinctions.
045	ROM	002	019	Perhaps you are confident that you are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in the dark, an instructor of the unintelligent,
045	ROM	002	020	and a teacher of the childish, because in the Law you possess the outline of all knowledge and truth.
045	ROM	002	021	Why, then, you teacher of others, don’t you teach yourself? Do you preach against stealing, and yet steal?
045	ROM	002	022	Do you forbid adultery, and yet commit adultery? Do you loathe idols, and yet plunder temples?
045	ROM	002	023	Boasting, as you do, of your Law, do you dishonour God by breaking the Law?
045	ROM	002	024	For, as scripture says – “The Gentiles insult God’s name because of you”!
045	ROM	002	025	Circumcision has its value, if you are obeying the Law. But, if you are a breaker of the Law, your circumcision is no better than uncircumcision.
045	ROM	002	026	If, then, an uncircumcised man pays regard to the requirements of the Law, won’t he, although not circumcised, be regarded by God as if he were?
045	ROM	002	027	Indeed, the person who, owing to his birth, remains uncircumcised, and yet scrupulously obeys the Law, will condemn you, who, for all your written Law and your circumcision, are yet a breaker of the Law.
045	ROM	002	028	For a man who is only a Jew outwardly is not a real Jew; nor is outward bodily circumcision real circumcision. The real Jew is the person who is a Jew in soul;
045	ROM	002	029	and the real circumcision is the circumcision of the heart, a spiritual and not a literal thing. Such a person wins praise from God, though not from people.
045	ROM	003	001	What is the advantage, then, of being a Jew? Or what is the good of circumcision?
045	ROM	003	002	Great in every way. First of all, because the Jews were entrusted with God’s utterances.
045	ROM	003	003	What follows then? Some, no doubt, showed a want of faith; but will their want of faith make God break faith? Heaven forbid!
045	ROM	003	004	God must prove true, though everyone prove a liar! As scripture says of God – “That you may be pronounced righteous in what you say, and gain your cause when people would judge you.”
045	ROM	003	005	But what if our wrongdoing makes God’s righteousness all the clearer? Will God be wrong in inflicting punishment? (I can but speak as a person.) Heaven forbid!
045	ROM	003	006	Otherwise how can God judge the world?
045	ROM	003	007	But, if my falsehood redounds to the glory of God, by making his truthfulness more apparent, why am I like others, still condemned as a sinner?
045	ROM	003	008	Why should we not say – as some people slanderously assert that we do say – “Let us do evil that good may come”? The condemnation of such people is indeed just!
045	ROM	003	009	What follows, then? Are we Jews in any way superior to others? Not at all. Our indictment against both Jews and Greeks was that all alike were in subjection to sin.
045	ROM	003	010	As scripture says – “There is not even one who is righteous,
045	ROM	003	011	not one who understands, not one who is searching for God!
045	ROM	003	012	They have all gone astray; they have one and all become depraved; there is no one who is doing good – no, not one!”
045	ROM	003	013	“Their throats are like opened graves; they deceive with their tongues.” “The venom of snakes lies behind their lips,”
045	ROM	003	014	“And their mouths are full of bitter curses.”
045	ROM	003	015	“Swift are their feet to shed blood.
045	ROM	003	016	Distress and trouble dog their steps,
045	ROM	003	017	and the path of peace they do not know.”
045	ROM	003	018	“The fear of God is not before their eyes.”
045	ROM	003	019	Now we know that everything said in the Law is addressed to those who are under its authority, in order that every mouth may be closed, and to bring the whole world under God’s judgment.
045	ROM	003	020	For no human being will be pronounced righteous before God as the result of obedience to Law; for it is Law that shows what sin is.
045	ROM	003	021	But now, quite apart from Law, the divine righteousness stands revealed, and to it the Law and the prophets bear witness –
045	ROM	003	022	the divine righteousness which is bestowed, through faith in Jesus Christ, on all, without distinction, who believe in him.
045	ROM	003	023	For all have sinned, and all fall short of God’s glorious ideal,
045	ROM	003	024	but, in his loving kindness, are being freely pronounced righteous through the deliverance found in Christ Jesus.
045	ROM	003	025	For God set him before the world, to be, by the shedding of his blood, a means of reconciliation through faith. And this God did to prove his righteousness, and because, in his forbearance, he had passed over the sins that people had previously committed;
045	ROM	003	026	as a proof, I repeat, at the present time, of his own righteousness, that he might be righteous in our eyes, and might pronounce righteous the person who takes their stand on faith in Jesus.
045	ROM	003	027	What, then, becomes of our boasting? It is excluded. By what sort of Law? A Law requiring obedience? No, a Law requiring faith.
045	ROM	003	028	For we conclude that a person is pronounced righteous on the ground of faith, quite apart from obedience to Law.
045	ROM	003	029	Or can it be that God is the God only of the Jews? Isn’t he also the God of the Gentiles?
045	ROM	003	030	Yes, of the Gentiles also, since there is only one God, and he will pronounce those who are circumcised righteous as the result of faith, and also those who are uncircumcised on their showing the same faith.
045	ROM	003	031	Do we, then, use this faith to abolish Law? Heaven forbid! No, we establish Law.
045	ROM	004	001	What then, it may be asked, are we to say about Abraham, the ancestor of our nation?
045	ROM	004	002	If he was pronounced righteous as the result of obedience, then he has something to boast of. Yes, but not before God.
045	ROM	004	003	For what are the words of scripture? “Abraham had faith in God, and his faith was regarded by God as righteousness.”
045	ROM	004	004	Now wages are regarded as due to the person who works, not as a favour, but as a debt;
045	ROM	004	005	while, as for the person who does not rely on their obedience, but has faith in him who can pronounce the godless righteous, their faith is regarded by God as righteousness.
045	ROM	004	006	In precisely the same way David speaks of the blessing pronounced on the person who is regarded by God as righteous apart from actions –
045	ROM	004	007	“Blessed are those whose wrongdoings have been forgiven and over whose sins a veil has been drawn!
045	ROM	004	008	Blessed the man whom the Lord will never regard as sinful!”
045	ROM	004	009	Is this blessing, then, pronounced on the circumcised only or on the uncircumcised as well? We say that – “Abraham’s faith was regarded by God as righteousness.”
045	ROM	004	010	Under what circumstances, then, did this take place? After his circumcision or before it?
045	ROM	004	011	Not after, but before. And it was as a sign of this that he received the rite of circumcision – to show the righteousness due to the faith of an uncircumcised man – in order that he might be the father of all who have faith in God even when uncircumcised, so that they also may be regarded by God as righteous;
045	ROM	004	012	as well as father of the circumcised – to those who are not only circumcised, but who also follow our father Abraham in that faith which he had while still uncircumcised.
045	ROM	004	013	For the promise that he should inherit the world did not come to Abraham or his descendants through Law, but through the righteousness due to faith.
045	ROM	004	014	If those who take their stand on Law are to inherit the world, then faith is robbed of its meaning and the promise comes to nothing!
045	ROM	004	015	Law entails punishment; but, where no Law exists, no breach of it is possible.
045	ROM	004	016	That is why everything is made to depend on faith: so that everything may be God’s gift, and in order that the fulfilment of the promise may be made certain for all Abraham’s descendants – not only for those who take their stand on the Law, but also for those who take their stand on the faith of Abraham. (He is the father of us all;
045	ROM	004	017	as scripture says – “I have made you the father of many nations.”) And this they do in the sight of that God in whom Abraham had faith, and who gives life to the dead, and speaks of what does not yet exist as if it did.
045	ROM	004	018	With no ground for hope, Abraham, sustained by hope, put faith in God; in order that, in fulfilment of the words – “So many will your descendants be,” he might become “the father of many nations.”
045	ROM	004	019	Though he was nearly a hundred years old, yet his faith did not fail him, even when he thought of his own body, then utterly worn out, and remembered that Sarah was past bearing children.
045	ROM	004	020	He was not led by want of faith to doubt God’s promise.
045	ROM	004	021	On the contrary, his faith gave him strength; and he praised God, in the firm conviction that what God has promised he is also able to carry out.
045	ROM	004	022	And therefore his faith “was regarded as righteousness.”
045	ROM	004	023	Now these words – “it was regarded as righteousness” – were not written with reference to Abraham only;
045	ROM	004	024	but also with reference to us. Our faith, too, will be regarded by God in the same light, if we have faith in him who raised Jesus, our Lord, from the dead;
045	ROM	004	025	for Jesus was given up to death to atone for our offences, and was raised to life that we might be pronounced righteous.
045	ROM	005	001	Therefore, having been pronounced righteous as the result of faith, let us enjoy peace with God through Jesus Christ, our Lord.
045	ROM	005	002	It is through him that, by reason of our faith, we have obtained admission to that place in God’s favour in which we now stand. So let us exult in our hope of attaining God’s glorious ideal.
045	ROM	005	003	And not only that, but let us also exult in our troubles;
045	ROM	005	004	for we know that trouble develops endurance, and endurance strength of character, and strength of character hope,
045	ROM	005	005	and that hope never disappoints. For the love of God has filled our hearts through the Holy Spirit which was given us;
045	ROM	005	006	seeing that, while we were still powerless, Christ, in God’s good time, died on behalf of the godless.
045	ROM	005	007	Even for an upright person scarcely anyone will die. For a really good person perhaps someone might even dare to die.
045	ROM	005	008	But God puts his love for us beyond all doubt by the fact that Christ died on our behalf while we were still sinners.
045	ROM	005	009	Much more, then, now that we have been pronounced righteous by virtue of the shedding of his blood, will we be saved through him from the wrath of God.
045	ROM	005	010	For if, when we were God’s enemies, we were reconciled to him through the death of his Son, much more, now that we have become reconciled, will we be saved by virtue of Christ’s life.
045	ROM	005	011	And not only that, but we exult in God, through Jesus Christ, our Lord, through whom we have now obtained this reconciliation.
045	ROM	005	012	Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and through sin came death; so, also, death spread to all humanity, because every person has sinned.
045	ROM	005	013	Even before the time of the Law there was sin in the world; but sin cannot be charged against someone where no Law exists.
045	ROM	005	014	Yet, from Adam to Moses, death reigned even over those whose sin was not a breach of a law, as Adam’s was. And Adam foreshadows the one to come.
045	ROM	005	015	But there is a contrast between Adam’s offence and God’s gracious gift. For, if by reason of the offence of the one man the whole human race died, far more were the loving kindness of God, and the gift given in the loving kindness of the one man, Jesus Christ, lavished on the whole human race.
045	ROM	005	016	There is a contrast, too, between the gift and the results of the one man’s sin. The judgment, which followed on the one man’s sin, resulted in condemnation, but God’s gracious gift, which followed on many offences, resulted in a decree of righteousness.
045	ROM	005	017	For if, by reason of the offence of the one man, death reigned through that one man, far more will those, on whom God’s loving kindness and his gift of righteousness are lavished, find life, and reign through the one man, Jesus Christ.
045	ROM	005	018	Briefly then, just as a single offence resulted for all humanity in condemnation, so, too, a single decree of righteousness resulted for all humanity in that declaration of righteousness which brings life.
045	ROM	005	019	For, as through the disobedience of the one man the whole human race was rendered sinful, so, too, through the obedience of the one, the whole human race will be rendered righteous.
045	ROM	005	020	Law was introduced in order that offences might be multiplied. But, where sins were multiplied, the loving kindness of God was lavished the more,
045	ROM	005	021	in order that, just as sin had reigned in the realm of death, so, too, might loving-kindness reign through righteousness, and result in eternal life, through Jesus Christ, our Lord.
045	ROM	006	001	What are we to say, then? Are we to continue to sin, in order that God’s loving kindness may be multiplied?
045	ROM	006	002	Heaven forbid! We became dead to sin, so how can we go on living in it?
045	ROM	006	003	Or can it be that you do not know that all of us, who were baptised into union with Christ Jesus, in our baptism shared his death?
045	ROM	006	004	Consequently, through sharing his death in our baptism, we were buried with him; so that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by a manifestation of the Father’s power, so we also may live a new life.
045	ROM	006	005	If we have become united with him by the act symbolic of his death, surely we will also become united with him by the act symbolic of his resurrection.
045	ROM	006	006	We recognise the truth that our old self was crucified with Christ, in order that the body, the stronghold of sin, might be rendered powerless, so that we should no longer be slaves to sin.
045	ROM	006	007	For the man who has so died has been pronounced righteous and released from sin.
045	ROM	006	008	And our belief is, that, as we have shared Christ’s death, we will also share his life.
045	ROM	006	009	We know, indeed, that Christ, having once risen from the dead, will not die again. Death has power over him no longer.
045	ROM	006	010	For the death that he died was a death to sin, once and for all. But the life that he now lives, he lives for God.
045	ROM	006	011	So let it be with you – regard yourselves as dead to sin, but as living for God, through union with Christ Jesus.
045	ROM	006	012	Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal bodies and compel you to obey its cravings.
045	ROM	006	013	Do not offer any part of your bodies to sin, in the cause of unrighteousness, but once for all offer yourselves to God (as those who, though once dead, now have life), and devote every part of your bodies to the cause of righteousness.
045	ROM	006	014	For sin will not lord it over you. You are living under the reign, not of Law, but of love.
045	ROM	006	015	What follows, then? Are we to sin because we are living under the reign of love and not of Law? Heaven forbid!
045	ROM	006	016	Surely you know that when you offer yourselves as servants, to obey anyone, you are the servants of the person whom you obey, whether the service be a service to sin which leads to death, or a service to duty which leads to righteousness.
045	ROM	006	017	God be thanked that, though you were once servants of sin, yet you learned to give hearty obedience to that form of doctrine under which you were placed.
045	ROM	006	018	Set free from the control of sin, you became servants to righteousness.
045	ROM	006	019	I can but speak as people do because of the weakness of your earthly nature. Once you offered every part of your bodies to the service of impurity, and of wickedness, which leads to further wickedness. Now, in the same way, offer them to the service of righteousness, which leads to holiness.
045	ROM	006	020	While you were still servants of sin, you were free as regards righteousness.
045	ROM	006	021	But what were the fruits that you reaped from those things of which you are now ashamed? For the end of such things is death.
045	ROM	006	022	But now that you have been set free from the control of sin, and have become servants to God, the fruit that you reap is an ever increasing holiness, and the end eternal life.
045	ROM	006	023	The wages of sin are death, but the gift of God is eternal life, through union with Christ Jesus, our Lord.
045	ROM	007	001	Surely, friends, you know (for I am speaking to people who know what Law means) that Law has power over a person only as long as they lives.
045	ROM	007	002	For example, by law a married woman is bound to her husband while he is living; but, if her husband dies, she is set free from the law that bound her to him.
045	ROM	007	003	If, then, during her husband’s lifetime, she unites herself to another man, she will be called an adulteress; but, if her husband dies, the law has no further hold on her, nor, if she unites herself to another man, is she an adulteress.
045	ROM	007	004	And so with you, my friends; as far as the Law was concerned, you underwent death in the crucified body of the Christ, so that you might be united to another, to him who was raised from the dead, in order that our lives might bear fruit for God.
045	ROM	007	005	When we were living merely earthly lives, our sinful passions, aroused by the Law, were active in every part of our bodies, with the result that our lives bore fruit for death.
045	ROM	007	006	But now we are set free from the Law, because we are dead to that which once kept us under restraint; and so we serve under new, spiritual conditions, and not under old, written regulations.
045	ROM	007	007	What are we to say, then? That Law and sin are the same thing? Heaven forbid! On the contrary, I should not have learned what sin is, had not it been for Law. If the Law did not say “You must not covet,” I should not know what it is to covet.
045	ROM	007	008	But sin took advantage of the commandment to arouse in me every form of covetousness, for where there is no consciousness of Law sin shows no sign of life.
045	ROM	007	009	There was a time when I myself, unconscious of Law, was alive; but when the commandment was brought home to me, sin sprang into life, while I died!
045	ROM	007	010	The commandment that should have meant life I found to result in death!
045	ROM	007	011	Sin took advantage of the commandment to deceive me, and used it to bring about my death.
045	ROM	007	012	And so the Law is holy, and each commandment is also holy, and just, and good.
045	ROM	007	013	Did, then, a thing, which in itself was good, involve death in my case? Heaven forbid! It was sin that involved death; so that, by its use of what I regarded as good to bring about my death, its true nature might appear; and in this way the commandment showed how intensely sinful sin is.
045	ROM	007	014	We know that the Law is spiritual, but I am earthly – sold into slavery to sin.
045	ROM	007	015	I do not understand my own actions. For I am so far from habitually doing what I want to do, that I find myself doing the thing that I hate.
045	ROM	007	016	But when I do what I want not to do, I am admitting that the Law is right.
045	ROM	007	017	This being so, the action is no longer my own, but is done by the sin which is within me.
045	ROM	007	018	I know that there is nothing good in me – I mean in my earthly nature. For, although it is easy for me to want to do right, to act rightly is not easy.
045	ROM	007	019	I fail to do the good thing that I want to do, but the bad thing that I want not to do – that I habitually do.
045	ROM	007	020	But, when I do the thing that I want not to do, the action is no longer my own, but is done by the sin which is within me.
045	ROM	007	021	This, then, is the law that I find – when I want to do right, wrong presents itself!
045	ROM	007	022	At heart I delight in the Law of God;
045	ROM	007	023	but throughout my body I see a different law, one which is in conflict with the law accepted by my reason, and which endeavours to make me a prisoner to that law of sin which exists throughout my body.
045	ROM	007	024	Miserable man that I am! Who will deliver me from the body that is bringing me to this death?
045	ROM	007	025	Thank God, there is deliverance through Jesus Christ, our Lord! Well then, for myself, with my reason I serve the Law of God, but with my earthly nature the Law of sin.
045	ROM	008	001	There is, therefore, now no condemnation for those who are in union with Christ Jesus;
045	ROM	008	002	for through your union with Christ Jesus, the Law of the life-giving Spirit has set you free from the Law of sin and death.
045	ROM	008	003	What Law could not do, in so far as our earthly nature weakened its action, God did, by sending his own Son, with a nature resembling our sinful nature, to atone for sin. He condemned sin in that earthly nature,
045	ROM	008	004	so that the requirements of the Law might be satisfied in us who live now in obedience, not to our earthly nature, but to the Spirit.
045	ROM	008	005	They who follow their earthly nature are earthly-minded, while they who follow the Spirit are spiritually minded.
045	ROM	008	006	To be earthly-minded means death, to be spiritually minded means life and peace;
045	ROM	008	007	because to be earthly-minded is to be an enemy to God, for such a mind does not submit to the Law of God, nor indeed can it do so.
045	ROM	008	008	They who are earthly cannot please God.
045	ROM	008	009	You, however, are not earthly but spiritual, since the Spirit of God lives within you. Unless a person has the Spirit of Christ, they do not belong to Christ;
045	ROM	008	010	but, if Christ is within you, then, though the body is dead as a consequence of sin, the spirit is life as a consequence of righteousness.
045	ROM	008	011	And, if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead lives within you, he who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will give life even to your mortal bodies, through his Spirit living within you.
045	ROM	008	012	So then, friends, we owe nothing to our earthly nature, that we should live in obedience to it.
045	ROM	008	013	If you live in obedience to your earthly nature, you will inevitably die; but if, by the power of the Spirit, you put an end to the evil habits of the body, you will live.
045	ROM	008	014	All who are guided by the Spirit of God are children of God.
045	ROM	008	015	For you did not receive the spirit of a slave, to fill you once more with fear, but the spirit of a child by adoption, which leads us to cry “Abba, our Father.”
045	ROM	008	016	The Spirit himself unites with our spirits in bearing witness to our being God’s children,
045	ROM	008	017	and if children, then heirs – heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ, since we share Christ’s sufferings in order that we may also share his glory.
045	ROM	008	018	I do not count the sufferings of our present life worthy of mention when compared with the glory that is to be revealed and bestowed on us.
045	ROM	008	019	All nature awaits with eager expectation the appearing of the sons of God.
045	ROM	008	020	For nature was made subject to imperfection – not by its own choice, but owing to him who made it so –
045	ROM	008	021	yet not without the hope that some day nature, also, will be set free from enslavement to decay, and will attain to the freedom which will mark the glory of the children of God.
045	ROM	008	022	We know, indeed, that all nature alike has been groaning in the pains of labour to this very hour.
045	ROM	008	023	And not nature only; but we ourselves also, though we have already a first gift of the Spirit – we ourselves are inwardly groaning, while we eagerly await our full adoption as sons – the redemption of our bodies.
045	ROM	008	024	By our hope we were saved. But the thing hoped for is no longer an object of hope when it is before our eyes; for who hopes for what is before his eyes?
045	ROM	008	025	But when we hope for what is not before our eyes, then we wait for it with patience.
045	ROM	008	026	So, also, the Spirit supports us in our weakness. We do not even know how to pray as we should; but the Spirit himself pleads for us in sighs that can find no utterance.
045	ROM	008	027	Yet he who searches all our hearts knows what the Spirit’s meaning is, because the pleadings of the Spirit for Christ’s people are in accordance with his will.
045	ROM	008	028	But we do know that God causes all things to work together for the good of those who love him – those who have received the call in accordance with his purpose.
045	ROM	008	029	For those whom God chose from the first he also destined from the first to be transformed into likeness to his Son, so that his Son might be the eldest among many brothers and sisters.
045	ROM	008	030	And those whom God destined for this he also called; and those whom he called he also pronounced righteous; and those whom he pronounced righteous he also brought to glory.
045	ROM	008	031	What are we to say, then, in the light of all this? If God is on our side, who can there be against us?
045	ROM	008	032	God did not withhold his own Son, but gave him up on behalf of us all; will he not, then, with him, freely give us all things?
045	ROM	008	033	Who will bring a charge against any of God’s people? He who pronounces them righteous is God!
045	ROM	008	034	Who is there to condemn them? He who died for us is Christ Jesus! – or, rather, it was he who was raised from the dead, and who is now at God’s right hand and is even pleading on our behalf!
045	ROM	008	035	Who is there to separate us from the love of the Christ? Will trouble, or difficulty, or persecution, or hunger, or nakedness, or danger, or the sword?
045	ROM	008	036	Scripture says – “For your sake we are being killed all the day long, We are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered.”
045	ROM	008	037	Yet amid all these things we more than conquer through him who loved us!
045	ROM	008	038	For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor archangels, nor the present, nor the future, nor any powers,
045	ROM	008	039	nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, will be able to separate us from the love of God revealed in Christ Jesus, our Lord!
045	ROM	009	001	I am speaking the truth as one in union with Christ; it is no lie; and my conscience, enlightened by the Holy Spirit,
045	ROM	009	002	bears me out when I say that there is a great weight of sorrow on me and that my heart is never free from pain.
045	ROM	009	003	I could wish that I were myself accursed and severed from the Christ, for the sake of my people – my own flesh and blood.
045	ROM	009	004	For they are Israelites, and theirs are the adoption as children, the visible presence, the covenants, the revealed Law, the Temple worship, and the promises.
045	ROM	009	005	They are descended from the patriarchs, and, as far as his human nature was concerned, from them came the Christ – he who is supreme over all things, God for ever blessed. Amen.
045	ROM	009	006	Not that God’s Word has failed. For it is not all who are descended from Israel who are true Israelites;
045	ROM	009	007	nor, because they are Abraham’s descendants, are they all his children; but – “It is Isaac’s children who will be called your descendants.”
045	ROM	009	008	This means that it is not the children born in the course of nature who are God’s children, but it is the children born in fulfilment of the promise who are to be regarded as Abraham’s descendants.
045	ROM	009	009	For these words are the words of a promise – “About this time I will come, and Sarah will have a son.”
045	ROM	009	010	Nor is that all. There is also the case of Rebecca, when she was about to bear children to our ancestor Isaac.
045	ROM	009	011	For in order that the purpose of God, working through selection, might not fail – a selection depending, not on obedience, but on his call – Rebecca was told, before her children were born and before they had done anything either right or wrong,
045	ROM	009	012	that the elder would be a servant to the younger.
045	ROM	009	013	The words of scripture are – “I loved Jacob, but I hated Esau.”
045	ROM	009	014	What are we to say, then? Is God guilty of injustice? Heaven forbid!
045	ROM	009	015	For his words to Moses are – “I will take pity on whom I take pity, and be merciful to whom I am merciful.”
045	ROM	009	016	So, then, all depends, not on human wishes or human efforts, but on God’s mercy.
045	ROM	009	017	In scripture, again, it is said to Pharaoh – “It was for this purpose that I raised you to the throne, to show my power by my dealings with you, and to make my name known throughout the world.”
045	ROM	009	018	So, then, where God wills, he takes pity, and where he wills, he hardens the heart.
045	ROM	009	019	Perhaps you will say to me – “How can anyone still be blamed? For who withstands his purpose?”
045	ROM	009	020	I might rather ask “Who are you who are arguing with God?” Does a thing which a person has moulded say to the person who has moulded it “Why did you make me like this?”
045	ROM	009	021	Has not the potter absolute power over their clay, so that out of the same lump they make one thing for better, and another for common, use?
045	ROM	009	022	And what if God, intending to reveal his displeasure and make his power known, bore most patiently with the objects of his displeasure, though they were fit only to be destroyed,
045	ROM	009	023	so as to make known his surpassing glory in dealing with the objects of his mercy, whom he prepared beforehand for glory,
045	ROM	009	024	and whom he called – even us – not only from among the Jews but from among the Gentiles also!
045	ROM	009	025	This, indeed, is what he says in the book of Hosea – “Those who were not my people, I will call my people, and those who were unloved I will love.
045	ROM	009	026	And in the place where it was said to them – ‘You are not my people’, they will be called sons of the living God.”
045	ROM	009	027	And Isaiah cries aloud over Israel – “Though the sons of Israel are like the sand of the sea in number, only a remnant of them will escape!
045	ROM	009	028	For the Lord will execute his sentence on the world, fully and without delay.”
045	ROM	009	029	It is as Isaiah foretold – “Had not the Lord of Hosts spared some few of our people to us, we should have become like Sodom and been made to resemble Gomorrah.”
045	ROM	009	030	What are we to say, then? Why, that Gentiles, who were not in search of righteousness, secured it – a righteousness which was the result of faith;
045	ROM	009	031	while Israel, which was in search of a Law which would ensure righteousness, failed to discover one.
045	ROM	009	032	And why? Because they looked to obedience, and not to faith, to secure it. They stumbled over the stumbling-block.
045	ROM	009	033	As scripture says – “See, I place a stumbling-block in Zion – a rock which will prove a hindrance; and he who believes in him will have no cause for shame.”
045	ROM	010	001	My friends, my heart’s desire and prayer to God for my people is for their salvation.
045	ROM	010	002	I can testify that they are zealous for the honour of God; but they are not guided by true insight,
045	ROM	010	003	for, in their ignorance of the divine righteousness, and in their eagerness to set up a righteousness of their own, they refused to accept with submission the divine righteousness.
045	ROM	010	004	For Christ has brought Law to an end, so that righteousness may be obtained by everyone who believes in him.
045	ROM	010	005	For Moses writes that, as for the righteousness which results from Law, those who practice it will find life through it.
045	ROM	010	006	But the righteousness which results from faith finds expression in these words: “Do not say to yourself ‘Who will go up into heaven?’” (which means to bring Christ down)
045	ROM	010	007	“or ‘Who will go down into the depths below?’” (which means to bring Christ up from the dead).
045	ROM	010	008	No, but what does it say? “The message is near you, on your lips and in your heart” (which means “The message of faith” which we proclaim).
045	ROM	010	009	For, if with your lips you acknowledge the truth of the message that JESUS IS LORD, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
045	ROM	010	010	For with their hearts people believe and so attain to righteousness, while with their lips they make their profession of faith and so find salvation.
045	ROM	010	011	As the passage of scripture says – “No one who believes in him will have any cause for shame.”
045	ROM	010	012	For no distinction is made between the Jew and the Greek, for all have the same Lord, and he is bountiful to all who invoke him.
045	ROM	010	013	For everyone who invokes the name of the Lord will be saved.
045	ROM	010	014	But how, it may be asked, are they to invoke one in whom they have not learned to believe? And how are they to believe in one whose words they have not heard? And how are they to hear his words unless someone proclaims him?
045	ROM	010	015	And how is anyone to proclaim him unless they are sent as his messengers? As scripture says – “How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!”
045	ROM	010	016	Still, it may be said, everyone did not give heed to the good news. No, for Isaiah asks – “Lord, who has believed our teaching?”
045	ROM	010	017	And so we gather, faith is a result of teaching, and the teaching comes in the message of Christ.
045	ROM	010	018	But I ask “Is it possible that people have never heard?” No, indeed, for – “Their voices spread through all the earth, and their message to the ends of the world.”
045	ROM	010	019	But again I ask “Did not the people of Israel understand?” First there is Moses, who says – “I, the Lord, will stir you to rivalry with a nation which is no nation; against an undiscerning nation I will arouse your anger.”
045	ROM	010	020	And Isaiah says boldly – “I was found by those who were not seeking me; I made myself known to those who were not inquiring of me.”
045	ROM	010	021	But of the people of Israel he says – “All day long I have stretched out my hands to a people who disobey and contradict.”
045	ROM	011	001	I ask, then, “Has God rejected his people?” Heaven forbid! For I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.
045	ROM	011	002	God has not rejected his people, whom he chose from the first. Have you forgotten the words of scripture in the story of Elijah – how he appeals to God against Israel?
045	ROM	011	003	“Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have pulled down your altars, and I only am left; and now they are eager to take my life.”
045	ROM	011	004	But what was the divine response? “I have kept for myself seven thousand who have never bowed the knee to Baal.”
045	ROM	011	005	And so in our own time, too, there is to be found a remnant of our nation selected by God in love.
045	ROM	011	006	But if in love, then it is not as a result of obedience. Otherwise love would cease to be love.
045	ROM	011	007	What follows from this? Why, that Israel as a nation failed to secure what it was seeking, while those whom God selected did secure it.
045	ROM	011	008	The rest grew callous; as scripture says – “God has given them a deadness of mind – eyes that are not to see and ears that are not to hear – and it is so to this very day.”
045	ROM	011	009	David, too, says – “May their feasts prove a snare and a trap to them – a hindrance and a retribution;
045	ROM	011	010	may their eyes be darkened, so that they cannot see; and do you always make their backs to bend.”
045	ROM	011	011	I ask then – “Was their stumbling to result in their fall?” Heaven forbid! On the contrary, through their falling away salvation has reached the Gentiles, to stir the rivalry of Israel.
045	ROM	011	012	And, if their falling away has enriched the world, and their failure has enriched the Gentiles, how much more will result from their full restoration!
045	ROM	011	013	But I am speaking to you who were Gentiles.
045	ROM	011	014	Being myself an apostle to the Gentiles, I exalt my office, in the hope that I may stir my countrymen to rivalry, and so save some of them.
045	ROM	011	015	For, if their being cast aside has meant the reconciliation of the world, what will their reception mean, but life from the dead?
045	ROM	011	016	If the first handful of dough is holy, so is the whole mass, and if the root is holy, so are the branches.
045	ROM	011	017	Some, however, of the branches were broken off, and you, who were only a wild olive, were grafted in among them, and came to share with them the root which is the source of the richness of the cultivated olive.
045	ROM	011	018	Yet do not exult over the other branches. But, if you do exult over them, remember that you do not support the root, but that the root supports you.
045	ROM	011	019	But branches, you will say, were broken off, so that I might be grafted in.
045	ROM	011	020	True, it was because of their want of faith that they were broken off, and it is because of your faith that you are standing. Do not think too highly of yourself, but beware.
045	ROM	011	021	For, if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you.
045	ROM	011	022	See, then, both the goodness and the severity of God – his severity towards those who fell, and his goodness towards you, provided that you continue to confide in that goodness; otherwise you, also, will be cut off.
045	ROM	011	023	And they, too, if they do not continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in; for God has it in his power to graft them in again.
045	ROM	011	024	If you were cut off from your natural stock – a wild olive – and were grafted, contrary to the course of nature, on a good olive, much more will they – the natural branches – be grafted back into their parent tree.
045	ROM	011	025	My friends, so that you don’t think too highly of yourselves, I want you to recognise the truth, hitherto hidden, that the callousness which has come over Israel is only partial, and will continue only until the whole Gentile world has been gathered in.
045	ROM	011	026	And then all Israel will be saved. As scripture says – “From Zion will come the Deliverer; he will banish ungodliness from Jacob.
045	ROM	011	027	And they will see the fulfilment of my covenant, when I have taken away their sins.”
045	ROM	011	028	From the standpoint of the good news, the Jews are God’s enemies for your sake; but from the standpoint of God’s selection, they are dear to him for the sake of the patriarchs.
045	ROM	011	029	For God never regrets his gifts or his call.
045	ROM	011	030	Just as you at one time were disobedient to him, but have now found mercy in the day of their disobedience;
045	ROM	011	031	so, too, they have now become disobedient in your day of mercy, in order that they also in their turn may now find mercy.
045	ROM	011	032	For God has given all alike over to disobedience, that to all alike he may show mercy.
045	ROM	011	033	Oh! The unfathomable wisdom and knowledge of God! How inscrutable are his judgments, how untraceable his ways! Yes –
045	ROM	011	034	ho has ever comprehended the mind of the Lord? Who has ever become his counsellor?
045	ROM	011	035	Or who has first given to him, so that he may claim a reward?
045	ROM	011	036	For all things are from him, through him, and for him. And to him be all glory for ever and ever! Amen.
045	ROM	012	001	I entreat you, then, friends, by the mercies of God, to offer your bodies as a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, for this is your rational worship.
045	ROM	012	002	Do not conform to the fashion of this world; but be transformed by the complete change that has come over your minds, so that you may discern what God’s will is – all that is good, acceptable, and perfect.
045	ROM	012	003	In fulfilment of the charge with which I have been entrusted, I tell every one of you not to think more highly of themselves than they ought to think, but to think until they learn to think soberly – in accordance with the measure of faith that God has allotted to each.
045	ROM	012	004	For, just as in the human body there is a union of many parts, and each part has its own function,
045	ROM	012	005	so we, by our union in Christ, many though we are, form but one body, and individually we are related one to another as its parts.
045	ROM	012	006	Since our gifts differ in accordance with the particular charge entrusted to us, if our gift is to preach, let our preaching correspond to our faith;
045	ROM	012	007	if it is to minister to others, let us devote ourselves to our ministry; the teacher to their teaching,
045	ROM	012	008	the counselor to their counsel. Let the person who gives in charity do so with a generous heart; let the person who is in authority exercise due diligence; let the person who shows kindness do so in a cheerful spirit.
045	ROM	012	009	Let your love be sincere. Hate the wrong; cling to the right.
045	ROM	012	010	In the love of the community of the Lord’s followers, be affectionate to one another; in showing respect, set an example of deference to one another;
045	ROM	012	011	never flagging in zeal; fervent in spirit; serving the Master;
045	ROM	012	012	rejoicing in your hope; steadfast under persecution; persevering in prayer;
045	ROM	012	013	relieving the wants of Christ’s people; devoted to hospitality.
045	ROM	012	014	Bless your persecutors – bless and never curse.
045	ROM	012	015	Rejoice with those who are rejoicing, and weep with those who are weeping.
045	ROM	012	016	Let the same spirit of sympathy animate you all, not a spirit of pride; enjoy the company of ordinary people. Do not think too highly of yourselves.
045	ROM	012	017	Never return injury for injury. Aim at doing what everyone will recognise as honourable.
045	ROM	012	018	If it is possible, as far as rests with you, live peaceably with everyone.
045	ROM	012	019	Never avenge yourselves, dear friends, but make way for the wrath of God; for scripture declares – “‘It is for me to avenge, I will requite,’ says the Lord.”
045	ROM	012	020	Rather – “If your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him to drink. By doing this you will heap coals of fire on his head.”
045	ROM	012	021	Never be conquered by evil, but conquer evil with good.
045	ROM	013	001	Let everyone obey the supreme authorities. For no authority exists except by the will of God, and the existing authorities have been appointed by God.
045	ROM	013	002	Therefore the one who sets themself against the authorities is resisting God’s appointment, and those who resist will bring a judgment on themselves.
045	ROM	013	003	A good action has nothing to fear from rulers; a bad action has. Do you want to have no reason to fear the authorities? Then do what is good, and you will win their praise.
045	ROM	013	004	For they are God’s servants appointed for your good. But, if you do what is wrong, you may well be afraid; for the sword they carry is not without meaning! They are God’s servants to inflict his punishments on those who do wrong.
045	ROM	013	005	You are bound, therefore, to obey, not only through fear of God’s punishments, but also as a matter of conscience.
045	ROM	013	006	This, too, is the reason for your paying taxes; for the officials are God’s officers, devoting themselves to this special work.
045	ROM	013	007	In all cases pay what is due from you – tribute where tribute is due, taxes where taxes are due, respect where respect is due, and honour where honour is due.
045	ROM	013	008	Owe nothing to anyone except love; for they who love their neighbour have satisfied the Law.
045	ROM	013	009	The commandments, “You must not commit adultery, you must not kill, you must not steal, you must not covet,” and whatever other commandment there is, are all summed up in the words – “You must love your neighbour as you love yourself.”
045	ROM	013	010	Love never wrongs a neighbour. Therefore love fully satisfies the Law.
045	ROM	013	011	This I say, because you know the crisis that we have reached, for the time has already come for you to rouse yourselves from sleep; our salvation is nearer now than when we accepted the faith.
045	ROM	013	012	The night is almost gone; the day is near. Therefore let us be done with the deeds of darkness, and arm ourselves with the weapons of light.
045	ROM	013	013	Being in the light of day, let us live becomingly, not in revelry and drunkenness, not in lust and licentiousness, not in quarrelling and jealousy.
045	ROM	013	014	No! Arm yourselves with the spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ, and spend no thought on your earthly nature, to satisfy its cravings.
045	ROM	014	001	As for those whose faith is weak, always receive them as friends, but not for the purpose of passing judgment on their scruples.
045	ROM	014	002	One person’s faith permits them to eat food of all kinds, while another whose faith is weak eats only vegetable food.
045	ROM	014	003	The person who eats meat must not despise the person who abstains from it; nor must the person who abstains from eating meat pass judgment on the one who eats it, for God himself has received them.
045	ROM	014	004	Who are you, that you should pass judgment on the servant of another? Their standing or falling concerns their own master. And stand they will, for their Master can enable them to stand.
045	ROM	014	005	Again, one person considers some days to be more sacred than others, while another considers all days to be alike. Everyone ought to be fully convinced in their own mind.
045	ROM	014	006	The person who observes a day, observes it to the Master’s honour. They, again, who eat meat eat it to the Master’s honour, for they give thanks to God; while the person who abstains from it abstains from it to the Master’s honour, and also gives thanks to God.
045	ROM	014	007	There is not one of us whose life concerns ourselves alone, and not one of us whose death concerns ourself alone;
045	ROM	014	008	for, if we live, our life is for the Master, and, if we die, our death is for the Master. Whether, then, we live or die we belong to the Master.
045	ROM	014	009	The purpose for which Christ died and came back to life was this – that he might be Lord over both the dead and the living.
045	ROM	014	010	I would ask the one “Why do you judge other followers of the Lord?” And I would ask the other “Why do you despise them?” For we will all stand before the court of God.
045	ROM	014	011	For scripture says – “‘As surely as I live,’ says the Lord, ‘every knee will bend before me and every tongue will praise God.’”
045	ROM	014	012	So, then, each one of us will have to render account of himself to God.
045	ROM	014	013	Let us, then, cease to judge one another. Rather let this be your resolve – never to place a stumbling-block or an obstacle in the way of a fellow follower of the Lord.
045	ROM	014	014	Through my union with the Lord Jesus, I know and am persuaded that nothing is defiling in itself. A thing is “defiling” only to the person who holds it to be so.
045	ROM	014	015	If, for the sake of what you eat, you wound your fellow follower’s feelings, your life has ceased to be ruled by love. Do not, by what you eat, ruin someone for whom Christ died!
045	ROM	014	016	Do not let what is right for you become a matter of reproach.
045	ROM	014	017	For the kingdom of God does not consist of eating and drinking, but of righteousness and peace and gladness through the presence of the Holy Spirit.
045	ROM	014	018	The person who serves the Christ in this way pleases God, and wins the approval of their fellows.
045	ROM	014	019	Therefore our efforts should be directed towards all that makes for peace and the mutual building up of character.
045	ROM	014	020	Do not undo God’s work for the sake of what you eat. Though everything is “clean,” yet, if a person eats so as to put a stumbling-block in the way of others, they do wrong.
045	ROM	014	021	The right course is to abstain from meat or wine or, indeed, anything that is a stumbling-block to your fellow follower of the Lord.
045	ROM	014	022	As for yourself – keep this conviction of yours to yourself, as in the presence of God. Happy the person who never has to condemn themselves in regard to something they think right!
045	ROM	014	023	The person, however, who has misgivings stands condemned if they still eat, because their doing so is not the result of faith. And anything not done as the result of faith is a sin.
045	ROM	015	001	We, the strong, ought to take on our own shoulders the weaknesses of those who are not strong, and not merely to please ourselves.
045	ROM	015	002	Let each of us please our neighbour for our neighbour’s good, to help in the building up of their character.
045	ROM	015	003	Even the Christ did not please himself! On the contrary, as scripture says of him – “The reproaches of those who were reproaching you fell upon me.”
045	ROM	015	004	Whatever was written in the scriptures in days gone by was written for our instruction, so that, through patient endurance, and through the encouragement drawn from the scriptures, we might hold fast to our hope.
045	ROM	015	005	And may God, the giver of this patience and this encouragement, grant you to be united in sympathy in Christ,
045	ROM	015	006	so that with one heart and one voice you may praise the God and Father of Jesus Christ, our Lord.
045	ROM	015	007	Therefore always receive one another as friends, just as the Christ himself received us, to the glory of God.
045	ROM	015	008	For I tell you that Christ, in vindication of God’s truthfulness, has become a minister of the covenant of circumcision, so that he may fulfil the promises made to our ancestors,
045	ROM	015	009	and that the Gentiles also may praise God for his mercy. As scripture says – “Therefore will I make acknowledgment to you among the Gentiles and sing in honour of your name.”
045	ROM	015	010	And again it says – “Rejoice, you Gentiles, with God’s people.”
045	ROM	015	011	And yet again – “Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles, and let all Peoples sing his praises.”
045	ROM	015	012	Again, Isaiah says – “There will be a Scion of the house of Jesse, One who is to arise to rule the Gentiles; on him will the Gentiles rest their hopes.”
045	ROM	015	013	May God, who inspires our hope, grant you perfect happiness and peace in your faith, until you are filled with this hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.
045	ROM	015	014	I am persuaded, my friends – yes, I Paul, with regard to you – that you are yourselves full of kindness, furnished with all Christian learning, and well able to give advice to one another.
045	ROM	015	015	But in parts of this letter I have expressed myself somewhat boldly – by way of refreshing your memories –
045	ROM	015	016	because of the charge with which God has entrusted me, that I should be an assistant of Christ Jesus to go to the Gentiles – that I should act as a priest of God’s good news, so that the offering up of the Gentiles may be an acceptable sacrifice, consecrated by the Holy Spirit.
045	ROM	015	017	It is, then, through my union with Christ Jesus that I have a proud confidence in my work for God.
045	ROM	015	018	For I will not dare to speak of anything but what Christ has done through me to win the obedience of the Gentiles –
045	ROM	015	019	by my words and actions, through the power displayed in signs and marvels, and through the power of the Holy Spirit. And so, starting from Jerusalem and going as far as Illyria, I have told in full the good news of the Christ;
045	ROM	015	020	yet always with the ambition to tell the good news where Christ’s name had not previously been heard, so as to avoid building on another’s foundations.
045	ROM	015	021	But as scripture says – “They to whom he had never been proclaimed will see; and they who have never heard will understand!”
045	ROM	015	022	That is why I have so often been prevented from coming to you.
045	ROM	015	023	But now there are no further openings for me in these parts, and I have for several years been longing to come to you whenever I may be going to Spain.
045	ROM	015	024	For my hope is to visit you on my journey, and then to be sent on my way by you, after I have first partly satisfied myself by seeing something of you.
045	ROM	015	025	Just now, however, I am on my way to Jerusalem, to take help to Christ’s people there.
045	ROM	015	026	For Macedonia and Greece have been glad to make a collection for the poor among Christ’s people at Jerusalem.
045	ROM	015	027	Yes, they were glad to do so; and indeed it is a duty which they owe to them. For the Gentile converts who have shared their spiritual blessings are in duty bound to minister to them in the things of this world.
045	ROM	015	028	When I have settled this matter, and have secured for the poor at Jerusalem the enjoyment of these benefits, I will go, by way of you, to Spain.
045	ROM	015	029	And I know that, when I come to you, it will be with a full measure of blessing from Christ.
045	ROM	015	030	I beg you, then, friends, by Jesus Christ, our Lord, and by the love inspired by the Spirit, to join me in earnest prayer to God on my behalf.
045	ROM	015	031	Pray that I may be rescued from those in Judea who reject the faith, and that the help which I am taking to Jerusalem may prove acceptable to Christ’s people;
045	ROM	015	032	so that, God willing, I may be able to come to you with a joyful heart, and enjoy some rest among you.
045	ROM	015	033	May God, the giver of peace, be with you all. Amen.
045	ROM	016	001	I commend to your care our sister, Phoebe, who is a minister of the church at Cenchreae;
045	ROM	016	002	and I ask you to give her a Christian welcome – one worthy of Christ’s people – and to aid her in any matter in which she may need your assistance. She has proved herself a staunch friend and protector and to many others.
045	ROM	016	003	Give my greeting to Prisca and Aquila, my fellow workers in the cause of Christ Jesus,
045	ROM	016	004	who risked their own lives to save mine. It is not I alone who thank them, but all the churches among the Gentiles thank them also.
045	ROM	016	005	Give my greeting, also, to the church that meets at their house, as well as to my dear friend Epaenetus, one of the first in Roman Asia to believe in Christ;
045	ROM	016	006	to Mary, who worked hard for you;
045	ROM	016	007	to Andronicus and Junia, fellow Jews and once my fellow prisoners, who are people of note among the apostles, and who became Christians before I did;
045	ROM	016	008	to my dear Christian friend Ampliatus;
045	ROM	016	009	to Urban, our fellow worker in the cause of Christ, and to my dear friend Stachys;
045	ROM	016	010	to that tried and true Christian Apelles; to the household of Aristobulus;
045	ROM	016	011	to my countryman Herodion; to the Christians in the household of Narcissus;
045	ROM	016	012	to Tryphaena and Tryphosa, who have worked hard for the Master; to my dear friend Persis, for she has done much hard work for the Master;
045	ROM	016	013	to that eminent Christian, Rufus, and to his mother, who has been a mother to me also;
045	ROM	016	014	to Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and our friends with them;
045	ROM	016	015	also to Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and to all Christ’s people who are with them.
045	ROM	016	016	Greet one another with a sacred kiss. All the churches of the Christ send you greetings.
045	ROM	016	017	I beg you, friends, to be on your guard against people who, by disregarding the teaching which you received, cause divisions and create difficulties; dissociate yourselves from them.
045	ROM	016	018	For such persons are not serving Christ, our Master, but are slaves to their own appetites; and, by their smooth words and flattery, they deceive simple-minded people.
045	ROM	016	019	Everyone has heard of your ready obedience. It is true that I am very happy about you, but I want you to be well versed in all that is good, and innocent of all that is bad.
045	ROM	016	020	And God, the giver of peace, will before long crush Satan under your feet. May the blessing of Jesus, our Lord, be with you.
045	ROM	016	021	Timothy, my fellow worker, sends you his greetings, and Lucius, Jason, and Sosipater, my countrymen, send theirs.
045	ROM	016	022	I Tertius, who am writing this letter, send you my Christian greeting.
045	ROM	016	023	My host Gaius, who extends his hospitality to the whole church, sends you his greeting; and Erastus, the city treasurer, and Quartus, our dear friend, add theirs.
045	ROM	016	025	Now to him who is able to strengthen you, as promised in the good news entrusted to me and in the proclamation of Jesus Christ, in accordance with the revelation of that hidden purpose, which in past ages was kept secret but now has been revealed
045	ROM	016	026	and, in obedience to the command of the immortal God, made known through the writings of the prophets to all nations, to secure submission to the faith –
045	ROM	016	027	to him, I say, the wise and only God, be ascribed, through Jesus Christ, all glory for ever and ever. Amen.

# BOOK	046	1CO	1 Corinthians	1 Corinthians
046	1CO	001	001	To the church of God in Corinth, to those who have been consecrated by union with Christ Jesus and called to become his people, and also to all, wherever they may be, who invoke the name of our Lord Jesus Christ – their Master and ours,
046	1CO	001	002	from Paul, who has been called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and from Sosthenes, our fellow follower of the Lord.
046	1CO	001	003	May God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you and give you peace.
046	1CO	001	004	I always thank God for you. I thank him for the blessing bestowed on you in Christ Jesus.
046	1CO	001	005	For through union with him you were enriched in every way – in your power to preach, and in your knowledge of the truth;
046	1CO	001	006	and so became yourselves a confirmation of my testimony to the Christ.
046	1CO	001	007	There is no gift in which you are deficient, while waiting for our Lord Jesus Christ to be revealed.
046	1CO	001	008	And God himself will strengthen you to the end, so that at the day of our Lord Jesus Christ you may be found blameless.
046	1CO	001	009	God will not fail you, and it is he who called you into communion with his Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord.
046	1CO	001	010	But I appeal to you, my friends, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to agree in what you profess, and not to allow divisions to exist among you, but to be united – of one mind and of one opinion.
046	1CO	001	011	For I have been informed, my friends, by the members of Chloe’s household, that party feeling exists among you.
046	1CO	001	012	I mean this: that every one of you says either “I follow Paul,” or “I Apollos,” or “I Cephas,” or “I Christ.”
046	1CO	001	013	You have torn the Christ in pieces! Was it Paul who was crucified for you? Or were you baptised in the name of Paul?
046	1CO	001	014	I am thankful that I did not baptise any of you except Crispus and Gaius,
046	1CO	001	015	so that no one can say that you were baptised in my name.
046	1CO	001	016	I baptised also the household of Stephanas. I do not know that I baptised anyone else.
046	1CO	001	017	My mission from Christ was not to baptise, but to tell the good news; not, however, in the language of philosophy, in case the cross of the Christ should be robbed of its meaning.
046	1CO	001	018	The message of the cross is indeed mere folly to those who are on the path to ruin, but to us who are on the path of salvation it is the power of God.
046	1CO	001	019	For scripture says – “I will bring the philosophy of the philosophers to naught, and the shrewdness of the shrewd I will bring to nothing.”
046	1CO	001	020	Where is the philosopher? Where the teacher of the Law? Where the disputant of today? Has not God shown the world’s philosophy to be folly?
046	1CO	001	021	For since the world, in God’s wisdom, did not by its philosophy learn to know God, God saw fit, by the “folly” of our proclamation, to save those who believe in Christ!
046	1CO	001	022	While Jews ask for miraculous signs, and Greeks study philosophy,
046	1CO	001	023	we are proclaiming Christ crucified! – to the Jews an obstacle, to the Gentiles mere folly,
046	1CO	001	024	but to those who have received the call, whether Jews or Greeks, Christ, the power of God and the wisdom of God!
046	1CO	001	025	For God’s “folly” is wiser than people, and God’s “weakness” is stronger than people.
046	1CO	001	026	Look at the facts of your call, friends. There are not many among you who are wise, as people reckon wisdom, not many who are influential, not many who are high-born;
046	1CO	001	027	but God chose what the world counts foolish to put its wise to shame, and God chose what the world counts weak to put its strong to shame,
046	1CO	001	028	and God chose what the world counts poor and insignificant – things that to it are unreal – to bring its “realities” to nothing,
046	1CO	001	029	so that in his presence no one should boast.
046	1CO	001	030	But you, by your union with Christ Jesus, belong to God; and Christ, by God’s will, became not only our wisdom, but also our righteousness, holiness, and deliverance,
046	1CO	001	031	so that – in the words of scripture – “Whoever boasts should boast of the Lord!”
046	1CO	002	001	For my own part, friends, when I came to you, it was with no display of eloquence or philosophy that I came to tell the hidden purpose of God;
046	1CO	002	002	for I had determined that, while with you, I would forget everything except Jesus Christ – and him crucified!
046	1CO	002	003	Indeed, when I came among you, I was weak, and full of fears, and in great anxiety.
046	1CO	002	004	My message and my proclamation were not delivered in the persuasive language of philosophy, but were accompanied by the manifestation of spiritual power,
046	1CO	002	005	so that your faith should be based, not on the human wisdom, but on the power of God.
046	1CO	002	006	Yet there is a philosophy that we teach to those whose faith is matured, but it is not the philosophy of today, or of the leaders of today – whose downfall is at hand.
046	1CO	002	007	No, it is a divine philosophy that we teach, one concerned with the hidden purpose of God – that long hidden philosophy which God, before time began, destined for our glory.
046	1CO	002	008	This philosophy is clearly not known to any of the leaders of today, since, had they known it, they would never have crucified our glorious Lord!
046	1CO	002	009	It is what scripture speaks of as – “What eye never saw, nor ear ever heard, what never entered people’s minds – all these things God has prepared for those who love him.”
046	1CO	002	010	Yet to us God revealed it through his Spirit; for the Spirit fathoms all things, even the inmost depths of God’s being.
046	1CO	002	011	For what person is there who knows what a person is, except the person’s own spirit within them? So, also, no one comprehends what God is, except the Spirit of God.
046	1CO	002	012	And as for us, it is not the spirit of the world that we have received, but the Spirit that comes from God, so that we may realize the blessings given to us by him.
046	1CO	002	013	And we speak of these gifts, not in language taught by human philosophy, but in language taught by the Spirit, explaining spiritual things in spiritual words.
046	1CO	002	014	The merely intellectual person rejects the teaching of the Spirit of God; for to them it is mere folly; they cannot grasp it, because it is to be understood only by spiritual insight.
046	1CO	002	015	But the person with spiritual insight is able to understand everything, although they themselves are understood by no one.
046	1CO	002	016	For who has so comprehended the mind of the Lord as to be able to instruct him? We, however, have the mind of Christ.
046	1CO	003	001	But I, my friends, could not speak to you as people with spiritual insight, but only as worldly-minded – mere infants in the faith of Christ.
046	1CO	003	002	I fed you with milk, not with solid food, for you were not then able to take it. No, and even now you are not able; you are still worldly.
046	1CO	003	003	While there exist among you jealousy and party feeling, is it not true that you are worldly, and are acting merely as other people do?
046	1CO	003	004	When one says “I follow Paul,” and another “I follow Apollos,” aren’t you like other people?
046	1CO	003	005	What, I ask, is Apollos? Or what is Paul? Servants through whom you were led to accept the faith; and that only as the Lord helped each of you.
046	1CO	003	006	I planted, and Apollos watered, but it was God who caused the growth.
046	1CO	003	007	Therefore neither the one who plants, nor the one who waters, counts for anything, but only God who causes the growth.
046	1CO	003	008	In this the person who plants and the person who waters are one; yet each will receive their own reward in proportion to their own labour.
046	1CO	003	009	For we are God’s fellow workers; you are God’s harvest field, God’s building.
046	1CO	003	010	In fulfilment of the charge which God had entrusted to me, I laid the foundation like a skilful master; but someone else is now building on it. Let everyone take care how they build;
046	1CO	003	011	for no one can lay any other foundation than the one already laid – Jesus Christ.
046	1CO	003	012	Whatever is used by those who build on this foundation, whether gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, or straw,
046	1CO	003	013	the quality of each man’s work will become known, for the day will make it plain; because that day is to be ushered in with fire, and the fire itself will test the quality of every man’s work.
046	1CO	003	014	If anyone’s work, which they have built on that foundation, still remains, they will gain a reward.
046	1CO	003	015	If anyone’s work is burnt up, they will suffer loss; though they themselves will escape, but only as one who has passed through fire.
046	1CO	003	016	Don’t you know that you are God’s Temple, and that God’s Spirit has his home in you?
046	1CO	003	017	If any one destroys the Temple of God, God will destroy them; for the Temple of God is sacred, and so also are you.
046	1CO	003	018	Let no one deceive himself. If any one among you imagines that, as regards this world, they are wise, they should become a “fool,” that they may become wise.
046	1CO	003	019	For in God’s sight this world’s wisdom is folly. Scripture tells of – “One who catches the wise in their own craftiness,”
046	1CO	003	020	And it says again – “The Lord sees how fruitless are the deliberations of the wise.”
046	1CO	003	021	Therefore let no one boast about people; for all things are yours –
046	1CO	003	022	whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or the present, or the future – all things are yours!
046	1CO	003	023	But you are Christ’s and Christ is God’s.
046	1CO	004	001	Let people look on us as Christ’s servants, and as stewards of the hidden truths of God.
046	1CO	004	002	Now what we look for in stewards is that they should be trustworthy.
046	1CO	004	003	But it weighs very little with me that I am judged by you or by any human tribunal. No, I do not even judge myself;
046	1CO	004	004	for, though I am conscious of nothing against myself, that does not prove me innocent. It is the Lord who is my judge.
046	1CO	004	005	Therefore do not pass judgment before the time, but wait until the Lord comes. He will throw light on what is now dark and obscure, and will reveal the motives in people’s minds; and then everyone will receive due praise from God.
046	1CO	004	006	All this, friends, I have, for your sakes, applied to Apollos and myself, so that, from our example, you may learn to observe the precept – “Keep to what is written,” that none of you may speak boastfully of one teacher to the disparagement of another.
046	1CO	004	007	For who makes any one of you superior to others? And what have you that was not given you? But if you received it as a gift, why do you boast as if you had not?
046	1CO	004	008	Are you all so soon satisfied? Are you so soon rich? Have you begun to reign without us? Would indeed that you had, so that we also might reign with you!
046	1CO	004	009	For, as it seems to me, God has exhibited us, the apostles, last of all, as people doomed to death. We are made a spectacle to the universe, both to angels and to people!
046	1CO	004	010	We, for Christ’s sake, are fools, but you, by your union with Christ, are people of discernment. We are weak, but you are strong. You are honoured, but we are despised.
046	1CO	004	011	To this very hour we go hungry, thirsty, and naked; we are beaten; we are homeless;
046	1CO	004	012	we work hard, toiling with our own hands. We meet abuse with blessings, we meet persecution with endurance,
046	1CO	004	013	we meet slander with gentle appeals. We have been treated as the scum of the earth, the vilest of the vile, to this very hour.
046	1CO	004	014	It is with no wish to shame you that I am writing like this; but to warn you as my own dear children.
046	1CO	004	015	Though you may have thousands of instructors in the faith of Christ, yet you have not many fathers. It was I who, through union with Christ Jesus, became your father by means of the good news.
046	1CO	004	016	Therefore I entreat you – Follow my example.
046	1CO	004	017	This is my reason for sending Timothy to you. He is my own dear faithful child in the Master’s service, and he will remind you of my methods of teaching the faith of Christ Jesus – methods which I follow everywhere in every church.
046	1CO	004	018	Some, I hear, are puffed up with pride, thinking that I am not coming to you.
046	1CO	004	019	But come to you I will, and that soon, if it please the Lord; and then I will find out, not what words these people use who are so puffed up, but what power they possess;
046	1CO	004	020	for the kingdom of God is based, not on words, but on power.
046	1CO	004	021	What do you wish? Am I to come to you with a rod, or in a loving and gentle spirit?
046	1CO	005	001	There is a wide-spread report respecting a case of immorality among you, and that, too, of a kind that does not occur even among the Gentiles – a man, I hear, is living with his father’s wife!
046	1CO	005	002	Instead of grieving over it and taking steps for the expulsion of the man who has done this thing, is it possible that you are still puffed up?
046	1CO	005	003	For I myself, though absent in body, have been present with you in spirit, and in the name of our Lord Jesus I have already passed judgment, just as if I had been present, on the man who has acted in this way.
046	1CO	005	004	I have decided – having been present in spirit at your meetings, when the power of the Lord Jesus was with us –
046	1CO	005	005	to deliver such a man as this over to Satan, that what is sensual in him may be destroyed, so that his spirit may be saved at the day of the Lord.
046	1CO	005	006	Your boasting is unseemly. Don’t you know that even a little yeast leavens all the dough?
046	1CO	005	007	Get rid entirely of the old leaven, so that you may be like new dough – free from leaven, as in truth you are. For our passover lamb is already sacrificed – Christ himself;
046	1CO	005	008	therefore let us keep our festival, not with the leaven of former days, nor with the leaven of vice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
046	1CO	005	009	I told you, in my letter, not to associate with immoral people –
046	1CO	005	010	not, of course, meaning people of the world who are in immoral, or who are covetous and grasping, or who worship idols; for then you would have to leave the world altogether.
046	1CO	005	011	But, as things are, I say that you are not to associate with anyone who, although a follower of Christ in name, is immoral, or covetous, or an idolater, or abusive, or a drunkard, or grasping – no, not even to sit down to eat with such people.
046	1CO	005	012	What have I to do with judging those outside the church? Is it not for you to judge those who are within the church,
046	1CO	005	013	while God judges those who are outside? Put away the wicked from among you.
046	1CO	006	001	Can it be that, when one of you has a dispute with another, they dare to have their case tried before the heathen, instead of before Christ’s people?
046	1CO	006	002	Don’t you know that Christ’s people will try the world? And if the world is to be tried by you, are you unfit to try the most trivial cases?
046	1CO	006	003	Don’t you know that we are to try angels – to say nothing of the affairs of this life?
046	1CO	006	004	Why, then, if you have cases relating to the affairs of this life, do you set to try them those who carry no weight with the church? To your shame I ask it.
046	1CO	006	005	Can it be that there is not one among you wise enough to decide between two of their fellow followers?
046	1CO	006	006	Must a follower sue a fellow follower? In front of unbelievers?
046	1CO	006	007	To begin with, it is undoubtedly a loss to you to have lawsuits with one another. Why not rather let yourselves be wronged? Why not rather let yourselves be cheated?
046	1CO	006	008	Instead of this, you wrong and cheat others yourselves – yes, even other followers!
046	1CO	006	009	Don’t you know that wrongdoers will have no share in God’s kingdom? Do not be deceived. No one who is immoral, or an idolater, or an adulterer, or licentious, or a sexual pervert,
046	1CO	006	010	or a thief, or covetous, or a drunkard, or abusive, or grasping, will have any share in God’s kingdom.
046	1CO	006	011	Such some of you used to be; but you washed yourselves clean. You became Christ’s people! You were pronounced righteous through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, and through the Spirit of our God!
046	1CO	006	012	Everything is allowable for me! Yes, but everything is not profitable. Everything is allowable for me! Yes, but for my part, I will not let myself be enslaved by anything.
046	1CO	006	013	Food exists for the stomach, and the stomach for food; but God will put an end to both the one and the other. The body, however, exists, not for immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body;
046	1CO	006	014	and, as God has raised the Lord, so he will raise us up also by the exercise of his power.
046	1CO	006	015	Don’t you know that your bodies are Christ’s members? Am I, then, to take the members that belong to the Christ and make them the members of a prostitute? Heaven forbid!
046	1CO	006	016	Or don’t you know that a man who unites himself with a prostitute is one with her in body (for “the two,” it is said, “will become one”);
046	1CO	006	017	while a man who is united with the Lord is one with him in spirit?
046	1CO	006	018	Shun all immorality. Every other sin that people commit is something outside the body; but an immoral person sins against their own body.
046	1CO	006	019	Again, don’t you know that your body is a shrine of the Holy Spirit that is within you – the Spirit which you have from God?
046	1CO	006	020	Moreover, you are not your own masters; you were bought, and the price was paid. Therefore, honour God in your bodies.
046	1CO	007	001	With reference to the subjects about which you wrote to me: It is good for a man to remain single.
046	1CO	007	002	But, owing to the prevalence of immorality, I advise every man to have his own wife, and every woman her husband.
046	1CO	007	003	A husband should give his wife her due, and a wife her husband.
046	1CO	007	004	It is not the wife, but the husband, who exercises power over her body; and so, too, it is not the husband, but the wife, who exercises power over his body.
046	1CO	007	005	Do not deprive each other of what is due – unless it is only for a time and by mutual consent, so that your minds may be free for prayer until you again live as man and wife – otherwise Satan might take advantage of your want of self-control and tempt you.
046	1CO	007	006	I say this, however, as a concession, not as a command.
046	1CO	007	007	I should wish everyone to be just what I am myself. But everyone has his own gift from God – one in one way, and one in another.
046	1CO	007	008	My advice, then, to those who are not married, and to widows, is this: It would be good for them to remain as I am myself.
046	1CO	007	009	But, if they cannot control themselves, they should marry, for it is better to marry than to be consumed with passion.
046	1CO	007	010	To those who are married my direction is – yet it is not mine, but the Master’s – that a woman is not to leave her husband
046	1CO	007	011	(If she has done so, she should remain as she is, or else be reconciled to her husband) and also that a man is not to divorce his wife.
046	1CO	007	012	To all others I say – I, not the Master – If a follower of the Lord is married to a woman, who is an unbeliever but willing to live with him, he should not divorce her;
046	1CO	007	013	and a woman who is married to a man, who is an unbeliever but willing to live with her, should not divorce her husband.
046	1CO	007	014	For, through his wife, the husband who is an unbeliever has become associated with Christ’s people; and the wife who is an unbeliever has become associated with Christ’s people through the Lord’s follower whom she has married. Otherwise your children would be “defiled,” but, as it is, they belong to Christ’s people.
046	1CO	007	015	However, if the unbeliever wishes to be separated, let them be so. Under such circumstances neither is bound; God has called you to live in peace.
046	1CO	007	016	How can you tell, wife, whether you may not save your husband? And how can you tell, husband, whether you may not save your wife?
046	1CO	007	017	In any case, a person should continue to live in the condition which the Lord has allotted to them, and in which they were when God called them. This is the rule that I lay down in every church.
046	1CO	007	018	Was a man already circumcised when he was called? Then he should not efface his circumcision. Has a man been called when uncircumcised? Then he should not be circumcised.
046	1CO	007	019	Circumcision is nothing; the want of it is nothing; but to keep the commands of God is everything.
046	1CO	007	020	Let everyone remain in that condition of life in which they were when the call came to them.
046	1CO	007	021	Were you a slave when you were called? Do not let that trouble you. No, even if you are able to gain your freedom, still do your best.
046	1CO	007	022	For the person who was a slave when they were called to the master’s service is the Master’s freedman; so, too, the person who was free when called is Christ’s slave.
046	1CO	007	023	You were bought, and the price was paid. Do not let yourselves become slaves to people.
046	1CO	007	024	Friends, let everyone remain in the condition in which they were when they were called, in close communion with God.
046	1CO	007	025	With regard to unmarried women, I have no command from the Master to give you, but I tell you my opinion, and the Master in his mercy has made me worthy to be trusted.
046	1CO	007	026	I think, then, that, in view of the time of suffering that has now come upon us, what I have already said is best – that a man should remain as he is.
046	1CO	007	027	Are you married to a wife? Then do not seek to be separated. Are you separated from a wife? Then do not seek for a wife.
046	1CO	007	028	Still, if you should marry, that is not wrong; nor, if a young woman marries, is that wrong. But those who marry will have much trouble to bear, and my wish is to spare you.
046	1CO	007	029	What I mean, friends, is this – the time is short. Meanwhile, let those who have wives live as if they had none,
046	1CO	007	030	those who are weeping as if not weeping, those who are rejoicing as if not rejoicing, those who buy as if not possessing,
046	1CO	007	031	and those who use the good things of the world as using them sparingly; for this world as we see it is passing away.
046	1CO	007	032	I want you to be free from anxiety. The unmarried man is anxious about the Master’s cause, desiring to please him;
046	1CO	007	033	while the married man is anxious about worldly matters, desiring to please his wife;
046	1CO	007	034	and so his interests are divided. Again, the unmarried woman, whether she is old or young, is anxious about the Master’s cause, striving to be pure both in body and in spirit, while the married woman is anxious about worldly matters, desiring to please her husband.
046	1CO	007	035	I say this for your own benefit, not with any intention of putting a halter round your necks, but in order to secure for the Master seemly and constant devotion, free from all distraction.
046	1CO	007	036	If, however, a father thinks that he is not acting fairly by his unmarried daughter, when she is past her youth, and if under these circumstances her marriage ought to take place, he should act as he thinks right. He is doing nothing wrong – let the marriage take place.
046	1CO	007	037	On the other hand, a father, who has definitely made up his mind, and is under no compulsion, but is free to carry out his own wishes, and who has come to the decision, in his own mind, to keep his unmarried daughter at home will be doing right.
046	1CO	007	038	In short, the one who consents to his daughter’s marriage is doing right, and yet the other will be doing better.
046	1CO	007	039	A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives; but, if the husband should pass to his rest, the widow is free to marry anyone she wishes, provided he is a believer.
046	1CO	007	040	Yet she will be happier if she remains as she is – in my opinion, for I think that I also have the Spirit of God.
046	1CO	008	001	With reference to food that has been offered in sacrifice to idols – We are aware that all of us have knowledge! Knowledge breeds conceit, while love builds up character.
046	1CO	008	002	If someone thinks that they know anything, they have not yet reached that knowledge which they ought to have reached.
046	1CO	008	003	On the other hand, if a person loves God, they are known by God.
046	1CO	008	004	With reference, then, to eating food that has been offered to idols – we are aware that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no God but one.
046	1CO	008	005	Even supposing that there are so-called “gods” either in heaven or on earth – and there are many such “gods” and “lords” –
046	1CO	008	006	Yet for us there is only one God, the Father, from whom all things come (and for him we live), and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things come (and through him we live).
046	1CO	008	007	Still, it is not everyone that has this knowledge. Some people, because of their association with idols, continued down to the present time, eat the food as food offered to an idol; and their consciences, while still weak, are dulled.
046	1CO	008	008	What we eat, however, will not bring us nearer to God. We lose nothing by not eating this food, and we gain nothing by eating it.
046	1CO	008	009	But take care that this right of yours does not become in any way a stumbling-block to the weak.
046	1CO	008	010	For if someone should see you who possess this knowledge, feasting in an idol’s temple, will not their conscience, if they are weak, become so hardened that they, too, will eat food offered to idols?
046	1CO	008	011	And so, through this knowledge of yours, the weak person is ruined – someone for whose sake Christ died!
046	1CO	008	012	In this way, by sinning against your fellow followers of the Lord and injuring their consciences, while still weak, you sin against Christ.
046	1CO	008	013	Therefore, if what I eat makes a follower of the Lord fall, rather than make them fall, I will never eat meat again.
046	1CO	009	001	Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen our Lord Jesus? Aren’t you yourselves my work achieved in union with the Lord?
046	1CO	009	002	If I am not an apostle to others, yet at least I am to you; for you are the seal that stamps me as an apostle in union with the Lord.
046	1CO	009	003	The defence that I make to my critics is this:
046	1CO	009	004	Haven’t we a right to food and drink?
046	1CO	009	005	Haven’t we a right to take a wife with us, if she is a Christian, as the other apostles and the Master’s brothers and Cephas all do?
046	1CO	009	006	Or is it only Barnabas and I who have no right to give up working for our bread?
046	1CO	009	007	Does anyone ever serve as a soldier at his own expense? Does anyone plant a vineyard and not eat its produce? Or does anyone look after a herd and not drink the milk?
046	1CO	009	008	Am I, in all this, speaking only from the human standpoint? Does not the Law also say the same?
046	1CO	009	009	For in the Law of Moses it is said – “You should not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain.” Is it the bullocks that God is thinking of?
046	1CO	009	010	Or is not is said entirely for our sakes? Surely it was written for our sakes, for the ploughman ought not to plough, nor the thrasher to thrash, without expecting a share of the grain.
046	1CO	009	011	Since we, then, sowed spiritual seed for you, is it too much that we should reap from you an earthly harvest?
046	1CO	009	012	If others share in this right over you, don’t we even more? Still we did not avail ourselves of this right. No, we endure anything rather than impede the progress of the good news of the Christ.
046	1CO	009	013	Don’t you know that those who do the work of the Temple live on what comes from the Temple, and that those who serve at the altar share the offerings with the altar?
046	1CO	009	014	So, too, the Master has appointed that those who tell the good news should get their living from the good news.
046	1CO	009	015	I, however, have not availed myself of any of these rights. I am not saying this to secure such an arrangement for myself; indeed, I would far rather die – Nobody will make my boast a vain one!
046	1CO	009	016	If I proclaim the good news, I have nothing to boast of, for I am compelled to do so. Woe is me if I do not share it!
046	1CO	009	017	If I do this work willingly, I have a reward; but, if unwillingly, I have been charged to perform a duty.
046	1CO	009	018	What is my reward, then? To present the good news free of all cost, and so make but a sparing use of the rights which it gives me.
046	1CO	009	019	Although I was entirely free, yet, to win as many converts as possible, I made myself everyone’s slave.
046	1CO	009	020	To the Jews I became like a Jew, to win Jews. To those who are subject to Law I became like a man subject to Law – though I was not myself subject to Law – to win those who are subject to Law.
046	1CO	009	021	To those who have no Law I became like a man who has no Law – not that I am free from God’s Law; no, for I am under Christ’s Law – to win those who have no law.
046	1CO	009	022	To the weak I became weak, to win the weak. I have become all things to all people, so as at all costs to save some.
046	1CO	009	023	And I do everything for the sake of the good news, so that with them I may share in its blessings.
046	1CO	009	024	Don’t you know that on a racecourse, though all run, yet only one wins the prize? Run in such a way that you may win.
046	1CO	009	025	Every athlete exercises self-restraint in everything; they, indeed, for a crown that fades, we for one that is unfading.
046	1CO	009	026	I, therefore, do not run aimlessly. I do not box like a man hitting the air.
046	1CO	009	027	No, I bruise my body and make it my slave, so that I, who have called others to the contest, will not myself be rejected.
046	1CO	010	001	I want you to bear in mind, friends, that all our ancestors were beneath the cloud, and all passed through the sea;
046	1CO	010	002	that in the cloud and in the sea they all underwent baptism as followers of Moses;
046	1CO	010	003	and that they all ate the same supernatural food,
046	1CO	010	004	and all drank the same supernatural water, for they used to drink from a supernatural rock which followed them, and that rock was the Christ.
046	1CO	010	005	Yet with most of them God was displeased; for they were struck down in the desert.
046	1CO	010	006	Now these things happened as warnings to us, to teach us not to long for evil things as our ancestors longed.
046	1CO	010	007	Do not become idolaters, as some of them became. Scripture says – “The people sat down to eat and drink, and stood up to dance.”
046	1CO	010	008	Nor let us act immorally, as some of them acted, with the result that twenty-three thousand of them fell dead in a single day.
046	1CO	010	009	Nor let us try the patience of the Lord too far, as some of them tried it, with the result that they were, one after another, destroyed by snakes.
046	1CO	010	010	And do not murmur, as some of them murmured, and so were destroyed by the angel of death.
046	1CO	010	011	These things happened to them by way of warning, and were recorded to serve as a caution to us, in whose days the close of the ages has come.
046	1CO	010	012	Therefore let the person who thinks that they stand take care that they do not fall.
046	1CO	010	013	No temptation has come upon you that is not common to all humanity. God will not fail you, and he will not allow you to be tempted beyond your strength; but, when he sends the temptation, he will also provide the way of escape, so that you may have strength to endure.
046	1CO	010	014	Therefore, my dear friends, shun the worship of idols.
046	1CO	010	015	I speak to you as man of discernment; form your own judgment about what I am saying.
046	1CO	010	016	In the cup of blessing which we bless, is not there a sharing in the blood of the Christ? And in the bread which we break, is not there a sharing in the body of the Christ?
046	1CO	010	017	The bread is one, and we, though many, are one body; for we all partake of that one bread.
046	1CO	010	018	Look at the people of Israel. Do not those who eat the sacrifices share with the altar?
046	1CO	010	019	What do I mean? That an offering made to an idol, or the idol itself, is anything?
046	1CO	010	020	No; what I say is that the sacrifices offered by the Gentiles are offered to demons and to a being who is no God, and I do not want you to share with demons.
046	1CO	010	021	You cannot drink both the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You cannot partake at the table of the Lord and at the table of demons.
046	1CO	010	022	Or are we to rouse the jealousy of the Lord? Are we stronger than he?
046	1CO	010	023	Everything is allowable! Yes, but everything is not profitable. Everything is allowable! Yes, but everything does not build up character.
046	1CO	010	024	A person must not study their own interests, but the interests of others.
046	1CO	010	025	Eat anything that is sold in the market, without making inquiries to satisfy your scruples;
046	1CO	010	026	for the earth, with all that is in it, belongs to the Lord.
046	1CO	010	027	If an unbeliever invites you to his house and you consent to go, eat anything that is put before you, without making inquiries to satisfy your scruples.
046	1CO	010	028	But, if anyone should say to you “This has been offered in sacrifice to an idol,” then, for the sake of the speaker and his scruples, do not eat it.
046	1CO	010	029	I do not say your scruples, but his. For why should the freedom that I claim be condemned by the scruples of another?
046	1CO	010	030	If, for my part, I take the food thankfully, why should I be abused for eating that for which I give thanks?
046	1CO	010	031	Whether, then, you eat or drink or whatever you do, do everything to the honour of God.
046	1CO	010	032	Do not cause offence either to Jews or Greeks or to the church of God;
046	1CO	010	033	for I, also, try to please everybody in everything, not seeking my own advantage, but do what is best for others, so that they may be saved.
046	1CO	011	001	Imitate me, as I myself imitate Christ.
046	1CO	011	002	I praise you, indeed, because you never forget me, and are keeping my injunctions in mind, exactly as I laid them on you.
046	1CO	011	003	But I am anxious that you should understand that the Christ is the head of every man, that man is the head of woman, and that God is the head of the Christ.
046	1CO	011	004	Any man who keeps his head covered, when praying or preaching in public, dishonours him who is his head;
046	1CO	011	005	while any woman, who prays or preaches in public bare-headed, dishonours him who is her head; for that is to make herself like one of the shameless women who shave their heads.
046	1CO	011	006	Indeed, if a woman does not keep her head covered, she may as well cut her hair short. But, since to cut her hair short, or shave it off, marks her as one of the shameless women, she should keep her head covered.
046	1CO	011	007	A man ought not to have his head covered, for he has been from the beginning the likeness of God and the reflection of his glory, but woman is the reflection of man’s glory.
046	1CO	011	008	For it was not man who was taken from woman, but woman who was taken from man.
046	1CO	011	009	Besides, man was not created for the sake of woman, but woman for the sake of man.
046	1CO	011	010	And, therefore, a woman ought to wear on her head a symbol of her subjection, because of the presence of the angels.
046	1CO	011	011	Still, when in union with the Lord, woman is not independent of man, or man of woman;
046	1CO	011	012	for just as woman came from man, so man comes by means of woman; and all things come from God.
046	1CO	011	013	Judge for yourselves. Is it fitting that a woman should pray to God in public with her head uncovered?
046	1CO	011	014	Does not nature herself teach us that, while for a man to wear his hair long is degrading to him,
046	1CO	011	015	a woman’s long hair is her glory? Her hair has been given her to serve as a covering.
046	1CO	011	016	If, however, anyone still thinks it right to contest the point – well, we have no such custom, nor have the churches of God.
046	1CO	011	017	In giving directions on the next subject, I cannot praise you; because your meetings do more harm than good.
046	1CO	011	018	To begin with, I am told that when you meet together as a church there are divisions among you. In part I believe this,
046	1CO	011	019	indeed, there must be parties among you, so that the people of real worth become known.
046	1CO	011	020	When you meet together, as I understand, it is not possible to eat the Lord’s Supper;
046	1CO	011	021	for, as you eat, each of you tries to secure his own supper first, with the result that one has too little to eat, and another has too much to drink!
046	1CO	011	022	Have you no houses in which you can eat and drink? Or are you trying to show your contempt for the church of God, and to humiliate the poor? What can I say to you? Should I praise you? In this matter I cannot praise you.
046	1CO	011	023	For I myself received from the Lord the account which I have in turn given to you – how the Lord Jesus, on the very night of his betrayal, took some bread,
046	1CO	011	024	and, after saying the thanksgiving, broke it and said ‘This is my own body given on your behalf. Do this in memory of me.’
046	1CO	011	025	And in the same way with the cup, after supper, saying ‘This cup is the new covenant made by my blood. Do this, whenever you drink it, in memory of me.’
046	1CO	011	026	For whenever you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death – until he comes.
046	1CO	011	027	Therefore, whoever eats the bread, or drinks the Lord’s cup, in an irreverent spirit, will have to answer for an offence against the Lord’s body and blood.
046	1CO	011	028	Let everyone look into their own heart, and only then eat of the bread and drink from the cup.
046	1CO	011	029	For the person who eats and drinks brings a judgment on themselves by their eating and drinking, when they do not discern the body.
046	1CO	011	030	That is why so many among you are weak and ill, and why some are sleeping.
046	1CO	011	031	But, if we judged ourselves rightly, we should not be judged.
046	1CO	011	032	Yet, in being judged by the Lord, we are undergoing discipline, so that we may not have judgment passed on us with the rest of the world.
046	1CO	011	033	Therefore, my friends, when you meet together to eat the Supper, wait for one another.
046	1CO	011	034	If anyone is hungry, they should eat at home, so that your meetings may not bring a judgment on you. The other details I will settle when I come.
046	1CO	012	001	In the next place, friends, I do not want you to be ignorant about spiritual gifts.
046	1CO	012	002	You know that there was a time when you were Gentiles, going astray after idols that could not speak, just as you happened to be led.
046	1CO	012	003	Therefore I tell you plainly that no one who speaks under the influence of the Spirit of God says “JESUS IS ACCURSED,” and that no one can say “JESUS IS LORD,” except under the influence of the Holy Spirit.
046	1CO	012	004	Gifts differ, but the Spirit is the same;
046	1CO	012	005	ways of serving differ, yet the Master is the same;
046	1CO	012	006	results differ, yet the God who brings about every result is in every case the same.
046	1CO	012	007	To each of us there is given spiritual illumination for the general good.
046	1CO	012	008	To one is given the power to speak with wisdom through the Spirit; to another the power to speak with knowledge, due to the same Spirit;
046	1CO	012	009	to another faith by the same Spirit; to another power to cure diseases by the one Spirit; to another supernatural powers;
046	1CO	012	010	to another the gift of preaching; to another the gift of distinguishing between true and false inspiration; to another varieties of the gift of “tongues”; to another the power to interpret “tongues.”
046	1CO	012	011	All these result from one and the same Spirit, who distributes his gifts to each individually as he wills.
046	1CO	012	012	For just as the human body is one whole, and yet has many parts, and all its parts, many though they are, form but one body, so it is with the Christ;
046	1CO	012	013	for it was by one Spirit that we were all baptised to form one body, whether Jews or Greeks, slaves or free, and were all imbued with one Spirit.
046	1CO	012	014	The human body, I repeat, consists not of one part, but of many.
046	1CO	012	015	If the foot says “Since I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body,” it does not because of that cease to belong to the body.
046	1CO	012	016	Or if the ear says “Since I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body,” it does not because of that cease to belong to the body.
046	1CO	012	017	If all the body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If it were all hearing, where would the sense of smell be?
046	1CO	012	018	But in fact God has placed each individual part just where he thought fit in the body.
046	1CO	012	019	If, however, they all made up only one part, where would the body be?
046	1CO	012	020	But in fact, although it has many parts, there is only one body.
046	1CO	012	021	The eye cannot say to the hand “I do not need you,” nor, again, the head to the feet “I do not need you.”
046	1CO	012	022	No! Those parts of the body that seem naturally the weaker are indispensable;
046	1CO	012	023	and those parts which we deem less honourable we surround with special honour; and our ungraceful parts receive a special grace which our graceful parts do not require.
046	1CO	012	024	Yes, God has so constructed the body – by giving a special honour to the part that lacks it –
046	1CO	012	025	As to secure that there should be no disunion in the body, but that the parts should show the same care for one another.
046	1CO	012	026	If one part suffers, all the others suffer with it, and if one part has honour done to it, all the others share its joy.
046	1CO	012	027	Together you are the body of Christ, and individually its parts.
046	1CO	012	028	In the church God has appointed, first, apostles, secondly preachers, thirdly teachers; then he has given supernatural powers, then power to cure diseases, aptness for helping others, capacity to govern, varieties of the gift of “tongues.”
046	1CO	012	029	Can everyone be an apostle? Can everyone be a preacher? Can everyone be a teacher? Can everyone have supernatural powers?
046	1CO	012	030	Can everyone have power to cure diseases? Can everyone speak in “tongues”? Can everyone interpret them?
046	1CO	012	031	Strive for the greater gifts. Yet I can still show you a way beyond all comparison the best.
046	1CO	013	001	Though I speak in the “tongues” of people, or even of angels, yet have not love, I have become mere echoing brass, or a clanging cymbal!
046	1CO	013	002	Even though I have the gift of preaching, and fathom all hidden truths and all the depths of knowledge; even though I have such faith as might move mountains, yet have not love, I am nothing!
046	1CO	013	003	Even though I dole my substance to the poor, even though I sacrifice my body in order to boast, yet have not love, it avails me nothing!
046	1CO	013	004	Love is long-suffering, and kind; love is never envious, never boastful, never conceited, never behaves unbecomingly;
046	1CO	013	005	love is never self-seeking, never provoked, never reckons up her wrongs;
046	1CO	013	006	love never rejoices at evil, but rejoices in the triumph of truth;
046	1CO	013	007	love bears with all things, ever trustful, ever hopeful, ever patient.
046	1CO	013	008	Love never fails. But, whether it be the gift of preaching, it will end; whether it be the gift of “tongues,” it will cease; whether it be knowledge, it, too, will vanish.
046	1CO	013	009	For our knowledge is incomplete, and our preaching is incomplete,
046	1CO	013	010	but, when the perfect has come, that which is incomplete will end.
046	1CO	013	011	When I was a child, I talked as a child, I felt as a child, I reasoned as a child; now that I am a man, I have done with childish ways.
046	1CO	013	012	As yet we see, in a mirror, dimly, but then – face to face! As yet my knowledge is incomplete, but then I will know in full, as I have been fully known.
046	1CO	013	013	Meanwhile faith, hope, and love endure – these three, but the greatest of these is love.
046	1CO	014	001	Seek this love earnestly, and strive for spiritual gifts, above all for the gift of preaching.
046	1CO	014	002	The person who, when speaking, uses the gift of “tongues” is speaking, not to people, but to God, for no one understands them; yet in spirit they are speaking of hidden truths.
046	1CO	014	003	But those who preach are speaking to their fellow men and women words that will build up faith, and give them comfort and encouragement.
046	1CO	014	004	Those who, when speaking, use the gift of “tongues” builds up their own faith, while those who preach build up the faith of the church.
046	1CO	014	005	Now I want you all to speak in “tongues,” but much more I wish that you should preach. A preacher is worth more than one who speaks in “tongues,” unless they interprets their words, so that the faith of the church may be built up.
046	1CO	014	006	This being so, friends, what good will I do you, if I come to you and speak in “tongues,” unless my words convey some revelation, or knowledge, or take the form of preaching or teaching?
046	1CO	014	007	Even with inanimate things, such as a flute or a harp, though they produce sounds, yet unless the notes are quite distinct, how can the tune played on the flute or the harp be recognised?
046	1CO	014	008	If the bugle sounds a doubtful call, who will prepare for battle?
046	1CO	014	009	And so with you; unless, in using the gift of “tongues,” you utter intelligible words, how can what you say be understood? You will be speaking to the winds!
046	1CO	014	010	There are, for instance, a certain number of different languages in the world, and not one of them fails to convey meaning.
046	1CO	014	011	If, however, I do not happen to know the language, I will be a foreigner to those who speak it, and they will be foreigners to me.
046	1CO	014	012	And so with you; since you are striving for spiritual gifts, be eager to excel in such as will build up the faith of the church.
046	1CO	014	013	Therefore anyone who, when speaking, uses the gift of “tongues” should pray for ability to interpret them.
046	1CO	014	014	If, when praying, I use the gift of “tongues,” my spirit indeed prays, but my mind is a blank.
046	1CO	014	015	What, then, is my conclusion? Simply this – I will pray with my spirit, but with my mind as well; I will sing with my spirit, but with my mind as well.
046	1CO	014	016	If you bless God with your spirit only, how can people in the congregation who are without your gift say “Amen” to your thanksgiving? They do not know what you are saying!
046	1CO	014	017	Your thanksgiving may be excellent, but the other is not helped by it.
046	1CO	014	018	Thank God, I use the gift of “tongues” more than any of you.
046	1CO	014	019	But at a meeting of the church I would rather speak five words with my mind, and so teach others, than ten thousand words when using the gift of “tongues.”
046	1CO	014	020	My friends, do not show yourselves children in understanding. In wickedness be infants, but in understanding show yourselves adults.
046	1CO	014	021	It is said in the Law – “In strange tongues and by the lips of strangers will I speak to this people, but even then they will not listen to me, says the Lord.”
046	1CO	014	022	Therefore the gift of the “tongues” is intended as a sign, not for those who believe in Christ, but for those who do not, while the gift of preaching is intended as a sign, not for those who do not believe in Christ, but for those who do.
046	1CO	014	023	So, when the whole church meets, if all present use the gift of “tongues,” and some people who are without the gift, or who are unbelievers, come in, will not they say that you are mad?
046	1CO	014	024	While, if all those present use the gift of preaching, and an unbeliever, or someone without the gift, comes in, they are convinced of their sinfulness by them all, they are called to account by them all;
046	1CO	014	025	the secrets of their heart are revealed, and then, throwing themselves on their face, they will worship God, and declare “God is indeed among you!”
046	1CO	014	026	What do I suggest, then, friends? Whenever you meet for worship, each of you comes, either with a hymn, or a lesson, or a revelation, or the gift of “tongues,” or the interpretation of them; let everything be directed to the building up of faith.
046	1CO	014	027	If any of you use the gift of “tongues,” not more than two, or at the most three, should do so – each speaking in his turn – and someone should interpret them.
046	1CO	014	028	If there is no one able to interpret what is said, they should remain silent at the meeting of the church, and speak to themselves and to God.
046	1CO	014	029	Of preachers two or three should speak, and the rest should weigh well what is said.
046	1CO	014	030	But, if some revelation is made to another person as he sits there, the first speaker should stop.
046	1CO	014	031	For you can all preach in turn, so that all may learn some lesson and all receive encouragement.
046	1CO	014	032	(The spirit that moves the preachers is within the preachers’ control;
046	1CO	014	033	for God is not a God of disorder, but of peace.) This custom prevails in all the churches of Christ’s people.
046	1CO	014	034	At the meetings of the church married women should remain silent, for they are not allowed to speak in public; they should take a subordinate place, as the Law itself directs.
046	1CO	014	035	If they want information on any point, they should ask their husbands about it at home; for it is unbecoming for a married woman to speak at a meeting of the church.
046	1CO	014	036	What! Did God’s message to the world originate with you? Or did it find its way to none but you?
046	1CO	014	037	If anyone thinks that he has the gift of preaching or any other spiritual gift, he should recognise that what I am now saying to you is a command from the Lord.
046	1CO	014	038	Anyone who ignores it may be ignored.
046	1CO	014	039	Therefore, my friends, strive for the gift of preaching, and yet do not forbid speaking in “tongues.”
046	1CO	014	040	Let everything be done in a proper and orderly manner.
046	1CO	015	001	Next, friends, I would like to remind you of the good news which I told you, and which you received – the good news on which you have taken your stand,
046	1CO	015	002	and by means of which you are being saved. I would like to remind you of the words that I used in telling it to you, since you are still holding fast to it, and since it was not in vain that you became believers in Christ.
046	1CO	015	003	For at the very beginning of my teaching I gave you the account which I had myself received – that Christ died for our sins (as the scriptures had foretold),
046	1CO	015	004	that he was buried, that on the third day he was raised (as the scriptures had foretold),
046	1CO	015	005	and that he appeared to Cephas, and then to the Twelve.
046	1CO	015	006	After that, he appeared to more than five hundred of his followers at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have gone to their rest.
046	1CO	015	007	After that, he appeared to James, and then to all the apostles.
046	1CO	015	008	Last of all, he appeared even to me, who am, as it were, a miscarried baby – born untimely.
046	1CO	015	009	For I am the least of the apostles, I who am unworthy of the name of “apostle,” because I persecuted the church of God.
046	1CO	015	010	But it is through the love of God that I am what I am, and the love that he showed me has not been wasted. No, I have toiled harder than any of them, and yet it was not I, but the love of God working with me.
046	1CO	015	011	Whether, then, it was I or whether it was they, this we proclaim, and this you believed.
046	1CO	015	012	Now, if it is proclaimed of Christ that he has been raised from the dead, how is it that some of you say that there is no such thing as a resurrection of the dead?
046	1CO	015	013	But, if there is no such thing as a resurrection of the dead, then even Christ has not been raised;
046	1CO	015	014	and, if Christ has not been raised, then our proclamation is without meaning, and our faith without meaning also!
046	1CO	015	015	Yes, and we are being proved to have borne false testimony about God; for we testified of God that he raised the Christ, whom he did not raise, if, indeed, the dead do not rise!
046	1CO	015	016	For, if the dead do not rise, then even Christ himself has not been raised,
046	1CO	015	017	and, if Christ has not been raised, your faith is folly – your sins are on you still!
046	1CO	015	018	Yes, and they, who have passed to their rest in union with Christ, perished!
046	1CO	015	019	If all that we have done has been to place our hope in Christ for this life, then we of all people are the most to be pitied.
046	1CO	015	020	But, in truth, Christ has been raised from the dead, the first-fruits of those who are at rest.
046	1CO	015	021	For, since through a man there is death, so, too, through a man there is a resurrection of the dead.
046	1CO	015	022	For, as through union with Adam all die, so through union with the Christ will all be made to live.
046	1CO	015	023	But each in their proper order – Christ the first-fruits; afterwards, at his coming, those who belong to the Christ.
046	1CO	015	024	Then will come the end – when he surrenders the kingdom to his God and Father, having overthrown all other rule and all other authority and power.
046	1CO	015	025	For he must reign until God “has put all his enemies under his feet.”
046	1CO	015	026	The last enemy to be overthrown is death;
046	1CO	015	027	for God has placed all things under Christ’s feet. (But, when it is said that all things have been placed under Christ, it is plain that God is excepted who placed everything under him.)
046	1CO	015	028	And, when everything has been placed under him, the Son will place himself under God who placed everything under him, so that God may be all in all!
046	1CO	015	029	Again, what good will they be doing who are baptised on behalf of the dead? If it is true that the dead do not rise, why are people baptised on their behalf?
046	1CO	015	030	Why, too, do we risk our lives every hour?
046	1CO	015	031	Daily I face death – I swear it, friends, by the pride in you that I feel through my union with Christ Jesus, our Lord.
046	1CO	015	032	If with only human hopes I had fought in the arena at Ephesus, what should I have gained by it? If the dead do not rise, then let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we will die!
046	1CO	015	033	Do not be deceived. “Good character is marred by evil company.”
046	1CO	015	034	Wake up to a righteous life, and cease to sin. There are some who have no true knowledge of God. I speak in this way to shame you.
046	1CO	015	035	Someone, however, may ask “How do the dead rise? And in what body will they come?”
046	1CO	015	036	You foolish person! The seed you yourself sow does not come to life, unless it dies!
046	1CO	015	037	And when you sow, you sow not the body that will be, but a mere grain – perhaps of wheat, or something else.
046	1CO	015	038	God gives it the body that he pleases – to each seed its special body.
046	1CO	015	039	All forms of life are not the same; there is one for people, another for beasts, another for birds, and another for fish.
046	1CO	015	040	There are heavenly bodies, and earthly bodies; but the beauty of the heavenly bodies is not the beauty of the earthly.
046	1CO	015	041	There is a beauty of the sun, and a beauty of the moon, and a beauty of the stars; for even star differs from star in beauty.
046	1CO	015	042	It is the same with the resurrection of the dead. Sown a mortal body, it rises immortal; sown disfigured, it rises beautiful;
046	1CO	015	043	sown weak, it rises strong; sown a human body, it rises a spiritual body.
046	1CO	015	044	As surely as there is a human body, there is also a spiritual body.
046	1CO	015	045	That is what is meant by the words – “Adam, the first man, became a human being”; the last Adam became a life-giving spirit.
046	1CO	015	046	That which comes first is not the spiritual, but the human; afterwards comes the spiritual;
046	1CO	015	047	the first man was from the dust of the earth; the second man from heaven.
046	1CO	015	048	Those who are of the dust are like him who came from the dust; and those who are of heaven are like him who came from heaven.
046	1CO	015	049	And as we have borne the likeness of him who came from the dust, so let us bear the likeness of him who came from heaven.
046	1CO	015	050	This I say, friends – Flesh and blood can have no share in the kingdom of God, nor can the perishable share the imperishable.
046	1CO	015	051	Listen, I will tell you God’s hidden purpose! We will not all have passed to our rest, but we will all be transformed – in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye,
046	1CO	015	052	at the last trumpet-call; for the trumpet will sound, and the dead will rise immortal, and we, also, will be transformed.
046	1CO	015	053	For this perishable body of ours must put on an imperishable form, and this dying body a deathless form.
046	1CO	015	054	And, when this dying body has put on its deathless form, then indeed will the words of scripture come true –
046	1CO	015	055	“death has been swallowed up in victory! Where, Death, is your victory? Where, death, is your sting?”
046	1CO	015	056	It is sin that gives death its sting, and it is the Law that gives sin its power.
046	1CO	015	057	But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory, through Jesus Christ, our Lord.
046	1CO	015	058	Therefore, my dear friends, stand firm, unshaken, always diligent in the Lord’s work, for you know that, in union with him, your toil is not in vain.
046	1CO	016	001	With reference to the collection for Christ’s people, I want you to follow the instructions that I gave to the churches in Galatia.
046	1CO	016	002	On the first day of every week each of you should put by what he can afford, so that no collections need be made after I have come.
046	1CO	016	003	On my arrival, I will send any persons, whom you may authorise by letter, to carry your gift to Jerusalem;
046	1CO	016	004	and, if it appears to be worth while for me to go also, they will go with me.
046	1CO	016	005	I will come to you as soon as I have been through Macedonia – for I am going through Macedonia –
046	1CO	016	006	And I will probably make some stay with you or, perhaps, remain for the winter, so that you may yourselves send me on my way, wherever I may be going.
046	1CO	016	007	I do not propose to pay you a visit in passing now, for I hope to stay with you for some time, if the Lord permits.
046	1CO	016	008	I intend, however, staying at Ephesus until the Festival at the close of the Harvest;
046	1CO	016	009	for a great opening for active work has presented itself, and there are many opponents.
046	1CO	016	010	If Timothy comes, take care that he has no cause for feeling anxious while he is with you. He is doing the Master’s work no less than I am.
046	1CO	016	011	No one, therefore, should slight him. See him safely on his way to me, for I am expecting him with some of our friends.
046	1CO	016	012	As for our friend Apollos, I have often urged him to go to you with the others. He has, however, been very unwilling to do so as yet; but he will go as soon as he finds a good opportunity.
046	1CO	016	013	Be watchful; stand firm in your faith; be brave; be strong.
046	1CO	016	014	Let everything you do be done in a loving spirit.
046	1CO	016	015	I have another request to make of you, friends. You remember Stephanas and his household, and that they were the first-fruits gathered in from Greece, and set themselves to serve Christ’s people.
046	1CO	016	016	I want you, on your part, to show deference to such people as these, as well as to every fellow labourer and earnest worker.
046	1CO	016	017	I am glad Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus have come, for they have made up for your absence;
046	1CO	016	018	they have cheered my heart, and your hearts also. Recognise the worth of such people as these.
046	1CO	016	019	The churches in Roman Asia send you their greetings. Aquila and Prisca and the church that meets at their house send you many Christian greetings.
046	1CO	016	020	All of the Lord’s followers send you greetings. Greet one another with a sacred kiss.
046	1CO	016	021	I, Paul, add this greeting in my own handwriting.
046	1CO	016	022	Accursed be anyone who has no love for the Lord. THE LORD IS COMING.
046	1CO	016	023	May the blessing of the Lord Jesus be with you.
046	1CO	016	024	My love to all of you who are in union with Christ Jesus.

# BOOK	047	2CO	2 Corinthians	2 Corinthians
047	2CO	001	001	To the church of God in Corinth, and to all Christ’s people throughout Greece, from Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus, by the will of God, and from Timothy, who is also a follower.
047	2CO	001	002	May God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you and give you peace.
047	2CO	001	003	Blessed is the God and Father of Jesus Christ our Lord, the all-merciful Father, the God ever ready to console,
047	2CO	001	004	who consoles us in all our troubles, so that we may be able to console those who are in any trouble with the consolation that we ourselves receive from him.
047	2CO	001	005	It is true that we have our full share of the sufferings of the Christ, but through the Christ we have also our full share of consolation.
047	2CO	001	006	If we meet with trouble, it is for the sake of your consolation and salvation; and, if we find consolation, it is for the sake of the consolation that you will experience when you are called to endure the sufferings that we ourselves are enduring;
047	2CO	001	007	and our hope for you remains unshaken. We know that, as you are sharing our sufferings, you will also share our consolation.
047	2CO	001	008	We want you, friends, to know that, in the troubles which befell us in Roman Asia, we were burdened altogether beyond our strength, so much so that we even despaired of life.
047	2CO	001	009	Indeed, we had the presentiment that we must die, so that we might rely, not on ourselves, but on God who raises the dead.
047	2CO	001	010	And from so imminent a death God delivered us, and will deliver us again; for in him we have placed our hopes of future deliverance, while you, also, help us by your prayers.
047	2CO	001	011	And then many lips will give thanks on our behalf for the blessing granted us in answer to many prayers.
047	2CO	001	012	Indeed, our main ground for satisfaction is this – Our conscience tells us that our conduct in the world, and still more in our relations with you, was marked by a purity of motive and a sincerity that were inspired by God, and was based, not on worldly policy, but on the help of God.
047	2CO	001	013	We never write anything to you other than what you will acknowledge to the very end –
047	2CO	001	014	And, indeed, you have already partly acknowledged it about us – that you have a right to be proud of us, as we will be proud of you, on the day of our Lord Jesus.
047	2CO	001	015	With this conviction in my mind, I planned to come to see you first, so that your pleasure might be doubled –
047	2CO	001	016	To visit you both on my way to Macedonia, and to come to you again on my return from Macedonia, and then to get you to send me on my way into Judea.
047	2CO	001	017	As this was my plan, where, pray, did I show any fickleness of purpose? Or do you think that my plans are formed on mere impulse, so that in the same breath I say “Yes” and “No”?
047	2CO	001	018	As God is true, the message that we brought you does not waver between “Yes” and “No”!
047	2CO	001	019	The Son of God, Christ Jesus, whom we – Silas, Timothy, and I – proclaimed among you, never wavered between “Yes” and “No.” With him it has always been “Yes.”
047	2CO	001	020	For, many as were the promises of God, in Christ is the “Yes” that fulfils them. Therefore, through Christ again, let the “Amen” rise, through us, to the glory of God.
047	2CO	001	021	God who brings us, with you, into close union with Christ, and who consecrated us,
047	2CO	001	022	also set his seal on us, and gave us his Spirit in our hearts as a pledge of future blessings.
047	2CO	001	023	But, as my life will answer for it, I call God to witness that it was to spare you that I deferred my visit to Corinth.
047	2CO	001	024	I do not mean that we are to dictate to you with regard to your faith; on the contrary, we work with you for your true happiness; indeed, it is through your faith that you are standing firm.
047	2CO	002	001	For my own sake, as well, I decided not to pay you another painful visit.
047	2CO	002	002	If it is I who cause you pain, why, who is there to cheer me, except the person whom I am paining?
047	2CO	002	003	So I wrote as I did because I was afraid that if I had come, I should have been pained by those who ought to have made me glad; for I felt sure that it was true of you all that my joy was in every case yours also.
047	2CO	002	004	I wrote to you in sore trouble and distress of heart and with many tears, not to give you pain, but to let you see how intense a love I have for you.
047	2CO	002	005	Now whoever has caused the pain has not so much pained me, as he has, to some extent – not to be too severe – pained every one of you.
047	2CO	002	006	The man to whom I refer has been sufficiently punished by the penalty inflicted by the majority of you;
047	2CO	002	007	so that now you must take the opposite course, and forgive and encourage him, or else he may be overwhelmed by the intensity of his pain.
047	2CO	002	008	So I entreat you to assure him of your love.
047	2CO	002	009	I had this further object, also, in what I wrote – to find out whether you might be relied on to be obedient in everything.
047	2CO	002	010	Anyone you forgive, I forgive them, too. Indeed, for my part, whatever I have forgiven (if I have had to forgive anything), I have forgiven for your sakes, in the presence of Christ,
047	2CO	002	011	so as to prevent Satan from taking advantage of us; for we are not ignorant of his devices.
047	2CO	002	012	When I went to the district round Troas to tell the good news of the Christ, even though there was an opening for serving the Master,
047	2CO	002	013	I could get no peace of mind because I failed to find Titus, my friend; so I took leave of the people there, and went on to Macedonia.
047	2CO	002	014	All thanks to God, who, through our union with the Christ, leads us in one continual triumph, and uses us to spread the sweet perfume of the knowledge of him in every place.
047	2CO	002	015	For we are the fragrance of Christ ascending to God – both among those who are in the path of salvation and among those who are in the path to ruin.
047	2CO	002	016	To the latter we are a stench which arises from death and tells of death; to the former a fragrance which arises from life and tells of life. But who is equal to such a task?
047	2CO	002	017	Unlike many people, we are not in the habit of making profit out of God’s message; but in all sincerity, and bearing God’s commission, we speak before him in union with Christ.
047	2CO	003	001	Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or are we like some who need letters of commendation to you, or from you?
047	2CO	003	002	You yourselves are our letter – a letter written on our hearts, and one which everybody can read and understand.
047	2CO	003	003	All can see that you are a letter from Christ delivered by us, a letter written, not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone, but on tablets of human hearts.
047	2CO	003	004	This, then, is the confidence in regard to God that we have gained through the Christ.
047	2CO	003	005	I do not mean that we are fit to form any judgment by ourselves, as if on our own authority;
047	2CO	003	006	our fitness comes from God, who himself made us fit to be assistants of a new covenant, of which the substance is, not a written Law, but a Spirit. For the written Law means death, but the Spirit gives life.
047	2CO	003	007	If the system of religion which involved death, embodied in a written Law and engraved on stones, began amid such glory, that the Israelites were unable to gaze at the face of Moses because of its glory, though it was but a passing glory,
047	2CO	003	008	will not the religion that confers the Spirit have still greater glory?
047	2CO	003	009	For, if there was a glory in the religion that involved condemnation, far greater is the glory of the religion that confers righteousness!
047	2CO	003	010	Indeed, that which then had glory has lost its glory, because of the glory which surpasses it.
047	2CO	003	011	And, if that which was to pass away was attended with glory, far more will that which is to endure be surrounded with glory!
047	2CO	003	012	With such a hope as this, we speak with all plainness;
047	2CO	003	013	unlike Moses, who covered his face with a veil, to prevent the Israelites from gazing at the disappearance of what was passing away.
047	2CO	003	014	But their minds were slow to learn. Indeed, to this very day, at the public reading of the old covenant, the same veil remains; only for those who are in union with Christ does it pass away.
047	2CO	003	015	But, even to this day, whenever Moses is read, a veil lies on their hearts.
047	2CO	003	016	Yet, whenever someone turns to the Lord, the veil is removed.
047	2CO	003	017	And the Lord is the Spirit, and, where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.
047	2CO	003	018	And all of us, with faces from which the veil is lifted, seeing, as if reflected in a mirror, the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into his likeness, from glory to glory, as it is given by the Lord, the Spirit.
047	2CO	004	001	Therefore, since it is by God’s mercy that we are engaged in this ministry, we do not lose heart.
047	2CO	004	002	No, we have renounced the secrecy prompted by shame, refusing to adopt crafty ways, or to tamper with God’s message, and commending ourselves to everyone’s conscience, in the sight of God, by our exhibition of the truth.
047	2CO	004	003	And, even if the good news that we bring is veiled, it is veiled only in the case of those who are on the path to ruin –
047	2CO	004	004	people whose minds have been blinded by the God of this age, unbelievers as they are, so that the light from the good news of the glory of the Christ, who is the incarnation of God, should not shine for them.
047	2CO	004	005	(For it is not ourselves that we proclaim, but Christ Jesus, as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus’ sake.)
047	2CO	004	006	Indeed, the same God who said “Out of darkness light will shine,” has shone in on our hearts, so that we should bring out into the light the knowledge of the glory of God, seen in the face of Christ.
047	2CO	004	007	This treasure we have in these earthen vessels, so that its all-prevailing power may be seen to come from God, and not to be our own.
047	2CO	004	008	Though hard pressed on every side, we are never hemmed in; though perplexed, never driven to despair;
047	2CO	004	009	though pursued, never abandoned; though struck down, never killed!
047	2CO	004	010	We always bear on our bodies the marks of the death that Jesus died, so that the life also of Jesus may be exhibited in our bodies.
047	2CO	004	011	Indeed, we who still live are continually being given over to death for Jesus’ sake, so that the life also of Jesus may be exhibited in our mortal nature.
047	2CO	004	012	And so, while death is at work within us, life is at work within you.
047	2CO	004	013	But, in the same spirit of faith as that expressed in the words – “I believed, and therefore I spoke,” we, also believe, and therefore speak.
047	2CO	004	014	For we know that he who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with him, and will bring us, with you, into his presence.
047	2CO	004	015	For all this is for your sakes, so that the loving kindness of God, spreading from heart to heart, may cause yet more hearts to overflow with thanksgiving, to his glory.
047	2CO	004	016	Therefore, as I said, we do not lose heart. No, even though outwardly we are wasting away, yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day.
047	2CO	004	017	The light burden of our momentary trouble is preparing for us a weight of imperishable glory, beyond all measure.
047	2CO	004	018	We, all the while, gaze not on what is seen, but on what is unseen. For what is seen is transient, but what is unseen is imperishable.
047	2CO	005	001	For we know that if our tent – that earthly body which is now our home – is taken down, we have a house of God’s building, a home not made by hands, imperishable, in heaven.
047	2CO	005	002	Even while in our present body we sigh, longing to put over it our heavenly house,
047	2CO	005	003	sure that, when we have put it on, we will never be found naked.
047	2CO	005	004	For we who are in this tent sigh under our burden, unwilling to take it off, yet wishing to put our heavenly body over it, so that all that is mortal may be absorbed in life.
047	2CO	005	005	And he who has prepared us for this change is God, who has also given us his Spirit as a pledge.
047	2CO	005	006	Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, while our home is in the body, we are absent from our home with the Lord.
047	2CO	005	007	For we guide our lives by faith, and not by what we see.
047	2CO	005	008	And in this confidence we would gladly leave our home in the body, and make our home with the Lord.
047	2CO	005	009	Therefore, whether in our home or absent from our home, our one ambition is to please him.
047	2CO	005	010	For at the court of the Christ we must all appear in our true characters, so that each may reap the results of the life which he has lived in the body, in accordance with his actions – whether good or worthless.
047	2CO	005	011	Therefore, because we know the fear inspired by the Lord, it is true that we are trying to win people over, but our motives are plain to God; and I hope that in your inmost hearts they are plain to you also.
047	2CO	005	012	We are not ‘commending ourselves’ again to you, but rather are giving you cause for pride in us, so that you may have an answer ready for those who pride themselves on appearances and not on character.
047	2CO	005	013	For, if we were ‘beside ourselves,’ it was in God’s service! If we are not in our senses, it is in yours!
047	2CO	005	014	It is the love of the Christ which compels us, when we reflect that, as one died for all, therefore all died;
047	2CO	005	015	and that he died for all, so that the living should no longer live for themselves, but for him who died and rose for them.
047	2CO	005	016	For ourselves, then, from this time forward, we refuse to regard anyone from the world’s standpoint. Even if we once thought of Christ from the standpoint of the world, yet now we do so no longer.
047	2CO	005	017	Therefore, if anyone is in union with Christ, he is a new being! His old life has passed away; a new life has begun!
047	2CO	005	018	But all this is the work of God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ, and gave us the ministry of reconciliation –
047	2CO	005	019	To proclaim that God, in Christ, was reconciling the world to himself, not reckoning people’s offences against them, and that he had entrusted us with the message of this reconciliation.
047	2CO	005	020	It is, then, on Christ’s behalf that we are acting as ambassadors, God, as it were, appealing to you through us. We implore you on Christ’s behalf – Be reconciled to God.
047	2CO	005	021	For our sake God made Christ, who was innocent of sin, one with our sinfulness, so that in him we might be made one with the righteousness of God.
047	2CO	006	001	Therefore, as God’s fellow workers, we also appeal to you not to receive his loving kindness in vain.
047	2CO	006	002	For he says – “At the time for acceptance I listened to you, and on the day of deliverance I helped you.” Now is the time for acceptance! Now is the day of deliverance!
047	2CO	006	003	Never do we put an obstacle in anyone’s way, so that no fault may be found with our ministry.
047	2CO	006	004	No, we are trying to commend ourselves under all circumstances, as God’s assistants should – in many an hour of endurance, in troubles, in hardships, in difficulties,
047	2CO	006	005	in floggings, in imprisonments, in riots, in toils, in sleepless nights, in hunger;
047	2CO	006	006	by purity, by knowledge, by patience, by kindliness, by holiness of spirit, by unfeigned love;
047	2CO	006	007	by the message of truth, and by the power of God; by the weapons of righteousness in the right hand and in the left;
047	2CO	006	008	amid honour and disrepute, amid slander and praise; regarded as deceivers, yet proved to be true;
047	2CO	006	009	as unknown, yet well-known; as at death’s door, yet, see, we are living; as chastised, yet not killed;
047	2CO	006	010	as saddened, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet enriching many; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things!
047	2CO	006	011	We have been speaking freely to you, dear friends in Corinth; we have opened our heart;
047	2CO	006	012	there is room there for you, yet there is not room, in your love, for us.
047	2CO	006	013	Can you not in return – I appeal to you as I should to children – open your hearts to us?
047	2CO	006	014	Do not enter into inconsistent relations with those who reject the faith. For what partnership can there be between righteousness and lawlessness? Or what has light to do with darkness?
047	2CO	006	015	What harmony can there be between Christ and Belial? Or what can those who accept the faith have in common with those who reject it?
047	2CO	006	016	What agreement can there be between a temple of God and idols? And we are a temple of the living God. That is what God meant when he said – “I will live among them, and walk among them; and I will be their God, and they will be my people.
047	2CO	006	017	Therefore ‘Come out from among the nations, and separate yourselves from them,’ says the Lord, ‘And touch nothing impure; and I will welcome you;
047	2CO	006	018	and I will be a father to you, and you will be my sons and daughters,’ says the Lord, the Ruler of all.”
047	2CO	007	001	With these promises, dear friends, let us purify ourselves from everything that pollutes either body or spirit, and, in deepest respect for God, aim at perfect holiness.
047	2CO	007	002	Make room for us in your hearts. In no instance have we ever wronged, or harmed, or taken advantage of, anyone.
047	2CO	007	003	I am not saying this to condemn you. Indeed, I have already said that you are in our heart, to live and die together.
047	2CO	007	004	I have the utmost confidence in you; I am always boasting about you. I am full of encouragement and, in spite of all our troubles, my heart is overflowing with happiness.
047	2CO	007	005	Ever since we reached Macedonia, we have had no rest in body or mind; on every side there have been troubles – conflicts without, anxieties within.
047	2CO	007	006	But God, who encourages the downcast, has encouraged us by the arrival of Titus.
047	2CO	007	007	And it is not only by his arrival that we are encouraged, but also by the encouragement which he received from you; for he tells us of your strong affection, your penitence, and your zeal on my behalf – so that I am happier still.
047	2CO	007	008	For, though I caused you sorrow by my letter, I do not regret it. Even if I were inclined to regret it – for I see that my letter did cause you sorrow though only for a time –
047	2CO	007	009	I am glad now; not because of the sorrow it caused you, but because your sorrow brought you to repentance. For it was God’s will that you should feel sorrow, in order that you should not suffer loss in any way at our hands.
047	2CO	007	010	For, when sorrow is in accordance with God’s will, it results in a repentance leading to salvation, and which will never be regretted. The sure result of the sorrow that the world knows is death.
047	2CO	007	011	For see what results that other sorrow – sorrow in accordance with God’s will – has had in your case. What earnestness it produced! What explanations! What strong feeling! What alarm! What longing! What eagerness! What readiness to punish! You have proved yourselves altogether free from guilt in that matter.
047	2CO	007	012	So, then, even though I did write to you, it was not for the sake of the wrongdoer, or of the man who was wronged, but to make you conscious, in the sight of God, of your own earnest care for us. And it is this that has encouraged us.
047	2CO	007	013	In addition to the encouragement that this gave us, we were made far happier still by the happiness of Titus for his heart has been cheered by you all.
047	2CO	007	014	Although I have been boasting a little to him about you, you did not put me to shame; but, just as every thing we had said to you was true, so our boasting to Titus about you has also proved to be the truth.
047	2CO	007	015	And his affection for you is all the greater, as he remembers the deference that you all showed him, and recalls how you received him with anxious care.
047	2CO	007	016	I am glad that I can feel perfect confidence in you.
047	2CO	008	001	We want to remind you, friends, of the love that God has shown to the churches in Macedonia –
047	2CO	008	002	How, tired though they were by many a trouble, their overflowing happiness, and even their deep poverty, resulted in a flood of generosity.
047	2CO	008	003	I can bear witness that to the full extent of their power, and even beyond their power, spontaneously,
047	2CO	008	004	and with many an appeal to us for permission, they showed their love, and contributed their share towards the fund for their fellow Christians.
047	2CO	008	005	And that, not only in the way we had expected; but first they gave themselves to the Lord, and to us also, in accordance with God’s will.
047	2CO	008	006	And this led us to beg Titus, that since he had started the work for you, he should also see to the completion of this expression of your love.
047	2CO	008	007	And, remembering how you excel in everything – in faith, in teaching, in knowledge, in unfailing earnestness, and in the affection that we have awakened in you – I ask you to excel also in this expression of your love.
047	2CO	008	008	I am not laying a command on you, but I am making use of the earnestness shown by others to test the genuineness of your affection.
047	2CO	008	009	For you do not forget the loving kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ – how that for your sakes, although he was rich, he became poor, so that you also might become rich through his poverty.
047	2CO	008	010	I am only making suggestions on this matter; for this is the best course for you, since you were a year before others, not only in taking action, but also in showing your readiness to do so.
047	2CO	008	011	And now I want you to complete the work, so that its completion may correspond with your willing readiness – in proportion, of course, to your means.
047	2CO	008	012	For, where there is willingness, a person’s gift is valued by its comparison with what they have, and not with what they do not have.
047	2CO	008	013	For our object is not to give relief to others and bring distress on you. It is a matter of a fair balance.
047	2CO	008	014	On this occasion what you can spare will supply what they need, at another time what they can spare may supply your need, and so things will be equal.
047	2CO	008	015	As scripture says – “Those who had much had nothing over, and those who had little did not lack!”
047	2CO	008	016	I thank God for inspiring Titus with the same keen interest in your welfare that I have;
047	2CO	008	017	for Titus has responded to my appeals and, in his great earnestness, is starting to go to you of his own accord.
047	2CO	008	018	We are sending with him one of the Lord’s followers whose fame in the service of the good news has spread through all the churches;
047	2CO	008	019	and not only that, but he has been elected by the churches to accompany us on our journey, in connexion with this expression of your love, which we are personally administering to the honour of the Lord, and to show our deep interest.
047	2CO	008	020	What we are specially guarding against is that any fault should be found with us in regard to our administration of this charitable fund;
047	2CO	008	021	for we are trying to make arrangements which will be right, not only in the eyes of the Lord, but also in the eyes of people.
047	2CO	008	022	We are also sending with them another of our friends, whose earnestness we have many a time proved in many ways, and whom we now find made even more earnest by his great confidence in you.
047	2CO	008	023	If I must say anything about Titus, he is my intimate companion, and he shares my work for you; if it is our friends, they are delegates of the churches, an honour to Christ.
047	2CO	008	024	Show them, therefore – so that the churches may see it – the proof of your affection, and the ground for our boasting to them about you.
047	2CO	009	001	With reference, indeed, to the fund for your fellow Christians, it is quite superfluous for me to say anything to you.
047	2CO	009	002	I know, of course, your willingness to help, and I am always boasting of it to the Macedonians. I tell them that you in Greece have been ready for a year past; and it was really your zeal that stimulated most of them.
047	2CO	009	003	So my reason for sending our friends is to prevent what we said about you from proving, in this particular matter, an empty boast, and to enable you to be as well prepared as I have been saying that you are.
047	2CO	009	004	Otherwise, if any Macedonians were to come with me, and find you unprepared, we – to say nothing of you – should feel ashamed of our present confidence.
047	2CO	009	005	Therefore I think it necessary to beg the friends to go to you in advance, and to complete the arrangements for the gift, which you have already promised, so that it may be ready, as a gift, before I come, and not look as if it were being given under pressure.
047	2CO	009	006	Remember the saying – “Scanty sowing, scanty harvest; plentiful sowing, plentiful harvest.”
047	2CO	009	007	Let everyone give as he has determined before hand, not grudgingly or under compulsion; for God loves a cheerful giver.
047	2CO	009	008	God has power to shower all kinds of blessings on you, so that, having, under all circumstances and on all occasions, all that you can need, you may be able to shower all kinds of benefits on others.
047	2CO	009	009	(As scripture says – “He shared freely, he gave to the poor; his righteousness continues for ever.”
047	2CO	009	010	And he who supplies seed to the sower, and bread for eating, will supply you with seed, and cause it to increase, and will multiply the fruits of your righteousness).
047	2CO	009	011	Rich in all things yourselves, you will be able to show liberality to all, which, with our help, will cause thanksgiving to be offered to God.
047	2CO	009	012	For the rendering of a public service such as this, not only relieves the needs of your fellow Christians, but also results in the offering to God of many a thanksgiving.
047	2CO	009	013	Through the evidence afforded by the service rendered, you cause people to praise God for your fidelity to your profession of faith in the good news of the Christ, as well as for the liberality of your contributions for them and for all others.
047	2CO	009	014	And they also, in their prayers for you, express their longing to see you, because of the surpassing love of God displayed toward you.
047	2CO	009	015	All thanks to God for his inestimable gift!
047	2CO	010	001	Now, I, Paul, make a personal appeal to you by the meekness and gentleness of the Christ – I who, ‘in your presence, am humble in my bearing towards you, but, when absent, am bold in my language to you’ –
047	2CO	010	002	I implore you not to drive me to ‘show my boldness,’ when I do come, by the confident tone which I expect to have to adopt towards some of you, who are expecting to find us influenced in our conduct by earthly motives.
047	2CO	010	003	For, though we live an earthly life, we do not wage an earthly war.
047	2CO	010	004	The weapons for our warfare are not earthly, but, under God, are powerful enough to pull down strongholds.
047	2CO	010	005	We are engaged in confuting arguments and pulling down every barrier raised against the knowledge of God. We are taking captive every hostile thought, to bring it into submission to the Christ,
047	2CO	010	006	and are fully prepared to punish every act of rebellion, when once your submission is complete.
047	2CO	010	007	You look at the outward appearance of things! Let anyone, who is confident that he belongs to Christ, reflect, for himself, again on the fact – that we belong to Christ no less than he does.
047	2CO	010	008	Even if I boast extravagantly about our authority – which the Lord gave us for building up your faith and not for overthrowing it – still I have no reason to be ashamed.
047	2CO	010	009	I say this so that it doesn’t seem as if I am trying to overawe you by my letters.
047	2CO	010	010	For people say ‘His letters are impressive and vigorous, but his personal appearance is insignificant and his speaking contemptible.’
047	2CO	010	011	Let such a person be assured of this – that our words in our letters show us to be, when absent, just what our deeds will show us to be, when present.
047	2CO	010	012	We have not indeed the audacity to class or compare ourselves with some of those who indulge in self-commendation! But, when such persons measure themselves by themselves, and compare themselves with themselves, they show a want of wisdom.
047	2CO	010	013	We, however, will not give way to unlimited boasting, but will confine ourselves to the limits of the sphere to which God limited us, when he permitted us to come as far as Corinth.
047	2CO	010	014	For it is not the case, as it would be if we were not in the habit of coming to you, that we are exceeding our bounds! Why, we were the very first to reach you with the good news of the Christ!
047	2CO	010	015	Our boasting, therefore, is not unlimited, nor does it extend to the labours of others; but our hope is that, as your faith grows, our influence among you may be very greatly increased – though still confined to our sphere –
047	2CO	010	016	So that we will be able to tell the good news in the districts beyond you, without trespassing on the sphere assigned to others, or boasting of what has been already done.
047	2CO	010	017	Let anyone who boasts make their boast of the Lord.
047	2CO	010	018	For it is not those who commend themselves that stand the test, but those who are commended by the Lord.
047	2CO	011	001	I could wish that you would tolerate a little folly in me! But indeed you do tolerate me.
047	2CO	011	002	I am jealous over you with the jealousy of God. For I promised you in marriage as a pure bride, to one husband – the Christ.
047	2CO	011	003	Yet I fear that it may turn out that, just as the snake by his craftiness deceived Eve, so your minds may have lost the loyalty and purity due from you to the Christ.
047	2CO	011	004	For, if some newcomer is proclaiming a Jesus other than him whom we proclaimed, or if you are receiving a Spirit different from the Spirit which you received, or a good news different from that which you welcomed, then you are marvellously tolerant!
047	2CO	011	005	I do not regard myself as in any way inferior to the most eminent apostles!
047	2CO	011	006	Though I am no trained orator, yet I am not without knowledge; indeed we made this perfectly clear to you in every way.
047	2CO	011	007	Perhaps you say that I did wrong in humbling myself that you might be exalted – I mean because I told you God’s good news without payment.
047	2CO	011	008	I robbed other churches by taking pay from them, so that I might serve you!
047	2CO	011	009	And, when I was with you in need, I did not become a burden to any of you; for our friends, on coming from Macedonia, supplied my needs. I kept myself, and will keep myself from being an expense to you in any way.
047	2CO	011	010	As surely as I know anything of the truth of Christ, this boast, as far as I am concerned, will not be stopped in any part of Greece.
047	2CO	011	011	Why? Because I do not love you? God knows that I do!
047	2CO	011	012	What I am doing now I will continue to do in order to cut away the ground from under those who are wishing for some ground for attacking me, so that as regards the thing of which they boast they may appear in their true characters, just as we do.
047	2CO	011	013	Such people are false apostles, treacherous workers, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ!
047	2CO	011	014	And no wonder; for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light.
047	2CO	011	015	It is not surprising, therefore, if his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness. But their end will be in accordance with their actions.
047	2CO	011	016	I say again – Let no one think me a fool! Yet, if you do, at least welcome me as you would a fool, so that I, too may indulge in a little boasting.
047	2CO	011	017	When I speak like this, I am not speaking as the Master would, but as a fool might, in boasting so confidently.
047	2CO	011	018	As so many are boasting of earthly things, I, too, will boast.
047	2CO	011	019	For all your cleverness, you tolerate fools willingly enough!
047	2CO	011	020	You tolerate a person even when they enslave you, when they plunder you, when they get you into their power, when they put on airs of superiority, when they strike you in the face!
047	2CO	011	021	I admit, to my shame, that we have been weak. But whatever the subject on which others are not afraid to boast – though it is foolish to say so – I am not afraid either!
047	2CO	011	022	Are they Hebrews? So am I! Are they Israelites? So am I! Are they descendants of Abraham? So am I!
047	2CO	011	023	Are they “Servants of Christ”? Though it is madness to talk like this, I am more so than they! I have had more of toil, more of imprisonment! I have been flogged times without number. I have been often at death’s door.
047	2CO	011	024	Five times I received at the hands of my own people forty lashes, all but one.
047	2CO	011	025	Three times I was beaten with rods. Once I was stoned. Three times I was shipwrecked. I have spent a whole day and night in the deep.
047	2CO	011	026	My journeys have been many. I have been through dangers from rivers, dangers from robbers, dangers from my own people, dangers from the Gentiles, dangers in towns, dangers in the country, dangers on the sea, dangers among people pretending to be followers of the Lord.
047	2CO	011	027	I have been through toil and hardship. I have passed many a sleepless night; I have endured hunger and thirst; I have often been without food; I have known cold and nakedness.
047	2CO	011	028	And, not to speak of other things, there is my daily burden of anxiety about all the churches.
047	2CO	011	029	Who is weak without my being weak? Who is led astray without my burning with indignation?
047	2CO	011	030	If I must boast, I will boast of things which show my weakness!
047	2CO	011	031	The God and Father of the Lord Jesus – he who is for ever blessed – knows that I am speaking the truth.
047	2CO	011	032	When I was in Damascus, the Governor under King Aretas had the gates of that city guarded, so as to arrest me,
047	2CO	011	033	but I was let down in a basket through a window in the wall, and so escaped his hands.
047	2CO	012	001	I must boast! It is unprofitable; but I will pass to visions and revelations given by the Lord.
047	2CO	012	002	I know a man in union with Christ, who, fourteen years ago – whether in the body or out of the body I do not know; God knows – was caught up (this man of whom I am speaking) to the third heaven.
047	2CO	012	003	And I know that this man – whether in the body or separated from the body I do not know; God knows –
047	2CO	012	004	Was caught up into Paradise, and heard unspeakable things of which no human being may tell.
047	2CO	012	005	About such a man I will boast, but about myself I will not boast except as regards my weaknesses.
047	2CO	012	006	Yet if I choose to boast, I will not be a fool; for I will be speaking no more than the truth. But I refrain, in case anyone should credit me with more than he can see in me or hear from me, and because of the marvellous character of the revelations.
047	2CO	012	007	It was for this reason, and to prevent my thinking too highly of myself, that a thorn was sent to pierce my flesh – an instrument of Satan to discipline me – so that I should not think too highly of myself.
047	2CO	012	008	About this I three times entreated the Lord, praying that it might leave me.
047	2CO	012	009	But his reply has been – “My help is enough for you; for my strength attains its perfection in the midst of weakness.” Most gladly, then, will I boast all the more of my weaknesses, so that the strength of the Christ may overshadow me.
047	2CO	012	010	That is why I delight in weakness, ill treatment, hardship, persecution, and difficulties, when borne for Christ. For, when I am weak, then it is that I am strong!
047	2CO	012	011	I have been ‘playing the fool!’ It is you who drove me to it. For it is you who ought to have been commending me! Although I am nobody, in no respect did I prove inferior to the most eminent apostles.
047	2CO	012	012	The marks of the true apostle were exhibited among you in constant endurance, as well as by signs, by marvels, and by miracles.
047	2CO	012	013	In what respect, I ask, were you treated worse than the other churches, unless it was that, for my part, I refused to become a burden to you? Forgive me the wrong I did to you!
047	2CO	012	014	Remember, this is the third time that I have made every preparation to come to see you, and I will refuse to be a burden to you; I want, not your money, but you. It is not the duty of children to put by for their parents, but of parents to put by for their children.
047	2CO	012	015	For my part, I will most gladly spend, and be spent, for your welfare. Can it be that the more intensely I love you the less I am to be loved?
047	2CO	012	016	You will admit that I was not a burden to you but you say that I was ‘crafty’ and caught you ‘by a trick’!
047	2CO	012	017	Do you assert that I took advantage of you through any of those whom I have sent to you?
047	2CO	012	018	I urged Titus to go, and I sent another follower with him. Did Titus take any advantage of you? Didn’t we live in the same Spirit, and tread in the same footsteps?
047	2CO	012	019	Have you all this time been fancying that it is to you that we are making our defence? No, it is in the sight of God, and in union with Christ, that we are speaking. And all this, dear friends, is to build up your characters;
047	2CO	012	020	for I am afraid that perhaps, when I come, I may find that you are not what I want you to be, and, on the other hand, that you may find that I am what you do not want me to be. I am afraid that I may find quarrelling, jealousy, ill feeling, rivalry, slandering, backbiting, self-assertion, and disorder.
047	2CO	012	021	I am afraid that, on my next visit, my God may humble me in regard to you, and that I may have to mourn over many who have long been sinning, and have not repented of the impurity, immorality, and sensuality, in which they have indulged.
047	2CO	013	001	For the third time I am coming to see you. By the word of two or three witnesses each statement will be established.
047	2CO	013	002	I have said it, and I say it again before I come, just as if I were with you on my second visit, though for the moment absent, I say to those who have been long sinning, as well as to all others – that if I come again, I will spare no one.
047	2CO	013	003	And that will be the proof, which you are looking for, that the Christ speaks through me. There is no weakness in his dealings with you. No, he shows his power among you.
047	2CO	013	004	For though his crucifixion was due to weakness, his life is due to the power of God. And we, also, are weak in his weakness, but with him we will live for you through the power of God.
047	2CO	013	005	Put yourselves to the test, to see whether you are holding to the faith. Examine yourselves. Surely you recognise this fact about yourselves – that Jesus Christ is in you! Unless indeed you cannot stand the test!
047	2CO	013	006	But I hope that you will recognise that we can stand the test.
047	2CO	013	007	We pray to God that you may do nothing wrong, not that we may be seen to stand the test, but that you may do what is right, even though we may seem not to stand the test.
047	2CO	013	008	We have no power at all against the truth, but we have power in the service of the truth.
047	2CO	013	009	We are glad when we are weak, if you are strong. And what we pray for is that you may become perfect.
047	2CO	013	010	This is my reason for writing as I am now doing, while I am away from you, so that, when I am with you, I may not act harshly in the exercise of the authority which the Lord gave me – and gave me for building up and not for pulling down.
047	2CO	013	011	And now, friends, goodbye. Aim at perfection; take courage; agree together; live in peace. And then God, the source of all love and peace, will be with you.
047	2CO	013	012	Greet one another with a sacred kiss.
047	2CO	013	013	All Christ’s people here send you their greetings.
047	2CO	013	014	May the blessing of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion with the Holy Spirit, be with you all.

# BOOK	048	GAL	Galatians	Galatians
048	GAL	001	001	To the churches in Galatia, from Paul, an apostle whose commission is not from any human authority and is given, not by human beings, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised him from the dead;
048	GAL	001	002	and from all the followers of the Lord here.
048	GAL	001	003	May God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ, bless you and give you peace.
048	GAL	001	004	For Christ, to rescue us from this present wicked age, gave himself for our sins, in accordance with the will of our God and Father,
048	GAL	001	005	to whom be ascribed all glory for ever and ever. Amen.
048	GAL	001	006	I am astonished at your so soon deserting him, who called you through the love of Christ, for a different “good news,”
048	GAL	001	007	which is really no good news at all. But then, I know that there are people who are harassing you, and who want to pervert the good news of the Christ.
048	GAL	001	008	Yet even if we – or if an angel from heaven were to tell you any other “good news” than that which we told you, may he be accursed!
048	GAL	001	009	We have said it before, and I repeat it now – If anyone tells you a “good news” other than that which you received, may he be accursed!
048	GAL	001	010	Is this, I ask, trying to conciliate people, or God? Am I seeking to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I should not be a servant of Christ.
048	GAL	001	011	I remind you, friends, that the good news which I told is no mere human invention.
048	GAL	001	012	I, at least, did not receive it from any human being, nor was I taught it, but it came to me through a revelation made by Jesus Christ.
048	GAL	001	013	You heard, no doubt, of my conduct when I was devoted to Judaism – how I persecuted the church of God to an extent beyond belief, and tried to destroy it,
048	GAL	001	014	and how, in my devotion to Judaism, I surpassed many of my contemporaries among my own people in my intense earnestness in upholding the traditions of my ancestors.
048	GAL	001	015	But when God, who had set me apart even before my birth, and who called me by his love,
048	GAL	001	016	saw fit to reveal his Son in me, so that I might tell the good news of him among the Gentiles, then at once, instead of consulting any human being,
048	GAL	001	017	or even going up to Jerusalem to see those who were apostles before me, I went to Arabia, and came back again to Damascus.
048	GAL	001	018	Three years afterwards I went up to Jerusalem to make the acquaintance of Peter, and I stayed a fortnight with him.
048	GAL	001	019	I did not, however, see any other apostle, except James, the Master’s brother.
048	GAL	001	020	(As to what I am now writing to you, I call God to witness that I am speaking the truth).
048	GAL	001	021	Afterwards I went to the districts of Syria and Cilicia.
048	GAL	001	022	But I was still unknown even by sight to the Christian churches in Judea;
048	GAL	001	023	all that they had heard was – “The man who once persecuted us is now telling the good news of the faith of which he once tried to destroy.”
048	GAL	001	024	And they praised God for my sake.
048	GAL	002	001	Fourteen years afterwards I went up to Jerusalem again with Barnabas, and I took Titus also with me.
048	GAL	002	002	It was in obedience to a revelation that I went; and I laid before the apostles the good news that I am proclaiming among the Gentiles. I did this privately before those who are thought highly of because I was afraid that I might possibly be taking, or might have already taken, a course which would prove useless.
048	GAL	002	003	Yet even my companion, Titus, though a Greek, was not compelled to be circumcised.
048	GAL	002	004	But, because of those who pretended to be followers who had stolen in, the intruders who had crept in to spy on the liberty which we have through union with Christ Jesus, in order to bring us back to slavery –
048	GAL	002	005	Why, we did not for a moment yield submission to them, so that the truth of the good news might be yours always!
048	GAL	002	006	Of those who are thought somewhat highly of – what they once were makes no difference to me; God does not recognise human distinctions – those, I say, who are thought highly of added nothing to my message.
048	GAL	002	007	On the contrary, they saw that I had been entrusted with the good news for the Gentiles, just as Peter had been for the Jews.
048	GAL	002	008	For he who gave Peter power for his mission to the Jews gave me, also, power to go to the Gentiles.
048	GAL	002	009	Recognising the charge entrusted to me, James, Peter, and John, who were regarded as pillars of the church, openly acknowledged Barnabas and me as fellow workers, agreeing that we should go to the Gentiles, and they to the Jews.
048	GAL	002	010	Only we were to remember the poor – the thing I was myself anxious to do.
048	GAL	002	011	But, when Peter came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face; for he stood self-condemned.
048	GAL	002	012	Before certain persons came from James, he had been in the habit of eating with the Gentile converts; but, when they came, he began to withdraw and hold aloof, because he was afraid of offending those who still held to circumcision.
048	GAL	002	013	The rest of the Jewish converts were guilty of the same hypocrisy, so that even Barnabas was led away by it.
048	GAL	002	014	But, when I saw that they were not dealing straightforwardly with the truth of the good news, I said to Peter, before them all, ‘If you, who were born a Jew, adopt Gentile customs, instead of Jewish, why are you trying to compel the Gentile converts to adopt Jewish customs?’
048	GAL	002	015	We, though we are Jews by birth and not sinners of Gentile origin, know that no one is pronounced righteous as the result of obedience to Law, but only through faith in Christ Jesus.
048	GAL	002	016	So we placed our faith in Christ Jesus, in order that we might be pronounced righteous, as the result of faith in Christ, and not of obedience to Law; for such obedience will not result in even one soul’s being pronounced righteous.
048	GAL	002	017	If, while seeking to be pronounced righteous through union with Christ, we were ourselves seen to be sinners, would that make Christ an agent of sin? Heaven forbid!
048	GAL	002	018	For, if I rebuild the things that I pulled down, I prove myself to have done wrong.
048	GAL	002	019	I, indeed, through Law became dead to Law, in order to live for God.
048	GAL	002	020	I have been crucified with Christ. So it is no longer I that live, but it is Christ who lives in me; and, as for my present earthly life, I am living it by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.
048	GAL	002	021	I do not reject the love of God. If righteousness comes through Law, then there was no need for Christ to die!
048	GAL	003	001	Foolish Galatians! Who has been enchanting you – you before whose eyes Jesus Christ was depicted on the cross?
048	GAL	003	002	Here is the one thing that I want to find out from you – Did you receive the Spirit as the result of obedience to Law, or of your having listened with faith?
048	GAL	003	003	Can you be so foolish? After beginning with what is spiritual, do you now end with what is external?
048	GAL	003	004	Did you go through so much to no purpose? – if indeed it really was to no purpose!
048	GAL	003	005	He who supplies you abundantly with his Spirit and endows you with such powers – does he do this as the result of obedience to Law? Or as the result of your having listened with faith?
048	GAL	003	006	It is just as it was with Abraham – he had faith in God, and his faith was regarded by God as righteousness.
048	GAL	003	007	You see, then, that those whose lives are based on faith are the sons of Abraham.
048	GAL	003	008	And scripture, foreseeing that God would pronounce the Gentiles righteous as the result of faith, foretold the good news to Abraham in the words – “Through you all the Gentiles will be blessed.”
048	GAL	003	009	And, therefore, those whose lives are based on faith share the blessings bestowed on the faith of Abraham.
048	GAL	003	010	All who rely on obedience to Law are under a curse, for scripture says – “Cursed is everyone who does not abide by all that is written in the book of the Law, and do it.”
048	GAL	003	011	Again, it is evident that no one is pronounced righteous before God through Law, for we read – “Through faith the righteous will find life.”
048	GAL	003	012	But the Law is not based on faith; no, its words are – “Those who practice these precepts will find life through them.”
048	GAL	003	013	Christ ransomed us from the curse pronounced in the Law, by taking the curse on himself for us, for scripture says – “Cursed is anyone who is hanged on a tree.”
048	GAL	003	014	And this he did that the blessing given to Abraham might be extended to the Gentiles through their union with Jesus Christ; that so, through our faith, we also might receive the promised gift of the Spirit.
048	GAL	003	015	To take an illustration, friends, from daily life – No one sets aside even an agreement between two people, when once it has been confirmed, nor do they add conditions to it.
048	GAL	003	016	Now it was to Abraham that the promises were made, “and to his offspring.” It was not said “to his offsprings,” as if many persons were meant, but the words were “to your offspring,” showing that one person was meant – and that was Christ.
048	GAL	003	017	My point is this – An agreement already confirmed by God cannot be canceled by the Law, which came four hundred and thirty years later, so as to cause the promise to be set aside.
048	GAL	003	018	If our heritage is the result of Law, then it has ceased to be the result of a promise. Yet God conferred it on Abraham by a promise.
048	GAL	003	019	What, then, you ask, was the use of the Law? It was a later addition, to make people conscious of their wrongdoings, and intended to last only until the coming of that offspring to whom the promise had been made; and it was delivered through angels by a mediator.
048	GAL	003	020	Now mediation implies more than one person, but God is one only.
048	GAL	003	021	Does that set the Law in opposition to God’s promises? Heaven forbid! For, if a Law had been given capable of bestowing life, then righteousness would have actually owed its existence to Law.
048	GAL	003	022	But the words of scripture represent the whole world as being in bondage to sin, so that the promised blessing, dependent, as it is, on faith in Jesus Christ, may be given to those who have faith in him.
048	GAL	003	023	Before the coming of faith, we were kept under the guard of the Law, in bondage, awaiting the faith that was destined to be revealed.
048	GAL	003	024	Thus the Law has proved a guide to lead us to Christ, in order that we may be pronounced righteous as the result of faith.
048	GAL	003	025	But now that faith has come we no longer need a guide.
048	GAL	003	026	For you are all sons of God, through your faith in Christ Jesus.
048	GAL	003	027	For all of you who were baptised into union with Christ clothed yourselves with Christ.
048	GAL	003	028	All distinctions between Jew and Greek, slave and free, male and female, have vanished; for in union with Christ Jesus you are all one.
048	GAL	003	029	And, since you belong to Christ, it follows that you are Abraham’s offspring and, under the promise, sharers in the inheritance.
048	GAL	004	001	My point is this – as long as the heir is under age, there is no difference between him and a slave, though he is master of the whole estate.
048	GAL	004	002	He is subject to the control of guardians and stewards, during the period for which his father has power to appoint them.
048	GAL	004	003	And so is it with us; when we were under age, as it were, we were slaves to the puerile teaching of this world;
048	GAL	004	004	but, when the full time came, God sent his Son – born a woman’s child, born subject to Law –
048	GAL	004	005	to ransom those who were subject to Law, so that we might take our position as sons.
048	GAL	004	006	And it is because you are sons that God sent into our hearts the Spirit of his Son, with the cry – “Abba, our Father.”
048	GAL	004	007	You, therefore, are no longer a slave, but a son; and, if a son, then an heir also, by God’s appointment.
048	GAL	004	008	Yet formerly, in your ignorance of God, you became slaves to “gods” which were no gods.
048	GAL	004	009	But now that you have found God – or, rather, have been found by him – how is it that you are turning back to that poor and feeble puerile teaching, to which yet once again you are wanting to become slaves?
048	GAL	004	010	You are scrupulous in keeping days and months and seasons and years!
048	GAL	004	011	You make me fear that the labour which I have spent on you may have been wasted.
048	GAL	004	012	I entreat you, friends, to become like me, as I became like you. You have never done me any wrong.
048	GAL	004	013	You remember that it was owing to bodily infirmity that on the first occasion I told you the good news.
048	GAL	004	014	And as for what must have tried you in my condition, it did not inspire you with scorn or disgust, but you welcomed me as if I had been an angel of God – or Christ Jesus himself!
048	GAL	004	015	What has become then, of your blessings? For I can bear witness that, had it been possible, you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me!
048	GAL	004	016	Am I to think, then, that I have become your enemy by telling you the truth?
048	GAL	004	017	Certain people are seeking your favour, but with no honourable object. No, indeed, they want to isolate you, so that you will have to seek their favour.
048	GAL	004	018	It is always honourable to have your favour sought in an honourable cause, and not only when I am with you, my dear children –
048	GAL	004	019	you for whom I am again enduring a mother’s pains, until a likeness to Christ will have been formed in you.
048	GAL	004	020	But I could wish to be with you now and speak in a different tone, for I am perplexed about you.
048	GAL	004	021	Tell me, you who want to be still subject to Law – Why don’t you listen to the Law?
048	GAL	004	022	Scripture says that Abraham had two sons, one the child of the slave-woman and the other the child of the free woman.
048	GAL	004	023	But the child of the slave-woman was born in the course of nature, while the child of the free woman was born in fulfilment of a promise.
048	GAL	004	024	This story may be taken as an allegory. The women stand for two covenants. One covenant, given from Mount Sinai, produces a race of slaves and is represented by Hagar.
048	GAL	004	025	Hagar stands for Mount Sinai in Arabia, and represents the Jerusalem of today, for she and her children are in slavery.
048	GAL	004	026	But the Jerusalem above is free, and she it is who is our mother.
048	GAL	004	027	For scripture says – “Rejoice, you barren one, who have never given birth, break into shouts, you who are never in labour, for many are the children of her who is desolate – yes, more than of her who has a husband.”
048	GAL	004	028	As for ourselves, friends, we, like Isaac, are children born in fulfilment of a promise.
048	GAL	004	029	Yet at that time the child born in the course of nature persecuted the child born by the power of the Spirit; and it is the same now.
048	GAL	004	030	But what does the passage of scripture say? “Send away the slave-woman and her son; for the slave’s son will not be coheir with the son of the free woman.”
048	GAL	004	031	And so, friends, we are not children of a slave, but of her who is free.
048	GAL	005	001	It is for freedom that Christ set us free; stand firm therefore, and do not again be held under the yoke of slavery.
048	GAL	005	002	Understand that I, Paul, myself tell you that if you allow yourselves to be circumcised, Christ will avail you nothing.
048	GAL	005	003	I again declare to everyone who receives circumcision, that he binds himself to obey the whole Law.
048	GAL	005	004	You have severed yourselves from Christ – you who are seeking to be pronounced righteous through Law; you have fallen away from love.
048	GAL	005	005	For we, by the help of the Spirit, are eagerly waiting for the fulfilment of our hope – that we may be pronounced righteous as the result of faith.
048	GAL	005	006	If we are in union with Christ Jesus, neither is circumcision nor the omission of it anything, but faith, working through love, is everything.
048	GAL	005	007	You were once making good progress! Who has hindered you from obeying the truth?
048	GAL	005	008	The persuasion brought to bear on you does not come from him who calls you.
048	GAL	005	009	A little yeast leavens all the dough.
048	GAL	005	010	I, through my union with the Lord, am persuaded that you will learn to think with me. But the man who is disturbing your minds will have to bear his punishment, whoever he may be.
048	GAL	005	011	If I, friends, am still proclaiming circumcision, why am I still persecuted? It seems that the cross has ceased to be an obstacle!
048	GAL	005	012	I could even wish that the people who are unsettling you would go further still and mutilate themselves.
048	GAL	005	013	Remember, friends, to you the call came to give you freedom. Only, do not make your freedom an opportunity for self-indulgence but serve one another in a loving spirit.
048	GAL	005	014	Indeed, the whole Law has been summed up in this one precept – “You must love your neighbour as you love yourself.”
048	GAL	005	015	But, if you are continually wounding and preying on one another, take care that you are not destroyed by one another.
048	GAL	005	016	This is what I have to say – Let your steps be guided by the Spirit, and then you will never gratify the cravings of your earthly nature.
048	GAL	005	017	For these cravings of our earthly nature conflict with the Spirit, and the Spirit with our earthly nature – they are two contrary principles – so that you cannot do what you wish.
048	GAL	005	018	But, if you follow the guidance of the Spirit, you are not subject to Law.
048	GAL	005	019	The sins of our earthly nature are unmistakable. They are sins like these – sexual immorality, impurity, indecency,
048	GAL	005	020	idolatry, sorcery, quarrels, strife, jealousy, outbursts of passion, rivalries, dissensions, divisions,
048	GAL	005	021	feelings of envy, drunkenness, revelry, and the like. And I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who indulge in such things will have no place in the kingdom of God.
048	GAL	005	022	But the fruit produced by the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindliness, generosity, trustfulness, gentleness, self-control.
048	GAL	005	023	Against such things there is no law!
048	GAL	005	024	And those who belong to Jesus, the Christ, have already crucified their earthly nature, with its passions and its cravings.
048	GAL	005	025	Since our life is due to the Spirit, let us rule our conduct also by the Spirit.
048	GAL	005	026	Do not let us grow vain, and provoke or envy one another.
048	GAL	006	001	My friends, even if someone should be caught committing a sin, you who are spiritually minded should, in a gentle spirit, help them to recover themselves, taking care that you yourselves are not tempted.
048	GAL	006	002	Bear one another’s burdens, and so carry out the Law of the Christ.
048	GAL	006	003	If a person imagines themselves to be somebody, when they are really nobody, they deceive themselves.
048	GAL	006	004	Let everyone test their own work, and then their cause for satisfaction will be in themselves and not in a comparison with their neighbour;
048	GAL	006	005	for everyone must bear their own load.
048	GAL	006	006	The person, however, who is being instructed in the message ought always to share their blessings with their teacher.
048	GAL	006	007	Do not be deceived. God cannot be mocked. What a person sows that they will reap.
048	GAL	006	008	For the person who sows the field of their earthly nature will from that earthly nature reap corruption; while the one who sows the field of the spirit will from that spirit reap eternal life.
048	GAL	006	009	Let us never tire of doing right, for at the proper season we will reap our harvest, if we do not grow weary.
048	GAL	006	010	Therefore, I say, as the opportunity occurs, let us treat everyone with kindness, and especially members of the household of the faith.
048	GAL	006	011	See in what large letters I am writing with my own hand.
048	GAL	006	012	The people who are trying to compel you to be circumcised are the people who wish to appear to advantage in regard to outward observances. They do it only to avoid being persecuted for the cross of Jesus, the Christ
048	GAL	006	013	Even these men who are circumcised do not themselves keep the Law; yet they want you to be circumcised, so that they may boast of your observance of the rite.
048	GAL	006	014	But, for my part, may I never boast of anything except the cross of Jesus Christ, our Master, through whom the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.
048	GAL	006	015	For neither is circumcision nor the omission of it anything; but a new nature is everything.
048	GAL	006	016	May all who rule their conduct by this principle find peace and mercy – they who are the Israel of God.
048	GAL	006	017	For the future let no one trouble me; for I bear the marks of Jesus branded on my body.
048	GAL	006	018	May the blessing of Jesus Christ, our Lord, rest on your souls, friends. Amen.

# BOOK	049	EPH	Ephesians	Ephesians
049	EPH	001	001	To Christ’s people at Ephesus who are faithful to him, from Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus, by the will of God.
049	EPH	001	002	May God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you and give you peace.
049	EPH	001	003	Blessed is the God and Father of Jesus Christ, our Lord, who has blessed us on high with every spiritual blessing, in Christ.
049	EPH	001	004	For he chose us in our union with Christ before the creation of the universe, so that we might be holy and blameless in his sight, living in the spirit of love.
049	EPH	001	005	From the first he destined us, in his goodwill towards us, to be adopted as sons through Jesus Christ,
049	EPH	001	006	and so to enhance that glorious manifestation of his loving kindness which he gave us in the one he loves;
049	EPH	001	007	for in him, and through the shedding of his blood, we have found redemption in the pardon of our offences.
049	EPH	001	008	All this accords with the loving kindness which God lavished on us, accompanied by countless gifts of wisdom and discernment,
049	EPH	001	009	when he made known to us his hidden purpose. And it also accords with the goodwill which God purposed to exhibit in Christ,
049	EPH	001	010	in view of that divine order which was to mark the completion of the ages, when he should make everything, both in heaven and on earth, centre in him.
049	EPH	001	011	In him, I say, for by our union with him we became God’s heritage, having from the first been destined for this in the intention of him who, in all that happens, is carrying out his own fixed purpose;
049	EPH	001	012	that we should enhance his glory – we who have been the first to rest our hopes on the Christ.
049	EPH	001	013	And you, too, by your union with him, after you had heard the message of the truth, the good news of your salvation – you believed in him and were sealed as his by receiving the holy Spirit, which he had promised.
049	EPH	001	014	And the Spirit is a pledge of our future heritage, foreshadowing the full redemption of God’s own people – to enhance his glory.
049	EPH	001	015	And therefore I, ever since I heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which prevails among you, and of your confidence in all Christ’s people,
049	EPH	001	016	have never omitted to thank God on your behalf, whenever I make mention of you in my prayers.
049	EPH	001	017	My prayer is that the God of Jesus Christ our Lord, the all-glorious Father, may inspire you with wisdom and true insight through a fuller knowledge of himself;
049	EPH	001	018	that your minds may be so enlightened that you may realise the hope given by God’s call, the wealth of the glory of his heritage among Christ’s people,
049	EPH	001	019	and the transcendent greatness of the power which he is able to exercise in dealing with us who believe in him.
049	EPH	001	020	The same mighty power was exerted on the Christ, when he raised the Christ from the dead and “caused him to sit at his right hand” on high, exalting him above all angels and archangels of every rank,
049	EPH	001	021	and above every name that can be named, whether in the present age, or in the age to come.
049	EPH	001	022	And God placed all things under Christ’s feet, and gave him to the church as its supreme head;
049	EPH	001	023	for the church is Christ’s body, and is filled by him who fills all things everywhere with his presence.
049	EPH	002	001	You yourselves were once dead because of your offences and sins.
049	EPH	002	002	For at one time you lived in sin, following the ways of the world, in subjection to the Ruler of the powers of the air – the Spirit who is still at work among the disobedient.
049	EPH	002	003	And it was among them that we all once lived our lives, indulging the cravings of our earthly nature, and carrying out the desires prompted by that earthly nature and by our own thoughts. Our nature exposed us to the divine wrath, like the rest of humanity.
049	EPH	002	004	Yet God, in his abundant compassion, and because of the great love with which he loved us,
049	EPH	002	005	even though we were dead because of our offences, gave life to us in giving life to the Christ. (By God’s loving kindness you have been saved.)
049	EPH	002	006	And, through our union with Christ Jesus, God raised us with him, and caused us to sit with him on high,
049	EPH	002	007	in order that, by his goodness to us in Christ Jesus, he might display in the ages to come the boundless wealth of his loving kindness.
049	EPH	002	008	For it is by God’s loving kindness that you have been saved, through your faith. It is not due to yourselves; the gift is God’s.
049	EPH	002	009	It is not due to obedience to Law, so that no one can boast.
049	EPH	002	010	For we are God’s handiwork, created, by our union with Christ Jesus, for the good actions in doing which God had pre-arranged that we should spend our lives.
049	EPH	002	011	Remember, therefore, that you were once Gentiles yourselves, as your bodies showed; you were called “the Uncircumcised” by those who were called “the Circumcised” – circumcised only by human hands!
049	EPH	002	012	Remember that you were at that time far from Christ; you were shut out from the citizenship of Israel; you were strangers to the covenants founded on God’s promise; you were in the world without hope and without God.
049	EPH	002	013	But now, through your union with Christ Jesus, you who once were far off have, by the shedding of the blood of the Christ, been brought near.
049	EPH	002	014	He it is who is our peace. He made the two divisions of humanity one, broke down the barrier that separated them,
049	EPH	002	015	and in his human nature put an end to the cause of enmity between them – the Law with its injunctions and ordinances – in order to create, through union with himself, from Jew and Gentile, one new humanity and so make peace.
049	EPH	002	016	And when, on the cross, he had destroyed their mutual enmity, he sought by means of his cross to reconcile them both to God, united in one body.
049	EPH	002	017	He came with the good news of peace for you who were far off, and of peace for those who were near;
049	EPH	002	018	for it is through him that we, the Jews and the Gentiles, united in the one Spirit, are now able to approach the Father.
049	EPH	002	019	It follows, then, that you are no longer strangers and foreigners, but are fellow citizens with Christ’s people and members of God’s household.
049	EPH	002	020	You have been built up on the foundation laid by the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone.
049	EPH	002	021	United in him, every part of the building, closely joined together, will grow into a temple, consecrated by its union with the Lord.
049	EPH	002	022	And, through union in him, you also are being built up together, to be a place where God lives through the Spirit.
049	EPH	003	001	For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Jesus, the Christ, for the sake of you Gentiles –
049	EPH	003	002	For you have heard, I suppose, of the responsible charge with which God entrusted me for your benefit,
049	EPH	003	003	and also that it was by direct revelation that the hidden purpose of God was made known to me, as I have already briefly told you.
049	EPH	003	004	And, by reading what I have written, you will be able to judge how far I understand this hidden purpose of God in Christ.
049	EPH	003	005	In former generations it was not made known to humanity, as fully as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to the apostles and prophets among Christ’s people –
049	EPH	003	006	That, by union with Christ Jesus and through the good news, the Gentiles are coheirs with us and members of one body, and that they share with us in God’s Promise.
049	EPH	003	007	Of this good news I become an assistant, in virtue of the charge with which God entrusted me in the exercise of his power –
049	EPH	003	008	Yes, to me, who am less than the least of all Christ’s people, was this charge entrusted! – to tell the Gentiles the good news of the boundless wealth to be found in the Christ,
049	EPH	003	009	and to make clear what is God’s way of working out that hidden purpose which from the first has been concealed in the mind of the Creator of all things;
049	EPH	003	010	so that now to the archangels and to all the powers on high should be made known, through the church, the all-embracing wisdom of God,
049	EPH	003	011	in accordance with that purpose which runs through all the ages and which he has now accomplished in Jesus, the Christ, our Master.
049	EPH	003	012	And in union with him, and through our trust in him, we find courage to approach God with confidence.
049	EPH	003	013	Therefore I beg you not to be disheartened at the sufferings that I am undergoing for your sakes; for they redound to your honour.
049	EPH	003	014	For this reason, then, I kneel before the Father –
049	EPH	003	015	from whom all “fatherhood” in heaven and on earth derives its name –
049	EPH	003	016	and pray that, in proportion to the wealth of his glory, he will strengthen you with his power by breathing his Spirit into your inmost soul,
049	EPH	003	017	so that the Christ, through your faith, may make his home within your hearts in love; and I pray that you, now firmly rooted and established, may, with all Christ’s people,
049	EPH	003	018	have the power to comprehend in all its width and length and height and depth,
049	EPH	003	019	and to understand – though it surpasses all understanding – the love of the Christ; and so be filled with all the fullness of God.
049	EPH	003	020	To him who, through his power which is at work within us, is able to do far more than anything that we can ask or conceive –
049	EPH	003	021	to him be all glory through the church and through Christ Jesus, for all generations, age after age. Amen.
049	EPH	004	001	I beg you, then – I who am a prisoner in the Master’s cause – to live lives worthy of the call that you have received;
049	EPH	004	002	always humble and gentle, patient, bearing lovingly with one another,
049	EPH	004	003	and striving to maintain in the bond of peace the unity given by the Spirit.
049	EPH	004	004	There is but one body and one Spirit, just as there was but one hope set before you when you received your call.
049	EPH	004	005	There is but one Lord, one faith, one baptism.
049	EPH	004	006	There is but one God and Father of all – the God who is over all, pervades all, and is in all.
049	EPH	004	007	Everyone of us, however, has been entrusted with some charge, each in accordance with the extent of the gift of the Christ.
049	EPH	004	008	That is why it is said – “When he went up on high, he led his captives into captivity. And gave gifts to humanity.”
049	EPH	004	009	Now surely this “going up” must imply that he had already gone down into the world beneath.
049	EPH	004	010	He who went down is the same as he who went up – up beyond the highest heaven, so that he might fill all things with his presence.
049	EPH	004	011	And he it is who gave to the church apostles, prophets, missionaries, pastors, and teachers,
049	EPH	004	012	to fit his people for the work of the ministry, for the building up of the body of the Christ.
049	EPH	004	013	And this will continue, until we all attain to that unity which is given by faith and by a fuller knowledge of the Son of God; until we reach maturity – the full standard of the perfection of the Christ.
049	EPH	004	014	Then we will no longer be like infants, tossed backward and forward, blown about by every breath of human teaching and by people’s trickery and craftiness;
049	EPH	004	015	but holding the truth in a spirit of love, we will grow into complete union with him who is our head – Christ himself.
049	EPH	004	016	For from him the whole body, closely joined and knit together by the contact of every part with the source of its life, derives its power to grow, in proportion to the vigour of each individual part; and so is being built up in a spirit of love.
049	EPH	004	017	This, then, as one in union with the Lord, I implore: Do not continue to live such purposeless lives as the Gentiles live,
049	EPH	004	018	with their powers of discernment darkened, cut off from the life of God, owing to the ignorance that prevails among them and to the hardness of their hearts.
049	EPH	004	019	Lost to all sense of shame, they have abandoned themselves to licentiousness, in order to practice every kind of impurity without restraint.
049	EPH	004	020	But far different is the lesson you learned from the Christ – if, that is, you really listened to him,
049	EPH	004	021	and through union with him were taught the truth, as it is to be found in Jesus.
049	EPH	004	022	For you learned with regard to your former way of living that you must cast off your old nature, which, yielding to deluding passions, grows corrupt;
049	EPH	004	023	that the spirit of your minds must be constantly renewed;
049	EPH	004	024	and that you must clothe yourselves in that new nature which was created to resemble God, with the righteousness and holiness springing from the truth.
049	EPH	004	025	Since, therefore, you have cast off what is false, you must every one of you speak the truth to your neighbours. For we are united to one another like the parts of a body.
049	EPH	004	026	Be angry, yet do not sin. Do not let the sun go down on your anger;
049	EPH	004	027	and give no opportunity to the devil.
049	EPH	004	028	Let the person who steals steal no longer, but rather they should toil with their hands at honest work, so that they may have something to share with anyone in need.
049	EPH	004	029	Never let any foul word pass your lips, but only such good words as the occasion demands, so that they may be a help to those who hear them.
049	EPH	004	030	And do not grieve God’s Holy Spirit; for it was through that Spirit that God sealed you as his, against the day of redemption.
049	EPH	004	031	Let all bitterness, passion, anger, brawling, and abusive language be banished from among you, as well as all malice.
049	EPH	004	032	Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, ready to forgive one another, just as God, in Christ, forgave you.
049	EPH	005	001	Therefore imitate God, as his dear children,
049	EPH	005	002	and live a life of love, following the example of the Christ, who loved you and gave himself for you as an offering and a sacrifice to God, that should be fragrant and acceptable.
049	EPH	005	003	As for sexual immorality and every kind of impurity, or greed, do not let them even be mentioned among you, as befits Christ’s people,
049	EPH	005	004	nor shameful conduct, nor foolish talk or jesting, for they are wholly out of place among you; but rather thanksgiving.
049	EPH	005	005	For of this you may be sure – that no one who is unchaste or impure or greedy of gain (for to be greedy of gain is idolatry) has any place awaiting him in the kingdom of the Christ and God.
049	EPH	005	006	Do not let anyone deceive you with specious arguments. Those are the sins that bring down the wrath of God on the disobedient.
049	EPH	005	007	Therefore have nothing to do with such people.
049	EPH	005	008	For, although you were once in darkness, now, by your union with the Lord, you are in the light. Live as children of light –
049	EPH	005	009	for the outcome of life in the light may be seen in every form of goodness, righteousness, and sincerity –
049	EPH	005	010	always trying to find out what is pleasing to the Lord.
049	EPH	005	011	Take no part in deeds of darkness, from which no good can come; on the contrary, expose them.
049	EPH	005	012	It is degrading even to speak of the things continually done by them in secret.
049	EPH	005	013	All such actions, when exposed, have their true character made manifest by the light.
049	EPH	005	014	For everything that has its true character made manifest is clear as light. And that is why it is said – “Sleeper, awake! Arise from the dead, and the Christ will give you light!”
049	EPH	005	015	Take great care, then, how you live – not unwisely but wisely,
049	EPH	005	016	making the most of every opportunity; for these are evil days.
049	EPH	005	017	Therefore do not grow thoughtless, but try to understand what the Lord’s will is.
049	EPH	005	018	Do not drink wine to excess, for that leads to profligacy; but seek to be filled with the Spirit of God, and speak to one another in psalms and hymns and sacred songs.
049	EPH	005	019	Sing and make music in your hearts to the Lord.
049	EPH	005	020	Always give thanks for everything to our God and Father, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
049	EPH	005	021	Submit to one another because you honour and respect Christ.
049	EPH	005	022	Wives should submit to their husbands as submitting to the Lord.
049	EPH	005	023	For a man is the head of his wife, as the Christ is the head of the church – being indeed himself the Saviour of his body.
049	EPH	005	024	But as the church submits to the Christ, so also should wives submit to their husbands in everything.
049	EPH	005	025	Husbands, love your wives, just as the Christ loved the church, and gave himself for her,
049	EPH	005	026	to make her holy, after purifying her by the washing with the water, according to his promise;
049	EPH	005	027	so that he might himself bring the church, in all her beauty, into his own presence, with no spot or wrinkle or blemish of any kind, but that she might be holy and faultless.
049	EPH	005	028	That is how husbands ought to love their wives – as if they were their own bodies. A man who loves his wife is really loving himself;
049	EPH	005	029	for no one ever yet hated his own body. But everyone feeds his body and cares for it, just as the Christ for the church;
049	EPH	005	030	for we are members of his body.
049	EPH	005	031	For this cause a man will leave his father and mother, and be united to his wife; and the man and his wife will become one.
049	EPH	005	032	In this there is a profound truth – I am speaking of Christ and his church.
049	EPH	005	033	However, for you individually, let each love his wife as if she were himself; and the wife be careful to respect her husband.
049	EPH	006	001	Children, obey your parents, as children of the Lord; for that is but right.
049	EPH	006	002	“Honour your father and mother” – this is the first Commandment with a promise –
049	EPH	006	003	“so that you may prosper and have a long life on earth.”
049	EPH	006	004	And fathers, do not irritate your children, but bring them up with Christian discipline and instruction.
049	EPH	006	005	Slaves, obey your earthly masters, with anxious care, giving them ungrudging service, as if obeying the Christ;
049	EPH	006	006	not only when their eyes are on you, as if you had merely to please people, but as slaves of Christ, who are trying to carry out the will of God.
049	EPH	006	007	Give your service heartily and cheerfully, as working for the Master and not for people;
049	EPH	006	008	for you know that everyone will be rewarded by the Master for any honest work that he has done, whether he is a slave or free.
049	EPH	006	009	And masters, treat your slaves in the same spirit. Give up threatening them; for you know that he who is both their Master and yours is in heaven, and that before him there is no distinction of rank.
049	EPH	006	010	For the future, find strength in your union with the Lord, and in the power which comes from his might.
049	EPH	006	011	Put on the full armour of God, so that you may be able to stand your ground against the stratagems of the devil.
049	EPH	006	012	For ours is no struggle against enemies of flesh and blood, but against all the various powers of evil that hold sway in the darkness around us, against the spirits of wickedness on high.
049	EPH	006	013	Therefore take up the full armour of God, so that when the evil day comes, you may be able to withstand the attack, and, having fought to the end, still to stand your ground.
049	EPH	006	014	Stand your ground, then, with truth for your belt, and with righteousness for your breastplate,
049	EPH	006	015	and with the readiness to serve the good news of peace as shoes for your feet.
049	EPH	006	016	At every onslaught take up faith for your shield; for with it you will be able to extinguish all the flaming darts of the evil one.
049	EPH	006	017	And receive the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit – which is the message of God – always with prayer and supplication.
049	EPH	006	018	Pray in spirit at all times. Be intent on this, with unwearying perseverance and supplication for all Christ’s people –
049	EPH	006	019	and on my behalf also, so that when I begin to speak, words may be given me, so that I may fearlessly make known the inmost truth of the good news,
049	EPH	006	020	on behalf of which I am an ambassador – in chains! Pray that, in telling it, I may speak fearlessly as I ought.
049	EPH	006	021	To enable you, as well as others, to know all that concerns me and what I am doing, Tychicus, our dear friend and faithful helper in the Master’s cause, will tell you everything.
049	EPH	006	022	I am sending him to you on purpose that you may learn all about us, and that he may cheer your hearts.
049	EPH	006	023	May God, the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ give every follower peace, and love linked with faith.
049	EPH	006	024	May God’s blessing be with all who love our Lord Jesus Christ with an undying love.

# BOOK	050	PHI	Philippians	Philippians
050	PHI	001	001	To all Christ’s people at Philippi, with the supervisors and assistants, from Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus.
050	PHI	001	002	May God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you, and give you peace.
050	PHI	001	003	Every recollection that I have of you is a cause of thanksgiving to God,
050	PHI	001	004	always, in every prayer that I offer for you all – my prayers are full of joy –
050	PHI	001	005	because of the share that you have had in spreading the good news, from the first day that you received it until now.
050	PHI	001	006	For of this I am confident, that he who began a good work in you will complete it in readiness for the day of Jesus Christ.
050	PHI	001	007	And, indeed, I am justified in feeling like this about you all; because you have a warm place in my heart – you who all, both in my imprisonment and in the work of defending and establishing the good news, shared my privilege with me.
050	PHI	001	008	God will bear me witness how I yearn for you all with the tenderness of Christ Jesus.
050	PHI	001	009	And what I pray for is this – that your love may grow yet stronger and stronger, with increasing knowledge and all discernment,
050	PHI	001	010	until you are able to appreciate all moral distinctions. And I pray, too, that you may be kept pure and blameless against the day of Christ,
050	PHI	001	011	bearing a rich harvest of that righteousness which comes through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.
050	PHI	001	012	Friends, I want you to realise that what has happened to me has actually served to forward the good news.
050	PHI	001	013	It has even become evident, not only to all the imperial guard, but to everyone else, that it is for Christ’s sake that I am in chains.
050	PHI	001	014	And besides this, most of our fellow followers have gained confidence in the Lord through my chains, and now venture with far greater freedom to speak of God’s message fearlessly.
050	PHI	001	015	It is true that some do proclaim the Christ out of jealousy and opposition, but there are others who proclaim him from goodwill.
050	PHI	001	016	The latter do it from love for me, knowing that I have been appointed to plead the cause of the good news.
050	PHI	001	017	The former spread the news of the Christ in a factious spirit, and not sincerely, thinking to add to the pain of my chains.
050	PHI	001	018	But what of that? Only that in some way or other, either with assumed or with real earnestness, Christ is being made known; and at that I rejoice.
050	PHI	001	019	Yes, and I will rejoice, for I know that, through your prayers and through a rich supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, all this will make for my salvation.
050	PHI	001	020	And this will fulfil my earnest expectation and hope that I will have no cause for shame, but that, with unfailing courage, now as before, Christ will be honoured in my body, whether by my life or by my death,
050	PHI	001	021	for to me life is Christ, and death is gain.
050	PHI	001	022	But what if the life here in the body – if this brings me fruit from my labours? Then which to choose I cannot tell! I am sorely perplexed either way!
050	PHI	001	023	My own desire is to depart and be with Christ, for this would be far better.
050	PHI	001	024	But, for your sakes, it may be more needful that I should still remain here in the body.
050	PHI	001	025	Yes, I am confident that this is so, and therefore I am sure that I will stay, and stay near you all, to promote your progress and joy in the faith;
050	PHI	001	026	so that, when you once more have me among you, you, in your union with Christ Jesus, may find in me fresh cause for exultation.
050	PHI	001	027	Under all circumstances let your lives be worthy of the good news of the Christ: so that, whether I come and see you, or whether I hear of your affairs at a distance, I may know that you are standing firm, animated by one spirit, and joining with one heart in a common struggle for the faith taught by the good news,
050	PHI	001	028	without ever shrinking from your opponents. To them this will be a sign of their destruction and of your salvation – a sign from God.
050	PHI	001	029	For, on behalf of Christ, you have had the privilege granted you, not only of trusting in him, but also of suffering on his behalf.
050	PHI	001	030	You will be engaged in the same hard struggle as that which you once saw me waging, and which you hear that I am waging still.
050	PHI	002	001	If, then, any encouragement comes through union with Christ, if there is any persuasive power in love, if there is any communion with the Spirit, if there is any tenderness or pity,
050	PHI	002	002	I entreat you to make my happiness complete – live together animated by the same spirit and in mutual love, one in heart, animated by one Spirit.
050	PHI	002	003	Nothing should be done out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility lift others up above yourselves,
050	PHI	002	004	considering not only your own interests but also the interests of others.
050	PHI	002	005	Let the spirit of Christ Jesus be yours also.
050	PHI	002	006	Though the divine nature was his from the beginning, yet he did not look on equality with God as above all things to be clung to,
050	PHI	002	007	but impoverished himself by taking the nature of a servant and becoming like one of us;
050	PHI	002	008	he appeared among us as a man, and still further humbled himself by submitting even to death – to death on a cross!
050	PHI	002	009	And that is why God raised him to the very highest place, and gave him the name which stands above all other names,
050	PHI	002	010	so that in adoration of the name of Jesus every knee should bend, in heaven, on earth, and under the earth,
050	PHI	002	011	and that every tongue should acknowledge JESUS CHRIST as LORD – to the glory of God the Father.
050	PHI	002	012	Therefore, my dear friends, as you have always been obedient in the past, so now work out your own salvation with anxious care, not only when I am with you, but all the more now that I am absent.
050	PHI	002	013	Remember it is God who, in his kindness, is at work within you, enabling you both to will and to work.
050	PHI	002	014	In all that you do, avoid murmuring and dissension,
050	PHI	002	015	so as to prove yourselves blameless and innocent – faultless children of God, in the midst of an evil-disposed and perverse generation, in which you are seen shining like stars in a dark world,
050	PHI	002	016	offering to them the message of life; and then I will be able at the day of Christ to boast that I did not run my course for nothing, or toil for nothing.
050	PHI	002	017	And yet, even if, when your faith is offered as a sacrifice to God, my lifeblood must be poured out in addition, still I will rejoice and share the joy of you all;
050	PHI	002	018	and you must also rejoice and share my joy.
050	PHI	002	019	I hope, however, as one who trusts in the Lord Jesus, to send Timothy to you before long, so that I may myself be cheered by receiving news of you.
050	PHI	002	020	For I have no one but him to send – no one of kindred spirit who would take the same genuine interest in your welfare.
050	PHI	002	021	They are all pursuing their own aims and not those of Christ Jesus.
050	PHI	002	022	But you know what Timothy has proved himself to be, and how, like a child working for his father, he worked hard with me in spreading the good news.
050	PHI	002	023	It is Timothy, then, whom I hope to send, just as soon as I find out what is going to happen to me here.
050	PHI	002	024	And I am confident, as one who trusts in the Lord Jesus, that before long I myself will follow.
050	PHI	002	025	Still I think it necessary to send Epaphroditus to you now, for he is my dear friend, fellow worker, and fellow soldier, and he was also your messenger to help me in my need.
050	PHI	002	026	For he has been longing to see you all, and has been distressed because you heard of his illness.
050	PHI	002	027	And I can assure you that his illness very nearly proved fatal. But God had pity on him, and not on him only but also on me, so that I might not have sorrow on sorrow.
050	PHI	002	028	I am all the more ready, therefore, to send him, so that the sight of him may revive your spirits and my own sorrow be lightened.
050	PHI	002	029	Give him, then, the heartiest of Christian welcomes, and hold such people in great honour.
050	PHI	002	030	For it was owing to his devotion to the Master’s work that he was at the point of death, having risked his own life in the effort to supply what was wanting in the help that you sent me.
050	PHI	003	001	In conclusion, my friends, may all joy be yours in your union with the Lord. To repeat what I have already written does not weary me, and is the safe course for you.
050	PHI	003	002	Beware of those dogs! Beware of those mischievous workers! Beware of the men who mutilate themselves!
050	PHI	003	003	For it is we who are the circumcised – we whose worship is prompted by the Spirit of God, who exult in Christ Jesus, and who do not rely on external privileges;
050	PHI	003	004	though I, if anyone, have cause to rely even on them. If anyone thinks he can rely on external privileges, far more can I!
050	PHI	003	005	I was circumcised when eight days old; I am an Israelite by birth, and of the tribe of Benjamin; I am a Hebrew, and the child of Hebrews. As to the Law, I was a Pharisee;
050	PHI	003	006	as to zeal, I was a persecutor of the church; as to such righteousness as is due to Law, I proved myself blameless.
050	PHI	003	007	But all the things which I once held to be gains I have now, for the Christ’s sake, come to count as loss.
050	PHI	003	008	More than that, I count everything as loss, for the sake of the exceeding value of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord. And for his sake I have lost everything, and count it as rubbish, if I may but gain Christ and be found in union with him;
050	PHI	003	009	any righteousness that I have being, not the righteousness that results from Law, but the righteousness which comes through faith in Christ – the righteousness which is derived from God and is founded on faith.
050	PHI	003	010	Then indeed I will know Christ, and the power of his resurrection, and all that it means to share his sufferings,
050	PHI	003	011	in the hope that, if I become like him in death, I may possibly attain to the resurrection from the dead.
050	PHI	003	012	Not that I have already laid hold of it, or that I am already made perfect. But I press on, in the hope of actually laying hold of that for which indeed I was laid hold of by Christ Jesus.
050	PHI	003	013	For I, friends, do not regard myself as having yet laid hold of it. But this one thing I do – forgetting what lies behind, and straining every nerve for that which lies in front,
050	PHI	003	014	I press on to the goal, to gain the prize of that heavenward call which God gave me through Christ Jesus.
050	PHI	003	015	Let all of us, then, whose faith is mature, think this way. Then, if on any matter you think otherwise, God will make that also plain to you.
050	PHI	003	016	Only we are bound to order our lives by what we have already attained.
050	PHI	003	017	My friends, unite in following my example, and fix your eyes on those who are living by the pattern which we have set you.
050	PHI	003	018	For there are many – of whom I have often told you, and now tell you even with tears – who are living in enmity to the cross of the Christ.
050	PHI	003	019	The end of such people is ruin; for their appetites are their God, and they glory in their shame; their minds are given up to earthly things.
050	PHI	003	020	But we are citizens of heaven, and from heaven we expect a saviour to come, the Lord Jesus Christ.
050	PHI	003	021	By the exercise of his power to bring everything into subjection to himself, he will make our humble bodies like his glorious body.
050	PHI	004	001	So then, my dear friends, whom I am longing to see – you who are my joy and my crown, stand fast in union with the Lord, dear friends.
050	PHI	004	002	I entreat Euodia, and I entreat Syntyche, to live in harmony, in union with the Lord;
050	PHI	004	003	yes, and I ask you, my true comrade, to help them, remembering that they toiled by my side in spreading the good news; and so, too, did Clement and my other fellow workers, whose names are in the book of life.
050	PHI	004	004	All joy be yours at all times in your union with the Lord. Again I repeat – All joy be yours.
050	PHI	004	005	Let your forbearing spirit be plain to everyone. The Lord is near.
050	PHI	004	006	Do not be anxious about anything; but under all circumstances, by prayer and entreaty joined with thanksgiving, make your needs known to God.
050	PHI	004	007	Then the peace of God, which is beyond all human understanding, will stand guard over your hearts and thoughts, through your union with Christ Jesus.
050	PHI	004	008	In conclusion, friends, whenever you find things that are true or honourable, righteous or pure, loveable or praiseworthy, or if virtue and honour have any meaning, let them fill your thoughts.
050	PHI	004	009	All that you learned and received and heard and saw in me put into practice continually; and then God, the giver of peace, will be with you.
050	PHI	004	010	It was a matter of great joy to me, as one in union with the Lord, that at length your interest in me had revived. The interest indeed you had, but not the opportunity.
050	PHI	004	011	Do not think that I am saying this under the pressure of want. For I, however I am placed, have learned to be independent of circumstances.
050	PHI	004	012	I know how to face humble circumstances, and I know how to face prosperity. Into all and every human experience I have been initiated – into plenty and hunger, into prosperity and want.
050	PHI	004	013	I can do everything through the strength of the one who makes me strong!
050	PHI	004	014	Yet you have acted nobly in sharing my troubles.
050	PHI	004	015	And you at Philippi know, as well as I, that in the early days of the good news – at the time when I had just left Macedonia – no church, with the one exception of yourselves, had anything to do with me as far as giving and receiving are concerned.
050	PHI	004	016	Indeed, even while I was still in Thessalonica, you sent more than once to relieve my wants.
050	PHI	004	017	It is not that I am anxious for your gifts, but I am anxious to see the abundant return that will be placed to your account. I have enough of everything, and to spare.
050	PHI	004	018	My wants are fully satisfied, now that I have received from Epaphroditus the gifts which you sent me – the sweet fragrance of a sacrifice acceptable and pleasing to God.
050	PHI	004	019	And my God, out of the greatness of his wealth, will, in glory, fully satisfy your every need, through your union with Christ Jesus.
050	PHI	004	020	To him, our God and Father, be ascribed all glory for every and ever. Amen.
050	PHI	004	021	Give my greeting to everyone of the people of Christ Jesus. The Lord’s followers who are with me send your their greetings.
050	PHI	004	022	All Christ’s people here, and especially those who belong to the Emperor’s household, send theirs.
050	PHI	004	023	May the blessing of the Lord Jesus Christ rest on your souls.

# BOOK	051	COL	Colossians	Colossians
051	COL	001	001	From Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus, by the will of God, and from Timothy, also a follower of the Lord.
051	COL	001	002	To Christ’s people at Colossae – the followers who are faithful to him: May God, our Father, bless you and give you peace.
051	COL	001	003	Whenever we pray we never fail to thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, for you,
051	COL	001	004	now that we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love that you have for all his people,
051	COL	001	005	because of the hope which is kept safe for you in heaven. Of this hope you heard long ago in the true message of the good news which reached you,
051	COL	001	006	bearing fruit and growing, as it does, through all the world, just as it did among you from the very day that you heard of God’s loving kindness, and understood what that loving kindness really is.
051	COL	001	007	It is just what you learned from Epaphras, our dear fellow servant, who, as a minister of the Christ, faithfully represents us,
051	COL	001	008	and who told us of the love with which the Spirit has inspired you.
051	COL	001	009	And therefore we, from the very day that we heard this, have never ceased praying for you, or asking that you may be filled with the knowledge of the will of God, which comes through all true spiritual wisdom and insight.
051	COL	001	010	Then you will live lives worthy of the Master, and so please God in every way. Your lives will be fruitful in every kind of good action, and grow into a fuller knowledge of God;
051	COL	001	011	you will be made strong at all points with a strength worthy of the power manifested in his glory – strong to endure with patience, and even with gladness, whatever may happen to you;
051	COL	001	012	and you will give thanks to the Father who made you fit to share the lot which awaits Christ’s people in the realms of light.
051	COL	001	013	For God has rescued us from the tyranny of darkness, and has removed us into the kingdom of his Son, who is the embodiment of his love,
051	COL	001	014	and through whom we have found deliverance in the forgiveness of our sins.
051	COL	001	015	For Christ is the incarnation of the invisible God – firstborn and head of all creation;
051	COL	001	016	for in him was created all that is in heaven and on earth, the visible and the invisible – angels and archangels and all the powers of heaven.
051	COL	001	017	All has been created through him and for him. He was before all things, and all things unite in him;
051	COL	001	018	and he is the head of the church, which is his body. The firstborn from the dead, he is to the church the source of its life, that he, in all things, may stand first.
051	COL	001	019	For it pleased the Father that in him the divine nature in all its fulness should live,
051	COL	001	020	and through him to reconcile all things to himself (making peace by the shedding of Christ’s blood offered on the cross) – whether on earth or in heaven.
051	COL	001	021	And it pleased God that you, once estranged from him and hostile towards him in your thoughts, intent only on wickedness –
051	COL	001	022	but now he has reconciled you to himself by the sacrifice of Christ’s earthly body in death – it has pleased God that you should stand in his presence holy, pure, and blameless,
051	COL	001	023	if only you remain true to your faith, firm and immovable, never abandoning the hope held out in the good news to which you listened, which has been proclaimed among all created things under heaven, and of which I, Paul, was made an assistant.
051	COL	001	024	Now at last I can rejoice in my sufferings on your behalf, and in my own person I supplement the afflictions endured by the Christ, for the sake of his body, the church;
051	COL	001	025	of which I myself became a minister in virtue of the office with which God entrusted me for your benefit, to declare the message of God in all its fulness –
051	COL	001	026	that truth which has been hidden from former ages and generations. But now it has been revealed to God’s people,
051	COL	001	027	to whom it was his pleasure to make known the surpassing glory of that hidden truth when proclaimed among the Gentiles – “Christ among you! Your hope of glory!”
051	COL	001	028	This is the Christ whom we proclaim, warning everyone, and instructing everyone, with all the wisdom that we possess, in the hope of bringing everyone into God’s presence perfected by union with Christ.
051	COL	001	029	It is for that I toil, struggling with all the energy which he inspires and which works powerfully within me.
051	COL	002	001	I want you to know in how great a struggle I am engaged for you and for Christ’s people at Laodicea, and for all who have not yet seen me;
051	COL	002	002	in the hope that they, being bound to one another by love, and keeping in view the full blessedness of a firm conviction, may be encouraged to strive for a perfect knowledge of God’s hidden truth,
051	COL	002	003	even Christ himself, in whom all treasures of wisdom and knowledge lie hidden.
051	COL	002	004	I say this to prevent anyone from deceiving you by plausible arguments.
051	COL	002	005	It is true that I am not with you in person, but I am with you in spirit, and am glad to see the good order and the unbroken front resulting from your faith in Christ.
051	COL	002	006	Since, therefore, you have received Jesus, the Christ, as your Lord, live your lives in union with him –
051	COL	002	007	rooted in him, building up your characters through union with him, growing stronger through your faith, as you were taught, overflowing with faith and thanksgiving.
051	COL	002	008	Take care that there is not someone who will carry you away by his “philosophy” – a hollow sham! – following, as it does, mere human traditions, and dealing with puerile questions of this world, and not with Christ.
051	COL	002	009	For in Christ the Godhead in all its fulness dwells incarnate;
051	COL	002	010	and, by your union with him, you also are filled with it. He is the head of all archangels and powers of heaven.
051	COL	002	011	By your union with him you received a circumcision that was not performed by human hands, when you threw off the tyranny of the earthly body, and received the circumcision of the Christ.
051	COL	002	012	For in baptism you were buried with Christ; and in baptism you were also raised to life with him, through your faith in the omnipotence of God, who raised him from the dead.
051	COL	002	013	And to you, who once were dead, by reason of your sins and your uncircumcised nature – to you God gave life in giving life to Christ! He pardoned all our sins!
051	COL	002	014	He canceled the bond which stood against us – the bond that consisted of ordinances – and which was directly hostile to us! He has taken it out of our way by nailing it to the cross!
051	COL	002	015	He rid himself of all the powers of evil, and held them up to open contempt, when he celebrated his triumph over them on the cross!
051	COL	002	016	Do not, then, allow anyone to take you to task on questions of eating or drinking, or in the matter of annual or monthly or weekly festivals.
051	COL	002	017	These things are only the shadow of what is to come; the substance is in the Christ.
051	COL	002	018	Do not let anyone defraud you of the reality by affecting delight in so-called “humility” and angel-worship. Such a person busies themselves with their visions, and without reason are rendered conceited by their merely human intellect.
051	COL	002	019	They fail to maintain union with the head, to whom it is due that the whole body, nourished and knit together by the contact and connexion of every part, grows with a divine growth.
051	COL	002	020	Since, with Christ, you became dead to the puerile teaching of this world, why do you submit, as if you still belonged to the world,
051	COL	002	021	to such ordinances as “Do not handle, or taste, or touch”?
051	COL	002	022	For all the things referred to in them cease to exist when used. You are following mere human directions and instructions.
051	COL	002	023	Such prohibitions appear reasonable where there is a desire for self-imposed service, and so-called “humility,” and harsh treatment of the body, but are of no real value against the indulgence of our earthly nature.
051	COL	003	001	Since, therefore, you were raised to life with the Christ, seek for the things that are above; for it is there that the Christ is seated at the right hand of God.
051	COL	003	002	Fix your thoughts on the things that are above, not on those that are on earth.
051	COL	003	003	For you died, and your life now lies hidden, with the Christ, in God.
051	COL	003	004	When the Christ, who is our life, appears, then you also will appear with him in glory.
051	COL	003	005	Therefore destroy all that is earthly in you – immorality, uncleanness, passions, evil desires, and that greed which is idolatry.
051	COL	003	006	These are the things because of which the wrath of God comes,
051	COL	003	007	and to which you, like others, once devoted your lives, when you lived for them.
051	COL	003	008	You, however, must now lay aside all such things – anger, passion, malice, slander, abuse.
051	COL	003	009	Never lie to one another. Get rid of your old self and its habits,
051	COL	003	010	and clothe yourselves with that new self, which, as it gains in knowledge, is being constantly renewed in resemblance to him who made it.
051	COL	003	011	In that new life there is no distinction between Greek and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free; but Christ is all! – and in all!
051	COL	003	012	Therefore, as God’s people, consecrated and dear to him, clothe yourselves with tenderness of heart, kindliness, humility, gentleness, forbearance;
051	COL	003	013	bearing with one another, and, when there is any ground for complaint, forgiving one another freely. As the Master freely forgave you, so you must forgive one another.
051	COL	003	014	Over all these virtues put on love; for that is the belt which makes all complete.
051	COL	003	015	Let the peace that the Christ gives decide all doubts within your hearts; for you also were called to the enjoyment of peace as members of one body. And show yourselves thankful.
051	COL	003	016	Let the message of the Christ be alive in your minds in all its wealth, bringing all wisdom with it. Teach and admonish one another with psalms, and hymns, and sacred songs, full of the loving kindness of God, lifting your hearts in song to him.
051	COL	003	017	And, whatever you say or do, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus; and through him offer thanksgiving to God the father.
051	COL	003	018	Wives, submit to your husbands, as befits those who belong to the Lord.
051	COL	003	019	Husbands, love your wives, and never treat them harshly.
051	COL	003	020	Children, always obey your parents; for that is pleasant to see in those who belong to the Lord.
051	COL	003	021	Fathers, never irritate your children, otherwise they might become disheartened.
051	COL	003	022	Slaves, always obey your earthly masters, not only when their eyes are on you, as if you had but to please people alone, but giving them ungrudging service, in your respect for the Master.
051	COL	003	023	Whatever you do, do it with all your heart, as if working for the Master and not for people,
051	COL	003	024	since you know that it is from the Master that you will receive the inheritance which will be your reward. You are serving Christ, the Master.
051	COL	003	025	Those who do wrong will reap the wrong they have done; and there will be no partiality.
051	COL	004	001	Masters, do what is right and fair by your slaves, for you know that you also have a Master – in heaven.
051	COL	004	002	Devote yourselves to prayer. Give your whole mind to it, and also offer thanksgiving;
051	COL	004	003	and at the same time pray for us, so that God may give us an opening for our message, so that we may speak of the truths hidden in the Christ – the truths for which I am in chains!
051	COL	004	004	Then I will make them known, as I ought to do.
051	COL	004	005	Show tact in your behaviour to the outside world, making the most of every opportunity.
051	COL	004	006	Let your conversation always be kindly, but not bland, season it, as it were, with salt; be aware in each case of the answer you should be giving.
051	COL	004	007	Our dear friend, Tychicus, will tell you all about me. He is a faithful minister, and a fellow servant in the Master’s cause.
051	COL	004	008	I send him to you expressly that you may learn our circumstances, and that he may give you encouragement.
051	COL	004	009	With him will be Onesimus, our dear faithful friend, who is one of yourselves. They will tell you all that is going on here.
051	COL	004	010	My fellow prisoner, Aristarchus, sends you his greeting, and Barnabas’s cousin, Mark, sends his. (You have received directions about him. If he comes to you, make him welcome.)
051	COL	004	011	Joshua, who is called Justus, also sends his greeting. These are the only converts from Judaism who have worked with me for the kingdom of God; I have found them a great comfort.
051	COL	004	012	Epaphras, who is one of yourselves, sends you his greeting. He is a servant of Christ Jesus, and is always most earnest in your behalf in his prayers, praying that you may stand firm, with a matured faith and with a sure conviction of all that is in accordance with God’s will.
051	COL	004	013	I can bear testimony to the deep interest he takes in you, as well as in the followers at Laodicea and at Hierapolis.
051	COL	004	014	Luke, our dear doctor, sends you his greeting, and Demas sends his.
051	COL	004	015	Give my greeting to the followers at Laodicea, and to Nymphe, and to the church that meets at her house.
051	COL	004	016	And when this letter has been read to you, see that it is also read before the church at Laodicea, and that you yourselves read the letter which will be forwarded from there.
051	COL	004	017	Give this message to Archippus – “Take care to discharge to the best of your ability the office to which you were appointed in the Master’s cause.”
051	COL	004	018	I, Paul, add this greeting in my own handwriting. Remember these chains of mine. God’s blessing be with you.

# BOOK	052	1TH	1 Thessalonians	1 Thessalonians
052	1TH	001	001	To the Thessalonian church in union with God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, from Paul, Silas, and Timothy. May God bless you and give you peace.
052	1TH	001	002	We always mention you in our prayers and thank God for you all;
052	1TH	001	003	recalling continually before our God and Father the efforts that have resulted from your faith, the toil prompted by your love, and the patient endurance sustained by your hope in our Lord Jesus Christ.
052	1TH	001	004	Friends, whom God loves, we know that he has chosen you,
052	1TH	001	005	because the good news that we brought came home to you, not merely as so many words, but with a power and a fulness of conviction due to the Holy Spirit. For you know the life that we lived among you for your good.
052	1TH	001	006	And you yourselves began to follow, not only our example, but the Master’s also; and, in spite of much suffering, you welcomed the message with a joy inspired by the Holy Spirit,
052	1TH	001	007	and so became a pattern to all who believed in Christ throughout Macedonia and Greece.
052	1TH	001	008	For it was from you that the Lord’s message resounded throughout Macedonia and Greece; and, more than that, your faith in God has become known far and wide; so that there is no need for us to say another word.
052	1TH	001	009	Indeed, in speaking about us, the people themselves tell of the reception you gave us, and how, turning to God from your idols, you became servants of the true and living God,
052	1TH	001	010	and are now awaiting the return from heaven of his Son whom he raised from the dead – Jesus, our deliverer from the coming wrath.
052	1TH	002	001	Yes, friends, you yourselves know that your reception of us was not without result.
052	1TH	002	002	For, although we had experienced suffering and ill treatment, as you know, at Philippi, we had the courage, by the help of our God, to tell you God’s good news in spite of great opposition.
052	1TH	002	003	Our appeal to you was not based on a delusion, nor was it made from unworthy motives, or with any intention of misleading you.
052	1TH	002	004	But, having been found worthy by God to be entrusted with the good news, therefore we tell it; with a view to please, not people, but God who proves our hearts.
052	1TH	002	005	Never at any time, as you know, did we use the language of flattery, or make false professions in order to hide selfish aims. God will bear witness to that.
052	1TH	002	006	Nor did we seek to win honour from people, whether from you or from others, although, as apostles of Christ, we might have burdened you with our support.
052	1TH	002	007	But we lived among you with the simplicity of a child; we were like a woman nursing her own children.
052	1TH	002	008	In our strong affection for you, that seemed to us the best way of sharing with you, not only God’s good news, but our lives as well – so dear had you become to us.
052	1TH	002	009	You will not have forgotten, friends, our labour and toil. Night and day we used to work at our trades, so as not be a burden to any of you, while we proclaimed to you God’s good news.
052	1TH	002	010	You will bear witness, and God also, that our relations with you who believed in Christ were pure, and upright, and beyond reproach.
052	1TH	002	011	Indeed, you know that, like a father with his own children, we used to encourage and comfort every one of you, and solemnly plead with you;
052	1TH	002	012	so that you should make your daily lives worthy of God who is calling you into the glory of his kingdom.
052	1TH	002	013	This, too, is a reason why we, on our part, are continually thanking God – because, in receiving the teaching that you had from us, you accepted it, not as the teaching of humans, but as what it really is – the teaching of God, which is even now doing its work within you who believe in Christ.
052	1TH	002	014	For you, friends, began to follow the example of the churches of God in Judea which are in union with Jesus Christ; you, in your turn, suffering at the hands of your fellow citizens, in the same way as those churches did at the hands of their people –
052	1TH	002	015	who killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and persecuted us also. They do not try to please God, and they are enemies to all humanity,
052	1TH	002	016	for they try to prevent us from speaking to the Gentiles with a view to their salvation, and so are always filling up the measure of their iniquity. But the wrath of God has come upon them to the full!
052	1TH	002	017	As for ourselves, friends, our having been bereaved of you even for a short time – though in body only, and not in spirit – made us all the more eager to see your faces again; and the longing to do so was strong on us.
052	1TH	002	018	That was why we made up our minds to go and see you – at least I, Paul, did, more than once – but Satan put difficulties in our way.
052	1TH	002	019	For what hope or joy will be ours, or what crown will we have to boast of, in the presence of our Lord Jesus, at his coming, if it isn’t you?
052	1TH	002	020	You are our pride and our delight!
052	1TH	003	001	And so, as we could bear it no longer, we made up our minds to remain behind alone at Athens,
052	1TH	003	002	and sent Timothy, our dear friend and God’s minister of the good news of the Christ, to strengthen you, and to encourage you in your faith,
052	1TH	003	003	so that none of you should be shaken by the troubles through which you are passing. You yourselves know that we are destined to meet with such things.
052	1TH	003	004	For, even while we were with you, we warned you beforehand that we were certain to encounter trouble. And so it proved, as you know.
052	1TH	003	005	Therefore, since I could no longer endure the uncertainty, I sent to make inquiries about your faith, fearing that the Tempter had tempted you, and that our toil might prove to have been in vain.
052	1TH	003	006	But, when Timothy recently returned to us from you with good news of your faith and love, and told us how kindly you think of us – always longing, he said, to see us, just as we are longing to see you –
052	1TH	003	007	on hearing this, we felt encouraged about you, friends, in the midst of all our difficulties and troubles, by your faith.
052	1TH	003	008	For it is new life to us to know that you are holding fast to the Lord.
052	1TH	003	009	How can we thank God enough for all the happiness that you are giving us in the sight of our God?
052	1TH	003	010	Night and day we pray most earnestly that we may see you face to face, and make good any deficiency in your faith.
052	1TH	003	011	May our God and Father himself, and Jesus, our Lord, make the way plain for us to come to you.
052	1TH	003	012	And for you, may the Lord fill you to overflowing with love for one another and for everyone, just as we are filled with love for you;
052	1TH	003	013	and so make your hearts strong, and your lives pure beyond reproach, in the sight of our God and Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus, with all his Holy Ones.
052	1TH	004	001	Further, friends, we beg and urge you in the name of our Lord Jesus to carry out more fully than ever – as indeed you are already doing – all that you have heard from us as to what your daily life must be, if it is to please God.
052	1TH	004	002	For you have not forgotten the directions that we gave you on the authority of our Lord Jesus.
052	1TH	004	003	For this is God’s purpose – that you should be pure; abstaining from all immorality;
052	1TH	004	004	each of you learning to gain control over your own body, in a way that is holy and honourable,
052	1TH	004	005	and not for the mere gratification of your passions, like the Gentiles who know nothing of God;
052	1TH	004	006	none of you overreaching or taking advantage of their fellow follower of the Lord in such matters. The Lord takes vengeance on all who do such things, as we have already warned you and solemnly declared.
052	1TH	004	007	For God does not call us to an impure life, but demands holiness.
052	1TH	004	008	Therefore the person who disregards this warning disregards, not people, but God who gives you his Holy Spirit.
052	1TH	004	009	As to love for each other there is no need to write to you; for you have yourselves been taught by God to love one another;
052	1TH	004	010	and indeed you do act in this spirit towards all his people throughout Macedonia. Yet, friends, we beg you to do even more.
052	1TH	004	011	Make it your ambition to live quietly, and to attend to your own business, and to work with your hands, as we directed you;
052	1TH	004	012	so that your conduct may win respect from those outside the church, and that you may not want for anything.
052	1TH	004	013	We don’t want you to be ignorant, friends, about those who have passed to their rest. We don’t want you to grieve like other people who have no hope.
052	1TH	004	014	For, as we believe that Jesus died and rose again, so also we believe that God will bring, with Jesus, those who through him have passed to their rest.
052	1TH	004	015	This we tell you on the authority of the Lord – that those of us who are still living at the coming of the Lord will not anticipate those who have passed to their rest.
052	1TH	004	016	For, with a loud summons, with the shout of an archangel, and with the trumpet-call of God, the Lord himself will come down from heaven.
052	1TH	004	017	Then those who died in union with Christ will rise first; and afterwards we who are still living will be caught up in the clouds, with them, to meet the Lord in the air; and so we will be for ever with the Lord.
052	1TH	004	018	Therefore, comfort one another with what I have told you.
052	1TH	005	001	But as to the times and the moments, there is no need, friends, for anyone to write to you.
052	1TH	005	002	You yourselves know well that the day of the Lord will come just as a thief comes in the night.
052	1TH	005	003	When people are saying “All is quiet and safe,” it is then that, like birth pains on a pregnant woman, ruin comes suddenly upon them, and there will be no escape!
052	1TH	005	004	You, however, friends, are not in darkness, that the daylight should take you by surprise as if you were thieves.
052	1TH	005	005	For you all are children of light and children of the day. We have nothing to do with night, or darkness.
052	1TH	005	006	Therefore let us not sleep as others do. No, let us be watchful and self-controlled.
052	1TH	005	007	It is at night that people sleep, and at night that drunkards get drunk.
052	1TH	005	008	But let us, who belong to the day, control ourselves, and put on faith and love as a breast plate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet.
052	1TH	005	009	For God destined us, not for wrath, but to win salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, who died for us,
052	1TH	005	010	that, whether we are still watching or have fallen asleep, we may live with him.
052	1TH	005	011	Therefore encourage one another, and try to build up one another’s characters, as indeed you are doing.
052	1TH	005	012	We beg you, friends, to value those who toil among you, and are your leaders in the Lord’s service, and give you counsel.
052	1TH	005	013	Hold them in the very greatest esteem and affection for the sake of their work. Live at peace with one another.
052	1TH	005	014	We entreat you also, friends – warn the disorderly, comfort the faint-hearted, give a helping hand to the weak, and be patient with everyone.
052	1TH	005	015	Take care that none of you ever pays back wrong for wrong, but always follow the kindest course with one another and with everyone.
052	1TH	005	016	Always be joyful;
052	1TH	005	017	never cease to pray;
052	1TH	005	018	under all circumstances give thanks to God. For this is his will for you as made known in Christ Jesus.
052	1TH	005	019	Do not quench the Spirit;
052	1TH	005	020	do not make light of preaching.
052	1TH	005	021	Bring everything to the test; cling to what is good;
052	1TH	005	022	shun every form of evil.
052	1TH	005	023	May God himself, the giver of peace, make you altogether holy; and may your spirits, souls, and bodies be kept altogether faultless until the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
052	1TH	005	024	He who calls you will not fail you; he will complete his work.
052	1TH	005	025	Friends, pray for us.
052	1TH	005	026	Greet all the Lord’s followers with a sacred kiss.
052	1TH	005	027	I order you in the Lord’s name to have this letter read to all the brethren.
052	1TH	005	028	May the blessing of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.

# BOOK	053	2TH	2 Thessalonians	2 Thessalonians
053	2TH	001	001	To the Thessalonian church in union with God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, From Paul, Silas, and Timothy.
053	2TH	001	002	May God, the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you and give you peace.
053	2TH	001	003	Friends, it is our duty always to thank God about you, as is but right, considering the wonderful growth of your faith, and because, without exception, your love for one another is continually increasing.
053	2TH	001	004	So much is this the case that we ourselves speak with pride, before the churches of God, of the patience and faith which you have shown, in spite of all the persecutions and troubles that you are enduring.
053	2TH	001	005	These persecutions will vindicate the justice of God’s judgment, and will result in your being reckoned worthy of God’s kingdom, for the sake of which you are now suffering;
053	2TH	001	006	since God deems it just to inflict suffering on those who are now inflicting suffering on you,
053	2TH	001	007	and to give relief to you who are suffering, as well as to us, at the appearing of the Lord Jesus from heaven with his mighty angels, in flaming fire.
053	2TH	001	008	Then he will inflict punishment on those who refuse to know God, and on those who turn a deaf ear to the good news of Jesus, our Lord.
053	2TH	001	009	They will pay the penalty of unutterable ruin – banished from the presence of the Lord and from the glorious manifestation of his might,
053	2TH	001	010	when he comes to be honoured in his people, and to be revered in all who have learned to believe in him (for you also believed our testimony) – as he will be on that day.
053	2TH	001	011	With this in view, our constant prayer for you is that our God may count you worthy of the call that you have received, and by his power make perfect your delight in all goodness and the efforts that have resulted from your faith.
053	2TH	001	012	Then, in the loving kindness of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ, will the name of Jesus, our Lord, be honoured in you, and you in him.
053	2TH	002	001	As to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and our being gathered to meet him, we beg you, friends,
053	2TH	002	002	not lightly to let your minds become unsettled or disturbed by any revelation, or by any message or letter purporting to come from us, to the effect that the day of the Lord is come.
053	2TH	002	003	Don’t let anyone deceive you in any way. For it will not come before the final rebellion against God, when lawlessness is revealed in human form, headed for destruction.
053	2TH	002	004	He is the adversary of everything that is spoken of as a god or as an object of worship, enthroning himself in God”s Temple claiming to be God!
053	2TH	002	005	Don’t you remember how, when I was with you, I used to speak to you of all this?
053	2TH	002	006	And you know now what the restraining influence is which prevents his appearing before his appointed time.
053	2TH	002	007	Wickedness, indeed, is already at work in secret, but only until he who at present restrains it is removed out of the way.
053	2TH	002	008	Then the lawless person will be revealed, but the Lord Jesus will destroy him with the breath of his mouth, annihilate him by the splendour of his coming.
053	2TH	002	009	When the lawless person comes, there will be great activity on the part of Satan, in the form of all kinds of deceptive miracles, signs, and marvels, as well as of wicked attempts to delude –
053	2TH	002	010	to the ruin of those who are on the path to destruction, because they have never received and loved the truth to their own salvation.
053	2TH	002	011	That is why God places them under the influence of a delusion, to cause them to believe a lie;
053	2TH	002	012	so that sentence may be passed on all those who refuse to believe the truth, but delight in wickedness.
053	2TH	002	013	But, friends, whom the Lord loves, it is our duty always to thank God about you, for, from the first, God chose you for salvation through the purifying influence of the Spirit, and your belief in the truth.
053	2TH	002	014	To this you were called by the good news which we brought you, to attain to the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
053	2TH	002	015	Stand firm then, friends, and hold fast to the truths that we taught you, whether by word or by letter.
053	2TH	002	016	And may our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God our Father, who loved us and, in his loving kindness, gave us unfailing consolation and good ground for hope,
053	2TH	002	017	console your hearts, and strengthen you to do and to say all that is right.
053	2TH	003	001	In conclusion, friends, pray for us – pray that the Lord’s message may spread rapidly, and be received everywhere with honour, as it was among you;
053	2TH	003	002	and that we may be preserved from wrong-headed and wicked people – for it is not everyone who believes in Christ.
053	2TH	003	003	But the Lord will not fail you. He will give you strength, and guard you from evil.
053	2TH	003	004	Yes, and the confidence that our union with the Lord enables us to place in you leads us to believe that you are doing, and will do, what we direct you.
053	2TH	003	005	May the Lord bring you to the love of God, and to the patience of the Christ.
053	2TH	003	006	We beg you, friends, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, to avoid any follower who is living an ill-ordered life, which is not in agreement with the teaching that you received from us.
053	2TH	003	007	For you know well that you ought to follow our example. When we were with you, our life was not ill-ordered,
053	2TH	003	008	nor did we eat anyone’s bread without paying for it. Night and day, labouring and toiling, we used to work at our trades, so as not to be a burden on any of you.
053	2TH	003	009	This was not because we had not a right to receive support, but our object was to give you a pattern for you to copy.
053	2TH	003	010	Indeed, when we were with you, the rule we laid down was – “Whoever does not choose to work will not get to eat.”
053	2TH	003	011	We hear that there are among you people who are living ill-ordered lives, and who, instead of attending to their own business, are mere busybodies.
053	2TH	003	012	All such people we beg, and implore, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, to attend quietly to their business, and earn their own living.
053	2TH	003	013	You, friends, must not grow weary of doing what is right.
053	2TH	003	014	If anyone disregards what we have said in this letter, take note of them and avoid their company, so that they may feel ashamed.
053	2TH	003	015	Yet do not think of them as an enemy, but caution them as you would a brother or sister.
053	2TH	003	016	May the Lord, from whom all peace comes, himself give you his peace at all times and in all ways. May he be with you all.
053	2TH	003	017	I, Paul, add this greeting in my own handwriting. It is my signature to every letter. This is how I write.
053	2TH	003	018	May the blessing of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.

# BOOK	054	1TI	1 Timothy	1 Timothy
054	1TI	001	001	From Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the appointment of God, our Saviour, and Christ Jesus, our hope.
054	1TI	001	002	To Timothy, my true child in the faith: May God, the Father, and Christ Jesus, our Lord, bless you, and be merciful to you, and give you peace.
054	1TI	001	003	I beg you, as I did when I was on my way into Macedonia, to remain at Ephesus; so that you may instruct certain people there not to teach new and strange doctrines,
054	1TI	001	004	nor to devote their attention to legends and interminable genealogies, which tend to give rise to argument rather than to further that divine plan which is revealed in the faith.
054	1TI	001	005	The object of all instruction is to call forth that love which comes from a pure heart, a clear conscience, and a sincere faith.
054	1TI	001	006	And it is because they have not aimed at these things that the attention of certain people has been diverted to unprofitable subjects.
054	1TI	001	007	They want to be teachers of the Law, and yet do not understand either the words they use, or the subjects on which they speak so confidently.
054	1TI	001	008	We know, of course, that the Law is excellent, when used legitimately,
054	1TI	001	009	by one who recognises that laws were not made for good people, but for the lawless and disorderly, for irreligious and wicked people, for those who are irreverent and profane, for those who ill-treat their fathers or mothers, for murderers,
054	1TI	001	010	for the immoral, for perverts, for slave traders, for liars, for perjurers, and for whatever else is opposed to sound Christian teaching –
054	1TI	001	011	as is taught in the glorious good news of the ever-blessed God, with which I was entrusted.
054	1TI	001	012	I am thankful to Christ Jesus, our Lord, who has been my strength, for showing that he thought me worthy of trust by appointing me to his ministry,
054	1TI	001	013	though I once used to blaspheme, and to persecute, and to insult. Yet mercy was shown me, because I acted in ignorance, while still an unbeliever;
054	1TI	001	014	and the loving kindness of our Lord was boundless, and filled me with that faith and love which come from union with Christ Jesus.
054	1TI	001	015	How true the saying is, and worthy of the fullest acceptance, that “Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners”! And there is no greater sinner than I!
054	1TI	001	016	Yet mercy was shown me for the express purpose that Christ Jesus might exhibit in my case, beyond all others, his exhaustless patience, as an example for those who were afterwards to believe on him and attain eternal life.
054	1TI	001	017	To the eternal King, ever-living, invisible, the one God, be ascribed honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.
054	1TI	001	018	This, then, is the charge that I lay on you, Timothy, my child, in accordance with what was predicted of you – Fight the good fight in the spirit of those predictions,
054	1TI	001	019	with faith, and with a clear conscience; and it is because they have thrust this aside, that, as regards the faith, some have wrecked their lives.
054	1TI	001	020	Hymenaeus and Alexander are instances – the men whom I delivered over to Satan so that they might be taught not to blaspheme.
054	1TI	002	001	First of all, then, I ask that petitions, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings should be offered for everyone,
054	1TI	002	002	especially for kings and all who are in high positions, in order that we may lead a quiet and peaceful life in a deeply religious and reverent spirit.
054	1TI	002	003	This will be good and acceptable in the eyes of God, our Saviour,
054	1TI	002	004	whose will is that everyone should be saved, and attain to a full knowledge of the truth.
054	1TI	002	005	There is but one God, and one mediator between God and humanity – the human, Christ Jesus,
054	1TI	002	006	who gave himself as a ransom on behalf of all. This must be our testimony, as opportunities present themselves;
054	1TI	002	007	and it was for this that I was myself appointed a herald and an apostle (I am telling the simple truth and no lie) – a teacher of the Gentiles in the faith and truth.
054	1TI	002	008	My desire, then, is that it should be the custom everywhere for the men to lead the prayers, with hands reverently uplifted, avoiding heated controversy.
054	1TI	002	009	I also desire that women should adorn themselves with appropriate dress, worn quietly and modestly, and not with wreaths or gold ornaments for the hair, or pearls, or costly clothing,
054	1TI	002	010	but – as is proper for women who profess to be religious – with good actions.
054	1TI	002	011	They must learn, listening quietly to their teachers and showing them all deference.
054	1TI	002	012	I do not consent to them becoming teachers, or exercising authority over men; they ought to not make a fuss.
054	1TI	002	013	Adam was formed first, not Eve.
054	1TI	002	014	And it was not Adam who was deceived; it was the woman who was entirely deceived and fell into sin.
054	1TI	002	015	But she will be saved by the birth of a child, if they never abandon faith, love, or holiness, and behave with modesty.
054	1TI	003	001	How true is this saying: “To aspire to be to be a supervisor in the church is to be ambitious for a noble task.”
054	1TI	003	002	The supervisor should be of blameless character; a faithful partner; living a temperate, discreet, and well-ordered life; hospitable, and a skilful teacher,
054	1TI	003	003	not addicted to drink or brawling, but of a forbearing and peaceable disposition, and not a lover of money;
054	1TI	003	004	they should provide for their own household well, and their children should kept under control and be well-behaved.
054	1TI	003	005	If someone does not know how to provide for their own household, how can they take charge of the church of God?
054	1TI	003	006	The supervisor should not be a recent convert, or they might become blinded by pride and fall under the same judgement as the devil.
054	1TI	003	007	They should also be well spoken of by outsiders, so that they may not incur censure and so fall into the devil’s trap.
054	1TI	003	008	So, too, assistants should be serious and straightforward, not given to taking much drink or to questionable money-making,
054	1TI	003	009	but people who hold the deep truths of the faith and have a clear conscience.
054	1TI	003	010	They should be tested first, and only appointed to their office if no objection is raised against them.
054	1TI	003	011	It should be the same with the women in this office. They should be serious, not gossips, sober, and trustworthy in all respects.
054	1TI	003	012	Assistants should be faithful partners who manage their children and their households well.
054	1TI	003	013	Those who have filled that post with honour gain for themselves an honourable position, as well as great confidence through the faith that they place in Christ Jesus.
054	1TI	003	014	I am writing this to you, though I hope that I will come to see you before long;
054	1TI	003	015	but in case I should be delayed, I want you to know what your conduct ought to be in the household of God, which is the church of the living God – the pillar and stay of the truth.
054	1TI	003	016	Yes, and undeniably wonderful are the deep truths of our religion; for – “He was revealed in our nature, pronounced righteous in spirit, seen by angels, proclaimed among the Gentiles, believed on in the world, taken up into glory.”
054	1TI	004	001	But the Spirit distinctly says that in later times there will be some who will fall away from the faith, and devote their attention to misleading spirits, and to the teaching of demons,
054	1TI	004	002	who will make use of the hypocrisy of lying teachers. These people’s consciences are seared,
054	1TI	004	003	and they discourage marriage and enjoin abstinence from certain kinds of food; though God created these foods to be enjoyed thankfully by those who hold the faith and have attained a full knowledge of the truth.
054	1TI	004	004	Everything created by God is good, and there in nothing that need be rejected – provided only that it is received thankfully;
054	1TI	004	005	for it is consecrated by God’s blessing and by prayer.
054	1TI	004	006	Put all this before the followers, and you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, sustained by the precepts of the faith and of that good teaching by which you have guided your life.
054	1TI	004	007	As for profane legends and old wives’ tales, leave them alone. Train yourself to lead a religious life;
054	1TI	004	008	for while the training of the body is of service in some respects, religion is of service in all, carrying with it, as it does, a promise of life both here and hereafter.
054	1TI	004	009	How true that saying is and worthy of the fullest acceptance!
054	1TI	004	010	With that aim we toil and struggle, for we have set our hopes on the living God, who is the Saviour of all, and especially of those who hold the faith.
054	1TI	004	011	Remember these things in your teaching.
054	1TI	004	012	Do not let anyone look down on you because you are young, but, by your conversation, your conduct, your love, your faith, and your purity, be an example to those who hold the faith.
054	1TI	004	013	Until I come, apply yourself to public reading, preaching, and teaching.
054	1TI	004	014	Do not neglect the divine gift within you, which was given you, amid many a prediction, when the hands of the church elders were laid on your head.
054	1TI	004	015	Practice these things, devote yourself to them, so that your progress may be plain to everyone.
054	1TI	004	016	Look to yourself as well as to your teaching. Persevere in this, for your doing so will mean salvation for yourself as well as for your hearers.
054	1TI	005	001	Do not reprimand an older man, but plead with him as if he were your father. Treat the young men as brothers,
054	1TI	005	002	the older women as mothers, and the younger women as sisters – with all purity.
054	1TI	005	003	Show consideration for widows – I mean those who are really widowed.
054	1TI	005	004	But, if a widow has children or grandchildren, they should learn to show proper regard for the members of their own family first, and to make some return to their parents; for that is pleasing in God’s sight.
054	1TI	005	005	As for the woman who is really widowed and left quite alone, her hopes are fixed on God, and she devotes herself to prayers and supplications night and day.
054	1TI	005	006	But the life of a widow who is devoted to pleasure is a living death.
054	1TI	005	007	Those are the points you should teach, so that there may be no call for your censure.
054	1TI	005	008	Anyone who fails to provide for their own relatives, and especially for those under their own roof, has disowned the faith, and is worse than an unbeliever.
054	1TI	005	009	A widow, when her name is added to the list, should not be less than sixty years old; she should have been a faithful wife,
054	1TI	005	010	and be well spoken of for her kind actions. She should have brought up children, have shown hospitality to strangers, have washed the feet of her fellow Christians, have relieved those who were in distress, and devoted herself to every kind of good action.
054	1TI	005	011	But you should exclude the younger widows from the list; for, when they grow restive under the yoke of the Christ, they want to marry,
054	1TI	005	012	and so they bring condemnation on themselves for having broken their previous promise.
054	1TI	005	013	And not only that, but they learn to be idle as they go about from house to house. Nor are they merely idle, but they also become gossips and busybodies, and talk of what they ought not.
054	1TI	005	014	Therefore I advise young widows to marry, bear children, and attend to their homes, and so avoid giving the enemy an opportunity for scandal.
054	1TI	005	015	There are some who have already left us, to follow Satan.
054	1TI	005	016	Any Christian woman, who has relatives who are widows, ought to relieve them and not allow them to become a burden to the church, so that the church may relieve those widows who are really widowed.
054	1TI	005	017	Those church elders who fill their office well should be held deserving of especial consideration, particularly those whose work lies in preaching and teaching.
054	1TI	005	018	The words of scripture are – “You should not muzzle the ox while it is treading out the grain.” and again – “The worker is worth their wages.”
054	1TI	005	019	Do not entertain a charge against an church elder, unless it is supported by two or three witnesses;
054	1TI	005	020	but rebuke offenders publicly, so that others may take warning.
054	1TI	005	021	I charge you solemnly, before God and Christ Jesus and the chosen angels, to carry out these directions, unswayed by prejudice, never acting with partiality.
054	1TI	005	022	Never ordain anyone hastily, and take no part in the wrongdoing of others. Keep your life pure.
054	1TI	005	023	Do not continue to drink water only, but take a little wine because of the weakness of your stomach, and your frequent ailments.
054	1TI	005	024	There are some people whose sins are conspicuous and lead on to judgment, while there are others whose sins dog their steps.
054	1TI	005	025	In the same way noble deeds become conspicuous, and those which are otherwise cannot be concealed.
054	1TI	006	001	All who are in the position of slaves should regard their masters as deserving of the greatest respect, so that the name of God, and our teaching, may not be maligned.
054	1TI	006	002	Those who have Christian masters should not think less of them because they are also followers of Christ, but on the contrary they should serve them all the better, because those who are to benefit by their good work are dear to them as their fellow Christians.
054	1TI	006	003	Anyone who teaches otherwise, and refuses their assent to sound instruction – the instruction of our Lord Jesus Christ – and to the teaching of religion,
054	1TI	006	004	is puffed up with conceit, not really knowing anything, but having a morbid craving for discussions and arguments. Such things only give rise to envy, quarrelling, recriminations, base suspicions,
054	1TI	006	005	and incessant wrangling on the part of these corrupt-minded people who have lost all hold on the truth, and who think of religion only as a source of gain.
054	1TI	006	006	Of course religion is a great source of gain – when combined with contentment!
054	1TI	006	007	For we brought nothing into the world, because we cannot even carry anything out of it.
054	1TI	006	008	So, with food and shelter, we will be content.
054	1TI	006	009	Those who want to be rich fall into the net of temptation, and become the prey of many foolish and harmful ambitions, which plunge people into destruction and ruin.
054	1TI	006	010	Love of money is a source of all kinds of evil; and in their eagerness to be rich some have wandered away from the faith, and have been pierced to the heart by many a regret.
054	1TI	006	011	But you must, servant of God, avoid all this. Aim at righteousness, piety, faith, love, endurance, gentleness.
054	1TI	006	012	Run the great race of the faith, and win the eternal life. It was for this that you received the call, and, in the presence of many witnesses, made the great profession of faith.
054	1TI	006	013	I beg you, as in the sight of God, the source of all life, and of Christ Jesus who before Pontius Pilate made the great profession of faith –
054	1TI	006	014	I implore you to keep his command free from stain or reproach, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ.
054	1TI	006	015	This will be brought about in his own time by the one ever-blessed Potentate, the king of all kings and Lord of all lords,
054	1TI	006	016	who alone is possessed of immortality and dwells in unapproachable light, whom no one has ever seen or ever can see – to whom be ascribed honour and power for ever. Amen.
054	1TI	006	017	Teach those who are wealthy in this life not to pride themselves, or fix their hopes, on so uncertain a thing as wealth, but on God, who gives us a wealth of enjoyment on every side.
054	1TI	006	018	Teach them to show kindness, to exhibit a wealth of good actions, to be open-handed and generous,
054	1TI	006	019	storing up for themselves what in the future will prove to be a good foundation, so that they may gain the only true life.
054	1TI	006	020	Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to you. Avoid the profane prattle and contradictions of what some miscall “theology,”
054	1TI	006	021	for there are those who, while asserting their proficiency in it, have yet, as regards the faith, gone altogether astray. God bless you all.

# BOOK	055	2TI	2 Timothy	2 Timothy
055	2TI	001	001	From Paul who, by the will of God, is an apostle of Christ Jesus, charged to proclaim the life that comes from union with Christ Jesus,
055	2TI	001	002	to Timothy, my dear child: may God, the Father, and Christ Jesus, our Lord, bless you, and be merciful to you, and give you peace.
055	2TI	001	003	I am thankful to God, whom I serve, as my ancestors did, with a clear conscience, when I remember you, as I never fail to do, in my prayers – night and day alike,
055	2TI	001	004	as I think of your tears, longing to see you, that my happiness may be completed,
055	2TI	001	005	now that I have been reminded of the sincere faith that you have shown. That faith was seen first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and is now, I am convinced, in you also.
055	2TI	001	006	And that is my reason for reminding you to stir into flame that gift of God, which is yours through your ordination at my hands.
055	2TI	001	007	For the Spirit which God gave us was not a spirit of cowardice, but a spirit of power, love, and self-control.
055	2TI	001	008	Do not, therefore, be ashamed of the testimony which we have to bear to our Lord, or of me imprisoned for his sake; but join with me in suffering for the good news, as far as God enables you.
055	2TI	001	009	It was God who saved us, and from him we received our solemn call – not as a reward for anything that we had done, but in fulfilment of his own loving purpose. For that love was extended to us, through Christ Jesus, before time began,
055	2TI	001	010	and has now been made apparent through the appearing of our Saviour, Christ Jesus; who has made an end of death, and has brought life and immortality to light by that good news,
055	2TI	001	011	of which I was myself appointed a herald, apostle, and teacher.
055	2TI	001	012	That is why I am undergoing these sufferings; yet I feel no shame, for I know in whom I have put my faith, and am convinced that he is able to guard what I have entrusted to him until that day.
055	2TI	001	013	Keep before you, as an example of sound teaching, all that you learnt from me as you listened with that faith and love which come from union with Christ Jesus.
055	2TI	001	014	Guard by the help of the Holy Spirit, who is within us, the glorious trust that has been committed to you.
055	2TI	001	015	You know, of course, that all our friends in Roman Asia turned their backs on me, including Phygellus and Hermogenes.
055	2TI	001	016	May the Lord show mercy to the household of Onesiphorus; for he often cheered me and was not ashamed of my chains.
055	2TI	001	017	On the contrary, when he arrived in Rome, he sought eagerly for me until he found me.
055	2TI	001	018	The Lord grant that he may find mercy at the hands of the Lord on that day. The many services that he rendered at Ephesus you have the best means of knowing.
055	2TI	002	001	You must, then, my child, find strength in the help which comes from the union with Christ Jesus;
055	2TI	002	002	and what you learnt from me, in the presence of many listeners, entrust to reliable people, who will be able in their turn to teach others.
055	2TI	002	003	Share hardships with me, as a true soldier of Christ Jesus.
055	2TI	002	004	A soldier on active service, to please his superior officer, always avoids entangling himself in the affairs of ordinary life.
055	2TI	002	005	No athlete is ever awarded the wreath of victory unless they have kept the rules.
055	2TI	002	006	The labourer who does the work should be the first to receive a share of the fruits of the earth.
055	2TI	002	007	Reflect on what I say; the Lord will always help you to understand.
055	2TI	002	008	Keep before your mind Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, a descendant of David, as told in the good news entrusted to me;
055	2TI	002	009	in the service of which I am suffering hardships, even to being put in fetters as a criminal. But the message of God is not fettered;
055	2TI	002	010	and that is why I submit to anything for the sake of God’s people: so that they also may obtain the salvation which comes from union with Christ Jesus, and imperishable glory.
055	2TI	002	011	How true this saying is – “If we have shared his death, we will also share his life.
055	2TI	002	012	If we continue to endure, we will also share his throne. If we should ever disown him, he, too, will disown us.
055	2TI	002	013	If we lose our trust, he is still to be trusted, for he cannot be false to himself!”
055	2TI	002	014	Remind people of all this; tell them solemnly, as in the sight of God, to avoid controversy, a useless thing and the ruin of those who listen to it.
055	2TI	002	015	Do your utmost to show yourself true to God, a worker with no reason to be ashamed, accurate in delivering the message of the truth.
055	2TI	002	016	Avoid profane prattle. Those who indulge in it only get deeper into irreligious ways,
055	2TI	002	017	and their teaching will spread like a cancer. Hymenaeus and Philetus are instances of this.
055	2TI	002	018	They have gone completely astray as regards the truth; they say that a resurrection has already taken place, and so upset some people’s faith.
055	2TI	002	019	Yet God’s firm foundation still stands unmoved, and it bears this inscription – “THE LORD KNOWS THOSE WHO ARE HIS”; and this – “LET ALL THOSE WHO USE THE NAME OF THE LORD TURN AWAY FROM WICKEDNESS.”
055	2TI	002	020	Now in a large house there are not only things of gold and silver, but also others of wood and earthenware, some for better and some for common use.
055	2TI	002	021	If, then, a person has escaped from the pollution of such errors as I have mentioned, they will be like a thing kept for better use, set apart, serviceable to its owner, ready for any good purpose.
055	2TI	002	022	Flee from the passions of youth, but pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace, in the company of those who, with a pure heart, invoke the Lord.
055	2TI	002	023	Shun foolish and ignorant discussions, for you know that they only breed quarrels;
055	2TI	002	024	and a servant of the Lord should never quarrel. They ought, on the contrary, to be courteous to everyone, skilful teachers, and forbearing.
055	2TI	002	025	They should instruct their opponents in a gentle spirit; for, possibly, God may give those opponents a repentance that will lead to a fuller knowledge of truth,
055	2TI	002	026	and they may yet come to a sober mind, and escape from the devil’s net, when captured by the Lord’s servant to do the will of God.
055	2TI	003	001	Be sure of this, that in the last days difficult times will come.
055	2TI	003	002	People will be selfish, mercenary, boastful, haughty, and blasphemous; disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, impure,
055	2TI	003	003	incapable of affection, merciless, slanderous, wanting in self-control, brutal, careless of the right,
055	2TI	003	004	treacherous, reckless, and puffed up with pride; they will love pleasure more than they love God;
055	2TI	003	005	and while they retain the outward form of religion, they will not allow it to influence them. Turn your back on such people as these.
055	2TI	003	006	For among them are to be found those who creep into homes and captivate weak women – women who, loaded with sins, and slaves to all kinds of passions,
055	2TI	003	007	are always learning, and yet never able to attain to a real knowledge of the truth.
055	2TI	003	008	Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so do these people, in their turn, oppose the truth. Their minds are corrupted, and, as regards the faith, they are utterly worthless.
055	2TI	003	009	They will not, however, make further progress; for their wicked folly will be plain to everyone, just as the folly Jannes and Jambres was.
055	2TI	003	010	But you, Timothy, were a close observer of my teaching, my conduct, my purposes, my faith, my forbearance, my love, and my patient endurance,
055	2TI	003	011	as well as of my persecutions, and of the sufferings which I met with at Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. You know what persecutions I underwent; and yet the Lord brought me safe out of all!
055	2TI	003	012	Yes, and all who aim at living a religious life in union with Christ Jesus will have to suffer persecution;
055	2TI	003	013	but wicked people and impostors will go from bad to worse, deceiving others and deceived themselves.
055	2TI	003	014	You, however, must stand by what you learnt and accepted as true. You know who they were from whom you learnt it;
055	2TI	003	015	and that, from your childhood, you have known the sacred writings, which can give you the wisdom that, through belief in Christ Jesus, leads to salvation.
055	2TI	003	016	All scripture is God-breathed: helpful for teaching, for refuting error, for giving guidance, and for training others in righteousness;
055	2TI	003	017	so that God’s people may be capable and equipped for good work of every kind.
055	2TI	004	001	I solemnly charge you – in the sight of God and of Christ Jesus, who will one day judge the living and the dead – I charge you by his appearing and by his kingdom:
055	2TI	004	002	Proclaim the message, be ready in season and out of season, convince, rebuke, encourage, never failing to instruct with forbearance.
055	2TI	004	003	For a time will come when people will not tolerate sound teaching. They will follow their own wishes, and, in their itching for novelty, procure themselves a crowd of teachers.
055	2TI	004	004	They will turn a deaf ear to the truth, and give their attention to legends instead.
055	2TI	004	005	But you, Timothy, must always be temperate. Face hardships; do the work of a missionary; discharge all the duties of your office.
055	2TI	004	006	As for me, my life blood is already being poured out; the time of my departure is close at hand.
055	2TI	004	007	I have run the great race; I have finished the course; I have kept the faith.
055	2TI	004	008	And now the crown of righteousness awaits me, which the Lord, the just judge, will give me on that day – and not only to me, but to all who have loved his appearing.
055	2TI	004	009	Do your utmost to come to me soon,
055	2TI	004	010	for Demas, in his love for the world, has deserted me. He has gone to Thessalonica, Crescens to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia.
055	2TI	004	011	There is no one but Luke with me. Pick up Mark on your way, and bring him with you, for he is useful to me in my work.
055	2TI	004	012	I have sent Tychicus to Ephesus.
055	2TI	004	013	Bring with you, when you come, the cloak which I left at Troas with Carpus, and the books, especially the parchments.
055	2TI	004	014	Alexander, the coppersmith, showed much ill feeling towards me. The Lord will give him what his actions deserve.
055	2TI	004	015	You must also be on your guard against him, for he is strongly opposed to our teaching.
055	2TI	004	016	At my first trial no one stood by me. They all deserted me. May it never be counted against them!
055	2TI	004	017	But the Lord came to my help and strengthened me, in order that, through me, the proclamation should be made so widely that all the Gentiles should hear it; and I was rescued out of the lion’s mouth.
055	2TI	004	018	The Lord will rescue me from all evil, and bring me safe into his Heavenly kingdom. All glory to him for ever and ever! Amen.
055	2TI	004	019	Give my greeting to Prisca and Aquila, and to the household of Onesiphorus.
055	2TI	004	020	Erastus remained at Corinth, and I left Thophimus ill at Miletus.
055	2TI	004	021	Do your utmost to come before winter. Eubulus, Pudens, Linus and Claudia send you their greetings, and so do the rest of the Lord’s followers.
055	2TI	004	022	May the Lord be with your soul. God bless you all.

# BOOK	056	TIT	Titus	Titus
056	TIT	001	001	From Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, on behalf of the faith of God’s chosen people, and their knowledge of that truth which makes for godliness
056	TIT	001	002	– and is based on the hope of eternal life, which God, who never lies, promised before the ages began,
056	TIT	001	003	and has revealed at his own time in his message, with the preaching of which I was entrusted by the command of God our Saviour.
056	TIT	001	004	To Titus, my true child in our shared faith: May God, the Father, and Christ Jesus, our Saviour, bless you and give you peace.
056	TIT	001	005	My reason for leaving you in Crete was that you might put in order what had been left unfinished, and appoint church elders in the various towns, as I myself directed you.
056	TIT	001	006	They are to be of irreproachable character, faithful to their partners, whose children are believers in Christ and have never been open to the charge of being wild or unruly.
056	TIT	001	007	For a supervisor, as God’s steward, ought to be of blameless character – not arrogant or quick-tempered, not given to drunkeness, violence or shady money-making.
056	TIT	001	008	Instead, they should be hospitable, love what is good, self-controlled, upright, people of holy life and disciplined,
056	TIT	001	009	holding firmly to the trustworthy message as it has been taught – so that they may be able to encourage others by sound teaching, as well as to refute those who contradict it.
056	TIT	001	010	For there are many undisciplined persons who lead others astray with their nonsense, especially those of the group advocating the necessity of circumcision.
056	TIT	001	011	They need to be kept quiet as they disrupt whole households by teaching what they ought not to teach, simply to make shameful financial gain.
056	TIT	001	012	It was a Cretan – one of their own prophets – who said: “Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, and lazy gluttons.” This statement is true.
056	TIT	001	013	Therefore rebuke them sharply, so that they may be sound in the faith,
056	TIT	001	014	and may pay no attention to Jewish legends, or to the directions of those who turn their backs on the truth.
056	TIT	001	015	To those whose minds are pure, all things are ritually pure, but to those whose minds are tainted and unbelieving nothing is pure, as their minds and consciences are alike polluted.
056	TIT	001	016	They claim to know God, but by their actions they deny him. They are detestable and disobedient and useless for any good work.
056	TIT	002	001	You however, should speak of such subjects as properly have a place in sound teaching.
056	TIT	002	002	Teach that the older men should be soberly clear minded, dignified and self-controlled – sound in faith, love, and patient endurance.
056	TIT	002	003	So, too, that the older women should live reverent lives, not slanderers, not slaves to excessive drinking.
056	TIT	002	004	They should teach what is good, so as to train the younger women to love their husbands and children,
056	TIT	002	005	and to be self-controlled, pure-minded, to be watching over their home, to be kind, respecting the authority of their husbands, so that no one will speak badly of God’s message.
056	TIT	002	006	In the same way with the younger men – encourage them to be self-controlled.
056	TIT	002	007	In all things, set an example of doing good. In your teaching, show integrity and seriousness –
056	TIT	002	008	let the instruction that you give be sound and above reproach, so that those who oppose you may be ashamed when they fail to find anything bad to say about us.
056	TIT	002	009	Tell slaves to respect their owner’s authority in all circumstances, and to try their best to please them.
056	TIT	002	010	Teach them not to contradict or to pilfer, but to show such praiseworthy fidelity in everything, as to recommend the teaching about God our Saviour by all that they do.
056	TIT	002	011	For the loving kindness of God has been revealed, bringing salvation for all,
056	TIT	002	012	leading us to renounce ungodliness and worldly desires, and to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives here in this present age,
056	TIT	002	013	while awaiting our blessed hope – the appearing in glory of our great God and Saviour, Christ Jesus.
056	TIT	002	014	For he gave himself on our behalf, to deliver us from all wickedness, and to purify for himself a people who should be truly his own and eager to do good.
056	TIT	002	015	Tell them of all this, and encourage and rebuke with all authority. Do not let anyone belittle you.
056	TIT	003	001	Remind them to respect and obey the rulers and authorities, to be ready for every kind of good work, to slander no one, to avoid quarrelling,
056	TIT	003	002	to be reasonable, and under all circumstances to show a gentle spirit with all.
056	TIT	003	003	There was a time when we ourselves were foolish, disobedient, misled, enslaved to all kinds of desires and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hating ourselves and hating one another.
056	TIT	003	004	But, when the kindness of God our Saviour and his love for humanity appeared, he saved us,
056	TIT	003	005	not as the result of any righteous actions that we had done, but due to his mercy. He saved us though the washing of rebirth and renewal by the power of the Holy Spirit,
056	TIT	003	006	which he poured out on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour –
056	TIT	003	007	so that, having been put right with God through his grace, we become heirs to the hope of eternal life.
056	TIT	003	008	This saying is trustworthy! And it is on these subjects that I want you to lay special emphasis, so that those who have learned to trust in God may be careful to devote themselves to doing good. Such subjects are excellent in themselves, and of benefit to all.
056	TIT	003	009	But have nothing to do with foolish controversies, or with genealogies, or with quarrels, or fights about the Law. They are useless and futile.
056	TIT	003	010	If someone is causing divisions among you then, after giving them a second warning, excuse yourself from them.
056	TIT	003	011	You can be sure that such a person has forsaken the truth and is in the wrong. They stand self-condemned.
056	TIT	003	012	As soon as I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, join me as quickly as possible at Nicopolis, for I have arranged to spend the winter there.
056	TIT	003	013	Do your best to help Zenas, the teacher of the Law, and Apollos, on their way, and see that they want for nothing.
056	TIT	003	014	Let all our people learn to devote themselves to doing good, so as to meet the most pressing needs, and that their lives may not be unfruitful.
056	TIT	003	015	All who are with me here send you their greeting. Give my greeting to our friends in the faith. God bless you all.

# BOOK	057	PHM	Philemon	Philemon
057	PHM	001	001	From Paul, now a prisoner for Christ Jesus, and from Timothy, a fellow follower of the Lord.
057	PHM	001	002	To our dear friend and fellow worker Philemon, to our sister Apphia, to our fellow soldier Archippus; and to the church that meets at Philemon’s house;
057	PHM	001	003	may God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you and give you peace.
057	PHM	001	004	I always mention you in my prayers and thank God for you,
057	PHM	001	005	because I hear of the love and the faith which you show, not only to the Lord Jesus, but also to all his people;
057	PHM	001	006	and I pray that your participation in the faith may result in action, as you come to a fuller realisation of everything that is good and Christlike in us.
057	PHM	001	007	I have indeed found great joy and encouragement in your love, knowing, as I do, how the hearts of Christ’s people have been cheered, friend, by you.
057	PHM	001	008	And so, though my union with Christ enables me, with all confidence, to dictate the course that you should adopt,
057	PHM	001	009	yet the claims of love make me prefer to plead with you – yes, even me, Paul, though I am an ambassador for Christ Jesus and, now a prisoner for him as well.
057	PHM	001	010	I plead with you for this child of mine, Onesimus, to whom, in my prison, I have become a father.
057	PHM	001	011	Once he was of little service to you, but now he has become of great service, not only to you, but to me as well;
057	PHM	001	012	and I am sending him back to you with this letter – though it is like tearing out of my heart.
057	PHM	001	013	For my own sake I should like to keep him with me, so that, while I am in prison for the good news, he might attend to my wants on your behalf.
057	PHM	001	014	But I do not wish to do anything without your consent, because I want your generosity to be voluntary and not, as it were, compulsory.
057	PHM	001	015	It may be that he was separated from you for an hour, for this reason, so that you might have him back for ever,
057	PHM	001	016	no longer as a slave, but as something better – a dearly loved friend and follower of the Lord, especially dear to me, and how much more so to you, not only as a person, but as your fellow Christian!
057	PHM	001	017	If, then, you count me your friend, receive him as you would me.
057	PHM	001	018	If he has caused you any loss, or owes you anything, charge it to me.
057	PHM	001	019	I, Paul, put my own hand to it – I will repay you myself. I say nothing about your owing me your self.
057	PHM	001	020	Yes, friend, let me gain something from you because of your union with the Lord. Cheer my heart by your Christlike spirit.
057	PHM	001	021	Even as I write, I have such confidence in your compliance with my wishes, that I am sure that you will do even more than I am asking.
057	PHM	001	022	Please also get a lodging ready for me, for I hope that I will be given back to you all in answer to your prayers.
057	PHM	001	023	Epaphras, who is my fellow prisoner for Christ Jesus, sends you his greeting;
057	PHM	001	024	and Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers, send theirs.
057	PHM	001	025	May the blessing of the Lord Jesus Christ rest on your souls.

# BOOK	058	HEB	Hebrews	Hebrews
058	HEB	001	001	God, who, of old, at many times and in many ways, spoke to our ancestors, by the prophets,
058	HEB	001	002	has in these latter days spoken to us by the Son, whom he appointed the heir of all things, and through whom he made the universe.
058	HEB	001	003	For he is the radiance of the glory of God and the expression of his being, upholding all creation by the power of his word; and, when he had made an expiation for the sins of humanity, he took his seat at the right hand of God’s Majesty on high,
058	HEB	001	004	having shown himself as much greater than the angels as the name that he has inherited surpasses theirs.
058	HEB	001	005	For to which of the angels did God ever say – “You are my Son; this day I have become your Father”? or again – “I will be to him a Father, and he will be to me a Son”?
058	HEB	001	006	And again, when God brought the firstborn into the world, he said – “Let all the angels of God bow down before him.”
058	HEB	001	007	Speaking of the angels, he said – “He makes the winds his angels and the flames of fire his servants”;
058	HEB	001	008	while of the Son he said – “God is your throne for ever and ever; the sceptre of his kingdom is the sceptre of Justice;
058	HEB	001	009	You love righteousness and hates iniquity; therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the festal oil more abundantly than your peers.”
058	HEB	001	010	Again – “You, Lord, in the beginning did lay the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands.
058	HEB	001	011	They will perish, but you remain; as a garment they will all grow old;
058	HEB	001	012	As a mantle you will fold them up, and as a garment they will be changed, but you are the same, and your years will know no end.”
058	HEB	001	013	To which of the angels has God ever said – “Sit you at my right hand until I put your enemies as a stool for your feet”?
058	HEB	001	014	Are not all the angels spirits in the service of God, sent out to minister for the sake of those who are destined to obtain salvation?
058	HEB	002	001	Therefore we must give still more heed to what we were taught, so we do not drift away.
058	HEB	002	002	For, if the message which was delivered by angels had its authority confirmed, so that every offence against it, or neglect of it, met with a fitting requital,
058	HEB	002	003	how can we, of all people, expect to escape, if we disregard so great a salvation? It was the Master who at the outset spoke of this salvation, and its authority was confirmed for us by those who heard him,
058	HEB	002	004	while God himself added his testimony to it by signs, and marvels, and many different miracles, as well as by imparting the Holy Spirit as he saw fit.
058	HEB	002	005	God has not given to angels the control of that future world of which we are speaking!
058	HEB	002	006	No; a writer has declared somewhere – “What are mere mortals that you should remember them? Or human beings that you should care for them?
058	HEB	002	007	You have made them, for a while, lower than angels; with glory and honour you have crowned them; you have set them over all that your hands have made;
058	HEB	002	008	you have placed all things beneath their feet.” This “placing of everything” under humanity means that there was nothing which was not placed under them. As yet, however, we do not see everything placed under humanity.
058	HEB	002	009	What our eyes do see is Jesus, who was made for a while lower than angels, now, because of his sufferings and death, crowned with glory and honour; so that his tasting the bitterness of death should, in God’s loving kindness, be on behalf of all humanity.
058	HEB	002	010	It was, indeed, fitting that God, for whom and through whom all things exist, should, when leading many children to glory, make the author of their salvation perfect through suffering.
058	HEB	002	011	For he who purifies, and those whom he purifies, all spring from One; and therefore he is not ashamed to call them his brothers and sisters.
058	HEB	002	012	He says – “I will tell of your name to my brothers and sisters, in the midst of the congregation I will sing your praise.”
058	HEB	002	013	And again – “As for me, I will put my trust in God.” And yet again – “See, here am I and the children whom God gave me.”
058	HEB	002	014	Therefore, since human nature is the common heritage of the children, Jesus also shared it, in order that by death he might render powerless him whose power lies in death – that is, the devil –
058	HEB	002	015	and so might deliver all those who, from fear of death, had all their lives been living in slavery.
058	HEB	002	016	It was not, surely, to the help of the angels that Jesus came, but to the help of the descendants of Abraham.
058	HEB	002	017	And consequently it was necessary that he should in all points be made like his brothers and sisters, in order that he might prove a merciful as well as a faithful high priest in humanity’s relations with God, for the purpose of expiating the sins of his people.
058	HEB	002	018	The fact that he himself suffered under temptation enables him to help those who are tempted.
058	HEB	003	001	Therefore, my Christian friends, you who, all alike, have received the call from heaven, fix your attention on Jesus, the apostle and high priest of our religion.
058	HEB	003	002	See how faithful he was to the God who appointed him, as Moses was in the whole house of God.
058	HEB	003	003	He has been deemed worthy of far higher honour than Moses, just as the founder of the house is held in greater regard than the house itself.
058	HEB	003	004	For every house has its founder, and the founder of the universe is God.
058	HEB	003	005	While the faithful service of Moses in the whole house of God was that of a servant, whose duty was to bear testimony to a message still to come,
058	HEB	003	006	the faithfulness of Christ was that of a son set over the house of God. And we are his house – if only we retain, unshaken to the end, the courage and confidence inspired by our hope.
058	HEB	003	007	Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says – “If today you hear God’s voice,
058	HEB	003	008	harden not your hearts, as when Israel provoked me on the day when they tried my patience in the desert,
058	HEB	003	009	Where your ancestors tried my forbearance, and saw my mighty deeds for forty years.
058	HEB	003	010	Therefore I was sorely vexed with that generation, and I said – ‘Their hearts are always straying; they have never learned my ways’;
058	HEB	003	011	While in my wrath I swore – ‘They will never enter upon my rest.’”
058	HEB	003	012	Be careful, friends, that there is never found in anyone of you a wicked and faithless heart, shown by that person separating themselves from the living God.
058	HEB	003	013	Rather encourage one another daily – while there is a today – to prevent anyone among you from being hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.
058	HEB	003	014	For we now all share in the Christ, if indeed we retain, unshaken to the end, the confidence that we had at the first.
058	HEB	003	015	To use the words of scripture – “If today you hear God’s voice, harden not your hearts, as when Israel provoked me.”
058	HEB	003	016	Who were they who heard God speak and yet provoked him? Were not they all those who left Egypt under the leadership of Moses?
058	HEB	003	017	And with whom was it that God was sorely vexed for forty years? Was not it with those who had sinned, and who fell dead in the desert?
058	HEB	003	018	And who were they to whom God swore that they should not enter upon his rest, if not those who had proved faithless?
058	HEB	003	019	We see, then, that they failed to enter upon it because of their want of faith.
058	HEB	004	001	We must, therefore, be very careful, though there is a promise still standing that we will enter upon God’s rest, that none of you even appear to have missed it.
058	HEB	004	002	For we have had the good news told us just as they had. But the message which they heard did them no good, since they did not share the faith of those who were attentive to it.
058	HEB	004	003	Upon that rest we who have believed are now entering. As God has said – “In my wrath I swore – ‘They will never enter upon my rest;’” Although God’s work was finished at the creation of the world;
058	HEB	004	004	for, in a passage referring to the seventh day, you will find these words – “God rested on the seventh day after all his work.”
058	HEB	004	005	On the other hand, we read in that passage – “They will never enter upon my rest.”
058	HEB	004	006	Since, then, there is still a promise that some will enter upon this rest, and since those who were first told the good news did not enter upon it, because of their disbelief,
058	HEB	004	007	again God fixed a day. “Today,” he said, speaking after a long interval through the mouth of David, in the passage already quoted – “If today you hear God’s voice harden not your hearts.”
058	HEB	004	008	Now if Joshua had given “rest” to the people, God would not have spoken of another and later day.
058	HEB	004	009	There is, then, a Sabbath rest still awaiting God’s people.
058	HEB	004	010	For the person who enters upon God’s rest do themselves rest after their work, just as God did.
058	HEB	004	011	Let us, therefore, make every effort to enter upon that rest, so that none of us fall through such disbelief as that of which we have had an example.
058	HEB	004	012	God’s message is a living and active power, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing its way until it penetrates soul and spirit – not the joints only but the marrow – and detecting the inmost thoughts and purposes of the mind.
058	HEB	004	013	There is no created thing that can hide itself from the sight of God. Everything is exposed and laid bare before the eyes of him to whom we have to give account.
058	HEB	004	014	We have, then, in Jesus, the Son of God, a great high priest who has passed into the highest heaven; let us, therefore, hold fast to the faith which we have professed.
058	HEB	004	015	Our high priest is not one unable to sympathise with our weaknesses, but one who has in every way been tempted, exactly as we have been, but without sinning.
058	HEB	004	016	Therefore, let us draw near boldly to the throne of love, to find pity and love for the hour of need.
058	HEB	005	001	Every high priest, taken from among the people, is appointed as their representative in their relations with God, to offer both gifts and sacrifices in expiation of sins.
058	HEB	005	002	And he is able to sympathise with the ignorant and deluded, since he is himself subject to weakness,
058	HEB	005	003	and is therefore bound to offer sacrifices for sins, not only for the people, but equally so for himself.
058	HEB	005	004	Nor does anyone take that high office on themselves, until they have been called to do so by God, as Aaron was.
058	HEB	005	005	In the same way, even the Christ did not take the honour of the high priesthood on himself, but he was appointed by him who said to him – “You are my Son; this day I have become your Father”;
058	HEB	005	006	and on another occasion also – “You are a priest for all time of the order of Melchizedek.”
058	HEB	005	007	Jesus, in the days of his earthly life, offered prayers and supplications, with earnest cries and with tears, to him who was able to save him from death; and he was heard because of his devout submission.
058	HEB	005	008	Son though he was, he learned obedience from his sufferings;
058	HEB	005	009	and, being made perfect, he became to all those who obey him the source of eternal salvation,
058	HEB	005	010	while God himself pronounced him a high priest of the order of Melchizedek.
058	HEB	005	011	Now on this subject I have much to say, but it is difficult to explain it to you, because you have shown yourselves so slow to learn.
058	HEB	005	012	For whereas, considering the time that has elapsed, you ought to be teaching others, you still need someone to teach you the alphabet of the divine revelation, and need again to be fed with milk instead of with “solid food.”
058	HEB	005	013	For everyone who still has to take milk knows nothing of the teaching of righteousness; they are a mere infant.
058	HEB	005	014	But solid food is for Christians of mature faith – those whose faculties have been trained by practice to distinguish right from wrong.
058	HEB	006	001	Therefore, let us leave behind the elementary teaching about the Christ and press on to perfection, not always laying over again a foundation of repentance for a lifeless formality, of faith in God –
058	HEB	006	002	teaching concerning baptisms and the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead and a final judgment.
058	HEB	006	003	Yes and, with God’s help, we will.
058	HEB	006	004	For if those who were once for all brought into the light, and learned to appreciate the gift from heaven, and came to share in the Holy Spirit,
058	HEB	006	005	and learned to appreciate the beauty of the divine message, and the new powers of the coming age –
058	HEB	006	006	if those, I say, fell away, it would be impossible to bring them again to repentance; they would be crucifying the Son of God over again for themselves, and exposing him to open contempt.
058	HEB	006	007	Ground that drinks in the showers that from time to time fall on it, and produces vegetation useful to those for whom it is tilled, receives a blessing from God;
058	HEB	006	008	but, if it bears thorns and thistles, it is regarded as worthless, it is in danger of being cursed, and its end will be the fire.
058	HEB	006	009	But about you, dear friends, even though we speak in this way, we are confident of better things – of things that point to your salvation.
058	HEB	006	010	For God is not unjust; he will not forget the work that you did, and the love that you showed for his name, in sending help to your fellow Christians – as you are still doing.
058	HEB	006	011	But our great desire is that every one of you should be equally earnest to attain to a full conviction that our hope will be fulfilled, and that you should keep that hope to the end.
058	HEB	006	012	Then you will not show yourselves slow to learn, but you will copy those who, through faith and patience, are now entering upon the enjoyment of God’s promises.
058	HEB	006	013	When God gave his promise to Abraham, since there was no one greater by whom he could swear, he swore by himself.
058	HEB	006	014	His words were – “I will assuredly bless you and increase your numbers.”
058	HEB	006	015	And so, after patiently waiting, Abraham obtained the fulfilment of God’s promise.
058	HEB	006	016	People, of course, swear by what is greater than themselves, and with them an oath is accepted as putting a matter beyond all dispute.
058	HEB	006	017	And therefore God, in his desire to show, with unmistakable plainness, to those who were to enter on the enjoyment of what he had promised, the unchangeableness of his purpose, bound himself with an oath.
058	HEB	006	018	For he intended us to find great encouragement in these two unchangeable things, which make it impossible for God to prove false – we, I mean, who fled for safety where we might lay hold on the hope set before us.
058	HEB	006	019	This hope is an anchor for our souls, secure and strong, and it reaches into the sanctuary that lies behind the curtain,
058	HEB	006	020	where Jesus, our forerunner, has entered on our behalf, after being made for all time a high priest of the order of Melchizedek.
058	HEB	007	001	It was this Melchizedek, king of Salem and priest of the Most High God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and gave him his blessing;
058	HEB	007	002	and it was to him that Abraham allotted a tithe of all the spoil. The meaning of his name is “king of righteousness,” and besides that, he was also king of Salem, which means “king of peace.”
058	HEB	007	003	There is no record of his father, or mother, or lineage, nor again of any beginning of his days, or end of his life. In this he resembles the Son of God, and stands before us as a priest whose priesthood is continuous.
058	HEB	007	004	Consider, then the importance of this Melchizedek, to whom even the patriarch Abraham himself gave a tithe of the choicest spoils.
058	HEB	007	005	Those descendants of Levi, who are from time to time appointed to the priesthood, are directed to collect tithes from the people in accordance with the Law – that is from their own kindred, although they also are descended from Abraham.
058	HEB	007	006	But Melchizedek, although not of this lineage, received tithes from Abraham, and gave his blessing to the man who had God’s promises.
058	HEB	007	007	Now no one can dispute that it is the superior who blesses the inferior.
058	HEB	007	008	In the one case the tithes are received by people who are mortal; in the other case by one about whom there is the statement that his life still continues.
058	HEB	007	009	Moreover, in a sense, even Levi, who is the receiver of the tithes, has, through Abraham, paid tithes;
058	HEB	007	010	for Levi was still in the body of his ancestor when Melchizedek met Abraham.
058	HEB	007	011	If, then, perfection had been attainable through the Levitical priesthood – and it was under this priesthood that the people received the Law – why was it still necessary that a priest of a different order should appear, a priest of the order of Melchizedek and not of the order of Aaron?
058	HEB	007	012	With the change of the priesthood a change of the Law became a necessity.
058	HEB	007	013	And he of whom all this is said belonged to quite a different tribe, no member of which has ever served at the altar.
058	HEB	007	014	For it is plain that our Lord had sprung from the tribe of Judah, though of that tribe Moses said nothing about their being priests.
058	HEB	007	015	All this becomes even yet plainer when we remember that a new priest has appeared, resembling Melchizedek,
058	HEB	007	016	and that he was appointed, not under a Law regulating only earthly matters, but by virtue of a life beyond the reach of death;
058	HEB	007	017	for that is the meaning of the declaration – “You are for all time a priest of the order of Melchizedek.”
058	HEB	007	018	On the one hand, we have the abolition of a previous regulation as being both inefficient and useless
058	HEB	007	019	(for the Law never brought anything to perfection); and, on the other hand, we have the introduction of a better hope, which enables us to draw near to God.
058	HEB	007	020	Then again, the appointment of this new priest was ratified by an oath, which is not so with the Levitical priests,
058	HEB	007	021	but his appointment was ratified by an oath, when God said to him – “The Lord has sworn, and will not change, ‘You are a priest for all time.’”
058	HEB	007	022	And the oath shows the corresponding superiority of the covenant of which Jesus is appointed the surety.
058	HEB	007	023	Again, new Levitical priests are continually being appointed, because death prevents their remaining in office;
058	HEB	007	024	but Jesus remains for all time, and therefore the priesthood that he holds will never pass to another.
058	HEB	007	025	And that is why he is able to save perfectly those who come to God through him, living for ever, as he does, to intercede of their behalf.
058	HEB	007	026	This was the high priest that we needed – holy, innocent, spotless, withdrawn from sinners, exalted above the highest heaven,
058	HEB	007	027	one who has no need to offer sacrifices daily as those high priests have, first for their own sins, and then for those of the people. For this he did once and for all, when he offered himself as the sacrifice.
058	HEB	007	028	The Law appoints as high priests men who are weak, but the words of God’s oath, which was later than the Law, name the Son as, for all time, the perfect priest.
058	HEB	008	001	To sum up what I have been saying: Such is the high priest that we have, one who has taken his seat at the right hand of the throne of God’s Majesty in heaven,
058	HEB	008	002	where he serves in the sanctuary, in that true tent set up by the Lord and not by man.
058	HEB	008	003	Every high priest is appointed for the purpose of offering gifts and sacrifices to God; it follows, therefore, that this high priest must have some offering to make.
058	HEB	008	004	If he were, however, still on earth, he would not even be a priest, since there are already priests who offer the gifts as the Law directs.
058	HEB	008	005	(These priests, it is true, are engaged in a service which is only a copy and shadow of the heavenly realities, as is shown by the directions given to Moses when he was about to construct the tent. “Look to it,” are the words, “that you make every part in accordance with the pattern shown you on the mountain.”)
058	HEB	008	006	But Jesus, as we see, has obtained a ministry as far excelling theirs, as the covenant of which he is the intermediary, based, as it is, on better promises, excels the former covenant.
058	HEB	008	007	If that first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no occasion for a second.
058	HEB	008	008	But, finding fault with the people, God says – “‘A time is coming,’ says the Lord, ‘When I will ratify a new covenant with the people of Israel and with the people of Judah –
058	HEB	008	009	Not such a covenant as I made with their ancestors on the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt. For they did not abide by their covenant with me, and therefore I disregarded them,’ says the Lord.
058	HEB	008	010	‘This is the covenant that I will make with the people of Israel after those days,’ says the Lord. ‘I will impress my laws on their minds, and will inscribe them on their hearts; and I will be their God, and they will be my people.
058	HEB	008	011	There will be no need for anyone to instruct their fellow citizen, or for a person to say to their relatives “Learn to know the Lord”; for everyone will know me, from the lowest to the highest.
058	HEB	008	012	For I will be merciful to their wrongdoings, and I will no longer remember their sins.’”
058	HEB	008	013	By speaking of a new covenant, God at once renders the former covenant obsolete; and whatever becomes obsolete and loses its force is virtually annulled.
058	HEB	009	001	It is true that even the first covenant had its regulations for divine worship, and its sanctuary – though only a material one.
058	HEB	009	002	For a tent was constructed, with an outer part which contained the stand for the lamps, and the table, and the consecrated bread. This is called the sanctuary.
058	HEB	009	003	The part of the tent behind the second curtain is called the inner sanctuary.
058	HEB	009	004	In it is the gold incense-altar, and the ark containing the covenant, completely covered with gold. In the ark is a gold casket containing the manna, Aaron’s rod that budded, and the tablets on which the covenant was written;
058	HEB	009	005	while above it, and overshadowing the cover on which atonement was made, are the cherubim of the presence. Now is not the time to discuss these things in detail.
058	HEB	009	006	Such, then, was the arrangement of the tent. Into the outer part priests are constantly going, in the discharge of their sacred duties;
058	HEB	009	007	but into the inner only the high priest goes, and that but once a year, and never without taking the blood of a victim, which he offers on his own behalf, and on behalf of the errors of the people.
058	HEB	009	008	By this the Holy Spirit is teaching that the way into the sanctuary was hidden, as long as the outer part of the tent still remained.
058	HEB	009	009	For that was only a type, to continue down to the present time; and, in keeping with it, both gifts and sacrifices are offered, though incapable of satisfying the conscience of the worshiper;
058	HEB	009	010	the whole system being concerned only with food and drink and various ablutions – external ceremonials imposed until the coming of the new order.
058	HEB	009	011	But, when Christ came, he appeared as high priest of that better system which was established; and he entered through that nobler and more perfect tent, not made by human hands – that is to say, not a part of this present creation.
058	HEB	009	012	Nor was it with the blood of goats and calves, but with his own blood, that he entered, once and for all, into the sanctuary, and obtained our eternal deliverance.
058	HEB	009	013	For, if the blood of goats and bulls, and the sprinkling of the ashes of a heifer, purify those who have been defiled (as far as ceremonial purification goes),
058	HEB	009	014	how much more will the blood of the Christ, who, through his eternal Spirit, offered himself up to God, as a victim without blemish, purify our consciences from a lifeless formality, and fit us for the service of the living God!
058	HEB	009	015	And that is why he is the intermediary of a new covenant; in order that, as a death has taken place to effect a deliverance from the offences committed under the first covenant, those who have received the call may obtain the eternal inheritance promised to them.
058	HEB	009	016	Whenever such a covenant as a will is in question, the death of the testator must of necessity be alleged.
058	HEB	009	017	For such a covenant takes effect only on death, it does not come into force as long as the testator is alive.
058	HEB	009	018	This explains why even the first covenant was not ratified without the shedding of blood.
058	HEB	009	019	For, when every command had been announced to all the people by Moses in accordance with the Law, he took the blood of the calves and of the goats, with water, scarlet wool, and a bunch of hyssop, and sprinkled even the book of the Law, as well as all the people,
058	HEB	009	020	saying, as he did so – ‘This is the blood that renders valid the covenant which God has commanded to be made with you.’
058	HEB	009	021	And in the same way he also sprinkled with the blood the tent and all the things that were used in public worship.
058	HEB	009	022	Indeed, under the Law, almost everything is purified with blood; and, unless blood is shed, no forgiveness is to be obtained.
058	HEB	009	023	While, then, it was necessary for the copies of the heavenly realities to be purified by such means as these, the heavenly realities themselves required better sacrifices.
058	HEB	009	024	For it was not into a sanctuary made by human hands, which merely foreshadowed the true one, that Christ entered, but into heaven itself, so that he might now appear in the presence of God on our behalf.
058	HEB	009	025	Nor yet was it to offer himself may times, as year after year the high priest entered the sanctuary with an offering of blood – but not his own blood;
058	HEB	009	026	for then Christ would have had to undergo death many times since the creation of the world. But now, once and for all, at the close of the age, he has appeared, in order to abolish sin by the sacrifice of himself.
058	HEB	009	027	And, as it is ordained for people to die but once (death being followed by judgment),
058	HEB	009	028	so it is with the Christ. He was offered up once and for all, to bear away the sins of many; and the second time he will appear – but without any burden of sin – to those who are waiting for him, to bring salvation.
058	HEB	010	001	The Law, though able to foreshadow the better system which was coming, never had its actual substance. Its priests, with those sacrifices which they offer continuously year after year, can never make those who come to worship perfect.
058	HEB	010	002	Otherwise, would not the offering of these sacrifices have been abandoned, as the worshipers, having been once purified, would have had their consciences clear from sins?
058	HEB	010	003	But, on the contrary, these sacrifices recall their sins to mind year after year.
058	HEB	010	004	For the blood of bulls and goats is powerless to remove sins.
058	HEB	010	005	That is why, when he was coming into the world, the Christ declared – “Sacrifice and offering you do not desire, but you provide for me a body;
058	HEB	010	006	You take no pleasure in burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin.
058	HEB	010	007	So I said, ‘See, I have come’ (as is written of me in the pages of the book), ‘To do your will, God.’”
058	HEB	010	008	First come the words – “You do not desire, nor do you take pleasure in, sacrifices, offerings, burnt offerings, and sacrifices for sin” (offerings regularly made under the Law),
058	HEB	010	009	and then there is added – “See, I have come to do your will.” The former sacrifices are set aside to be replaced by the latter.
058	HEB	010	010	And it is in the fulfilment of the will of God that we have been purified by the sacrifice, once and for all, of the body of Jesus Christ.
058	HEB	010	011	Every other priest stands day after day at his ministrations, and offers the same sacrifices over and over again – sacrifices that can never take sins away.
058	HEB	010	012	But, this priest, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins, which should serve for all time, “took his seat at the right hand of God,”
058	HEB	010	013	and has since then been waiting “for his enemies to be put as a stool for his feet.”
058	HEB	010	014	By a single offering he has made perfect for all time those who are being purified.
058	HEB	010	015	We have also the testimony of the Holy Spirit. For, after saying –
058	HEB	010	016	“‘This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days,’ says the Lord; ‘I will impress my laws on their hearts, and will inscribe them on their minds,’”
058	HEB	010	017	then we have – “And their sins and their iniquities I will no longer remember.”
058	HEB	010	018	And, when these are forgiven, there is no further need of an offering for sin.
058	HEB	010	019	Therefore, friends, since we may enter the sanctuary with confidence, in virtue of the blood of Jesus,
058	HEB	010	020	by the way which he inaugurated for us – a new and living way, a way through the sanctuary curtain (that is, his human nature);
058	HEB	010	021	and, since we have in him “a great priest set over the house of God,”
058	HEB	010	022	let us draw near to God in all sincerity of heart and in perfect faith, with our hearts purified by the sprinkled blood from all consciousness of wrong, and with our bodies washed with pure water.
058	HEB	010	023	Let us maintain the confession of our hope unshaken, for he who has given us his promise will not fail us.
058	HEB	010	024	Let us vie with one another in a rivalry of love and noble actions.
058	HEB	010	025	And let us not, as some do, cease to meet together; but, on the contrary, let us encourage one another, and all the more, now that you see the day drawing near.
058	HEB	010	026	Remember, if we sin wilfully after we have gained a full knowledge of the truth, there can be no further sacrifice for sin;
058	HEB	010	027	there is only a fearful anticipation of judgment, and a burning indignation which will destroy all opponents.
058	HEB	010	028	When someone disregarded the Law of Moses, they were, on the evidence of two or three witnesses, put to death without pity.
058	HEB	010	029	How much worse then, think you, will be the punishment deserved by those who have trampled underfoot the Son of God, who have treated the blood that rendered the covenant valid – the blood by which they were purified – as if it were not holy, and who have outraged the Spirit of love?
058	HEB	010	030	We know who it was that said – “It is for me to avenge, I will requite”; and again – “The Lord will judge his people.”
058	HEB	010	031	It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
058	HEB	010	032	Call to mind those early days in which, after you had received the light, you patiently underwent a long and painful conflict.
058	HEB	010	033	Sometimes, in consequence of the taunts and injuries heaped on you, you became a public spectacle; and sometimes you suffered through having shown yourselves to be the friends of people who were in the same position in which you had been.
058	HEB	010	034	For you not only sympathised with those who were in prison, but you even took the confiscation of your possessions joyfully, knowing, as you did, that you had in yourselves a greater possession and a lasting one.
058	HEB	010	035	Do not, therefore, abandon the confidence that you have gained, for it has a great reward awaiting it.
058	HEB	010	036	You still have need of patient endurance, in order that, when you have done God’s will, you may obtain the fulfilment of his promise.
058	HEB	010	037	“For there is indeed but a very little while before he who is coming will have come, without delay;
058	HEB	010	038	and through faith the righteous will find life, but, if anyone draws back, my heart can find no pleasure in them.”
058	HEB	010	039	But we do not belong to those who draw back, to their ruin, but to those who have faith, to the saving of their souls.
058	HEB	011	001	Faith is the realisation of things hoped for – the proof of things not seen.
058	HEB	011	002	And it was for faith that the people of old were renowned.
058	HEB	011	003	Faith enables us to perceive that the universe was created at the bidding of God – so that we know that what we see was not made out of visible things.
058	HEB	011	004	Faith made the sacrifice which Abel offered to God a better sacrifice than Cain’s, and won him renown as a righteous man, God himself establishing his renown by accepting his gifts; and it is by the example of his faith that Abel, though dead, still speaks.
058	HEB	011	005	Faith led to Enoch’s removal from earth, so that he might not experience death. “He could not be found because God had removed him.” For, before his removal, he was renowned as having pleased God;
058	HEB	011	006	but without faith it is impossible to please him, for he who comes to God must believe that God exists, and that he rewards those who seek for him.
058	HEB	011	007	It was faith that enabled Noah, after he had received the divine warning about what could not then be foreseen, to build, in reverent obedience, an ark in which to save his family. By his faith he condemned the world, and became possessed of that righteousness which follows on faith.
058	HEB	011	008	It was faith that enabled Abraham to obey the call that he received, and to set out for the place which he was afterwards to obtain as his own; and he set out not knowing where he was going.
058	HEB	011	009	It was faith that made him go to live as an emigrant in the promised land – as in a strange country – living there in tents with Isaac and Jacob, who shared the promise with him.
058	HEB	011	010	For he was looking for the city with the sure foundations, whose architect and builder is God.
058	HEB	011	011	Again, it was faith that enabled Sarah to conceive (though she was past the age for childbearing), because she felt sure that he who had given her the promise would not fail her.
058	HEB	011	012	And so from one man – and that when his powers were dead – there sprang a people as numerous “as the stars in the heavens or the countless grains of sand on the shore.”
058	HEB	011	013	All these died sustained by faith. They did not obtain the promised blessings, but they saw them from a distance and welcomed the sight, and they acknowledged themselves to be only foreigners and strangers on the earth.
058	HEB	011	014	Those who speak like this show plainly that they are seeking their homeland.
058	HEB	011	015	If they had been thinking of the land that they had left, they could have found opportunities to return.
058	HEB	011	016	But no, they were longing for a better, a heavenly, land! And therefore God was not ashamed to be called their God; indeed he had already prepared them a city.
058	HEB	011	017	It was faith that enabled Abraham, when put to the test, to offer Isaac as a sacrifice – he who had received the promises offering up his only son,
058	HEB	011	018	of whom it had been said – “It is through Isaac that there will be descendants to bear your name.”
058	HEB	011	019	For he argued that God was even able to raise a man from the dead – and indeed, figuratively speaking, Abraham did receive Isaac back from the dead.
058	HEB	011	020	It was faith that enabled Isaac to bless Jacob and Esau, even with regard to the future.
058	HEB	011	021	Faith enabled Jacob, when dying, to give his blessing to each of the sons of Joseph, and “to bow himself in worship as he leant on the top of his staff.”
058	HEB	011	022	Faith caused Joseph, when his end was near, to speak of the future migration of the Israelites, and to give instructions with regard to his bones.
058	HEB	011	023	Faith caused the parents of Moses to hide the child for three months after his birth, for they saw that he was a beautiful child; and they would not respect the king’s order.
058	HEB	011	024	It was faith that caused Moses, when he was grown up, to refuse the title of “son of a daughter of Pharaoh.”
058	HEB	011	025	He preferred sharing the hardships of God’s people to enjoying the short-lived pleasures of sin.
058	HEB	011	026	For he counted “the reproaches that are heaped on the Christ” of greater value than the treasures of Egypt, looking forward, as he did, to the reward awaiting him.
058	HEB	011	027	Faith caused him to leave Egypt, though undaunted by the king’s anger, for he was strengthened in his endurance by the vision of the invisible God.
058	HEB	011	028	Faith led him to institute the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood, so that the Destroyer might not touch the eldest children of the Israelites.
058	HEB	011	029	Faith enabled the people to cross the Red Sea, as if it had been dry land, while the Egyptians, when they attempted to do so, were drowned.
058	HEB	011	030	Faith caused the walls of Jericho to fall after being encircled for seven days.
058	HEB	011	031	Faith saved Rahab, the prostitute, from perishing with the unbelievers, after she had entertained the spies with friendliness.
058	HEB	011	032	Need I add anything more? Time would fail me if I attempted to relate the stories of Gideon, Barak, Samson, and Jephthah, and those of David, Samuel, and the prophets.
058	HEB	011	033	By their faith they subdued kingdoms, ruled righteously, gained the fulfilment of God’s promises, shut the mouths of lions,
058	HEB	011	034	quelled the fury of the flames, escaped the edge of the sword, found strength in the hour of weakness, displayed their prowess in war, and routed hostile armies.
058	HEB	011	035	Women received back their dead raised to life. Some were tortured on the wheel, and refused release in order that they might rise to a better life.
058	HEB	011	036	Others had to face taunts and blows, and even chains and imprisonment.
058	HEB	011	037	They were stoned to death, they were tortured, they were swan asunder, they were put to the sword; they wandered about clothed in the skins of sheep or goats, destitute, persecuted, ill-used –
058	HEB	011	038	people of whom the world was not worthy – roaming in lonely places, and on the mountains, and in caves and holes in the ground.
058	HEB	011	039	Yet, though they all won renown by their faith, they did not obtain the final fulfilment of God’s promise;
058	HEB	011	040	since God had in view some better thing for us, so that they would only reach perfection together with us.
058	HEB	012	001	Seeing, therefore, that there is on every side of us such a throng of witnesses, let us also lay aside everything that hinders us, and the sin that clings about us, and run with patient endurance the race that lies before us,
058	HEB	012	002	our eyes fixed on Jesus, the leader and perfect example of our faith, who, for the joy that lay before him, endured the cross, heedless of its shame, and now “has taken his seat at the right hand” of the throne of God.
058	HEB	012	003	Weigh well the example of him who had to endure such opposition from “people who were sinning against themselves,” so that you should not grow weary or faint-hearted.
058	HEB	012	004	You have not yet, in your struggle with sin, resisted to the death;
058	HEB	012	005	and you have forgotten the encouraging words which are addressed to you as God’s children – “My child, think not lightly of the Lord’s discipline, do not despond when he rebukes you;
058	HEB	012	006	For it is him whom he loves that he disciplines, and he chastises every child whom he acknowledges.”
058	HEB	012	007	It is for your discipline that you have to endure all this. God is dealing with you as his children. For where is there a child whom his father does not discipline?
058	HEB	012	008	If you are left without that discipline, in which all children share, it shows that you are bastards, and not true children.
058	HEB	012	009	Further, when our earthly fathers disciplined us, we respected them. Should we not, then, much rather yield submission to the Father of souls, and live?
058	HEB	012	010	Our fathers disciplined us for only a short time and as seemed best to them; but God disciplines us for our true good, to enable us to share his holiness.
058	HEB	012	011	No discipline is pleasant at the time; on the contrary, it is painful. But afterwards its fruit is seen in the peacefulness of a righteous life which is the lot of those who have been trained under it.
058	HEB	012	012	Therefore “lift again the down-dropped hands and straighten the weakened knees;
058	HEB	012	013	make straight paths for your feet,” so that the lame limb may not be put out of joint, but rather be cured.
058	HEB	012	014	Try earnestly to live at peace with everyone, and to attain to that purity without which no one will see the Lord.
058	HEB	012	015	Take care that no one fails to use the loving help of God, “that no bitterness is allowed to take root and spring up, and cause trouble,” and so poison the whole community.
058	HEB	012	016	Take care that no one becomes immoral, or irreligious like Esau, who sold his birthright for a single meal.
058	HEB	012	017	For you know that even afterwards, when he wished to claim his father’s blessing, he was rejected – for he never found an opportunity to repair his error – though he begged for the blessing with tears.
058	HEB	012	018	It is not to tangible “flaming fire” that you have drawn near, nor to “gloom, and darkness, and storm,
058	HEB	012	019	and the blast of a trumpet, and an audible voice.” Those who heard that voice entreated that they might hear no more,
058	HEB	012	020	for they could not bear to think of the command – “If even an animal touches the mountain, it is to be stoned to death;”
058	HEB	012	021	and so fearful was the sight that Moses said – “I tremble with fear.”
058	HEB	012	022	No, but it is to Mount Zion that you have drawn near, the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, to countless hosts of angels,
058	HEB	012	023	to the festal gathering and assemblage of God’s firstborn whose names are enrolled in heaven, to God the judge of all people, to the spirits of the righteous who have attained perfection,
058	HEB	012	024	to Jesus, the intermediary of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that tells of better things than the blood of Abel.
058	HEB	012	025	Beware how you refuse to hear him who is speaking. For, if the Israelites did not escape punishment, when they refused to listen to him who taught them on earth the divine will, far worse will it be for us, if we turn away from him who is teaching us from heaven.
058	HEB	012	026	Then his voice shook the earth, but now his declaration is – “Still once more I will cause not only the earth to tremble, but also the heavens.”
058	HEB	012	027	And those words “still once more” indicate the passing away of all that is shaken – that is, of all created things – in order that only what is unshaken may remain.
058	HEB	012	028	Therefore, let us, who have received a kingdom that cannot be shaken, be thankful, and so offer acceptable worship to God, with awe and the deepest respect.
058	HEB	012	029	For our God is “a consuming fire.”
058	HEB	013	001	Let your love for the Lord’s followers continue.
058	HEB	013	002	Do not neglect to show hospitality; for, through being hospitable, people have all unawares entertained angels.
058	HEB	013	003	Remember the prisoners, as if you were their fellow prisoners, and the oppressed, not forgetting that you also are still in the body.
058	HEB	013	004	Let marriage be honoured by all and the married life be pure; for God will judge those who are immoral and those who commit adultery.
058	HEB	013	005	Do not let your conduct be ruled by the love of money. Be content with what you have, for God himself has said – “I will never forsake you, nor will I ever abandon you.”
058	HEB	013	006	Therefore we may say with confidence – “The Lord is my helper, I will not be afraid. What can mere people do to me?”
058	HEB	013	007	Do not forget your leaders, who told you God’s message. Recall the close of their lives, and imitate their faith.
058	HEB	013	008	Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today – yes, and for ever!
058	HEB	013	009	Do not let yourselves be carried away by the various novel forms of teaching. It is better to rely for spiritual strength on the divine help, than on regulations regarding food; for those whose lives are guided by such regulations have not found them of service.
058	HEB	013	010	We are not without an altar; but it is one at which those who still worship in the tent have no right to eat.
058	HEB	013	011	The bodies of those animals whose blood is brought by the high priest into the sanctuary, as an offering for sin, are burnt outside the camp.
058	HEB	013	012	And so Jesus, also, to purify the people by his own blood, suffered outside the gate.
058	HEB	013	013	Therefore let us go out to him “outside the camp,” bearing the same reproaches as he;
058	HEB	013	014	for here we have no permanent city, but are looking for the city that is to be.
058	HEB	013	015	Through him let us offer, as our sacrifice, continual praise to God – an offering from lips that glorify his name.
058	HEB	013	016	Never forget to do kindly acts and to share what you have with others, for such sacrifices are acceptable to God.
058	HEB	013	017	Obey your leaders, and submit to their control, for they are watching over your souls, since they will have to render an account, so that they may do it with joy, and not in sorrow. That would not be to your advantage.
058	HEB	013	018	Pray for us, for we are sure that our consciences are clear, since our wish is to be occupied with what is good.
058	HEB	013	019	And I the more earnestly ask for your prayers, so that I may be restored to you the sooner.
058	HEB	013	020	May God, the source of all peace, who brought back from the dead him who, “by virtue of the blood that rendered valid the unchangeable covenant, is the great shepherd of God’s Sheep,” Jesus, our Lord –
058	HEB	013	021	may God make you perfect in everything that is good, so that you may be able to do his will. May he bring out in us all that is pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be all glory for ever and ever. Amen.
058	HEB	013	022	I beg you, friends, to bear with these words of advice. For I have written only very briefly to you.
058	HEB	013	023	You will be glad to hear that our friend, Timothy, has been set free. If he comes here soon, we will visit you together.
058	HEB	013	024	Give our greeting to all your leaders, and to all Christ’s people. Our friends from Italy send their greetings to you.
058	HEB	013	025	May God bless you all.

# BOOK	059	JAM	James	James
059	JAM	001	001	James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, greets the twelve tribes that are living abroad.
059	JAM	001	002	My friends, whatever trials you may face from time to time, always regard them as a reason for rejoicing,
059	JAM	001	003	knowing, as you do, that the testing of your faith develops endurance.
059	JAM	001	004	And let endurance do its work perfectly, so that you may be altogether perfect, and in no respect lacking.
059	JAM	001	005	If any one of you lacks wisdom, they should ask wisdom from the God who gives freely to everyone without reproach, and it will be given to them.
059	JAM	001	006	But they should ask with confidence, never doubting; for the person who doubts is like a wave of the sea driven here and there at the mercy of the wind –
059	JAM	001	007	Such a person must not expect that they will receive anything from the Lord,
059	JAM	001	008	vacillating as they are, irresolute at every turn.
059	JAM	001	009	Let a follower in humble circumstances be proud of their exalted position,
059	JAM	001	010	but a rich follower of their humiliation; for the rich will pass away like a wild flower.
059	JAM	001	011	As the sun rises, and the hot wind blows, the plant withers, its flower fades, and all its beauty is gone. So is it with the rich. In the midst of their pursuits they will wither away.
059	JAM	001	012	Blessed is the person who remains firm under temptation, for, when they have stood the test, they will receive the crown of life, which the Lord has promised to those who love him.
059	JAM	001	013	Let no one say, when they are tempted, ‘It is God who is tempting me!’ For God, who cannot be tempted to do wrong, does not himself tempt anyone.
059	JAM	001	014	A man is in every case tempted by their own passions – allured and enticed by them.
059	JAM	001	015	Then passion conceives and gives birth to sin, and sin, on reaching maturity, brings forth death.
059	JAM	001	016	Do not be deceived, my dear friends.
059	JAM	001	017	Every good thing given us, and every perfect gift, is from above, and comes down to us from the Father of the lights in the heavens, who is himself never subject to change or to eclipse.
059	JAM	001	018	Because he so willed, he gave us life, through the message of the truth, so that we should be, as it were, a kind of first fruits of his creation.
059	JAM	001	019	Mark this, my dear friends – Let everyone be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to get angry;
059	JAM	001	020	for human anger does not forward the righteous purpose of God.
059	JAM	001	021	Therefore, get rid of all filthiness and whatever wickedness still remains, and in a humble spirit receive that message which has been planted in your hearts and is able to save your souls.
059	JAM	001	022	Put that message into practice, and do not merely listen to it – deceiving yourselves.
059	JAM	001	023	For, when anyone listens to it and does not practice it, they are like a person looking at their own face in a mirror.
059	JAM	001	024	They look at themselves, then go on their way,
059	JAM	001	025	but the person who looks carefully into the perfect Law, the Law of freedom, and continues to do so, not listening to it and then forgetting it, but putting it into practice – that person will be blessed in what they do.
059	JAM	001	026	When a person appears to be religious, yet does not bridle their tongue, but imposes on their own conscience, that person’s religious observances are valueless.
059	JAM	001	027	That religious observance which is pure and spotless in the eyes of God our Father is this – to visit orphans and widows in their trouble, and to keep oneself uncontaminated by the world.
059	JAM	002	001	My friends, are you really trying to combine faith in Jesus Christ, our glorified Lord, with discrimination?
059	JAM	002	002	Suppose a visitor should enter your synagogue, with gold rings and in grand clothes, and suppose a poor man should come in also, in shabby clothes,
059	JAM	002	003	and you show more respect to the visitor who is wearing grand clothes, and say – ‘There is a good seat for you here,’ but to the poor man – ‘You must stand; or sit down there by my footstool,’
059	JAM	002	004	Haven’t you made distinctions among yourselves, and used evil standards of judgement?
059	JAM	002	005	Listen, my dear friends. Has not God chosen those who are poor in the things of this world to be rich through their faith, and to possess the kingdom which he has promised to those who love him?
059	JAM	002	006	But you – you insult the poor man! Isn’t it the rich who oppress you? Isn’t it they who drag you into law courts?
059	JAM	002	007	Isn’t it they who malign that honourable name spoken over you at your baptism?
059	JAM	002	008	If you keep the royal law which runs – “You must love your neighbour as you love yourself,” you are doing right;
059	JAM	002	009	but, if you discriminate, you commit a sin, and stand convicted by that same law of being offenders against it.
059	JAM	002	010	For a person who has laid the Law, as a whole, to heart, but has failed in one particular, is accountable for breaking all its provisions.
059	JAM	002	011	He who said “You must not commit adultery” also said “You must not murder.” If, then, you commit murder but not adultery, you are still an offender against the Law.
059	JAM	002	012	Therefore, speak and act as people who are to be judged by the “Law of freedom.”
059	JAM	002	013	For there will be justice without mercy for the person who has not acted mercifully. Mercy triumphs over Justice.
059	JAM	002	014	My friends, what good is it if someone claims that they have faith, but they do not prove it by actions? Can such faith save them?
059	JAM	002	015	Suppose some brother or sister should be in need of clothes and of daily bread,
059	JAM	002	016	and one of you says to them – ‘Go, and peace be with you; keep warm and eat well!’ and yet you do not actually give them the necessities of life, what good would it be to them?
059	JAM	002	017	In just the same way faith, if not followed by actions, is, by itself, a lifeless thing.
059	JAM	002	018	Someone, indeed, may say – ‘You are a man of faith, and I am a man of action.’ ‘Then show me your faith,’ I reply, ‘apart from any actions, and I will show you my faith by my actions.’
059	JAM	002	019	It is a part of your faith, is it not, that there is one God? Good; yet even the demons have that faith, and tremble at the thought.
059	JAM	002	020	Now do you really want to understand, fool, how it is that faith without actions leads to nothing?
059	JAM	002	021	Look at our ancestor, Abraham. Was he not justified by his actions after he had offered his son, Isaac, on the altar?
059	JAM	002	022	You see how, in his case, faith and actions went together; that his faith was perfected as the result of his actions;
059	JAM	002	023	and that in this way the words of scripture came true – ‘Abraham believed God, and that was regarded by God as righteousness,’ and ‘He was called the friend of God.’
059	JAM	002	024	You see, then, that a person is justified by actions, and not by faith alone.
059	JAM	002	025	Wasn’t it the same with the prostitute, Rahab? Was she not justified by her actions, after she had welcomed the messengers and helped them escape by another road?
059	JAM	002	026	Just as a body is dead without a spirit, so faith is dead without actions.
059	JAM	003	001	Not many of you should become teachers, my friends, because you know that we who teach will be judged more strictly than others.
059	JAM	003	002	We often make mistakes, every one of us. Anyone who does not make mistakes when speaking is indeed a perfect person, able to bridle their whole body as well.
059	JAM	003	003	When we put bits into horses’ mouths to make them obey us, we change their course the rest of their bodies.
059	JAM	003	004	Again, think of ships. Large as they are, and even when driven by fierce winds, they are guided by a very small rudder and steered in whatever direction the man at the helm may determine.
059	JAM	003	005	So is it with the tongue. Small as it is, it is a great boaster. Think how a tiny spark may set the largest forest ablaze!
059	JAM	003	006	And the tongue is like a spark. It is a world of unrighteousness among the parts of our body. It contaminates the whole body; it sets the whole course of our existence on fire, and is itself set on fire by the flames of Gehenna.
059	JAM	003	007	For while all kinds of animals, birds and reptiles and sea creatures can be tamed and have been tamed by humans,
059	JAM	003	008	no human being can tame the tongue. It is a restless plague! It is charged with deadly poison!
059	JAM	003	009	With it we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse people who are made “in God’s likeness.”
059	JAM	003	010	From the very same mouth come blessings and curses! My friends, it is not right that this should be so.
059	JAM	003	011	Does a spring give both good and bad water from the same source?
059	JAM	003	012	Can a fig tree, my friends, bear olives? Or a vine bear figs? No, nor can a brackish well give good water.
059	JAM	003	013	Who among you claims to be wise and intelligent? They should show that their actions are the outcome of a good life lived in the humility of true wisdom.
059	JAM	003	014	But if you harbour bitter envy and a spirit of rivalry in your hearts, do not boast or deny the truth.
059	JAM	003	015	That is not the wisdom which comes from above; no, it is earthly, animalistic, demonic.
059	JAM	003	016	For where envy and rivalry exist, there you will also find disorder and all kinds of bad, worthless actions.
059	JAM	003	017	But the wisdom from above is, before everything else, pure; then peace-loving, gentle, open to conviction, rich in compassion and good deeds, and free from partiality and insincerity.
059	JAM	003	018	Justice is the harvest peacemakers will reap from seeds sown in a spirit of peace.
059	JAM	004	001	What is the cause of the fighting and quarrelling that goes on among you? Isn’t it to be found in the desires which are always at war within you?
059	JAM	004	002	You crave, yet do not have, so you commit murder, so You covet, yet cannot gain your end. You quarrel and fight. You do not have, because you do not ask.
059	JAM	004	003	You ask, yet do not receive, because you ask for a wrong purpose – to spend what you get on your pleasures.
059	JAM	004	004	Unfaithful people! Don’t you know that to be friends with the world means to be at enmity with God? Therefore whoever chooses to be friends with the world makes himself an enemy to God.
059	JAM	004	005	Do you suppose scripture means nothing when it says, “Envy results from the longings of the spirit which God has implanted within you?”
059	JAM	004	006	But he gives us greater grace; and that is why it says, – “God opposes the haughty, but gives grace to the humble.”
059	JAM	004	007	Therefore submit to God. Stand up to the devil, and he will flee from you.
059	JAM	004	008	Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Make your hands clean, you sinners; and your hearts pure, you vacillators!
059	JAM	004	009	Grieve, mourn, and lament! Let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your happiness to gloom!
059	JAM	004	010	Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will exalt you.
059	JAM	004	011	Do not disparage one another, friends. The person who disparages others, or passes judgment on them, disparages the Law and passes judgment on the Law. But, if you pass judgment on the Law, you are not obeying it, but judging it.
059	JAM	004	012	There is only one lawgiver and judge – he who has the power both to save and to destroy. So then who are you to pass judgment on your neighbour?
059	JAM	004	013	Listen to me, you who say “Today or tomorrow we will go to such and such a town and spend a year there, doing business and making money,”
059	JAM	004	014	yet you do not know what your life will be like tomorrow! For you are but a puff of smoke that appears for a little while and then vanishes.
059	JAM	004	015	Instead you should say “If the Lord wills, we will live and do this or that.”
059	JAM	004	016	But as it is, you are boasting presumptuously! All such boasting is wicked.
059	JAM	004	017	The person, then, who knows what is right but fails to do it – that is sin in them.
059	JAM	005	001	Listen to me, you rich people, weep and wail for the miseries that are coming upon you!
059	JAM	005	002	Your riches have wasted away, and your clothes have become moth-eaten.
059	JAM	005	003	Your gold and silver are rusted; and the rust on them will be evidence against you, and will eat into your flesh. It was fire, so to speak, that you stored up for yourselves in these last days.
059	JAM	005	004	Listen! The wages you have held back from the labourers who mowed your fields are crying out against you, and the outcries of your harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord of Hosts!
059	JAM	005	005	You have lived on earth a life of extravagance and luxury; you have indulged your fancies in a time of bloodshed.
059	JAM	005	006	You have condemned, you have murdered, the righteous one! Must not God be opposed to you?
059	JAM	005	007	Be patient, then, friends, until the coming of the Lord. Even the farmer has to wait for the precious fruit of the earth, watching over it patiently, until it has had the spring and summer rains.
059	JAM	005	008	And you must be patient also, and not be discouraged; for the Lord’s coming is near.
059	JAM	005	009	Do not make complaints against one another, friends, or judgment will be passed on you. The judge is already standing at the door!
059	JAM	005	010	Friends, as an example of the patient endurance of suffering, take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord.
059	JAM	005	011	We count those who displayed such endurance blessed! You have heard, too, of Job’s endurance, and have seen what the Lord’s purpose was, for “the Lord is full of pity and compassion.”
059	JAM	005	012	Above all things, my friends, never take an oath, either by heaven, or by earth, or by anything else. Let your “Yes” suffice for yes, and “No” for no, so that you may escape condemnation.
059	JAM	005	013	If anyone of you is in trouble, they should pray; if anyone is happy, they should sing hymns.
059	JAM	005	014	If anyone of you is ill, they should send for the church elders, and let them pray over them, anointing them with oil in the name of the Lord.
059	JAM	005	015	The prayer offered in faith will save the person who is sick, and the Lord will raise them from their bed; and if they have committed sins, they will be forgiven.
059	JAM	005	016	Therefore, confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, so that you may be cured. Great is the power of a good person’s fervent prayer.
059	JAM	005	017	Elijah was only human like ourselves, but, when he prayed fervently that it might not rain, no rain fell on the land for three and a half years.
059	JAM	005	018	And, when he prayed again, the clouds brought rain, and the land bore crops.
059	JAM	005	019	My friends, should one of you be led astray from the truth, and someone bring them back again,
059	JAM	005	020	be sure that the person who brings a sinner back from their mistaken ways will save that person’s soul from death, and will cover a multitude of sins.

060	1PE	001	004	given us the new life of undying hope, that promises an inheritance, imperishable, stainless, unfading, which has been reserved for you in heaven –
060	1PE	001	005	for you who, through faith, are being guarded by the power of God, awaiting a salvation that is ready to be revealed in the last days.
060	1PE	001	006	At the thought of this you are full of exultation, though (if it has been necessary) you have suffered for the moment somewhat from various trials;
060	1PE	001	007	that the genuineness of your faith – a thing far more precious than gold, which is perishable, yet has to be tested by fire – may win praise and glory and honour at the appearing of Jesus Christ.
060	1PE	001	008	Though you have never seen him, yet you love him; though you do not even now see him, yet you believe in him, and exalt with a triumphant happiness too great for words,
060	1PE	001	009	as you receive the reward of your faith in the salvation of your souls!
060	1PE	001	010	It was this salvation that the prophets, who spoke long ago of the blessing intended for you, sought, and strove to comprehend;
060	1PE	001	011	as they strove to discern what that time could be, to which the Spirit of Christ within them was pointing, when foretelling the sufferings that Christ would have to endure, and the glories that would follow.
060	1PE	001	012	And it was revealed to them that it was not for themselves, but for you, that they were acting as Ministers of the truths which have now been told to you, by those who, with the help of the Holy Spirit sent from heaven, have brought you the good news – truths into which even angels long to look.
060	1PE	001	013	Therefore concentrate your minds, with the strictest self-control, and fix your hopes on the blessing that is coming for you at the appearing of Jesus Christ.
060	1PE	001	014	Be like obedient children; do not let your lives be shaped by the passions which once swayed you in the days of your ignorance,
060	1PE	001	015	but in your whole life show yourselves to be holy, after the pattern of the Holy One from whom you received your call.
060	1PE	001	016	For scripture says – “You will be holy, because I am holy.”
060	1PE	001	017	And since you call on him as “Father,” who judges everyone impartially by what he has done, let respectful awe be the spirit of your lives during the time of your stay on earth.
060	1PE	001	018	For you know that it was not by perishable things, such as silver and gold, that you were ransomed from the aimless way of living which was handed down to you from your ancestors,
060	1PE	001	019	but by precious blood, as it were of a lamb, unblemished and spotless, the blood of Christ.
060	1PE	001	020	Destined for this before the beginning of the world, he has been revealed in these last days for your sakes,
060	1PE	001	021	who, through him, are faithful to God who raised him from the dead and gave him honour, so that your faith and hope are now in God.
060	1PE	001	022	Now that, by your obedience to the truth, you have purified your lives, so that there is growing up among you a genuine affection, love one another earnestly with all your hearts;
060	1PE	001	023	since your new life has come, not from perishable, but imperishable, seed, through the message of the Everliving God.
060	1PE	001	024	For – “All earthly life is but as grass, and all its splendour as the flower of grass. The grass fades, its flower falls,
060	1PE	001	025	but the teaching of the Lord remains for ever.” And that is the teaching of the good news which has been told to you.
060	1PE	002	001	Now that you have done with all malice, all deceitfulness, insincerity, jealous feelings, and all backbiting,
060	1PE	002	002	like newly born infants, crave pure spiritual milk, so that you may be enabled by it to grow until you attain salvation –
060	1PE	002	003	since “you have found by experience that the Lord is kind.”
060	1PE	002	004	Come to him, then, as to a living stone, rejected, indeed, by men, but in God’s eyes choice and precious;
060	1PE	002	005	and, as living stones, form yourselves into a spiritual house, to be a consecrated priesthood, for the offering of spiritual sacrifices that will be acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
060	1PE	002	006	For there is a passage of scripture that runs – “See, I am placing in Zion a choice and precious cornerstone; and those who believe in him will have no cause for shame.”
060	1PE	002	007	It is to you, then, who believe in him that he is precious, but to those who do not believe he is “a stone which, though rejected by the builders, has now itself become the corner-stone,”
060	1PE	002	008	and “a stumbling-block, and a rock which will prove a hindrance.” They stumble because they do not accept the message. This was the fate destined for them.
060	1PE	002	009	But you are “a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a consecrated nation, God’s own people,” entrusted with the proclamation of the goodness of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light.
060	1PE	002	010	Once you were “not a people,” but now you are “God’s people”; once you “had not found mercy,” but now you “have found mercy.”
060	1PE	002	011	Dear friends, I beg you, as pilgrims and strangers on earth, to refrain from indulging the cravings of your earthly nature, for they make war on the soul.
060	1PE	002	012	Let your daily life among the Gentiles be so upright, that, whenever they malign you as evildoers, they may learn, as they watch, from the uprightness of your conduct, to praise God “at the time when he will visit them.”
060	1PE	002	013	Submit to all human institutions for the Lord’s sake, alike to the emperor as the supreme authority,
060	1PE	002	014	and to governors as sent by him to punish evildoers and to commend those who do right.
060	1PE	002	015	For God’s will is this – that you should silence the ignorance of foolish people by doing what is right.
060	1PE	002	016	Act as free people, yet not using your freedom as those do who make it a cloak for wickedness, but as Servants of God.
060	1PE	002	017	Show honour to everyone, love the Lord’s followers, “revere God, honour the emperor.”
060	1PE	002	018	Those of you who are domestic servants should always be submissive and respectful to their masters, not only to those who are good and considerate, but also to those who are arbitrary.
060	1PE	002	019	For this wins God’s approval when, because conscious of God’s presence, a person who is suffering unjustly bears their troubles patiently.
060	1PE	002	020	What credit can you claim when, after doing wrong, you take your punishment for it patiently? But, on the other hand, if, after doing right, you take your sufferings patiently, that does win the approval of God.
060	1PE	002	021	For it was to this that you were called! For Christ, too, suffered – on your behalf – and left you an example, that you should follow in his steps.
060	1PE	002	022	He “never sinned, nor was anything deceitful ever heard from his lips.”
060	1PE	002	023	He was abused, but he did not answer with abuse; he suffered, but he did not threaten; he entrusted himself to him whose judgments are just.
060	1PE	002	024	And he “himself carried our sins” in his own body to the cross, so that we might die to our sins, and live for righteousness. “His bruising was your healing.”
060	1PE	002	025	Once you were straying like sheep, but now you have returned to the shepherd and guardian of your souls.
060	1PE	003	001	Again, you married women should submit to your husbands, so that if any of them reject the message, they may, apart from the message, be won over, by the conduct of their wives,
060	1PE	003	002	as they see your pure, reverent conduct.
060	1PE	003	003	Yours should be, not the external adornment of the arrangement of the hair, the wearing of jewellery, or the putting on of dresses,
060	1PE	003	004	but the inner life with the imperishable beauty of a quiet and gentle spirit; for this is very precious in God’s sight.
060	1PE	003	005	It was by this that the holy women of old, who rested their hopes on God, adorned themselves; submitting to their husbands,
060	1PE	003	006	as Sarah did, who obeyed Abraham, and called him master. And you are her true children, as long as you live good lives, and let nothing terrify you.
060	1PE	003	007	Again, those of you who are married men should live considerately with their wives, showing due regard to their sex, as physically weaker than their own, and not forgetting that they share with you in the gift of life. Then you will be able to pray without hindrance.
060	1PE	003	008	Lastly, you should all be united, sympathetic, full of love for each other, kind-hearted, humble-minded;
060	1PE	003	009	never returning evil for evil, or abuse for abuse, but, on the contrary, blessing. It was to this that you were called – to obtain a blessing!
060	1PE	003	010	“The person who wants to enjoy life and see happy days – they should keep their tongue from evil and their lips from deceitful words,
060	1PE	003	011	they should turn from evil and do good, They should seek for peace and follow after it;
060	1PE	003	012	For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and his ears are attentive to their prayers, but the face of the Lord is set against those who do wrong.”
060	1PE	003	013	Who, indeed, is there to harm you, if you prove yourselves to be eager for what is good?
060	1PE	003	014	Even if you should suffer for righteousness, count yourselves blessed! “Do not let people terrify you, or allow yourselves to be dismayed.”
060	1PE	003	015	Revere the Christ as Lord in your hearts; always ready to give an answer to anyone who asks your reason for the hope that you cherish, but giving it with courtesy and respect,
060	1PE	003	016	and keeping your consciences clear, so that, whenever you are maligned, those who vilify your good and Christian conduct may be put to shame.
060	1PE	003	017	It is better that you should suffer, if that should be God’s will, for doing right, than for doing wrong.
060	1PE	003	018	For Christ himself died to atone for sins once for all – the good on behalf of the bad – that he might bring you to God; his body being put to death, but his spirit entering on new life.
060	1PE	003	019	And it was then that he went and preached to the imprisoned spirits,
060	1PE	003	020	who once were disobedient, at the time when God patiently waited, in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared; in which some few lives, eight in all, were saved by means of water.
060	1PE	003	021	And baptism, which this foreshadowed, now saves you – not the mere cleansing of the body, but the search of a clear conscience after God – through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,
060	1PE	003	022	who has gone into heaven, and is at God’s right hand, where angels and archangels and the powers of heaven now yield submission to him.
060	1PE	004	001	Since, then, Christ suffered in body, arm yourselves with the same resolve as he; for he who has suffered in body has ceased to sin,
060	1PE	004	002	and so will live the rest of his earthly life guided, not by human passions, but by the will of God.
060	1PE	004	003	Surely in the past you have spent time enough living as the Gentiles delight to live. For your path has lain among scenes of debauchery, licentiousness, drunkenness, revelry, hard-drinking, and profane idolatry.
060	1PE	004	004	And, because you do not run to the same extremes of profligacy as others, they are astonished, and malign you.
060	1PE	004	005	But they will have to answer for their conduct to him who is ready to judge both the living and the dead.
060	1PE	004	006	For that was why the good news was told to the dead also – that, after they have been judged in the body, as people are judged, they might live in the spirit, as God lives.
060	1PE	004	007	But the end of all things is near. Therefore exercise self-restraint and be calm, so that you may be able to pray.
060	1PE	004	008	Above all things, let your love for one another be earnest, for “Love throws a veil over countless sins.”
060	1PE	004	009	Never grudge hospitality to one another.
060	1PE	004	010	Whatever the gift that each has received, use it in the service of others, as good stewards of the varied bounty of God.
060	1PE	004	011	When anyone speaks, they should speak as one who is delivering the oracles of God. When anyone is endeavouring to serve others, they should do so in reliance on the strength which God supplies; so that in everything God may be honoured through Jesus Christ – to whom be ascribed all honour and might for ever and ever. Amen.
060	1PE	004	012	Dear friends, do not be astonished at the trial of fire that you are passing through, to test you, as though something strange were happening to you.
060	1PE	004	013	No, the more you share the sufferings of the Christ, the more may you rejoice, that, when the time comes for the manifestation of his glory, you may rejoice and exult.
060	1PE	004	014	If you are insulted for bearing the name of Christ, count yourselves blessed; because the divine glory and the Spirit of God are resting on you.
060	1PE	004	015	I need hardly say that no one among you must suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or a criminal, or for interfering in matters which do not concern Christians.
060	1PE	004	016	But, if someone suffers as a Christian, they should not be ashamed of it; they should bring honour to God even though they bear that name.
060	1PE	004	017	For the time has come for judgment to begin with the house of God; and, if it begins with us, what will be the end of those who reject God’s good news?
060	1PE	004	018	If “a good person is saved only with difficulty, what will become of the godless and the sinful?”
060	1PE	004	019	Therefore, I say, let those who suffer, because God wills it so, commit their lives into the hands of a faithful Creator, and persevere in doing right.
060	1PE	005	001	As for the older ones among you, who are elders in the church, I, their fellow elder, and a witness to the sufferings of the Christ, who will also share in the glory that is to be revealed –
060	1PE	005	002	I beg you to be true shepherds of the flock of God among you, not because you are compelled, but of your own free will; not from a base love of gain, but with a ready spirit;
060	1PE	005	003	not as lords of your charges, but as examples to your flock.
060	1PE	005	004	Then, when the chief shepherd appears, you will win the crown of glory that never fades.
060	1PE	005	005	Again, you younger ones should show deference to the older. And all of you should put on the badge of humility in mutual service, for “God is opposed to the proud, but gives his help to the humble.”
060	1PE	005	006	Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God, so that he may exalt you in his good time,
060	1PE	005	007	laying all your anxieties on him, for he makes you his care.
060	1PE	005	008	Exercise self-control, be watchful. Your adversary, the devil, like a roaring lion, is prowling about, eager to devour you.
060	1PE	005	009	Stand firm against him, strong in your faith; knowing, as you do, that the sufferings which you are undergoing are being endured to the full by the Lord’s followers throughout the world.
060	1PE	005	010	God, from whom all help comes, and who called you, by your union with Christ, into his eternal glory, will, when you have suffered for a little while, himself perfect, establish, strengthen you.
060	1PE	005	011	To him be ascribed dominion for ever. Amen.
060	1PE	005	012	I have been writing to you briefly by the hand of Silas, our true-hearted friend (for so I regard him), to encourage you, and to bear my testimony that in what I have written is to be found the true love of God. On that take your stand.
060	1PE	005	013	Your sister church in “Babylon” sends you greeting, and so does Mark, who is as a son to me.
060	1PE	005	014	Greet one another with the kiss of love. May God give his peace to you all in your union with Christ.

# BOOK	061	2PE	2 Peter	2 Peter
061	2PE	001	001	To those to whom, through the justice of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ, there has been granted faith equally privileged with our own, from Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ.
061	2PE	001	002	May blessing and peace be yours in ever increasing measure, as you advance in the knowledge of God and of Jesus, our Lord.
061	2PE	001	003	For his divine power has given us everything that is needful for a life of piety, as we advance in the knowledge of him who called us by a glorious manifestation of his goodness.
061	2PE	001	004	For it was through this that he gave us what we prize as the greatest of his promises, that through them you might participate in the divine nature, now that you have fled from the corruption in the world, resulting from human passions.
061	2PE	001	005	Yes, and for this reason do your best to supplement your faith by goodness, goodness by knowledge,
061	2PE	001	006	knowledge by self-control, self-control by endurance, endurance by piety,
061	2PE	001	007	piety by mutual affection, and mutual affection by love.
061	2PE	001	008	For, when these virtues are yours, in increasing measure, they prevent your being indifferent to, or destitute of, a fuller knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
061	2PE	001	009	Surely the person who has not these virtues is shortsighted even to blindness, and has chosen to forget that they have been purified from their sins of the past!
061	2PE	001	010	Therefore, friends, do your best to put God’s call and selection of you beyond all doubt; for, if you do this, you will never fall.
061	2PE	001	011	For in this way you will be given a triumphant admission into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ.
061	2PE	001	012	I will, therefore, always be ready to remind you of all this, even though you know it and are firmly established in the truth that you now hold.
061	2PE	001	013	But I think it my duty, as long as I live in this “tent,” to rouse you by awakening memories of the past;
061	2PE	001	014	for I know that the time for this “tent” of mine to be put away is soon coming, as our Lord Jesus Christ himself assured me.
061	2PE	001	015	So I will do my best to enable you, at any time after my departure, to call these truths to mind.
061	2PE	001	016	For we were not following cleverly devised stories when we told you of the coming in power of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we had been eye-witnesses of his majesty.
061	2PE	001	017	For he received honour and glory from God the Father, when from the glory of the Divine Majesty there were borne to his ears words such as these – “This is my dearly loved son, who brings me great joy.”
061	2PE	001	018	These were the words that we heard, borne to our ears from heaven, when we were with him on that sacred mountain.
061	2PE	001	019	And still stronger is the assurance that we have in the teaching of the prophets; to which you will do well to pay attention (as if it were a lamp shining in a gloomy place), until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.
061	2PE	001	020	But first be assured of this: There is no prophetic teaching found in scripture that can be interpreted by a person’s unaided reason;
061	2PE	001	021	for no prophetic teaching ever came in the old days at the mere wish of people, but people, moved by the Holy Spirit, spoke direct from God.
061	2PE	002	001	But there were false prophets also in the nation, just as there will be false teachers among you, people who will secretly introduce ruinous divisions, disowning even the Lord who bought them, and bringing speedy ruin on themselves.
061	2PE	002	002	There will be many, too, who will follow their licentious courses, and cause the way of the truth to be maligned.
061	2PE	002	003	In their covetousness they will try to make you a source of profit by their fabrications; but for a long time past their sentence has not been standing idle, nor their ruin slumbering.
061	2PE	002	004	Remember, God did not spare angels when they sinned, but sent them down to Tartarus, and consigned them to caverns of darkness, to be kept under guard for judgment.
061	2PE	002	005	Nor did he spare the world of old; though he preserved Noah, the preacher of righteousness, and seven others, when he brought a flood on the godless world.
061	2PE	002	006	He condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah and reduced them to ashes, holding them up as a warning to the godless of what was in store for them;
061	2PE	002	007	but he rescued righteous Lot, whose heart was vexed by the wanton licentiousness of his neighbours;
061	2PE	002	008	for, seeing and hearing what he did, as he lived his righteous life among them, day after day, Lot’s righteous soul was tortured by their wicked doings.
061	2PE	002	009	The Lord, therefore, knows how to deliver the pious from temptation, and to keep the wicked, who are even now suffering punishment, in readiness for “the day of judgment” –
061	2PE	002	010	especially those who, following the promptings of their lower nature, indulge their polluting passions and despise all control. Audacious and self-willed, they feel no awe of the celestial beings, maligning them,
061	2PE	002	011	even where angels, though excelling them in strength and power, do not bring against them a malignant charge before the Lord.
061	2PE	002	012	These people, however, like animals without reason, intended by nature to be caught and killed – these people, I say, malign those of whom they know nothing, and will assuredly perish through their own corruption,
061	2PE	002	013	suffering themselves, as the penalty for the suffering that they have inflicted. They think that pleasure consists in the self-indulgence of the moment. They are a stain and a disgrace, indulging, as they do, in their wanton revelry, even while joining you at your feasts.
061	2PE	002	014	They have eyes only for adulteresses, eyes never tired of sin; they entice weak souls; their minds are trained to covet; they live under a curse.
061	2PE	002	015	Leaving the straight road, they have gone astray and followed in the steps of Balaam, the son of Beor, who set his heart on the reward for wrongdoing,
061	2PE	002	016	but was rebuked for his offence. A dumb animal spoke with a human voice, and checked the prophet’s madness.
061	2PE	002	017	These people are like springs without water, or mists driven before a gale; and for them the blackest darkness has been reserved.
061	2PE	002	018	With boastful and foolish talk, they appeal to the passions of people’s lower nature, and, by their profligacy, entice those who are just escaping from the people who live such misguided lives.
061	2PE	002	019	They promise them freedom, while they themselves are slaves to corrupt habits; for a person is the slave of anything to which they give way.
061	2PE	002	020	If, after having escaped the polluting influences of the world, through knowing our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ, people are again entangled in them, and give way to them, their last state has become worse than their first.
061	2PE	002	021	It would, indeed, have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after knowing it, to turn away from the holy command delivered to them.
061	2PE	002	022	In their case is seen the truth of the proverb – “A dog returns to what it has vomited” and “A sow after washing to her wallowing-place in the mud.”
061	2PE	003	001	This, dear friends, is my second letter to you. In both of them I have tried, by appealing to your remembrance, to arouse your better feelings.
061	2PE	003	002	I want you to recall what was foretold by the holy prophets, as well as the command of our Lord and Saviour given to you through your apostles.
061	2PE	003	003	First be assured of this, that, as the age draws to an end, scoffers, led by their own passions,
061	2PE	003	004	will come and ask scoffingly – “Where is his promised coming? Ever since our ancestors passed to their rest, everything remains just as it was when the world was first created!”
061	2PE	003	005	For they wilfully shut their eyes to the fact that long ago the heavens existed; and the earth, also – formed out of water and by the action of water, by the fiat of God;
061	2PE	003	006	and that by the same means the world which then existed was destroyed in a deluge of water.
061	2PE	003	007	But the present heavens and earth, by the same fiat, have been reserved for fire, and are being kept for the day of the judgment and destruction of the godless.
061	2PE	003	008	But you, dear friends, must never shut your eyes to the fact that, to the Lord, one day is the same as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.
061	2PE	003	009	The Lord is not slow to fulfil his promise, as some count slowness; but he is forbearing with you, as it is not his will that any of you should perish, but that all should be brought to repentance.
061	2PE	003	010	The day of the Lord will come like a thief; and on that day the heavens will pass away with a crash, the elements will be burnt up and dissolved, and the earth and all that is in it will be disclosed.
061	2PE	003	011	Now, since all these things are in the process of dissolution, think what you yourselves ought to be – what holy and pious lives you ought to lead,
061	2PE	003	012	while you wait for the coming of the day of God and strive to make it come soon. At its coming the heavens will be dissolved in fire, and the elements melted by heat,
061	2PE	003	013	but we look for new heavens and a new earth, where righteousness will have its home, in fulfilment of the promise of God.
061	2PE	003	014	Therefore, dear friends, in expectation of these things, make every effort to be found by him spotless, blameless, and at peace.
061	2PE	003	015	Regard our Lord’s forbearance as your one hope of salvation. This is what our dear friend Paul wrote to you, with the wisdom that God gave him.
061	2PE	003	016	It is the same in all his letters, when he speaks in them about these subjects. There are some things in them difficult to understand, which untaught and weak people distort, just as they do all other writings, to their own ruin.
061	2PE	003	017	You must, therefore, dear friends, now that you know this beforehand, be on your guard against being led away by the errors of reckless people, and so lapsing from your present steadfastness;
061	2PE	003	018	and advance in the love and knowledge of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ. All glory be to him now and for ever.

# BOOK	062	1JO	1 John	1 John
062	1JO	001	001	We write to you about the Word of life, which has been in existence from the beginning. We write of what we have heard, of what we have seen with our eyes, of what we watched reverently and touched with our hands.
062	1JO	001	002	That life was made visible, and we have seen it. We bear our testimony to it, and tell you of that eternal life which was with the Father and was made visible to us.
062	1JO	001	003	It is of what we have seen and heard that we now tell you, so that you may have fellowship with us. And our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ.
062	1JO	001	004	We are writing all this to you that our joy may be complete.
062	1JO	001	005	This is the message which we have heard from him and announce to you: God is light, and there is no darkness in him at all.
062	1JO	001	006	If we say that we have fellowship with him and yet continue to walk in the darkness, our words and our lives are a lie.
062	1JO	001	007	But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, cleanses us from all sin.
062	1JO	001	008	If we say, ‘we have no sin,’ then we are deceiving ourselves, and the truth is not in us.
062	1JO	001	009	If we confess our sins, he is just and may be trusted to forgive our sins and cleanse us from all wrongdoing.
062	1JO	001	010	If we say that we haven’t sinned, we make God a liar, and his Word is not in us.
062	1JO	002	001	My children, I am writing to you to keep you from sinning. But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father – Jesus Christ, the righteous.
062	1JO	002	002	He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not for ours only, but the sins of the whole world.
062	1JO	002	003	It is by keeping God’s commands that we can be sure we know him.
062	1JO	002	004	Whoever says ‘I know him,’ but does not keep his commands, is a liar. The truth has no place in them.
062	1JO	002	005	But the person who keeps God’s word, in them the love of God has indeed reached its perfection. This is how we can be sure we are in him:
062	1JO	002	006	whoever claims to live in him should live just as Jesus did.
062	1JO	002	007	Dear friends, it is no new command that I am writing to you, but an old command, which you have had from the beginning. That old command is the message you have already heard.
062	1JO	002	008	Yet, in a way, it is a new command that I am writing to you – which is shown true in Christ’s life and in yours – for the darkness is passing away and the true light is already shining.
062	1JO	002	009	The person who says that they are in the light, and yet hates others, is still in the darkness.
062	1JO	002	010	The person who loves others is always in the light, and there is nothing within them to cause them to stumble.
062	1JO	002	011	The person who hates is in the dark. They stumble along in the darkness; they do not know where they are going because the darkness blinds them.
062	1JO	002	012	Little children, I am writing to you because your sins have been forgiven for Christ’s sake.
062	1JO	002	013	Parents, I am writing to you because you have come to know him who has been from the beginning. Young people, I am writing to you because you have conquered the evil one. Children, I write to you because you have come to know the Father.
062	1JO	002	014	Parents, I write to you because you have learned to know him who has been from the beginning. Young people, I write to you because you are strong, and God’s message is always in your hearts, and you have conquered the evil one.
062	1JO	002	015	Do not love the world or what the world can offer. When anyone loves the world, there is no love for the Father in them.
062	1JO	002	016	For all that the world can offer – the desires for physical pleasure, the enticements to the eye, the arrogance of wealth – belongs, not to the Father, but to the world.
062	1JO	002	017	And the world, and all that it gratifies, is passing away, but they who do God’s will remain for ever.
062	1JO	002	018	My children, it is the last hour. You were told that an antichrist was coming; and many antichrists have already arisen. This is why we know that this is the last hour.
062	1JO	002	019	These people come from our ranks, but they were never truly part of us – if they had been then they would have stayed with us. They left so it would be clear that none of them really belonged to us.
062	1JO	002	020	You, however, have been annointed by the Holy One. You all know the truth.
062	1JO	002	021	I am not writing to you because you do not know the truth, but because you do know it, and because no lie can come from the truth.
062	1JO	002	022	Who is a liar, if not the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ? That person is the antichrist – one who rejects the Father and the Son.
062	1JO	002	023	No one who rejects the Son has the Father; to acknowledge the Son is to have the Father also.
062	1JO	002	024	As for you, you must let what you have heard from the beginning continue to live in you. If what you heard from the beginning dwells in you, you will remain both in the Son and the Father.
062	1JO	002	025	And this is what he himself promised us – eternal life!
062	1JO	002	026	In writing this to you, I have in mind those who are trying to mislead you.
062	1JO	002	027	As for you, the anointing which you received from him remains with you. You do not need anyone to teach you. His anointing teaches you about everything. What it teaches you is true, it is not a lie. Do what it has taught you: abide in him.
062	1JO	002	028	Yes, my children, remain in him, so that when he appears our confidence doesn’t fail us, and we are not ashamed to meet him at his coming.
062	1JO	002	029	Since you know he is righteous, you realise that everyone who does what is right is his child.
062	1JO	003	001	See what great love the Father has lavished on us: he lets us be called God’s children! For that is what we are. The reason why the world does not know us is that it has not learned to know him.
062	1JO	003	002	Dear friends, we are God’s children now, and what we will be has not yet been revealed. What we do know is that, when it is revealed, we will be like him, because we will see him as he is.
062	1JO	003	003	And just as he is pure, everyone who has this hope, makes and keeps themselves pure.
062	1JO	003	004	Everyone who lives sinfully is living in violation of God’s law. Sin is lawlessness.
062	1JO	003	005	You know that Christ appeared to take away our sins and that there is no sin in him.
062	1JO	003	006	No one who lives in him continues to sin; the sinner has not seen or known him.
062	1JO	003	007	My children, don’t let anyone mislead you. The person who does what is right is righteous, just as Christ is righteous.
062	1JO	003	008	The person who lives in sin is a child of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. To undo the devil’s work is the reason the Son of God appeared.
062	1JO	003	009	No child of God sins, because God’s nature dwells in them. They can’t live in sin, because they are God’s children.
062	1JO	003	010	By this it is made clear who are the children of God and who are the devil’s: anyone who doesn’t do what is right or doesn’t love others is not a child of God.
062	1JO	003	011	For this is the message we heard from the beginning: we are to love one another.
062	1JO	003	012	We must not be like Cain, who belonged to the evil one and murdered his brother. Why did he kill him? Because his actions were evil, and his brother’s were righteous.
062	1JO	003	013	Do not be suprised, friends, if the world hates you.
062	1JO	003	014	We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love each other. The person who does not love remains in a state of death.
062	1JO	003	015	The person who hates another is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life dwelling within them.
062	1JO	003	016	This is how we know what love is: Christ gave his life for us. So we should lay down our own lives for each other.
062	1JO	003	017	If anyone has material possessions, and sees one of our own in need, but closes their heart against that person, how can it be said that the love of God is within them?
062	1JO	003	018	My children, our love must not be mere words or talk. It must be true and show itself in actions.
062	1JO	003	019	This is how we will know we belong to the truth and reassure ourselves in God’s presence:
062	1JO	003	020	though our conscience condemns us, God is greater than our conscience and knows everything.
062	1JO	003	021	Dear friends, if our conscience does not condemn us, then we approach God with confidence,
062	1JO	003	022	and we receive from him whatever we ask, because we are keeping his commands, and are doing what pleases him.
062	1JO	003	023	His command is that we should believe in his Son, Jesus Christ, and love one another, as Christ commanded us.
062	1JO	003	024	The person who keeps his commands dwells in God and God dwells in them. And we are sure he lives in us because of the Spirit he has given us.
062	1JO	004	001	Dear friends, do not trust every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world.
062	1JO	004	002	This is the way to recognise the Spirit of God: those who acknowledge Jesus Christ as come in the flesh have God’s Spirit,
062	1JO	004	003	while a spirit that doesn’t acknowledge Jesus isn’t from God. Instead it is the spirit of the antichrist; you have heard that it was coming, and it is now already in the world!
062	1JO	004	004	You, my children, come from God, and you have successfully resisted such people as these, because he who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world.
062	1JO	004	005	Those people belong to the world and therefore they speak as the world speaks, and the world listens to them.
062	1JO	004	006	We come from God. Whoever knows God listens to us; the person who does not come from God does not listen to us. This is how we distinguish the spirit of truth and the spirit of deception.
062	1JO	004	007	Dear friends, let us love one another, because love comes from God and everyone who loves is a child of God and knows God.
062	1JO	004	008	Those who do not love know nothing of God, for God is love.
062	1JO	004	009	This is how God showed his love among us: he sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him.
062	1JO	004	010	This is what love is: it is not that we have loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son to be an atoning sacrifice for our sins.
062	1JO	004	011	Dear friends, since God loved us in this way, we should love one another.
062	1JO	004	012	No one has ever seen God, but if we love one another, God lives in us and his love reaches perfection within us.
062	1JO	004	013	We know that we live in him, and he lives in us, because he has given us a measure of his Spirit.
062	1JO	004	014	Moreover, we have seen for ourselves and testify that the Father has sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world.
062	1JO	004	015	Whoever acknowledges that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, God lives in them, and they live in God.
062	1JO	004	016	And so we have come to know and believe the love which God has for us. God is love; and whoever lives in love lives in God, and God lives in them.
062	1JO	004	017	This is the way love has reached its perfection among us, so that we may have confidence on the day of judgment, because in this world we are like Christ.
062	1JO	004	018	There is no fear in love; perfect love drives out fear because fear has to do with punishment. So anyone who is afraid has not reached perfection in love.
062	1JO	004	019	We love, because God first loved us.
062	1JO	004	020	If someone says “I love God,” and yet hates others, they are a liar. For the person who does not love their brother or sister, whom they have seen, cannot love God, whom they have not seen.
062	1JO	004	021	Indeed, we have this command from Christ: Those who love God must also love each other.
062	1JO	005	001	Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is a child of God, and everyone who loves a parent loves his child.
062	1JO	005	002	By this we know that we love God’s children – when we love God and carry out his commands.
062	1JO	005	003	For to love God is to do what he commands and his commands are not a burden,
062	1JO	005	004	for whatever is born of God overcomes the world. What is the victory by which the world is overcome? Our faith!
062	1JO	005	005	Who can overcome the world but the person who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?
062	1JO	005	006	Jesus Christ, the one who came by water and blood – not by water only but by water and blood – and the Spirit testifies to this because the Spirit is truth.
062	1JO	005	007	Indeed three testify:
062	1JO	005	008	the Spirit, the water, and the blood, and these three agree.
062	1JO	005	009	We accept human testimony, surely God’s testimony is even stronger! And God’s testimony is the testimony he has given about his Son.
062	1JO	005	010	The person who believes in the Son of God has that testimony within them. The person who does not believe God has made God a liar, by not believing the testimony God has given about his Son.
062	1JO	005	011	And this is that testimony: God gave us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.
062	1JO	005	012	Whoever has the Son has life; whoever who doesn’t have God’s Son does not have life.
062	1JO	005	013	I have written these things to you who believe in the name of God’s Son, so that you may know that you have eternal life.
062	1JO	005	014	We can approach him with this confidence, that whenever we ask anything that is in accordance with his will, he listens to us.
062	1JO	005	015	And if we know he hears us – whatever we ask – we know also that what we ask for is ours.
062	1JO	005	016	If anyone sees one of our people committing some sin that is not a sin leading to death, they should ask, and God will give them life. I refer to those whose sin does not lead to death. There is a sin that leads to death. I am not saying that you should pray about that.
062	1JO	005	017	All wrongdoing is sin, but there is sin that does not lead to death.
062	1JO	005	018	We know that those who have been born of God do not keep sinning. God protects his children and the evil one cannot get hold of them.
062	1JO	005	019	We know that we are God’s children, though the whole world lies in the power of the evil one.
062	1JO	005	020	We also know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding, so that we may know the true God – and we are in him who is true, by being in his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life.
062	1JO	005	021	My children, guard yourselves against false ideas of God.

# BOOK	063	2JO	2 John	2 John
063	2JO	001	001	From the elder, to the lady chosen by God and her children. I truly love you all, and I am not the only one but all who know the truth love you as well.
063	2JO	001	002	We love you for the sake of the truth, which lives in us and will be with us forever.
063	2JO	001	003	Grace, mercy, and peace will be ours – the gift of God, the Father, and of Jesus Christ, the Father’s Son – in truth and love.
063	2JO	001	004	It was a great joy to me to find the lives of some of your children guided by the truth, in obedience to the command that we received from the Father.
063	2JO	001	005	And now I implore you, dear lady, let us love one another This is not a new command I am writing to you. It is the command we have had from the beginning. – Let us love one another.
063	2JO	001	006	And this is love – to live in obedience to the Father’s commands. This is the command as you learned from the beginning, to live a life of love.
063	2JO	001	007	I say this because many deceivers have gone out into the world – men who do not acknowledge that Jesus Christ came in flesh and blood. Any such person is a deceiver and antichrist.
063	2JO	001	008	Take care so that you do not what we have worked for but instead receive your full reward.
063	2JO	001	009	Anyone who goes beyond and fails to live inside of the teaching of Christ does not have God. The person who lives inside that teaching – they have both the Father and the Son.
063	2JO	001	010	If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive them into your house or even welcome them;
063	2JO	001	011	because the person who welcomes them is sharing with them in his evil work.
063	2JO	001	012	Though I have many other things to tell you, I would rather not use paper and ink. Instead I hope to come and see you, and to speak with you face to face, so that our joy may be complete.
063	2JO	001	013	The children of your sister, who is chosen by God, send you their greetings.

064	3JO	001	001	From the elder to his dear friend Gaius, whom he sincerely loves.
064	3JO	001	002	Dear friend, I pray that all may be well with you and that you may have good health – I know that all is well with your soul.
064	3JO	001	003	For it was a great joy to me, when some followers of the Lord came and testified to your fidelity to the truth. I know that your own life is guided by the truth.
064	3JO	001	004	Nothing gives me greater pleasure than to hear from time to time that the lives of my children are guided by the truth.
064	3JO	001	005	Dear friend, you are faithful in all the things you do for other followers – even when they are strangers to you.
064	3JO	001	006	They themselves have testified before the church to your love. You will do well to help them on their way in a manner worthy of the service of God.
064	3JO	001	007	For it was on behalf of Christ’s name that they set out, not accepting even one thing from the Gentiles.
064	3JO	001	008	Therefore, we should support people like them, and so take our share in their work for the truth.
064	3JO	001	009	I wrote something to the church, but Diotrephes (who loves to be the leader among them) doesn’t welcome us.
064	3JO	001	010	So if I come, I will bring up his actions in telling wicked nonsense about us. Not content with that, he not only refuses to personally welcome our friends who are followers, but actually stops those who would, and expels them from the church.
064	3JO	001	011	Dear friend, do not follow a bad example, but a good one. The person who does what is good is from God; the person who does what is bad has never seen God.
064	3JO	001	012	Everyone has always had a good word for Demetrius, and the truth itself speaks for him. Yes, and we also add our good word, and you know that what we say is true.
064	3JO	001	013	I have many things to tell you, but I would rather not use pen and ink.
064	3JO	001	014	I hope to see you soon, and then we will speak face to face. Peace be with you. The friends here send you their greetings. Greet each one of our friends.

# BOOK	065	JUD	Jude	Jude
065	JUD	001	001	To those who, having received the call, have been loved by God the Father and protected by Jesus Christ, From Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ, and the brother of James.
065	JUD	001	002	May mercy, peace, and love be yours in ever increasing measure.
065	JUD	001	003	Dear friends, while I was making every effort to write to you about our common salvation, I felt that I must write to you at once to encourage you to fight in defence of the faith that has once for all been entrusted to the keeping of Christ’s people.
065	JUD	001	004	For there have crept in among you certain godless people, whose sentence has long since been pronounced, and who make the mercy of God an excuse for profligacy, and disown our only lord and master, Jesus Christ.
065	JUD	001	005	Now I want to remind you – but you already know it all – that, though the Lord delivered the people from Egypt, yet he afterwards destroyed those who refused to believe in him;
065	JUD	001	006	and that even those angels, who did not keep to their appointed spheres, but left their proper homes, have been kept by him for the judgment of the great day in everlasting chains and black darkness.
065	JUD	001	007	Like Sodom and Gomorrah and the towns near them, which gave themselves up to fornication, and fell into unnatural vice, these angels now stand out as a warning, undergoing, as they are, punishment in eternal fire.
065	JUD	001	008	Yet in the same way these people, too, cherishing vain dreams, pollute our human nature, reject control, and malign the celestial beings.
065	JUD	001	009	Yet even Michael, the archangel, when, in his dispute with the devil, he was arguing about the body of Moses, did not venture to charge him with maligning, but said merely “The Lord rebuke you!”
065	JUD	001	010	But these people malign whatever they do not understand; while they use such things as they know by instinct (like the animals that have no reason) for their own corruption.
065	JUD	001	011	Alas for them! They walk in the steps of Cain; led astray by Balaam’s love of gain, they plunge into sin, and meet their ruin through rebellion like Korah.
065	JUD	001	012	These are the people who are blots on your “love-feasts,” when they feast together and provide without scruple for themselves alone. They are clouds without rain, driven before the winds; they are leafless trees without a vestige of fruit, dead through and through, torn up by the roots;
065	JUD	001	013	they are wild sea waves, foaming with their own shame; they are “wandering stars,” for which the blackest darkness has been reserved for ever.
065	JUD	001	014	To these people, as to others, Enoch, the seventh in descent from Adam, declared – “See! The Lord has come with his hosts of holy ones around him,
065	JUD	001	015	to execute judgment on all people, and to convict all godless people of all their godless acts, which in their ungodliness they have committed, and of all the harsh words which they have spoken against him, godless sinners that they are!”
065	JUD	001	016	These people are always murmuring, and complaining of their lot; they follow where their passions lead them; they have arrogant words on their lips; and they flatter others for the sake of what they can get from them.
065	JUD	001	017	But you should, dear friends, recall what was foretold by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;
065	JUD	001	018	how they used to say to you – “As time draws to an end, there will be scoffers, who will be led by their godless passions.”
065	JUD	001	019	These are the people – animal and unspiritual – who cause divisions.
065	JUD	001	020	But you must, dear friends, build up your characters on the foundation of your most holy faith, pray under the guidance of the Holy Spirit,
065	JUD	001	021	and keep within the love of God, while waiting for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ, to bring you to eternal life.
065	JUD	001	022	To some show pity, because they are in doubt. “Drag them out of the fire,” and save them.
065	JUD	001	023	To others show pity, but with caution, hating the clothing polluted by their touch.
065	JUD	001	024	To him who is able to guard you from falling, and to bring you into his glorious presence, blameless and rejoicing –
065	JUD	001	025	to the one God, our Saviour, be ascribed, through Jesus Christ, our Lord, glory, majesty, power, and dominion, as it was before time began, is now, and will be for all time to come. Amen.

066	REV	001	009	I, John, who am your brother, and who share with you in the suffering and kingship and endurance of Jesus, found myself on the island called Patmos, for the sake of the message of God and the testimony to Jesus.
066	REV	001	010	I fell into a trance on the Lord’s day, and I heard behind me a loud voice, like the blast of a trumpet.
066	REV	001	011	It said – “Write what you see in a book and send it to the seven churches, to Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamus, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea.”
066	REV	001	012	I turned to see what voice it was that spoke to me; and when I turned, I saw seven golden lamps,
066	REV	001	013	and in the midst of the lamps one like a man, in a robe reaching to his feet, and with a golden sash across his breast.
066	REV	001	014	The hair of his head was as white as wool, as white as snow; his eyes were like flaming fire;
066	REV	001	015	and his feet were like brass as when molten in a furnace; his voice was like the sound of many streams,
066	REV	001	016	in his right hand he held seven stars, from his mouth came a sharp two-edged sword, and his face was like the sun in the fulness of its power.
066	REV	001	017	And, when I saw him, I fell at his feet like one dead. He laid his hand on me and said – “Do not be afraid. I am the First and the Last,
066	REV	001	018	the Everliving. I died, and I am alive for ever and ever. And I hold the keys of death and of Hades.
066	REV	001	019	Therefore write of what you have seen and of what is happening now and of what is about to take place –
066	REV	001	020	the mystic meaning of the seven stars which you saw in my right hand, and the seven golden lamps. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lamps are the seven churches.
066	REV	002	001	‘To the angel of the church in Ephesus write These are the words of him who holds the seven stars in his right hand, and walks among the seven golden lamps:
066	REV	002	002	I know your life, your toil and endurance, and I know that you cannot tolerate evildoers. I know, too, how you tested those who declare that they are apostles, though they are not, and how you proved them false.
066	REV	002	003	You possess endurance, and have borne much for my name, and have never grown weary.
066	REV	002	004	But this I have against you – You have abandoned your first love.
066	REV	002	005	Therefore remember from what you have fallen, and repent, and live the life that you lived before; or else, I will come and remove your Lamp from its place, unless you repent.
066	REV	002	006	But this is in your favour – You hate the life lived by the Nikolaitans, and I also hate it.
066	REV	002	007	Anyone with ears should hear what the Spirit is saying to the churches. To him who conquers – to him I will give the right to eat the fruit of the Tree of life, which stands in the Paradise of God.
066	REV	002	008	‘To the angel of the church in Smyrna write: These are the words of him who is the First and the Last, who died, but is restored to life:
066	REV	002	009	I know your persecution and your poverty – yet you are rich! I know, too, the slander that comes from those who declare that they are God’s people, though they are not, but are a congregation of Satan.
066	REV	002	010	Do not be afraid of what you are about to suffer. The devil is about to throw some of you into prison so that you may be tempted, and may undergo persecution for ten days. Be faithful even to death, and I will give you the Crown of life.
066	REV	002	011	Let those who have ears hear what the Spirit is saying to the churches. Those who conquer will suffer no hurt from the Second Death.
066	REV	002	012	‘To the angel of the church in Pergamus write: These are the words of him who holds the sharp two-edged sword:
066	REV	002	013	I know where you live, where the throne of Satan stands. And yet you hold to my name, and you did not disown my faith even in the days of Antipas, my faithful witness, who was put to death among you where Satan dwells.
066	REV	002	014	Yet I have a few things against you – You have among you those who hold to the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to put temptations in the way of the Israelites, so that they should eat idol-offerings and commit licentious acts.
066	REV	002	015	Again you have among you those who hold in the same way to the teaching of the Nikolaitans.
066	REV	002	016	Therefore repent, or else, I will come quickly and contend with such people with words that will cut like a sword.
066	REV	002	017	Let those who have ears hear what the Spirit is saying to the churches. To those who conquer – to them I will give a share of the mystic manna, and I will give them a white stone; and on the stone will be inscribed a new name, which no one knows except the person who receives it.
066	REV	002	018	‘To the angel of the church in Thyatira write: These are the words of the Son of God, whose eyes are like flaming fire, and whose feet are like brass:
066	REV	002	019	I know your life, your love, faith, service, and endurance; and I know that your life of late has been better than it was at first.
066	REV	002	020	Yet I have this against you – You tolerate the woman Jezebel, who declares that she is a prophet, and misleads my servants by her teaching, until they commit licentious acts and eat idol-offerings.
066	REV	002	021	I gave her time to repent, but she is determined not to turn from her licentiousness.
066	REV	002	022	Therefore I am laying her on a bed of sickness, and bringing great suffering on those who are unfaithful with her, unless they repent and turn from a life like hers.
066	REV	002	023	I will also put her children to death; and all the churches will learn that I am he who looks into people’s hearts and souls; and I will give to each one of you what their life deserves.
066	REV	002	024	But I say to the rest of you at Thyatira – all who do not accept such teaching, whose who did not learn the secrets of Satan, as people call them – I am not laying on you any further burden;
066	REV	002	025	only hold fast to what you have received, until I come.
066	REV	002	026	To those who conquer and are careful to live my life to the end – to them I will give authority over the nations,
066	REV	002	027	and they will rule them with an iron rod, as when earthen vessels are broken in pieces (as I myself have received from my Father)
066	REV	002	028	and I will give them the morning star.
066	REV	002	029	Let those who have ears hear what the Spirit is saying to the churches.
066	REV	003	001	‘To the angel of the church in Sardis write: These are the words of him who has the seven spirits of God and the seven stars; – I know your life, and that people say of you that you are living, though you are dead.
066	REV	003	002	Be on the watch, and strengthen what still survives, though once it was all but dead; for I have not found your life perfect in the eyes of my God.
066	REV	003	003	Therefore remember what you have received and heard, and lay it to heart and repent. Unless you are on the watch, I will come like a thief, and you will not know at what hour I am coming to you.
066	REV	003	004	Yet there are some few among you at Sardis who did not soil their robes; they will walk with me, robed in white, for they are worthy.
066	REV	003	005	Those who conquer will be clothed in these white robes, and I will not strike their name out of the book of life; but I will own them before my Father, and before his angels.
066	REV	003	006	Let those who have ears hear what the Spirit is saying to the churches.
066	REV	003	007	‘To the angel of the church in Philadelphia write: These are the words of him who is holy and true, who holds the Key of David, who opens and no one will shut, and shuts and no one opens:
066	REV	003	008	I know your life (see, I have set a door open before you which no one is able to shut), I know that, though you have but little strength, you kept my teaching in mind, and did not disown my name.
066	REV	003	009	Listen, I give some of the congregation of Satan, the people who declare that they are God’s people, though they are not, but are lying – I will make them come and bow down at your feet, and they will learn that I loved you.
066	REV	003	010	Because you kept in mind the story of my endurance, I will keep you in the hour of trial that is about to come on the whole world, the hour that will test all who are living on earth.
066	REV	003	011	I will come quickly. Hold to what you have received so that no one may take your crown.
066	REV	003	012	Those who conquer – I will make them a pillar in the Temple of my God; and never more will they leave it; and I will write on them the name of my God and the name of the city of my God, the New Jerusalem, which is coming down out of heaven from my God, and I will write on them my new name.
066	REV	003	013	Let those who have ears hear what the Spirit is saying to the churches.
066	REV	003	014	‘To the angel of the church in Laodicea write: These are the words of the Unchanging One, the witness faithful and true, the beginning of the Creation of God:
066	REV	003	015	I know your life; I know that you are neither cold nor hot. If only you were either cold or hot!
066	REV	003	016	But now, because you are lukewarm, neither hot nor cold, I am about to spit you out of my mouth.
066	REV	003	017	You say “I am rich and have grown rich, and I want for nothing,” and you do not know that you are wretched, miserable, poor, blind, naked!
066	REV	003	018	Therefore I counsel you to buy from me gold which has been refined by fire so that you may grow rich; and white robes, so that you may be clothed and your shameful nakedness be hidden; and ointment to anoint your eyes, so that you may see.
066	REV	003	019	All whom I love I rebuke and discipline. Therefore be in earnest and repent.
066	REV	003	020	I am standing at the door and knocking! If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will go in, and will feast with them, and they will feast with me.
066	REV	003	021	To those who conquer – to them I will give the right to sit beside me on my throne, as I, when I conquered, took my seat beside my Father on his throne.
066	REV	003	022	Let those who have ears hear what the Spirit is saying to the churches.’
066	REV	004	001	After this, in my vision, I saw an open door in the heavens, and the first voice that I heard was like the blast of a trumpet speaking to me. It said – “Come up here and I will show you what must take place.”
066	REV	004	002	Immediately after this I fell into a trance. There stood a throne in heaven, and on the throne was One seated.
066	REV	004	003	He who was seated on it was in appearance like a jasper and a sardius; and round the throne there was a rainbow of the colour of an emerald.
066	REV	004	004	And round the throne were twenty-four other thrones, and on these I saw twenty-four elders sitting clothed in white robes; and on their heads they had crowns of gold.
066	REV	004	005	Out from the throne come flashes of lightning, cries, and peals of thunder! There are seven torches burning in front of the throne, which are the seven spirits of God;
066	REV	004	006	and in front of the throne is what seemed to be a sea of glass, resembling crystal, while within the space before the throne and round the throne are four creatures full of eyes in front and behind.
066	REV	004	007	The first creature is like a lion, the second creature like a calf, the third creature has a face like a man’s, and the fourth creature is like an eagle on the wing.
066	REV	004	008	These four creatures have each of them six wings, and all round, and within, they are full of eyes; and day and night they never cease to say – “Holy, holy, holy is the Lord, our God, the Almighty, who was, and who is, and who will be.”
066	REV	004	009	And, whenever these creatures give praise and honour and thanks to him who is seated on the throne, to him who lives for ever and ever,
066	REV	004	010	the twenty-four elders prostrate themselves before him who is seated on the throne, and worship him who lives for ever and ever, and throw down their crowns before the throne, saying –
066	REV	004	011	“Worthy are you, our Lord and God, to receive all praise, and honour, and power, for you did create all things, and at your bidding they came into being and were created.”
066	REV	005	001	Then I saw at the right hand of him who was seated on the throne a book, with writing inside and out, and sealed with seven seals;
066	REV	005	002	and I saw a mighty angel who was proclaiming in a loud voice – “Who is worthy to open the book and break its seals?”
066	REV	005	003	But no one either in heaven or on earth or under the earth was able to open the book or look within it.
066	REV	005	004	At this I wept long, because no one could be found who was worthy to open the book or look within it.
066	REV	005	005	But one of the elders said to me – “Do not weep. The Lion conquered – the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Scion of David – and can therefore open the book with its seven seals.”
066	REV	005	006	Then, within the space between the throne and the four creatures, and in the midst of the elders, I saw, standing, a Lamb, which seemed to have been sacrificed. It had seven horns and seven eyes. (These eyes are the seven spirits of God, and they are sent into all the world.)
066	REV	005	007	The Lamb came forward; and he has taken the book from the right hand of him who was seated on the throne.
066	REV	005	008	And, when he had taken the book, the four creatures and the twenty-four elders prostrated themselves before the Lamb, each of them holding a harp and golden bowls full of incense. (These are the prayers of Christ’s people.)
066	REV	005	009	And they are singing a new song – “You are worthy to take the book and break its seals, for you were sacrificed, and with your blood you did buy for God people of every tribe, and language, and people, and nation,
066	REV	005	010	and did make them a kingdom of priests in the service of our God, and they are reigning on the earth.”
066	REV	005	011	Then, in my vision, I heard the voices of many angels round the throne, and of the creatures, and of the elders. In number they were ten thousand times ten thousand and thousands of thousands,
066	REV	005	012	and they cried in a loud voice – “Worthy is the Lamb that was sacrificed to receive all power, and wealth, and wisdom, and might, and honour, and praise, and blessing.”
066	REV	005	013	And I heard every created thing in the air, and on the earth, and under the earth, and on the sea, and all that is in them crying – “To him who is seated on the throne and to the Lamb be ascribed all blessing, and honour, and praise, and dominion for ever and ever.”
066	REV	005	014	And the four creatures said “Amen,” and the elders prostrated themselves and worshiped.
066	REV	006	001	Then I saw the Lamb break one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four creatures crying with a voice like thunder – “Come.”
066	REV	006	002	And in my vision I saw a white horse. Its rider held a bow, and he was given a crown, and he went out conquering and to conquer.
066	REV	006	003	When the Lamb broke the second seal, I heard the second creature crying – “Come.”
066	REV	006	004	Then there went out another horse, a red horse, and to its rider was given the power to deprive the earth of peace, so that people should kill one another; and he was given a great sword.
066	REV	006	005	When the Lamb broke the third seal, I heard the third creature crying – “Come.” And in my vision I saw a black horse. Its rider held scales in his hand.
066	REV	006	006	And I heard what seemed to be a voice, coming from among the four creatures, crying – “A quart of wheat for a silver coin, and three quarts of barley for a silver coin! But do not harm the oil and the wine.”
066	REV	006	007	When the Lamb broke the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth creature crying – “Come.”
066	REV	006	008	And in my vision I saw a grey horse. His rider’s name was Death, and Hades rode behind him; and power was given them over the fourth part of the earth, so that they might destroy with sword and famine and death, and by means of the wild Beasts of the earth.
066	REV	006	009	When the Lamb opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been killed for the sake of God’s message and for the testimony which they had borne.
066	REV	006	010	They cried in a loud voice – “How long, Sovereign Lord, holy and true, before you will give judgment and avenge our blood on all who are living on the earth?”
066	REV	006	011	Then to each of them was given a white robe, and they were told to rest yet a little longer, until the number of their fellow servants and of their friends in Christ’s service who were about to be put to death, as they had been, should be complete.
066	REV	006	012	And I saw the Lamb break the sixth seal, and then there was a great earthquake. The sun became black, like sackcloth, and the moon, which was at its full, like blood.
066	REV	006	013	The stars of the heavens fell to the earth, as when a fig tree, shaken by a strong wind, drops its unripe fruit.
066	REV	006	014	The heavens disappeared like a scroll when it is rolled up, and every mountain and island was moved from its place.
066	REV	006	015	Then all the kings of the earth, and the princes, and the generals, and the rich, and the powerful, and every slave and free person, hid themselves in the caves and under the rocks of the mountains;
066	REV	006	016	and they are crying to the mountains and the rocks – “Fall on us, and hide us from the eyes of him who is seated on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb,
066	REV	006	017	for the great day of their wrath is come, and who can stand to meet it?”
066	REV	007	001	After this, I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, restraining the four winds of the earth, so that no wind should blow over the earth, or over the sea, or against any tree.
066	REV	007	002	And, in the east, I saw another angel, ascending, holding the seal of the living God; and he cried in a loud voice to the four angels, to whom there had been given power to harm the earth and the sea –
066	REV	007	003	“Do not harm the earth, or the sea, or the trees, until we have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads.”
066	REV	007	004	I heard, too, the number of those who had been sealed. It was one hundred and forty-four thousand; and they were from every tribe of the Israelites.
066	REV	007	005	From the tribe of Judah twelve thousand were sealed, from the tribe of Reuben twelve thousand, from the tribe of Gad twelve thousand,
066	REV	007	006	from the tribe of Asher twelve thousand, from the tribe of Napthali twelve thousand, from the tribe of Manasseh twelve thousand,
066	REV	007	007	from the tribe of Simeon twelve thousand, from the tribe of Levi twelve thousand, from the tribe of Issachar twelve thousand,
066	REV	007	008	from the tribe of Zebulon twelve thousand, from the tribe of Joseph twelve thousand, from the tribe of Benjamin twelve thousand were sealed.
066	REV	007	009	After this, in my vision, I saw a vast throng which no one could number, of people from every nation and of all tribes, and peoples, and languages. They stood in front of the throne and in front of the Lamb, robed in white, holding palm branches in their hands.
066	REV	007	010	And they are crying in a loud voice – “Salvation be ascribed to our God who is seated on his throne and to the Lamb.”
066	REV	007	011	And all the angels were standing round the throne and the elders and the four creatures, and they prostrated themselves on their faces in front of the throne and worshiped God,
066	REV	007	012	saying – “Amen. Blessing and praise, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honour, and power, and might be ascribed to our God for ever and ever. Amen.”
066	REV	007	013	Then one of the elders turned to me and said “Who are these who are robed in white? And where did they come from?”
066	REV	007	014	“My Lord,” I answered, “it is you who know.” “These,” he said, “are they who come through the Great Persecution; they washed their robes white in the blood of the Lamb.
066	REV	007	015	And therefore it is that they are before the throne of God, and are serving him day and night in his Temple; and he who is seated on the throne will shelter them.
066	REV	007	016	Never again will they be hungry, never again will they be thirsty, nor will the sun smite them, nor any scorching heat;
066	REV	007	017	for the Lamb that stands in the space before the throne will be their shepherd, and will lead them to life-giving springs of water; and God will wipe away all tears from their eyes.”
066	REV	008	001	As soon as the Lamb had broken the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for, it might be, half an hour.
066	REV	008	002	Then I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them.
066	REV	008	003	Next, another angel came and stood at the altar with a golden censer in his hand; and a great quantity of incense was given to him, to mingle with the prayers of all Christ’s people on the golden altar before the throne.
066	REV	008	004	The smoke of the incense ascended, with the prayers of Christ’s people, from the hand of the angel before God.
066	REV	008	005	Then the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire from the altar, and threw it down on the earth; and there followed peals of thunder, cries, flashes of lightning, and an earthquake.
066	REV	008	006	Then the seven angels holding the seven trumpets prepared to blow their blasts.
066	REV	008	007	The first blew; and there came hail and fire mixed with blood, and it fell on the earth. A third part of the earth was burnt up, and a third of the trees, and every blade of grass.
066	REV	008	008	Then the second angel blew; and what appeared to be a great mountain, burning, was hurled into the sea. A third of the sea became blood,
066	REV	008	009	and a third part of all created things that are in the sea – that is, of all living things – died, and a third of the ships was destroyed.
066	REV	008	010	Then the third angel blew; and there fell from the heavens a great star, burning like a torch. It fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs.
066	REV	008	011	(The star is called “Wormwood.”) A third of the water became bitter as wormwood, and so bitter was the water that many died from drinking it.
066	REV	008	012	Then the fourth angel blew; and a third of the sun and a third of the moon and a third of the stars were blasted, so that a third of them was eclipsed, and for a third part of the day there was no light, and at night it was the same.
066	REV	008	013	And, in my vision, I heard an eagle flying in mid-heaven and crying in a loud voice – “Woe, woe, woe for all who live on the earth, at the other trumpet-blasts of the three angels who have yet to blow.”
066	REV	009	001	Then the fifth angel blew; and I saw a star that had fallen on the earth from the heavens, and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit.
066	REV	009	002	He opened the bottomless pit, and from the pit rose a smoke like the smoke of a great furnace. The sun and the air grew dark because of the smoke from the pit.
066	REV	009	003	Out of the smoke locusts descended on the earth, and they received the same power as that possessed by scorpions.
066	REV	009	004	They were told not to harm the grass, or any plant, or any tree, but only those who have not the seal of God on their foreheads.
066	REV	009	005	Yet they were not allowed to kill them, but it was ordered that those men should be tortured for five months. Their torture was like the torture caused by a scorpion when it stings a person.
066	REV	009	006	In those days people will seek Death and will not find it; They will long to die, but Death flees from them.
066	REV	009	007	In appearance the locusts were like horses equipped for battle. On their heads there were what appeared to be crowns that shone like gold, their faces resembled human faces,
066	REV	009	008	and they had hair like the hair of a woman, their teeth were like lions’ teeth,
066	REV	009	009	and they had what seemed to be iron breastplates, while the noise of their wings was like the noise of chariots drawn by many horses, galloping into battle.
066	REV	009	010	They have tails like scorpions, and stings, and in their tails lies their power to harm people for five months.
066	REV	009	011	They have as their king the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name, in Hebrew, is “Abaddon,” while, in Greek, his name is “Apollyon” (the Destroyer).
066	REV	009	012	The first Woe has passed; and still there are two Woes to follow!
066	REV	009	013	Then the sixth angel blew; and I heard a voice proceeding from the corners of the golden altar that stood before God.
066	REV	009	014	It spoke to the sixth angel – the angel with the trumpet – and said “Let loose the four angels that are in chains at the great river Euphrates.”
066	REV	009	015	Then the four angels, that were held in readiness for that hour and day and month and year, were let loose, to destroy a third of mankind.
066	REV	009	016	The number of the hosts of cavalry was ten thousand times ten thousand, twice told; I heard their number.
066	REV	009	017	And this is what the horses and their riders appeared to be like in my vision: They had breastplates of fire, blood-red and sulphurous, and the heads of the horses were like lions’ heads, while out of their mouths issue fire, and smoke, and sulphur.
066	REV	009	018	Through these three curses a third of humanity perished – because of the fire, and the smoke, and the sulphur that issued from their mouths;
066	REV	009	019	for the power of the horses lies in their mouths and in their tails. For their tails are like snakes, with heads, and it is with them that they do harm.
066	REV	009	020	But those who were left of humanity, who had not perished through these curses, did not repent and turn away from what their own hands had made; they would not abandon the worship of demons, and of idols made of gold or silver or brass or stone or wood, which can neither see, nor hear, nor walk;
066	REV	009	021	and they did not repent of their murders, or their sorceries, or their licentiousness, or their thefts.
066	REV	010	001	Then I saw another mighty angel, descending from heaven. His robe was a cloud; over his head was the rainbow; his face was like the sun, and his feet like pillars of fire;
066	REV	010	002	in his hand he held a little book open. He set his right foot on the sea, and his left on the land;
066	REV	010	003	and he cried in a loud voice like the roaring of a lion. At his cry the seven peals of thunder spoke, each with its own voice.
066	REV	010	004	And, when they spoke, I was about to write; but I heard a voice from heaven say – “Keep secret what the seven peals of thunder said, and do not write it down.”
066	REV	010	005	Then the angel, whom I had seen standing on the sea and on the land, raised his right hand to the heavens,
066	REV	010	006	and swore by him who lives for ever and ever, who created the heavens and all that is in them, and the earth and all that is in it, and the sea and all that is in it, that time should cease to be.
066	REV	010	007	Moreover at the time when the seventh angel will speak, when he is ready to blow his blast, then the hidden purposes of God, of which he told the good news to his servants, the prophets, are at once fulfilled.
066	REV	010	008	Then came the voice which I had heard from heaven. It spoke to me again, and said – “Go and take the book that is open in the hand of the angel who stands on the sea and on the land.”
066	REV	010	009	So I went to the angel and asked him to give me the little book. And he said “Take it, and eat it. It will be bitter to your stomach, but in your mouth it will be as sweet as honey.”
066	REV	010	010	I took the little book out of the angel’s hand and ate it, and, while in my mouth, it was like the sweetest honey; but, when I had eaten it, it was bitter to my stomach.
066	REV	010	011	And I was told – “You must prophesy again about men of many peoples, and nations, and languages, and about many kings.”
066	REV	011	001	Then I was given a measure like a rod, and a voice said to me – “Go and measure the Temple of God and the altar, and count the worshiper there.
066	REV	011	002	But omit the court outside the Temple, and do not measure that, for it has been given up to the nations; and the holy City will be under their heel for forty-two months.
066	REV	011	003	Then I will give permission to my Two Witnesses, and for those twelve hundred and sixty days they will continue teaching, clothed in sackcloth.”
066	REV	011	004	These men are represented by the two olive trees and the two lamps that stand before the Lord of the earth.
066	REV	011	005	When anyone wishes to harm them, fire comes from their mouths and consumes their enemies; and whoever wishes to harm them will, in this way, inevitably perish.
066	REV	011	006	These men have the power to close the heavens, so that no rain may fall during the time that they are teaching; and they have power to turn the streams into blood, and to smite the land with any curse, whenever they will.
066	REV	011	007	As soon as they have completed their testimony, the wild Beast that ascends from the bottomless pit will make war on them and conquer and kill them.
066	REV	011	008	Their dead bodies will lie in the streets of the great city, which is mystically spoken of as “Sodom” and “Egypt,” where their Master was crucified.
066	REV	011	009	People of all nations, and tribes, and languages, and races look at their dead bodies for three days and a half, and do not allow them to be laid in a grave.
066	REV	011	010	Those who live on the earth rejoice over them and are merry, and they will send presents to one another, because these two prophets brought torments on those who live on the earth.
066	REV	011	011	After three days and a half the life-giving breath of God entered these men, and they stood up on their feet, and a great terror took possession of those who were watching them.
066	REV	011	012	The two men heard a loud voice from heaven which said to them – “Come up here,” and they went up to heaven in the cloud, while their enemies watched them.
066	REV	011	013	At that very time a great earthquake occurred. A tenth part of the city fell, and seven thousand people perished in the earthquake. Those who escaped were much terrified, and praised the God of heaven.
066	REV	011	014	The second Woe has passed; and there is a third Woe soon to follow!
066	REV	011	015	Then the seventh angel blew; and loud voices were heard in heaven saying – “The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and he will reign for ever and ever.”
066	REV	011	016	At this the twenty-four elders, who were seated on their thrones before God, prostrated themselves on their faces and worshiped him,
066	REV	011	017	saying – “We thank you, Lord, our God, the Almighty, who is and who was, that you have assumed your great power and reigned.
066	REV	011	018	The nations were enraged, and your wrath fell on them; the time came for the dead to be judged, and for you to give the reward to your servants the prophets, and to the people of Christ, and to those who honour your name – the high and the low alike – and to destroy those who are destroying the earth.”
066	REV	011	019	Then the Temple of God in heaven was opened, and the ark containing his covenant was seen in his Temple; and there followed flashes of lightning, cries, peals of thunder, an earthquake, and a great storm of hail.
066	REV	012	001	Then a great portent was seen in the heavens – a woman whose robe was the sun, and who had the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars.
066	REV	012	002	She was pregnant; and she is crying out in the pain and agony of childbirth.
066	REV	012	003	Another portent also was seen in the heavens There was a great red Dragon, with seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads were seven diadems.
066	REV	012	004	His tail draws after it a third of the stars in the heavens, and it hurled them down on the earth. The Dragon is standing in front of the woman who is about to give birth to the child, so that he may devour it as soon as it is born.
066	REV	012	005	The woman gave birth to a son, a male child, who is destined to rule all the nations with an iron rod; and her child was at once caught up to God on his throne.
066	REV	012	006	But the woman fled into the wilderness, where there is a place prepared for her by God, to be tended there for twelve hundred and sixty days.
066	REV	012	007	Then a battle took place in the heavens. Michael and his angels fought with the Dragon. But though the Dragon, with his angels, fought,
066	REV	012	008	he did not prevail; and there was no place left for them any longer in the heavens.
066	REV	012	009	Then the great Dragon, the primeval snake, known as the “devil” and “Satan,” who deceives all the world, was hurled down to the earth, and his angels were hurled down with him.
066	REV	012	010	And I heard a loud voice in heaven which said – “Now has begun the day of the salvation, and Power, and Dominion of our God, and the Rule of his Christ; for the Accuser of our people has been hurled down, he who has been accusing them before our God day and night.
066	REV	012	011	Their victory was due to the blood of the Lamb, and to the message to which they bore their testimony. In their love of life they shrank not from death.
066	REV	012	012	Therefore, be glad, heaven, and all who live in heaven! Alas for the earth and for the sea, for the devil has gone down to you in great fury, knowing that he has but little time.”
066	REV	012	013	When the Dragon saw that he was hurled down to the earth, he pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child.
066	REV	012	014	But to the woman were given the two wings of the great eagle, so that she might fly to her place in the wilderness, where she is being tended for one year, and for two years, and for half a year in safety from the snake.
066	REV	012	015	Then the snake poured water from its mouth after the woman, like a river, so that it might sweep her away.
066	REV	012	016	But Earth came to her help, and opened her mouth and drank up the river which the Dragon had poured out of its mouth.
066	REV	012	017	The Dragon was enraged at the woman, and went to fight with the rest of her offspring – those who lay to heart the commands of God and bear their testimony to Jesus;
066	REV	013	001	and he took his stand on the sea-shore. Then I saw, rising out of the sea, a wild Beast with ten horns and seven heads. On its horns were ten diadems, and on its heads were blasphemous names.
066	REV	013	002	The Beast that I saw was like a leopard; but its feet were like a bear’s, and its mouth like the mouth of a lion. The Dragon gave it his power and his throne, and wide dominion.
066	REV	013	003	One of its heads seemed to me to have been mortally wounded, but its deadly wound had been healed. The whole earth followed the Beast, wondering;
066	REV	013	004	and men worshiped the Dragon, because he had given his dominion to the Beast; while, as they worshiped the Beast, they said – “Who can compare with the Beast? And who can fight with it?”
066	REV	013	005	The Beast was given a mouth that spoke proudly and blasphemously, and it was empowered to work its will for forty-two months.
066	REV	013	006	It opened its mouth only to blaspheme God, to blaspheme his name and his tent – those who live in his tent in heaven.
066	REV	013	007	It had been permitted to fight with Christ’s people and to conquer them, and it had received power over men of every tribe, and people, and language, and nation.
066	REV	013	008	All who are living on earth will worship it – all whose names have not been written in the Lamb’s book of life, the Lamb that has been sacrificed from the foundation of the world.
066	REV	013	009	Let those who have ears hear.
066	REV	013	010	Whoever is destined for captivity goes into captivity. Whoever will kill with the sword must inevitably be killed with the sword. (Here there is need for endurance and faith on the part of Christ’s people.)
066	REV	013	011	Then I saw, rising out of the earth, another wild Beast. It had two horns like those of a lamb, and its voice was like a dragon’s.
066	REV	013	012	It exercises all the authority of the first Beast under its eyes; and it makes the earth and all who are living on it worship that first Beast, whose mortal wound was healed.
066	REV	013	013	It performs great marvels, even causing fire to fall from the heavens to the earth, before people’s eyes;
066	REV	013	014	and in consequence of the marvels which it was allowed to perform under the eyes of the Beast, it is able to deceive all who are living on the earth. It tells those who live on the earth to make a statue in honour of the Beast, who, despite the wound from the sword, yet lived.
066	REV	013	015	It was permitted to breathe life into the image of the Beast, so that the image of the Beast might speak; and it was also permitted to cause all who refused to worship the image of the Beast to be put to death.
066	REV	013	016	High and low, rich and poor, free and enslaved – it causes a brand to be put on the right hand or on the forehead of every one of them,
066	REV	013	017	so that no one is able to buy or sell, except those that bear this brand – either the name of the Beast or the number indicated by the letters of his name.
066	REV	013	018	(Here there is need for discernment.) The person with ability can compute the number of the Beast; for the number indicates a person’s name. Its number is six hundred and sixty-six.
066	REV	014	001	Then, in my vision, I saw the Lamb standing on Mount Zion. With him were a hundred and forty-four thousand, with his name and the name of his Father written on their foreheads.
066	REV	014	002	And I heard a sound from heaven, like the sound of many waters, and like the sound of a loud peal of thunder; the sound that I heard was like the music of harpers playing on their harps.
066	REV	014	003	They are singing what seems to be a new song, before the throne, and before the four creatures and the elders; and no one was able to learn that song except the hundred and forty-four thousand who had been redeemed from earth.
066	REV	014	004	These are the men who never defiled themselves in their intercourse with women; they are as pure as virgins. These are the men who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. They were redeemed as the first-fruits of mankind for God and for the Lamb.
066	REV	014	005	No lie was ever heard on their lips. They are beyond reach of blame.
066	REV	014	006	Then I saw another angel, flying in mid-heaven. He had the good news, decreed from eternity, to announce to those who live on the earth – to men of every nation, and tribe, and language, and people;
066	REV	014	007	and he cried in a loud voice – “Reverence God, and give him praise (for the hour of his judgment has come) and worship him who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all springs of water.”
066	REV	014	008	Then a second angel followed, crying – “She has fallen! She has fallen – Babylon the Great, who has made all the nations drink the maddening wine of her licentiousness!”
066	REV	014	009	Then a third angel followed them, crying in a loud voice – “Whoever worships the Beast and its image, and receives its brand on his forehead or on his hand,
066	REV	014	010	that person will drink the maddening wine of God that has been poured unmixed into the cup of his wrath, and they will be tortured with fire and sulphur before the eyes of the holy angels and before the eyes of the Lamb.
066	REV	014	011	The smoke from their torture rises for ever and ever, and they have no rest day nor night – those who worship the Beast and its image, and all who are branded with its name.”
066	REV	014	012	(Here there is need for endurance on the part of Christ’s people – those who lay to heart the commands of God and the faith of Jesus.)
066	REV	014	013	Then I heard a voice from heaven saying “Write: ‘Blessed are the dead who from this hour die in union with the Lord.’” ‘Yes,’ answers the Spirit, ‘that they may rest from their toil. Their good deeds go with them.’
066	REV	014	014	Then, in my vision, I saw a white cloud, and on the cloud there was sitting one like a man. On his head he had a crown of gold, and in his hand a sharp sickle.
066	REV	014	015	Then another angel came out from the Temple, crying in a loud voice to him who was sitting on the cloud – “Take your sickle and reap, for the time to reap has come; the Harvest of Earth is ready.”
066	REV	014	016	He who was sitting on the cloud brought his sickle down on the earth, and the Harvest of Earth was reaped.
066	REV	014	017	Then another angel came out of the Temple in heaven; he, also, had a sharp sickle.
066	REV	014	018	Then another angel came out of the altar; he had power over fire, and he called in a loud voice to the angel that had the sharp sickle – “Take your sharp sickle, and gather the bunches from the vine of Earth, for its grapes are ripe.”
066	REV	014	019	The angel brought his sickle down on the earth and gathered the fruit of the vine of Earth, and threw it into the great winepress of the wrath of God.
066	REV	014	020	The grapes were trodden in the press outside the city; and blood came out of the press, rising as high as the bridles of the horses for a distance of two hundred miles.
066	REV	015	001	Then I saw another portent in the heavens – a great and marvellous portent – seven angels with the seven last curses; because with them the wrath of God is ended.
066	REV	015	002	Then I saw what appeared to be a sea of glass mixed with fire; and, standing by this sea of glass, holding the harps of God, I saw those who had come victorious out of the conflict with the Beast and its image and the number that formed its name.
066	REV	015	003	They are singing the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb – “Great and marvellous are your deeds, Lord, our God, the Almighty. Righteous and true are your ways, eternal King.
066	REV	015	004	Who will not honour and praise your name, Lord? You alone are holy! All nations will come and worship before you, for your judgments have become manifest.”
066	REV	015	005	After this I saw that the inmost shrine of the tent of testimony in heaven was opened,
066	REV	015	006	and out of it came the seven angels with the seven curses. They were adorned with precious stones, pure and bright, and had golden girdles round their breasts.
066	REV	015	007	One of the four creatures gave the seven angels seven golden bowls, filled with the wrath of God who lives for ever and ever.
066	REV	015	008	The Temple was filled with smoke from the glory and majesty of God; and no one could enter the Temple, until the seven curses inflicted by the seven angels were at an end.
066	REV	016	001	Then I heard a loud voice, which came from the Temple, saying to the seven angels – “Go and empty the seven bowls of the wrath of God on the earth.”
066	REV	016	002	The first angel went and emptied his bowl on the earth; and it turned to loathsome and painful sores on all who bore the brand of the Beast and who worshiped its image.
066	REV	016	003	Then the second angel emptied his bowl on the sea; and it turned to blood like the blood of a corpse, and every living thing died – everything in the sea.
066	REV	016	004	Then the third angel emptied his bowl on the rivers and springs of water; and it turned to blood.
066	REV	016	005	And I heard the angel of the Waters saying – “Righteous are you, you who is and who is, the Holy One, in inflicting this judgment;
066	REV	016	006	for men shed the blood of Christ’s people and of the prophets, and you have given them blood to drink. It is what they deserve.”
066	REV	016	007	And I heard the response from the altar – “Yes, Lord, our God, the Almighty, true and righteous are they judgments.”
066	REV	016	008	Then the fourth angel emptied his bowl on the sun; and he was permitted to scorch men with fire;
066	REV	016	009	and men were scorched by the intense heat. They blasphemed the name of God who controlled these curses, yet they did not repent and give him praise.
066	REV	016	010	Then the fifth angel emptied his bowl on the throne of the Beast; and darkness fell on its kingdom. Men gnawed their tongues for pain,
066	REV	016	011	and blasphemed the God of heaven, because of their pains and because of their sores; yet they did not repent of what they had done.
066	REV	016	012	Then the sixth angel emptied his bowl on the great river Euphrates; and the water in the river was dried up, so that the road for the kings of the East might be made ready.
066	REV	016	013	And I saw three foul spirits, like frogs, come from the mouth of the Dragon and from the mouth of the Beast and from the mouth of the false prophet.
066	REV	016	014	They are the spirits of demons, and perform marvels; they go to kings all over the world, to collect them for the battle on the great day of Almighty God.
066	REV	016	015	(“I am coming like a thief! Happy will he be who is on the watch, and keeps his clothing at hand, so that he will not have to walk about unclothed and let men see his nakedness.”)
066	REV	016	016	And the spirits collected the kings at the place called in Hebrew “Har-Magedon.”
066	REV	016	017	Then the seventh angel emptied his bowl on the air. (A loud voice came from the throne in the Temple; it said “All is over.”)
066	REV	016	018	There followed flashes of lightning, cries, and peals of thunder; and there was a great earthquake, such as had not occurred since man began to be on the earth – none so great;
066	REV	016	019	and the great city was torn in three, and the cities of the nation fell, and God remembered Babylon the Great, and gave her the maddening wine-cup of his wrath;
066	REV	016	020	and every island vanished, and the mountains disappeared.
066	REV	016	021	Great hailstones, a pound in weight, are falling on men from the heavens. And men blasphemed God because of the curse of the hail, for it was a very terrible curse.
066	REV	017	001	Then one of the seven angels who held the seven bowls came and spoke to me. “Come here,” he said, “and I will show you the sentence passed on that infamous prostitute who is seated at the meeting of many waters,
066	REV	017	002	and with whom all the kings of the earth have had licentious intercourse; while all who live on the earth have been make drunk by the wine of her licentiousness.”
066	REV	017	003	And he bore me away in a trance to a lonely place, and I saw a woman seated on a scarlet Beast, which was covered with blasphemous names; it had seven heads and ten horns.
066	REV	017	004	The woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and glittering with gold ornaments, precious stones, and pearls. In her hand she held a gold cup, full of idolatrous abominations, and the unclean fruits of her licentiousness;
066	REV	017	005	while on her forehead was inscribed a name that had a hidden meaning: “Babylon the Great, mother of all prostitutes, source of all obscenities on earth.”
066	REV	017	006	And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of Christ’s people and with the blood of the martyrs for Jesus. When I saw her, I was amazed beyond measure;
066	REV	017	007	but the angel said to me – “Why were you amazed? I will tell you the mystic meaning of the vision of this woman, and of the Beast, with the seven heads and ten horns, that carries her.
066	REV	017	008	The Beast that you saw was, but is not, and is about to rise out of the bottomless pit, and is on its way to destruction. Those who are living on earth will be amazed – those whose names have not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world – when they see that the Beast was, but is not, and yet will come.”
066	REV	017	009	(Here there is need for the discerning mind.) The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman is seated.
066	REV	017	010	They are also seven kings; of whom five have fallen and one remains, while one is not yet come. When he comes, he must stay for a little while.
066	REV	017	011	So must the Beast that was, but is not. He counts as an eighth king, although he is one of the seven, and is on his way to destruction.
066	REV	017	012	The ten horns that you saw are ten kings, who have not yet received their kingdoms, but for an hour they receive the authority of kings, together with the Beast.
066	REV	017	013	These kings are of one mind in surrendering their power and authority to the Beast.
066	REV	017	014	They will fight with the Lamb, but the Lamb will conquer them, for he is Lord of lords and King of kings; so, too, will those with him who have received the call and are chosen and faithful.
066	REV	017	015	And the angel said to me – “The waters that you saw, where the prostitute is seated, are throngs of people and men of all nations and languages.
066	REV	017	016	The ten horns that you saw, and the Beast – they will hate the prostitute, and cause her to become deserted and strip her bare; they will eat her flesh and utterly consume her with fire.
066	REV	017	017	For God has put it into their minds to carry out his purpose, in carrying out their common purpose and surrendering their kingdoms to the Beast, until God’s decrees will be executed.
066	REV	017	018	As for the woman whom you saw, she is the great city that holds sway over all the kings of the earth.”
066	REV	018	001	After this I saw another angel, descending from heaven, invested with great authority; and the earth was illuminated by his splendour.
066	REV	018	002	With a mighty voice he cried – ‘She has fallen! She has fallen – Babylon the Great! She has become an abode of demons, a stronghold of every wicked spirit, a stronghold of every foul and hateful bird.
066	REV	018	003	For, after drinking the maddening wine of her licentiousness, all the nations have fallen; while all the kings of the earth have had licentious intercourse with her, and the merchants of the earth have grown rich through the excess of her luxury.’
066	REV	018	004	Then I heard another voice from heaven saying – ‘Come out of her, my people, so that you may not participate in her sins, and that you may not suffer from the curses inflicted on her.
066	REV	018	005	For her sins are heaped up to the heavens, and God has not forgotten her misdeeds.
066	REV	018	006	Pay her back the treatment with which she has treated you; yes, repay twice over what her actions deserve; in the cup which she mixed for you, mix for her as much again;
066	REV	018	007	for her self-glorification and her luxury, give her now an equal measure of torture and misery. In her heart she says “I sit here a queen; no widow am I; I will never know misery.”
066	REV	018	008	Therefore in one day will these curses strike her – death, misery, and famine, and she will be utterly consumed by fire; for mighty is the Lord God who condemned her.’
066	REV	018	009	All the kings of the earth who had licentious intercourse with her and shared her luxury will weep and lament over her, when they see the smoke from the burning city,
066	REV	018	010	while they stand at a distance, horrified at her torture, and cry – ‘Alas! Alas! Great city! Mighty city of Babylon! In a single hour your judgment fell.’
066	REV	018	011	And the merchants of the earth weep and wail over her, because no longer does anyone buy their cargoes –
066	REV	018	012	their cargoes of gold, or silver, or precious stones, or pearls, or fine linen, or purple robes, or silk, or scarlet cloth; nor their many scented woods; nor their many articles of ivory; nor their many articles of choicest wood, or brass, or iron, or marble;
066	REV	018	013	nor their cinnamon, or spice, or incense, or perfumes, or frankincense, or wine, or oil, or fine flour, or wheat, or cattle, or sheep; nor their horses, or chariots, or slaves; nor the bodies and souls of people.
066	REV	018	014	The fruit that your soul craved is no longer within your reach, and all dainties and luxuries are lost to you, never to be found again.
066	REV	018	015	The merchants who sold these things, and grew rich by her, will stand at a distance weeping and wailing, horrified at her torture, and crying –
066	REV	018	016	‘Alas! Alas! Great city! City clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet cloth! City adorned with gold ornaments, and precious stones, and pearls!
066	REV	018	017	In a single hour your vast wealth vanished.’ Every ship’s captain and all who sail to any port, and sailors, and all who get their living from the sea, stood at a distance,
066	REV	018	018	and seeing the smoke from the burning city, cried – ‘What city can compare with the Great city?’
066	REV	018	019	They threw dust on their heads, and, as they wept and wailed, they cried – ‘Alas! Alas! Great city! All who have ships on the sea grew rich through her magnificence. In a single hour it has vanished.’
066	REV	018	020	Rejoice over her, heaven, and people of Christ, and apostles, and prophets, for God has avenged you on her!
066	REV	018	021	Then a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and threw it into the sea, crying – ‘So will Babylon, the great city, be violently overthrown, never more to be seen.
066	REV	018	022	No more will the music of harpers, or minstrels, or flute players, or trumpeters be heard in you, no more will any worker, skilled in any art, be found in you; no more will the sound of a mill be heard in you;
066	REV	018	023	no more will the light of a lamp shine in you; no more will the voices of groom and bride be heard in you. Your merchants were the great men of the earth, for all the nations were deceived by your magical charms.’
066	REV	018	024	Yes, and in her was to be found the blood of the prophets and of Christ’s people, and of all who have been put to death on the earth.
066	REV	019	001	After this, I heard what seemed to be a great shout from a vast throng in heaven, crying – “Hallelujah! To our God belong salvation, and glory, and Power,
066	REV	019	002	for true and righteous are his judgments. For he has passed judgment on the infamous prostitute who was corrupting the earth by her licentiousness, and he has taken vengeance on her for the blood of his servants.”
066	REV	019	003	Again they cried – “Hallelujah!” And the smoke from her ruins rises for ever and ever.
066	REV	019	004	Then the twenty-four elders and the Four creatures prostrated themselves and worshiped God who was seated on the throne, crying – “Amen, Hallelujah!”;
066	REV	019	005	and from the throne there came a voice which said – “Praise our God all you who serve him, You who worship him, both high and low.”
066	REV	019	006	Then I heard what seemed to be the shout of a vast throng, like the sound of many waters, and like the sound of loud peals of thunder, crying – “Hallelujah! For the Lord is king, our God, the Almighty.
066	REV	019	007	Let us rejoice and exalt; and we will pay him honour, for the hour for the Marriage of the Lamb has come, and his Bride has made herself ready.
066	REV	019	008	And to her it has been granted to robe herself in fine linen, white and pure, for that linen is the good deeds of the people of Christ.”
066	REV	019	009	Then a voice said to me “Write – ‘Blessed are those who have been summoned to the marriage feast of the Lamb.’” And the voice said – “These words of God are true.”
066	REV	019	010	I prostrated myself at the feet of him who spoke to worship him, but he said to me – “No! I am your fellow servant, and the fellow servant of your brothers and sisters who bear their testimony to Jesus. Worship God. For to bear testimony to Jesus needs the inspiration of the prophets.”
066	REV	019	011	Then I saw that heaven lay open. There appears a white horse; its rider is called “Faithful” and “True”; righteously does he judge and make war.
066	REV	019	012	His eyes are flaming fires; on his head there are many diadems, and he bears a name, written, which no one knows but himself;
066	REV	019	013	he has been clothed in a garment sprinkled with blood; and the name by which he is called is “The Word of God.”
066	REV	019	014	The armies of heaven followed him, mounted on white horses and clothed in fine linen, white and pure.
066	REV	019	015	From his mouth comes a sharp sword, with which to smite the nations; and he will rule them with an iron rod. He treads the grapes in the press of the maddening wine of the wrath of Almighty God;
066	REV	019	016	and on his robe and on his thigh he has this name written – “KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS.”
066	REV	019	017	Then I saw an angel standing on the sun. He cried in a loud voice to all the birds that fly in mid-heaven – “Gather and come to the great feast of God,
066	REV	019	018	to eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of commanders, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses and their riders, and the flesh of all free and enslaved, and of high and low.”
066	REV	019	019	Then I saw the Beast and the kings of the earth and their armies, gathered together to fight with him who sat on the horse and with his army.
066	REV	019	020	The Beast was captured, and with him was taken the false prophet, who performed the marvels before the eyes of the Beast, with which he deceived those who had received the brand of the Beast and those who worshiped his image. Alive, they were thrown, both of them, into the lake of fire – of burning sulphur.
066	REV	019	021	The rest were killed by the sword which came out of the mouth of him who rode on the horse; and all the birds fed on their flesh.
066	REV	020	001	Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, with the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.
066	REV	020	002	He seized the Dragon, the primeval snake (who is the “devil” or “Satan”), and bound him in chains for a thousand years.
066	REV	020	003	He flung him into the bottomless pit and locked it, and set his seal on it; that he should not deceive the nations any more, until the thousand years were ended. After that he must be let loose for a while.
066	REV	020	004	Then I saw thrones, and to those who took their seats on them authority was given to act as judges. And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of the testimony to Jesus and because of the message of God, for they had refused to worship the Beast or its image, and had not received the brand on their foreheads and on their hands. They were restored to life, and they reigned with the Christ for a thousand years.
066	REV	020	005	(The rest of the dead were not restored to life until the thousand years were ended.) This is the first resurrection.
066	REV	020	006	Blessed and holy will he be who shares in that first resurrection. The second Death has no power over them; but they will be priests of God, and the Christ, and they will reign with him for the thousand years.
066	REV	020	007	When the thousand years are ended, Satan will be let loose from his prison,
066	REV	020	008	and he will come out to deceive the nations that live in the four corners of the earth – Gog and Magog. He will come to gather them together for battle; and their number will be as great as the sand on the sea-shore.
066	REV	020	009	They went up over the breadth of the whole earth, and surrounded the camp of Christ’s people and the city that he loves. Then fire fell from the heavens and consumed them;
066	REV	020	010	and the devil, their deceiver, was hurled into the lake of fire and sulphur, where the Beast and the false prophet already were, and they will be tortured day and night for ever and ever.
066	REV	020	011	Then I saw a great white throne, and him who was seated on it. The earth and the heavens fled from his presence; no place was left for them.
066	REV	020	012	And I saw the dead, high and low, standing before the throne; and books were opened. Then another book was opened, the book of life; and the dead were judged, according to their actions, by what was written in the books.
066	REV	020	013	The sea gave up its dead, and Death and Hades gave up their dead; and they were judged, one by one, each according to his actions.
066	REV	020	014	Then Death and Hades were hurled into the lake of fire. This is the Second Death – the lake of fire;
066	REV	020	015	and all whose names were not found written in the book of life were hurled into the lake of fire.
066	REV	021	001	Then I saw new heavens and a new earth. The former heavens and the former earth had passed away; and the sea has ceased to be.
066	REV	021	002	And I saw the Holy City, Jerusalem, descending new out of heaven from God, like a bride adorned in readiness for her husband.
066	REV	021	003	And I heard a loud voice from the throne, which said – “See! The tent of God is set up among people. God will live among them, and they will be his Peoples, and God himself will be among them,
066	REV	021	004	and he will wipe away all tears from their eyes. There will be no more death, nor will there be any more grief or crying or pain. The old order has passed away.”
066	REV	021	005	And he who was seated on the throne said – “See, I make all things new!” And he said – “Write this, for these words may be trusted and are true.”
066	REV	021	006	And he said to me – “They are fulfilled. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the End. To those who thirst I will give of the spring of the water of life, freely.
066	REV	021	007	Those who conquer will enter into possession of these things, and I will be their God, and they will be my children.
066	REV	021	008	But as for cowards, unbelievers, the degraded, murderers, the impure, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars – their place will be in the burning lake of fire and sulphur. That is the Second Death.”
066	REV	021	009	Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls, and were laden with the seven last curses, came and spoke to me. “Come here,” he said, “and I will show you the Bride, the Wife of the Lamb.”
066	REV	021	010	He carried me away in a trance to a great high mountain, and showed me Jerusalem, the Holy City, descending out of heaven from God, filled with the glory of God.
066	REV	021	011	Its brilliance was like a precious stone, like a jasper, transparent as crystal.
066	REV	021	012	It had a great high wall, in which were twelve gates; and at these gates there were twelve angels, and there were names inscribed on the gates, the names of the twelve tribes of the Israelites.
066	REV	021	013	There were three gates on the east, three gates on the north, three gates on the south, and three gates on the west.
066	REV	021	014	The wall of the city had twelve foundation stones, on which were the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
066	REV	021	015	And the angel who was speaking to me had as a measure a gold rod, with which to measure the city and its gates and its wall.
066	REV	021	016	The city is square; the length and the breadth are the same. The angel measured with his rod; it was twelve hundred miles; its length, and breadth, and height are equal.
066	REV	021	017	Then he measured the wall; it was two hundred and eighty-eight feet, as people measure, that is as the angel measured.
066	REV	021	018	The material of the wall of the city was jasper, and the city was built of pure gold, which shone like clear glass.
066	REV	021	019	The foundations of the wall of the city were ornamented with every kind of precious stone. The first foundation stone was a jasper; the second a sapphire; the third a chalcedony; the fourth an emerald;
066	REV	021	020	the fifth a sardonyx; the sixth a carnelian; the seventh a chrysolite; the eighth a beryl; the ninth a topaz; the tenth a chrysoprase; the eleventh a hyacinth; and the twelfth an amethyst.
066	REV	021	021	The twelve gates were made of twelve pearls, each gate of one pearl. The street of the city was of pure gold, transparent as glass.
066	REV	021	022	And I saw no Temple there, for the Lord, our God, the Almighty, and the Lamb are its Temple.
066	REV	021	023	The city has no need of the sun or the moon to shine on it, for the glory of God illuminated it, and its Lamp was the Lamb.
066	REV	021	024	The nations walk by the light of it; and the kings of the earth bring their glory into it.
066	REV	021	025	Its gates will never be shut by day, and there will be no night there.
066	REV	021	026	And people will bring the glory and honour of the nations into it.
066	REV	021	027	Never will any unhallowed thing enter it, nor they whose life is shameful and false, but only those whose names have been written in the Lamb’s book of life.
066	REV	022	001	And the angel showed me a river of the water of life, as clear as crystal, issuing from the throne of God and of the Lamb,
066	REV	022	002	in the middle of the street of the city. On each side of the river was a Tree of life which bore twelve kinds of fruit, yielding its fruit each month; and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.
066	REV	022	003	Every thing that is accursed will cease to be. The throne of God and of the Lamb will be within it, and his servants will worship him;
066	REV	022	004	they will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads.
066	REV	022	005	Night will cease to be. They have no need of the light of a lamp, nor have they the light of the sun; for the Lord God will be their light, and they will reign for ever and ever.
066	REV	022	006	Then the angel said to me – ‘These words may be trusted and are true. The Lord, the God that inspires the prophets, sent his angel to show his servants what must quickly take place;
066	REV	022	007	and they said “I will come quickly.” Blessed will he be who lays to heart the words of the prophecy contained in this book.’
066	REV	022	008	It was I, John, who heard and saw these things; and, when I heard and saw them, I prostrated myself in worship at the feet of the angel that showed them to me.
066	REV	022	009	But he said to me – ‘Forbear; I am your fellow servant, and the fellow servant of your fellow prophets, and of all who lay to heart the words in this book. Worship God.’
066	REV	022	010	Then the angel said to me – ‘Do not keep secret the words of the prophecy contained in this book; for the time is near.
066	REV	022	011	Let the wrongdoer continue to do wrong; the filthy-minded continue to be filthy; the righteous continue to act righteously; and the holy-minded continue to be holy.’
066	REV	022	012	(“I will come quickly. I bring my rewards with me, to give to each what their actions deserve.
066	REV	022	013	I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the beginning and the End.”)
066	REV	022	014	Blessed will they be who wash their robes! They will have the right to approach the Tree of life, and may enter the city by the gates.
066	REV	022	015	Outside will be the filthy, the sorcerers, the impure, the murderers, the idolaters, and all who love the false and live it.
066	REV	022	016	“I, Jesus, sent my angel to bear testimony to you about these things before the churches. I am the Scion and the Offspring of David, the bright star of the Morning.”
066	REV	022	017	“Come,” say the Spirit and the Bride; and all who hear, say “Come.” All who thirst, come; anyone who wants, take the water of life freely.
066	REV	022	018	I declare to all who hear the words of the prophecy contained in this book – “If anyone adds to it, God will add to his troubles the curses described in this book;
066	REV	022	019	and if anyone takes away any of the words in the book containing this prophecy, God will take away his share in the Tree of life, and in the Holy City – as described in this book.”
066	REV	022	020	He whose testimony this is says – “Assuredly I will come quickly.” “Amen, come, Lord Jesus.”
066	REV	022	021	May the blessing of the Lord Jesus Christ, be with his people.
