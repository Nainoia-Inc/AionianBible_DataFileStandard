# BOOK	040	MAT	Matthew	Matthew
040	MAT	001	001	The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.
040	MAT	001	002	Abraham begot Isaac: Isaac begot Jacob: Jacob begot Judah and his brothers:
040	MAT	001	003	Judah begot Phares and Zarah of Thamar: Phares begot Hezron: Hezron begot Aram:
040	MAT	001	004	Aram begot Aminidab: Aminidab begot Nahshon: Nahshon begot Salmon:
040	MAT	001	005	Salmon begot Boa of Rachab: Boaz begot Obed of Ruth: Obed begot Jesse:
040	MAT	001	006	Jesse begot David the king: David the king begot Solomon of her who had been the wife of Uriah:
040	MAT	001	007	Solomon begot Rehoboam: Rehoboam begot Abia: Abia begot Asa:
040	MAT	001	008	Asa begot Jehosaphat: Jehosaphat begot Jehoram: Jehoram begot Uzziah:
040	MAT	001	009	Uzziah begot Jotham: Jotham begot Ahaz: Ahaz begot Hezekiah:
040	MAT	001	010	Hezekiah begot Manasseh: Manasseh begot Amon: Amon begot Josiah:
040	MAT	001	011	Josiah begot Jeconiah and his brothers, about the time of the removal to Babylon.
040	MAT	001	012	And after the removal to Babylon, Jeconiah begot Shealtiel: Shealtiel begot Zerubbabel:
040	MAT	001	013	Zerubbabel begot Abiud: Abiud begot Eliakim: Eliakim begot Azor:
040	MAT	001	014	Azor begot Sadok: Sadok begot Achim: Achim begot Eliud:
040	MAT	001	015	Eliud begot Eleazar: Eleazar begot Matthan: Matthan begot Jacob:
040	MAT	001	016	Jacob begot Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.
040	MAT	001	017	So all the generations from Abraham till David are fourteen generations: and from David till the removal to Babylon are fourteen generations: and from the removal to Babylon till the Christ are fourteen generations.
040	MAT	001	018	But Jesus Christ was begotten thus: After his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they had come together, she was found to be with child of the Holy Spirit.
040	MAT	001	019	Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not choosing to make an example of her, intended to put her away privately.
040	MAT	001	020	But while he was thinking of these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying: Joseph, son of David, fear not to take home Mary your wife; for that which is begotten in her is of the Holy Spirit.
040	MAT	001	021	And she will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus; for he will save his people from their sins.
040	MAT	001	022	Now all this was done, that the word might be fulfilled, which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying:
040	MAT	001	023	Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bear a son, and his name shall be called Immanuel, which, when translated, is, God with us.
040	MAT	001	024	And Joseph awoke from his sleep, and did as the angel of the Lord had commanded him; and he took home his wife,
040	MAT	001	025	and knew her not till she had brought forth her first-born son. And he called his name Jesus.
040	MAT	002	001	Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, in the days of Herod the king, behold, Magi from the east came to Jerusalem,
040	MAT	002	002	saying: Where is he that is born king of the Jews? For we have seen his star in the east, and have come to do him homage.
040	MAT	002	003	When Herod the king heard these things, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.
040	MAT	002	004	And when he had assembled all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Christ should be born.
040	MAT	002	005	And they said to him: In Bethlehem of Judea; for thus it is written by the prophet:
040	MAT	002	006	And thou, Bethlehem, city of Judah, art by no means the least among the chiefs of Judah; for out of thee shall come a leader, that shall be a shepherd to my people Israel.
040	MAT	002	007	Then Herod, when he had secretly called the Magi, inquired of them strictly at what time the star, then visible, first made its appearance:
040	MAT	002	008	and sending them to Bethlehem, he said: Go, make strict inquiry for the young child: and when you have found him, bring me word, that I also may go and do him homage.
040	MAT	002	009	When they had heard the king, they departed; and lo, the star, which they had seen in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over the place where the young child was.
040	MAT	002	010	And when they saw the star, they rejoiced with very great joy.
040	MAT	002	011	And having come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother; and falling down, they did him homage. And when they had opened their treasures, they offered to him gifts, gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
040	MAT	002	012	And having been warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed into their own country by another way.
040	MAT	002	013	When they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying: Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be there till I bring you word; for Herod is about to seek for the young child, to destroy him.
040	MAT	002	014	And he arose and took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt,
040	MAT	002	015	and was there till the death of Herod; that the word might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through his prophet, saying: Out of Egypt have I called my Son.
040	MAT	002	016	Then Herod, when he saw that he was deceived by the Magi, was greatly enraged, and sent out and slew all the male children that were in Bethlehem and in all its borders, from the age of two years and under, according to the time which he had strictly inquired of the Magi.
040	MAT	002	017	Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying:
040	MAT	002	018	A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and weeping, and great mourning; Rachel weeping for her children, and refusing to be comforted because they are no more.
040	MAT	002	019	But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,
040	MAT	002	020	saying: Arise and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel; for they are dead who sought the young child’s life.
040	MAT	002	021	And he arose and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.
040	MAT	002	022	But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning in Judea in place of Herod his father, he was afraid to go thither. But being warned in a dream, he withdrew into the regions of Galilee,
040	MAT	002	023	and came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth, that the word might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets: He shall be called a Nazarene.
040	MAT	003	001	In those days came John the Immerser, preaching in the wilderness of Judea,
040	MAT	003	002	and saying: Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
040	MAT	003	003	For this is he that was spoken of by Isaiah the prophet, saying: The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.
040	MAT	003	004	But the same John had his clothing of camel’s hair, and a girdle of leather around his loins, and his food was locusts and wild honey.
040	MAT	003	005	Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all the region round about the Jordan,
040	MAT	003	006	and were immersed by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins.
040	MAT	003	007	But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his immersion, he said to them: Generation of vipers, who has warned you to flee from the coining wrath?
040	MAT	003	008	Bring forth, therefore, fruit worthy of repentance:
040	MAT	003	009	and think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham for our father; for I say to you that God is able from these stones to raise up children to Abraham.
040	MAT	003	010	Even now the ax is lying at the root of the trees: therefore, every tree that does not bring forth good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
040	MAT	003	011	I immerse you in water, in order to repentance; but he that comes after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will immerse you in the Holy Spirit and in fire:
040	MAT	003	012	whose winnowing-shovel is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his thrashing-floor, and gather his grain into his granary; but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.
040	MAT	003	013	Then came Jesus from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be immersed by him.
040	MAT	003	014	But John forbade him, saying: I have need to be immersed by thee, and comest thou to me?
040	MAT	003	015	But Jesus answering said to him: Permit it now; for thus it becomes us to perform fully every righteous act. Then he permitted him.
040	MAT	003	016	And after Jesus was immersed, he came up immediately from the water; and lo, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and coming upon him.
040	MAT	003	017	And lo, a voice from heaven, saying: This is my beloved Son, in whom I delight.
040	MAT	004	001	Then was Jesus led up by the Spirit into the wilderness, to be tempted by the devil.
040	MAT	004	002	And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward hungry.
040	MAT	004	003	And the tempter came to him and said: If you are the Son of God, command that these stones become bread.
040	MAT	004	004	But he answered and said: It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes forth from the mouth of God.
040	MAT	004	005	Then the devil took him into the holy city, and placed him on the pinnacle of the temple,
040	MAT	004	006	and said to him: If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written: He will give his angels charge concerning you; and in their hands shall they take you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone.
040	MAT	004	007	Jesus said to him: It is again written, You shall not put the Lord your God to the proof.
040	MAT	004	008	Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them,
040	MAT	004	009	and said to him: All these things will I give you, if you will fall down and worship me.
040	MAT	004	010	Then Jesus said to him: Get behind me, Satan, for it is written: You shall worship the Lord your God, and him only shall you serve.
040	MAT	004	011	Then the devil left him, and behold, angels came and ministered to him.
040	MAT	004	012	Now when Jesus heard that John was delivered up; he withdrew into Galilee;
040	MAT	004	013	and, leaving Nazareth, he went and dwelt in Capernaum, which is upon the sea, in the borders of Zebulon and Naphtali,
040	MAT	004	014	that the word might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying:
040	MAT	004	015	The land of Zebulon, and the land of Naphtali, toward the sea beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles;
040	MAT	004	016	the people that sat in darkness saw great light; and upon those who sat in the region and shadow of death light has risen.
040	MAT	004	017	From that time Jesus began to preach and to say: Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
040	MAT	004	018	And as he was walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, throwing a net into the sea, for they were fishers.
040	MAT	004	019	And he said to them: Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men.
040	MAT	004	020	And they immediately left their nets and followed him.
040	MAT	004	021	And going on thence, he saw other two brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them.
040	MAT	004	022	And they immediately left the ship and their father, and followed him.
040	MAT	004	023	And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and curing every disease, and every kind of sickness among the people.
040	MAT	004	024	And his fame went abroad into all Syria. And they brought to him all that were sick, those who were afflicted with various diseases and pains, and those who were possessed with demons, and lunatics, and paralytics; and he cured them.
040	MAT	004	025	And many multitudes followed him from Galilee, and Decapolis, and Jerusalem, and Judea, and from beyond the Jordan.
040	MAT	005	001	And seeing the multitudes, he went up into the mountain; and when he had sat down, his disciples came to him;
040	MAT	005	002	and he opened his mouth and taught them, saying:
040	MAT	005	003	Blessed are the poor in spirit; for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
040	MAT	005	004	Blessed are they that mourn; for they shall be comforted.
040	MAT	005	005	Blessed are the meek; for they shall inherit the earth.
040	MAT	005	006	Blessed are they that hunger and thirst for righteousness; for they shall be filled.
040	MAT	005	007	Blessed are the merciful; for they shall receive mercy.
040	MAT	005	008	Blessed are the pure in heart; for they shall see God.
040	MAT	005	009	Blessed are the peacemakers; for they shall be called sons of God.
040	MAT	005	010	Blessed are they that are persecuted on account of righteousness; for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
040	MAT	005	011	Blessed are you, when they shall reproach you, and persecute you, and say every evil thing against you, falsely, on my account.
040	MAT	005	012	Rejoice, and leap for joy; for great is your reward in heaven: for so did they persecute the prophets who were before you.
040	MAT	005	013	You are the salt of the earth: but if the salt has become tasteless, by what means shall it become salt again? It is then good for nothing but to be thrown out and trod upon by men.
040	MAT	005	014	You are the light of the world: a city that lies upon a mountain can not be hid:
040	MAT	005	015	neither do men light a lamp and place it under the measure, but on the lamp-stand, and it gives light to all that are in the house.
040	MAT	005	016	In this way let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.
040	MAT	005	017	Think not that I have come to make the law or the prophets of no effect. I have not come to make them of no effect, but to give them their full efficiency.
040	MAT	005	018	For verily I say to you, Till heaven and earth pass away, one yod or one point shall in no way pass from the law till all be fulfilled.
040	MAT	005	019	Whoever, therefore, shall make void one of the least of these commandments, and shall teach men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven. But whoever shall do and teach, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
040	MAT	005	020	For I say to you, That, unless your righteousness excel that of the scribes and Pharisees, you can by no means enter into the kingdom of heaven.
040	MAT	005	021	You have heard that it was said to the ancients: You shall not kill; and whoever shall kill, shall be liable to the sentence of the judges.
040	MAT	005	022	But I say to you, Whoever is angry with his brother without a cause, shall be liable to the sentence of the judges. And whoever shall say to his brother, Worthless fellow, shall be liable to the sentence of the Sanhedrin. But who ever shall say, Impious wretch, shall be in danger of hell-fire.
040	MAT	005	023	If, therefore, you bring your gift to the altar, and there remember that your brother has any thing against you,
040	MAT	005	024	leave your gift there before the altar, and go, first be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.
040	MAT	005	025	Come to an agreement with your opponent at law quickly, while you are on the road with him, lest your opponent at law deliver you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and you be thrown into prison.
040	MAT	005	026	Verily, I say to you, You shall by no means come out thence, till you have paid the last farthing.
040	MAT	005	027	You have heard that it was said: You shall not commit adultery.
040	MAT	005	028	But I say to you, Whoever looks upon a woman to cherish desire for her, has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
040	MAT	005	029	If, then, your right eye ensnare you, tear it out, and throw it from you; for it is profitable for you that one of your members should perish, and not that your whole body should be thrown into hell.
040	MAT	005	030	And if your right hand ensnare you, cut it off, and throw it from you; for it is profitable for you that one of your members should perish, and not that your whole body should be thrown into hell.
040	MAT	005	031	It has been said: Whoever will put away his wife, let him give her a bill of divorce.
040	MAT	005	032	But I say to you, Whoever shall put away his wife, unless on account of lewdness, causes her to commit adultery: and whoever marries her that is divorced, commits adultery.
040	MAT	005	033	Again, you have heard that it was said to the ancients: You shall not swear falsely, but shall pay to the Lord your vows.
040	MAT	005	034	But I say to you, Swear not at all: neither by heaven, for it is the throne of God;
040	MAT	005	035	nor by the earth, for it is his footstool; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King:
040	MAT	005	036	neither shall you swear by your head, for you can not make one hair white or black.
040	MAT	005	037	But let your word be, Yes, yes; No, no; for whatever is more than these is of the Evil One.
040	MAT	005	038	You have heard that it was said: An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.
040	MAT	005	039	But I say to you, Resist not the injurious. But whoever will smite you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also.
040	MAT	005	040	And to him that will go to law with you, and take away your coat, give your mantle also.
040	MAT	005	041	And whoever will compel you to go one mile, go with him two.
040	MAT	005	042	Give to him that asks of you; and from him that would borrow of you, turn not away.
040	MAT	005	043	You have heard that it was said: You shall love your neighbor, and hate your enemy.
040	MAT	005	044	But I say to you, Love your enemies: bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who insult you and persecute you:
040	MAT	005	045	that you may be the sons of your Father who is in heaven; for he makes his sun to rise upon the evil and the good, and causes it to rain on the just and on the unjust.
040	MAT	005	046	For if you love those who love you, what reward have you? Do not even the publicans the same?
040	MAT	005	047	And if you salute your brethren only, in what do you excel? Do not even the publicans so?
040	MAT	005	048	Be you therefore perfect, as your Father who is in heaven is perfect.
040	MAT	006	001	Beware of doing your charitable deeds before men, to be seen by them; otherwise you have no reward with your Father who is in heaven.
040	MAT	006	002	When, therefore, you do a charitable deed, do not cause a trumpet to be sounded before you, as the hypocrites do, in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may be glorified by men. Verily, I say to you, They have their reward.
040	MAT	006	003	But when you do a charitable deed, let not your left hand know what your right hand does;
040	MAT	006	004	that your charitable deeds may be in secret; and your Father, who sees in secret, himself will reward you openly.
040	MAT	006	005	And when you pray, you shall not be like the hypocrites; for they love to pray standing in the synagogues, and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen by men. Verily, I say to you, They have their reward.
040	MAT	006	006	But do you, when you pray, go into your closet, and when you have closed the door, pray to your Father who is in secret: and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly.
040	MAT	006	007	But when you pray, do not use vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they will be heard for their many words.
040	MAT	006	008	Be not, therefore, like them; for your Father knows what things you need before you ask him.
040	MAT	006	009	In this manner, therefore, pray you: Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
040	MAT	006	010	Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth, as it is done in heaven.
040	MAT	006	011	Give us this day the bread for our support.
040	MAT	006	012	And forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors.
040	MAT	006	013	And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the Evil One.
040	MAT	006	014	For if you forgive men their offenses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.
040	MAT	006	015	But if you forgive not men their offenses, neither will your Father forgive your offenses.
040	MAT	006	016	And when you fast, do not put on a sad countenance, as the hypocrites do; for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear to men to be fasting. Verily, I say to you, They have their reward.
040	MAT	006	017	But do you, when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face;
040	MAT	006	018	that you may not appear to men to be fasting, but to your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you.
040	MAT	006	019	Lay not up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and rust consume, and where thieves break through and steal.
040	MAT	006	020	But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust consumes, and where thieves do not break through, nor steal.
040	MAT	006	021	For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
040	MAT	006	022	The lamp of the body is the eye: if, therefore, your eye be sound, your whole body will be light:
040	MAT	006	023	But if your eye be diseased, your whole body will be dark. If therefore, the light that is in you is darkness, how great is that darkness!
040	MAT	006	024	No one can serve two masters: for he will either hate the one and love the other; or he will hold to the one, and neglect the other. You can not serve God and riches.
040	MAT	006	025	For this reason I say to you, Be not anxious for your life, what you shall eat, and what you shall drink; nor for your body, what you shall put on. Is not your life a greater gift than food, and your body than clothing?
040	MAT	006	026	Observe the birds of the air, that they neither sow, nor reap, nor gather into granaries. Yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much better than they?
040	MAT	006	027	Which of you, by his anxiety, can add one span to his life?
040	MAT	006	028	And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field how they grow: they toil not, nor do they spin.
040	MAT	006	029	But I say to you, That Solomon, in all his glory, was not clothed like one of these.
040	MAT	006	030	If then, God so clothes the herb of the field, which to-day is, and to-morrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?
040	MAT	006	031	Therefore, be not anxious, saying: What shall we eat? or, what shall we drink? or, with what shall we be clothed?
040	MAT	006	032	For after all these things do the Gentiles seek: for your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.
040	MAT	006	033	But seek first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness, and all these things shall be given to you in addition.
040	MAT	006	034	Therefore, be not anxious about the morrow, for the morrow will have anxieties of its own. Sufficient for the day is its own evil.
040	MAT	007	001	Judge not, that you may not be judged:
040	MAT	007	002	for with what judgment you judge, you shall be judged: and with what measure you measure, it shall be measured to you.
040	MAT	007	003	And why do you look at the splinter that is in your brother’s eye, but perceive not the beam that is in your own eye?
040	MAT	007	004	Or, how will you say to your brother, Let me pull out the splinter from your eye: and lo; a beam is in your own eye?
040	MAT	007	005	Hypocrite! first pull the beam out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to pull the splinter out of your brother’s eye.
040	MAT	007	006	Give not that which is holy to dogs, nor throw your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and tear you.
040	MAT	007	007	Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and you shall find; knock, and it shall be opened to you.
040	MAT	007	008	For every one that asks, receives; and he that seeks, finds; and to him that knocks, it shall be opened.
040	MAT	007	009	What man is there of you, of whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone?
040	MAT	007	010	And if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?
040	MAT	007	011	If then you, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him?
040	MAT	007	012	All things, therefore, whatever you would that men should do to you, even so do you to them: for this is the law and the prophets.
040	MAT	007	013	Enter in through the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leads to destruction; and many there are that go in through it.
040	MAT	007	014	How strait is the gate, and how narrow the way, that leads to life! and few there are that find it.
040	MAT	007	015	But beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but within are ravenous wolves.
040	MAT	007	016	By their fruits you will know them. Are grapes gathered from thorns, or figs from thistles?
040	MAT	007	017	So every good tree produces goodly fruit: but an unsound tree produces diseased fruit.
040	MAT	007	018	A good tree can not produce diseased fruit; nor can an unsound tree produce goodly fruit.
040	MAT	007	019	Every tree that does not produce goodly fruit, is cut down and thrown into the fire.
040	MAT	007	020	Therefore, by their fruits you shall know them.
040	MAT	007	021	Not every one that says to me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that does the will of my Father who is in heaven.
040	MAT	007	022	Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name, and in thy name cast out demons, and in thy name done many mighty works?
040	MAT	007	023	And then will I profess to them, I never knew you: depart from me, you that work iniquity.
040	MAT	007	024	Therefore, whoever hears these words of mine and does them, I will liken him to a wise man, who built his house on the rock:
040	MAT	007	025	and the rain descended, and the torrents came, and the winds blew, and they beat against that house, and it fell not: for it was founded on the rock.
040	MAT	007	026	And every one that hears these words of mine, and does them not, shall be likened to a foolish man, who built his house upon the sand.
040	MAT	007	027	And the rain descended, and the torrents came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house, and it fell: and great was its fall.
040	MAT	007	028	And it came to pass when Jesus had ended these words, that the multitudes were astonished at his teaching:
040	MAT	007	029	for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes.
040	MAT	008	001	And when he had come down from the mountain, many multitudes followed him.
040	MAT	008	002	And behold, a leper came and did him homage, saying: Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.
040	MAT	008	003	And Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, saying: I will; be clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.
040	MAT	008	004	And Jesus said to him: See that you tell no one. But go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.
040	MAT	008	005	And when he entered Capernaum, there came to him a centurion, beseeching him,
040	MAT	008	006	and saying: Lord, my servant lies in my house, palsied, fearfully afflicted.
040	MAT	008	007	And Jesus said to him: I will go and cure him.
040	MAT	008	008	And the centurion answering, said: Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldst come under my roof; but say in a word only, and my servant shall be restored to health.
040	MAT	008	009	For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me; and I say to this one, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and he does it.
040	MAT	008	010	And when Jesus heard it, he was filled with admiration, and said to those who followed him: Verily I say to you, not even in Israel have I found so great faith.
040	MAT	008	011	I also say to you, That many shall come from the east and the west, and shall recline with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven;
040	MAT	008	012	but the sons of the kingdom shall be cast into the darkness that is without. There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
040	MAT	008	013	And Jesus said to the centurion: Go, and as you have believed, so be it to you. And his servant was restored to health in that hour.
040	MAT	008	014	And when Jesus had come into Peter’s house, he saw his mother-in-law lying, and ill of a fever.
040	MAT	008	015	And he touched her hand, and the fever left her: and she arose and ministered to him.
040	MAT	008	016	When the evening had come, they brought to him many that were possessed with demons: and he cast out the spirits with his word, and cured all that were sick;
040	MAT	008	017	that the word might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying: He himself took our infirmities, and bore our diseases.
040	MAT	008	018	But when Jesus saw many multitudes about him, he gave orders to depart to the other side.
040	MAT	008	019	And a certain scribe came and said to him: Teacher, I will follow thee wherever thou goest.
040	MAT	008	020	And Jesus said to him: The foxes have dens, and the birds of the air have roosts; but the Son of man has not where to lay his head.
040	MAT	008	021	And another of his disciples said to him: Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father.
040	MAT	008	022	But Jesus said to him: Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead.
040	MAT	008	023	And when he had entered the ship, his disciples followed him.
040	MAT	008	024	And behold, there was a great tempest in the sea, so that the ship was covered by the waves: but he was asleep.
040	MAT	008	025	And his disciples came to him, and awoke him, saying: Lord, save us; we perish.
040	MAT	008	026	And he said to them: Why are you fearful, O you of little faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea: and there was a great calm.
040	MAT	008	027	But the men were astonished, and said: What man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him!
040	MAT	008	028	And when he had come to the opposite side, into the country of the Gadarenes, there met him two men, coming out of the tombs, possessed with demons, very fierce, so that no one could pass that way.
040	MAT	008	029	And behold, they cried out, saying: What have we to do with thee, Jesus, Son of God? Hast thou come hither to torment us before the time?
040	MAT	008	030	Now there was, at a distance from them, a herd of many swine, feeding.
040	MAT	008	031	And the demons besought him, saying: If thou cast us out, permit us to go away into the herd of swine.
040	MAT	008	032	And he said to them: Go. And when they had come out, they went away into the herd of swine. And behold, the whole herd of swine rushed down a steep place into the sea, and perished in the waters.
040	MAT	008	033	And those who fed them fled, and went into the city, and told every thing, and what had happened to those who had been possessed with the demons.
040	MAT	008	034	And, behold, all the city came out to meet Jesus. And when they saw him, they besought him to depart out of their borders.
040	MAT	009	001	And he entered the ship, and passed over, and came into his own city.
040	MAT	009	002	And behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy, lying on a bed. And Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the palsied man: Son, be of good courage; your sins are forgiven you.
040	MAT	009	003	And behold, some of the scribes said within themselves: This man talks impiously.
040	MAT	009	004	And Jesus, perceiving their thoughts, said: Why do evil thoughts arise in your hearts?
040	MAT	009	005	For, which is easier, to say, Your sins are forgiven; or to say, Arise, and walk?
040	MAT	009	006	But that you may know that the Son of man on earth has authority to forgive sins (then he said to the palsied man): Arise, take up your bed, and go to your house.
040	MAT	009	007	And he arose, and departed to his house.
040	MAT	009	008	And when the multitude saw it, they were astonished, and glorified God, who had given such authority to men.
040	MAT	009	009	And as Jesus passed by from that place, he saw a man named Matthew, sitting at the custom-house; and he said to him: Follow me. And he arose and followed him.
040	MAT	009	010	And it came to pass that, while Jesus was reclining at table in his house, behold, many publicans and sinners came and reclined at table with him and his disciples.
040	MAT	009	011	And when the Pharisees saw it, they said to his disciples: Why does your teacher eat with publicans and sinners?
040	MAT	009	012	When Jesus heard it, he said to them: Those who are in health have no need of a physician, but those who are sick.
040	MAT	009	013	But go and learn what this means: I desire mercy, and not sacrifice. For I came not to call righteous men, but sinners to repentance.
040	MAT	009	014	Then came to him the disciples of John, saying: Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples fast not?
040	MAT	009	015	And Jesus said to them: Can the sons of the bride-chamber mourn while the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then will they fast.
040	MAT	009	016	No one puts a patch of new cloth on an old garment; for that which is put in to fill it up, takes from the garment, and a worse rent is made.
040	MAT	009	017	Nor do men put new wine into old bottles; if so, the bottles burst, and the wine runs out, and the bottles are lost. But they put new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved.
040	MAT	009	018	While he was speaking these things to them, behold, a certain ruler came and did him homage, saying: My daughter is already dead; but come, lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live.
040	MAT	009	019	And Jesus and his disciples arose and followed him.
040	MAT	009	020	And behold, a woman that had been diseased with an issue of blood for twelve years, came behind him, and touched the fringe of his mantle.
040	MAT	009	021	For she said within herself: If I may only touch his mantle, I shall be saved.
040	MAT	009	022	But Jesus turned, and saw her, and said: Daughter, be of good courage; your faith has saved you. And the woman was saved from that hour.
040	MAT	009	023	And when Jesus came into the house of the ruler, and saw the minstrels and the multitude making lamentation,
040	MAT	009	024	he said to them: Depart; for the maid is not dead, but sleeps. And they derided him.
040	MAT	009	025	But when the multitude had been sent out, he went in, and took the maiden by the hand, and she arose.
040	MAT	009	026	And the fame of this went abroad in all that land.
040	MAT	009	027	And as Jesus was departing thence, two blind men followed him, crying out and saying: Son of David, have mercy on us.
040	MAT	009	028	And when he had entered the house, the blind men came to him. And Jesus said to them: Do you believe that I am able to do this? They said to him, Yes, Lord.
040	MAT	009	029	Then he touched their eyes, and said: According to your faith, be it to you.
040	MAT	009	030	And their eyes were opened; and Jesus strictly charged them, saying: See that no one know it,
040	MAT	009	031	But they went out and spread his fame abroad in all that land.
040	MAT	009	032	And as they were going out, behold, they brought to him a dumb man possessed with a demon.
040	MAT	009	033	And after the demon had been cast out, the dumb man spoke. And the multitudes were astonished, and said: Never was it seen thus in Israel.
040	MAT	009	034	But the Pharisees said: He casts out the demons by the prince of the demons.
040	MAT	009	035	And Jesus went through all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and curing every disease and every infirmity.
040	MAT	009	036	And when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion for them, because they were troubled and scattered as sheep that had no shepherd.
040	MAT	009	037	Then he said to his disciples: The harvest is abundant, but the laborers are few.
040	MAT	009	038	Therefore pray the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest.
040	MAT	010	001	And he called to him his twelve disciples, and gave them authority over unclean spirits, so that they might cast them out, and care every disease and every infirmity.
040	MAT	010	002	Now these are the names of the twelve apostles: the first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother;
040	MAT	010	003	Philip and Bartholomew, Thomas, and Matthew the publican; James the son of Alphæus, and Lebbæus, who was surnamed Thaddæus;
040	MAT	010	004	Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also delivered him up.
040	MAT	010	005	These twelve Jesus sent forth after he had charged them, saying: Go not into the road that leads to the Gentiles, and enter not a city of the Samaritans.
040	MAT	010	006	But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
040	MAT	010	007	And as you go, preach, saying: The kingdom of heaven is at hand.
040	MAT	010	008	Cure the sick, cleanse the lepers, cast out demons. Freely you have received, freely give.
040	MAT	010	009	Provide for yourselves neither gold, nor silver, nor brass, to put into your purses,
040	MAT	010	010	nor bag for your journey, nor two coats, nor sandals, nor staffs: for the laborer is worthy of his support.
040	MAT	010	011	Whatever city or village you enter, inquire who in it is worthy, and there make your home till you go away.
040	MAT	010	012	When you go into a house, salute it:
040	MAT	010	013	and if the house be worthy, your peace shall come upon it; but if it be not worthy, your peace shall return to you.
040	MAT	010	014	And whoever will not receive you, nor hear your words, when you go out of that house or that city, shake off the dust from your feet.
040	MAT	010	015	Verily I say to you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah, in the day of judgment, than for that city.
040	MAT	010	016	Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be, therefore, wise as serpents, and guileless as doves.
040	MAT	010	017	But beware of men: for they will deliver you to the councils, and scourge you in their synagogues;
040	MAT	010	018	and you will be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles.
040	MAT	010	019	But when they deliver you up, be not anxious how or what you shall speak; for that which you shall speak shall be given you in that hour:
040	MAT	010	020	for it is not you that speak, but it is the Spirit of your Father that speaks in you.
040	MAT	010	021	Brother will deliver up brother to death, and the father the child; and children will rise up against their parents, and cause them to be put to death.
040	MAT	010	022	And you will be hated by all men on my account: but he that endures to the end shall be saved.
040	MAT	010	023	But when they persecute you in this city, flee into another: for verily I say to you, You will not have made the circuit of the cities of Israel before the Son of man shall come.
040	MAT	010	024	The disciple is not above his teacher, nor the servant above his master.
040	MAT	010	025	It is enough for the disciple, that he be as his teacher; and for the servant, that he be as his master. If they call the master of the house Beelzebul, how much more those of his household?
040	MAT	010	026	Fear them not, therefore; for there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed, nor hidden that shall not be made known.
040	MAT	010	027	What I tell you in darkness, speak in the light: and what you hear in the ear, preach on the house-tops.
040	MAT	010	028	And fear not them that kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul. But rather fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.
040	MAT	010	029	Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and yet not one of them shall fall upon the ground with out your Father.
040	MAT	010	030	But even the hairs of your head are all numbered.
040	MAT	010	031	Fear not, therefore: you are of more value than many sparrows.
040	MAT	010	032	Whoever, therefore, will confess me before men, him will I also confess before my Father who is in heaven.
040	MAT	010	033	But whoever will deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father who is in heaven.
040	MAT	010	034	Think not that I have come to send peace on the earth. I have not come to send peace, but a sword.
040	MAT	010	035	For I have come to set a man at variance with his father, and the daughter with her mother, and the daughter-in-law with her mother-in-law:
040	MAT	010	036	and a man’s enemies shall be those of his own household.
040	MAT	010	037	He that loves father or mother more than me, is not worthy of me: and he that loves son or daughter more than me, is not worthy of me:
040	MAT	010	038	and whoever does not take his cross and follow after me, is not worthy of me.
040	MAT	010	039	He that finds his life shall lose it; and he that loses his life for my sake, shall find it.
040	MAT	010	040	He that receives you, receives me: and he that receives me, receives him that sent me.
040	MAT	010	041	He that receives a prophet because he is a prophet, shall receive a prophet’s reward: and he that receives a righteous man because he is a righteous man, shall receive a righteous man’s reward.
040	MAT	010	042	And whoever will give one of these little ones only a cup of cold water to drink, because he is a disciple, verily I say to you, he shall not lose his reward.
040	MAT	011	001	And it came to pass, when Jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities.
040	MAT	011	002	Now when John had heard in the prison of the works of the Christ, he sent two of his disciples,
040	MAT	011	003	and said to him: Art thou he that was to come, or must we look for another?
040	MAT	011	004	And Jesus answered and said to them: Go and tell John what you hear and see.
040	MAT	011	005	The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk; the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear; the dead are raised, and the poor have the gospel preached to them;
040	MAT	011	006	and blessed is he that shall find in me no cause of offense.
040	MAT	011	007	As these were going away, Jesus began to say to the multitudes concerning John: What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?
040	MAT	011	008	But what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, those who wear soft clothing are in kings houses.
040	MAT	011	009	But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I say to you, and more than a prophet.
040	MAT	011	010	For this is he of whom it is written: Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee.
040	MAT	011	011	Verily, I say to you, Among those born of women, there has not risen a greater than John the Immerser. But the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
040	MAT	011	012	From the days of John the Immerser till now, the kingdom of heaven is taken by violence, and men of violence seize upon it eagerly.
040	MAT	011	013	For all the prophets and the law prophesied till John;
040	MAT	011	014	and if you are willing to receive it, he is Elijah that was to come.
040	MAT	011	015	He that has ears to hear, let him hear.
040	MAT	011	016	But to what shall I liken this generation? It is like children sitting in the markets, and calling to their companions,
040	MAT	011	017	and saying: We have played on the pipe for you, and you have not danced; we have wailed for you, and you have not lamented.
040	MAT	011	018	For John came, neither eating nor drinking, and they say: He has a demon.
040	MAT	011	019	The Son of man has come eating and drinking, and they say: Behold, a glutton, and a drinker of wine, a friend of publicans and sinners. Yet wisdom is vindicated by her children.
040	MAT	011	020	Then he began to reprove the cities in which most of his mighty works had been done, because they did not repent.
040	MAT	011	021	Alas for thee, Chorazin! alas for thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works which have been clone in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
040	MAT	011	022	But I say to you, It will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon, in the day of judgment, than for you.
040	MAT	011	023	And thou, Capernaum, that hast been exalted to heaven, shalt be brought down to hades. For if the mighty works which have been done in thee had been done in Sodom, it would have remained till this day.
040	MAT	011	024	But I say to you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom, in the day of judgment, than for thee.
040	MAT	011	025	At that time Jesus answered and said: I thank thee, Father, Lord of heaven and of earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to babes.
040	MAT	011	026	Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight.
040	MAT	011	027	All things have been delivered to me by my Father; and no one knows the Son, but the Father; nor does any one know the Father, but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him.
040	MAT	011	028	Come to me, all you that are weary, and heavily burdened, and I will give you rest.
040	MAT	011	029	Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me; for I am meek and lowly in heart; and you shall find rest for your souls.
040	MAT	011	030	For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.
040	MAT	012	001	At that time Jesus was going, on the Sabbath, through the fields of grain; and his disciples were hungry, and began to pull the ears of grain, and to eat.
040	MAT	012	002	But when the Pharisees saw it, they said to him: Behold, your disciples are doing what it is not lawful to do on the Sabbath.
040	MAT	012	003	But he said to them: Have you not read what David did, when he and those who were with him were hungry?
040	MAT	012	004	how he entered the house of God, and ate the loaves of the presence, which it was not lawful for him to eat, nor for those who were with him, but for the priests only?
040	MAT	012	005	Or, have you not read in the law that on the Sabbath-days the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath, and are blameless?
040	MAT	012	006	But I say to you, that something greater than the temple is here.
040	MAT	012	007	But if you had known what this means―I desire mercy, and not sacrifice―you would not have condemned the blameless.
040	MAT	012	008	For the Son of man is Lord of the Sabbath.
040	MAT	012	009	And he departed thence, and went into their synagogue.
040	MAT	012	010	And behold, a man was there that had a withered hand. And they asked him, saying: Is it lawful to cure on the Sabbath-days? that they might accuse him.
040	MAT	012	011	And he said to them: What man shall there be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if this fall into a pit on the Sabbath-day, will he not lay hold on it and lift it out?
040	MAT	012	012	How much better, then, is a man than a sheep! So it is lawful to do well on the Sabbath-days.
040	MAT	012	013	Then he said to the man: Stretch forth your hand. And he stretched it forth; and it was restored to soundness, like the other.
040	MAT	012	014	But the Pharisees went out and took counsel against him, that they might destroy him.
040	MAT	012	015	But Jesus perceived it, and withdrew from that place. And many multitudes followed him, and he cured them all.
040	MAT	012	016	And he charged them not to make him known;
040	MAT	012	017	that the word might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying:
040	MAT	012	018	Be hold, my servant whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul delights. I will put my Spirit upon him, and he shall declare law to the Gentiles.
040	MAT	012	019	He shall not contend, nor cry out; nor shall any one hear his voice in the streets.
040	MAT	012	020	A bruised reed he shall not break, and a smoking wick he shall not extinguish, till he shall send forth his law for conquest.
040	MAT	012	021	And in his name shall the Gentiles trust.
040	MAT	012	022	Then was brought to him a demoniac, blind and dumb: and he cured him, so that the blind and dumb man both spoke and saw.
040	MAT	012	023	And all the people were amazed, and said: Is not this the son of David?
040	MAT	012	024	But the Pharisees, when they heard it, said: This man does not cast out the demons, unless by Beelzebul, the prince of the demons.
040	MAT	012	025	But Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said to them: Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation. And no city or house divided against itself shall stand.
040	MAT	012	026	And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself; how then shall his kingdom stand?
040	MAT	012	027	And if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons cast them out? For this reason, they shall be your judges.
040	MAT	012	028	But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has already come upon you.
040	MAT	012	029	Or, how can any one enter the house of the strong man and spoil his goods, unless he first bind the strong man? and then he will plunder his house.
040	MAT	012	030	He that is not with me, is against me; and he that gathers not with me, scatters.
040	MAT	012	031	Therefore I say to you, That every sin and impious speech shad be forgiven men: but the impious speech against the Spirit shall not be forgiven men.
040	MAT	012	032	And whoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whoever shall speak against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him, either in the present age, or in that which is to come.
040	MAT	012	033	Either make the tree good, and its fruit good; or make the tree unsound, and its fruit unsound. For by the fruit the tree is known.
040	MAT	012	034	Generation of vipers, how can you, being evil, speak good things? For out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks.
040	MAT	012	035	The good man, out of his good treasury, brings forth good things; and the evil man, out of his evil treasury, brings forth evil things.
040	MAT	012	036	But I say to you, That for every idle word which men speak, they shall give account in the day of judgment.
040	MAT	012	037	For by your words you shall be justified, and by your words you shall be condemned.
040	MAT	012	038	Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered and said: Teacher, we wish to see a sign from you.
040	MAT	012	039	But he answered and said to them: A wicked and adulterous generation seeks for a sign; and no sign shall be given to it, but the sign of Jonah the prophet.
040	MAT	012	040	For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
040	MAT	012	041	Tho men of Nineveh shall rise in the judgment with this generation, and condemn it; for they repented in accordance with the preaching of Jonah; and behold, something greater than Jonah is here.
040	MAT	012	042	The queen of the south shall rise in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it; for she came from the most distant parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, something greater than Solomon is here.
040	MAT	012	043	When the unclean spirit has gone out of a man, he goes through dry places seeking rest, and finds none.
040	MAT	012	044	Then he says: I will return to my house, out of which I came. And he comes and finds it empty, swept, and set in order.
040	MAT	012	045	Then he goes and takes with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself; and they enter in and dwell there. And the last state of that man is worse than the first. So shall it be with this wicked generation.
040	MAT	012	046	While he was yet speaking to the multitudes, behold, his mother and his brothers stood without, desiring to speak to him.
040	MAT	012	047	And some one said to him: Behold, your mother and your brothers stand without, desiring to speak to you.
040	MAT	012	048	But he answered and said to him that told him: Who is my mother? and who are my brothers?
040	MAT	012	049	And he stretched out his hand toward his disciples, and said: Behold my mother and my brothers.
040	MAT	012	050	For whoever will do the will of my Father who is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.
040	MAT	013	001	On that day Jesus went out of the house, and sat by the sea.
040	MAT	013	002	And many multitudes came together to him, so that he went into a ship and sat; and the whole multitude stood on the shore.
040	MAT	013	003	And he spoke many things to them in parables, saying: Behold, the sower went out to sow.
040	MAT	013	004	And as he sowed, some seeds fell by the way: and the birds came and ate them up.
040	MAT	013	005	Others fell on stony places, where they had not much earth; and they immediately sprung up, because they had no depth of earth.
040	MAT	013	006	But when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.
040	MAT	013	007	Others fell among thorns, and the thorns sprung up and choked them.
040	MAT	013	008	Others fell upon good ground, and brought forth fruit, some a hundred, some fifty, some thirty.
040	MAT	013	009	He that has ears to hear, let him hear.
040	MAT	013	010	And the disciples came and said to him: Why dost thou speak to them in parables?
040	MAT	013	011	He answered, and said to them: Because it is given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven; but to them it is not given.
040	MAT	013	012	For whoever has, to him shall be given, and he shall have abundance; but whoever has not, even that which he has shall be taken from him.
040	MAT	013	013	For this reason I speak to them in parables; because when they see, they see not; and when they hear, they hear not, nor do they understand.
040	MAT	013	014	And in them is fulfilled the prophesy of Isaiah, which says: You shall surely hear, and you will not understand; and you shall surely see, and you will not perceive.
040	MAT	013	015	For the heart of this people has become fat; and with their ears they hear heavily; and their eyes they have closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should turn to me, and I should give them health.
040	MAT	013	016	But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear.
040	MAT	013	017	For verily I say to you, Many prophets and righteous men desired to see what you see, and did not see; and to hear what you hear, and did not hear.
040	MAT	013	018	Hear you, therefore, the parable of the sower.
040	MAT	013	019	When any one hears the word of the kingdom, and understands it not, the wicked one comes and catches away that which was sown in his heart. This is he that received seed by the wayside.
040	MAT	013	020	He that received seed on the stony places is he that hears the word, and immediately receives it with joy.
040	MAT	013	021	Yet he has no root in himself, but endures for a while; and when affliction or persecution arises on account of the word, he immediately takes offense.
040	MAT	013	022	He that received seed among the thorns, is he that hears the word; and the cares of this age, and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.
040	MAT	013	023	But he that received seed on the good ground, is he that hears the word and understands it; who also produces fruit, and yields, one a hundred; another, sixty; another, thirty.
040	MAT	013	024	Another parable he laid before them, saying: The kingdom of heaven is likened to a man that sowed good seed in his field.
040	MAT	013	025	But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went away.
040	MAT	013	026	But when the blade sprung up, and produced fruit, then appeared the tares also.
040	MAT	013	027	And the servants of the master of the house came, and said to him, Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? Whence, then, has it tares?
040	MAT	013	028	He said to them, An enemy has done this. The servants said to him, Is it your will, then, that we go and gather them up?
040	MAT	013	029	But he said, No; lest while you are gathering the tares, you root up the wheat with them.
040	MAT	013	030	Let both grow together till the harvest, and in time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Collect first the tares, and bind them into bundles to burn them; but gather the wheat into my granary.
040	MAT	013	031	Another parable he laid before them, saying: The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard, that a man took and sowed in his field.
040	MAT	013	032	It is, indeed, the least of all seeds; but when it is grown it is the largest of garden-plants, and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and roost in its branches.
040	MAT	013	033	He spoke another parable to them: The kingdom of heaven is like leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of flour, till the whole was leavened.
040	MAT	013	034	All these things Jesus spoke to the multitudes in parables, and without a parable he did not speak to them;
040	MAT	013	035	that the word might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying: I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things that have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.
040	MAT	013	036	Then Jesus left the multitudes, and went into the house. And his disciples came to him and said: Explain to us the parable of the tares of the field.
040	MAT	013	037	He answered and said to them: He that sows the good seed is the Son of man;
040	MAT	013	038	the field is the world; the good seed are the sons of the kingdom; the tares are the sons of the Wicked One;
040	MAT	013	039	the enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the age; and the reapers are angels.
040	MAT	013	040	As, therefore, the tares are collected and burned in fire, so shall it be in the end of this age.
040	MAT	013	041	The Son of man will send forth his angels, and collect out of his kingdom all things that offend, and those who work iniquity,
040	MAT	013	042	and cast them into the furnace of fire; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
040	MAT	013	043	Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun, in the kingdom of their Father. He that has ears to hear, let him hear.
040	MAT	013	044	Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hid in a field, which, when a man finds it, he hides; and for the joy it gives, he goes and sells all that he has, and buys that field.
040	MAT	013	045	Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant seeking goodly pearls.
040	MAT	013	046	When he finds one pearl of great value, he goes and sells all that he has, and buys it.
040	MAT	013	047	Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that is cast into the sea, and that gathers of every kind:
040	MAT	013	048	when it is full, they draw it to the shore; and sitting down, they collect the good into vessels, but throw the bad away.
040	MAT	013	049	So shall it be in the end of the age: the angels shall come forth and separate the wicked from among the just,
040	MAT	013	050	and cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
040	MAT	013	051	Jesus said to them: Have you understood all these things? They said to him: Yes, Lord.
040	MAT	013	052	He said to them: Therefore, every scribe that is trained for the kingdom of heaven, is like the master of a house, who brings out of his treasury things new and old.
040	MAT	013	053	And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed from that place.
040	MAT	013	054	And he came into his own country, and taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said: Whence has this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?
040	MAT	013	055	Is not this the son of the carpenter? Is not his mother called Mary? and his brothers, James and Joses and Simon and Judas?
040	MAT	013	056	And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence, then, has this man all these things?
040	MAT	013	057	And they found in him occasion for offense. But Jesus said to them: A prophet is not without honor, unless it be in his own country and in his own house.
040	MAT	013	058	And he did not many mighty works there, on account of their unbelief.
040	MAT	014	001	At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus;
040	MAT	014	002	and he said to his servants: This is John The Immerser; he has risen from the dead; and for this reason the powers of the spiritual world are active within him.
040	MAT	014	003	For Herod had laid hold of John, and bound him, and put him in prison on account of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip.
040	MAT	014	004	For John said to him: It is not lawful for you to have her.
040	MAT	014	005	And he intended to put him to death, but feared the multitude, because they regarded him as a prophet.
040	MAT	014	006	But when Herod’s birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias danced in the midst, and pleased Herod.
040	MAT	014	007	Wherefore he promised, with an oath, to give her whatever she would ask.
040	MAT	014	008	And being previously instigated by her mother, she said: Give me here in a dish the head of John the Immerser?
040	MAT	014	009	And the king was grieved: but on account of his oath, and those who reclined at table with him, he commanded it to be given.
040	MAT	014	010	And he sent and beheaded John in the prison.
040	MAT	014	011	And his head was brought in a dish, and given to the maiden: and she carried it to her mother.
040	MAT	014	012	And his disciples came and took away the body, and buried it; and went and told Jesus.
040	MAT	014	013	And when Jesus heard of it, he withdrew from that place, by ship, into a desert place apart: and the multitudes, when they heard of his departure, followed him, on foot, from the cities.
040	MAT	014	014	And when Jesus came out, he saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion for them, and cured their sick.
040	MAT	014	015	And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, and said: This is a desert place, and the hour is now past; send the multitudes away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves food.
040	MAT	014	016	But Jesus said to them: They need not go away; do you give them food.
040	MAT	014	017	They said to him: We have here but five loaves and two fishes.
040	MAT	014	018	He said: Bring them hither to me.
040	MAT	014	019	And he commanded the multitudes to recline upon the grass: and he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looked up to heaven, and blessed, and broke, and gave the bread to the disciples, and the disciples gave it to the multitudes.
040	MAT	014	020	And they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up what remained of the broken pieces, twelve baskets full.
040	MAT	014	021	And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, besides women and children.
040	MAT	014	022	And he immediately constrained his disciples to get into the ship, and go before him to the opposite side, while he sent the multitudes away.
040	MAT	014	023	And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into the mountain apart to pray. And when evening came, he was there alone.
040	MAT	014	024	But the ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed by the waves, for the wind was against them.
040	MAT	014	025	And in the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea.
040	MAT	014	026	And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were alarmed, and said: It is a specter! and they cried out for fear.
040	MAT	014	027	But Jesus immediately spoke to them, and said: Take courage; it is I; be not afraid.
040	MAT	014	028	And Peter answered him, and said: Lord, if it be thou, bid me come to thee on the water.
040	MAT	014	029	And he said: Come. And Peter went down from the ship, and walked upon the water to go to Jesus.
040	MAT	014	030	But when he saw the wind strong, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried out, saying: Lord, save me.
040	MAT	014	031	And Jesus immediately stretched out his hand, and took hold of him, and said to him: O you of little faith, why did you doubt?
040	MAT	014	032	And when they had entered the ship, the wind ceased.
040	MAT	014	033	And they that were in the ship came and worshiped him, saying: Truly, thou art the Son of God.
040	MAT	014	034	And when they had passed over, they came into the land of Gennesaret.
040	MAT	014	035	And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent out into all the neighboring country, and brought to him all that were sick;
040	MAT	014	036	and besought him that they might only touch the fringe of his mantle; and as many as touched were perfectly saved.
040	MAT	015	001	Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees that were of Jerusalem, saying:
040	MAT	015	002	Why do your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they do not wash their hands when they eat bread.
040	MAT	015	003	But he answered and said to them: And why do you transgress the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition?
040	MAT	015	004	For God commanded, saying, Honor your father and your mother; and, He that curses father or mother shall surely be put to death.
040	MAT	015	005	But you say, Whoever shall say to his father or his mother, Whatever of mine might profit you, is a gift, he must in no way honor his father or his mother;
040	MAT	015	006	and you make the commandment of God of no effect for the sake of your tradition.
040	MAT	015	007	Hypocrites! well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying,
040	MAT	015	008	This people draws near to me with their mouth, and honors me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.
040	MAT	015	009	But in vain, do they worship me, teaching precepts, the commandments of men.
040	MAT	015	010	And he called the multitude to him, and said to them: Hear and understand;
040	MAT	015	011	That which enters the mouth does not defile the man; but that which comes out of the mouth, this defiles the man.
040	MAT	015	012	Then came his disciples and said to him: Dost thou know that the Pharisees, when they heard that saying, were offended?
040	MAT	015	013	But he answered and said: Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted, shall be rooted up.
040	MAT	015	014	Let them alone; they are blind leaders of the blind; and if the blind lead the blind, both will fall into the pit.
040	MAT	015	015	But Peter answered and said to him: Explain to us this dark saying.
040	MAT	015	016	Jesus replied: Are you also yet without understanding?
040	MAT	015	017	Do you not yet understand that whatever enters the mouth passes into the belly, and is cast out into the sink?
040	MAT	015	018	But those things which go out from the mouth, come from the heart; and these defile the man.
040	MAT	015	019	For from the heart come evil reasonings, murders, adulteries, lewd actions, thefts, false testimonies, impious words.
040	MAT	015	020	These are the things that defile the man. But to eat with unwashed hands does not defile the man.
040	MAT	015	021	And Jesus went out thence, and withdrew into the regions of Tyre and Sidon.
040	MAT	015	022	And behold, a woman of Chanaan came out from those borders, and cried to him, saying: Have mercy on me, Lord, son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a demon.
040	MAT	015	023	But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying: Send her away, for she cries after us.
040	MAT	015	024	But he answered and said: I am not sent but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
040	MAT	015	025	But she came and did him homage, saying: Lord, help me.
040	MAT	015	026	He answered and said: It is not good to take the children’s bread, and throw it to the little dogs.
040	MAT	015	027	She replied: Yes, Lord; and yet thou canst help me; for the little dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from the table of their masters.
040	MAT	015	028	Then Jesus answered and said to her: O woman, great is your faith; be it to you as you desire. And her daughter was restored to health from that hour.
040	MAT	015	029	And Jesus departed thence, and came near the sea of Galilee, and went up into the mountain, and sat there.
040	MAT	015	030	And many multitudes came to him, having with them the lame, the blind, the deaf, the maimed, and many others; and laid them at the feet of Jesus, and he cured them;
040	MAT	015	031	so that the multitudes were astonished, when they saw the dumb speaking, the maimed whole, the lame walking, and the blind seeing; and they glorified the God of Israel.
040	MAT	015	032	Then Jesus called his disciples to him, and said: I have compassion on the multitude, because they have been with me now three days, and have nothing to eat. And I am not willing to send them away fasting, lest they faint on the road.
040	MAT	015	033	And his disciples said to him: Whence should we have in the desert as many loaves as would satisfy so great a multitude?
040	MAT	015	034	And Jesus said to them: How many loaves have you? They said: Seven, and a few little fishes.
040	MAT	015	035	And he commanded the multitude to recline on the ground.
040	MAT	015	036	And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and broke, and gave thorn to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the multitude.
040	MAT	015	037	And they all ate and were satisfied; and they took up what remained of the broken pieces, seven baskets full.
040	MAT	015	038	And those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children.
040	MAT	015	039	And he sent the multitudes away, and entered the ship, and went into the borders of Magdala.
040	MAT	016	001	And the Pharisees and Sadducees came to tempt him, and asked him to show them a sign from heaven.
040	MAT	016	002	But he answered and said to them: When it is evening, you say, Fair weather; for the sky is red.
040	MAT	016	003	And in the morning, A storm to-day; for the sky is red and lowering. Hypocrites! you know how to judge of the face of the sky; but you can not judge of the signs of the times.
040	MAT	016	004	A wicked and adulterous generation seeks for a sign: and no sign shall be given it but the sign of Jonah the prophet. And he left them and departed.
040	MAT	016	005	And his disciples came to the other side, and had forgotten to take bread.
040	MAT	016	006	And Jesus said to them: Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
040	MAT	016	007	And they reasoned among themselves, saying: It is because we took no bread.
040	MAT	016	008	And Jesus perceiving it, said to them: O you of little faith! why are you reasoning among yourselves because you took no bread?
040	MAT	016	009	Do you not yet understand, nor remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets you took up?
040	MAT	016	010	Nor the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets you took up?
040	MAT	016	011	How is it that you do not understand, that I did not speak of bread when I commanded you to beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees?
040	MAT	016	012	Then they understood that he did not bid them beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.
040	MAT	016	013	When Jesus came into the regions of Cæsarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying: Who do men say that I, the Son of man, am?
040	MAT	016	014	They replied: Some say that thou art John the Immerser; others, Elijah; others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.
040	MAT	016	015	He said to them: But who say you that I am?
040	MAT	016	016	Simon Peter answered and said: Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.
040	MAT	016	017	And Jesus answered and said to him: Blessed are you, Simon, son of Jonah; for flesh and blood did not reveal this to you, but my Father who is in heaven.
040	MAT	016	018	And I say to you, That you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church: and the gates of hades shall not prevail against it.
040	MAT	016	019	And I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatever you shall bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven; and whatever you shall loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven.
040	MAT	016	020	Then he charged his disciples to tell no one that he was the Christ.
040	MAT	016	021	From that time Jesus began to tell his disciples plainly, that he must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders, and the chief priests, and the scribes, and be put to death, and be raised again the third day.
040	MAT	016	022	And Peter took him and began to rebuke him, saying: Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall not be to thee.
040	MAT	016	023	But he turned and said to Peter: Get behind me, adversary; you are a snare to me: for you are not thinking of the things of God; but of the things of men.
040	MAT	016	024	Then Jesus said to his disciples: If any one determines to come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.
040	MAT	016	025	For whoever will save his life, shall lose it. But whoever will lose his life for my sake, shall find it.
040	MAT	016	026	For what is a man profited, if he gain the whole world, but lose his own life? Or, what will a man give as the ransom of his life?
040	MAT	016	027	For the Son of man will come in the glory of his Father, with his angels; and then he will reward every one according to his deeds.
040	MAT	016	028	Verily I say to you, There are some standing here that shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.
040	MAT	017	001	And after six days, Jesus took with him Peter and James and John his brother, and led them up into a high mountain apart:
040	MAT	017	002	and he was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the sun, and his clothing was white as the light.
040	MAT	017	003	And behold, there appeared to them Moses and Elijah, talking with him.
040	MAT	017	004	And Peter answered and said to Jesus: Lord, it is good for us to be here; if thou wilt, let us make here three tents, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.
040	MAT	017	005	While he was yet speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them; and lo, a voice from the cloud, saying: This is my beloved Son, in whom I delight; hear him.
040	MAT	017	006	And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their faces, and were greatly afraid.
040	MAT	017	007	And Jesus came and touched them, and said: Arise and be not afraid.
040	MAT	017	008	And when they lifted up their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus.
040	MAT	017	009	And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying: Tell the vision to no one, till the Son of man has risen from the dead.
040	MAT	017	010	And his disciples asked him, saying: Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?
040	MAT	017	011	Jesus answered and said to them: Elijah, indeed, comes first, and he will restore all things.
040	MAT	017	012	But I say to you, That Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but did to him what they wished; so also shall the Son of man suffer at their hands.
040	MAT	017	013	Then, the disciples understood that he spoke to them of John the Immerser.
040	MAT	017	014	And when they had come to the multitude, there came to him a man who knelt to him,
040	MAT	017	015	and said: Lord, have mercy on my son; for he is a lunatic, and suffers grievously; for he often falls into the fire, and often into the water.
040	MAT	017	016	And I brought him to thy disciples, and they were not able to cure him.
040	MAT	017	017	Jesus answered and said: O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him hither to me.
040	MAT	017	018	And Jesus rebuked the demon, and he came out of him: and the child was cured from that hour.
040	MAT	017	019	Then the disciples came to Jesus privately, and said: Why were we not able to cast him out?
040	MAT	017	020	And Jesus said to them: Because of your unbelief. For verily I say to you, If you have faith like a grain of mustard-seed, you shall say to this mountain, Be removed from this place to that, and it shall be removed: and nothing shall be impossible for you.
040	MAT	017	021	But this kind does not go out but by prayer and fasting.
040	MAT	017	022	And as they were making their journey in Galilee, Jesus said to them: The Son of man is about to be delivered into the hands of men;
040	MAT	017	023	and they will kill him, and on the third day he will be raised again. And they were very sad.
040	MAT	017	024	And when they had come into Capernaum, those who collected the didrachma came to Peter, and said: Does not your teacher pay the didrachma?
040	MAT	017	025	He said: Yes. And when he had come into the house, before he had spoken, Jesus said to him: What think you, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth collect tax or tribute? From their own sons, or from the sons of others?
040	MAT	017	026	Peter said to him: From the sons of others. Jesus said to him: Then are their own sons free.
040	MAT	017	027	But that we may give them no offense, go to the sea, and throw in a hook, and take the fish that comes up first; and when you have opened his mouth, you will find a stater; take that, and give to them for me and you.
040	MAT	018	001	At that hour the disciples came to Jesus, and said: Who then is greatest in the kingdom of heaven?
040	MAT	018	002	And Jesus called a little child to him, and placed him in the midst of them,
040	MAT	018	003	and said: Verily I say to you, Unless you turn and become as little children, you can not enter the kingdom of heaven.
040	MAT	018	004	Whoever, therefore, humbles himself as this little child, is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
040	MAT	018	005	And whoever receives one such little child on my account, receives me;
040	MAT	018	006	but whoever ensnares one of these little ones that believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hung about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.
040	MAT	018	007	Alas for the world because of snares! for it is necessary that snares come: but alas for that man by whom the snare comes!
040	MAT	018	008	If, then, your hand or your foot ensnares you, cut it off, and throw it from you. It is better for you to enter into life lame or maimed, than, having two hands or two feet, to be thrown into the eternal fire.
040	MAT	018	009	And if your eye ensnares you, pull it out, and throw it from you. It is better to enter into life with one eye, than, having two eyes, to be thrown into hell-fire.
040	MAT	018	010	Take heed that you despise not one of these little ones: for I say to you, That their angels in heaven do always behold the face of my Father who is in heaven.
040	MAT	018	011	For the Son of man has come to save that which is lost.
040	MAT	018	012	What think you? If a man have a hundred sheep, and one of them go astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine, and go into the mountains, and seek for that which has gone astray?
040	MAT	018	013	And if it so be that he find it, verily I say to you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine that did not go astray.
040	MAT	018	014	Even so, it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven, that one of these little ones should be lost.
040	MAT	018	015	And if your brother sin against you, go and tell him of his fault between you and him alone; if he hear you, you have gained your brother.
040	MAT	018	016	But if he will not hear you, take with you one or two more, that, by the mouth of two or three witnesses, every word may be established.
040	MAT	018	017	But if he refuse to hear them, tell it to the church; and if he also refuse to hear the church, let him be to you as a heathen man and a publican.
040	MAT	018	018	Verily, I say to you, my disciples, Whatever you bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven; and whatever you loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven.
040	MAT	018	019	Again, I say to you, that if two of you agree on earth about any thing for which they will ask, it shall be done for them by my Father who is in heaven.
040	MAT	018	020	For where there are two or three that have come together for my sake, there I am in the midst of them.
040	MAT	018	021	Then Peter came to him, and said: Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Till seven times?
040	MAT	018	022	Jesus said to him: I say to you, Not till seven times, but till seventy times seven.
040	MAT	018	023	For this reason, the kingdom of heaven is likened to a king that wished to settle accounts with his servants.
040	MAT	018	024	And when he began to make a settlement, there was brought to him one that owed him ten thou sand talents.
040	MAT	018	025	But as he was not able to pay, his lord commanded him, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, to be sold, and payment to be made.
040	MAT	018	026	Therefore, the servant fell down and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, Lord, and I will pay you all.
040	MAT	018	027	And the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and let him go, and forgave him the debt.
040	MAT	018	028	But that servant went out, and found one of his fellow-servants, who owed him a hundred denarii; and he laid hold of him, and took him by the throat, saying: Pay me what you owe.
040	MAT	018	029	Then his fellow-servant fell down at his feet, and besought him, saying: Have patience with me, and I will pay you all.
040	MAT	018	030	And he would not; but went and threw him into prison, till he should pay the debt.
040	MAT	018	031	When his fellow-servants saw what was done, they were very sad, and went and made known to their lord all that was done.
040	MAT	018	032	Then his lord called him and said to him: Wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt, because you besought me.
040	MAT	018	033	Ought you not to have had mercy on your fellow-servant, even as I had mercy on you?
040	MAT	018	034	And his lord was angry, and delivered him to the jailers, till he should pay all that was due him.
040	MAT	018	035	So also will my heavenly Father do to you, if, from your hearts, you forgive not every one his brother’s offenses.
040	MAT	019	001	And it came to pass when Jesus had finished these discourses, that he departed from Galilee, and came into the borders of Judea, beyond the Jordan.
040	MAT	019	002	And many multitudes followed him; and he cured them there.
040	MAT	019	003	And the Pharisees came to him to tempt him, and said to him: Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?
040	MAT	019	004	He answered and said to them: Have you not read that the Creator, at the beginning, created them male and female,
040	MAT	019	005	and said, For this cause shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave to his wife, and the two shall be one flesh?
040	MAT	019	006	So then, they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore, what God has joined together, let not man put asunder.
040	MAT	019	007	They said to him: Why, then, did Moses command us to give a bill of divorce and put her away?
040	MAT	019	008	He said to them: Moses, on account of the hardness of your hearts, permitted you to put away your wives; but from the beginning it was not so.
040	MAT	019	009	But I say to you, That whoever puts away his wife, unless for lewdness, and marries another, commits adultery; and he that marries her that is put away, commits adultery.
040	MAT	019	010	His disciples said to him: If the relation of man and wife be such, it is not good to marry.
040	MAT	019	011	But he said to them: All can not accept this saying; only those to whom it is given.
040	MAT	019	012	For there are eunuchs that were born such from their mother’s womb; and there are eunuchs that have been made eunuchs by men; and there are eunuchs that have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let him accept it that is able to accept it.
040	MAT	019	013	Then little children were brought to him, that he might lay his hands on them and pray. And the disciples rebuked them.
040	MAT	019	014	But Jesus said: Let the little children come to me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.
040	MAT	019	015	And he laid his hands on them, and departed from that place.
040	MAT	019	016	And behold, one came and said to him: Good teacher, what good thing must I do that I may have eternal life? He said to him:
040	MAT	019	017	Why do you call me good? There is none good but one, that is God. But if you desire to enter into life, keep the commandments.
040	MAT	019	018	He said to him: Which? Jesus replied: You shall not kill; You shall not commit adultery; You shall not steal; You shall not give false testimony;
040	MAT	019	019	Honor your father and your mother; and, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.
040	MAT	019	020	The young man said to him: All these have I kept from my youth, what do I lack?
040	MAT	019	021	Jesus said to him: If you would be perfect, go, sell your possessions, and give to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.
040	MAT	019	022	When the young man heard that saying, he went away grieved; for he had great possessions.
040	MAT	019	023	Jesus said to his disciples: Verily I say to you, A rich man will with difficulty enter into the kingdom of heaven.
040	MAT	019	024	And again I say to you: It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
040	MAT	019	025	When the disciples heard it, they were greatly amazed, and said: Who, then, can be saved?
040	MAT	019	026	But Jesus looked on them, and said to them: With men, this is impossible; but with God, all things are possible.
040	MAT	019	027	Then Peter answered and said to him: Behold, we have left all and followed thee; what, then, shall we have?
040	MAT	019	028	Jesus said to them: Verily I say to you, That, in the restoration, when the Son of man shall sit on his glorious throne, you also who have followed me shall sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
040	MAT	019	029	And every one that has left houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name’s sake, shall receive a hundred-fold, and shall inherit eternal life.
040	MAT	019	030	But many that are first shall be last; and the last first.
040	MAT	020	001	For the kingdom of heaven is like the master of a house, who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.
040	MAT	020	002	And when he had agreed with the laborers for a denarius a day, he sent them into his vineyard.
040	MAT	020	003	And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing in the market, idle;
040	MAT	020	004	and he said to them: Go you also into my vineyard, and whatever is right I will give you.
040	MAT	020	005	And they went. Again he went out about the sixth, and about the ninth hour, and did in like manner.
040	MAT	020	006	And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing idle, and said to them, Why do you stand here all the day idle?
040	MAT	020	007	They said to him: No man has hired us. He said to them: Go you also into the vineyard, and whatever is right you shall receive.
040	MAT	020	008	When the evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his steward: Call the laborers, and, beginning with the last, pay them their hire even to the first.
040	MAT	020	009	And when those came who had been hired about the eleventh hour, they received each one a denarius.
040	MAT	020	010	But when those came who had been hired first, they thought that they would receive more; and they received each one a denarius.
040	MAT	020	011	And when they received it, they murmured against the master of the house,
040	MAT	020	012	saying: These last have worked one hour, and you have made them equal to us, who have borne the burden of the day, and the heat.
040	MAT	020	013	But he answered and said to one of them: Friend, I do you no injustice; did you not agree with me for a denarius?
040	MAT	020	014	Take what is yours, and go; I will give to this last even as to you.
040	MAT	020	015	Is it not allowed me to do what I will with my own? Or, is your eye envious, because I am good?
040	MAT	020	016	So the last shall be first, and the first last. For many are called, but few are chosen.
040	MAT	020	017	And as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside on his journey, and said to them:
040	MAT	020	018	Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man shall be delivered to the chief priests and the scribes, and they will condemn him to death,
040	MAT	020	019	and will deliver him to the Gentiles to deride, and to scourge, and to crucify: and on the third day he shall rise again.
040	MAT	020	020	Then came to him the mother of the sons of Zebedee, with her sons, bowing down, and asking something of him.
040	MAT	020	021	He said to her: What do you wish? She said to him: Command that these two sons of mine may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left, in thy kingdom.
040	MAT	020	022	But Jesus answered and said: You know not what you ask. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink, and to be immersed with the immersion with which I am immersed? They said to him: We are able.
040	MAT	020	023	And he said to them: You shall drink my cup, and be immersed with the immersion with which I am immersed: but to sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not mine to give; but it shall be given to them for whom it has been prepared by my Father.
040	MAT	020	024	And when the ten heard it, their anger was aroused against the two brothers.
040	MAT	020	025	But Jesus called them to him, and said: You know that the rulers of the Gentiles act as lords over them, and their great men have authority over them.
040	MAT	020	026	It shall not be so among you. But whoever will be great among you, let him be your minister.
040	MAT	020	027	And whoever will be first among you, let him be your servant;
040	MAT	020	028	even as the Son of man came, not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.
040	MAT	020	029	And as they went out from Jericho, a great multitude followed him.
040	MAT	020	030	And behold, two blind men, sitting by the road, when they heard that Jesus was passing by, cried out, saying: Have mercy on us, Lord, son of David.
040	MAT	020	031	And the multitude charged them to be silent. But they cried the more, saying: Have mercy on us, Lord, son of David.
040	MAT	020	032	And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said: What do you wish me to do for you?
040	MAT	020	033	They said to him: Lord, that our eyes may be opened.
040	MAT	020	034	Jesus had compassion on them, and touched their eyes; and their eyes immediately received sight, and they followed him.
040	MAT	021	001	And when they drew near to Jerusalem, and had come to Bethphage, to the mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples,
040	MAT	021	002	saying to them: Go into the village opposite to you, and immediately you will find an ass tied, and a colt with her: loose them, and bring them to me.
040	MAT	021	003	And if any one say any thing to you, you shall reply: The Lord has need of them: and he will immediately send them.
040	MAT	021	004	All this was done, that the word might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying:
040	MAT	021	005	Say you to the daughter of Zion, Behold, your king comes to you, meek, and sitting upon an ass, and a colt the foal of an ass.
040	MAT	021	006	And the disciples went and did as Jesus commanded them;
040	MAT	021	007	and brought the ass and the colt, and put their mantles on them, and caused him to sit upon them.
040	MAT	021	008	And a very great multitude spread their mantles in the road: and others cut branches from the trees, and spread them in the road.
040	MAT	021	009	And the multitudes that went before, and that followed after, cried, saying: Hosanna to the son of David. Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.
040	MAT	021	010	And when he entered Jerusalem, all the city was moved, and said: Who is this?
040	MAT	021	011	And the multitude said: This is Jesus the prophet, that is from Nazareth of Galilee.
040	MAT	021	012	And Jesus went into the temple of God, and drove out all that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money-changers, and the seats of those who sold doves,
040	MAT	021	013	and said to them: It is written, My house shall be called a house of prayer; but you have made it a den of robbers.
040	MAT	021	014	And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple, and he cured them.
040	MAT	021	015	But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying, Hosanna to the son of David, their anger was aroused,
040	MAT	021	016	and they said to him: Do you not hear what these say? And Jesus said to them: Yes; have you never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?
040	MAT	021	017	And he left them, and went out of the city to Bethany, and there spent the night.
040	MAT	021	018	Now in the morning, as he was returning to the city, he was hungry:
040	MAT	021	019	and seeing a fig-tree on the road, he went to it, and found nothing on it but leaves; and he said to it: Let no fruit grow on you henceforth forever. And the fig-tree immediately withered.
040	MAT	021	020	And when the disciples saw it, they were astonished, and said: How soon has the fig-tree withered!
040	MAT	021	021	Jesus answered and said to them: Verily I say to you, If you have faith, and doubt not, you shall do, not only what is done to the fig-tree, but even if you shall say to this mountain, Be taken up, and be thrown into the sea, it shall be done.
040	MAT	021	022	And all things that you ask for in prayer, believing, you shall receive.
040	MAT	021	023	And after he had come into the temple, the chief priests and elders of the people came to him as he was teaching, and said: By what authority do you these things? And who gave you this authority?
040	MAT	021	024	Jesus answered and said to them: I also will ask you one thing, which if you will tell me, I also will tell you by what authority I do these things.
040	MAT	021	025	The immersion of John, whence was it? from heaven, or from men? But they reasoned among themselves, and said, If we reply, From heaven, he will say to us, Why then did you not believe him?
040	MAT	021	026	But if we reply, From men, we fear the multitude; for all regard John as a prophet.
040	MAT	021	027	And they answered and said to Jesus: We know not. And he said to them: Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.
040	MAT	021	028	But what think you? A man had two sons; and he went to the first, and said, Son, go work to-day in my vineyard.
040	MAT	021	029	He answered and said, I will not. But he afterward regretted it, and went.
040	MAT	021	030	And he came to the other, and spoke to him in like manner. And he answered and said, I go, sir; and went not.
040	MAT	021	031	Which of the two did the will of his father? They said to him, The first. Jesus said to them: Verily I say to you, The publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.
040	MAT	021	032	For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you believed him not. But the publicans and the harlots believed him. And you, when you had seen it, afterward felt no regret, that you might believe him.
040	MAT	021	033	Hear another parable: There was a master of a house who planted a vineyard, and put a hedge around it, and rigged in it a wine-press, and built a tower, and let it out to vine-dressers, and went into another country.
040	MAT	021	034	And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the vine-dressers to receive the fruits of it.
040	MAT	021	035	And the vine-dressers took his servants, and scourged one, and killed another, and stoned another.
040	MAT	021	036	Again he sent other servants more than the first: and they treated them in like manner.
040	MAT	021	037	But afterward he sent to them his son, saying, They will reverence my son.
040	MAT	021	038	But the vine-dressers, when they saw the son, said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and seize upon the inheritance.
040	MAT	021	039	And they took him, and carried him out of the vineyard, and killed him.
040	MAT	021	040	Therefore, when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those vine-dressers?
040	MAT	021	041	They said to him: He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and let out his vineyard to other vine-dressers, who will give him the fruits in their season.
040	MAT	021	042	Jesus said to them: Did you never read in the Scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the corner?
040	MAT	021	043	This was from the Lord, and it is wondrous in our eyes. For this reason, I say to you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation that will bring forth the fruits of it.
040	MAT	021	044	And he that falls upon this stone shall be dashed to pieces; but him on whom it shall fall, it will make like chaff for the wind.
040	MAT	021	045	And when the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they knew that he spoke of them.
040	MAT	021	046	And when they sought to lay hold of him, they feared the multitude, because they regarded him as a prophet.
040	MAT	022	001	And Jesus answering, spoke to them again in parables, saying:
040	MAT	022	002	The kingdom of heaven is like a king that made a marriage feast for his son;
040	MAT	022	003	and sent his servants to call those who had been invited to the marriage feast; and they refused to come.
040	MAT	022	004	Again, he sent other servants, saying, Tell those who have been invited, Behold, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come to the marriage feast.
040	MAT	022	005	But they were careless, and went away, one to his farm, another to his merchandise.
040	MAT	022	006	And the rest laid hold of his servants, and abused them, and killed them.
040	MAT	022	007	And when that king heard of it, he was angry, and sent his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city.
040	MAT	022	008	Then he said to his servants: The marriage feast is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy.
040	MAT	022	009	Go, therefore, to the cross-ways, and invite to the marriage feast as many as you find.
040	MAT	022	010	And those servants went out into the roads, and brought together all, as many as they found, both bad and good: and the banquet-room was filled with guests.
040	MAT	022	011	And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man that had not put on a wedding-robe.
040	MAT	022	012	And he said to him, Friend, how came you in hither without a wedding-robe? And he was silent.
040	MAT	022	013	Then the king said to his servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and throw him into the darkness without: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
040	MAT	022	014	For many are called, but few chosen.
040	MAT	022	015	Then the Pharisees went and held a consultation, that they might entrap him in his words.
040	MAT	022	016	And they sent to him their disciples, with the Herodians, saying: Teacher, we know that you are true, and that you teach the way of God in truth, and care not for any one: for you do not look upon the person of men.
040	MAT	022	017	Tell us, therefore, what do you think? Is it lawful to give tribute to Cæsar, or not?
040	MAT	022	018	But Jesus, knowing their wickedness, said to them: Why do you tempt me, hypocrites?
040	MAT	022	019	Show me the tribute-money. And they brought him a denarius.
040	MAT	022	020	And he said to them: Whose image and superscription is this?
040	MAT	022	021	They said to him: Cæsar’s. Then he said to them: Give, therefore, to Cæsar the things that are Cæsar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.
040	MAT	022	022	And when they heard it, they were astonished, and left him, and went away.
040	MAT	022	023	On that day there came to him the Sadducees, who say that there is no resurrection; and they put a question to him,
040	MAT	022	024	saying: Teacher, Moses commanded, If any one die without children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up children for his brother.
040	MAT	022	025	Now there were with us seven brothers; and the first took a wife, and died; and, having no child, left his wife to his brother.
040	MAT	022	026	In like manner also the second, and the third, to the seventh.
040	MAT	022	027	Last of all, the woman also died.
040	MAT	022	028	Therefore, in the resurrection, of which of the seven will she be the wife? for they all had her.
040	MAT	022	029	Jesus answered and said to them: You err, because you know neither the scriptures nor the power of God.
040	MAT	022	030	For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.
040	MAT	022	031	But, concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read that which was spoken to you by God, saying:
040	MAT	022	032	I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.
040	MAT	022	033	And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his teaching.
040	MAT	022	034	When the Pharisees heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they came together.
040	MAT	022	035	And one of them, who was a lawyer, asked him a question, that he might tempt him, saying:
040	MAT	022	036	Teacher, which is the great commandment in the law?
040	MAT	022	037	Jesus said to him: You shall love the Lord your God with your whole heart, and with your whole soul, and with your whole mind.
040	MAT	022	038	This is the first and great commandment.
040	MAT	022	039	And the second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.
040	MAT	022	040	On these two commandments hang the whole law and the prophets.
040	MAT	022	041	While the Pharisees were together, Jesus asked them a question,
040	MAT	022	042	saying: What think you of the Christ? whose son is he? They said to him: The son of David.
040	MAT	022	043	He said to them: How then does David in spirit call him Lord, saying,
040	MAT	022	044	The Lord said to my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand till I make thy enemies thy footstool.
040	MAT	022	045	If then David calls him Lord, how is he his son?
040	MAT	022	046	And no one was able to answer him a word; nor did any one, from that day, dare to ask him another question.
040	MAT	023	001	Then Jesus spoke to the multitudes, and to his disciples,
040	MAT	023	002	saying: The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses seat:
040	MAT	023	003	therefore, all things that they command you to observe, observe and do. But do not according to their works: for they command, and do not.
040	MAT	023	004	For they bind up burdens that are heavy and hard to be borne, and lay them on the shoulders of men; but they refuse to move them with one of their fingers.
040	MAT	023	005	And they do all their works for the purpose of being seen by men. They make their amulets broad, and enlarge the fringes of their mantles.
040	MAT	023	006	They also love the most honorable places at suppers, and the first seats in the synagogues,
040	MAT	023	007	and salutations in the markets, and to be called by men, Rabbi, Rabbi.
040	MAT	023	008	But you must not be called Rabbi; for one is your leader, and all of you are brethren.
040	MAT	023	009	And call no man on earth your father; for one is your Father, who is in heaven.
040	MAT	023	010	And be not called leaders; for one is your leader, the Christ.
040	MAT	023	011	And the greatest among you shall be your minister.
040	MAT	023	012	Whoever exalts himself shall be humbled; and whoever humbles himself shall be exalted.
040	MAT	023	013	But alas for you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you eat up the houses of widows, and for a pretext make long prayers. For this reason, you shall receive the greater condemnation.
040	MAT	023	014	Alas for you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you close the kingdom of heaven in the face of men; for you neither go in yourselves, nor do you suffer those who are entering, to go in.
040	MAT	023	015	Alas for you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you traverse sea and land to make one proselyte; and when he is made, you make him twofold more a child of hell than yourselves.
040	MAT	023	016	Alas for you, blind guides! who say, Whoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, becomes a debtor.
040	MAT	023	017	Fools and blind! for which is greater, the gold, or the temple that sanctifies the gold?
040	MAT	023	018	And, Whoever shall swear by the altar, it is nothing; but whoever shall swear by the gift that is on it, becomes a debtor.
040	MAT	023	019	Fools and blind! for which is greater, the gift, or the altar that sanctifies the gift?
040	MAT	023	020	Therefore, whoever swears by the altar, swears by it, and by all that is on it.
040	MAT	023	021	And whoever swears by the temple, swears by it, and by him that dwells in it.
040	MAT	023	022	And he that swears by heaven, swears by the throne of God, and by him that sits upon it.
040	MAT	023	023	Alas for you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you pay tithes of mint and dill and cummin, and have neglected the weightier matters of the law, its justice, its mercy, and its faithfulness. These you ought to have done, and those you ought not to have neglected.
040	MAT	023	024	Blind guides! who strain out a gnat, but swallow a camel.
040	MAT	023	025	Alas for you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you make clean the outside of the cup and the plate; but within they are full of rapine and excess.
040	MAT	023	026	Blind Pharisee! first make clean the inside of the cup and the plate, that the outside of them also may be clean.
040	MAT	023	027	Alas for you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you are like whitened sepulchers, which without appear beautiful, but within are full of dead men’s bones, and of all uncleanness.
040	MAT	023	028	So also you outwardly appear to men to be just, but within you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.
040	MAT	023	029	Alas for you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you build the tombs of the prophets, and adorn the sepulchers of the righteous,
040	MAT	023	030	and say: If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.
040	MAT	023	031	So then you testify against yourselves, that you are the sons of those who killed the prophets.
040	MAT	023	032	Do you also fill up the measure of your fathers.
040	MAT	023	033	Serpents, generation of vipers, how can you escape the condemnation of hell?
040	MAT	023	034	For this reason, behold, I send you prophets and wise men and scribes; and some of them you will kill and crucify; and some of them you will scourge in your synagogues, and persecute from city to city;
040	MAT	023	035	that upon you may come all the righteous blood which has been shed upon the earth, from the blood of Abel the just to the blood of Zachariah, the son of Barachiah, whom you slew between the temple and the altar.
040	MAT	023	036	Verily I say to you, All these things shall come upon this generation.
040	MAT	023	037	Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets and stonest those who are sent to thee, how often have I desired to gather thy children together, as a bird gathers her young under her wings, and you refused.
040	MAT	023	038	Behold, your house is left to you deserted.
040	MAT	023	039	For I say to you, That you shall not see me henceforth, till you shall say, Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord.
040	MAT	024	001	And Jesus went out, and was departing from the temple, and his disciples came to him to point out to him the buildings of the temple.
040	MAT	024	002	But Jesus said to them: Do you not see all these things? Verily I say to you, There shall not be left here a stone upon a stone that shall not be thrown down,
040	MAT	024	003	And as he was sitting upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, and said: Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the age?
040	MAT	024	004	And Jesus answered and said to them: Take heed that no one deceive you.
040	MAT	024	005	For many will come in my name, saying, I am the Christ; and will deceive many.
040	MAT	024	006	And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars: see that you be not troubled, for all things must be fulfilled; but the end is not yet.
040	MAT	024	007	For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there will be famines and pestilences and earthquakes in various places.
040	MAT	024	008	But all these are the beginning of sorrows.
040	MAT	024	009	Then they will deliver you up to affliction, and kill you; and you will be hated by all nations on my account.
040	MAT	024	010	And then will many be ensnared, and they will deliver one another up, and hate one another;
040	MAT	024	011	and many false prophets will arise, and deceive many;
040	MAT	024	012	and because iniquity abounds, the love of many will grow cold.
040	MAT	024	013	But he that endures to the end, shall be saved.
040	MAT	024	014	And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in the whole habitable earth, for a testimony to all nations, and then shall the end come.
040	MAT	024	015	When, therefore, you see that detestable thing that makes desolate, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place, (let him that reads understand; )
040	MAT	024	016	then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains;
040	MAT	024	017	let not him that is on the house-top come down to take his goods out of his house;
040	MAT	024	018	and let not him that is in the field turn back to take his clothing.
040	MAT	024	019	But alas for those who are with child, and those who give suck in those days!
040	MAT	024	020	Pray that your flight may not be in the winter, nor on the Sabbath:
040	MAT	024	021	for then shall be great affliction, such as has not been from the beginning of the world till now, nor shall ever be.
040	MAT	024	022	And unless those days should be made few, no flesh could be saved. But on account of the elect those days shall be made few.
040	MAT	024	023	Then if any one shall say to you: Lo! here is the Christ, or there; believe it not.
040	MAT	024	024	For false Christs and false prophets will arise, and will show great signs and wonders, so as to deceive, if possible, even the elect.
040	MAT	024	025	Behold, I have told you beforehand.
040	MAT	024	026	Therefore, if they say to you: Behold, he is in the desert; go not out: Behold, he is in the secret chambers; believe it not.
040	MAT	024	027	For as the lightning comes out from the east, and shines even to the west, so also shall the coming of the Son of man be.
040	MAT	024	028	For wherever the carcass is, there will the vultures come together.
040	MAT	024	029	Immediately after the affliction of those days, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the hosts of the heavens shall be shaken.
040	MAT	024	030	And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven; and then shall all the tribes of the land mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.
040	MAT	024	031	And he will send his angels with a trumpet of great voice, and they shall gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.
040	MAT	024	032	Learn now a parable from the fig-tree: As soon as its branch becomes tender, and puts forth leaves, you know that summer is near.
040	MAT	024	033	So also, when you see all these things, know that it is near at the doors.
040	MAT	024	034	Verily I say to you, This generation shall not pass away till all these things shall have taken place.
040	MAT	024	035	Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.
040	MAT	024	036	But of that day and hour no one knows, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only.
040	MAT	024	037	But as the days of Noah were, so shall be the coming of the Son of man.
040	MAT	024	038	For as in the days before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, till the day in which Noah entered the ark,
040	MAT	024	039	and knew not, till the flood came and took them all away: so shall be the coming of the Son of man.
040	MAT	024	040	Then two men shall be in the field; one shall be taken, and the other left.
040	MAT	024	041	Two women shall be grinding at the mill; one shall be taken, and the other left.
040	MAT	024	042	Watch, therefore, for you know not at what hour your Lord is coming.
040	MAT	024	043	But know this, That if the master of the house had known at what watch the thief comes, he would have watched, and would not have permitted his house to be broken open.
040	MAT	024	044	For this reason, be you also ready; for at an hour in which you think not, the Son of man comes.
040	MAT	024	045	Who then is that faithful and wise servant, whom his master has made ruler over his household servants, to give them their food in due time?
040	MAT	024	046	Blessed is that servant, whom his master, when he comes, shall find so doing.
040	MAT	024	047	Verily I say to you, That he will make him ruler over all his goods.
040	MAT	024	048	But if that wicked servant shall say in his heart, My master delays his coming;
040	MAT	024	049	and shall begin to strike his fellow-servants, and shall eat and drink with the drunken;
040	MAT	024	050	the master of that servant will come in a day in which he looks not for him, and at an hour which he knows not,
040	MAT	024	051	and will cut him in two, and appoint him his part with the hypocrites. There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
040	MAT	025	001	Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened to ten virgins, who took their lamps and went out to meet the bride-groom.
040	MAT	025	002	Five of them were wise, and five were foolish.
040	MAT	025	003	Those who were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:
040	MAT	025	004	but the wise took oil in their vessels, with their lamps.
040	MAT	025	005	While the bridegroom delayed, they all slumbered and slept.
040	MAT	025	006	And at midnight a cry was made: Behold, the bridegroom comes! Go you out to meet him.
040	MAT	025	007	Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.
040	MAT	025	008	And the foolish said to the wise: Give us of your oil, for our lamps are going out.
040	MAT	025	009	But the wise answered, saying: Lest there may not be enough for us and you, go rather to those who sell, and buy for yourselves.
040	MAT	025	010	While they were going to buy, the bridegroom came; and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage-supper; and the door was closed.
040	MAT	025	011	Afterward the other virgins also came, and said: Lord! Lord! open for us.
040	MAT	025	012	But he answered and said: Verily I say to you, I know you not.
040	MAT	025	013	Watch, therefore, for you know neither the day nor the hour.
040	MAT	025	014	For as a man, on leaving his country, called his own servants, and delivered to them his goods:
040	MAT	025	015	To one he gave five talents; to another, two; and to another, one; to each one, according to his own ability, and immediately left his country.
040	MAT	025	016	Then he that had received the five talents, went and traded with them, and made other five talents.
040	MAT	025	017	In like manner also, he that had received the two, gained other two.
040	MAT	025	018	But he that had received the one, went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord’s money.
040	MAT	025	019	After a long time, the lord of those servants came and settled with them.
040	MAT	025	020	And he that had received the five talents came and brought other five talents, and said: Lord, you delivered to me five talents: see, I have gained other five talents in addition to them.
040	MAT	025	021	His lord said to him: Well done, good and faithful servant; you have been faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many. Enter into the joy of your lord.
040	MAT	025	022	And he also that had received the two talents came, and said: Lord, you delivered to me two talents; see, I have gained other two talents in addition to them.
040	MAT	025	023	His lord said to him: Well done, good and faithful servant; you have been faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many. Enter into the joy of your lord.
040	MAT	025	024	But he that had received the one talent came, and said: Lord, I knew you, that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not scatter.
040	MAT	025	025	And I was afraid, and went and hid your talent in the earth; see, you have yours.
040	MAT	025	026	His lord answered and said to him: Wicked and slothful servant; did you know that I reap where I did not sow, and gather where I did not scatter?
040	MAT	025	027	Therefore, you ought to have put my money with the bankers; and, when I came, I could have received my own with interest.
040	MAT	025	028	Therefore, take from him the talent, and give it to him that has the ten talents.
040	MAT	025	029	For to every one that has, it shall be given, and he shall have abundance. But from him that has not, even that which he has shall be taken away.
040	MAT	025	030	And cast the unprofitable servant into the darkness without. There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
040	MAT	025	031	When the Son of man shall come in his own glory, and all the holy angels with him, then will he sit on the throne of his own glory;
040	MAT	025	032	and all nations shall be gathered before him; and he will separate them one from another, as a shepherd separates his sheep from the goats.
040	MAT	025	033	And he will place the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on his left.
040	MAT	025	034	Then the King will say to those on his right hand: Come, you blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.
040	MAT	025	035	For I was hungry, and you gave me food; I was thirsty, and you gave me drink; I was a stranger, and you took me to your houses;
040	MAT	025	036	naked, and you clothed me; I was sick, and you visited me; I was in prison, and you came to me.
040	MAT	025	037	Then will the righteous answer him, saying: Lord, when did we see thee hungry, and feed thee? or thirsty, and give thee drink?
040	MAT	025	038	When did we see thee a stranger, and take thee to our home? or naked, and clothe thee?
040	MAT	025	039	When did we see thee sick, or in prison, and come to thee?
040	MAT	025	040	And the King will answer and say to them: Verily I say to you, Inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these my brethren, you did it to me.
040	MAT	025	041	Then will he say to those on his left hand: Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire, prepared for the devil and his angels.
040	MAT	025	042	For I was hungry, and you gave me no food; I was thirsty, and you gave me no drink;
040	MAT	025	043	I was a stranger, and you took me not to your houses; naked, and you did not clothe me; I was sick, and in prison, and you did not visit me.
040	MAT	025	044	Then they also will answer, and say: Lord, when did we see thee hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister to thee?
040	MAT	025	045	Then will he answer them, saying: Verily I say to you, Inasmuch as you did it not to one of the least of these, you did it not to me.
040	MAT	025	046	And these shall go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.
040	MAT	026	001	And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these words, that he said to his disciples:
040	MAT	026	002	You know that after two days the passover is kept, and the Son of man is delivered up to be crucified.
040	MAT	026	003	Then the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people met together at the palace of the chief priest, who was called Caiaphas.
040	MAT	026	004	And they consulted together that they might take Jesus by craft and kill him.
040	MAT	026	005	But they said: Not during the feast, lest there be a tumult among the people.
040	MAT	026	006	When Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,
040	MAT	026	007	there came to him a woman who had an alabaster box of very costly ointment; and she poured it on his head as he reclined at table.
040	MAT	026	008	But when his disciples saw it, they were displeased, and said: For what purpose was this waste?
040	MAT	026	009	For this could have been sold for much, and given to the poor.
040	MAT	026	010	Jesus perceived it, and said to them: Why do you trouble the woman? For she has performed a good work upon me.
040	MAT	026	011	For you have the poor always with you, but me you have not always.
040	MAT	026	012	For in pouring this ointment on my body, she has done it to prepare me for burial.
040	MAT	026	013	Verily I say to you, Wherever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, this also which she has done shall be told for a memorial of her.
040	MAT	026	014	Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests,
040	MAT	026	015	and said: What are you willing to give me, and I will deliver him to you? And they weighed to him thirty pieces of silver.
040	MAT	026	016	And from that time he sought an opportunity to deliver him up.
040	MAT	026	017	On the first day of unleavened bread, the disciples came to Jesus, and said to him: Where dost thou wish that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?
040	MAT	026	018	He replied: Go into the city, to a certain man, and say to him, The Teacher says, My time is near; I will keep the passover at your house, with my disciples.
040	MAT	026	019	And the disciples did as Jesus commanded them, and prepared the passover.
040	MAT	026	020	When the evening had come, he reclined at table with the twelve.
040	MAT	026	021	And as they were eating, he said: Verily I say to you, One of you will deliver me up.
040	MAT	026	022	And they were very sad, and began each one of them to say to him: Lord, is it I?
040	MAT	026	023	He answered and said: He that dips his hand with me in the dish, will deliver me up.
040	MAT	026	024	The Son of man goes, as it is written of him; but alas for that man by whom the Son of man is delivered up! It would have been good for that man, if he had not been born.
040	MAT	026	025	And Judas, who delivered him up, answered and said: Rabbi, is it I? He replied: You have said.
040	MAT	026	026	And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and gave it to the disciples, and said: Take, eat; this is my body.
040	MAT	026	027	And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying: Do you all drink of it:
040	MAT	026	028	for this is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many in order to the remission of sins.
040	MAT	026	029	But I say to you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, till that day when I drink it with you new in the kingdom of my Father.
040	MAT	026	030	And when they had sung a hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.
040	MAT	026	031	Then Jesus said to them: All of you will he offended at me this night; for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered.
040	MAT	026	032	But after I have risen, I will go before you into Galilee.
040	MAT	026	033	Peter answered and said to him: Though all shall be offended at thee, yet will I never be offended.
040	MAT	026	034	Jesus said to him: Verily I say to you, This night, before the cock crows, you will deny me three times.
040	MAT	026	035	Peter said to him: Though it should be necessary for me to die with thee, I will not deny thee. In like manner said all the disciples.
040	MAT	026	036	Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to his disciples: Sit here, till I go and pray yonder.
040	MAT	026	037	And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be in deep distress and anguish of soul.
040	MAT	026	038	Then Jesus said to them: My soul is encompassed with sorrow even to death; remain here, and watch with me.
040	MAT	026	039	And he went forward a little, and fell on his face in prayer, saying: My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me; yet not as I will, but as thou willest.
040	MAT	026	040	And he came to his disciples, and found them sleeping; and he said to Peter: Was it so, that you had not strength to watch with me one hour?
040	MAT	026	041	Watch and pray, lest you enter into temptation. The spirit is, willing, but the flesh is weak.
040	MAT	026	042	Again, a second time, he went away, and prayed, saying: My Father, if this cup cannot pass from me, unless I drink it, thy will be done.
040	MAT	026	043	And he came and found them sleeping again, for their eyes were heavy.
040	MAT	026	044	And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same thing.
040	MAT	026	045	Then he came to his disciples, and said to them: Bleep what time is left, and take your rest; behold, the hour draws near, and the Son of man is delivered into the hands of sinners.
040	MAT	026	046	Arise, let us go; behold, he that delivers me up is at hand.
040	MAT	026	047	And while he was yet speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs, came from the chief priests and elders of the people.
040	MAT	026	048	He that delivered him up had given them a sign, saying: The one that I shall kiss is he; hold him fast.
040	MAT	026	049	And immediately he came to Jesus, and said: Hail, Rabbi! and kissed him.
040	MAT	026	050	Jesus said to him: Friend, for what purpose have you come? Then they came, and laid hands on Jesus, and held him fast.
040	MAT	026	051	And behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck the servant of the chief priest, and cut off his ear.
040	MAT	026	052	Then Jesus said to him: Put back your sword into its place; for all that take the sword, shall perish by the sword.
040	MAT	026	053	Do you think that I can not now call upon my Father, and he would cause more than twelve legions of angels to stand by me?
040	MAT	026	054	But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?
040	MAT	026	055	At the same time Jesus said to the multitudes: Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs, to take me? I sat daily with you in the temple and taught, and you did not take me.
040	MAT	026	056	All this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples left him and fled.
040	MAT	026	057	And those who took Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the chief priest, where the scribes and elders had come together.
040	MAT	026	058	But Peter followed him, at a distance, to the palace of the chief priest, and went in and sat with the attendants, to see the end.
040	MAT	026	059	And the chief priests and the elders, and the whole Sanhedrin, sought false testimony against Jesus, that they might put him to death,
040	MAT	026	060	and found none. Though many false witnesses came, yet they found none. At last two false witnesses came,
040	MAT	026	061	and said: This man said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.
040	MAT	026	062	And the chief priest arose, and said to him: Do you make no answer? What do these testify against you?
040	MAT	026	063	But Jesus remained silent. And the chief priest answered and said to him: I adjure you, by the living God, that you tell us whether you are the Christ, the Son of God?
040	MAT	026	064	Jesus said to him: You have said. Moreover, I say to you, Hereafter you shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of the Almighty, and coming upon the clouds of heaven.
040	MAT	026	065	Then the chief priest rent his clothes, and said: He has spoken impiously; what further need have we of witnesses? See now, you have heard his impious words:
040	MAT	026	066	What think you? They answered and said: He is a subject for death.
040	MAT	026	067	Then did they spit in his face, and strike him with their fists; some struck him with the open hand,
040	MAT	026	068	and said: Give a response to us, Christ: Who is he that struck you?
040	MAT	026	069	But Peter was sitting without in the court; and a maid-servant came to him, and said: You also were with Jesus of Galilee.
040	MAT	026	070	But he denied before them all, saying: I know not what you say.
040	MAT	026	071	And when he went out into the entrance, another maid-servant saw him, and said to those who were there: This man was also with Jesus the Nazarene.
040	MAT	026	072	And again he denied, with an oath: I know not the man.
040	MAT	026	073	After a little while, those who stood by came and said to Peter: Of a truth you also are one of them, for your speech betrays you.
040	MAT	026	074	Then he began to curse and to swear, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew.
040	MAT	026	075	And Peter remembered the word which. Jesus had spoken to him: Before the cock crows, you will deny me three times. And he went out, and wept bitterly.
040	MAT	027	001	When the morning came, all the chief priests and elders of the people held a consultation against Jesus, that they might put him to death.
040	MAT	027	002	And they bound him and led him away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor.
040	MAT	027	003	Then Judas, who had delivered him up, when he saw that he was condemned, stung by remorse, brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,
040	MAT	027	004	saying: I have sinned in having delivered up innocent blood. They replied: What is that to us? You will see to that.
040	MAT	027	005	And he threw down the money in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself.
040	MAT	027	006	And the chief priests took the money, and said: It is not lawful to put it into the sacred treasury, because it is the price of blood.
040	MAT	027	007	And they took counsel, and bought with it the potter’s field, as a burial-place for foreigners.
040	MAT	027	008	For this reason, that field is called the field of blood, to this day.
040	MAT	027	009	Then the word was fulfilled which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying: And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that had a price set upon him, on whom some of the children of Israel did set a price,
040	MAT	027	010	and gave them for the potter’s field, as the Lord appointed me.
040	MAT	027	011	And Jesus stood before the governor; and the governor asked him, saying: Are you the king of the Jews? Jesus replied to him: You say it.
040	MAT	027	012	And when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he made no answer.
040	MAT	027	013	Then Pilate said to him: Do you not hear how many things they testify against you?
040	MAT	027	014	And he gave him answer to not one word, so that the governor was greatly astonished.
040	MAT	027	015	Now at the feast, the governor was in the habit of releasing to the multitude one prisoner, whom they chose.
040	MAT	027	016	They then had a notorious prisoner, called Barabbas.
040	MAT	027	017	Therefore, while they were together, Pilate said to them: Which do you wish me to release to you, Barabbas, or Jesus, who is called Christ?
040	MAT	027	018	For he knew that through envy they had delivered him up.
040	MAT	027	019	While he was sitting on the judgment-seat, his wife sent to him, saying: Have nothing to do with that just man, for I have suffered much to-day in a dream, because of him.
040	MAT	027	020	But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitude to ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.
040	MAT	027	021	The governor answered and said to them: Which of the two do you wish me to release to you? They replied: Barabbas.
040	MAT	027	022	Pilate said to them: What then shall I do with Jesus, who is called Christ? They all said to him: Let him be crucified.
040	MAT	027	023	But the governor said: Why, what evil has he done? But they cried vehemently, saying: Let him be crucified.
040	MAT	027	024	When Pilate saw that he gained nothing, but rather that a tumult was rising, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, and said: I am innocent of the blood of this just man; you will see to it.
040	MAT	027	025	And all the people answered and said: His blood be upon us and upon our children.
040	MAT	027	026	Then he released to them Barabbas; but after he had scourged Jesus, he delivered him up to be crucified.
040	MAT	027	027	Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the palace, and brought together to him the whole band.
040	MAT	027	028	And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet cloak;
040	MAT	027	029	and when they had plaited a crown of thorn branches, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand; and kneeling before him, they derided him, saying: Hail, King of the Jews!
040	MAT	027	030	And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and struck him on the head.
040	MAT	027	031	And when they had derided him, they took off the cloak from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him away to crucify him.
040	MAT	027	032	And as they were going out, they found a man of Cyrene, named Simon: this man they compelled to carry his cross.
040	MAT	027	033	And when they had come to a place called Golgotha, which, when translated, is the place of a skull,
040	MAT	027	034	they gave him vinegar to drink, mingled with gall; and when he had tasted it, he refused to drink.
040	MAT	027	035	And when they had crucified him, they divided his clothing among themselves, by casting the lot.
040	MAT	027	036	And they sat down and watched him there.
040	MAT	027	037	And they placed above his head the charge that was made against him, written: THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
040	MAT	027	038	Then were two robbers crucified with him; one on his right hand, and the other on his left.
040	MAT	027	039	And they that passed by reviled him, shaking their heads,
040	MAT	027	040	and saying: You that destroy the temple, and build it in three days, save yourself; if you are the Son of God, come down from the cross.
040	MAT	027	041	In like manner also the chief priests, with the scribes and elders, derided him, and said:
040	MAT	027	042	He saved others; himself he can not save. If he is the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe on him.
040	MAT	027	043	He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he delights in him; for he said: I am the Son of God.
040	MAT	027	044	The robbers also that were crucified with him, uttered the same reproaches against him.
040	MAT	027	045	From the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land till the ninth hour.
040	MAT	027	046	But about the ninth hour, Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying: Eli, Eli, lamah sabachthani? that is, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?
040	MAT	027	047	Some of those who were standing there, when they heard it, said: This man calls for Elijah.
040	MAT	027	048	And immediately one of them ran, and took a sponge, and having filled it with vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink.
040	MAT	027	049	The rest said: Wait, let us see if Elijah is coming to save him.
040	MAT	027	050	And Jesus again cried with a loud voice, and gave up his spirit.
040	MAT	027	051	And behold, the vail of the temple was rent in two from top to bottom. And the earth did shake, and the rocks were rent:
040	MAT	027	052	and the sepulchers were opened, and many bodies of the saints that slept, arose.
040	MAT	027	053	And they came out of their sepulchers after his resurrection, and entered the holy city, and appeared to many.
040	MAT	027	054	Now the centurion, and those who were with him watching Jesus, when they saw the earthquake, and what was done, were greatly afraid, and said: Of a truth, this was the Son of God.
040	MAT	027	055	Many women that had followed Jesus from Galilee, and had ministered to him, were there, looking on from a distance.
040	MAT	027	056	Among these was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.
040	MAT	027	057	When the evening had come, there came a rich man of Arimathea, named Joseph; and he also was a disciple of Jesus.
040	MAT	027	058	This man went to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be given.
040	MAT	027	059	And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in clean linen,
040	MAT	027	060	and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock. And he rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb, and departed.
040	MAT	027	061	And Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting opposite the tomb.
040	MAT	027	062	On the morrow, which was the day after the preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees came together to Pilate,
040	MAT	027	063	and said: Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will arise.
040	MAT	027	064	Therefore, command that the sepulcher be made safe till the third day, lest his disciples come and steal him away, and say to the people, He has risen from the dead; and the last error will be worse than the first.
040	MAT	027	065	Pilate said to them: You have a guard; go, make it as safe as you know how.
040	MAT	027	066	And they went and made the sepulcher safe, by placing a seal upon the stone, and setting the guard.
040	MAT	028	001	And after the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the sepulcher.
040	MAT	028	002	And behold, there had been a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord having descended from heaven, came and rolled away the stone from the door, and sat upon it.
040	MAT	028	003	His appearance was like lightning, and his raiment was white as snow.
040	MAT	028	004	From fear of him the keepers did shake and become like dead men.
040	MAT	028	005	But the angel answered and said to the women: Fear not; for I know that you seek Jesus, who was crucified.
040	MAT	028	006	He is not here; for he has risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.
040	MAT	028	007	And go quickly, and tell his disciples, that he has risen from the dead: and behold, he goes before you into Galilee. There you shall see him. Lo, I have told you.
040	MAT	028	008	And they went out quickly from the sepulcher, with fear and great joy, and ran to tell his disciples.
040	MAT	028	009	And as they were going to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying: Hail! And they came and laid hold of his feet, and worshiped him.
040	MAT	028	010	Then Jesus said to them: Fear not; go, tell my brethren to go into Galilee, and there they shall see me.
040	MAT	028	011	While they were going, behold, some of the guard came into the city, and told the chief priests all things that were done.
040	MAT	028	012	And when they came together with the elders, they held a consultation, and gave much money to the soldiers,
040	MAT	028	013	saying: Say that his disciples came by night and stole him away, while we were asleep.
040	MAT	028	014	And if this shall be heard in the presence of the governor, we will persuade him, and make you secure.
040	MAT	028	015	And they took the money, and did as they were taught. And their report of this matter is everywhere published among the Jews to this day.
040	MAT	028	016	And the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into the mountain, where Jesus had appointed to meet them.
040	MAT	028	017	And when they saw him, they worshiped him; but some doubted.
040	MAT	028	018	And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying: All authority in heaven and on earth is given to me.
040	MAT	028	019	Go, therefore, make disciples of all nations, immersing them (the disciples) into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit;
040	MAT	028	020	teaching them to observe all things whatever I have commanded you: and lo; I am with you all the days, even to the end of the age.

# BOOK	041	MAR	Mark	Mark
041	MAR	001	001	The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God;
041	MAR	001	002	as it is written in Isaiah the prophet: Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way.
041	MAR	001	003	The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make ready the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.
041	MAR	001	004	John was immersing in the wilderness, and preaching the immersion of repentance in order to the remission of sins.
041	MAR	001	005	And all the country of Judea and the inhabitants of Jerusalem went out to him, and were all immersed by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.
041	MAR	001	006	And John was clothed with camel’s hair, and had a girdle of leather around his loins, and he ate locusts and wild honey:
041	MAR	001	007	and he preached, saying: There comes after me One mightier than I, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and loose.
041	MAR	001	008	I immerse you in water; but he will immerse you in the Holy Spirit.
041	MAR	001	009	And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was immersed by John in the Jordan.
041	MAR	001	010	And immediately on coming up from the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him.
041	MAR	001	011	And there was a voice from the heavens: Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I delight.
041	MAR	001	012	And immediately the Spirit compelled him to go forth into the wilderness.
041	MAR	001	013	And he was there in the wilderness forty days, to be tempted by Satan; and he was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered to him.
041	MAR	001	014	But after John was delivered up, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,
041	MAR	001	015	and saying: The time has fully come, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent, and believe the gospel.
041	MAR	001	016	And as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon, and Andrew the brother of Simon, throwing a net about in the sea; for they were fishers.
041	MAR	001	017	And Jesus said to them: Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men.
041	MAR	001	018	And immediately they left their nets, and followed him.
041	MAR	001	019	And when he had gone a little further thence, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the ship, mending their nets.
041	MAR	001	020	And he immediately called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him.
041	MAR	001	021	And they went into Capernaum; and immediately, on the sabbath, he entered the synagogue, and taught.
041	MAR	001	022	And they were astonished at his teaching; for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes.
041	MAR	001	023	And there was in their synagogue a man who had an unclean spirit; and he cried out,
041	MAR	001	024	saying: Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, Jesus, thou Nazarene? Hast thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.
041	MAR	001	025	And Jesus rebuked him, saying: Be silent, and come out of him.
041	MAR	001	026	And the unclean spirit threw him into convulsions, and cried with a loud voice, and came out of him.
041	MAR	001	027	And all were amazed, so that they questioned one another, saying: What means this? What new teaching is this, that with authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him?
041	MAR	001	028	And his fame immediately went abroad into all the surrounding country of Galilee.
041	MAR	001	029	And forthwith, having gone out of the synagogue, they went into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.
041	MAR	001	030	Now the mother-in-law of Simon lay sick of a fever. And at once they told him of her.
041	MAR	001	031	And he went to her, and took her by the hand, and raised her up, and the fever left her instantly; and she ministered to them.
041	MAR	001	032	And at evening, when the sun had gone down, they brought to him all that were sick, and those who were possessed with demons.
041	MAR	001	033	And the whole city came together to the door.
041	MAR	001	034	And he cured many that were sick of various diseases, and cast out many demons, and did not suffer the demons to speak, because they knew him.
041	MAR	001	035	And very early in the morning, while it was yet dark, he arose and went out, and departed to a desert place, and there prayed.
041	MAR	001	036	And Simon, and those who were with him, followed after him.
041	MAR	001	037	And when they had found him, they said to him: All are seeking for thee.
041	MAR	001	038	And he said to them: Let us go into the neighboring towns, that I may preach there also; for I have come forth for this purpose.
041	MAR	001	039	And throughout the whole of Galilee he continued to preach in their synagogues, and to cast out demons.
041	MAR	001	040	And there came to him a leper, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying to him: If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.
041	MAR	001	041	And Jesus, moved with compassion, stretched forth his hand, and touched him, and said to him: I will; be clean.
041	MAR	001	042	And when he had spoken, the leprosy immediately departed from him, and he was cleansed.
041	MAR	001	043	And he strictly charged him, and forthwith sent him away,
041	MAR	001	044	and said to him: See that you tell no one; but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing the things which Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.
041	MAR	001	045	But he went out, and began to proclaim it much, and to publish the matter abroad, so that he was no longer able to enter a city openly, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.
041	MAR	002	001	And again he entered Capernaum, after some days; and they heard that he was in the house.
041	MAR	002	002	And immediately many came together, so that the house could contain them no longer, nor could the space about the door. And he preached the word to them.
041	MAR	002	003	And they came to him, bringing a paralytic, who was carried by four men.
041	MAR	002	004	And not being able to come near him, on account of the multitude, they took off the roof where he was, and having broken through, they let down the bed on which the paralytic lay.
041	MAR	002	005	And Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the paralytic: Son, your sins are forgiven you.
041	MAR	002	006	But some of the scribes were sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts:
041	MAR	002	007	Why does this man thus speak impiously? Who can forgive sins but God only?
041	MAR	002	008	And Jesus, immediately perceiving in his spirit that they thus reasoned within themselves, said to them: Why are you reasoning thus in your hearts?
041	MAR	002	009	Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, Your sins are forgiven; or to say, Arise, take up your bed and walk?
041	MAR	002	010	But that you may know that the Son of man on earth has authority to forgive sins, (he said to the paralytic, )
041	MAR	002	011	I say to you, Arise, take up your bed and go to your house.
041	MAR	002	012	And he arose forthwith, and took up his bed, and went out before them all; so that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying: We have never seen it thus.
041	MAR	002	013	And he went out again by the sea: and all the multitude came to him, and he taught them.
041	MAR	002	014	And as he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphæus sitting at the custom-house; and he said to him: Follow me. And he arose and followed him.
041	MAR	002	015	And it came to pass, as Jesus reclined at table in his house, that many publicans and sinners reclined with him and his disciples; for there were many, and they followed him.
041	MAR	002	016	And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eating with publicans and sinners, they said to his disciples: Why is it that he eats and drinks with publicans and sinners?
041	MAR	002	017	And when Jesus heard it, he said to them: Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. I have not come to call righteous men, but sinners.
041	MAR	002	018	And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees were in the habit of fasting; and they came, and said to him: Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples fast not?
041	MAR	002	019	And Jesus said to them: Can the sons of the bride-chamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they can not fast.
041	MAR	002	020	But the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then they will fast in those days.
041	MAR	002	021	No one sews a patch of new cloth on an old garment; if so, the new piece which fills it up, takes from the old, and a worse rent is made.
041	MAR	002	022	And no one puts new wine into old bottles; if so, the new wine bursts the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the bottles are destroyed. But new wine must be put into new bottles.
041	MAR	002	023	And it came to pass, that he was going on the sabbath-day through the fields of grain: and his disciples began, as they went, to pull the ears of grain.
041	MAR	002	024	And the Pharisees said to him: See, why are they doing on the sabbath-day what is not lawful?
041	MAR	002	025	And he said to them: Did you never read what David did, when he had need and was hungry, he and those who were with him?
041	MAR	002	026	How he entered the house of God in the days of Abiathar the chief priest, and ate the loaves of the presence, which, it is not lawful, except for the priests, to eat, and gave to those also who were with him?
041	MAR	002	027	And he said to them: The sabbath was made for man, not man for the sabbath.
041	MAR	002	028	Therefore, the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.
041	MAR	003	001	And again he entered the synagogue, and a man was there who had a withered hand.
041	MAR	003	002	And they watched him, whether he would cure him on the sabbath-day, that they might accuse him.
041	MAR	003	003	And he said to the man who had the withered hand: Arise, and come into the midst.
041	MAR	003	004	And he said to them: Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath-day, or to do evil? to save life, or to kill? But they were silent.
041	MAR	003	005	And looking around on them with anger, being grieved for the hardness of their heart, he said to the man: Stretch forth your hand; and he stretched it forth: and his hand was restored.
041	MAR	003	006	And the Pharisees immediately went out with the Herodians, and held a consultation against him, that they might destroy him.
041	MAR	003	007	And Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the sea; and there followed him a great multitude from Galilee, and from Judea,
041	MAR	003	008	and from Jerusalem, and from Idumea, and from beyond the Jordan: and those about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they heard what things he was doing, came to him.
041	MAR	003	009	And he spoke to his disciples, that a small ship should continue near him, because of the multitude, that they might not press upon him.
041	MAR	003	010	For he cured many, so that as many as had diseases rushed upon him, that they might touch him.
041	MAR	003	011	And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and cried out, saying: Thou art the Son of God.
041	MAR	003	012	And he strictly charged them, that they should not make him known.
041	MAR	003	013	And he went up into a mountain, and called to him such as he wished, and they came to him.
041	MAR	003	014	And he appointed twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach,
041	MAR	003	015	and to have authority to cure diseases, and to cast out demons.
041	MAR	003	016	And Simon he surnamed Peter;
041	MAR	003	017	and James the sou of Zebedee, and John the brother of James: and these he surnamed Boanerges, which means, sons of thunder:
041	MAR	003	018	and Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the Son of Alphæus, and Thaddæus, and Simon the Canaanite,
041	MAR	003	019	and Judas Iscariot, who also delivered him up. And they went into a house:
041	MAR	003	020	and the multitude came together again, so that they were not able even to eat bread.
041	MAR	003	021	And when his relatives heard of it, they came out to take him; for they said: He is beside himself.
041	MAR	003	022	And the scribes who had come down from Jerusalem said: He has Beelzebul; and by the prince of the demons he casts out the demons.
041	MAR	003	023	And he called them to him, and spoke to them in parables: How can Satan cast out Satan?
041	MAR	003	024	And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom can not stand.
041	MAR	003	025	And if a house be divided against itself, that house can not stand.
041	MAR	003	026	And if Satan rise up against himself, and be divided, he can not stand, but has an end.
041	MAR	003	027	No one can enter the house of the strong man, and spoil his goods, unless he first bind the strong man; and then he will plunder his house.
041	MAR	003	028	Verily I say to you, All sins shall be forgiven the sons of men, and whatever impious speeches they may utter;
041	MAR	003	029	but whoever will speak impiously against the Holy Spirit shall never have forgiveness, but is subject to eternal condemnation.
041	MAR	003	030	For they said: He has an unclean spirit.
041	MAR	003	031	His mother and his brothers came, therefore, and standing without, sent to him, and called him.
041	MAR	003	032	And the multitude was sitting about him; and they said to him: Behold, your mother and your brothers are without, seeking you.
041	MAR	003	033	And he answered them and said: Who is my mother, or my brothers?
041	MAR	003	034	And he looked round about on those who were sitting near him, and said: Behold, my mother and my brothers;
041	MAR	003	035	for whoever will do the will of God, is my brother, and my sister, and mother.
041	MAR	004	001	And again he began to teach by the sea; and a great multitude came together to him, so that he went into a ship, and sat in the sea: and the whole multitude was on the land near the sea.
041	MAR	004	002	And he taught them many things in parables, and said to them in his teaching:
041	MAR	004	003	Hear; Behold, the sower went forth to sow;
041	MAR	004	004	and it came to pass, as he sowed, that some seed fell by the wayside, and the birds came and ate it up.
041	MAR	004	005	Other seed fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth: and it immediately sprung up, because it had no depth of earth.
041	MAR	004	006	And when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.
041	MAR	004	007	And other seed fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it produced no fruit.
041	MAR	004	008	And other seed fell in the good ground, and produced fruit that grew up and increased, and produced, one thirty, one sixty, and one a hundred.
041	MAR	004	009	And he said: He that has ears to hear, let him hear.
041	MAR	004	010	And when he was alone, those who were about him, with the twelve, asked him the meaning of the parable.
041	MAR	004	011	And he said to them: To you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God; but to those who are without, all things are done in parables;
041	MAR	004	012	that they may surely see, and not perceive; and that they may surely hear, and not understand; lest they should turn to me, and their sins should be forgiven them.
041	MAR	004	013	And he said to them: Do you not understand this parable? And how then will you understand all parables?
041	MAR	004	014	The sower sows the word.
041	MAR	004	015	These are they that received seed by the wayside, where the word is sown; and when they hear, Satan immediately comes and takes away the word that was sown in their hearts.
041	MAR	004	016	And these are they that, in like manner, received seed in stony places: who, when they hear the word, immediately receive it with joy:
041	MAR	004	017	and they have no root in themselves, but endure for a time; afterward, when affliction or persecution arises on account of the word, they immediately take offense.
041	MAR	004	018	And these are they that received seed among thorns; who hear the word,
041	MAR	004	019	and the anxieties of this age, and the deceitfulness of riches, and desires for other things enter in and choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.
041	MAR	004	020	And these are they that received seed on the good ground; who hear the word, and receive it, and bring forth fruit, one thirty, and one sixty, and one a hundred.
041	MAR	004	021	And he said to them: Is a lamp brought in that it may be put under the measure, or under the divan? Is it not brought that it may be put on the lamp-stand?
041	MAR	004	022	For there is nothing hid that shall not be made known; nor has any thing been concealed, but that it may come into open view.
041	MAR	004	023	If any one has ears to hear, let him hear.
041	MAR	004	024	And he said to them: Take heed how you hear; with what measure you measure, it shall be measured to you; and to you that hear, more shall be given;
041	MAR	004	025	for whoever has, to him shall be given; and whoever has not, even that which he has shall be taken from him.
041	MAR	004	026	And he said: So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should sow seed in the ground,
041	MAR	004	027	and should sleep and rise, night and day, and the seed should spring up and grow, he knows not how.
041	MAR	004	028	For the earth, of its own accord, produces fruit, first the blade; then the ear, then the full grain in the ear.
041	MAR	004	029	But when the fruit is ripe, immediately he sends forth the sickle, because the harvest is ready.
041	MAR	004	030	And he said: To what shall we liken the kingdom of God? Or, by what similitude shall we illustrate it?
041	MAR	004	031	It is like a grain of mustard, which, when it is sown in the ground, is less than all seeds that are in the ground;
041	MAR	004	032	yet, when it is sown, it grows up, and becomes larger than all garden-plants, and sends out great branches, so that the birds of the air can roost under its shadow.
041	MAR	004	033	And with many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear.
041	MAR	004	034	But without a parable he did not speak to them; but when alone, he explained all things to his disciples.
041	MAR	004	035	And on the same day, when it was evening, he said to them: Let us go over to the opposite side.
041	MAR	004	036	And when they had sent the multitude away, they took him with them, as he was in the ship; and there were other little ships with him.
041	MAR	004	037	And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves dashed into the ship, so that it was now full.
041	MAR	004	038	And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on the pillow. And they awoke him, and said to him: Teacher, carest thou not that we perish?
041	MAR	004	039	And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea: Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.
041	MAR	004	040	And he said to them: Why are you so fearful? How is it that you have no faith?
041	MAR	004	041	And they were greatly afraid, and said one to another: Who, then, is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?
041	MAR	005	001	And they came to the opposite side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes.
041	MAR	005	002	And when he had come out of the ship, immediately there met him from the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,
041	MAR	005	003	who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no one could keep him bound even with chains;
041	MAR	005	004	because he had often been bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been pulled to pieces by him, and the fetters had been broken, and no one had strength to subdue him;
041	MAR	005	005	and always, night and day, he was in the tombs, and in the mountains, crying out, and cutting himself with stones.
041	MAR	005	006	And when he saw Jesus at a distance, he ran and did him homage;
041	MAR	005	007	and crying out with a loud voice, he said: What have I to do with thee, Jesus, Son of God Most High? I adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not.
041	MAR	005	008	For he had said to him: Unclean spirit, come out of the man.
041	MAR	005	009	And he asked him: What is your name? And he said to him: My name is Legion; for we are many.
041	MAR	005	010	And he earnestly besought him that he would not send them out of the country.
041	MAR	005	011	Now a great herd of swine was feeding there near the mountain.
041	MAR	005	012	And the demons besought him, saying: Send us to the swine, that we may enter into them.
041	MAR	005	013	And Jesus immediately gave them leave. And the unclean spirits came out and entered into the swine; and the herd (they were about two thousand, ) rushed down a steep place into the sea, and were strangled in the sea.
041	MAR	005	014	And those who fed them fled, and told it in the city, and in the country. And they came out to see what had been done;
041	MAR	005	015	and they came to Jesus and saw the demoniac, who had had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.
041	MAR	005	016	And those who had seen it told them how it had happened to the demoniac, and also concerning the swine.
041	MAR	005	017	And they began to beseech him to depart from their borders.
041	MAR	005	018	And when he had entered the ship, he that had been possessed with the demons besought him that he might be with him.
041	MAR	005	019	And he did not permit him, but said to him: Go home to your relatives, and make known to them what things the Lord has done for you, and that he has had compassion on you.
041	MAR	005	020	And he went away and began to proclaim in Decapolis what things Jesus had done for him. And all were astonished.
041	MAR	005	021	And when Jesus had again gone over in the ship to the opposite side, a great multitude came together to him; and he was near the sea.
041	MAR	005	022	And behold, there came one of the rulers of the synagogue, named Jairus; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet,
041	MAR	005	023	and besought him earnestly, saying: My little daughter is at the point of death; come, lay thy hands on her, that she may be saved, and she will live.
041	MAR	005	024	And he went with him; and a great multitude followed him, and pressed upon him.
041	MAR	005	025	And a certain woman who had had an issue of blood for twelve years,
041	MAR	005	026	and had suffered much from many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was in no way benefited, but rather grew worse,
041	MAR	005	027	when she heard of Jesus, came behind him in the multitude, and touched his mantle;
041	MAR	005	028	for she said: If I may even touch his clothes, I shall be saved.
041	MAR	005	029	And immediately the fountain of her blood dried up, and she knew in her body that she was cured of that plague.
041	MAR	005	030	And Jesus, immediately perceiving in himself that power had gone forth from him, turned around in the multitude and said: Who touched my clothes?
041	MAR	005	031	And his disciples said to him: Thou seest the multitude pressing upon thee, and dost thou say, Who touched me?
041	MAR	005	032	And he looked around to see her that had done this.
041	MAR	005	033	But the woman, fearing and trembling, knowing; what had been done within her, came and fell down before him; and told him all the truth.
041	MAR	005	034	And he said to her: Daughter, your faith has saved you; go in peace, and be cured of your plague.
041	MAR	005	035	While he was yet speaking, some came from the ruler of the synagogue, who said: Your daughter is dead; why give the Teacher further trouble?
041	MAR	005	036	But as soon as Jesus heard what was spoken, he said to the ruler of the synagogue: Fear not, only believe.
041	MAR	005	037	And he suffered no one to follow him, except Peter and James and John the brother of James.
041	MAR	005	038	And he came to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and saw the tumult, and those who were weeping and wailing greatly.
041	MAR	005	039	And he went in and said to them: Why do you make a tumult and weep? The child is not dead, but sleeps.
041	MAR	005	040	And they derided him. But when he had put them all out, he took the father and mother of the child, and those who were with him, and went in where the child was lying.
041	MAR	005	041	And he took the child by the hand, and said to her: Talitha kumi; which is, when translated, Maiden, (I say to you, ) arise.
041	MAR	005	042	And the maiden immediately arose and walked, for she was twelve years old. And they were greatly astonished.
041	MAR	005	043	And he charged them strictly that no one should know this. And he commanded that something should be given her to eat.
041	MAR	006	001	And he departed thence, and came into his own country; and his disciples followed him.
041	MAR	006	002	And when the sabbath came, he began to teach in the synagogue. And many that heard him were astonished, and said: Whence has this man these things? and what wisdom is this which is given to him, that even such mighty deeds are done by his hands?
041	MAR	006	003	Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James and Joses and Judah and Simon? And are not his sisters here with us? And they found in him cause for offense.
041	MAR	006	004	But Jesus said to them: A prophet is not without honor, unless in his own country, and among his own relatives, and in his own house.
041	MAR	006	005	And he was unable to do any mighty deed there, except that he laid his hands on a few sick persons and cured them;
041	MAR	006	006	and he wondered at their unbelief. And he went to the villages round about, and taught.
041	MAR	006	007	And he called to him the twelve, and began to send them out, two and two, and gave them authority over unclean spirits.
041	MAR	006	008	And he commanded them to take nothing for their journey, but a staff only; no bag, no bread, no money in their purses;
041	MAR	006	009	but to be shod with sandals, and not to put on two coats.
041	MAR	006	010	And he said to them: Wherever you enter a house, there make your home till you depart from that place.
041	MAR	006	011	And whoever will not receive you, nor hear you, when you go out from that place, shake off the dust under your feet, for a testimony against them. Verily I say to you, It shall be more tolerable for Sodom or Gomorrah in the day of judgment, than for that city.
041	MAR	006	012	And they went out and preached that men should repent;
041	MAR	006	013	and they cast out many demons, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and cured them.
041	MAR	006	014	And Herod the king heard of him, for his name had become known; and he said: John the Immerser has risen from the dead, and for this reason, the powers of the spiritual world are active within him.
041	MAR	006	015	Others said: He is Elijah. Others said: He is a prophet like one of the prophets.
041	MAR	006	016	But when Herod heard of him, he said: John, whom I beheaded, has risen from the dead.
041	MAR	006	017	For Herod himself had sent and taken John, and bound him in prison on account of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip; for he had married her.
041	MAR	006	018	For John said to Herod: It is not lawful for you to have your brother’s wife.
041	MAR	006	019	And Herodias was angry with him, and desired to have him killed, and was not able;
041	MAR	006	020	for Herod feared John, because he knew him to be a just and holy man; and he kept him in safety. And having heard him, he did many things, and heard him with pleasure.
041	MAR	006	021	And a suitable day having come, when Herod, on his birthday, made a supper for his great men, and his chief officers, and the first men of Galilee;
041	MAR	006	022	and the daughter of this Herodias having come in, and danced, and pleased Herod and his guests, the king said to the maiden: Ask me what you will, and I will give it to you.
041	MAR	006	023	And he swore to her: Whatever you ask, I will give you, to the half of my kingdom.
041	MAR	006	024	But she went out, and said to her mother: What shall I ask? She replied: The head of John the Immerser.
041	MAR	006	025	And she came in immediately, with haste, to the king, and made her request, saying: I desire that you give me, at once, in a dish, the head of John the Immerser.
041	MAR	006	026	And the king was very sad; yet, on account of his oath and his guests, he would not reject her.
041	MAR	006	027	And the king immediately sent one of his guards, and commanded his head to be brought.
041	MAR	006	028	And he went and beheaded him in the prison, and brought his head in a dish, and gave it to the maiden; and the maiden gave it to her mother.
041	MAR	006	029	And when his disciples heard of it, they came and took away his body, and laid it in a tomb.
041	MAR	006	030	And the apostles came together to Jesus, and told him all things, both what they had done and what they had taught.
041	MAR	006	031	And he said to them: Come yourselves privately into a desert place, and rest awhile. For there were many coming and going, and they had not leisure even to eat.
041	MAR	006	032	And they went away, by ship, into a desert place, privately.
041	MAR	006	033	And many saw them departing, and recognized him; and they ran thither on foot from all the cities, and went before them, and came together to him.
041	MAR	006	034	And when Jesus came out, he saw a great multitude, and had compassion on them, because they were as sheep that had no shepherd. And he began to teach them many things.
041	MAR	006	035	And when much of the day was now spent, his disciples came to him, and said: This is a desert place, and much of the day is now spent;
041	MAR	006	036	send them away, that they may go into the country and the villages round about, and buy bread for themselves: for they have nothing to eat.
041	MAR	006	037	He answered and said to them: Do you give them food. And they said to him: Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread, and give them food?
041	MAR	006	038	He said to them: How many loaves have you? Go and see. And when they had learned, they said: Five, and two fishes.
041	MAR	006	039	And he commanded them to make all recline in table parties upon the green grass.
041	MAR	006	040	And they reclined in oblong squares, by hundreds, and by fifties.
041	MAR	006	041	And he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looked up to heaven, and blessed; and he broke the loaves, and gave them to the disciples to place before them. And he divided the two fishes among them all.
041	MAR	006	042	And they all ate, and were satisfied;
041	MAR	006	043	and they took up twelve baskets full of the broken pieces, and of the fishes.
041	MAR	006	044	And those who ate of the loaves were about five thousand men.
041	MAR	006	045	And he immediately compelled his disciples to get into the ship, and to go before him to the opposite side, to Bethsaida, while he sent the multitude away.
041	MAR	006	046	And when he had sent them away, he went into the mountain to pray.
041	MAR	006	047	And when evening came, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and he alone upon the land.
041	MAR	006	048	And he saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was against them. And about the fourth watch of the night, he came to them, walking on the sea, and intended to pass by them.
041	MAR	006	049	But when they saw him walking on the sea, they thought it was a specter, and cried out;
041	MAR	006	050	for they all saw him, and were troubled. And he immediately spoke to them, and said: Take courage; it is I; be not afraid.
041	MAR	006	051	And he went up to them into the ship; and the wind ceased. And they were greatly amazed in themselves beyond measure, and wondered;
041	MAR	006	052	for they had learned nothing from the loaves: for their heart was hardened.
041	MAR	006	053	And when they had passed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret, and drew the ship ashore.
041	MAR	006	054	And when they had come out of the ship, the people immediately recognized him,
041	MAR	006	055	and ran through the whole of that region round about, and began to carry the sick on beds, wherever they heard that he was.
041	MAR	006	056	And whatever place he entered, whether villages or cities or country, they laid the sick in the market-places, and besought him that they might touch even the fringe of his mantle: and as many as touched him were saved.
041	MAR	007	001	And there came together to him the Pharisees, and some of the scribes, who had come from Jerusalem:
041	MAR	007	002	and when they saw some of his disciples eating bread with common, that is, with unwashed hands:
041	MAR	007	003	(for the Pharisees and all the Jews eat not, unless they wash their hands carefully, because they hold the tradition of the elders:
041	MAR	007	004	and when they come from the market, they do not eat, unless they immerse themselves. And there are many other things, which they have received to hold, as the immersion of cups and pitchers and brazen vessels and beds: )
041	MAR	007	005	then the Pharisees and the scribes asked him: Why do your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashed hands?
041	MAR	007	006	He answered and said to them: Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.
041	MAR	007	007	In vain do they worship me, teaching precepts, the commandments of men.
041	MAR	007	008	For, neglecting the commandment of God, you hold the tradition of men, the immersion of pitchers and cups; and many other things like these you do.
041	MAR	007	009	And he said to them: Well do you reject the commandment of God, that you may keep your own tradition.
041	MAR	007	010	For Moses said: Honor your father and your mother; and, He that curses father or mother shall surely be put to death.
041	MAR	007	011	But you say: If a man shall say to his father or mother, Whatever of mine might benefit you, is Corban, (which means, a gift, )
041	MAR	007	012	you no longer suffer him to do any thing for his father or mother,
041	MAR	007	013	making the word of God of no effect by your tradition, which you have delivered; and many things like these you do.
041	MAR	007	014	And he called the whole multitude to him, and said to them: Hear me, all of you, and understand.
041	MAR	007	015	There is nothing without that, by entering into a man, can defile him. But those things which come out of the man, defile him.
041	MAR	007	016	If any one has ears to hear, let him hear.
041	MAR	007	017	And when he had gone into the house, away from the multitude, his disciples asked him about the dark saying.
041	MAR	007	018	And he said to them: Are you also so void of understanding? Do you not perceive that nothing from without, by entering into a man, can defile him?
041	MAR	007	019	Because it does not enter into his heart, but into his belly, and goes out into the sink, cleansing all food.
041	MAR	007	020	And he said: What comes out of the man, is that which defiles the man.
041	MAR	007	021	For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed the purposes which are evil: adulteries, lewd actions, murders,
041	MAR	007	022	thefts, schemes for extortion, wicked deeds, deceit, wantonness, an evil eye, calumny, haughtiness, impiety.
041	MAR	007	023	All these evil things come forth from within, and defile the man.
041	MAR	007	024	And he arose and departed thence to the borders of Tyre and Sidon. And he entered a house, and desired that no one should know it; but he could not escape notice.
041	MAR	007	025	For a woman, whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet;
041	MAR	007	026	(the woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation, ) and she besought him to cast the demon out of her daughter.
041	MAR	007	027	But Jesus said to her: Let the children be satisfied first; for it is not good to take the children’s bread and throw it to the little dogs.
041	MAR	007	028	She answered and said to him: Yes, Lord; and yet you can help me, for the little dogs under the table eat of the children’s crumbs.
041	MAR	007	029	And he said to her: For this saying, go your way: the demon has gone out of your daughter.
041	MAR	007	030	And she went to her house, and found the demon gone out, and her daughter lying upon the bed.
041	MAR	007	031	And again he went out from the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and came to the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the borders of Decapolis.
041	MAR	007	032	And they brought to him a deaf man, who spoke with difficulty; and they besought him to lay his hand upon him.
041	MAR	007	033	And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;
041	MAR	007	034	and looking up to heaven, he sighed, and said to him: Ephphatha, which means, Be opened.
041	MAR	007	035	And immediately his ears were opened, and the band of his tongue was loosed, and he spoke plainly.
041	MAR	007	036	And he charged them to tell no one; but the more he charged them, the more earnestly they published it.
041	MAR	007	037	And they were amazed beyond measure, and said: He Las done all things well: he makes the deaf hear and the dumb speak.
041	MAR	008	001	In those days, the multitude being very great, and having nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples to him and said to them:
041	MAR	008	002	I have compassion on the multitude, because they have continued with me now three days, and have nothing to eat.
041	MAR	008	003	And if I send them home fasting, they will faint on the way; for some of them have come from afar.
041	MAR	008	004	And his disciples answered him: Whence will any one be able to satisfy these men with bread, here in the wilderness?
041	MAR	008	005	And he asked them: How many loaves have you? And they said: Seven.
041	MAR	008	006	And he commanded the multitude to recline on the ground. And he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and broke them, and gave them to the disciples to set before them: and they set them before the multitude.
041	MAR	008	007	And they had a few small fishes; and he blessed, and commanded that they also be set before them.
041	MAR	008	008	And they ate, and were satisfied; and they took up what remained of the broken pieces, seven baskets.
041	MAR	008	009	And those who had eaten were about four thousand; and he sent them away.
041	MAR	008	010	And he immediately entered the ship with his disciples, and went into the regions of Dalmanutha.
041	MAR	008	011	And the Pharisees came out, and began to put questions to him, asking of him a sign from heaven, that they might tempt him.
041	MAR	008	012	And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and said: Why does this generation seek for a sign? Verily I say to you, No sign will be given to this generation.
041	MAR	008	013	And he left them, and entered the ship again, and departed to the opposite side.
041	MAR	008	014	And they had forgotten to take bread; and they had but one loaf with them in the ship.
041	MAR	008	015	And he charged them, saying: Take heed, and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod.
041	MAR	008	016	And they reasoned with one another, saying: It is because we have no bread.
041	MAR	008	017	And Jesus perceived it, and said to them: Why do you reason, because you have no bread? Do you not yet perceive, nor understand? Is your heart still hardened?
041	MAR	008	018	Having eyes, do you not see? and having ears, do you not hear? and do you not remember?
041	MAR	008	019	When I broke the five loaves among the five thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up? They said to him: Twelve.
041	MAR	008	020	When I broke the seven among the four thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up? They replied: Seven.
041	MAR	008	021	And he said to them: How is it that you do not understand?
041	MAR	008	022	And he came to Bethsaida; and they brought to him a blind man, and besought him to touch him.
041	MAR	008	023	And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the village. And he spit on his eyes, and laid his hands on him, and asked him if he saw any thing.
041	MAR	008	024	And he looked up and said: I see men, like trees, walking.
041	MAR	008	025	Then he again laid his hands on his eyes, and made him look up. And he was restored, and saw all things clearly.
041	MAR	008	026	And he sent him away to his house, and said: Neither go into the village, nor tell it to any one in the village.
041	MAR	008	027	And Jesus and his disciples went out into the villages of Cæsarea Philippi. And on the road, he asked his disciples, saying to them: Who do men say that I am?
041	MAR	008	028	They answered: John the Immerser; and others, Elijah; and others, one of the prophets.
041	MAR	008	029	And he said to them: But who say you that I am? Peter answered and said to him: Thou art the Christ.
041	MAR	008	030	And he charged them to tell no one concerning him.
041	MAR	008	031	And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, and the chief priests, and the scribes, and be put to death, and after three days rise again.
041	MAR	008	032	And he spoke this saying plainly. And Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him.
041	MAR	008	033	But he turned about, and, looking on his disciples, rebuked Peter, saying: Get behind me, adversary: for you are not thinking of the things of God, but of the things of men.
041	MAR	008	034	And he called to him the multitude with his disciples, and said to them: Whoever determines to follow after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.
041	MAR	008	035	For whoever will save his life, shall lose it; but whoever will lose his life for my sake and the gospel’s, shall save it.
041	MAR	008	036	For what will it profit a man, if he gain the whole world, and lose his own life?
041	MAR	008	037	Or, what will a man give as a ransom for his life?
041	MAR	008	038	For whoever will be ashamed of me, and my words, in this sinful and adulterous generation, of him the Son of man also will be ashamed, when he comes in the glory of his Father, with the holy angels.
041	MAR	009	001	And he said to them: Verily I say to you, There are some of these standing here who shall not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God come in power.
041	MAR	009	002	And after six days, Jesus took with him Peter and James and John, and led them up alone into a high mountain apart; and he was transfigured before them;
041	MAR	009	003	and his raiment became shining, exceeding white like snow, as no fuller on earth could whiten them.
041	MAR	009	004	And there appeared to them Elijah, with Moses; and they were talking with Jesus.
041	MAR	009	005	And Peter answering, said to Jesus: Rabbi, it is good for us to be here; and let us make three tents, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.
041	MAR	009	006	For he knew not what to say, for they were greatly afraid.
041	MAR	009	007	And there was a cloud that overshadowed them; and a voice came from the cloud, This is my beloved Son; hear him.
041	MAR	009	008	And suddenly looking around, they no longer saw any one but Jesus only with themselves.
041	MAR	009	009	And as they were coming down from the mountain, he charged them to tell no one what they had seen, till the Son of man should rise from the dead.
041	MAR	009	010	And they kept the matter to themselves, inquiring of one another what the rising from the dead could mean.
041	MAR	009	011	And they asked him, saying: Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?
041	MAR	009	012	And he answered and said to them: Elijah comes first, and restores all things, and, as it is written of the Son of man, that he must suffer many things, and be despised, so Elijah is to suffer.
041	MAR	009	013	But I say to you, that Elijah has already come, and they have clone to him what they wished: [as it is written of him.]
041	MAR	009	014	And when he came to his disciples, he saw a great multitude about them, and scribes disputing with them.
041	MAR	009	015	And at once, all the multitude, on seeing him, were struck with awe, and ran to him and saluted him.
041	MAR	009	016	And he asked the scribes: Why are you disputing with, them?
041	MAR	009	017	And one of the multitude answered and said: Teacher, I brought to you my son, who has a dumb spirit.
041	MAR	009	018	And wherever it seizes him, it throws him into convulsions; and he foams, and gnashes with his teeth, and pines away: and I spoke to your disciples to cast him out, and they were not able.
041	MAR	009	019	And he answered them, and said: O faithless generation! how long shall I be with you? how long shall I bear with you? Bring him to me.
041	MAR	009	020	And they brought him to him. And when he saw him, the spirit immediately threw him into convulsions; and he fell on the ground, and rolled himself, foaming.
041	MAR	009	021	And he asked his father: How long is it since this came upon him? He replied: From childhood.
041	MAR	009	022	And often it throws him into the fire, and into the water, to destroy him. But if you are able to do any thing, have compassion on us, and help us.
041	MAR	009	023	Jesus said to him: If you are able to believe, all things are possible to him that believes.
041	MAR	009	024	And immediately the father of the child cried out, and with tears said: Lord, I believe; help my unbelief.
041	MAR	009	025	When Jesus saw that a multitude came running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, and said to it: Dumb and deaf spirit, I command you, come out of him, and enter into him no more.
041	MAR	009	026	And the spirit cried out, and threw him into strong convulsions, and came out of him; and he was like one dead, so that many said: He is dead.
041	MAR	009	027	But Jesus took him by the hand, and lifted him up, and he arose.
041	MAR	009	028	And when he had come into the house, his disciples asked him privately: Why were we not able to cast it out?
041	MAR	009	029	And he said to them: This kind can go out by nothing, but by prayer and fasting.
041	MAR	009	030	And they departed thence, and passed through Galilee; and he wished no one to know it.
041	MAR	009	031	For he taught his disciples, and said to them: The Son of man is to be delivered into the hands of men, and they will put him to death; and after he is put to death, he will rise on the third day.
041	MAR	009	032	But they did not understand this saying, and they were afraid to question him.
041	MAR	009	033	And he came into Capernaum; and when he was in the house, he asked them: What were you disputing about among yourselves along the road?
041	MAR	009	034	But they were silent. For they had been disputing with one another along the road which was greatest.
041	MAR	009	035	And he sat down and called the twelve, and said to them: If any one desires to be first, he shall be last of all, and servant of all.
041	MAR	009	036	And he took a little child, and placed it in the midst of them; and when he had taken it in his arms, he said to them:
041	MAR	009	037	Whoever will receive one of such children on my account, receives me; and whoever will receive me, receives not me, but him that sent me.
041	MAR	009	038	And John answered him and said: Teacher, we saw one casting out demons in thy name, and he does not follow us: and we forbade him, because he does not follow us.
041	MAR	009	039	But Jesus said: Forbid him not; for there is no one that will do a mighty deed in my name, and be able readily to speak evil of me.
041	MAR	009	040	For he that is not against us, is for us.
041	MAR	009	041	For whoever will give you a cup of water to drink on this account, because you are Christ’s, verily I say to you, he shall not lose his reward.
041	MAR	009	042	And whoever will ensnare one of these little ones that believe on me, it would be better for him if a millstone were hung about his neck, and he were thrown into the sea.
041	MAR	009	043	And if your hand ensnare you, cut it off: it is better for you to enter maimed into life, than having two hands to go away into hell, into the fire that is not quenched,
041	MAR	009	044	where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched.
041	MAR	009	045	And if your foot ensnare you, cut it off: it is better for you to enter into life lame, than having two feet to Be thrown into hell, into the fire that is not quenched,
041	MAR	009	046	where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched.
041	MAR	009	047	And if your eye ensnare you, pull it out: it is better for you to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be thrown into hell-fire,
041	MAR	009	048	where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched.
041	MAR	009	049	For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be seasoned with salt.
041	MAR	009	050	Salt is good; but if the salt shall have become saltless, by what means will you season it? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with one another.
041	MAR	010	001	And he arose and went thence into the borders of Judea, by the other side of the Jordan. And the multitudes again came together to him; and, as his custom was, he taught them again.
041	MAR	010	002	And the Pharisees came to him, and that they might tempt him, asked him the question: Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife?
041	MAR	010	003	He answered and said to them: What commandment did Moses give you?
041	MAR	010	004	They replied: Moses permitted us to write a bill of divorce, and put her away.
041	MAR	010	005	And Jesus answered and said to them: On account of the hardness of your hearts, he wrote this commandment for you.
041	MAR	010	006	But from the beginning of the creation, God made them male and female.
041	MAR	010	007	For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined to his wife;
041	MAR	010	008	and the two shall be one flesh. So, then, they are no longer two, but one flesh.
041	MAR	010	009	Therefore, what God has joined together, let not man put asunder.
041	MAR	010	010	And in the house, his disciples again asked him about the same matter.
041	MAR	010	011	And he said to them: Whoever puts away his wife, and marries another, commits adultery against her;
041	MAR	010	012	and if a woman puts away her husband, and is married to another, she commits adultery.
041	MAR	010	013	And they brought little children to him, that he might touch them: but his disciples rebuked those who brought them.
041	MAR	010	014	And when Jesus saw it, he was displeased, and said to them: Let the little children come to me, and forbid them not; for of such is the kingdom of God.
041	MAR	010	015	Verily I say to you, Whoever will not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, shall not enter into it.
041	MAR	010	016	And he took them in his arms, laid his hands on them, and blessed them.
041	MAR	010	017	And as he was going forth into the road, one ran and bowed the knee to him, and asked him: Good Teacher, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?
041	MAR	010	018	Jesus said to him: Why do you call me good? None is good but one, that is God.
041	MAR	010	019	You know the commandments, You shall not commit adultery; You shall not kill; You shall not steal; You shall not give false testimony; You shall not defraud; Honor your father and mother.
041	MAR	010	020	He answered and said to him: Teacher, all these I have kept from my youth.
041	MAR	010	021	And Jesus, looking on him, loved him, and said to him: One thing you lack; go, sell whatever you have, and give to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven: and come, take up the cross, and follow me.
041	MAR	010	022	But becoming sad at that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions.
041	MAR	010	023	And Jesus looked around, and said to his disciples: With what difficulty will those who have riches enter into the kingdom of God!
041	MAR	010	024	And his disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus, answering again, said to them: Children, how hard it is for those who trust in riches to enter the kingdom of God!
041	MAR	010	025	It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
041	MAR	010	026	And they were astonished beyond measure, and said among themselves: Who, then, can be saved?
041	MAR	010	027	Jesus looked on them and said: With men this is impossible, but not with God; for with God all things are possible.
041	MAR	010	028	And Peter began to say to him: Behold, we have left all and followed thee.
041	MAR	010	029	And Jesus answering, said: Verily I say to you, There is no one that has left house, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and for the sake of the gospel,
041	MAR	010	030	who shall not receive a hundred-fold, now in this time, houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and lands, with persecutions; and in the age to come, eternal life.
041	MAR	010	031	But many that are first shall be last; and the last first.
041	MAR	010	032	And they were in the road going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus went before them; and they were amazed, and as they followed, they were afraid. And again taking the twelve aside, he began to tell them what was about to befall him.
041	MAR	010	033	Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man will be delivered to the chief priests and the scribes, and they will condemn him to death, and deliver him to the Gentiles;
041	MAR	010	034	and they will deride him, and scourge him, and spit upon him, and kill him, and on the third day he will rise again.
041	MAR	010	035	And James and John the sons of Zebedee came to him, and said: Teacher, we desire you to do for us whatever we shall ask.
041	MAR	010	036	He said to them: What do you wish me to do for you?
041	MAR	010	037	They said to him: Grant to us that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and one on thy left, in thy glory.
041	MAR	010	038	Jesus said to them: You know not what you ask. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, and to be immersed with the immersion with which I am immersed?
041	MAR	010	039	They said to him: We are able. Jesus said to them: You shall drink the cup that I drink, and you shall be immersed with the immersion with which I am immersed.
041	MAR	010	040	But to sit on my right hand and on my left, is not mine to give; but it shall be given to those for whom it is prepared.
041	MAR	010	041	And when the ten heard it, they began to be displeased with James and John.
041	MAR	010	042	But Jesus called them to him, and said to them: You know that those who think they rule the Gentiles, act as lords over them; and their great men exercise authority over them.
041	MAR	010	043	But it shall not be so among you. But whoever desires to be great among you, shall be your minister;
041	MAR	010	044	and whoever among you desires to be first, shall be servant of all.
041	MAR	010	045	For the Son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.
041	MAR	010	046	And they came to Jericho: and as he was going out of Jericho, with his disciples and a great multitude, blind Bartimæus, the son of Timæus, was sitting on the roadside, begging.
041	MAR	010	047	And when he heard that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to cry out and say: Jesus, son of David, have mercy on me!
041	MAR	010	048	And many rebuked him, that he should be silent. But he cried out yet the more: Son of David, have mercy on me!
041	MAR	010	049	And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And they called the blind man, and said to him: Take courage; arise, he calls you.
041	MAR	010	050	And throwing away his mantle, he arose, and came to Jesus.
041	MAR	010	051	And Jesus answered and said to him: What do you wish me to do for you? The blind man said to him: Rabboni, that I may receive my sight.
041	MAR	010	052	And Jesus said to him: Go, your faith has saved you. And he immediately received his sight, and followed Jesus on the road.
041	MAR	011	001	And when they drew near to Jerusalem, as far as Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,
041	MAR	011	002	and said to them: Go into the village opposite you; and as soon as you enter it, you will find a colt tied, on which no man ever sat. Loose him and bring him.
041	MAR	011	003	And if any say to you: Why are you doing this? say that the Lord has need of him; and he will immediately send him hither.
041	MAR	011	004	And they went and found the colt tied near the door without, in the street. And they loosed him.
041	MAR	011	005	And some of those who were standing there, said to them: Why are you loosing the colt?
041	MAR	011	006	And they said to them as Jesus had commanded; and they gave them permission.
041	MAR	011	007	And they brought the colt to Jesus, and put their mantles upon him, and he sat on him.
041	MAR	011	008	And many spread their mantles in the road, and others cut branches from the trees, and spread them in the road.
041	MAR	011	009	And those who went before, and those who followed after, cried, saying: Hosanna. Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord.
041	MAR	011	010	Blessed is the coming kingdom of our Father David. Hosanna in the highest.
041	MAR	011	011	And Jesus entered Jerusalem, and went into the temple; and when he had looked around on all things, the hour being now late, he went out to Bethany with the twelve.
041	MAR	011	012	And on the morrow, as they were coming from Bethany, he was hungry;
041	MAR	011	013	and he saw at a distance a fig-tree that had leaves; and he went, if perhaps he might find any thing on it. And when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves; for it was not the time for figs.
041	MAR	011	014	And he answered and said to it: No more may any one ever eat fruit from you. And his disciples heard it.
041	MAR	011	015	And they came into Jerusalem; and Jesus entered the temple, and began to drive out those who sold, and those who bought in the temple; and he overturned the tables of the money-changers, and the seats of those who sold doves.
041	MAR	011	016	And he suffered no one to carry a vessel through the temple.
041	MAR	011	017	And he taught, saying to them: Is it not written, My house shall be called the house of prayer for all nations? But you have made it a den of robbers.
041	MAR	011	018	And the scribes and the chief priests heard him; and they sought how they might destroy him; for they feared him, because all the multitude were astonished at his teaching.
041	MAR	011	019	And when evening had come, he went out of the city.
041	MAR	011	020	And in the morning, as they were passing by, they saw the fig-tree withered from the roots.
041	MAR	011	021	And Peter, calling his words to mind, said to him: Rabbi, see! the fig-tree which thou didst curse has withered.
041	MAR	011	022	And Jesus answered and said to them: Have faith in God.
041	MAR	011	023	For, verily I say to you, that whoever will say to this mountain, Be removed, and be cast into the sea, and will not doubt in his heart, but believe that what he says will come to pass, he shall have whatever he says.
041	MAR	011	024	For this reason I say to you: All things that you ask for in prayer, believe that you will receive them, and they shall be yours.
041	MAR	011	025	And when you stand praying, forgive, if you have any thing against any one, that your Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your offenses.
041	MAR	011	026	But if you do not forgive, your Father who is in heaven will not forgive your offenses.
041	MAR	011	027	And they came again into Jerusalem; and as he was walking in the temple, there came to him the chief priests and the scribes and the elders,
041	MAR	011	028	and said to him: By what authority do you these things? and who gave you this authority to do these things?
041	MAR	011	029	And Jesus answered and said to them: I also will ask you one thing, and if you answer me, I will also tell you by what authority I do these things.
041	MAR	011	030	Was the immersion of John from heaven, or from men? answer me.
041	MAR	011	031	And they reasoned with themselves, saying: If we say, From heaven, he will reply, Why, then, did you not believe him?
041	MAR	011	032	But if we say, From men, they feared the people; for all regarded John as a prophet indeed.
041	MAR	011	033	And they answered and said to Jesus: We do not know. And Jesus answering, said to them: Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.
041	MAR	012	001	And he began to speak to them in parables: A man planted a vineyard, and set a hedge around it, and digged a wine-press, and built a tower, and let it out to vine-dressers, and went into another country.
041	MAR	012	002	And at the proper time, he sent a servant to the vine-dressers, that he might receive from the vine-dressers of the fruit of the vineyard.
041	MAR	012	003	And they took him and scourged him, and sent him away without any thing.
041	MAR	012	004	And again he sent to them another servant; and at him they threw stones, and wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully treated.
041	MAR	012	005	And again he sent another; and him they killed. And he sent many others, some of whom they scourged, and some they killed.
041	MAR	012	006	Therefore, having yet one son, his beloved, he sent him also to them last, saying, They will reverence my son.
041	MAR	012	007	But those vine-dressers said one to another, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.
041	MAR	012	008	And they took him, and killed him, and threw him out of the vineyard.
041	MAR	012	009	What, then, will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy those vine-dressers, and give his vineyard to others.
041	MAR	012	010	Have you not read this scripture: The stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the corner;
041	MAR	012	011	this was from the Lord, and it is wondrous in our eyes?
041	MAR	012	012	And they sought to take him, but feared the multitude; for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them; and they left him, and went away.
041	MAR	012	013	And they sent to him some of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, that they might entrap him in his words.
041	MAR	012	014	And they came and said to him: Teacher, we know that you are true, and that you care for no one; for you do not regard the person of men, but teach the way of God in truth. Is it lawful to give tribute to Cæsar, or not?
041	MAR	012	015	Must we give, or must we not give? But, knowing their hypocrisy, he said to them: Why do you tempt me? Bring me a denarius, that I may see it.
041	MAR	012	016	They brought it; and he said to them: Whose image and superscription is this? They said to him: Cæsar’s.
041	MAR	012	017	And Jesus answered and said to them: Give to Cæsar the things that are Cæsar’s, and to God the things that are God’s. And they were astonished at him.
041	MAR	012	018	And the Sadducees, who say that there is no resurrection, came to him, and put a question to him, saying:
041	MAR	012	019	Teacher, Moses wrote for us, If any man’s brother die, and leave a wife, and leave no children, his brother shall take his wife, and raise up children for his brother.
041	MAR	012	020	Now there were seven brothers; and the first took a wife, and dying, left no child;
041	MAR	012	021	and the second took her, and he died, and left no child; and the third, likewise;
041	MAR	012	022	and the seven took her, and left no child. Last of all, the woman also died.
041	MAR	012	023	Therefore, in the resurrection, when they rise, of which of them shall she be the wife? for the seven had her as a wife.
041	MAR	012	024	And Jesus answered and said to them: Do you not err for this reason, because you know not the scriptures, nor the power of God?
041	MAR	012	025	For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels in heaven.
041	MAR	012	026	But concerning the dead, that they do rise, have you not read in the book of Moses, at The Bush, how God spoke to him, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?
041	MAR	012	027	He is not the God of the dead, but of the living. Therefore, you do greatly err.
041	MAR	012	028	And one of the scribes came, and heard them reasoning together; and perceiving that he had answered them well, he asked him: Which is the first commandment of all?
041	MAR	012	029	And Jesus answered him: The first commandment of all is, Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord.
041	MAR	012	030	And you shall love the Lord your God with your whole heart, and with your whole soul, and with your whole mind, and with your whole strength. This is the first commandment.
041	MAR	012	031	And the second, which is like it, is this: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. There is no other commandment greater than these.
041	MAR	012	032	And the scribe said to him: Teacher, in truth you have well said, that there is one God, and there is no other beside him;
041	MAR	012	033	and to love him with the whole heart, and with the whole understanding, and with the whole soul, and with the whole strength, and to love one’s neighbor as himself, is more than all whole burnt-offerings and sacrifices.
041	MAR	012	034	And Jesus perceiving that he answered with understanding, said to him: You are not far from the kingdom of God. And no one, after that, ventured to ask him a question.
041	MAR	012	035	And Jesus, as he was teaching in the temple, answered and said: How say the scribes that the Christ is the son of David?
041	MAR	012	036	For David himself said by the Holy Spirit: The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand, till I make thy enemies thy footstool.
041	MAR	012	037	David himself, then, calls him Lord; and how is he his son? And the great multitude heard him with pleasure.
041	MAR	012	038	And he said to them in his teaching: Beware of the scribes, who love to walk in robes, and love salutations in the markets,
041	MAR	012	039	and the first seats in the synagogues, and the first places at suppers;
041	MAR	012	040	who eat up the houses of widows, and, as a pretext, make long prayers: these shall receive more abundant condemnation.
041	MAR	012	041	And Jesus, sitting opposite the treasury, observed how the multitude threw money into the treasury. And many rich persons threw in much.
041	MAR	012	042	And there came one poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing.
041	MAR	012	043	And he called his disciples to him, and said to them: Verily I say to you, this poor widow has thrown in more than all that have thrown into the treasury.
041	MAR	012	044	For all have thrown in out of their abundance; but she, out of her poverty, has thrown in all that she had, her whole living.
041	MAR	013	001	And as he was going out from the temple, one of his disciples said to him: Teacher, see what stones and what buildings!
041	MAR	013	002	And Jesus answering, said to him: Do you see these great buildings? There shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.
041	MAR	013	003	And as he sat on the mount of Olives, opposite the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately:
041	MAR	013	004	Tell us, when shall these things be? And what shall be the sign when all these things are about to be accomplished?
041	MAR	013	005	Jesus answering them, began to say: Take heed, lest any one deceive you.
041	MAR	013	006	For many will come in my name, saying, I am he, and will deceive many.
041	MAR	013	007	But when you hear of wars and rumors of wars, be not troubled; for these things must be: but not yet is the end.
041	MAR	013	008	For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there will be earthquakes in various places, and there will be famines, and tumults.
041	MAR	013	009	These are the beginning of sorrows. But take heed to yourselves; for they will deliver you up to councils, and you will be scourged in the synagogues; and you will stand before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them.
041	MAR	013	010	And the gospel must first be preached among all the nations.
041	MAR	013	011	But when they lead you to deliver you up, be not anxious beforehand, nor premeditate what you shall speak; but whatever shall be given you in that hour, that do you speak; for it is not you that speak, but the Holy Spirit.
041	MAR	013	012	Brother will deliver up brother to death, and the father the child; and children will rise up against their parents, and cause them to be put to death;
041	MAR	013	013	and you will be hated by all on my account. But he that endures to the end shall be saved.
041	MAR	013	014	But when you see that detestable thing that makes desolate, which is spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him that reads understand, ) then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains;
041	MAR	013	015	let not him that is on the house-top go down into his house, nor enter in to take any thing from his house;
041	MAR	013	016	and let not him that is in the field turn back to take his mantle.
041	MAR	013	017	But alas for those who are with child, and for those who give suck in those days.
041	MAR	013	018	And pray that your flight may not be in the winter.
041	MAR	013	019	For these will be the days of affliction, such as has not been from the beginning of the creation which God created, till this time, and will never be.
041	MAR	013	020	And unless the Lord had made those days few, no flesh could be saved: but for the sake of the elect whom he has chosen, he has made those days few.
041	MAR	013	021	And then, if any one say to you: Lo! here is the Christ, or, Lo! there; believe him not.
041	MAR	013	022	For false Christs and false prophets will arise, and will show signs and wonders, in order to lead astray, if possible, even the elect.
041	MAR	013	023	But do you take heed: behold, I have told you all things beforehand.
041	MAR	013	024	But in those days, after that affliction, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give her light,
041	MAR	013	025	and the stars of heaven will fall, and the hosts that are in the heavens will be shaken.
041	MAR	013	026	And then shall they see the Son of man coming in clouds with great power and glory.
041	MAR	013	027	And then will he send his angels, and gather his elect from the four winds, from the most distant part of earth to the most distant part of heaven.
041	MAR	013	028	But learn a parable from the fig-tree: As soon as its branch becomes tender, and puts forth leaves, you know that summer is near.
041	MAR	013	029	So, also, when you see these things coming to pass, know that it is near, at the doors.
041	MAR	013	030	Verily I say to you, this generation shall not pass away, till all these things take place.
041	MAR	013	031	Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.
041	MAR	013	032	But of that day or that hour no one knows: neither the angels who are in heaven, nor the Son, but the Father.
041	MAR	013	033	Take heed, watch and pray: for you know not when the time is.
041	MAR	013	034	As a man, going into another country, leaves his house, and gives authority to his servants, and to each one his own work, and commands the door-keeper to watch;
041	MAR	013	035	watch you therefore; for you know not when the master of the house comes, whether at evening, or at midnight, or at the crowing of the cock, or in the morning;
041	MAR	013	036	lest he come suddenly, and find you sleeping.
041	MAR	013	037	What I say to you, I say to all, Watch.
041	MAR	014	001	After two days was the passover and the feast of unleavened bread; and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him by craft, and kill him.
041	MAR	014	002	But they said: Not during the feast, lest there be a tumult of the people.
041	MAR	014	003	And while he was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, as he reclined at table, there came a woman that had an alabaster box of ointment of pure nard, very costly; and she broke the box, and poured it on his head.
041	MAR	014	004	And some of them were displeased within themselves, and said: For what purpose was this waste of the ointment?
041	MAR	014	005	For this ointment could have been sold for more than three hundred denarii, and given to the poor. And they murmured against her.
041	MAR	014	006	But Jesus said: Let her alone; why do you trouble her? She has performed a good work on me.
041	MAR	014	007	For you have the poor with you always; and whenever you choose, you can do them good; but me you have not always.
041	MAR	014	008	She has done what she could; she has come beforehand to anoint my body for its burial.
041	MAR	014	009	Verily I say to you, wherever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, this also which she has done shall be told, for a memorial of her.
041	MAR	014	010	And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went away to the chief priests, that he might deliver him up to them.
041	MAR	014	011	And when they heard it, they were glad, and promised to give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently deliver him up.
041	MAR	014	012	And on the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the passover, his disciples said to him: Where dost thou wish that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover?
041	MAR	014	013	And he sent two of his disciples, and said to them: Go into the city, and there will meet you a man carrying a pitcher of water;
041	MAR	014	014	follow him, and wherever he enters, say to the master of the house: The Teacher says, Where is the room in which I may eat the passover with my disciples?
041	MAR	014	015	And he will show you a large upper room, furnished and made ready; there make ready for us.
041	MAR	014	016	And his disciples went out, and came into the city, and found as he had said to them; and they prepared the passover.
041	MAR	014	017	And in the evening, he came with the twelve.
041	MAR	014	018	And while they were reclining at table, and were eating, Jesus said to them: Verily I say to you, One of you, he that eats with me, will deliver me up.
041	MAR	014	019	And they began to be sad, and to say to him, one by one, Is it I? and another said, Is it I?
041	MAR	014	020	He answered and said to them: It is one of the twelve, he that dips with me into the dish.
041	MAR	014	021	The Son of man goes, as it is written of him; but alas for that man by whom the Son of man is delivered up! It would have been good for that man if he had never been born.
041	MAR	014	022	And while they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and broke it, and gave it to them, and said: Take, eat; this is my body.
041	MAR	014	023	And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them; and they all drank of it.
041	MAR	014	024	And he said to them: This is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many.
041	MAR	014	025	Verily I say to you, I shall drink no more of the fruit of the vine, till that day when I shall drink it new in the kingdom of God.
041	MAR	014	026	And when they had sung a hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.
041	MAR	014	027	And Jesus said to them: All of you will find in me an occasion for offense this night; for it is written: I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered.
041	MAR	014	028	But after I have risen, I will go before you into Galilee.
041	MAR	014	029	Peter said to him: Though all should find occasion for offense, yet I will not.
041	MAR	014	030	And Jesus said to him: Verily I say to you, this day, during this very night, before the cock crows twice, you will deny me three times.
041	MAR	014	031	But he said with the more vehemence: Though it should be necessary for me to die with thee, I would not deny thee. And so said they all.
041	MAR	014	032	And they came to a place called Gethsemane; and he said to his disciples: Sit here, while I pray.
041	MAR	014	033	And he took with him Peter and James and John, and began to be in dismay and anguish of soul.
041	MAR	014	034	And he said to them: My soul is encompassed with sorrow, even to death; remain here, and watch.
041	MAR	014	035	And he went forward a little, and fell upon the ground, and prayed, that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him;
041	MAR	014	036	and he said: Abba, Father, all things are possible to thee; let this cup pass from me: but not what I will, but what thou wiliest.
041	MAR	014	037	And he came and found them sleeping; and he said to Peter: Simon, do you sleep? Had you not strength to watch one hour?
041	MAR	014	038	Watch, and pray, all of you, lest you enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.
041	MAR	014	039	And again he went away, and prayed, saying the same thing.
041	MAR	014	040	And he returned, and found them sleeping again, for their eyes were heavy; and they knew not what to answer him.
041	MAR	014	041	And he came the third time, and said to them: Sleep the remaining time, and take your rest. It is enough; the hour has come; behold, the Son of man is delivered into the hands of sinners.
041	MAR	014	042	Arise, let us go; behold, he that delivers me up draws near.
041	MAR	014	043	And immediately, while he was yet speaking, came Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude, with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.
041	MAR	014	044	And he that delivered him up had given them a sign, saying: The one that I shall kiss, is he; take him, and lead him away securely.
041	MAR	014	045	And when he came, he immediately went up to him and said: Rabbi, Rabbi, and kissed him.
041	MAR	014	046	And they laid their hands on him and took him.
041	MAR	014	047	And one of those who were standing by, drew a sword, and struck the servant of the chief priest, and cut off his ear.
041	MAR	014	048	And Jesus answering, said to them: Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs, to take me?
041	MAR	014	049	I was daily with you in the temple, and taught, and you did not take me; but this is so, that the scriptures may be fulfilled.
041	MAR	014	050	And they all forsook him and fled.
041	MAR	014	051	And there followed him a certain young man, who had a linen garment around his naked body. And the young men laid hold of him;
041	MAR	014	052	and he left the linen garment, and fled from them naked.
041	MAR	014	053	And they led Jesus away to the chief priest; and with him were assembled all the chief priests, and the elders, and the scribes.
041	MAR	014	054	And Peter followed him, at a distance, even into the palace of the chief priest, and sat with the attendants, and warmed himself at the fire.
041	MAR	014	055	And the chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin sought for testimony against Jesus, in order to put him to death, and found none.
041	MAR	014	056	For many testified falsely against him, and their testimony did not agree.
041	MAR	014	057	And some rose up, and testified falsely against him, saying:
041	MAR	014	058	We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will build another made without hands.
041	MAR	014	059	And not even in this did their testimony agree.
041	MAR	014	060	And the chief priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying: Do you make no answer? What do these testify against you?
041	MAR	014	061	But he was silent, and made no answer. Again, the chief priest asked him, and said to him: Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?
041	MAR	014	062	Jesus replied: I am. And you shall see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of the Almighty, and coming with the clouds of heaven.
041	MAR	014	063	And the chief priest rent his clothes, and said: What further need have we of witnesses?
041	MAR	014	064	You have heard his impious speech. What think you? They all condemned him to be a subject of death.
041	MAR	014	065	And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to strike him with their fists, and to say to him: Give a response. And the attendants struck him with their open hands.
041	MAR	014	066	And while Peter was in the court below, one of the maidservants of the chief priest came;
041	MAR	014	067	and when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked at him, and said: You also were with Jesus the Nazarene.
041	MAR	014	068	But he denied, saying: I neither know, nor understand what you say. And he went out into the entrance, and the cock crew.
041	MAR	014	069	And the maid-servant saw him again, and began to say to those who stood by: This man is one of them.
041	MAR	014	070	He again denied. And again, after a little while, those who stood by said to Peter: Surely, you are one of them; for you are a Galilean, and your speech is like theirs.
041	MAR	014	071	But he began to curse and to swear, saying: I know not this man of whom you speak.
041	MAR	014	072	And immediately the cock crew the second time. And Peter remembered the word that Jesus had spoken to him: Before the cock crows twice, you will deny me three times. And when he thought upon it, he wept.
041	MAR	015	001	And forthwith in the morning, the chief priests, with the elders and scribes, and the whole Sanhedrin, having held a consultation, and having bound Jesus, led him away, and delivered him to Pilate.
041	MAR	015	002	And Pilate asked him: Are you the King of the Jews? And he answering, said: You say it.
041	MAR	015	003	And the chief priests accused him of many things.
041	MAR	015	004	Pilate again asked him, saying: Do you make no answer? See, how many things they testify against you.
041	MAR	015	005	But Jesus gave no further answer; so that Pilate was astonished.
041	MAR	015	006	Now it was his custom to release to them, at the feast, one prisoner, whomever they desired.
041	MAR	015	007	And there was one called Barabbas, lying bound with his fellow-insurgents, who had committed murder in the insurrection.
041	MAR	015	008	And the multitude cried out, and began to ask him to do as he had always done for them.
041	MAR	015	009	But Pilate answered them, saying: Do you wish me to release to you the King of the Jews?
041	MAR	015	010	For he knew that, through envy, the chief priests had delivered him up.
041	MAR	015	011	But the chief priests instigated the multitude, that he should rather release Barabbas to them.
041	MAR	015	012	And Pilate answered and said again to them: What, then, do you wish me to do with him whom you call the King of the Jews?
041	MAR	015	013	They again cried out: Crucify him.
041	MAR	015	014	But Pilate said to them: Why, what evil has he done? But they cried vehemently: Crucify him.
041	MAR	015	015	And Pilate, willing to gratify the multitude, released to them Barabbas; and delivered Jesus, after he had scourged him, to be crucified.
041	MAR	015	016	And the soldiers led him away within the court, which is the governor’s house, and called together the whole band.
041	MAR	015	017	And they clothed him in purple; and having plaited a crown of thorn branches, they put it on him,
041	MAR	015	018	and began to salute him: Hail, King of the Jews!
041	MAR	015	019	And they struck him on the head with a reed, and spit upon him, and bowing their knees, did him homage.
041	MAR	015	020	And when they had derided him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.
041	MAR	015	021	And they compelled one Simon, a Cyrenian, (the father of Alexander and Rufus, ) who was passing by, coming in from the country, to bear his cross.
041	MAR	015	022	And they brought him to the place Golgotha, which is, when translated, the place of a skull.
041	MAR	015	023	And they gave him wine mingled with myrrh, to drink: but he did not receive it.
041	MAR	015	024	And when they had crucified him, they divided his clothes among themselves, casting lots for them, what each one should take.
041	MAR	015	025	And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.
041	MAR	015	026	And the superscription containing his accusation was written above him: THE KING OF THE JEWS.
041	MAR	015	027	And with him they crucified two robbers, one on his right hand, and the other on his left.
041	MAR	015	028	And the scripture was fulfilled, which says: And he was numbered with transgressors.
041	MAR	015	029	And those who passed by reviled him, shaking their heads, and saying: Aha! you that destroy the temple, and build it in three days,
041	MAR	015	030	save yourself, and come down from the cross.
041	MAR	015	031	Likewise the chief priests, with the scribes, speaking in derision one to another, said: He saved others; himself he can not save.
041	MAR	015	032	Let the Christ, the King of Israel, come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe. Those also who were crucified with him, reproached him.
041	MAR	015	033	And when the sixth hour had come, there was darkness over the whole land, till the ninth hour.
041	MAR	015	034	And at the ninth hour, Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying: Eloi, Eloi, lamma sabachthani? which is, when translated, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?
041	MAR	015	035	And some of those who stood by, when they heard it, said: Behold, he calls for Elijah.
041	MAR	015	036	And one ran, and filled a sponge with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink, saying: Wait; let us see if Elijah is coming to take him down.
041	MAR	015	037	But Jesus, having cried with a loud voice, gave up his spirit.
041	MAR	015	038	And the vail of the temple was rent in two, from the top to the bottom.
041	MAR	015	039	And when the centurion that was standing opposite him, saw that he thus cried out, and gave up his spirit, he said: Truly, this man was the Son of God.
041	MAR	015	040	And there were, at a distance, women also, looking on; among whom were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome;
041	MAR	015	041	who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered to him; and many other women, who had come up with him to Jerusalem.
041	MAR	015	042	And when the evening had come, because it was the preparation, which is the eve of the sabbath,
041	MAR	015	043	Joseph of Arimathea, an honorable counselor, who was himself looking for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus.
041	MAR	015	044	But Pilate was astonished that he was already dead; and having called the centurion to him, he inquired of him whether he had been any while dead.
041	MAR	015	045	And having learned the fact from the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.
041	MAR	015	046	And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulcher that had been hewed out of a rock: and he rolled a stone to the door of the sepulcher.
041	MAR	015	047	And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was laid.
041	MAR	016	001	And when the sabbath had passed, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, bought spices, that they might come and anoint him.
041	MAR	016	002	And very early, on the first day of the week, when the sun had risen, they came to the sepulcher.
041	MAR	016	003	And they said among themselves: Who will roll away the stone for us from the door of the sepulcher?
041	MAR	016	004	for it was very great. And looking up, they saw that the stone had been rolled away.
041	MAR	016	005	And they entered the sepulcher, and saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a white robe: and they were frightened.
041	MAR	016	006	But he said to them: Be not frightened; you seek Jesus the Nazarene, who was crucified. He has risen; he is not here: see the place where they laid him.
041	MAR	016	007	But go, tell his disciples, and Peter, that he goes before you into Galilee; there you shall see him, as he told you.
041	MAR	016	008	And they went out, and fled from the sepulcher; for trembling and astonishment seized upon them. And they said nothing to any one, for they were afraid.
041	MAR	016	009	(note: The most reliable and earliest manuscripts do not include Mark 16:9-20.) Now when Jesus had risen early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven demons.
041	MAR	016	010	And she went and told it to those who had been with him, as they mourned and wept.
041	MAR	016	011	And though they heard that he was alive, and had been seen by her, they did not believe.
041	MAR	016	012	After this he appeared in another form to two of them, as they walked and went into the country.
041	MAR	016	013	And they went and told it to the rest. But they did not believe them.
041	MAR	016	014	Afterward he appeared to the eleven as they reclined at table; and he reproached them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they did not believe those who had seen him after he had risen.
041	MAR	016	015	And he said to them: Go into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.
041	MAR	016	016	He that believes and is immersed, shall be saved; he that believes not, shall be condemned.
041	MAR	016	017	And these signs shall attend those who believe. In my name they shall cast out demons; they shall speak with new tongues;
041	MAR	016	018	they shall take up serpents; and, if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.
041	MAR	016	019	The Lord, therefore, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven: and he sat down at the right hand of God.
041	MAR	016	020	And they went forth and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with signs following.

# BOOK	042	LUK	Luke	Luke
042	LUK	001	001	Since many have undertaken to compose a history of the things that are fully believed among us,
042	LUK	001	002	even as they were delivered to us by those who were, from the beginning, eye-witnesses and ministers of the word;
042	LUK	001	003	it seemed good to me also, having obtained exact information of all things from the very first, to write them in order for you, most excellent Theophilus,
042	LUK	001	004	that you might know the certainty of the things in which you have been instructed.
042	LUK	001	005	There was, in the days of Herod the king of Judea, a certain priest, named Zachariah, of the class of Abijah; and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.
042	LUK	001	006	They were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord, blameless.
042	LUK	001	007	And they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they were both advanced in years.
042	LUK	001	008	It came to pass, while he was officiating as priest before God, in the order of his class, that,
042	LUK	001	009	according to the custom of the priest’s office, his lot was to burn incense, when he went into the temple of the Lord.
042	LUK	001	010	And all the multitude of the people were praying without, at the time of incense.
042	LUK	001	011	And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord, standing at the right side of the altar of incense.
042	LUK	001	012	And Zachariah was troubled at the sight, and fear fell upon him.
042	LUK	001	013	But the angel said to him: Fear not, Zachariah; for your prayer is heard, and your wife Elizabeth shall bear you a son, and you shall call his name John.
042	LUK	001	014	And you shall have joy and gladness, and many shall rejoice at his birth.
042	LUK	001	015	For he shall be great before the Lord; and he shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Spirit even from his mother’s womb.
042	LUK	001	016	And many of the sons of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God.
042	LUK	001	017	And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient, by the wisdom of the just, in order to make ready for the Lord a prepared people.
042	LUK	001	018	And Zachariah said to the angel: By what sign shall I know this? for I am old, and my wife is advanced in years.
042	LUK	001	019	And the angel answered and said to him: I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God; and I am sent to speak to you, and to announce to you this good news.
042	LUK	001	020	And behold, you shall be dumb and not able to speak, till the day in which these things shall take place, because you did not believe my words, which shall be fulfilled in their proper time.
042	LUK	001	021	And the people were waiting for Zachariah, and they wondered that he stayed so long in the temple.
042	LUK	001	022	But when he came out, he was not able to speak to them; and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple; and he made signs to them, and remained speechless.
042	LUK	001	023	And it came to pass, when the days of his service were completed, that he departed to his own house.
042	LUK	001	024	And after those days, his wife Elizabeth conceived, and kept herself retired for five months, saying:
042	LUK	001	025	Thus has the Lord dealt with me in the days in which he has looked with regard upon me, to take away my reproach among men.
042	LUK	001	026	And in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God into a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,
042	LUK	001	027	to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the name of the virgin was Mary.
042	LUK	001	028	And the angel came into her presence, and said: Hail, graciously accepted: the Lord is with you; blessed are you among women.
042	LUK	001	029	And she was perplexed at his words, and reasoned, what this salutation could mean.
042	LUK	001	030	And the angel said to her: Fear not, Mary; for you have found favor with God.
042	LUK	001	031	And behold, you shall conceive and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus.
042	LUK	001	032	He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give to him the throne of David his father;
042	LUK	001	033	and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there shall be no end.
042	LUK	001	034	But Mary said to the angel: How shall this be, since I know not a man?
042	LUK	001	035	And the angel answered and said to her: The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; for which reason, also, that which is begotten, being holy, shall be called the Son of God.
042	LUK	001	036	And behold, Elizabeth your kinswoman, even she has conceived a son in her old age; and this is the sixth month with her who is called barren;
042	LUK	001	037	for nothing shall be impossible with God.
042	LUK	001	038	And Mary said: Behold the handmaid of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word. And the angel departed from her.
042	LUK	001	039	And Mary arose in those days, and went with haste into the mountainous country, into a city of Judah;
042	LUK	001	040	and she came into the house of Zachariah, and saluted Elizabeth.
042	LUK	001	041	And it came to pass, when Elizabeth heard the salutation of Mary, that the babe in her womb leaped for joy.
042	LUK	001	042	And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit, and spoke with a loud voice, and said: Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb.
042	LUK	001	043	And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?
042	LUK	001	044	For, behold, when the voice of your salutation sounded in my ears, the babe in my womb leaped for joy.
042	LUK	001	045	And blessed is she who believed; for there shall be a fulfillment of the things which were spoken to her from the Lord.
042	LUK	001	046	And Mary said: My soul magnifies the Lord,
042	LUK	001	047	and my spirit rejoices in God, my Savior;
042	LUK	001	048	for he has looked upon the lowly condition of his handmaid. For, behold, from this time, all generations shall call me blessed;
042	LUK	001	049	for He that is Mighty has done great things for me, and holy is his name:
042	LUK	001	050	and his mercy is from generation to generation upon those who fear him.
042	LUK	001	051	He has done mighty deeds with his arm; he has scattered those who are proud in the understanding of their hearts.
042	LUK	001	052	He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, and exalted the lowly.
042	LUK	001	053	He has filled the hungry with good things, but the rich he has sent empty away.
042	LUK	001	054	He has helped Israel his servant, (as he spoke to our fathers, )
042	LUK	001	055	by remembering his mercy to Abraham and to his posterity forever.
042	LUK	001	056	And Mary remained with her about three months, and returned to her own house.
042	LUK	001	057	Now the time for Elizabeth to be delivered had fully come; and she gave birth to a son.
042	LUK	001	058	And her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had showed great mercy to her, and they rejoiced with her.
042	LUK	001	059	And it came to pass, on the eighth day, that they came to circumcise the child; and they called him by the name of his father, Zachariah.
042	LUK	001	060	And his mother answered and said: Not so: but he shall be called John.
042	LUK	001	061	And they said to her: There is no one among your relatives that is called by this name.
042	LUK	001	062	And they made signs to his father, to know what he wished him to be called.
042	LUK	001	063	And having asked for a writing tablet, he wrote, saying: His name is John. And they were all astonished.
042	LUK	001	064	And immediately his mouth was opened, and his tongue was loosed, and he spoke, and praised God.
042	LUK	001	065	And fear came on all that dwelt round about them; and all these things were talked of everywhere throughout the mountainous country of Judea.
042	LUK	001	066	And all that heard them, laid them up in their hearts, and said: What, then, will this child be? And the hand of the Lord was with him.
042	LUK	001	067	And Zachariah his father was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying:
042	LUK	001	068	Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for he has visited and redeemed his people;
042	LUK	001	069	and he has raised up for us, in the house of David his servant, a horn of salvation,
042	LUK	001	070	(as he spoke by the mouth of all his holy prophets of ancient times, )
042	LUK	001	071	salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us,
042	LUK	001	072	in order to show the mercy promised to our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant,
042	LUK	001	073	the oath which he swore to Abraham our father,
042	LUK	001	074	that he would grant to us, that being delivered from the hands of our enemies, we might serve him without fear,
042	LUK	001	075	in holiness and righteousness before him, all our days.
042	LUK	001	076	And you, child, shall be called the prophet of the Most High; for you shall go before the face of the Lord, to make ready his ways,
042	LUK	001	077	by giving to his people the knowledge of salvation in the remission of their sins,
042	LUK	001	078	through the tender mercies of our God; by which the dawn from on high has visited us,
042	LUK	001	079	to give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, by guiding our feet in the way of peace.
042	LUK	001	080	And the child grew and became strong in spirit; and he was in the deserts till the day of his manifestation to Israel.
042	LUK	002	001	And it came to pass in those days, that there went forth a decree from Cæsar Augustus, that all the inhabitants of the land should be enrolled.
042	LUK	002	002	This enrollment first took place when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.
042	LUK	002	003	And all went to be enrolled, each one to his own city.
042	LUK	002	004	And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, (for he was of the house and family of David, ).
042	LUK	002	005	to be enrolled with Mary his betrothed wife, who was with child.
042	LUK	002	006	And it came to pass while they were there, that the days for her to be delivered were completed;
042	LUK	002	007	and she brought forth her first-born son, and wrapped him in swathing-clothes, and laid him in the stable, because there was no place for them in the inn.
042	LUK	002	008	And there were in the same country shepherds, living in the open field, and guarding their flock by night.
042	LUK	002	009	And, behold, an angel of the Lord stood by them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them; and they were greatly afraid.
042	LUK	002	010	And the angel said to them: Be not afraid; for, behold, I bring you good news of great joy, which shall be for all people.
042	LUK	002	011	For there is born for you this day, in the city of David, a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.
042	LUK	002	012	And this shall be to you the sign: you will find the babe wrapped in swathing-clothes, and lying in a stable.
042	LUK	002	013	And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host, praising God, and saying:
042	LUK	002	014	Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will among men.
042	LUK	002	015	And it came to pass, that, after the angels had gone away into heaven, the shepherds said one to another: Let us now go to Bethlehem, and see this thing that has come to pass, which the Lord has made known to us.
042	LUK	002	016	And they came with haste, and found both Mary and Joseph, and the babe lying in the stable.
042	LUK	002	017	And after they had seen it, they made known everywhere the words that had been spoken to them of this child.
042	LUK	002	018	And all that heard, wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds.
042	LUK	002	019	But Mary kept all these things in her mind, and pondered them in her heart.
042	LUK	002	020	And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all things which they had heard and seen, as it had been told to them.
042	LUK	002	021	And when eight days were completed for circumcising him, his name was called Jesus, as it had been called by the angel, before he was conceived in the womb.
042	LUK	002	022	And when the days for their purification were completed according to the law of Moses, they brought him to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord,
042	LUK	002	023	(as it is written in the law of the Lord: Every male that opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord; )
042	LUK	002	024	and to offer a sacrifice, according to that which is commanded in the law of the Lord: A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.
042	LUK	002	025	And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon. And this man was just and devout, looking for the consolation of Israel. And the Holy Spirit was upon him:
042	LUK	002	026	and it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit, that he should not see death before he had seen the Lord’s Anointed.
042	LUK	002	027	And he came by the Spirit into the temple; and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him according to the custom of the law,
042	LUK	002	028	he took him in his arms, and blessed God, and said:
042	LUK	002	029	Now, Lord, thou dost let thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word,
042	LUK	002	030	for my eyes have seen thy salvation,
042	LUK	002	031	which thou hast prepared before the face of all people;
042	LUK	002	032	a light for a revelation to the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel.
042	LUK	002	033	And Joseph and his mother wondered at the things which were spoken of him.
042	LUK	002	034	And Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary his mother: Behold, this child is appointed for the fall and rising again of many in Israel, and for a sign to be spoken against,
042	LUK	002	035	(and a sword shall pierce through your own soul, ) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.
042	LUK	002	036	And there was a prophetess, Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher; she was of great age, and had lived with a husband seven years from her virginity:
042	LUK	002	037	and she was a widow of about eighty-four years, and she departed not from the temple, but served, day and night, with fastings and prayers.
042	LUK	002	038	And she came in at that hour, and gave thanks to Lord, and spoke of him to all that looked for redemption in Jerusalem.
042	LUK	002	039	And when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their own city Nazareth.
042	LUK	002	040	And the child grew, and became strong in spirit, being filled with wisdom; and the grace of God was upon him.
042	LUK	002	041	And his parents went up every year to Jerusalem, at the feast of passover.
042	LUK	002	042	And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem, according to the custom of the feast.
042	LUK	002	043	And when they had kept the full number of days, and had set out to return, the child Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew it not.
042	LUK	002	044	But supposing that he was in the company, they went a day’s journey; and they sought for him among their relatives and acquaintance;
042	LUK	002	045	and not finding him, they returned to Jerusalem in search of him.
042	LUK	002	046	And it came to pass, after three days, that they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both hearing them, and asking them questions.
042	LUK	002	047	And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding, and his answers.
042	LUK	002	048	And when they saw him they were amazed. And his mother said to him: Child, why have you acted thus toward us? Behold, your father and I have sought for you in sorrow.
042	LUK	002	049	And he said to them: Why did you seek for me? Did you not know that I must be in my Father’s house?
042	LUK	002	050	And they did not understand the words which he spoke to them.
042	LUK	002	051	And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was obedient to them. And his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.
042	LUK	002	052	And Jesus increased in wisdom and in stature, and in favor with God and with man.
042	LUK	003	001	In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Cæsar, when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, and Herod was tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip was tetrarch of Iturea and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias was tetrarch of Abilene,
042	LUK	003	002	Annas and Caiaphas being chief priests, the word of God came to John the son of Zachariah, in the wilderness.
042	LUK	003	003	And he came into all the country about the Jordan, preaching the immersion of repentance in order to the remission of sins;
042	LUK	003	004	as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, saying: The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make ready the way of the Lord, make his paths straight;
042	LUK	003	005	every ravine shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be made level; and the crooked ways shall be made straight; and the rough ways shall be made smooth;
042	LUK	003	006	and all flesh shall see the salvation of God.
042	LUK	003	007	Therefore he said to the multitudes that came out to be immersed by him: Generation of vipers, who has warned you to flee from the coming wrath?
042	LUK	003	008	Bring forth, therefore, fruits worthy of repentance. And begin not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham for our father; for I say to you, that God is able from these stones to raise up children for Abraham.
042	LUK	003	009	And now also the ax is lying at the root of the trees; therefore, every tree that does not produce good fruit, is cut down and cast into the fire.
042	LUK	003	010	And the multitudes asked him, saying: What, then, shall we do?
042	LUK	003	011	He answered and said to them: He that has two coats, let him give to him that has none; and he that has food, let him do likewise.
042	LUK	003	012	And the publicans also came to be immersed, and they said to him: Teacher, what shall we do?
042	LUK	003	013	And he said to them: Exact no more than that which is appointed you.
042	LUK	003	014	And soldiers also asked him, saying: And what shall we do? And he said to them: Take nothing from any one by extortion, nor by false accusation, and be content with your pay.
042	LUK	003	015	While the people were in suspense, and all were reasoning in their hearts about John, whether he was the Christ or not,
042	LUK	003	016	John answered them all, saying: I indeed immerse you in water; but there comes One mightier than I, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to loose; he will immerse you in the Holy Spirit and in fire.
042	LUK	003	017	His winnowing shovel is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his thrashing-floor, and gather the grain into his granary, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.
042	LUK	003	018	With many other exhortations he proclaimed the good news to the people.
042	LUK	003	019	But Herod the tetrarch having been reproved by him on account of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip, and for all the wicked deeds which Herod did,
042	LUK	003	020	added this also to them all, that he shut up John in prison.
042	LUK	003	021	And it came to pass, while all the people were being immersed, that Jesus also was immersed; and as he was praying, the heaven was opened,
042	LUK	003	022	and the Holy Spirit descended upon him, in a bodily form, like a dove; and there came a voice from heaven, which said: Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I delight.
042	LUK	003	023	And Jesus was about thirty years old when he began his ministry, being, as was supposed, the son of Joseph, son of Heli,
042	LUK	003	024	son of Matthat, son of Levi, son of Malchi, son of Janna, son of Joseph,
042	LUK	003	025	son of Mattathiah, son of Amos, son of Nahum, son of Esli, son of Naggæ,
042	LUK	003	026	son of Maath, son of Mattathiah, son of Shimoi, son of Joseph, son of Judah,
042	LUK	003	027	son of Joannah, son of Rhesa, son of Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel, son of Neri,
042	LUK	003	028	son of Malchi, son of Addi, son of Kosam, son of Elmodam, son of Er,
042	LUK	003	029	son of Jose, son of Eliezer, son of Jorim, son of Matthat, son of Levi,
042	LUK	003	030	son of Simeon, son of Judah, son of Joseph, son of Jonan, son of Eliakim,
042	LUK	003	031	son of Meleah, son of Mainan, son of Mattatha, son of Nathan, son of David,
042	LUK	003	032	Son of Jesse, son of Obed, son of Boaz, son of Salmon, son of Nahshon,
042	LUK	003	033	son of Aminidab, son of Aram, son of Esrom, son of Phares, son of Judah,
042	LUK	003	034	son of Jacob, son of Isaac, son of Abraham, son of Terah, son of Nahor,
042	LUK	003	035	son of Serug, son of Reu, son of Peleg, son of Eber, son of Salah,
042	LUK	003	036	son of Kenan, son of Arphaxad, son of Shem, son of Noah, son of Lamech,
042	LUK	003	037	son of Methusalah, son of Enoch, son of Jared, son of Mahalaleel, son of Kenan,
042	LUK	003	038	son of Enos, son of Seth, son of Adam, son of God.
042	LUK	004	001	And Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness,
042	LUK	004	002	and was there forty days, to be tempted by the devil. And he ate nothing during those days; and when they were ended, he was afterward hungry.
042	LUK	004	003	And the devil said to him: If you are the Son of God, command this stone to become bread.
042	LUK	004	004	And Jesus answered him, and said: It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.
042	LUK	004	005	And the devil took him up into a high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world, in a moment of time.
042	LUK	004	006	And the devil said to him: I will give you all the authority and glory of these, for it is delivered to me; and to whomever I will, I give it.
042	LUK	004	007	If, therefore, you will bow with reverence before me, all shall be yours.
042	LUK	004	008	And Jesus answered and said to him: Get behind me, Satan; it is written, You shall worship the Lord your God, and him only shall you serve.
042	LUK	004	009	And he brought him to Jerusalem, and placed him on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to him: If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from this place;
042	LUK	004	010	for it is written, He will give his angels charge concerning you, to guard you carefully;
042	LUK	004	011	and in their hands they shall take you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone.
042	LUK	004	012	And Jesus answered and said to him: It is said, You shall not put the Lord your God to the proof.
042	LUK	004	013	And when the devil had ended all the temptation, he departed from him for a time.
042	LUK	004	014	And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee: and his fame went throughout the whole of that region.
042	LUK	004	015	And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified by all.
042	LUK	004	016	And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up; and, as his custom was, he entered the synagogue on the sabbath-day, and stood up to read.
042	LUK	004	017	And the volume of Isaiah the prophet was given to him: and when he had unrolled the volume, he found the place where it was written:
042	LUK	004	018	The Spirit of the Lord is upon me; because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted; to proclaim liberty to the captives, and recovery of sight to the blind; to set free the oppressed;
042	LUK	004	019	to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.
042	LUK	004	020	And he rolled up the volume, and save it back to the attendant, and sat down; and the eyes of all that were in the synagogue were earnestly fixed upon him.
042	LUK	004	021	And he began to say to them: This scripture which you have heard, is this day fulfilled.
042	LUK	004	022	And all extolled him; and they wondered at the words of grace which proceeded out of his mouth, and said: Is not this the son of Joseph?
042	LUK	004	023	And he said to them: You will assuredly apply to me this proverb, Physician, heal yourself. Whatever things we have heard were done in Capernaum, do also here in your country.
042	LUK	004	024	And he said: Verily I say to you, No prophet is accepted in his own country.
042	LUK	004	025	And I tell you, in truth, there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the heaven was shut up for three years and six months, so that a great famine was on all the land:
042	LUK	004	026	and to no one of them was Elijah sent, but to Sarepta, a city of Sidon, to a woman that was a widow.
042	LUK	004	027	And many lepers were in Israel, in the time of Elisha the prophet; and no one of them was cleansed but Naaman the Syrian.
042	LUK	004	028	And all that were in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were filled with anger,
042	LUK	004	029	and arose, and drove him out of the city, and brought him to the brow of the hill on which their city was built, that they might throw him down headlong.
042	LUK	004	030	But he passed through the midst of them, and went away.
042	LUK	004	031	And he went down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee. And he was teaching them on the sabbath-days.
042	LUK	004	032	And they were astonished at his teaching, for his word was with authority.
042	LUK	004	033	And there was in the synagogue a man who had the spirit of an unclean demon; and he cried out with a loud voice,
042	LUK	004	034	saying: Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, Jesus, thou Nazarene? Hast thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.
042	LUK	004	035	And Jesus rebuked him, saying: Be silent, and come out of him. And the demon threw him into the midst, and came out of him, and hurt him not.
042	LUK	004	036	And amazement came upon all, and they spoke one to another, saying: What teaching is this? for with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits, and they come out.
042	LUK	004	037	And his fame went abroad into every place of the country round about.
042	LUK	004	038	And he arose and went out of the synagogue into the house of Simon. And Simon’s mother-in-law was confined with a violent fever: and they besought him in her behalf.
042	LUK	004	039	And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever, and it left her: and she arose immediately, and ministered to them.
042	LUK	004	040	And when the sun had gone down, all that had any sick with various diseases, brought them to him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and cured them.
042	LUK	004	041	Demons also came out of many, crying out and saying: Thou art the Christ, the Son of God. And he rebuked them, and did not permit them to speak, because they knew that he was the Christ.
042	LUK	004	042	And when it was day, he went out and departed into a desert place; and the multitudes sought for him, and came to him and endeavored to detain him, that he should not go away from them.
042	LUK	004	043	But he said to them: I must make known the good news of the kingdom of God to other cities also; for to this end I have been sent.
042	LUK	004	044	And he continued to preach in the synagogues of Galilee.
042	LUK	005	001	And it came to pass while the multitude was pressing on him to hear the word of God, and he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret,
042	LUK	005	002	that he saw two ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen had gone out of them, and were washing their nets.
042	LUK	005	003	And he entered one of the ships, which was Simon’s, and requested him to push out a little from the land. And he sat down and taught the multitude from the ship.
042	LUK	005	004	And when he had made an end of speaking, he said to Simon: Push out into the deep water, and let down your nets for a draught.
042	LUK	005	005	And Simon answered and said to him: Master, we have toiled all night and have caught nothing; but at thy command, I will let down the net.
042	LUK	005	006	And when they had done this, they inclosed a great number of fishes, and their net began to break;
042	LUK	005	007	and they beckoned to their partners who were in the other ship, to come and help them. And they came and filled both the ships, so that they began to sink.
042	LUK	005	008	And when Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at the knees of Jesus, and said: Depart from me, Lord, for I am a sinful man.
042	LUK	005	009	For amazement at the draught of fishes which they had caught had seized upon him and all that were with him;
042	LUK	005	010	and in like manner also upon James and John the sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon: Fear not; from this time forth you shall catch men.
042	LUK	005	011	And when they had brought their ships to the land, they left all and followed him.
042	LUK	005	012	And it came to pass, that he was in one of their cities; and behold, a man full of leprosy; and when he saw Jesus, he fell on his face and besought him, saying: Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.
042	LUK	005	013	And stretching out his hand, he touched him, and said: I will; be clean. And immediately his leprosy departed from him.
042	LUK	005	014	And he charged him to tell no one; but go, show yourself to the priest, and make offering for your cleansing, as Moses commanded, that it may be a testimony to them.
042	LUK	005	015	But his fame went abroad the more; and many multitudes came together to hear, and to be cured by him of their infirmities.
042	LUK	005	016	And he withdrew to the deserts and prayed.
042	LUK	005	017	And it came to pass, on a certain day, that he was teaching, and there were Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting by, who had come from every village of Galilee and Judea and Jerusalem; and the power of the Lord was exerted to heal them.
042	LUK	005	018	And behold, men brought, on a bed, a man who was a paralytic. And they sought how they might bring him in, and lay him before him.
042	LUK	005	019	And finding no way by which they could bring him in, because of the multitude, they went up on the top of the house, and, through the tiling, let him down, with his bed, into the midst before Jesus.
042	LUK	005	020	And when he saw their faith, he said to him: Man, your sins are forgiven you.
042	LUK	005	021	And the scribes and Pharisees began to reason, saying: Who is this that utters impious words? Who can forgive sins but God alone?
042	LUK	005	022	But Jesus perceived their reasonings, and answered and said to them: Why are you reasoning in your hearts?
042	LUK	005	023	Which is easier, to say., Your sins are forgiven you; or to say, Arise and walk?
042	LUK	005	024	But that you may know that the Son of man on the earth has power to forgive sins, (he said to the paralytic, ) I say to you, Arise, and take up your bed, and go to your house.
042	LUK	005	025	And he immediately arose before them, took up that on which he had been lying, and went away to his own house, glorifying God.
042	LUK	005	026	And astonishment seized upon all, and they glorified God, and were filled with fear, saying: We have seen strange things to-day.
042	LUK	005	027	And after these tilings, he went out and saw a publican named Levi, sitting at the custom-house; and he said to him: Follow me.
042	LUK	005	028	And leaving all, he arose and followed him.
042	LUK	005	029	And Levi made him a great feast at his own house; and there was a great multitude of publicans and others, who reclined at table with them.
042	LUK	005	030	And their scribes and the Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying: Why do you eat and drink with publicans and sinners?
042	LUK	005	031	And Jesus answered arid said to them: They that are well have no need of a physician, but they that are sick.
042	LUK	005	032	I have not come to call righteous men, but sinners, to repentance.
042	LUK	005	033	And they said to him: Why do the disciples of John fast often, and make prayers, and likewise the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours eat and drink?
042	LUK	005	034	And he said to them: Can you make the sons of the bride-chamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them?
042	LUK	005	035	But the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken from them; then shall they fast in those days.
042	LUK	005	036	And he spoke also a parable to them: No one patches an old garment with a piece taken from a new garment. If so, the new tears it, and the patch from the new suits not the old.
042	LUK	005	037	And no one puts new wine into old bottles; if so, the new wine will burst the bottles, and it will be spilled, and the bottles will be destroyed.
042	LUK	005	038	But new wine must be put into new bottles, and both will be preserved.
042	LUK	005	039	And no one, after drinking old wine, immediately desires new; for he says: The old is better.
042	LUK	006	001	And it came to pass, on the first sabbath after the second day of the feast, that he was going through the fields of grain; and his disciples pulled the ears and ate, rubbing them in their hands.
042	LUK	006	002	And some of the Pharisees said to them: Why are you doing what it is not lawful to do on the sabbath-days?
042	LUK	006	003	And Jesus answered and said to them: Have you not read even that which David did, when he was hungry himself, and those who were with him,
042	LUK	006	004	that he entered the house of God, and took the loaves of the presence, and ate, and gave to those also who were with him, which it is not lawful, except for the priests alone, to eat?
042	LUK	006	005	And he said to them: The Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.
042	LUK	006	006	And it came to pass, on another sabbath, that he entered the synagogue and taught; and a man was there, whose right hand was withered.
042	LUK	006	007	And the scribes and Pharisees watched closely, whether he would heal on the sabbath-day, that they might find an accusation against him.
042	LUK	006	008	But he knew their thoughts; and he said to the man that had the withered hand: Rise, and stand forth in the midst. And he arose, and stood.
042	LUK	006	009	Then Jesus said to them, I will ask you a question: Which is lawful on the sabbath, to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or to kill?
042	LUK	006	010	And looking round upon them all, he said to him: Stretch forth your hand. And he did so; and his hand was restored like the other.
042	LUK	006	011	But they were filled with madness, and began to consult with one another what they should do to Jesus.
042	LUK	006	012	And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into the mountain to pray; and he spent the night in prayer to God.
042	LUK	006	013	And when it was day, he called to him his disciples; and from them he chose twelve, whom he also named apostles:
042	LUK	006	014	Simon, whom he also named Peter, and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew,
042	LUK	006	015	Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alphæus, and Simon who is called Zelotes,
042	LUK	006	016	Judas the brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, who was also the traitor.
042	LUK	006	017	And he came down with them, and stood in a plain; and with him stood a multitude of his disciples, and a great number of people from all Judea and Jerusalem, and the sea-coast of Tyre and Sidon, who had come to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases,
042	LUK	006	018	and those who were oppressed by evil spirits; and they were cured.
042	LUK	006	019	And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for power went forth from him, and healed them all.
042	LUK	006	020	And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said: Blessed are you that are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.
042	LUK	006	021	Blessed are you that hunger now, for you shall be satisfied. Blessed are you that weep now, for you shall laugh.
042	LUK	006	022	Blessed are you when men shall hate you, and shall withdraw themselves from you, and reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, on account of the Son of man.
042	LUK	006	023	Rejoice in that day, and leap for joy; for behold, your reward is great in heaven: for so did their fathers to the prophets.
042	LUK	006	024	But alas for you that are rich! for you have received your consolation.
042	LUK	006	025	Alas for you that are full! for you shall be hungry. Alas for you that laugh now! for you shall mourn and weep.
042	LUK	006	026	Alas for you, when men shall speak well of you! for so did their fathers to the false prophets.
042	LUK	006	027	But I say to you that hear: Love your enemies; do good to them that hate you;
042	LUK	006	028	bless them that curse you; pray for them that abuse you.
042	LUK	006	029	To him that strikes you on one cheek, offer also the other; and from him that takes away your mantle, withhold not your coat.
042	LUK	006	030	Give to every one that asks of you; and of him that takes away your goods, ask them not again.
042	LUK	006	031	And as you would that men should do to you, do you also in like manner to them.
042	LUK	006	032	And if you love them that love you, what thanks have you? for even sinners love those who love them.
042	LUK	006	033	And if you do good to them that do good to you, what thanks have you? for even sinners do the same.
042	LUK	006	034	And if you lend to them from whom you hope to receive, what thanks have you? for even sinners lend to sinners, that they may receive the same.
042	LUK	006	035	But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing in return; and your reward shall be great, and you shall be sons of the Most High: for he is kind to the unthankful and the evil.
042	LUK	006	036	Be you, therefore, merciful, as your Father also is merciful.
042	LUK	006	037	Judge not, and you shall not be judged; condemn not, and you shall not be condemned. Forgive, and you shall be forgiven.
042	LUK	006	038	Give, and it shall be given to you; good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your lap. For with the same measure with which you measure, it shall be measured to you in return.
042	LUK	006	039	And he spoke a parable to them: Can the blind lead the blind? Will not both fall into the pit?
042	LUK	006	040	The disciple is not above his teacher; but every accomplished disciple shall be as his teacher.
042	LUK	006	041	And why do you look at the splinter that is in your brother’s eye, but perceive not the beam that is in your own eye?
042	LUK	006	042	Or, how can you say to your brother: Brother, let me pull out the splinter that is in your eye, when you yourself see not the beam that is in your own eye? Hypocrite, first pull the beam out of your own eye, and then you shall see clearly to pull out the splinter that is in your brother’s eye.
042	LUK	006	043	For a good tree does not produce unsound fruit; nor does an unsound tree produce good fruit.
042	LUK	006	044	For every tree is known by its own fruit. For figs are not gathered from thorns, nor are grapes gathered from brambles.
042	LUK	006	045	The good man, out of the good treasury of his heart, brings forth that which is good; and the evil man, out of the evil treasury of his heart, brings forth that which is evil. For out of the abundance of his heart his mouth speaks.
042	LUK	006	046	But why call me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I command?
042	LUK	006	047	Every one that comes to me, and hears my words, and does them, I will show you to whom he is like.
042	LUK	006	048	He is like a man that, when building a house, digged deep, and laid the foundation on the rock. And when a flood arose, the torrent dashed against that house, and it was not able to shake it, for it was founded on the rock.
042	LUK	006	049	But he that hears, and does not, is like a man that built a house upon the earth, without a foundation, against which the torrent dashed with violence, and immediately it fell, and the ruin of that house was great.
042	LUK	007	001	And when he had ended all his sayings in the hearing of the people, he went into Capernaum.
042	LUK	007	002	And a certain centurion’s servant, who was dear to him, was sick, and about to die.
042	LUK	007	003	But when he heard of Jesus, he sent to him elders of the Jews, and besought him to come and save his servant.
042	LUK	007	004	And they came to Jesus, and besought him earnestly, saying: He is worthy for whom thou shouldst do this;
042	LUK	007	005	for he loves our nation, and of his own accord has built us a synagogue.
042	LUK	007	006	And Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, and said to him: Lord, give thyself no trouble; for I am not worthy that thou shouldst come under my roof.
042	LUK	007	007	For which reason, neither did I count myself worthy to go to thee; but command in a word, and my servant shall be healed.
042	LUK	007	008	For I am a man placed under authority, and have soldiers under me; and I say to this one, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and he does it.
042	LUK	007	009	And when Jesus heard these things, he was filled with admiration for him; and, turning to the multitude that followed, he said: I say to you, Not even in Israel have I found so great faith.
042	LUK	007	010	And they that had been sent, returned to the house, and found the servant that had been sick restored to health.
042	LUK	007	011	And it came to pass, the next day, that he was going to a city called Nain; and many of his disciples and a great multitude followed him.
042	LUK	007	012	And when he came near the gate of tho city, behold, they were carrying out a dead man, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow; and a great multitude from the city was with her.
042	LUK	007	013	And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said to her: Weep not.
042	LUK	007	014	And he went and touched the bier; and those who were carrying it, stood still. And he said: Young man, I say to you, Arise.
042	LUK	007	015	And he that had been dead, sat up and began to speak; and he gave him to his mother.
042	LUK	007	016	And fear seized on all; and they glorified God, saying: A great prophet has arisen among us; and, God has visited his people.
042	LUK	007	017	And this report concerning him went abroad into all Judea and all the neighboring region.
042	LUK	007	018	And the disciples of John told him of all these things.
042	LUK	007	019	And John called to him two of his disciples, and sent them to Jesus, and said: Art thou he that was to come, or must we look for another?
042	LUK	007	020	And the men came to him and said: John the Immerser has sent us to thee, and says, Art thou he that was to come, or must we look for another?
042	LUK	007	021	And in that very hour he cured many of diseases and plagues and evil spirits, and bestowed sight on many that were blind.
042	LUK	007	022	And Jesus answered and said to them: Go and tell John what you have seen and heard; that the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, the poor have the gospel preached to them;
042	LUK	007	023	and blessed is he who shall find no cause of offense in me.
042	LUK	007	024	And when the messengers of John had departed, he began to say to the multitudes concerning John: What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?
042	LUK	007	025	But what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they that wear splendid apparel, and live in luxury, are in kings houses.
042	LUK	007	026	But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I say to you, and much more than a prophet.
042	LUK	007	027	This is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee.
042	LUK	007	028	For I say to you, Among those born of women, there is no prophet greater than John the Immerser. But the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
042	LUK	007	029	And all the people, and the publicans that heard him, vindicated God, by being immersed with the immersion of John;
042	LUK	007	030	but the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the counsel of God in regard to themselves, by not being immersed by him.
042	LUK	007	031	To what, then, shall I compare the men of this generation? and to what are they like?
042	LUK	007	032	They are like children sitting in the market-place, who call to one another, and say, We have played on the pipe for you, and you have not danced; we have sung mournful songs for you, and you have not lamented.
042	LUK	007	033	For John the Immerser came, neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, He has a demon.
042	LUK	007	034	The Son of man has come, eating and drinking, and you say, Behold, a gluttonous man and a drinker of wine, a friend of publicans and sinners.
042	LUK	007	035	Yet wisdom is vindicated by all her children.
042	LUK	007	036	And one of the Pharisees invited him to eat with him. And he went into the house of the Pharisee, and reclined at table.
042	LUK	007	037	And, behold, a woman of the city, who was a sinner, when she knew that he reclined at table in the house of the Pharisee, brought an alabaster box of ointment,
042	LUK	007	038	and stood behind at his feet, weeping; and she began to wash his feet with her tears; and she wiped them with the hair of her head, and kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointment.
042	LUK	007	039	But when the Pharisee who had invited him, saw it, he said within himself: This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who, and what sort of woman this is that touches him; for she is a sinner.
042	LUK	007	040	And Jesus answered and said to him: Simon, I have something to say to you. He replied: Teacher, say on.
042	LUK	007	041	A certain creditor had two debtors; the one owed him five hundred denarii, the other, fifty.
042	LUK	007	042	But as they had nothing to pay, he forgave them both. Which of them, then, will love him the more?
042	LUK	007	043	Simon answered and said: I suppose he to whom he forgave the more. He said to him: You have decided correctly.
042	LUK	007	044	And turning toward the woman, he said to Simon: Do you see this woman? I entered your house, you gave me no water for my feet; but she has washed my feet with her tears, and wiped them with her hair.
042	LUK	007	045	You gave me no kiss; but she, from the time I came in, has not ceased to kiss my feet.
042	LUK	007	046	You did not anoint my head with oil; but she has anointed my feet with ointment.
042	LUK	007	047	Wherefore, I say to you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much. But he to whom little is forgiven, loves little.
042	LUK	007	048	And he said to her: Your sins are forgiven.
042	LUK	007	049	And those who reclined at table with him began to say within themselves: Who is this that also forgives sins?
042	LUK	007	050	But he said to the woman: Your faith has saved you; go in peace.
042	LUK	008	001	And it came to pass afterward, that he went through every city and village, preaching, and making known the good news of the kingdom of God; and the twelve were with him;
042	LUK	008	002	and also certain women that had been cured of evil spirits and diseases; Mary, called Magdalene, out of whom had gone seven demons,
042	LUK	008	003	and Joanna, the wife of Chuza, Herod’s steward, and Susanna, and many others, who ministered to him from their means.
042	LUK	008	004	And when a great multitude had assembled, and they were coming to him from every city, he spoke by a parable:
042	LUK	008	005	The sower went forth to sow his seed; and as he sowed, some fell by the wayside, and it was trodden down, and the birds of the air ate it up.
042	LUK	008	006	And some fell upon the rock; and when it had sprung up, it withered, because it had no moisture.
042	LUK	008	007	And some fell in the midst of thorns; and the thorns grew up with it and choked it.
042	LUK	008	008	And other seed fell into good ground, and sprung up, and produced fruit a hundred-fold. When he had said these things, he cried: He that has ears to hear, let him hear.
042	LUK	008	009	And the disciples asked him, saying: What does this parable mean?
042	LUK	008	010	He replied: To you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that when they see, they may not see, and when they hear, they may not understand.
042	LUK	008	011	But the meaning of the parable is this: The seed is the word of God;
042	LUK	008	012	those by the wayside are they that hear; then comes the devil and takes the word from their heart, lest they should believe and be saved.
042	LUK	008	013	Those on the rock are they that, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, who, for awhile, believe, and in time of temptation apostatize.
042	LUK	008	014	That which fell among thorns are those who hear, and so conduct themselves, that they are choked by the cares and riches and pleasures of life, and bring no fruit to perfection.
042	LUK	008	015	But that on the good ground are those who, in a good and honest heart, hear the word, and keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience.
042	LUK	008	016	No one when he has lighted a lamp, covers it with a vessel, or puts it under a divan, but sets it on a lamp-stand, that they who come in may see the light.
042	LUK	008	017	For there is nothing concealed, that shall not be made manifest, nor hid, that shall not be known and brought into view.
042	LUK	008	018	Take heed, therefore, how you hear; for whoever has, to him shall be given; and whoever has not, even that which he seems to have shall be taken from him.
042	LUK	008	019	And his mother and his brothers came to him, but were not able to get near him on account of the multitude.
042	LUK	008	020	And it was told him by some that said: Thy mother and thy brothers stand without, desiring to see thee.
042	LUK	008	021	But he answered and said to them: My mother and my brothers are they that hear the word of God and do it.
042	LUK	008	022	And it came to pass, on a certain day, that he entered a ship with his disciples; and he said to them: Let us go over to the other side of the lake. And they set sail.
042	LUK	008	023	And while they were sailing, he fell asleep. And a storm of wind came down upon the lake, and they began to be filled, and were in danger.
042	LUK	008	024	And they came to him, and awoke him, saying: Master, master, we perish. But he arose and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water, and they ceased, and there was a calm.
042	LUK	008	025	And he said to them: Where is your faith? And being afraid, they wondered, and said one to another: Who, then, is this, that he commands even the wind and the water, and they obey him?
042	LUK	008	026	And they sailed to the country of the Gadarenes, which is opposite to Galilee.
042	LUK	008	027	And when he came out upon the land, there met him a certain man from the city, who had been possessed with demons for a long time, and who wore no clothes, and dwelt in no house, but in the tombs.
042	LUK	008	028	When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and said with a loud voice: What have I to do with thee, Jesus, Son of God Most High? I beseech thee, torment me not.
042	LUK	008	029	For he had O; commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For it had often seized upon him, and he had been bound with chains and fetters, and kept in confinement; and he broke the bonds, and was driven by the demon into the deserts.
042	LUK	008	030	And Jesus asked him, saying: What is your name? He answered, Legion; for many demons had entered into him.
042	LUK	008	031	And they be sought him, that he would not command them to go away into the abyss.
042	LUK	008	032	And there was in that place a herd of many swine feeding on the mountain. And they besought him to permit them to go into them. And he permitted them.
042	LUK	008	033	And the demons came out of the man, and went into the swine; and the herd rushed down a steep place into the lake, and were drowned.
042	LUK	008	034	And when those who fed them saw what was done, they fled, and told it in the city and in the country.
042	LUK	008	035	And they came out to see what had been done; and they came to Jesus, and saw the man out of whom the demons had gone, clothed, and in his right mind, sitting at the feet of Jesus; and they were afraid.
042	LUK	008	036	And those who had seen it, told them by what means the man who had been possessed with the demons, was saved.
042	LUK	008	037	And the whole multitude of the neighboring country of the Gadarenes besought him to depart from them; for they were seized with great fear. And he entered the ship and returned.
042	LUK	008	038	And the man out of whom the demons had gone, besought him that he might be with him. But Jesus sent him away, saying:
042	LUK	008	039	Return to your house, and tell what things God has done for you. And he went away, proclaiming through the whole city what Jesus had done for him.
042	LUK	008	040	And it came to pass, when Jesus returned, that the multitude received him gladly; for they were all waiting for him.
042	LUK	008	041	And, behold, there came a man, whose name was Jairus; and he was a ruler of the synagogue; and he fell down at the feet of Jesus, and besought him to come into his house;
042	LUK	008	042	for he had a daughter, his only child, about twelve years of age, and she was dying. And as he went, the multitude pressed upon him.
042	LUK	008	043	And a woman that had been afflicted with an issue of blood for twelve years, who had spent her whole living upon physicians, and could be cured by no one,
042	LUK	008	044	came behind, and touched the fringe of his mantle; and her issue of blood immediately ceased.
042	LUK	008	045	And Jesus said: Who touched me? When they all denied, Peter and those with him said: Master, the multitudes press upon thee, and throng thee, and dost thou say, Who touched me?
042	LUK	008	046	But Jesus said: Some one touched me; for I perceive that power has gone forth from me.
042	LUK	008	047	And the woman, seeing that she had not escaped notice, came trembling, and fell down before him, and told him, before all the people, for what cause she had touched him, and that she was immediately restored to health.
042	LUK	008	048	And he said to her: Take courage, daughter; your faith has saved you; go in peace.
042	LUK	008	049	While he was yet speaking, there came some one from the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and said to him: Your daughter is dead; trouble not the Teacher.
042	LUK	008	050	But when Jesus heard it, he answered him, saying: Fear not, only believe, and she shall be saved.
042	LUK	008	051	And when he came to the house, he permitted no one to go in but Peter and James and John, and the father and the mother of the child.
042	LUK	008	052	And all were weeping and lamenting her. But he said: Weep not; she is not dead, but sleeps.
042	LUK	008	053	And they derided him, knowing that she was dead.
042	LUK	008	054	But he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called, and said: Child, arise.
042	LUK	008	055	And her spirit returned, and she arose immediately. And he commanded that food should be given her.
042	LUK	008	056	And her parents were amazed. But he charged them to tell no one what had been done.
042	LUK	009	001	And he called his twelve disciples to him, and gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases:
042	LUK	009	002	and he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick.
042	LUK	009	003	And he said to them: Take nothing for your journey, neither staff, nor bag, nor bread, nor money; nor have two coats each.
042	LUK	009	004	And whatever house you enter, there remain, and thence depart.
042	LUK	009	005	And whoever will not receive you, when you go out of that city, shake off even the dust from your feet, for a testimony against them.
042	LUK	009	006	And they departed, and went through every village, preaching the gospel, and performing cures everywhere.
042	LUK	009	007	And Herod the tetrarch heard of all things that were done by him; and he was perplexed, because it was said by some, that John had risen from the dead;
042	LUK	009	008	and by some, that Elijah had appeared; and by others, that a prophet of ancient times had risen again.
042	LUK	009	009	And Herod said: John I have beheaded: but who is this, of whom I hear such things? And he desired to see him.
042	LUK	009	010	And the apostles returned, and told him all that they had done. And he took them, and withdrew privately to a desert place, that belonged to a city called Bethsaida.
042	LUK	009	011	But the multitudes knew it, and followed him; and he received them, and spoke to them of the kingdom of God, and healed those who had need of healing.
042	LUK	009	012	And the day began to decline; and the twelve came and said to him: Send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and the country round about, and lodge, and find food; for we are here in a desert place.
042	LUK	009	013	But he said to them: Do you give them food. They replied: We have nothing but five loaves and two fishes, unless we go and buy food for all these people.
042	LUK	009	014	For there were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples: Make them recline in companies of fifty.
042	LUK	009	015	And they did so, and made them all recline.
042	LUK	009	016	And he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and broke, and gave them to the disciples, to set before the multitude.
042	LUK	009	017	And they all ate, and were satisfied; and there was taken up what remained to them of the broken pieces, twelve baskets.
042	LUK	009	018	And it came to pass, as he was praying in a retired place, that his disciples were with him; and he asked them, saying: Who do the multitudes say that I am?
042	LUK	009	019	They answered and said: John the Immerser; but some, Elijah; and others, that some prophet of ancient times has risen again.
042	LUK	009	020	He said to them: But who do you say that I am? Peter answered and said: The Christ of God.
042	LUK	009	021	And he strictly charged them and commanded them to tell this to no one,
042	LUK	009	022	saying: The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be put to death, and be raised the third day.
042	LUK	009	023	And he said to them all: If any one determines to come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.
042	LUK	009	024	For whoever will save his life, shall lose it; but whoever will lose his life for my sake, shall save it.
042	LUK	009	025	For what will it profit a man, if he gain the whole world, and destroy himself, or be lost?
042	LUK	009	026	For whoever will be ashamed of me and my words, of him will the Son of man be ashamed, when he comes in his own glory; and that of the Father, and of the holy angels.
042	LUK	009	027	But I say to you, of a truth, there are some of these who stand here that shall not taste of death till they see the kingdom of God.
042	LUK	009	028	And it came to pass, about eight days after these words, that he took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to pray.
042	LUK	009	029	And as he prayed, the appearance of his face was changed, and his raiment became white and glittering.
042	LUK	009	030	And, behold, two men conversed with him, who were Moses and Elijah;
042	LUK	009	031	they appeared in glory, and spoke of his departure, which he was about to accomplish in Jerusalem.
042	LUK	009	032	And Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep; but having fully awakened, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him.
042	LUK	009	033	And it came to pass, that, as they were withdrawing from him, Peter said to Jesus: Master, it is good for us to be here; let us make three tents, one for thee, one for Moses, and one for. Elijah, not knowing what he said.
042	LUK	009	034	While he was saying these things, there came a cloud, and it overshadowed them; and they were afraid as those men entered the cloud.
042	LUK	009	035	And there came a voice from the cloud, saying: This is my beloved Son; hear him.
042	LUK	009	036	And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And they kept it secret, and told no one, in those days, any of the things which they had seen.
042	LUK	009	037	And it came to pass, that, on the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, a great multitude met him.
042	LUK	009	038	And, behold, a man from the multitude cried out, saying: Teacher, I beseech thee, look upon my son, for he is my only child;
042	LUK	009	039	and, behold, a spirit seizes him, and he suddenly cries out, and it throws him into convulsions, and causes him to foam, and after depriving him of strength, hardly departs from him.
042	LUK	009	040	And I entreated thy disciples to cast it out; but they were not able.
042	LUK	009	041	And Jesus answering, said: O unbelieving and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you and bear with you! Bring your son hither.
042	LUK	009	042	And while he was coming, the demon cast him to the ground, and threw him into convulsions; but Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and restored the child to health, and gave him back to his father.
042	LUK	009	043	And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. And while they were all wondering at every thing that Jesus did, he said to his disciples:
042	LUK	009	044	Let these words sink into your ears; for the Son of man is about to be delivered into the hands of men.
042	LUK	009	045	But they did not understand this saying, and it was concealed from them, that they might not understand it; and they were afraid to ask him about this saying.
042	LUK	009	046	And there arose a contention among them, which of them should be greatest.
042	LUK	009	047	But Jesus perceived the thought of their heart, and he took a little child, and made it stand by him,
042	LUK	009	048	and said to them: Whoever will receive this little child on my account, receives me; and whoever will receive me, receives him that sent me. For he that is least among you all, the same shall be great.
042	LUK	009	049	And John answered and said: Master, we saw a certain one casting out demons in thy name; and we forbade him, because he does not follow with us.
042	LUK	009	050	And Jesus said to him: Forbid him not; for whoever is not against us, is for us.
042	LUK	009	051	And it came to pass, as the time for him to be taken up into heaven had fully come, that he set his face steadfastly to go up to Jerusalem.
042	LUK	009	052	And he sent messengers before his face; and they went, and entered a village of the Samaritans, to prepare for him.
042	LUK	009	053	And they did not receive him, because his face was turned toward Jerusalem.
042	LUK	009	054	And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said: Lord, is it thy will that we command fire to come down from heaven and destroy them, even as Elijah did?
042	LUK	009	055	But he turned and rebuked them, and said: You know not of what spirit you are.
042	LUK	009	056	And they went to another village.
042	LUK	009	057	And it came to pass, as they were going on their journey, that a certain man said to him: Lord, I will follow thee wherever thou shalt go.
042	LUK	009	058	And Jesus said to him: The foxes have dens, and the birds of the air have roosts, but the Son of man has not where to lay his head.
042	LUK	009	059	And he said to another: Follow me. But he replied: Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father.
042	LUK	009	060	Jesus said: Let the dead bury their own dead; but do you go and publish abroad the kingdom of God.
042	LUK	009	061	And another said: I will follow thee, Lord; but first permit me to take leave of those at home.
042	LUK	009	062	Jesus said to him: No one that puts his hand to the plow, and looks back, is fit for the kingdom of God.
042	LUK	010	001	And after these things, the Lord appointed seventy others, also, and sent them, two and two, before his face, into every city and place to which he himself was about to go.
042	LUK	010	002	He said, therefore, to them: The harvest truly is great, but the laborers are few; pray, therefore, the Lord of the harvest that he send out laborers into his harvest.
042	LUK	010	003	Go; behold, I send you as lambs in the midst of wolves.
042	LUK	010	004	Carry no purse, nor bag, nor sandals; and salute no one on the road.
042	LUK	010	005	Whatever house you enter, first say, Peace be to this house.
042	LUK	010	006	And if a son of peace be there, your peace shall rest on him; but, if not, it shall return upon you.
042	LUK	010	007	And in that house remain, eating and drinking what they have to give; for the laborer is worthy of his hire; go not from house to house.
042	LUK	010	008	And whatever city you enter, and they receive you, eat what is set before you;
042	LUK	010	009	and heal those in it who are sick, and say to them: The kingdom of God has come near to you.
042	LUK	010	010	But whatever city you enter, and they receive you not, go out into the streets of it, and say:
042	LUK	010	011	Even the dust of your city, which cleaves to us, we do wipe off against you; yet know this, that the kingdom of God has come near to you.
042	LUK	010	012	I say to you, It shall be more tolerable, in that day, for Sodom, than for that city.
042	LUK	010	013	Alas for thee, Chorazin! alas for thee, Bethsaida! for, if the mighty works which have been done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.
042	LUK	010	014	But for Tyre and Sidon it shall be more tolerable in the judgment, than for you.
042	LUK	010	015	And thou, Capernaum, who hast been exalted to heaven, shalt be brought down to hades.
042	LUK	010	016	He that hears you, hears me; and he that rejects you, rejects me; and he that rejects me, rejects him that sent me.
042	LUK	010	017	And the seventy returned with joy, and said: Lord, even the demons are subject to us through thy name.
042	LUK	010	018	And he said to them: I saw Satan, like lightning from heaven, falling.
042	LUK	010	019	Behold, I give you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions, and authority over all the power of the enemy; and nothing shall by any means hurt you.
042	LUK	010	020	However, rejoice not in this, that the spirits are subject to you; but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.
042	LUK	010	021	In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said: I thank thee, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to babes; even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight.
042	LUK	010	022	All things are delivered to me by my Father; and no one knows who the Son is but the Father, and who the Father is but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him.
042	LUK	010	023	And he turned to his disciples, and said privately: Blessed are the eyes that see what you see.
042	LUK	010	024	For I say to you, that many prophets and kings desired to see what you see, and did not see; and to hear what you hear, and did not hear.
042	LUK	010	025	And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up to tempt him, and said: Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?
042	LUK	010	026	He said to him: What is written in the law? How do you read?
042	LUK	010	027	He answered and said: You shall love the Lord your God with your whole heart, and with your whole soul, and with your whole strength, and with your whole understanding, and your neighbor as yourself.
042	LUK	010	028	He said to him: You have answered correctly; do this, and you shall live.
042	LUK	010	029	But, wishing to justify himself, he said to Jesus: And who is my neighbor?
042	LUK	010	030	And Jesus answered and said: A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among; robbers, who stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and went away, leaving him half dead.
042	LUK	010	031	And by chance a certain priest went down along that road, and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.
042	LUK	010	032	In like manner, also, a Levite, when he came to the place, went and looked on him, and passed by on the other side.
042	LUK	010	033	But a certain Samaritan, who was on a journey, came near him; and when he saw him, he had compassion on him.
042	LUK	010	034	And he went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine; and he put him on his own beast, and carried him to an inn, and took care of him.
042	LUK	010	035	And on the morrow, when he departed, he took out two denarii, and gave them to the innkeeper, and said to him: Take care of him; and whatever you spend more, on my return, I will repay you.
042	LUK	010	036	Which, then, of these three do you think was neighbor to him that fell among the robbers?
042	LUK	010	037	He replied: He that showed mercy to him. Jesus said to him: Go, and do you likewise.
042	LUK	010	038	And it came to pass, as they continued their journey, that he entered a certain village, and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house.
042	LUK	010	039	And she had a sister called Mary, who also sat at the feet of Jesus, and heard his word.
042	LUK	010	040	But Martha made herself busy with much serving; and she came to him, and said: Lord, dost thou not care that my sister has left me to serve alone? Bid her, therefore, that she help me.
042	LUK	010	041	But Jesus answered and said to her: Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things:
042	LUK	010	042	one thing is needful; and Mary has chosen the good part, which shall not be taken from her.
042	LUK	011	001	And it came to pass, as he was in a certain place praying, that, when he ceased, one of his disciples said to him: Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.
042	LUK	011	002	And he said to them: When you pray, say, Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name; thy kingdom come; thy will be done, as in heaven, so on earth.
042	LUK	011	003	Give us, day by day, the bread sufficient for our support;
042	LUK	011	004	and forgive us our sins, for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.
042	LUK	011	005	And he said to them: Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go to him at midnight, and say to him, Friend, lend me three loaves;
042	LUK	011	006	for a friend of mine, who is on a journey, has come to me, and I have nothing to set before him?
042	LUK	011	007	And he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not; the door is already closed, and my children and myself are in bed; I can not rise and give you.
042	LUK	011	008	I say to you, Although he will not arise and give him, because he is his friend, yet, on account of his importunity, he will arise and give him as many as he needs.
042	LUK	011	009	And I say to you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and you shall find; knock, and it shall be opened to you.
042	LUK	011	010	For every one that asks, receives; and he that seeks, finds; and to him that knocks, it shall be opened.
042	LUK	011	011	If a son ask bread of any one of you that is a father, will he give him a stone? Or if he ask a fish, will he, instead of a fish, give him a serpent?
042	LUK	011	012	Or if he ask an egg, will he give him a scorpion?
042	LUK	011	013	If, then, you, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?
042	LUK	011	014	And he was casting out a demon, and it was dumb; and it came to pass, when the demon had gone out, that the dumb man spoke: and the multitudes wondered.
042	LUK	011	015	But some of them said: He casts out demons by Beelzebul, the prince of the demons.
042	LUK	011	016	And others, that they might tempt him, asked of him a sign from heaven.
042	LUK	011	017	But, knowing their purpose, he said to them: Every kingdom divided against itself, is brought to desolation; and a house that is divided against a house, falls.
042	LUK	011	018	If Satan be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? For you say, that I cast out demons by Beelzebul.
042	LUK	011	019	But if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore, they shall be your judges.
042	LUK	011	020	But if I cast out demons by the finger of God, then has the kingdom of God already come upon you.
042	LUK	011	021	When the strong man armed keeps guard over his palace, his goods are in peace;
042	LUK	011	022	but when one stronger than he comes upon him and overcomes him, he takes away all his armor in which he trusted, and divides his spoils.
042	LUK	011	023	He that is not with me, is against me; and he that gathers not with me, scatters.
042	LUK	011	024	When the unclean spirit has gone out of a man, he goes through dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he says, I will return to my house out of which I came.
042	LUK	011	025	And he comes and finds it swept, and set in order.
042	LUK	011	026	Then he goes and takes with him seven other spirits, more wicked than himself, and they enter in, and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first.
042	LUK	011	027	And it came to pass, that, when he said these things, a certain woman from among the multitude lifted up her voice, and said to him: Blessed is the womb that bore thee, and the breasts that thou didst suck.
042	LUK	011	028	And he said: Yes, rather blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it.
042	LUK	011	029	And when the multitudes were crowded together, he began to say: This is an evil generation; it asks for a sign, and no sign shall be given to it but the sign of Jonah the prophet.
042	LUK	011	030	For as Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites, so the Son of man shall also be to this generation.
042	LUK	011	031	The queen of the south shall rise in the judgment with the men of this generation, and shall condemn them; for she came from the most distant parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and lo, something greater than Solomon is here.
042	LUK	011	032	The men of Nineveh shall rise in the judgment with this generation, and condemn it; for they repented in accordance with the preaching of Jonah; and lo, something greater than Jonah is here.
042	LUK	011	033	No one, when he has lighted a lamp, puts it in a secret place, nor under the measure, but upon the lamp-stand, that those who come in may see the light.
042	LUK	011	034	The lamp of the body is the eye; when, therefore, your eye is sound, your whole body also is light; but if it be diseased, your body also is dark.
042	LUK	011	035	Take heed, therefore, lest the light that is in you be darkness.
042	LUK	011	036	If, therefore, your whole body is light, having no part dark, the whole shall be light, as when a lamp, by its brightness, gives you light.
042	LUK	011	037	And as he spoke, a certain Pharisee asked him to dine with him. And he went in and reclined at table.
042	LUK	011	038	And when the Pharisee saw it, he wondered that he had not first immersed himself before dinner.
042	LUK	011	039	And the Lord said to him: Now you Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and the plate; but your inward part is full of extortion and wickedness.
042	LUK	011	040	Senseless men, did not he who made the outside, make the inside also?
042	LUK	011	041	But give as charity the contents of the cup, and behold, all things are clean for you.
042	LUK	011	042	But alas for you, Pharisees! for you tithe mint and rue and every herb, and pass by the justice and the love of God; these you ought to have done, and those you ought not to have left undone.
042	LUK	011	043	Alas for you, Pharisees! for you love the chief seat in the synagogues, and greetings in the markets.
042	LUK	011	044	Alas for you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you are like graves that are not seen; and men that walk over them know it not.
042	LUK	011	045	And one of the lawyers answered and said to him: Teacher, in saying these things, you reproach us also.
042	LUK	011	046	He replied: Alas for you, lawyers, also! for you bind upon men burdens hard to be borne, and you yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers,
042	LUK	011	047	Alas for you! for you build the sepulchers of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.
042	LUK	011	048	Therefore you attest and approve the deeds of your fathers; for they indeed killed them, and you build their sepulchers.
042	LUK	011	049	For this reason also the Wisdom of God said: I will send them prophets and apostles, and some of them they will kill, and persecute,
042	LUK	011	050	that the blood of all the prophets, which has been shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;
042	LUK	011	051	from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zachariah, who perished between the altar and the temple; yes, I say to you, It shall be required of this generation.
042	LUK	011	052	Alas for you, lawyers! for you have taken away the key of knowledge; you did not go in yourselves, and those who were entering in, you prevented.
042	LUK	011	053	And when he said these things to them, the scribes and the Pharisees began to be very angry, and to put questions to him about many things,
042	LUK	011	054	trying to entrap him, and seeking to lay hold on something from his mouth, that they might accuse him.
042	LUK	012	001	In the mean time, when myriads of the people had come together, so that they trod one upon another, he began to say to his disciples first of all: Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.
042	LUK	012	002	For there is nothing covered, which shall not be revealed, and hid, which shall not be made known.
042	LUK	012	003	Wherefore, what you have spoken in the darkness, shall be heard in the light; and what you have spoken in the ear in closets, shall be proclaimed upon the house-tops.
042	LUK	012	004	But I say to you, my friends, Fear not them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do.
042	LUK	012	005	But I will show you whom you shall fear: Fear him who, after he has killed, has authority to cast into hell; yes, I say to you, Fear him.
042	LUK	012	006	Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings? yet not one of them is forgotten before God.
042	LUK	012	007	But even the hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not, therefore; you are of more value than many sparrows.
042	LUK	012	008	And I further say to you, Whoever confesses me before men, him will the Son of man also confess before the angels of God.
042	LUK	012	009	But he that denies me before men, shall be denied before the angels of God.
042	LUK	012	010	And whoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him; but he that speaks impiously against the Holy Spirit, shall not be forgiven.
042	LUK	012	011	When they bring you to the synagogues, and to rulers and authorities, be not anxious how or what you shall answer, or what you shall say;
042	LUK	012	012	for the Holy Spirit shall teach you in that hour what you ought to say.
042	LUK	012	013	And a certain one of the multitude said to him: Teacher, speak to my brother, that he divide the inheritance with me.
042	LUK	012	014	But he said to him: Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you?
042	LUK	012	015	And he said to them: Take heed and beware of covetousness; for a man’s life depends not on the abundance of his possessions.
042	LUK	012	016	And he spoke a parable to them, saying: The farm of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully.
042	LUK	012	017	And he reasoned within himself, saying: What shall I do? for I have no place in which I can store my fruits.
042	LUK	012	018	And he said: This will I do: I will pull down my barns and I will build larger ones; and there I will store ail my produce, and my good things;
042	LUK	012	019	and I will say to my soul: Soul, you have many good things laid up for many years; take your ease, eat, drink, be merry.
042	LUK	012	020	But God said to him: Senseless man, this night shall your soul be required of you; and who shall have the things which you have provided?
042	LUK	012	021	So is he that lays up treasure for him self, and is not rich toward God.
042	LUK	012	022	And he said to his disciples: For this reason I say to you, Be not anxious for your life, what you shall eat; nor for your body, what you shall put on.
042	LUK	012	023	Life is a greater gift than food, and the body, than clothing.
042	LUK	012	024	Consider the ravens, that they neither sow nor reap; which have neither storehouse nor granary; yet God feeds them: you are of far more value than the birds.
042	LUK	012	025	Which of you, by his anxiety, can add one span to his life?
042	LUK	012	026	If, therefore, you can not do that which is the least, why are you anxious about the rest?
042	LUK	012	027	Consider the lilies, how they grow. They toil not, they spin not; yet I say to you, that Solomon in all his glory was not clothed like one of these.
042	LUK	012	028	If, then, God so clothes the herb of the field, which to-day is, and to-morrow is cast into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?
042	LUK	012	029	And seek not what you shall eat, or what you shall drink, and be not in anxious suspense.
042	LUK	012	030	For all these things the nations of the world seek after; but your Father knows that you have need of these things.
042	LUK	012	031	But seek the kingdom of God, and all these things shall be given you in addition.
042	LUK	012	032	Fear not, little flock, for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom.
042	LUK	012	033	Sell what you have, and be charitable. Make for yourselves purses that do not become old, an unfailing treasure in the heavens, where no thief comes near, and no moth corrupts.
042	LUK	012	034	For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
042	LUK	012	035	Let your loins be girded, and your lamps burning;
042	LUK	012	036	and be like men that are waiting for their lord, when he shall return from the wedding; that, when he comes and knocks, they may open for him immediately.
042	LUK	012	037	Blessed are those servants whom their lord, when he comes, shall find watching. Verily I say to you, That he will gird himself and make them recline at table, and will come forth and serve them.
042	LUK	012	038	And if he shall come in the second watch, and if he shall come in the third watch, and find them thus, blessed are those servants.
042	LUK	012	039	But know this, that if the master of the house had known at what hour the thief comes, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken through.
042	LUK	012	040	Be you, therefore, ready also; for at an hour when you think not, the Son of man comes.
042	LUK	012	041	Then Peter said to him: Lord, dost them speak this parable to us, or also to all?
042	LUK	012	042	And the Lord said: Who, then, is that faithful and wise steward, whom his lord shall make ruler over his servants, to give them their portion of food at the proper time?
042	LUK	012	043	Blessed is that servant whom his lord, when he comes, shall find so doing.
042	LUK	012	044	Of a truth, I say to you, that he will make him ruler over all that he has.
042	LUK	012	045	But if that servant shall say in his heart, My lord delays his coming, and shall begin to strike the men-servants and the maid-servants, and to eat and to drink, and to be drunk;
042	LUK	012	046	the lord of that servant will come in a day in which he looks not for him, and at an hour which he knows not; and will cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the unfaithful.
042	LUK	012	047	And that servant who knew his lord’s will, but made no preparation, nor did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes;
042	LUK	012	048	but he that knew not, and did things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few. To whomever much has been given, of him shall much be required; and to whom men have intrusted much, of him will they ask the more.
042	LUK	012	049	I have come to send fire on the earth; and how greatly do I wish that it were already kindled!
042	LUK	012	050	I have an immersion with which to be immersed, and how distressed I am till it be accomplished!
042	LUK	012	051	Do you think that I have come to give peace in the earth? I toll you, No; but rather dissension.
042	LUK	012	052	For from this time forth there shall be five in one house at variance, three with two, and two with three.
042	LUK	012	053	The father shall be at variance with the son, and the son with the father; the mother with the daughter, and the daughter with the mother; the mother-in-law with her daughter-in-law, and the daughter-in-law with her mother-in-law.
042	LUK	012	054	And he said also to the multitudes: When you see the cloud rising from the west, you immediately say, There comes a shower: and so it is.
042	LUK	012	055	And when the south wind blows, you say, There will be heat: and it comes to pass.
042	LUK	012	056	Hypocrites, you know how to judge of the face of the earth, and of the heavens; but how is it that you do not judge of this time?
042	LUK	012	057	And why even of yourselves do you not judge what is right?
042	LUK	012	058	For when you are going with your opponent at law to the ruler, while you are on the way, endeavor to be delivered from him, lest he drag you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the collector, and the collector throw you into prison.
042	LUK	012	059	I say to you, You shall not come out thence, till you have paid the very last mite.
042	LUK	013	001	And there were present, at that time, some that told him of the Galileans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices.
042	LUK	013	002	And Jesus answered and said to them: Do you think that those Galileans were greater sinners than all other Galileans, because they suffered such things?
042	LUK	013	003	I tell you, No; but unless you repent, you shall all likewise perish.
042	LUK	013	004	Or, those eighteen, on whom the tower in Siloam fell, and killed them; do you think that they were greater debtors than all other men that were living in Jerusalem?
042	LUK	013	005	I tell you, No; but unless you repent, you shall all likewise perish.
042	LUK	013	006	And he spoke this parable: A certain man had a fig-tree that was planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit on it, and found none.
042	LUK	013	007	Then he said to his vine-dresser, Behold, for three years I have come and sought fruit on this fig-tree, and I have found none; cut it down; why does it occupy the ground unprofitably?
042	LUK	013	008	But he answered and said to him, Sir, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and throw in manure;
042	LUK	013	009	and it may bear fruit; but if not, afterward you shall cut it down.
042	LUK	013	010	And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath.
042	LUK	013	011	And, behold, there was a woman who had had a spirit of infirmity for eighteen years; and she was bowed together, and was not able to raise herself up at all.
042	LUK	013	012	And when Jesus saw her, he called her to him, and said to her: Woman, you are released from your infirmity.
042	LUK	013	013	And he laid his hands on her; and she immediately stood erect, and glorified God.
042	LUK	013	014	But the ruler of the synagogue, indignant because Jesus had performed a cure on the sabbath-day, answered and said to the multitude: There are six days in which work ought to be done; on these, therefore, come and be cured, and not on the sabbath-day. Then the Lord answered him and said:
042	LUK	013	015	Hypocrites, does not each one of you, on the sabbath, loose his ox or his ass from the stable, and lead him away, and give him water?
042	LUK	013	016	And ought not this woman, who is a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has bound, lo, these eighteen years, to be loosed from this bond on the sabbath-day?
042	LUK	013	017	And when he had said these things, all his adversaries were ashamed; and all the multitude rejoiced on account of all the glorious things that were done by him.
042	LUK	013	018	Then he said: To what is the kingdom of God like; and to what shall I liken it?
042	LUK	013	019	It is like a grain of mustard, which a man took, and sowed in his garden; and it grew, and became a great tree; and the birds of the air roosted in its branches.
042	LUK	013	020	And again he said: To what shall I liken the kingdom of God?
042	LUK	013	021	It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of flour, till the whole was leavened.
042	LUK	013	022	And he went through every city and village, teaching, and journeying to Jerusalem.
042	LUK	013	023	And a certain man said to him: Lord, are there few that are saved? And he said to them:
042	LUK	013	024	Strive to enter in through the strait gate; for many, I say to you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.
042	LUK	013	025	When once the master of the house has risen, and closed the door, and you begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open for us, and he shall answer and say to you, I know you not, whence you are;
042	LUK	013	026	then, you will begin to say, We have eaten and drunk in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streets.
042	LUK	013	027	And he shall say, I tell you, I know you not, whence you are; depart from me, all you workers of iniquity.
042	LUK	013	028	There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, but your selves cast out.
042	LUK	013	029	And they shall come from the east and the west, and from the north and the south, and shall recline at table in the kingdom of God.
042	LUK	013	030	And behold, there are last that shall be first, and there arc first that shall be last.
042	LUK	013	031	On the same day, certain Pharisees came and said to him: Depart, and get away from this place; for Herod intends to kill you.
042	LUK	013	032	And he said to them: Go and toll that fox, Behold, I cast out demons, and perform cures to-day and to-morrow, and the third day I finish the work.
042	LUK	013	033	But I must continue my journey to-day and to-morrow and the day following; for it is not possible that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem.
042	LUK	013	034	Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that killest the prophets and stonest them that are sent to thee: how often have I desired to gather thy children together, as a bird gathers her young under her wings, and you refused.
042	LUK	013	035	Behold, your house is deserted; and I say to you, You shall not see me till the time come when you shall say, Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord.
042	LUK	014	001	And it came to pass, that he went, on the sabbath-day, into the house of one of the chief men of the Pharisees, to eat bread; and they watched him.
042	LUK	014	002	And behold, there was a man before him, who had the dropsy.
042	LUK	014	003	And Jesus answered and spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying: Is it lawful to cure on the sabbath-day?
042	LUK	014	004	But they were silent. And he took him, and healed him, and let him go.
042	LUK	014	005	And he answered and said to them: Which of you, if his son or his ox should fall into a pit, would not immediately pull him out on the sabbath-day?
042	LUK	014	006	And they were not able to give him an answer to these things.
042	LUK	014	007	And he spoke a parable to those who had been invited, when he observed how they were choosing the first places at table; and he said to them:
042	LUK	014	008	When you are invited by any one to a wedding, do not recline in the first place, lest a more honorable man than you may have been invited by him;
042	LUK	014	009	and he that invited you and him, come and say to you, Give place to this man; and then you shall begin with shame to take the last place.
042	LUK	014	010	But when you are invited, go and recline in the last place, that when he that invited you shall come, he may say to you, Friend, go up higher. Then you shall have honor in the presence of those who recline with you.
042	LUK	014	011	For every one that exalts himself shall be humbled; and he that humbles himself shall be exalted.
042	LUK	014	012	Then he said also to him that had invited him: When you make a dinner or a supper, call not your friends, nor your brothers, nor your relatives, nor your rich neighbors, lest they also invite you in return, and a recompense be made you.
042	LUK	014	013	But when you make a feast, invite the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind;
042	LUK	014	014	and you shall be blessed; for they have no power to repay you; but you shall be repaid at the resurrection of the just.
042	LUK	014	015	And a certain one of those who reclined at table with him, after hearing these things, said to him: Blessed is he who shall cat bread in the kingdom of God.
042	LUK	014	016	And he said to him: A certain man made a great supper, and invited many.
042	LUK	014	017	And he sent his servant at the hour of supper, to say to those who had been invited, Come, for all things are now ready.
042	LUK	014	018	And they all, with one consent, began to make excuse. The first said to him, I have bought a farm, and I must go and see it; I pray you, have me excused.
042	LUK	014	019	And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I am going to try them; I pray you, have me excused.
042	LUK	014	020	And another said, I have married a wife, and, for this reason, I can not come.
042	LUK	014	021	And that servant came and told his lord these things. Then the master of the house was angry, and said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor and the maimed, the lame and the blind.
042	LUK	014	022	And the servant said, Lord, it is done as you commanded, and yet there is room.
042	LUK	014	023	And the lord said to his servant, Go out into the roads, and among the hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be full.
042	LUK	014	024	For I say to you, that not one of those men who have been invited, shall taste of my supper.
042	LUK	014	025	And many multitudes were journeying with him; and he turned and said to them:
042	LUK	014	026	If any one comes to me, and hates not his father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, and his own life also, he can not be my disciple.
042	LUK	014	027	And whoever does not bear his cross, and come after me, can not be my disciple.
042	LUK	014	028	For which of you, intending to build a tower, does not first sit down, and count the cost, whether he has the means to finish it?
042	LUK	014	029	Lest, when he has laid the foundation, and is not able to finish, all that see it begin to deride him,
042	LUK	014	030	saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish.
042	LUK	014	031	Or, what king, going to make war against another king, does not first sit down, and deliberate whether he is able, with ten thousand, to meet him that is coming; against him with twenty thousand?
042	LUK	014	032	And if not, while he is yet at a distance, he sends an embassy, and asks for conditions of peace.
042	LUK	014	033	So, then, whoever of you does not forsake all that he has, can not be my disciple.
042	LUK	014	034	Salt is good; but if the salt become tasteless, by what means shall it become salt again?
042	LUK	014	035	It is fit neither for earth, nor for manure; but they cast it out. He that has ears to hear, let him hear.
042	LUK	015	001	And all the publicans and the sinners came near to him to hear him.
042	LUK	015	002	And the Pharisees and the scribes murmured, saying: This man receives sinners, and eats with them.
042	LUK	015	003	And he spoke this parable to them, saying:
042	LUK	015	004	What man of you that has a hundred sheep, and loses one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the desert, and go after that which is lost, till he find it?
042	LUK	015	005	And when he finds it, he puts it on his shoulders, rejoicing.
042	LUK	015	006	And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and neighbors, and says to them., Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep that was lost.
042	LUK	015	007	I say to you, That thus there shall be joy in heaven over one sinner that repents, more than over ninety-nine just persons, who need no repentance.
042	LUK	015	008	Or, what woman that has ten drachmas, if she lose one drachma, does not light a lamp, and sweep the house, and search carefully till she find it?
042	LUK	015	009	And when she finds it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, Rejoice with me, for I have found the drachma that I lost.
042	LUK	015	010	So, I say to you, There is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repents.
042	LUK	015	011	Then he said: A certain man had two sons.
042	LUK	015	012	And the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of the property that falls to me. And he divided his estate between them.
042	LUK	015	013	And not many days after, the younger son, taking with him all that was his, left home for a distant country, and there wasted his property in riotous living.
042	LUK	015	014	When he had spent all, there was a great famine throughout that country, and he began to be in want.
042	LUK	015	015	And he went and attached himself to one of the citizens of that country, who sent him into his fields to feed swine.
042	LUK	015	016	And he would gladly have filled his stomach with the pods which the swine did eat. And no one gave to him.
042	LUK	015	017	But when he came to himself, he said, How many of my father’s hired servants have bread enough and to spare, and I am perishing with hunger!
042	LUK	015	018	I will arise and go to my father, and I will say to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight,
042	LUK	015	019	and am no longer worthy to be called your son: make me as one of your hired servants.
042	LUK	015	020	And he arose, and came to his father. And while he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion on him, and ran and fell upon his neck, and kissed him.
042	LUK	015	021	But his son said to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight, and am no longer worthy to be called your son.
042	LUK	015	022	But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand, and sandals on his feet.
042	LUK	015	023	And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it, and let us eat and be merry;
042	LUK	015	024	for this my son was dead, and is alive again: he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry.
042	LUK	015	025	But his elder son was in the field; and as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing.
042	LUK	015	026	And he called to him one of the servants, and asked what these things meant.
042	LUK	015	027	And he said to him, Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fatted calf, because he has received him in health.
042	LUK	015	028	And he was angry, and would not go in. Then his father went out and entreated him.
042	LUK	015	029	But he answered and said to his father, Behold, for so many years do I serve you, and never have I transgressed your commandment, and yet you never gave me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends.
042	LUK	015	030	But as soon as this your son has come, Who has eaten up your estate with harlots, you have killed for him the fatted calf.
042	LUK	015	031	And he said to him, Son, you are ever with me, and all that I have is yours.
042	LUK	015	032	But it became us to make merry and rejoice; for this your brother was dead, and is alive again: was lost, and is found.
042	LUK	016	001	And he said also to his disciples: There was a certain rich man, who had a steward; and he was accused to him of wasting his goods.
042	LUK	016	002	And he called him, and said to him: What is this that I hear of you? Give an account of your stewardship, for you can no longer act as steward.
042	LUK	016	003	And the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my lord takes from me the stewardship. I have not strength to dig; I am ashamed to beg.
042	LUK	016	004	I am resolved on what I shall do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, I may be received into their houses.
042	LUK	016	005	And he called to him every one of his lord’s debtors, and said to the first, How much do you owe my lord?
042	LUK	016	006	He replied, A hundred baths of oil. And he said to him, Take back your note, and sit down quickly, and write fifty.
042	LUK	016	007	Then he said to another, How much do you owe? He replied, A hundred homers of wheat. And he said to him, Take back your note, and write eighty.
042	LUK	016	008	And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he acted prudently. For the children of this age are more prudent toward their generation than the children of light.
042	LUK	016	009	And I say to you, Make for yourselves friends with the unrighteous riches, that when you fail, you may be received into the everlasting habitations.
042	LUK	016	010	He that is faithful in the least, is faithful also in much. He that is unjust in the least, is unjust also in much.
042	LUK	016	011	If, therefore, you have not been faithful in the unrighteous riches, who will intrust you with the true?
042	LUK	016	012	And if you have not been faithful in that which is another’s, who will give to you that which is your own?
042	LUK	016	013	No servant can serve two masters; for he will either hate the one, and love the other; or he will cleave to the one, and despise the other. You can not serve God and riches.
042	LUK	016	014	And the Pharisees also, who were lovers of money, heard all these things, and they scoffed at him.
042	LUK	016	015	And he said to them: You set yourselves forth as righteous before men, but God knows your hearts; for that which is highly esteemed among men, is detestable in the sight of God.
042	LUK	016	016	The law and the prophets were till John. Since that time, the kingdom of God is preached, and every one enters it by force.
042	LUK	016	017	But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away, than for one point of the law to fail.
042	LUK	016	018	Whoever divorces his wife and marries another, commits adultery: and whoever marries her that is divorced, commits adultery.
042	LUK	016	019	There was a certain rich man, who was clothed in purple and fine linen, and feasted sumptuously every day.
042	LUK	016	020	And there was a certain poor man named Lazarus, who was laid at his gate, full of sores:
042	LUK	016	021	and he would gladly have been fed with the crumbs that fell from the rich man’s table. And even the dogs came and licked his sores.
042	LUK	016	022	And it came to pass, that the poor man died, and was carried by angels to Abraham’s bosom. The rich man also died, and was buried;
042	LUK	016	023	and in hades he lifted up his eyes, being in torments, and saw Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.
042	LUK	016	024	And he called to him and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.
042	LUK	016	025	But Abraham said, Son, remember that, in your lifetime, you received your good things, and likewise Lazarus his evil things. But now he is comforted, and you are tormented.
042	LUK	016	026	And beside all this, between us and you there is a great chasm fixed, so that they that would pass hence to you, can not; nor can they that would, pass thence to us.
042	LUK	016	027	Then he said, I beseech you, therefore, father, that you would send him to my father’s house;
042	LUK	016	028	for I have five brothers; that he may earnestly admonish them, lest they also come to this place of torment.
042	LUK	016	029	Abraham said to him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.
042	LUK	016	030	But he said, Not so, Father Abraham; but if one should go to them from the dead, they would repent.
042	LUK	016	031	But he said to him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, they will not be persuaded, though one should rise from the dead.
042	LUK	017	001	Then he said to his disciples: It is impossible that causes of offense should not come; but alas for him by whom they come!
042	LUK	017	002	It would be better for him that a millstone were hung about his neck, and he were thrown into the sea, than that he should cause one of these little ones to sin.
042	LUK	017	003	Take heed to yourselves; if your brother sin against you, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him.
042	LUK	017	004	And if he sin against you seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again to you and say, I repent, you shall forgive him.
042	LUK	017	005	And the apostles said to the Lord: Increase our faith.
042	LUK	017	006	And the Lord said: If you had faith like a grain of mustard, you might say to this sycamine-tree, Be uprooted, and be planted in the sea, and it should obey you.
042	LUK	017	007	Which of you that has a servant plowing, or feeding a flock, will say to him immediately, when he comes in from the field, Go and recline at table?
042	LUK	017	008	But will he not say to him, Make ready my supper, and gird yourself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunk; and afterward, you shall eat and drink?
042	LUK	017	009	Does he thank that servant, because he did what was commanded? I think not.
042	LUK	017	010	So also you, when you shall have done all things that you arc commanded to do, say, We are unprofitable servants; for we have done what was our duty to do.
042	LUK	017	011	And it came to pass, as he was journeying to Jerusalem, that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.
042	LUK	017	012	And as he entered a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, who stood at a distance.
042	LUK	017	013	And they lifted up their voice, saying: Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.
042	LUK	017	014	And when he saw them, he said to them: Go, show yourselves to the priests. And it came to pass, that, as they went, they were made clean.
042	LUK	017	015	But, one of them, seeing that he was restored to health, turned back, and, with a loud voice, glorified God.
042	LUK	017	016	And he fell on his face at his feet, and gave him thanks; and he was a Samaritan.
042	LUK	017	017	And Jesus answered and said: Were not the ten cleansed? but where are the nine?
042	LUK	017	018	Were there none found to return and give glory to God, but this one of another race?
042	LUK	017	019	And he said to him: Arise, and go; your faith has saved you.
042	LUK	017	020	And being asked by the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said: The kingdom of God comes not so as to attract attention;
042	LUK	017	021	nor shall it be said, Lo here! or Lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is among you.
042	LUK	017	022	And he said to his disciples: The days will come, when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and shall not see it.
042	LUK	017	023	And they shall say to you, Lo here! or Lo there! go not after them, nor follow them.
042	LUK	017	024	For as the lightning that flashes out of one part under heaven, shines to another part under heaven, so shall the Son of man be in his day.
042	LUK	017	025	But first he must suffer many things, and be rejected by this generation.
042	LUK	017	026	And as it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.
042	LUK	017	027	They ate, they drank, they married, they were given in marriage, till the day in which Noah entered the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all.
042	LUK	017	028	In like manner also, as it was in the days of Lot: they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded;
042	LUK	017	029	but in the day in which Lot went out of Sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all.
042	LUK	017	030	Even thus shall it be in the day in which the Son of man is revealed.
042	LUK	017	031	In that day, let not him that is on the house-top, and whose goods are in the house, come down to take them away. Likewise, he that is in the field, let him not turn back.
042	LUK	017	032	Remember Lot’s wife.
042	LUK	017	033	Whoever will seek to save his life, shall lose it; and whoever will lose his life, shall save it.
042	LUK	017	034	I say to you, on that night two men shall be in one bed; the one shall be taken, and the other left.
042	LUK	017	035	Two women shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken, and the other left.
042	LUK	017	036	Two men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.
042	LUK	017	037	And they answered and said to him. Where, Lord? And he said to them: Where the body is, there will the vultures be gathered.
042	LUK	018	001	And he spoke a parable to them, that they ought always to pray, and not to become weary,
042	LUK	018	002	saying: There was in a certain city a judge, who neither feared God nor regarded man.
042	LUK	018	003	And there was a widow in that city, and she came to him, and said: Avenge me on my opponent at law.
042	LUK	018	004	And for a while he refused. But afterward he said within himself: Though I fear not God, nor regard man,
042	LUK	018	005	yet, because this widow troubles me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me.
042	LUK	018	006	And the Lord said: Hear what the unjust judge says;
042	LUK	018	007	and will not God avenge his elect, who cry to him day and night, though he delay long in respect to them?
042	LUK	018	008	I say to you, that he will avenge them speedily. Yet, when the Son of man comes, will he find the faith on the earth?
042	LUK	018	009	And he spoke this parable to some, who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and who despised others.
042	LUK	018	010	Two men went up into the temple to pray, the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.
042	LUK	018	011	The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself: God, I thank thee that I am not as other men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.
042	LUK	018	012	I fast twice in the week; I give tithes of all that I possess.
042	LUK	018	013	And the publican, standing afar off, would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying: God, be merciful to me a sinner.
042	LUK	018	014	I say to you, this man went down to his house justified, rather than the other. For every one that exalts himself, shall be humbled; but he that humbles himself, shall be exalted.
042	LUK	018	015	And they brought to him infants also, that he might touch them. But when his disciples saw it, they rebuked them.
042	LUK	018	016	And Jesus called them to him, and said: Let the little children come to me, and hinder them not; for of such is the kingdom of God.
042	LUK	018	017	Verily I say to you, Whoever shall not receive the kingdom of God, as a little child, shall in no way enter into it.
042	LUK	018	018	And a certain ruler asked him, saying: Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?
042	LUK	018	019	And Jesus said to him: Why do you call me good? None is good but one, that is God.
042	LUK	018	020	You know the commandments, Do not commit adultery; Do not kill; Do not steal; Do not bear false testimony; Honor your father and your mother.
042	LUK	018	021	He replied: All these have I kept from my youth.
042	LUK	018	022	When Jesus heard this, he said to him: One thing you yet lack; sell all that you have, and give to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.
042	LUK	018	023	And when he heard this, he was very sad, for he was very rich.
042	LUK	018	024	When Jesus saw that he was very sad, he said: How difficult it is for those who have riches to enter into the kingdom of God!
042	LUK	018	025	For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom, of God.
042	LUK	018	026	And those who heard it said: Who, then, can be saved?
042	LUK	018	027	He replied: Things that are impossible with men, are possible with God.
042	LUK	018	028	Then Peter said: Behold, we have left all and followed thee.
042	LUK	018	029	And he said to them: Verily I say to you, There is no one that has left house, or parents, or brothers, or wife, or children, for the sake of the kingdom of God,
042	LUK	018	030	who shall not receive manifold more in this time, and in the age to come, eternal life.
042	LUK	018	031	And he took the twelve aside, and said to them: Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished.:
042	LUK	018	032	For he shall be delivered to the Gentiles, and shall be derided and insulted and spit upon;
042	LUK	018	033	and they shall scourge him, and put him to death, and on the third day he shall rise again.
042	LUK	018	034	And they understood none of these things; and this saying was concealed from them; and they understood not the things that were spoken.
042	LUK	018	035	And it came to pass, that, as he came near to Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the road begging.
042	LUK	018	036	And when he heard the multitude passing by, he asked what this meant.
042	LUK	018	037	And they told him that Jesus the Nazarene was passing by.
042	LUK	018	038	And he cried out and said: Jesus, son of David, have mercy on me.
042	LUK	018	039	And those who went before rebuked him, that he should be silent. But he cried so much the more: Son of David, have mercy on me.
042	LUK	018	040	And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be brought to him. And when he came near, he asked him,
042	LUK	018	041	saying: What do you wish me to do for you? he replied: Lord, that I may receive my sight.
042	LUK	018	042	And Jesus said to him: Receive your sight; your faith has saved you.
042	LUK	018	043	And he immediately received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God. And all the people, when they saw it, gave praise to God.
042	LUK	019	001	And he entered, and passed through Jericho.
042	LUK	019	002	And, behold, there was a man called Zacchæus, who was a chief publican; and he was rich.
042	LUK	019	003	And he sought to see Jesus, who he was, and was not able on account of the multitude, because he was of small stature.
042	LUK	019	004	And he ran before, and climbed up a sycamore-tree, that he might see him, for he was about to pass that way.
042	LUK	019	005	And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up and saw him, and said to him: Zacchæus, make haste and come down, for I must spend this day at your house.
042	LUK	019	006	And he made haste and came down, and received him joyfully.
042	LUK	019	007	And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying: He has gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner.
042	LUK	019	008	And Zacchæus stood, and said to the Lord: Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken from any one by false accusation, I restore him fourfold.
042	LUK	019	009	And Jesus said to him: To-day has salvation come to this house, since he also is a son of Abraham.
042	LUK	019	010	For the Son of man has come to seek and to save that which was lost.
042	LUK	019	011	And as they heard these things, he also spoke a parable, because he was near Jerusalem, and they thought that the kingdom of God would immediately appear.
042	LUK	019	012	He said, therefore: A certain nobleman went into a distant country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.
042	LUK	019	013	And he called his ten servants, and gave them ten pounds, and said to them, Engage in trade till I come.
042	LUK	019	014	But his citizens hated him, and sent an embassy after him, saying, We will not have this man to reign over us.
042	LUK	019	015	And it came to pass, that, when he had returned, having received the kingdom, he commanded those servants to be called, to whom he had given the money, that he might know what each had gained by trading.
042	LUK	019	016	And the first came and said: Lord, your pound has gained ten pounds.
042	LUK	019	017	And he said to him: Well done, good servant; because you have been faithful in a very little, have authority over ten cities.
042	LUK	019	018	And the second came and said: Lord, your pound has gained five pounds.
042	LUK	019	019	And he said to him also: And be you over five cities.
042	LUK	019	020	And another came and said: Lord, behold your pound, which I have kept laid away in a napkin.
042	LUK	019	021	For I was afraid of you, because you are a hard man; you take up that which you did not lay down, and reap that which you did not sow.
042	LUK	019	022	Then he said to him: Out of your own mouth will I judge you, you wicked servant. You knew that I was a hard man, taking up what I did not lay down, and reaping what I did not sow.
042	LUK	019	023	And why then did you not put my money into the bank, that, when I came, I could have collected it with interest?
042	LUK	019	024	And he said to those who stood by: Take from him the pound, and give it to him that has ten pounds.
042	LUK	019	025	And they said to him: Lord, he has ten pounds.
042	LUK	019	026	For I say to you, To every one that has, it shall be given; but from him that has not, even that which he has shall be taken away.
042	LUK	019	027	But those who are my enemies, who were not willing that I should rule over them, bring hither, and slay them before me.
042	LUK	019	028	And when he had said these things, he went before, going up to Jerusalem.
042	LUK	019	029	And it came to pass, that, when he came near to Bethphage and Bethany, to the mount called the mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,
042	LUK	019	030	saying: Go into the opposite village, in which, when you enter, you will find a colt tied, on which no man ever sat. Loose him, and bring him.
042	LUK	019	031	And if any one ask you why you loose him, thus shall you say to him: The Lord has need of him.
042	LUK	019	032	And those who were sent, went, and found as he had said to them.
042	LUK	019	033	And as they were loosing the colt, the owners of him said to them: Why do you loose the colt?
042	LUK	019	034	They replied: The Lord has need of him.
042	LUK	019	035	And they brought him to Jesus, and threw their mantles upon the colt, and set Jesus on him.
042	LUK	019	036	And as he was going on, they spread their mantles in the road.
042	LUK	019	037	And when he was now near the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and to praise God, with a loud voice, for all the mighty deeds which they had seen,
042	LUK	019	038	saying: Blessed is the king that comes in the name of the Lord; peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.
042	LUK	019	039	And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude, said to him: Teacher, rebuke your disciples.
042	LUK	019	040	And he answered, and said to them: I say to you, that if these had been silent, the stones would have cried out.
042	LUK	019	041	And when he came near, he looked upon the city, and wept over it,
042	LUK	019	042	saying: Hadst thou known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things which were for thy peace! But now, they are hid from thy eyes.
042	LUK	019	043	For the days will come upon thee, when thy enemies will throw up a mound about thee, and inclose thee around, and keep thee in on every side,
042	LUK	019	044	and will destroy thee and thy children within thee, and will not leave in thee one stone upon another, because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.
042	LUK	019	045	And he went into the temple, and began to drive out those who were selling in it, and those who were buying,
042	LUK	019	046	and said to them: It is written, My house is a house of prayer; but you have made it a den of robbers.
042	LUK	019	047	And he was teaching daily in the temple. But the chief priests, and the scribes, and the chief of the people sought to destroy him,
042	LUK	019	048	and found nothing that they could do, for all the people hung on his words.
042	LUK	020	001	And it came to pass, that, on one of those days, while he was teaching the people in the temple, and preaching the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes, with the elders, came to him,
042	LUK	020	002	and spoke to him, saying: Tell us by what authority you do these things? or, who is he that gave you this authority?
042	LUK	020	003	And he answered and said to them: I also will ask you one thing, and do you answer me.
042	LUK	020	004	Was the immersion of John from heaven, or from men?
042	LUK	020	005	And they reasoned among themselves, saying: If we say, From heaven, he will reply: Why, then, did you not believe him?
042	LUK	020	006	But if we say, From men, all the people will stone us; for they believe that John was a prophet.
042	LUK	020	007	And they answered, that they knew not whence it was.
042	LUK	020	008	And Jesus said to them: Nor do I tell you by what authority I do these things.
042	LUK	020	009	And he began to speak this parable to the people: A man planted a vineyard, and let it out to vine-dressers, and was absent from home for a long time.
042	LUK	020	010	And at the proper season, he sent a servant to those vine-dressers, that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard. But the vine-dressers scourged him, and sent him away empty-handed.
042	LUK	020	011	And he then sent another servant. But they scourged him also, and treated him shamefully, and sent him away empty-handed.
042	LUK	020	012	And he also sent a third; but they wounded him, and drove him out.
042	LUK	020	013	And the owner of the vineyard said: What shall I do? I will send my beloved son; perhaps, when they see him, they will reverence him.
042	LUK	020	014	But when the vine-dressers saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying: This is the heir; come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.
042	LUK	020	015	And they drove him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What, then, will the owner of the vineyard do to them?
042	LUK	020	016	He will come and destroy these vine-dressers, and will give his vineyard to others. And when they heard it, they said: Be it not so!
042	LUK	020	017	And he looked on them and said: What, then, does this mean, which is written, The stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the corner?
042	LUK	020	018	Whoever shall fall on this stone, shall be dashed to pieces; but on whomever it shall fall, it will make him as chaff for the wind.
042	LUK	020	019	And the chief priests and the scribes sought to lay hands on him, the same hour; (and yet they feared the people; ) for they knew that he spoke this parable against them.
042	LUK	020	020	And they watched him, and sent spies, who feigned them selves to be just men, that they might take hold of his words, in order to deliver him up to the power and authority of the governor.
042	LUK	020	021	And they asked him, saying: Teacher, we know that you speak and teach rightly, and do not regard the person of any, but teach the way of God in truth.
042	LUK	020	022	Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Cæsar, or not?
042	LUK	020	023	But he perceived their cunning, and said to them: Why do you tempt me?
042	LUK	020	024	Show me a denarius. Whose image and superscription has it? They answered and said: Cæsar’s.
042	LUK	020	025	He said to them: Give, therefore, to Cæsar the things that are Cæsar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.
042	LUK	020	026	And they were not able to take hold of his words before the people. And they were astonished at his answer, and were silent.
042	LUK	020	027	Then there came to him some of the Sadducees, (these deny that there is any resurrection, ) and asked him,
042	LUK	020	028	saying: Teacher, Moses wrote for us, If any man’s brother die, having a wife, and he die without children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up children for his brother.
042	LUK	020	029	There were, therefore, seven brothers; and the first took a wife, and died without children;
042	LUK	020	030	and the second took his wife, and he died without children;
042	LUK	020	031	and the third took her; and in like manner also the seven; and they left no children, and died.
042	LUK	020	032	Last of all, the woman also died.
042	LUK	020	033	Therefore, in the resurrection, of which of them shall she be the wife? for the seven had her as a wife.
042	LUK	020	034	And Jesus answered and said to them: The children of this age marry, and are given in marriage.
042	LUK	020	035	But those who shall be accounted worthy to attain that age, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage.
042	LUK	020	036	For they can die no more; for they are like the angels, and are the sons of God, being the sons of the resurrection.
042	LUK	020	037	But: that the dead are raised, even Moses showed at The Bush, since he calls the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.
042	LUK	020	038	He is not a God of the dead, but of the living; for all live to him.
042	LUK	020	039	And certain of the scribes answered and said: Teacher, thou hast answered well.
042	LUK	020	040	And after this they durst not ask him any question at all.
042	LUK	020	041	But he said to them: How say they that the Christ is the son of David?
042	LUK	020	042	Even David himself says, in the book of Psalms: The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand,
042	LUK	020	043	till I make thy enemies thy footstool.
042	LUK	020	044	David, therefore, calls him Lord; and how is he his son?
042	LUK	020	045	And while all the people were listening, he said to his disciples:
042	LUK	020	046	Beware of the scribes, who delight to walk in robes, and love greetings in the markets, and the first seats in the synagogues, and the first places at suppers;
042	LUK	020	047	who eat up the houses of widows, and, for a pretext, make long prayers. These shall receive the greater condemnation.
042	LUK	021	001	And he looked up, and saw the rich throwing their gifts into the treasury.
042	LUK	021	002	And he saw also a certain poor widow throw in thither two mites.
042	LUK	021	003	And he said: Of a truth, I say to you, that this poor widow has thrown in more than they all.
042	LUK	021	004	For all these, from their abundance, have thrown in among the gifts of God; but she, from her poverty, has thrown in all the living that she had.
042	LUK	021	005	And as some were saying of the temple, that it was adorned with beautiful stones and offerings, he said:
042	LUK	021	006	As for these things which you see, the days will come in which there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.
042	LUK	021	007	And they asked him, saying: Teacher, when shall these things be? And what shall be the sign when these things come to pass?
042	LUK	021	008	He replied: Take heed that you be not deceived; for many will come in my name, saying: I am he; and, The time is near. Go not, therefore, after them.
042	LUK	021	009	But when you hear of wars, and tumults, be not terrified; for these things must first take place; but the end comes not immediately.
042	LUK	021	010	Then he said to them: Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom;
042	LUK	021	011	and there shall be great earthquakes in various places, and famines, and pestilences; and there shall be fearful sights and great signs from heaven.
042	LUK	021	012	But before all these things, they will lay their hands on you, and persecute you, delivering you up to synagogues, and into prisons, after being brought before kings and governors for my name’s sake.
042	LUK	021	013	But this shall become to you the means of bearing testimony.
042	LUK	021	014	Therefore, determine in your hearts not to meditate beforehand what you shall answer;
042	LUK	021	015	for I will give you a mouth, and wisdom, which all your opposers shall not be able to gainsay or withstand.
042	LUK	021	016	But you will be delivered up by parents and brothers and relatives and friends; and some of you they will put to death;
042	LUK	021	017	and you will be hated by all for my name’s sake.
042	LUK	021	018	Yet a hair of your head shall not perish.
042	LUK	021	019	By your patient endurance, preserve your lives.
042	LUK	021	020	But when you shall see Jerusalem besieged by armies, then know that its desolation is near.
042	LUK	021	021	Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains; and let those who are in the midst of it, withdraw from it. Let those who are in the count try, not come within it.
042	LUK	021	022	For these are the days of vengeance, that all things that are written may be fulfilled.
042	LUK	021	023	But alas for them that are with child, and for them that give suck in those days! for there shall be great distress upon the land, and wrath upon this people.
042	LUK	021	024	And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and be led away captive among all nations; and Jerusalem shall be trodden down by the Gentiles, till the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.
042	LUK	021	025	And there shall be signs in the sun and in the moon and in the stars; and on the earth, distress of nations in perplexity; the sea and its waves roaring;
042	LUK	021	026	men’s hearts failing on account of the fearful expectation of the things that are coming on the land; for the hosts of the heavens shall be shaken.
042	LUK	021	027	And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.
042	LUK	021	028	When these things begin to take place, look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draws near.
042	LUK	021	029	And he spoke a parable to them: See the fig-tree, and all the trees;
042	LUK	021	030	when they now put forth leaves, you see, and know of yourselves that summer is near.
042	LUK	021	031	So likewise, when you see these things taking place, you know that the kingdom of God is near.
042	LUK	021	032	Verily I say to you, This generation shall not pass away till all be fulfilled.
042	LUK	021	033	Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.
042	LUK	021	034	And take heed to yourselves, lest your hearts become heavy with reveling and drunkenness and the cares of life, and that day come upon you when you look not for it.
042	LUK	021	035	For as a snare, it shall come on all that dwell on the face of all the land.
042	LUK	021	036	Watch, therefore, and pray at all times, that you may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.
042	LUK	021	037	And in the day-time he was teaching in the temple. But he went out and passed the nights in the mount called the mount of Olives.
042	LUK	021	038	And all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple, in order to hear him.
042	LUK	022	001	Now the feast of unleavened bread, which is called the passover, was at hand.
042	LUK	022	002	And the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might kill him; for they feared the people.
042	LUK	022	003	But Satan entered into Judas surnamed Iscariot, who was of the number of the twelve.
042	LUK	022	004	And he went away, and conferred with the chief priests and the captains how he might deliver him up to them.
042	LUK	022	005	And they were glad, and agreed to give him money.
042	LUK	022	006	And he consented, and sought an opportunity to deliver him up to them without tumult.
042	LUK	022	007	Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover must be killed.
042	LUK	022	008	And he sent Peter and John, saying: Go, make ready the passover for us, that we may eat it.
042	LUK	022	009	They said to him: Where dost thou wish that we make it ready?
042	LUK	022	010	And he said to them: Behold, as you go into the city, there shall meet you a man carrying a pitcher of water; follow him into the house that he enters;
042	LUK	022	011	and say to the master of the house: The Teacher says to you, Where is the room in which I may eat the passover with my disciples?
042	LUK	022	012	And he will show you a large upper room furnished; there make ready.
042	LUK	022	013	And they went, and found as he had said to them; and they made ready the passover.
042	LUK	022	014	And when the hour had come, he reclined at table, and the twelve apostles with him.
042	LUK	022	015	And he said to them: I have greatly desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer.
042	LUK	022	016	For I say to you, I will eat of it no more till it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.
042	LUK	022	017	And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said: Take this, and divide it among yourselves;
042	LUK	022	018	for I say to you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine till the kingdom of God has come.
042	LUK	022	019	And he took bread, and gave thanks; and he broke, and gave it to them, saying: This is my body, which is given for you: do this in remembrance of me.
042	LUK	022	020	In like manner also, the cup, after he had supped, saying: This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is shed for you.
042	LUK	022	021	But, behold, the hand of him that delivers me up is with me on the table.
042	LUK	022	022	And the Son of man goes, as it is determined; but alas for that man by whom he is delivered up.
042	LUK	022	023	And they began to inquire among themselves, which of them it could be that was about to do this thing.
042	LUK	022	024	And there had been also a contention among them, which of them was thought to be the greatest.
042	LUK	022	025	And he said to them: The kings of the nations have dominion over them, and those who exercise authority over them are called benefactors.
042	LUK	022	026	But you shall not be so; but let the greatest among you be as the younger, and him that is chief, as he that serves.
042	LUK	022	027	For which is greater, he that reclines at table, or he that serves? Is not he that reclines at table? But I am among you as one that serves.
042	LUK	022	028	You are they that have continued with me in my trials;
042	LUK	022	029	and I appoint to you a kingdom, as my Father has appointed to me,
042	LUK	022	030	that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
042	LUK	022	031	And the Lord said: Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has demanded you apostles for himself, that he may sift you as wheat.
042	LUK	022	032	But I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith fail not. And when you have turned to me again, strengthen your brethren.
042	LUK	022	033	And he said to him: Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both to prison and to death.
042	LUK	022	034	He replied: I tell you, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day before you have three times denied that you know me.
042	LUK	022	035	And he said to them: When I sent you without purse and bag and sandals, did you need any thing? They replied: Nothing.
042	LUK	022	036	Then he said to them: But now, he that has a purse, let him take it, and likewise a bag; and he that has no sword, let him sell his mantle and buy one.
042	LUK	022	037	For I say to you, That even this which is written must be fulfilled in me: And he was numbered with transgressors. For the things concerning me have an end.
042	LUK	022	038	And they said: Lord, behold, here are two swords. He said to them: It is enough.
042	LUK	022	039	And after he had gone out, he went, according to custom, to the mount of Olives; and his disciples followed him.
042	LUK	022	040	And when he came to the place, he said to them: Pray, that you enter not into temptation.
042	LUK	022	041	And he withdrew from them about a stone’s throw, and kneeled down, and prayed,
042	LUK	022	042	saying: Father, if thou art willing that this cup should pass from me―yet, not my will, but thine be done.
042	LUK	022	043	And there appeared to him an angel from heaven, to strengthen him.
042	LUK	022	044	And he was in agony, and prayed more earnestly. And his sweat was like great drops of blood falling to the ground.
042	LUK	022	045	And he arose from prayer, and came to his disciples, and found them asleep for sorrow.
042	LUK	022	046	And he said to them: Why do you sleep? Arise and pray, lest you enter into temptation.
042	LUK	022	047	And while he was yet speaking, behold a multitude; and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and came near to Jesus to kiss him.
042	LUK	022	048	But Jesus said to him: Judas, do you deliver up the Son of man with a kiss?
042	LUK	022	049	When those who were about him saw what would be done, they said to him: Lord, shall we strike with the sword?
042	LUK	022	050	And a certain one of them struck the servant of the chief priest, and cut off his right ear.
042	LUK	022	051	And Jesus answered and said: Let this matter proceed thus far. And he touched his ear and healed him.
042	LUK	022	052	And Jesus said to the chief priests, and the captains of the temple, and the elders that had come against him: Have you come out with swords and clubs, as against a robber?
042	LUK	022	053	While I was daily with you in the temple, you did not lay hands on me. But this is your hour, and the authority of darkness.
042	LUK	022	054	And they took him, and led him away, and brought him into the house of the chief priest. But Peter followed at a distance.
042	LUK	022	055	And when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the court, and had sat down together, Peter sat down in the midst of them.
042	LUK	022	056	And a certain maid-servant saw him sitting by the fire; and, looking intently at him, she said: This man also was with him.
042	LUK	022	057	But he denied, saying: Woman, I know him not.
042	LUK	022	058	And after a little, another saw him, and said: You also are one of them. Peter replied: Man, I am not.
042	LUK	022	059	And about one hour after, another confidently affirmed, saying: Of a truth, this man also was with him; for he is a Galilean.
042	LUK	022	060	But Peter said: Man, I know not what you say. And immediately, while he was speaking, the cock crew.
042	LUK	022	061	And the Lord turned and looked at Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, that he had said to him, Before the cock crows, you will deny me three times.
042	LUK	022	062	And Peter went out and wept bitterly.
042	LUK	022	063	And the men that had Jesus in custody mocked him, and smote him.
042	LUK	022	064	And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, and asked him, saying: Give a response; who is it that struck you?
042	LUK	022	065	And many other impious things they said to him.
042	LUK	022	066	And when it was day, the elders of the people, the chief priests also and scribes, met together, and led him up to the Sanhedrin, and said:
042	LUK	022	067	If you are the Christ, tell us. But he said to them: If I tell you, you will not believe;
042	LUK	022	068	and if I also ask you a question, you will not answer me, nor let me go.
042	LUK	022	069	Henceforth the Son of man shall sit on the right hand of the power of God.
042	LUK	022	070	And they all said: You are, then, the Son of God? He said to them: You say that I am.
042	LUK	022	071	They replied: What further need have we of testimony? For we ourselves have heard from his own mouth.
042	LUK	023	001	And the whole number of them arose, and led him away to Pilate.
042	LUK	023	002	And they began to accuse him, saying: We found this man turning the people away, and forbidding to give tribute to Cæsar, saying that he himself is Christ, a king.
042	LUK	023	003	And Pilate asked him, saying: Are you the king of the Jews? He answered and said to him: You say it.
042	LUK	023	004	Pilate said to the chief priests and to the multitudes: I find no fault in this man.
042	LUK	023	005	But they became the more urgent, and said: He excites the people, teaching throughout the whole of Judea, beginning from Galilee to this place.
042	LUK	023	006	When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked if the man was a Galilean.
042	LUK	023	007	And when he learned that he belonged to the dominion of Herod, he sent him to Herod, who was at that time in Jerusalem.
042	LUK	023	008	When Herod saw Jesus, he rejoiced greatly; for he had, for a long time, desired to see him, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to see some sign done by him.
042	LUK	023	009	And he questioned him concerning many things; but he made him no answer.
042	LUK	023	010	And the chief priests and the scribes stood by, and vehemently accused him.
042	LUK	023	011	But Herod and his guards treated him with contempt; and having mocked him, and put on him a gaudy robe, he sent him back to Pilate.
042	LUK	023	012	And on the same day, Pilate and Herod became friends to each other; for, before this, they had been at enmity the one toward the other.
042	LUK	023	013	And Pilate called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,
042	LUK	023	014	and said to them: You have brought to me this man as one that turns the people away; and behold, I have examined him before you, and have found in this man no fault, with respect to the things of which you accuse him;
042	LUK	023	015	nor indeed did Herod; for I sent you to him, and behold, nothing worthy of death has been done by him.
042	LUK	023	016	I will, therefore, chastise him, and release him.
042	LUK	023	017	For it was necessary that he should release to them one at the feast.
042	LUK	023	018	And the whole multitude cried out, saying: Away with this man, and release to us Barabbas.
042	LUK	023	019	He, for a certain seditious movement that had been made in the city, and for murder, had been thrown into prison.
042	LUK	023	020	Therefore Pilate, desiring to release Jesus, again called to them.
042	LUK	023	021	But they answered, saying: Crucify, crucify him.
042	LUK	023	022	He said to them the third time: Why, what evil has he done? I have found nothing in him worthy of death. I will, therefore, chastise him, and release him.
042	LUK	023	023	But they were urgent with loud voices, demanding that he should be crucified. And their voices, and those of the chief priests, prevailed.
042	LUK	023	024	And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they demanded.
042	LUK	023	025	And he released him that for a seditious movement, and for murder, had been thrown into prison, whom they demanded; but Jesus, he delivered up to their will.
042	LUK	023	026	And as they led him away, they laid hold of Simon, a certain Cyrenian, who was coming from the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might carry it after Jesus.
042	LUK	023	027	And there followed him a great number of the people, and of women that bewailed and lamented him.
042	LUK	023	028	But Jesus turned, and said to them, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.
042	LUK	023	029	For, behold, the days are coming in which they will say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never gave suck.
042	LUK	023	030	Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.
042	LUK	023	031	For, if they do these things in the green tree, what shall be done in the dry?
042	LUK	023	032	And two others, who were evil-doers, were led out to be put to death with him.
042	LUK	023	033	And when they came to the place called Skull, they there crucified him and the evil-doers; one on the right, and the other on the left.
042	LUK	023	034	And Jesus said: Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do. And dividing his clothing into parts, they cast lots.
042	LUK	023	035	And the people stood and looked on. And the rulers, with them scoffed at him, saying: He saved others, let him save himself if he is the Christ, the chosen of God.
042	LUK	023	036	The soldiers also derided him, coming to him and offering him vinegar,
042	LUK	023	037	and saying: If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself.
042	LUK	023	038	And a superscription was also written over him in Greek and in Roman and in Hebrew letters, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
042	LUK	023	039	And one of the evil-doers that were hanged reviled him, saying: If you are the Christ, save yourself and us.
042	LUK	023	040	But the other answering, rebuked him, saying: Do you not fear God, since you are in the same condemnation?
042	LUK	023	041	And we justly; for we are receiving the due reward of our deeds; but this man has done nothing wrong.
042	LUK	023	042	And he said to Jesus: Remember me, Lord, when thou comest in thy kingdom.
042	LUK	023	043	And Jesus said to him: Verily I say to you, to-day you shall be with me in paradise.
042	LUK	023	044	And it was about the sixth hour, and there was darkness over the whole land till the ninth hour.
042	LUK	023	045	And the sun was darkened, and the vail of the temple was rent in the midst.
042	LUK	023	046	And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and said: Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit. And when he had said this, he gave up his spirit.
042	LUK	023	047	When the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying: Truly, this was a righteous man.
042	LUK	023	048	And all the multitudes that had come together to that sight, when they saw what was done, returned, smiting their breasts.
042	LUK	023	049	And all his acquaintance, and the women that had followed him from Galilee, stood at a distance looking on these things.
042	LUK	023	050	And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a counselor, a good and a just man;
042	LUK	023	051	(he had not given his consent to their counsel and deed; ) he was of Arimathea, a city of the Jews, and he himself also waited for the kingdom of God:
042	LUK	023	052	this man came to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus.
042	LUK	023	053	And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulcher that had been hewed in rock, in which no one had yet been laid.
042	LUK	023	054	And the day was the preparation, and the sabbath was beginning.
042	LUK	023	055	And the women that had come with him from Galilee followed after and saw the sepulcher, and how his body was laid.
042	LUK	023	056	And they returned, and prepared spices and ointment; and they rested on the sabbath, according to the commandment.
042	LUK	024	001	And on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they came to the sepulcher, bringing the spices which they had prepared; and with them came certain others.
042	LUK	024	002	And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulcher;
042	LUK	024	003	and they entered in, but found not the body of the Lord Jesus.
042	LUK	024	004	And it came to pass, while they were much perplexed at this, behold, two men stood by them in shining raiment.
042	LUK	024	005	And while they feared and bowed their faces to the earth, they said to them: Why seek you among the dead for him that lives?
042	LUK	024	006	He is not here, but he has risen; remember that he spoke to you while he was yet in Galilee,
042	LUK	024	007	saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.
042	LUK	024	008	And they remembered his words,
042	LUK	024	009	and returned from the sepulcher, and told all these things to the eleven and to the rest.
042	LUK	024	010	It was Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James, and the others with them, that told these things to the apostles.
042	LUK	024	011	And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not.
042	LUK	024	012	But Peter arose and ran to the sepulcher, and stooping down, he saw the linen clothes lying by themselves; and he departed, wondering in himself at that which had come to pass.
042	LUK	024	013	And, behold, two of them were going, on the same day, to a village called Emmaus, distant from Jerusalem sixty furlongs.
042	LUK	024	014	And they were talking to one another about all these things which had taken place.
042	LUK	024	015	And it came to pass, that, while they conversed and reasoned together, Jesus himself drew near, and went on with them.
042	LUK	024	016	But their eyes were restrained, so that they did not recognize him.
042	LUK	024	017	And he said to them: What matters are these which you are discussing with one another as you walk and are sad?
042	LUK	024	018	And one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answered and said to him: Are you only a stranger in Jerusalem, and have not known the things that have taken place there in these days?
042	LUK	024	019	And he said to them: What things? They said to him: The things concerning Jesus the Nazarene, who was a prophet mighty in deed and in word before God and all the people;
042	LUK	024	020	and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him.
042	LUK	024	021	But we trusted that it was he that was about to redeem Israel. And besides all this, to-day is the third day since these things were done.
042	LUK	024	022	And further, certain women of our company, who were early at the sepulcher, astonished us:
042	LUK	024	023	for they found not his body, and came and told that they had seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive.
042	LUK	024	024	And some of those who were with us went to the sepulcher, and found it even as the women had said, but him they saw not.
042	LUK	024	025	And he said to them: O inconsiderate, and slow of heart to believe all things that the prophets have spoken!
042	LUK	024	026	Ought not the Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?
042	LUK	024	027	And beginning from Moses, and all the prophets, he explained to them, in all the Scriptures, the things concerning himself.
042	LUK	024	028	And they drew near the village to which they were going; and he made as if he would go further.
042	LUK	024	029	And they constrained him, saying: Remain with us, for it is near the evening, and the day has declined. And he went in to remain with them.
042	LUK	024	030	And it came to pass, while he reclined at table with them, that he took bread and blessed; and he broke, and gave it to them.
042	LUK	024	031	And their eyes were opened, and they recognized him, and he disappeared from them.
042	LUK	024	032	And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?
042	LUK	024	033	And they arose the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven, and those who were with them, assembled,
042	LUK	024	034	and saying: The Lord has risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon.
042	LUK	024	035	And they told what had taken place on the way, and how he was made known to them in the breaking of bread.
042	LUK	024	036	And while they were speaking of these things, Jesus him self stood in the midst of them, and said to them: Peace be to you.
042	LUK	024	037	But they were terrified and frightened, and thought that they saw a spirit.
042	LUK	024	038	And he said to them: Why are you troubled, and why do doubts arise in your hearts?
042	LUK	024	039	See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself; handle me and see; for a spirit has not flesh and bones, as you see me have.
042	LUK	024	040	And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet.
042	LUK	024	041	And while they did not believe as yet for joy, and were astonished, he said to them: Have you any thing here to eat?
042	LUK	024	042	And they gave him a piece of broiled fish, and of a honeycomb.
042	LUK	024	043	And he took it, and did eat before them.
042	LUK	024	044	And he said to them: These are the words that I spoke to you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled that are written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me.
042	LUK	024	045	Then he opened their mind, that they might understand the scriptures,
042	LUK	024	046	and he said to them: Thus it is written, and thus was it necessary that the Christ should suffer, and rise again from the dead the third day,
042	LUK	024	047	and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.
042	LUK	024	048	You are witnesses of these things.
042	LUK	024	049	And behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you. But do you remain in the city of Jerusalem, till you be clothed with power from on high.
042	LUK	024	050	And he led them out as far as Bethany; and he lifted up his hands and blessed them.
042	LUK	024	051	And it came to pass, that as he blessed them, he was separated from them, and carried up into heaven.
042	LUK	024	052	And they worshiped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy;
042	LUK	024	053	and were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God.

043	JOH	001	001	In the beginning was the WORD, and the WORD was with God, and the WORD was God.
043	JOH	001	002	He was in the beginning with God.
043	JOH	001	003	All things were made by him, and without him not one thing was made that now exists.
043	JOH	001	004	In him was life, and the life was the light of men.
043	JOH	001	005	And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness comprehends it not.
043	JOH	001	006	There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.
043	JOH	001	007	This man came as a witness, to testify of the Light, that all through him might believe.
043	JOH	001	008	He was not the Light; but he came to testify of the Light.
043	JOH	001	009	He was the true Light, which, coming into the world, gives light to every man.
043	JOH	001	010	He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.
043	JOH	001	011	He came to his own country, and his own people received him not.
043	JOH	001	012	But as many as received him, to them he gave the privilege of becoming the children of God, even to those who believe on his name;
043	JOH	001	013	who were begotten, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.
043	JOH	001	014	And the WORD became flesh, and tabernacled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, ) full of grace and of truth.
043	JOH	001	015	John testified of him, and cried, saying: This is he of whom I said: He that comes after me, is now before me, for he existed before me.
043	JOH	001	016	And from his fullness have we all received, even grace for grace;
043	JOH	001	017	for the law was given through Moses, but the grace and the truth came through Jesus Christ.
043	JOH	001	018	No one has seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he has revealed him.
043	JOH	001	019	And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him: Who are you?
043	JOH	001	020	And he confessed, and did not deny; and he confessed: I am not the Christ.
043	JOH	001	021	And they asked him: What then? Are you Elijah? And he said: I am not. Are you the prophet? And he answered: No.
043	JOH	001	022	They then said to him: Who are you? that we may give an answer to those who sent us; what say you of yourself?
043	JOH	001	023	He said: I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord; as said the prophet Isaiah.
043	JOH	001	024	And those who were sent were of the Pharisees;
043	JOH	001	025	and they asked him, and said to him: Why, then, do you immerse, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the prophet?
043	JOH	001	026	John answered them, saying: I immerse in water; but there stands one among you whom you know not.
043	JOH	001	027	He it is, who, though he comes after me, is now before me; the strap of whose sandal I am not worthy to loose.
043	JOH	001	028	These things were done in Bethany, beyond the Jordan, where John was immersing.
043	JOH	001	029	The next day John saw Jesus coming to him, and said: Behold the Lamb of God, that takes away the sin of the world.
043	JOH	001	030	This is he of whom I said, After me comes a man who is now before me, for he existed before me.
043	JOH	001	031	And I knew him not; but that he might be made manifest to Israel, for this reason I have come immersing in water.
043	JOH	001	032	And John testified, saying: I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it remained on him.
043	JOH	001	033	And I knew him not; but he that sent me to immerse in water, said to me, On whom you shall see the Spirit descending and remaining, this is he that immerses in the Holy Spirit.
043	JOH	001	034	And I saw, and do testify that this is the Son of God.
043	JOH	001	035	Again the next day, John was standing with two of his disciples.
043	JOH	001	036	And looking on Jesus as he walked, he said: Behold the Lamb of God.
043	JOH	001	037	And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.
043	JOH	001	038	And Jesus turned, and saw them following, and said to them:
043	JOH	001	039	What do you seek? They said to him: Rabbi, (which, when translated, is called Teacher, ) where abidest thou?
043	JOH	001	040	He said to them: Come and see. They went and saw where he abode; and they remained with him that day; for it was about the tenth hour.
043	JOH	001	041	One of the two that heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter.
043	JOH	001	042	He first found his own brother Simon, and said to him: We have found the Messiah; (which, when translated, is the Christ; )
043	JOH	001	043	and he brought him to Jesus. Jesus looking on him, said: You are Simon, the son of Jonah; you shall be called Cephas (which, when translated, is Rock).
043	JOH	001	044	The day following, Jesus wished to go into Galilee; and he found Philip, and said to him: Follow me.
043	JOH	001	045	Now, Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.
043	JOH	001	046	Philip found Nathaniel, and said to him: We have found him of whom Moses in the law and the prophets did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.
043	JOH	001	047	And Nathaniel said to him: Can any thing good come out of Nazareth? Philip said to him: Come and see.
043	JOH	001	048	Jesus saw Nathaniel coming to him, and said of him: Be hold, an Israelite in truth, in whom there is no guile.
043	JOH	001	049	Nathaniel said to him: How knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said to him: Before Philip called you, while you were under the fig-tree, I saw you.
043	JOH	001	050	Nathaniel answered and said to him: Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.
043	JOH	001	051	Jesus answered and said to him: Do you believe, because I said to you, I saw you under the fig-tree? You shall see greater things than these. And he said to him: Verily, verily I say to you, From this time you shall see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.
043	JOH	002	001	And on the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there.
043	JOH	002	002	And both Jesus and his disciples were invited to the marriage.
043	JOH	002	003	And the wine having failed, the mother of Jesus said to him: They have no wine.
043	JOH	002	004	Jesus said to her: Woman, what have I to do with you? my hour has not yet come.
043	JOH	002	005	His mother said to the servants: Whatever he says to you, do.
043	JOH	002	006	Now, according to the Jewish custom of purifying, six water-pots of stone had been set there, containing each two or three baths.
043	JOH	002	007	Jesus said to them: Fill the water-pots with water. And they filled them to the brim.
043	JOH	002	008	And he said to them: Draw out now, and carry it to the governor of the feast. And they carried it.
043	JOH	002	009	When the governor of the feast had tasted the water that had been made wine, (and he knew not whence it was, but the servants that had drawn the water knew, ) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom, and said to him:
043	JOH	002	010	Every man sets out the good wine first, and when they have drunk freely, then that which is inferior; but you have kept the good wino till now.
043	JOH	002	011	This beginning of signs Jesus made in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his glory; and his disciples believed on him.
043	JOH	002	012	After this he went down to Capernaum, he and his mother and his brothers and his disciples. And they continued there not many days.
043	JOH	002	013	And the passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
043	JOH	002	014	And he found in the temple those who were selling oxen and sheep and doves, and the money-changers sitting.
043	JOH	002	015	And when he had made a whip of cords, he drove them all out of the temple, the sheep also, and the oxen, and he poured out the money of the money-changers, and overthrew their tables;
043	JOH	002	016	and said to those who sold doves: Take these things hence; make not my Father’s house a house of merchandise.
043	JOH	002	017	And his disciples remembered that it was written, Zeal for thy house has eaten me up.
043	JOH	002	018	Then answered the Jews and said to him: What sign do you show us, seeing that you do these things?
043	JOH	002	019	Jesus answered and said to them: Destroy this temple, and I will raise it up in three days.
043	JOH	002	020	Then the Jews said to him: Forty and six years was this temple in building, and will you rebuild it in three days?
043	JOH	002	021	But he spoke of the temple of his body.
043	JOH	002	022	When, therefore, he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this. And they believed the scripture, and the word that Jesus had spoken.
043	JOH	002	023	And while he was in Jerusalem, during the feast of passover, many believed on his name, because they saw the signs that he did.
043	JOH	002	024	But Jesus did not trust himself to them, because he knew all men,
043	JOH	002	025	and had no need that any one should testify of man, for he himself knew what was in man.
043	JOH	003	001	There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.
043	JOH	003	002	This man came to Jesus by night, and said to him: Rabbi, we know that thou hast come as a teacher from God; for no man can do these signs which thou doest, unless God be with him.
043	JOH	003	003	Jesus answered and said to him: Verily, verily I say to you, unless a man be born again, he can not see the kingdom of God.
043	JOH	003	004	Nicodemus said to him: How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter his mother’s womb the second time, and be born?
043	JOH	003	005	Jesus answered: Verily, verily I say to you, unless a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he can not enter into the kingdom of God.
043	JOH	003	006	That which is begotten of the flesh, is flesh; and that which is begotten of the Spirit, is spirit.
043	JOH	003	007	Wonder not that I said to you, you must all be born again,
043	JOH	003	008	The Spirit breathes where he pleases, and you hear his voice, but you know not whence he comes, and whither he goes; so is every one that is begotten of the Spirit.
043	JOH	003	009	Nicodemus answered and said to him: How can these things be?
043	JOH	003	010	Jesus answered and said to him: Are you the teacher of Israel, and do not understand these things?
043	JOH	003	011	Verily, verily, I say to you, we speak that which we know, and testify to that which we have seen; and you receive not our testimony.
043	JOH	003	012	If I have told you of earthly things, and you believe not, how will you believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?
043	JOH	003	013	And no man has ascended into heaven, but he who came down from heaven, the Son of man, who is in heaven.
043	JOH	003	014	And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of man be lifted up;
043	JOH	003	015	that whoever believes on him may not perish, but have eternal life.
043	JOH	003	016	For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes on him should not perish, but have eternal life.
043	JOH	003	017	For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world, through him, might be saved.
043	JOH	003	018	He that believes on him is not condemned; but he that believes not is condemned already, because he has not believed on the name of the only begotten Son of God.
043	JOH	003	019	And this is the condemnation, that light has come into the world, and men have loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.
043	JOH	003	020	For every one that does evil, hates the light, and comes not to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed.
043	JOH	003	021	But he that does the truth, comes to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest that they are done in God.
043	JOH	003	022	After these things, Jesus and his disciples came into the land of Judea, and he remained there with them, and immersed.
043	JOH	003	023	And John also was immersing in Ænon, near Salim, because there was much water there. And they came and were immersed;
043	JOH	003	024	for John had not yet been thrown into prison.
043	JOH	003	025	There arose, therefore, a dispute between some of John’s disciples and a Jew, about purification.
043	JOH	003	026	And they came to John, and said to him: Rabbi, he who was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you bore testimony, behold, he immerses, and all are going to him.
043	JOH	003	027	John answered and said: A man can receive nothing unless it be given to him from heaven.
043	JOH	003	028	You yourselves will testify for me, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.
043	JOH	003	029	He that has the bride, is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly on account of the voice of the bridegroom. This, my joy, is therefore complete.
043	JOH	003	030	He must increase, but I must decrease.
043	JOH	003	031	He that comes from above, is over all. He that is from the earth, is from the earth, and speaks from the earth. He that comes from heaven, is over all;
043	JOH	003	032	and what he has seen and heard, this he testifies; and no one receives his testimony.
043	JOH	003	033	He that has received his testimony has solemnly declared that God is true.
043	JOH	003	034	For he whom God has sent, speaks the words of God; for God gives not the Spirit by measure to him.
043	JOH	003	035	The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his hand.
043	JOH	003	036	He that believes on the Son has eternal life. But he that believes not the Son, shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.
043	JOH	004	001	When, therefore, the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and immersing more disciples than John,
043	JOH	004	002	(though not Jesus himself, but his disciples immersed, )
043	JOH	004	003	he left Judea, and went again into Galilee.
043	JOH	004	004	And it was necessary that he should go through Samaria.
043	JOH	004	005	He came, therefore, to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near the field that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.
043	JOH	004	006	And Jacob’s well was there. Jesus, therefore, wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well. It was about the sixth hour.
043	JOH	004	007	There came a woman of Samaria to draw water. And Jesus said to her: Give me to drink.
043	JOH	004	008	For his disciples had gone into the city to buy food.
043	JOH	004	009	Then the woman of Samaria said to him: How is it that you, who are a Jew, ask drink of me, who am a woman of Samaria? (For the Jews have no social intercourse with the Samaritans.)
043	JOH	004	010	Jesus answered and said to her: If you had known the gift of God, and who it is that said to you, Give me to drink, you would have asked of him, and he would have given you living water.
043	JOH	004	011	The woman said to him: Sir, you have no vessel with which you can draw, and the well is deep; whence have you that living water?
043	JOH	004	012	Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank from it himself, and his sons, and his cattle?
043	JOH	004	013	Jesus answered and said to her: Whoever drinks of this water, will thirst again;
043	JOH	004	014	but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him, shall never thirst. But the water that I will give him, shall be in him a fountain of water springing up in order to eternal life.
043	JOH	004	015	The woman said to him: Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst, nor come hither to draw.
043	JOH	004	016	Jesus said to her: Go, call your husband, and come hither.
043	JOH	004	017	The woman answered and said: I have no husband. Jesus said to her: You have well said. I have no husband;
043	JOH	004	018	for you have had five husbands, and he whom you now have is not your husband. In this you have spoken truly.
043	JOH	004	019	The woman said to him: Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.
043	JOH	004	020	Our fathers worshiped in this mountain, and you Jews say that in Jerusalem is the place where we ought to worship.
043	JOH	004	021	Jesus said to her: Woman, believe me, the hour is coming, when neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, will you worship the Father.
043	JOH	004	022	You worship you know not what; we know what we worship; for salvation is of the Jews.
043	JOH	004	023	But the hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth; for the Father seeks such to worship him.
043	JOH	004	024	God is spirit; and they that worship him, must worship him in spirit and in truth.
043	JOH	004	025	The woman said to him: I know that Messiah (who is called Christ) is coming; when he comes, he will tell us all things.
043	JOH	004	026	Jesus said to her: I who speak to you am he.
043	JOH	004	027	And upon this his disciples came, and were astonished that he was talking with the woman. Yet no one said: What seekest thou? or, why talkest thou with her?
043	JOH	004	028	Then the woman left her water-pot, and went into the city, and said to the men:
043	JOH	004	029	Come, see a man who has told me all things that I ever did. Is not this the Christ?
043	JOH	004	030	Then they went out of the city and came to him.
043	JOH	004	031	In the mean time, the disciples besought him, saying: Rabbi, eat.
043	JOH	004	032	But he said to them: I have food to eat of which you know not.
043	JOH	004	033	Then the disciples said one to another: Has any one brought him food?
043	JOH	004	034	Jesus said to them: My food is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.
043	JOH	004	035	Do you not say, There are yet four months, and harvest comes? Behold, I say to you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields, for they are already white for the harvest.
043	JOH	004	036	And he that reaps receives wages, and gathers fruit for life eternal; that he that sows, and he that reaps, may rejoice together.
043	JOH	004	037	For in this is the saying true, One sows and another reaps.
043	JOH	004	038	I have sent you to reap that on which you bestowed no labor. Others have labored, and you have entered into their labors.
043	JOH	004	039	And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him, because of the word of the woman who testified, He told me all things that I ever did.
043	JOH	004	040	When, therefore, the Samaritans came to him, they besought him to abide with them. And he abode there two days.
043	JOH	004	041	And many more believed because of his own word;
043	JOH	004	042	and they said to the woman: We no longer believe because of what you said, for we ourselves have heard, and we know that this is in truth the Savior of the world, the Christ.
043	JOH	004	043	And after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee;
043	JOH	004	044	for Jesus himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country.
043	JOH	004	045	Therefore, when he came into Galilee, the Galileans received him, because they had seen all things that he had done in Jerusalem during the feast; for they themselves had gone to the feast.
043	JOH	004	046	Then Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he had made the water wine. And there was a certain courtier, whose sou was sick in Capernaum.
043	JOH	004	047	When he heard that Jesus had come from Judea into Galilee, he went to him, and besought him that he would come down, and restore his son to health, for he was about to die.
043	JOH	004	048	Then said Jesus to him: Unless you see signs and wonders, you will not believe.
043	JOH	004	049	The courtier said to him: Sir, come down before my child die.
043	JOH	004	050	Jesus said to him: Go, your child lives. And the man believed the word that Jesus spoke, and departed.
043	JOH	004	051	And as he was going down, his servants met him, and said: Your son lives.
043	JOH	004	052	Then he inquired of them the hour in which he was restored to health. And they said to him: Yesterday, at the seventh hour, the fever left him.
043	JOH	004	053	Then his father knew that it was in the same hour in which Jesus said to him, Your son lives. And he himself, and all his house, believed.
043	JOH	004	054	This is the second sign which Jesus did, when he came out of Judea into Galilee.
043	JOH	005	001	After this was the feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
043	JOH	005	002	Now there is in Jerusalem, near the sheep-gate, a pool, called, in the Hebrew tongue, Bethesda, with five porches.
043	JOH	005	003	In these lay a great multitude of sick persons, blind, lame, withered, who waited for the moving of the water.
043	JOH	005	004	For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and stirred the water. Then he who entered first after the motion of the water, was cured of whatever disease he had.
043	JOH	005	005	And a certain man was there, who had been sick thirty-eight years.
043	JOH	005	006	When Jesus saw him lying, and knew that he had been already a long time in that condition, he said to him: Do you wish to be restored to health?
043	JOH	005	007	The sick man answered him: Sir, I have no man to put me into the pool when the water is stirred; but while I am coming, another goes down before me.
043	JOH	005	008	Jesus said to him: Arise, take up your bed and walk.
043	JOH	005	009	And the man was immediately restored to health; and he took up his bed and walked. And that day was the sabbath.
043	JOH	005	010	The Jews, therefore, said to him that was cured: It is the sabbath; it is not lawful for you to carry your bed.
043	JOH	005	011	He answered them: He that restored me to health said to me, Take up your bed and walk.
043	JOH	005	012	Then they asked him: Who is he that said to you, Take up your bed and walk?
043	JOH	005	013	But he that had been restored to health knew not who he was; for Jesus had withdrawn himself, because a multitude was in the place.
043	JOH	005	014	After this Jesus found him in the temple, and said to him: Behold, you have been restored to health; sin no more, lest some worse thing befall you.
043	JOH	005	015	The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus that had restored him to health.
043	JOH	005	016	And for this reason did the Jews persecute Jesus, and seek to kill him, because he had done these things on the sabbath.
043	JOH	005	017	But Jesus answered them: My Father works till now, and I also work.
043	JOH	005	018	For this reason, therefore, the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he had not only broken the sabbath, but also said that God was his own father, making himself equal with God.
043	JOH	005	019	Then Jesus answered and said to them: Verily, verily I say to you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he sees the Father do; for whatever things he does, these also the Son does in like manner.
043	JOH	005	020	For the Father loves the Son, and shows him all things that he himself does; and he will show him greater works than these, that you may be astonished.
043	JOH	005	021	For as the Father raises the dead, and makes them alive, so also the Son makes alive whom he will.
043	JOH	005	022	For the Father judges no one, but has given all judicial authority to the Son;
043	JOH	005	023	that all may honor the Son, as they honor the Father. He that honors not the Son, honors not the Father who sent him.
043	JOH	005	024	Verily, verily I say to you, He that hears my word, and believes on him that sent me, has eternal life, and comes not into condemnation, but has passed from death into life.
043	JOH	005	025	Verily, verily I say to you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear, shall live.
043	JOH	005	026	For as the Father has life in himself, so has he given to the Son also to have life in himself;
043	JOH	005	027	and he has given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.
043	JOH	005	028	Be not astonished at this; for the hour is coming in which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,
043	JOH	005	029	and shall come forth; those who have done good, to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of condemnation.
043	JOH	005	030	I can of myself do nothing. As I hear, I judge; and my judgment is just, because I seek not my own will, but the will of him that sent me.
043	JOH	005	031	If I testify concerning myself, my testimony is not worthy of credit.
043	JOH	005	032	There is another that testifies concerning me, and I know that the testimony which he testifies concerning me is worthy of credit.
043	JOH	005	033	You sent to John, and he bore testimony to the truth.
043	JOH	005	034	But I receive not testimony from man; yet I say these things that you may be saved.
043	JOH	005	035	He was the burning and shining lamp; and you were willing, for a time, to rejoice in his light.
043	JOH	005	036	But I have testimony greater than that of John; for the works which the Father has given me to finish, these very works which I do, testify concerning me, that the Father has sent me.
043	JOH	005	037	And the Father, who sent me, has testified concerning me. You have, neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.
043	JOH	005	038	And his word you have not remaining in you; for whom he has sent, him you believe not.
043	JOH	005	039	You search the scriptures, because in them you think you have eternal life; and these are they which testify concerning me:
043	JOH	005	040	and yet you refuse to come to me, that you may have life.
043	JOH	005	041	I receive not honor from men.
043	JOH	005	042	But I know you, that you have not the love of God in you.
043	JOH	005	043	I have come in my Father’s name, and you receive me not; if another should come in his own name, him you would receive.
043	JOH	005	044	How can you believe who receive honor one from another, and seek not the honor that comes from God alone?
043	JOH	005	045	Think not that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuses you, Moses, in whom you trust.
043	JOH	005	046	For if you had believed Moses, you would have believed me; for he wrote of me.
043	JOH	005	047	But if you believe not his writings, how shall you believe my words?
043	JOH	006	001	After these things Jesus went away to the other side of the sea of Galilee, which is the sea of Tiberias.
043	JOH	006	002	And a great multitude followed him, because they had seen the signs which he did in the case of the sick.
043	JOH	006	003	And Jesus went up into the mountain, and sat there with his disciples.
043	JOH	006	004	And the passover, the feast of the Jews, was near.
043	JOH	006	005	Then Jesus, lifting up his eyes, and seeing that a great multitude was coming to him, said to Philip: Whence shall we buy bread that these may eat?
043	JOH	006	006	But this he said to try him; for he himself knew what he was about to do.
043	JOH	006	007	Philip answered him: Two hundred denarii worth of bread is not enough for them, that each may take a little.
043	JOH	006	008	One of his disciples, Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, said to him:
043	JOH	006	009	There is a lad here that has five barley loaves, and two little fishes; but what are these among so many?
043	JOH	006	010	But Jesus said: Make die men recline. Now, there was much grass in the place. So the men reclined, in number about five thousand.
043	JOH	006	011	And Jesus took the loaves, and after giving thanks, distributed them to the disciples, and the disciples to those who had reclined; and in like manner of the fishes, as much as they wished.
043	JOH	006	012	And when they were satisfied, he said to his disciples: Gather up the broken pieces which remain, that nothing be lost.
043	JOH	006	013	Then they gathered them up, and filled twelve baskets with the broken pieces of the five barley loaves, which remained after they had eaten.
043	JOH	006	014	Then the men, after having seen the sign which Jesus did, said: This is, in truth, the prophet that was to come into the world.
043	JOH	006	015	Therefore, Jesus perceiving that they were about to come and take him by force, to make him king, withdrew into the mountain himself alone.
043	JOH	006	016	And when evening had come, his disciples went down to the sea,
043	JOH	006	017	and, having entered the ship, went across the sea toward Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus had not come to them.
043	JOH	006	018	And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that was blowing.
043	JOH	006	019	Then, having rowed about twenty-five or thirty furlongs, they saw Jesus walking on the sea, and coming near the ship; and they were afraid.
043	JOH	006	020	But he said to them: It is I; be not afraid.
043	JOH	006	021	Then they willingly received him into the ship; and immediately the ship was at the land to which they were going.
043	JOH	006	022	The next day, the multitude that stood on the other side of the sea, seeing that no other boat had been there but the one which his disciples had entered, and that Jesus had not entered the boat with his disciples, but that his disciples had gone away alone;
043	JOH	006	023	(but there came other boats from Tiberias near the place where they had eaten bread, after the Lord had given thanks; )
043	JOH	006	024	when, therefore, the multitude saw that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they also entered the ships, and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.
043	JOH	006	025	And finding him on the opposite side of the sea, they said to him: Rabbi, when didst thou come hither?
043	JOH	006	026	Jesus answered them, and said: Verily, verily I say to you, You seek me, not because you saw the signs, but because you ate of the loaves, and were satisfied.
043	JOH	006	027	Labor not for the food that perishes, but for the food that endures to life eternal, which the Son of man will give you; for him has God the Father attested.
043	JOH	006	028	Then they said to him: What shall we do, that we may work the works of God?
043	JOH	006	029	Jesus answered and said to them: This is the work of God, that you believe on him whom he has sent.
043	JOH	006	030	Therefore, they said to him: What sign do you show, then, that we may see, and believe you? What work do you perform?
043	JOH	006	031	Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.
043	JOH	006	032	Then Jesus said to them: Verily, verily I say to you, Moses did not give you the bread from heaven; but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven.
043	JOH	006	033	For the bread of God is he who comes down from heaven, and gives life for the world.
043	JOH	006	034	Then they said to him: Lord, evermore give us this bread.
043	JOH	006	035	Jesus said to them: I am the bread of life; he that comes to me shall never hunger; he that believes on me shall never thirst.
043	JOH	006	036	But I said to you, that you have seen me, and yet you do not believe.
043	JOH	006	037	All that the Father gives me, will come to me; and him that comes to me, I will by no means cast out.
043	JOH	006	038	For I came down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him that sent me.
043	JOH	006	039	And this is the will of him who sent me, that of all that he gives me, I shall lose nothing, but shall raise it up at the last day.
043	JOH	006	040	For this is the will of him that sent me, that every one who sees the Son, and believes on him, may have eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.
043	JOH	006	041	Then the Jews murmured at him, because he said, I am like bread that came down from heaven.
043	JOH	006	042	And they said: Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How, then, does he say, I came down from heaven?
043	JOH	006	043	Jesus answered and said to them: Murmur not among yourselves;
043	JOH	006	044	no man can come to me, unless the Father, who sent me, draw him; and I will raise him up at the last day.
043	JOH	006	045	It is written in the prophets, And they shall all be taught of God. Every one that hears from the Father, and learns, comes to me.
043	JOH	006	046	Not that any one has seen the Father, but he who is from God; he has seen the Father.
043	JOH	006	047	Verily, verily I say to you, He that believes on me has eternal life.
043	JOH	006	048	I am the bread of life.
043	JOH	006	049	Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and died.
043	JOH	006	050	This is the bread which comes down from heaven, that any one may eat of it, and not die.
043	JOH	006	051	I am the bread that lives, which came down from heaven. If any one eat of this bread, he shall live forever. And the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.
043	JOH	006	052	The Jews, therefore, contended among themselves, saying: How can this man give us his flesh to eat?
043	JOH	006	053	Then Jesus said to them: Verily, verily I say to you, Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, you have no life in you.
043	JOH	006	054	He that eats my flesh and drinks my blood, has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day;
043	JOH	006	055	for my flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.
043	JOH	006	056	He that eats my flesh and drinks my blood, dwells in me, and I in him.
043	JOH	006	057	As the living Father has sent me, and I live by the Father, so he that eats me, even he shall live by me.
043	JOH	006	058	This is the bread that came down from heaven; not as your fathers ate the manna, and died; he that eats this bread shall live forever.
043	JOH	006	059	These things he spoke in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.
043	JOH	006	060	Therefore, many of his disciples, when they heard him, said: This is a hard saying; who can hear it?
043	JOH	006	061	But Jesus, knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at it, said to them: Does this offend you?
043	JOH	006	062	Then, what if you should see the Son of man go up where he was before?
043	JOH	006	063	It is the spirit that makes alive; the flesh profits nothing; the words that I speak to you are spirit and life.
043	JOH	006	064	But there are some among you who believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who he was that would betray him.
043	JOH	006	065	And he said: For this reason I said to you: No one can come to me unless it be given him from my Father.
043	JOH	006	066	After this, many of his disciples went back, and walked with him no more.
043	JOH	006	067	Then Jesus said to the twelve: Will you also go away?
043	JOH	006	068	Simon Peter answered him: Lord, to whom shall we go? Thou hast the words of eternal life;
043	JOH	006	069	and we believe, and know that thou art the Christ, the Son of God.
043	JOH	006	070	Jesus answered them: Have I not chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?
043	JOH	006	071	He spoke of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon; for he was about to deliver him up, being one of the twelve.
043	JOH	007	001	And after this Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him.
043	JOH	007	002	Now the feast of tabernacles, a feast of the Jews, was near.
043	JOH	007	003	Then his brothers said to him: Depart hence, and go into Judea, that your disciples may see your works which you do;
043	JOH	007	004	for no one does any thing in secret, while he himself seeks to be before the public. If you do these things, show yourself to the world.
043	JOH	007	005	For neither did his brothers believe on him.
043	JOH	007	006	Then Jesus said to them: My time has not yet come; but your time is always ready.
043	JOH	007	007	The world can not hate you; but me it hates, because I testify of it, that its works are evil.
043	JOH	007	008	Do you go up to this feast. I go not up now to this feast, because my time has not yet fully come.
043	JOH	007	009	These things said he to them, and remained in Galilee.
043	JOH	007	010	But when his brothers had gone up, then he also went up to the feast, not openly, but, as it were, in secret.
043	JOH	007	011	Then the Jews sought for him at the feast, and said: Where is he?
043	JOH	007	012	And there was much murmuring among the multitudes concerning him. Some said: He is a good man. Others said: No; but he deceives the multitude.
043	JOH	007	013	However, no one spoke openly of him, for fear of the Jews.
043	JOH	007	014	Now in the middle of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.
043	JOH	007	015	And the Jews were astonished, and said: How has this man a knowledge of letters, having never been taught?
043	JOH	007	016	Then Jesus answered and said: My teaching is not mine, but his who sent me.
043	JOH	007	017	If any one will do his will, he shall know with respect to the teaching, whether it is of God, or I speak of myself.
043	JOH	007	018	He who speaks of himself, seeks his own glory; he who seeks the glory of him that sent him, he is true, and there is no unrighteousness in him.
043	JOH	007	019	Did not Moses give you the law? and not one of you keeps the law. Why do you seek to kill me?
043	JOH	007	020	The multitude answered and said: You have a demon: who seeks to kill you?
043	JOH	007	021	Jesus answered and said to them: I have done one work, and you are all astonished on account of this.
043	JOH	007	022	Moses gave you circumcision, (not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers, ) and you circumcise a man on the sabbath-day.
043	JOH	007	023	If a man receives circumcision on the sabbath-day, that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with me, because I have restored the entire man to health on the sabbath-day?
043	JOH	007	024	Judge not according to appearance, but judge righteous judgment.
043	JOH	007	025	Then said some of the men of Jerusalem: Is not this he whom they seek to kill?
043	JOH	007	026	and, lo, he is speaking boldly, and they say nothing to him. Have the rulers really learned that this is the Christ?
043	JOH	007	027	But we know this man, whence he is. But when the Christ comes, no one knows whence he is.
043	JOH	007	028	Then Jesus cried out in the temple, as he was teaching, and said: You both know me, and you know whence I am; and I have not come of myself, but he who sent me is true, whom you know not.
043	JOH	007	029	But I know him, because I am from him, and he has sent me.
043	JOH	007	030	Then they sought to take him; yet no one laid his hand on him, because his hour had not yet come.
043	JOH	007	031	And many of the multitude believed on him, and said: When the Christ comes, will he do more signs than these which this man has done?
043	JOH	007	032	The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and chief priests sent attendants to take him.
043	JOH	007	033	Then Jesus said to them: Yet a little while I am with you, and I go away to him that sent me.
043	JOH	007	034	You will seek me, and shall not find me; and where I am, you can not come.
043	JOH	007	035	Then the Jews said among themselves: Whither is this man about to go, that we shall not find him? Is he about to go to those who are dispersed among the Greeks, and to teach the Greeks?
043	JOH	007	036	What means this saying which he uttered, You will seek me, and will not find me; and, Where I am you can not come?
043	JOH	007	037	On the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying: If any one thirst, let him come to me and drink.
043	JOH	007	038	He that believes on me, as the scripture has said, from his inner self shall flow rivers of living water.
043	JOH	007	039	But this he spoke of the Spirit, which those who believe on him were about to receive; for the Holy Spirit had not yet been given, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.
043	JOH	007	040	Therefore, many of the multitude, when they had heard this word, said: This is, in truth, the prophet.
043	JOH	007	041	Others said: This is the Christ. But others said: Does the Christ come out of Galilee?
043	JOH	007	042	Has not the scripture said that the Christ comes from the posterity of David, and from Bethlehem, the town where David was?
043	JOH	007	043	So there was a division among the multitude because of him.
043	JOH	007	044	And some of them desired to take him; but no one laid hands on him.
043	JOH	007	045	Then came the attendants to the chief priests and the Pharisees; and they said to them: Why have you not brought him?
043	JOH	007	046	The attendants answered: Never did man speak like this man.
043	JOH	007	047	Then the Pharisees answered them: Are you also deceived?
043	JOH	007	048	Has any one of the rulers, or of the Pharisees believed on him?
043	JOH	007	049	But this multitude that know not the law are cursed.
043	JOH	007	050	Nicodemus said to them (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them):
043	JOH	007	051	Does our law condemn a man unless it first hear from him, and know what he does?
043	JOH	007	052	They answered and said to him: Are you also from Galilee? Search, and see that out of Galilee arises no prophet.
043	JOH	007	053	And every one departed to his own house.
043	JOH	008	001	But Jesus went to the mount of Olives.
043	JOH	008	002	And in the morning he again entered the temple, and all the people came to him, and he sat down and taught them.
043	JOH	008	003	And the scribes and Pharisees brought to him a woman who had been detected in adultery; and they made her stand in the midst,
043	JOH	008	004	and said to him: Teacher, this woman was detected in adultery; in the very act.
043	JOH	008	005	Now Moses, in his law, commanded us, that such should be stoned; but what say you?
043	JOH	008	006	This they said to tempt him, that they might bring an accusation against him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground.
043	JOH	008	007	But as they continued to ask him, he stood up, and said to them: Let him among you who is without sin, first throw a stone at her.
043	JOH	008	008	And again he stooped down and wrote on the ground.
043	JOH	008	009	But having heard him, and being convicted by their conscience, they went out, one by one, beginning from the oldest, even to the last. And Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.
043	JOH	008	010	And when Jesus stood up, and saw no one but the woman, he said to her: Woman, where are those who accused you? Has no one condemned you?
043	JOH	008	011	She said: No one, sir. Jesus said to her: Neither do I condemn you; go, and sin no more.
043	JOH	008	012	Then Jesus spoke to them again, saying: I am the light of the world; he that follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.
043	JOH	008	013	Then the Pharisees said to him: You testify concerning yourself; your testimony is not worthy of credit.
043	JOH	008	014	Jesus answered and said to them: Though I testify concerning myself, my testimony is worthy of credit; for I know whence I came, and whither I go. But you know not whence I came, and whither I go.
043	JOH	008	015	You judge according to the flesh; I judge no man.
043	JOH	008	016	And yet if I judge, my judgment is true, because I am not alone, but I and the Father who sent me.
043	JOH	008	017	It is also written in your law, The testimony of two is worthy of credit.
043	JOH	008	018	I am one that testify concerning myself, and the Father who sent me, testifies of me.
043	JOH	008	019	Then they said to him: Where is your Father? Jesus answered: You know neither me, nor my Father. If you had known me, you would have known my Father also.
043	JOH	008	020	These words Jesus spoke in the treasury, as he taught in the temple; and no one laid hands on him, because his hour had not yet come.
043	JOH	008	021	Then spoke Jesus to them again; I go away, and you will seek me, and in your sin you shall die; whither I go, you can not come.
043	JOH	008	022	Then said the Jews: Will he kill himself, because he says, Whither I go, you can not come?
043	JOH	008	023	And he said to them: You are from beneath, I am from above; you are of this world, I am not of this world.
043	JOH	008	024	Therefore said I to you, that you shall die in your sins. For if you believe not that I am, He, you shall die in your sins.
043	JOH	008	025	Then they said to him: Who are you? And Jesus said to them: The same that I said to you at the beginning.
043	JOH	008	026	I have many things to say, and to judge with respect to you; but he that sent me is true; and what things I have heard from him, these I speak to the world.
043	JOH	008	027	They knew not that he was speaking to them of the Father.
043	JOH	008	028	Then said Jesus to them: When you have lifted up the Son of man, then you will know that I am He, and that I do nothing of myself, but as the Father has taught me I speak these things.
043	JOH	008	029	And he that sent me is with me. The Father has not left me alone, because I always do what is pleasing to him.
043	JOH	008	030	While he was speaking these words, many believed on him.
043	JOH	008	031	Then said Jesus to those Jews that believed on him: If you continue in my word, you are my disciples indeed,
043	JOH	008	032	and you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.
043	JOH	008	033	They answered him: We are the posterity of Abraham, and have never been in bondage to any one. How say you, You shall be made free?
043	JOH	008	034	Jesus answered them: Verily, verily I say to you, whoever works sin is the servant of sin.
043	JOH	008	035	The servant continues not in the house forever; but the Son continues forever.
043	JOH	008	036	Therefore, if the Son make you free, you shall be free indeed.
043	JOH	008	037	I know that you are the posterity of Abraham; yet you seek to kill me, because my word has no place in you.
043	JOH	008	038	I speak what I have seen with my Father, and you do what you have seen with your father.
043	JOH	008	039	They answered and said to him: Abra ham is our father. Jesus said to them: If you were the children of Abraham, you would do the works of Abraham.
043	JOH	008	040	But now you seek to kill me, a man that has spoken to you the truth, which I have heard from God; this Abraham did not.
043	JOH	008	041	You do the works of your father. They said to him: We were not born of lewdness; we have one father, God.
043	JOH	008	042	Jesus said to them: If God were your father, you would love me; for I came forth from God and have come hither; nor, indeed, did I come of myself, but he sent me.
043	JOH	008	043	Why do you not know what I say? Because you can not understand my words.
043	JOH	008	044	You are of your father, the devil; and the desires of your father you will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and stood not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks that which is false, he speaks from what is his own; for he is a liar, and the father of it.
043	JOH	008	045	But because I speak the truth, you believe me not.
043	JOH	008	046	Which of you convicts me of sin? If I speak the truth, why do you not believe me?
043	JOH	008	047	He that is of God, hears God’s words. For this reason you do not hear them, because you are not of God.
043	JOH	008	048	The Jews answered, and said to him: Do we not well say that you are a Samaritan, and have a demon?
043	JOH	008	049	Jesus answered: I have not a demon; but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me.
043	JOH	008	050	I seek not my own glory; there is one that seeks and judges.
043	JOH	008	051	Verily, verily I say to you, if any one will keep my word, he shall never see death.
043	JOH	008	052	Then said the Jews to him: Now we know that you have a demon. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and you say, If a man keep my word, he shall never taste of death.
043	JOH	008	053	Are you greater than our father Abraham, who is dead? And the prophets are dead; whom do you make yourself?
043	JOH	008	054	Jesus answered: If I honor myself, my honor is nothing; it is my Father that honors me, of whom you say, that he is your God.
043	JOH	008	055	And yet you have not known him. But I know him; and if I should say that I do not know him, I should be like yourselves, a liar. But I know him, and I keep his word.
043	JOH	008	056	Abraham, your father, rejoiced that he could see my day; and he saw it, and was glad.
043	JOH	008	057	Then the Jews said to him: You are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen Abraham?
043	JOH	008	058	Jesus said to them: Verily, verily I say to you, before Abraham came into being, I was.
043	JOH	008	059	Then they took up stones to throw at him. But Jesus concealed himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them; and so passed by.
043	JOH	009	001	And as he passed by, he saw a man that had been blind from his birth.
043	JOH	009	002	And his disciples asked him, saying: Rabbi, who sinned, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?
043	JOH	009	003	Jesus answered: Neither this man sinned, nor his parents; but that the works of God might be made manifest in him.
043	JOH	009	004	I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day; the night comes, when no man can work.
043	JOH	009	005	While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.
043	JOH	009	006	Having said this, he spit on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and spread the clay on the eyes of the blind man,
043	JOH	009	007	and said to him: Go, wash in the pool of Siloam; which, translated, means Sent. He went, therefore, and washed and came seeing.
043	JOH	009	008	Then his neighbors, and those who had before seen him, that he was blind, said: Is not this he that sat and begged?
043	JOH	009	009	Some said: It is he. Others: He is like him. But he said: I am he.
043	JOH	009	010	Then they said to him: How were your eyes opened?
043	JOH	009	011	He answered and said: A man called Jesus made clay and spread it on my eyes, and said to me: Go to the pool of Siloam and wash. After I had gone and washed, I received my sight.
043	JOH	009	012	Then they said to him: Where is he? He said: I know not.
043	JOH	009	013	They brought to the Pharisees him that had formerly been blind.
043	JOH	009	014	And it was the sabbath when Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes.
043	JOH	009	015	Then again the Pharisees also inquired of him how he had received his sight. He said to them: He put clay on my eyes, and I washed, and I see.
043	JOH	009	016	Then some of the Pharisees said: This man is not from God, for he keeps not the sabbath. Others said: How can a man that is a sinner do such signs? And there was a division among them?
043	JOH	009	017	Again they said to the blind man: What say you of him, seeing that he opened your eyes? He said: He is a prophet.
043	JOH	009	018	The Jews did not, therefore, believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and had received his sight, till they called the parents of him that had received his sight,
043	JOH	009	019	and asked them, saying: Is this your son, who, you say, was born blind? How, then, does he now see?
043	JOH	009	020	His parents answered them, and said: We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind;
043	JOH	009	021	but how he now sees we know not; or who opened his eyes we know not. He is of age; ask him; he will speak for himself.
043	JOH	009	022	His parents said this, because they feared the Jews. For the Jews had already agreed, that if any one should confess him to be the Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.
043	JOH	009	023	For this reason his parents said: He is of age; ask him.
043	JOH	009	024	Then, the second time, they called the man who had been blind, and said to him: Give glory to God; we know that this man is a sinner.
043	JOH	009	025	He answered and said: If he is a sinner, I know it not. One thing I do know, that having been blind, I now see.
043	JOH	009	026	They said to him again: What did he for you? How did he open your eyes?
043	JOH	009	027	He answered them: I have already told you, and you did not understand; why would you hear it again? Do you also wish to become his disciples?
043	JOH	009	028	They reviled him, and said: You are the disciple of that man; but we are the disciples of Moses.
043	JOH	009	029	We know that God spoke to Moses; but as for this man, we know not whence he is.
043	JOH	009	030	The man answered and said to them: Why, there is something wonderful in this, that you know not whence he is, and yet he has opened my eyes.
043	JOH	009	031	We know that God hears not sinners; but if any one be a worshiper of God, and do his will, him he hears.
043	JOH	009	032	Since the beginning it has not been heard that any one opened the eyes of one who had been born blind.
043	JOH	009	033	If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.
043	JOH	009	034	They answered and said to him: You were wholly born in sins, and do you teach us? And they cast him out.
043	JOH	009	035	Jesus heard that they had cast him out. And having found him, he said to him: Do you believe on the Son of God?
043	JOH	009	036	He answered and said: Who is he, sir, that I may believe on him?
043	JOH	009	037	Jesus said to him: You have seen him; and it is he that talks with you.
043	JOH	009	038	He said: Lord, I believe; and he worshiped him.
043	JOH	009	039	And Jesus said: For judgment have I come into this world, that those who see not, may see; and that those who see, may become blind.
043	JOH	009	040	And some of the Pharisees who were with him, heard these things, and said to him: Are we also blind?
043	JOH	009	041	Jesus said to them: If you were blind, you would not have sin; but now you say, We see; therefore your sin remains.
043	JOH	010	001	Verily, verily I say to you, he that goes not through the door into the sheepfold, but climbs up some other way, he is a thief, and a robber.
043	JOH	010	002	But he that enters through the door, is the shepherd of the sheep.
043	JOH	010	003	To him the door-keeper opens; and the sheep hear his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out.
043	JOH	010	004	And when he puts his own sheep out, he goes before them; and the sheep follow him; for they know his voice.
043	JOH	010	005	And a stranger they will not follow, but will flee from him; for they know not the voice of strangers.
043	JOH	010	006	This parable spoke Jesus to them; but they knew not the meaning of the things which he spoke to them.
043	JOH	010	007	Therefore Jesus spoke again to them: Verily, verily I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.
043	JOH	010	008	All that came before me were thieves and robbers; but the sheep did not hear them.
043	JOH	010	009	I am the door: if any one enters through me, he shall be saved; and he shall go in and out, and find pasture.
043	JOH	010	010	The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I have come that they may have life, and have it in abundance.
043	JOH	010	011	I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.
043	JOH	010	012	But he that is a hireling, and not the shepherd, to whom the sheep do not belong, sees the wolf coming, and leaves the sheep, and flees; and the wolf catches the sheep, and scatters them.
043	JOH	010	013	The hireling flees because he is a hireling, and cares not for the sheep.
043	JOH	010	014	I am the good shepherd, and I know my sheep, and am known by mine.
043	JOH	010	015	As the Father knows me, I also know the Father, and I lay down my life for the sheep.
043	JOH	010	016	And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold; those, also, must I bring, and they will hear my voice: and there shall be one flock, one shepherd.
043	JOH	010	017	For this reason, my Father loves me, because I lay down my life that I may take it again.
043	JOH	010	018	No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it again. This commandment I have received from my Father.
043	JOH	010	019	Again, therefore, there was a division among the Jews, on account of these words.
043	JOH	010	020	And many of them said: He has a demon, and is mad; why do you hear him?
043	JOH	010	021	Others said: These are not the words of one that has a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?
043	JOH	010	022	And the feast of the dedication was celebrated in Jerusalem, and it was winter:
043	JOH	010	023	and Jesus was walking in the temple, in Solomon’s porch.
043	JOH	010	024	Then the Jews came round him, and said to him: How long do you keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.
043	JOH	010	025	Jesus answered them: I have told you, and you do not believe. The works which I do in my Father’s name, these testify of me.
043	JOH	010	026	But you believe not, because you are not of my sheep. As I said to you,
043	JOH	010	027	my sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:
043	JOH	010	028	and I give them eternal life; and they shall never perish, and no one shall take them out of my hand.
043	JOH	010	029	My Father, who gave them to me, is greater than all; and no one is able to take them out of my Father’s hand.
043	JOH	010	030	I and my Father are one.
043	JOH	010	031	Then the Jews took up stones again, to stone him.
043	JOH	010	032	Jesus answered them: Many good works have I showed you from my Father: for which of these works do you stone me?
043	JOH	010	033	The Jews answered and said to him: We do not stone you for a good work, but for your impious words; and because you, being man, make yourself God.
043	JOH	010	034	Jesus answered them: Is it not written in your law, I said, you are gods?
043	JOH	010	035	If he called them gods, to whom the word of God was committed, (and the scripture can not be made void, )
043	JOH	010	036	do you say of him, whom the Father has sanctified, and sent into the world, You speak impiously, because I said, I am the Son of God?
043	JOH	010	037	If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not;
043	JOH	010	038	but if I do, though you believe not me, believe the works, that you may know and believe that the Father is in me, and I in him.
043	JOH	010	039	Then they sought again to take him, but he escaped from their hands.
043	JOH	010	040	And he went away again beyond the Jordan, to the place where John first immersed, and there he abode.
043	JOH	010	041	And many came to him, and said: John did no sign; but all things that John said of this man were true.
043	JOH	010	042	And many who were there believed on him.
043	JOH	011	001	Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus, of Bethany, the village of Mary and Martha her sister.
043	JOH	011	002	It was the Mary that anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.
043	JOH	011	003	Therefore his sisters sent to him, saying: Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.
043	JOH	011	004	But when Jesus heard it, he said: This sickness is not to death, but for the glory of God, that by it the Son of God may be glorified.
043	JOH	011	005	Now, Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.
043	JOH	011	006	When, therefore, he heard that he was sick, he still remained two days in the place where he was.
043	JOH	011	007	Then after this, he said to his disciples: Let us go into Judea again.
043	JOH	011	008	His disciples said to him: Rabbi, the Jews just now sought to stone thee, and art thou going thither again?
043	JOH	011	009	Jesus answered: Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any one walks during the day, he does not stumble, for he sees the light of this world.
043	JOH	011	010	But if any one walks in the night, he stumbles, because there is no light in him.
043	JOH	011	011	Thus spoke he; and after this he said to them: Our friend Lazarus sleeps; but I go that I may awake him out of sleep.
043	JOH	011	012	Then his disciples said: Lord, if he sleeps, he will be saved.
043	JOH	011	013	Jesus spoke of his death; but they thought that he spoke of taking rest in sleep.
043	JOH	011	014	Therefore, Jesus then said to them plainly: Lazarus is dead.
043	JOH	011	015	And I rejoice, on your account, that I was not there, in order that you may believe. But let us go to him.
043	JOH	011	016	Then Thomas, who is called Didymus, said to his fellow-disciples: Let us also go, that we may die with him.
043	JOH	011	017	Then when Jesus came, he found that he had already been four days in the tomb.
043	JOH	011	018	Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off.
043	JOH	011	019	And many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.
043	JOH	011	020	Then Martha, when she heard that Jesus was coming, went out to meet him; but Mary sat still in the house.
043	JOH	011	021	Then Martha said to Jesus: Lord, if thou hadst been here my brother would not have died.
043	JOH	011	022	But even now, I know that whatever thou wilt ask of God, God will give thee.
043	JOH	011	023	Jesus said to her: Your brother shall rise again.
043	JOH	011	024	Martha said to him: I know that he will rise, in the resurrection at the last day.
043	JOH	011	025	Jesus said to her: I am the resurrection, and the life; he that believes on me, though he were dead, yet shall he live;
043	JOH	011	026	and he that lives and believes on me, shall never die. Do you believe this?
043	JOH	011	027	She said to him: Yes, Lord; I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world.
043	JOH	011	028	And when she had said this, she went away, and called Mary, her sister, secretly, saying: The Teacher has come, and calls for you.
043	JOH	011	029	When she heard it, she rose quickly and came to him.
043	JOH	011	030	Now Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was in the place where Martha met him.
043	JOH	011	031	Then the Jews that were with her in the house, and were comforting her, seeing Mary rise and go out quickly, followed her, saying: She is going to the tomb to weep there.
043	JOH	011	032	Then, when Mary came where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell at his feet, saying to him: Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother would not have died.
043	JOH	011	033	Then, when Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews that came with her weeping also, he was greatly moved in spirit, and troubled;
043	JOH	011	034	and he said: Where have you laid him? They said to him: Lord, come and see.
043	JOH	011	035	Jesus wept.
043	JOH	011	036	Then said the Jews: See how he loved him!
043	JOH	011	037	And some of them said: Could not he, who opened the eyes of the blind man, have caused that even this man should not have died?
043	JOH	011	038	Then Jesus, again greatly moved within himself, came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone was laid against it.
043	JOH	011	039	Jesus said: Take away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, said to him: Lord, the body is offensive; for he has been dead four days.
043	JOH	011	040	Jesus said to her: Did I not tell you, that, if you would believe, you should see the glory of God?
043	JOH	011	041	Then they took away the stone. And Jesus lifted up his eyes and said: Father, I thank thee, that thou hast heard me.
043	JOH	011	042	I know, in deed, that thou dost always hear me. But for the sake of the multitude who stand around me, I have said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.
043	JOH	011	043	And when he had said these things, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.
043	JOH	011	044	And he that had been dead came forth, bound hand and foot with grave-clothes; and his face was bound around with a handkerchief. Jesus said to them: Loose him, and let him go.
043	JOH	011	045	Then many of the Jews that had come to Mary, and who saw what he had done, believed on him.
043	JOH	011	046	But some of them went away to the Pharisees, and told them what Jesus had done.
043	JOH	011	047	Then the chief priests and the Pharisees called together the Sanhedrin, and said: What are we doing? For this man does many signs.
043	JOH	011	048	If we thus let him alone, all will believe on him, and the Romans will come and take away our place and our nation.
043	JOH	011	049	But one of them, Caiaphas, who was chief priest that year, said to them: You know nothing,
043	JOH	011	050	nor do you consider that it is profitable for us, that one man should die for the people, and not that the whole nation should perish.
043	JOH	011	051	But this he did not speak of himself; but being chief priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus was about to die for the nation;
043	JOH	011	052	and not for the nation only, but that he should gather into one the children of God that were scattered abroad.
043	JOH	011	053	From that day, therefore, they consulted together to put him to death.
043	JOH	011	054	Therefore, Jesus no longer walked openly among the Jews, but withdrew thence to the region near the wilderness, to a city called Ephraim, and there he remained with his disciples.
043	JOH	011	055	And the passover of the Jews was near; and many went up from the country to Jerusalem, before the passover, to purify themselves.
043	JOH	011	056	Then they sought for Jesus, and said one to another, as they stood in the temple: What think you, that he will not come to the feast?
043	JOH	011	057	Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders, that, if any one knew where he was, he should inform them, that they might take him.
043	JOH	012	001	Then, six days before the passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, who had been dead, whom he had raised from the dead.
043	JOH	012	002	There they made him a supper, and Martha served; but Lazarus was one of those who reclined at table with him.
043	JOH	012	003	Then Mary took a pound of ointment of pure nard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair. And the house was filled with the perfume of the ointment.
043	JOH	012	004	Then said one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, who was about to deliver him up:
043	JOH	012	005	Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred denarii, and given to the poor?
043	JOH	012	006	But he said this, not because he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and had the purse, and took what was put in it.
043	JOH	012	007	Then Jesus said: Let her alone; she has kept this for the day of my burial.
043	JOH	012	008	For the poor you have always with you; but me you have not always.
043	JOH	012	009	Therefore, a great multitude of the Jews learned that he was there; and they came, not on account of Jesus only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.
043	JOH	012	010	But the chief priests consulted that they might kill Lazarus also,
043	JOH	012	011	because on account of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.
043	JOH	012	012	On the next day, a great multitude that had come to the feast, having heard that Jesus was coming into Jerusalem,
043	JOH	012	013	took branches of palm-trees, and went out to meet him, and cried: Hosanna, blessed is the king of Israel that comes in the name of the Lord.
043	JOH	012	014	And Jesus, having found a young ass, sat upon him, as it is written:
043	JOH	012	015	Fear not, daughter of Zion; behold, your king comes, sitting on the colt of an ass.
043	JOH	012	016	His disciples did not understand these things at first; but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things to him.
043	JOH	012	017	The multitude therefore that was with him, testified that he had called Lazarus out of the tomb, and raised him from the dead.
043	JOH	012	018	For this reason, also, the multitude met him, because they had heard that he had done this sign.
043	JOH	012	019	Then the Pharisees said among themselves: You see that you gain nothing. Behold, the world has gone after him.
043	JOH	012	020	Among those who came to worship at the feast were certain Greeks.
043	JOH	012	021	These then came to Philip, who was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying: Sir, we wish to see Jesus.
043	JOH	012	022	Philip came and told Andrew; and then Andrew and Philip told Jesus.
043	JOH	012	023	But Jesus answered them, saying: The hour has come that the Son of man must be glorified.
043	JOH	012	024	Verily, verily I say to you, unless a grain of wheat fall into the ground and die, it remains alone; but if it die, it produces much fruit.
043	JOH	012	025	He that loves his life shall lose it; and he that hates his life in this world shall keep it to eternal life.
043	JOH	012	026	If any one serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall my servant also be. If any one serve me, him will my Father honor.
043	JOH	012	027	Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour? But for this purpose came I to this hour.
043	JOH	012	028	Father, glorify thy name. Then there came a voice from heaven: I have glorified it, and will glorify it again.
043	JOH	012	029	Then the multitude that stood by and heard it, said: It thundered. Others said: An angel spoke to him.
043	JOH	012	030	Jesus answered and said: This voice came not for my sake, but for yours.
043	JOH	012	031	Now is the judgment of this world: now is the prince of this world cast out.
043	JOH	012	032	And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to myself.
043	JOH	012	033	This he said, signifying what death he was about to die.
043	JOH	012	034	The multitude answered him: We have heard out of the law, that the Christ remains forever: and how say you that the Son of man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of man?
043	JOH	012	035	Then Jesus said to them: Yet a little while is the light with you: walk while you have the light, lest the darkness overtake you. For he that walks in the darkness knows not whither he goes.
043	JOH	012	036	While you have the light, believe in the light, that you may become the sons of light. These things spoke Jesus, and he departed, and concealed himself from them.
043	JOH	012	037	But though he had done so many signs in their presence, yet they believed not on him,
043	JOH	012	038	that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke: Lord, who has believed our report? and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?
043	JOH	012	039	For this reason they could not believe, because Isaiah said again:
043	JOH	012	040	He has blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart, lest they should see with their eyes, and understand with their heart, and should turn, and I should give them health.
043	JOH	012	041	These things said Isaiah, when he saw his glory, and spoke of him.
043	JOH	012	042	But yet, many even of the rulers believed on him; but on account of the Pharisees, they would not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue;
043	JOH	012	043	for they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God.
043	JOH	012	044	Jesus cried, and said: He that believes on me, believes not on me, but on him that sent me.
043	JOH	012	045	And he that sees me, sees him that sent me.
043	JOH	012	046	I have come a light into the world, that he who believes on me, may not remain in darkness.
043	JOH	012	047	And if any one hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not; for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.
043	JOH	012	048	He that rejects me, and receives not my words, has that which judges him: the word which I have spoken, that shall judge him in the last day.
043	JOH	012	049	For I have not spoken of myself: but the Father who sent me, he gave me commandment what I should say, and what I should speak.
043	JOH	012	050	And I know that his commandment is life eternal. What things I speak therefore, as the Father has said to me, so I speak.
043	JOH	013	001	Now before the feast of the passover, Jesus knew that his hour had come that he must go out of this world to his Father; and having loved his own that were in the world, he loved them to the end.
043	JOH	013	002	And supper being over, the devil having already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, to deliver him up,
043	JOH	013	003	Jesus, knowing that the Father had delivered all things into his hands, and that he had come from God, and was going to God,
043	JOH	013	004	arose from supper, and laid aside his garments, and taking a towel, he girded himself.
043	JOH	013	005	Then he poured water into a basin, and began to wash his disciples feet, and to wipe them with the towel with which he was girded.
043	JOH	013	006	Then he came to Simon Peter; and Peter said to him: Lord, dost thou wash my feet?
043	JOH	013	007	Jesus answered and said to him: What I am doing you know not now, but you will know hereafter.
043	JOH	013	008	Peter said to him: Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him: Unless I wash you, you have no part with me.
043	JOH	013	009	Simon Peter said to him: Lord, not my feet only, but my hands and my head.
043	JOH	013	010	Jesus said to him: He that has bathed needs nothing else save to wash his feet, but is wholly clean. And you are clean, but not all.
043	JOH	013	011	For he knew who would deliver him up; for this reason he said, You are not all clean.
043	JOH	013	012	Therefore, when he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, he reclined at table again, and said to them: Do you understand what I have done for you?
043	JOH	013	013	You call me Teacher and Lord; and you say well, for so I am.
043	JOH	013	014	If, then, I, your Lord and your Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet.
043	JOH	013	015	For I have given you an example, that you also may do as I have done for you.
043	JOH	013	016	Verily, verily I say to you, the servant is not greater than his master, nor is he that is sent greater than he that sent him.
043	JOH	013	017	If you know these things, blessed are you, if you do them.
043	JOH	013	018	I speak not of you all. I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eats bread with me has lifted up his heel against me.
043	JOH	013	019	I tell you this now, before it comes to pass, that when it comes to pass, you may believe that I am he.
043	JOH	013	020	Verily, verily I say to you, he that receives him that I shall send, receives me; and he that receives me, receives him that sent me.
043	JOH	013	021	When Jesus had spoken these things, he was troubled in spirit, and testified and said: Verily, verily I say to you, that one of you will deliver me up.
043	JOH	013	022	Then the disciples looked at one another, doubting of whom he spoke.
043	JOH	013	023	There was reclining on the bosom of Jesus, one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.
043	JOH	013	024	Then Simon Peter beckoned to this one, that he should inquire who it was of whom he spoke.
043	JOH	013	025	And he that was reclining on Jesus breast, said to him: Lord, who is it?
043	JOH	013	026	Jesus answered: It is he to whom I shall give this morsel after I have dipped it. And when he had dipped the morsel, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.
043	JOH	013	027	And after the morsel was given, then Satan entered into him. Then Jesus said to him: What you do, do quickly.
043	JOH	013	028	But none of those who reclined at table with him knew for what purpose he said this to him.
043	JOH	013	029	For some thought, because Judas had the purse, that Jesus had said to him: Buy what we need for the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor.
043	JOH	013	030	Then, on receiving the morsel, he immediately went out; and it was night.
043	JOH	013	031	When he had gone out, Jesus said: Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.
043	JOH	013	032	If God is glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself, and will immediately glorify him.
043	JOH	013	033	Little children, yet a little while I am with you. You will seek me, and, as I said to the Jews, whither I go, you can not come, so now I say to you.
043	JOH	013	034	A new commandment I give to you, That you love one another; as I have loved you, that you also love one another.
043	JOH	013	035	By this shall all men know that you are my disciples, if you have love one for another.
043	JOH	013	036	Simon Peter said to him: Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered him: Whither I go, you can not follow me now; but you shall follow me hereafter.
043	JOH	013	037	Peter said to him: Lord, why can I not follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thee.
043	JOH	013	038	Jesus answered him: Will you lay down your life for me? Verily, verily I say to you, the cock will not crow till you have denied me three times.
043	JOH	014	001	Let not your heart be troubled; believe in God; believe also in me.
043	JOH	014	002	In my Father’s house are many mansions; if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.
043	JOH	014	003	And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and take you with myself, that where I am, you may be also.
043	JOH	014	004	And whither I go you know, and the way you know.
043	JOH	014	005	Thomas said to him: Lord, we know not whither thou goest, and how can we know the way?
043	JOH	014	006	Jesus said to him: I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father, but through me.
043	JOH	014	007	If you had known me, you would have known my Father also. And from this time you know him, and have seen him.
043	JOH	014	008	Philip said to him: Lord, show us the Father, and we shall be content.
043	JOH	014	009	Jesus said to him: Have I been so long with you, and have you not known me, Philip? He that has seen me, has seen the Father; and how say you, Show us the Father?
043	JOH	014	010	Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and that the Father is in me? The words that I speak to you, I speak not of myself. The Father who dwells in me, he does the works.
043	JOH	014	011	Believe me, that I am in the Father, and that the Father is in me. If not, believe me on account of the works themselves.
043	JOH	014	012	Verily, verily I say to you, he that believes on me, the works that I do he also shall do. Even greater works than these shall he do, because I go to my Father;
043	JOH	014	013	and whatever you ask in my name, I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.
043	JOH	014	014	If you ask any thing in my name, I will do it.
043	JOH	014	015	If you love me, keep my commandments;
043	JOH	014	016	and I will pray the Father, and he will give you another Paraclete, that he may dwell with you forever;
043	JOH	014	017	the Spirit of the truth, whom the world can not receive, because it neither sees him nor knows him. But you know him, because he dwells with you, and shall be in you.
043	JOH	014	018	I will not leave you orphans; I am coming to you.
043	JOH	014	019	Yet a little while, and the world sees me no more; but you shall see me. Because I live, you also shall live.
043	JOH	014	020	In that clay you shall know that I am in my Father, arid you in me, and I in you.
043	JOH	014	021	He that has my commandments and keeps them, he it is that loves me; and he that loves me shall be loved by my Father; and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.
043	JOH	014	022	Judas, not Iscariot, said to him: Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself to us, and not to the world?
043	JOH	014	023	Jesus answered and said to him: If any one loves me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him, and make our abode with him.
043	JOH	014	024	He that loves me not, keeps not my words; and the word which you hear is not mine, but the Father’s who sent me.
043	JOH	014	025	These things have I spoken to you, while I am yet with you.
043	JOH	014	026	But the Paraclete, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all things that I have spoken to you.
043	JOH	014	027	Peace I leave to you; my peace I give to you; not as the world gives, do I give to you. Let not your heart be troubled, and let it not be afraid.
043	JOH	014	028	You have heard that I said to you, I am going away, and am coming again to you. If you loved me, you would rejoice, because I go to the Father; for my Father is greater than I.
043	JOH	014	029	And now I have told you before it comes to pass, that when it does come to pass, you may believe.
043	JOH	014	030	I will not talk much more with you; for the prince of this world is coming, and has nothing in me.
043	JOH	014	031	But this takes place that the world may know that I love the Father, and even as he gave me commandment, so I do. Arise, let us go hence.
043	JOH	015	001	I am the true vine, and my Father is the vine-dresser.
043	JOH	015	002	Every branch in me that bears no fruit, he takes away; and every branch that bears fruit, he prunes, that it may bear more fruit.
043	JOH	015	003	Now are you pure, through the word which I have spoken to you.
043	JOH	015	004	Abide in me, and I will abide in you. As the branch can not bear fruit of itself, unless it abide in the vine, so neither can you, unless you abide in me.
043	JOH	015	005	I am the vine, you are the branches. He that abides in me and I in him, he will bear much fruit; for apart from me you can do nothing.
043	JOH	015	006	If any one abide not in me, he is thrown out as a branch, and withers; and such are gathered, and thrown into the fire, and burned.
043	JOH	015	007	If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, you shall ask what you will, and it shall be done for you.
043	JOH	015	008	In this is my Father glorified, that you bear much fruit; and in this you will be my disciples.
043	JOH	015	009	As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you; abide in my love.
043	JOH	015	010	If you keep my commandments, you shall abide in my love, even as I have kept my Father’s commandments, and abide in his love.
043	JOH	015	011	These things have I spoken to you, that my joy may remain in you, and that your joy may be full.
043	JOH	015	012	This is my commandment: That you love one another, as I have loved you.
043	JOH	015	013	Greater love has no man than this, that one should lay down his life for his friends.
043	JOH	015	014	You are my friends, if you do whatever I command you.
043	JOH	015	015	I no longer call you servants, because the servant knows not what his master does. But I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard from my Father, I have made known to you.
043	JOH	015	016	You have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and appointed you, that you may go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit may remain; that whatever you ask of the Father in my name, he may give you.
043	JOH	015	017	These things I command you, that you may love one another.
043	JOH	015	018	If the world hates you, you know that it hated me before it hated you.
043	JOH	015	019	If you were of the world, the world would love its own. But because you are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.
043	JOH	015	020	Remember the word which I spoke to you, The servant is not greater than his master. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my word, they will keep yours also.
043	JOH	015	021	But all these things they will do to you on my account, because they know not him that sent me.
043	JOH	015	022	If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have had sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.
043	JOH	015	023	He that hates me, hates my Father also.
043	JOH	015	024	If I had not done among them the works that no other man has done, they would have had no sin; but now they have both seen, and hated both me and my Father.
043	JOH	015	025	But this is so, that the word may be fulfilled which is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.
043	JOH	015	026	But when the Paraclete has come, whom I will send to you from my Father, the Spirit of the truth, which proceeds from the Father, he will testify of me;
043	JOH	015	027	and you also will testify, because you have been with me from the beginning.
043	JOH	016	001	These things have I spoken to you, that you may not be ensnared.
043	JOH	016	002	They will put you out of the synagogues; indeed, the time is coming, when he that kills you, will think that he is offering service to God.
043	JOH	016	003	And these things they will do, because they know neither the Father nor me.
043	JOH	016	004	But these things I have told you, that, when the time has come, you may remember that I told you of them. But these things I did not tell you at the beginning, because I was with you.
043	JOH	016	005	And now I go to him that sent me, and no one of you asks me, Whither goest thou?
043	JOH	016	006	But because I have spoken these things to you, sorrow has filled your heart.
043	JOH	016	007	But yet I tell you the truth: it is profitable for you that I go away. For if I go not away, the Paraclete will not come to you. But if I go away, I will send him to you.
043	JOH	016	008	And when he has come, he will convince the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment.
043	JOH	016	009	Of sin, because they believe not on me;
043	JOH	016	010	of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and you see me no more;
043	JOH	016	011	of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged.
043	JOH	016	012	I have yet many things to say to you; but you can not bear them now.
043	JOH	016	013	But when he, the Spirit of the truth, has come, he will guide you into all the truth; for he will not speak of himself; but what he hears, that will he speak, and he will show you things to come.
043	JOH	016	014	He will glorify me; for he will take of mine, and show it to you.
043	JOH	016	015	All things that the Father has are mine; for this reason I said, that he will take of mine, and show it to you.
043	JOH	016	016	A little while, and you will not see me; and again, a little while, and you will see me, because I go to the Father.
043	JOH	016	017	Then some of his disciples said one to another: What is this that he says to us, A little while, and you will not see me; and again, a little while, and you will see me? and, Be cause I go to the Father?
043	JOH	016	018	Therefore they said: What is this that he says, The little while? We know not what he says.
043	JOH	016	019	Then Jesus knew that they wished to ask him; and he said to them: Are you inquiring of one another about this, because I said, A little while and you will not see me; and again, a little while, and you will see me?
043	JOH	016	020	Verily, verily I say to you, you shall weep and lament, but the world will rejoice. You shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.
043	JOH	016	021	A woman, when she is in labor, has sorrow, be cause her hour has come; but when the child is born, she no longer remembers the pain, for joy that a man is born into the world.
043	JOH	016	022	You, therefore, have sorrow now; but I shall see you again, and your heart will rejoice, and your joy no one takes from you.
043	JOH	016	023	And in that day you shall ask nothing of me; verily, verily I say to you, whatever you ask of the Father in my name, he will give you.
043	JOH	016	024	Till this time you have asked for nothing in my name; ask, and you shall receive, that your joy may be full.
043	JOH	016	025	These things I have spoken to you in parables; the time is coming when I will no longer speak to you in parables, but will teach you plainly concerning the Father.
043	JOH	016	026	In that day you shall ask in my name; and I say not to you, that I will ask the Father in your behalf;
043	JOH	016	027	for the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me, and have believed that I came forth from God.
043	JOH	016	028	I came forth from the Father, and have come into the world: again I leave the world, and go to the Father.
043	JOH	016	029	His disciples said to him: Lo, now thou speakest plainly, and speakest no parable.
043	JOH	016	030	Now we know that thou knowest all things, and hast no need that any one should ask thee. By this we believe that thou hast come forth from God.
043	JOH	016	031	Jesus answered them: Do you now believe?
043	JOH	016	032	Behold, the hour is coming, and has now come, in which you shall be scattered, each one to his own home, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, for the Father is with me.
043	JOH	016	033	These things I have spoken to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you shall have affliction, but be of good courage; I have overcome the world.
043	JOH	017	001	Jesus spoke these words, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said: Father, the hour has come: glorify thy Son, that thy Son may also glorify thee;
043	JOH	017	002	as thou hast given him authority over all flesh, that he may give eternal life to all that thou hast given him.
043	JOH	017	003	And this is life eternal, to know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou has sent.
043	JOH	017	004	I have glorified thee on the earth; I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.
043	JOH	017	005	And now, Father, glorify me with thyself, with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.
043	JOH	017	006	I have made known thy name to the men that thou gavest me out of the world. Thine they were, and thou gavest them, to me, and they have kept thy word.
043	JOH	017	007	Now they know that all things that thou hast given me are from thee;
043	JOH	017	008	for the words which thou gavest me I have given them; and they have received them, and they know surely that I came forth from thee, and they believe that thou didst send me.
043	JOH	017	009	I pray for them; I pray not for the world, but for them whom thou hast given me; for they are thine.
043	JOH	017	010	And all mine are thine, and thine are mine, and I am glorified in them.
043	JOH	017	011	And I am no longer in the world; but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep in thy name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are one.
043	JOH	017	012	While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name. Those whom thou gavest me, I have kept; and none of them is lost but the son of perdition, that the scripture may be fulfilled.
043	JOH	017	013	And now I come to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they may have my joy fulfilled in themselves.
043	JOH	017	014	I have given them thy word; and the world has hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.
043	JOH	017	015	I do not pray thee to take them out of the world, but to keep them from the Evil One.
043	JOH	017	016	They are not of the world, as I am not of the world.
043	JOH	017	017	Sanctify them through thy truth; thy word is truth.
043	JOH	017	018	As thou hast sent me into the world, so I send them into the world;
043	JOH	017	019	and for them I sanctify myself, that they also may be sanctified through the truth.
043	JOH	017	020	I pray, not for these only, but for those also who shall believe on me through their word;
043	JOH	017	021	that they all may be one, as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.
043	JOH	017	022	And the glory which thou gavest me, I have given them, that they may be one, as we are one;
043	JOH	017	023	I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one, that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me.
043	JOH	017	024	Father, I wish that they also, whom thou hast given me, may be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me; for thou didst love me before the foundation of the world.
043	JOH	017	025	Righteous Father, though the world has not known thee, yet I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me.
043	JOH	017	026	And I have made known to them thy name, and will continue to make it known, that the love with which thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them.
043	JOH	018	001	When Jesus had spoken these things, he went out with his disciples beyond the brook Kedron, where was a garden, which he and his disciples entered.
043	JOH	018	002	And Judas, who delivered him up, also knew the place, because Jesus often went thither with his disciples.
043	JOH	018	003	Judas, then, having received the band of soldiers and attendants from the chief priests and Pharisees, came thither with torches and lamps and weapons.
043	JOH	018	004	Then Jesus, knowing all things that were coming upon him, went forth, and said to them: Whom do you seek?
043	JOH	018	005	They answered him: Jesus the Nazarene. Jesus said to them: I am he. Judas, also, who delivered him up, was standing among them.
043	JOH	018	006	Then, when he said to them, I am he, they went backward, and fell to the ground.
043	JOH	018	007	Then he asked them again: Whom do you seek? They said: Jesus the Nazarene.
043	JOH	018	008	Jesus answered: I have told you that I am he. If, then, you seek me, let these go away.
043	JOH	018	009	This he said, that the word might be fulfilled which he had spoken: Of those whom thou hast given me; I have lost none.
043	JOH	018	010	Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it, and struck the servant of the chief priest, and cut off his right ear. The name of the servant was Malchus.
043	JOH	018	011	Then Jesus said to Peter: Put up your sword into its scabbard. Shall I not drink the cup that my Father has given me?
043	JOH	018	012	Then the band of soldiers, and the officer, and the attendants of the Jews, took Jesus and bound him,
043	JOH	018	013	and led him first to Annas; for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was chief priest that year.
043	JOH	018	014	It was Caiaphas who had given counsel to the Jews, that it was profitable that one man should die for the people.
043	JOH	018	015	And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple. And that other disciple was acquainted with the chief priest, and he went in with Jesus into the palace of the chief priest.
043	JOH	018	016	But Peter stood without near the door. Then the other disciple, who was acquainted with the chief priest, went out and spoke to the door-keeper, and brought Peter in.
043	JOH	018	017	Then the maid-servant who kept the door said to Peter: Are you not also one of the disciples of this man? He said: I am not.
043	JOH	018	018	And the servants and the attendants, having made a fire of coals, for it was cold, were standing and warming themselves. And Peter stood with them, and warmed himself.
043	JOH	018	019	Then the chief priest questioned Jesus concerning his disciples and his teaching.
043	JOH	018	020	Jesus answered him: I have spoken openly to the world; I always taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, where the Jews come together, and in secret I have spoken nothing.
043	JOH	018	021	Why do you ask me? Ask those who have heard, what things I said to them. Behold, they know what I have said.
043	JOH	018	022	When he had spoken thus, one of the attendants, who was standing by, struck Jesus with his open hand, saying: Do you answer the chief priest thus?
043	JOH	018	023	Jesus answered him: If I have spoken evil, testify of the evil; but if well, why do you strike me?
043	JOH	018	024	Then Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the chief priest.
043	JOH	018	025	And Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. Then they said to him: Are not you also one of his disciples? He denied, and said: I am not.
043	JOH	018	026	One of the servants of the chief priest, who was a kinsman of him whose ear Peter had cut off, said: Did I not see you in the garden with him?
043	JOH	018	027	Then Peter denied again. And immediately the cock crew.
043	JOH	018	028	Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas to the governor’s palace. It was the morning hour. And, in order that they might not be denied, but that they might eat the passover, they did not go into the governor’s palace.
043	JOH	018	029	Then Pilate came out to them, and said: What accusation do you bring against this man?
043	JOH	018	030	They answered and said to him: If this man were not an evil-doer, we would not have delivered him to you.
043	JOH	018	031	Then Pilate said to them: Take him yourselves, and judge him according to your law. Then the Jews said to him: It is not lawful for us to put any one to death;
043	JOH	018	032	that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spoke, signifying by what death he was about to die.
043	JOH	018	033	Then Pilate again entered the governor’s palace, and called Jesus, and said to him: Are you the king of the Jews?
043	JOH	018	034	Jesus answered him: Do you say this of yourself, or did others speak to you of me?
043	JOH	018	035	Pilate answered: Am I a Jew? Your own nation, and the chief priests have delivered you to me; what have you done?
043	JOH	018	036	Jesus answered: My kingdom is not of this world; if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I might not be delivered up to the Jews. But now my kingdom is not hence.
043	JOH	018	037	Then Pilate said to him: You are a king, then? Jesus answered; You say that I am a king. For this purpose was I born, and for this purpose I came into the world, that I might testify to the truth. Every one that is of the truth, hears my voice.
043	JOH	018	038	Pilate said to him: What is truth? And when he had said this, he again came out to the Jews, and said to them: I find no fault in him.
043	JOH	018	039	But you have a custom, that I release to you one during the passover. Are you willing, then, that I should release to you the king of the Jews?
043	JOH	018	040	They all, then, cried out, saying: Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.
043	JOH	019	001	Then Pilate, therefore, took Jesus and scourged him.
043	JOH	019	002	And the soldiers plaited a crown of thorn-branches, and put it upon his head; and they put on him a purple robe,
043	JOH	019	003	and said: Hail, King of the Jews. And they struck him with their open hands.
043	JOH	019	004	Then Pilate came out again, and said to them: Behold, I bring him out to you, that you may know that I find no fault in him.
043	JOH	019	005	Then Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorn-branches, and the purple robe. And Pilate said to them: Be hold the man!
043	JOH	019	006	When the chief priests and their attendants saw him, they cried out, saying: Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate said to them: Do you take him and crucify him; for I find no fault in him.
043	JOH	019	007	The Jews answered: We have a law, and according to our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.
043	JOH	019	008	Then, when Pilate heard this word, he was the more afraid;
043	JOH	019	009	and he went into the governor’s palace again, and said to Jesus: Whence are you? But Jesus gave him no answer.
043	JOH	019	010	Then Pilate said to him: Do you not speak to me? Do you not know that I have authority to crucify you, and authority to release you?
043	JOH	019	011	Jesus answered: You could have no authority over me, had it not been given you from above. Therefore, he that delivered me to you, has the greater sin.
043	JOH	019	012	After this Pilate sought to release him. But the Jews cried out, saying: If you release this man, you are not Cæsar’s friend. Every one that makes himself a king, speaks against Cæsar
043	JOH	019	013	Then Pilate, when he heard that word, led Jesus out, and sat on the judgment-seat, in a place called the Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha;
043	JOH	019	014	it was the preparation for the passover, and about the third hour; and he said to the Jews, Behold your king!
043	JOH	019	015	But they cried out: Away with him, away with him; crucify him! Pilate said to them: Shall I crucify your king? The chief priests answered: We have no king but Cæsar
043	JOH	019	016	Then he, therefore, delivered him to them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led him away.
043	JOH	019	017	And, bearing his cross, he went forth into a place called the Place of a Skull, which is called, in Hebrew, Golgotha,
043	JOH	019	018	where they crucified him, and with him two others, one on each side, and Jesus in the middle.
043	JOH	019	019	And Pilate wrote a superscription, and put it on the cross; and the writing was, JESUS THE NAZARENE, THE KING OF THE JEWS.
043	JOH	019	020	Therefore many of the Jews read this superscription, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city. And it was written in Hebrew and in Greek and in Latin.
043	JOH	019	021	Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate: Write not, The king of the Jews; but, that he said, I am the king of the Jews.
043	JOH	019	022	Pilate answered: What I have written, I have written.
043	JOH	019	023	Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his clothing, and made four parts, to each soldier a part; and they took his coat also. Now his coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.
043	JOH	019	024	Then they said, one to another, let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be. This was done that the scripture might be fulfilled, which says: They divided my clothing among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots. The soldiers, therefore, did these things.
043	JOH	019	025	Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Cleopas, and Mary Magdalene.
043	JOH	019	026	Then Jesus, seeing his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing by, said to his mother: Woman, behold your son.
043	JOH	019	027	Then he said to the disciple: Behold your mother. And from that hour that disciple took her to his own home.
043	JOH	019	028	After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, said: I thirst.
043	JOH	019	029	Now a vessel full of vinegar had been set there; and they filled a sponge with vinegar, and put it upon a hyssop-stalk, and put it to his mouth.
043	JOH	019	030	Therefore, when Jesus had received the vinegar, he said: It is finished. And he bowed his head, and gave up his spirit.
043	JOH	019	031	Then the Jews, as it was the preparation, that the bodies might not remain on the cross on the sabbath, for that sabbath-day was a great day, besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken down.
043	JOH	019	032	Then came the soldiers and broke the legs of the first, and of the other that was crucified with him.
043	JOH	019	033	But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs:
043	JOH	019	034	but one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear; and immediately there came out blood and water.
043	JOH	019	035	And he that saw it has given testimony, and his testimony is true, and he knows that he speaks the truth, that you may believe;
043	JOH	019	036	for these things were done that the scripture might be fulfilled: A bone of him shall not be broken.
043	JOH	019	037	And again another scripture says: They shall look on him whom they pierced.
043	JOH	019	038	And after this, Joseph of Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly, for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus. And Pilate gave him permission. He then came and took away the body of Jesus.
043	JOH	019	039	Then came Nicodemus also, (who, at the first, had come to Jesus by night, ) bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds.
043	JOH	019	040	Then they took the body of Jesus, and bound it in linen cloths, with the spices, according to the Jewish custom of burying.
043	JOH	019	041	Now, in the place where he was crucified, there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one had ever been laid.
043	JOH	019	042	There, then, on account of the preparation-day of the Jews, they laid Jesus, for the tomb was near.
043	JOH	020	001	And early on the first day of the week, while it was yet dark, Mary Magdalene came to the tomb, and saw that the stone had been taken away from the tomb.
043	JOH	020	002	Then she ran and came to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and said to them: They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we know not where they have laid him.
043	JOH	020	003	Then Peter and the other disciple went out, and came to the tomb.
043	JOH	020	004	And the two ran together; and the other disciple outran Peter, and came first to the tomb;
043	JOH	020	005	and he stooped down and saw the linen cloths lying, but he did not go in.
043	JOH	020	006	Then came Simon Peter, following him; and he went into the tomb, and saw the linen cloths lying,
043	JOH	020	007	and the handkerchief that had been on his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but folded in a place by itself.
043	JOH	020	008	Then, therefore, the other disciple, who came first to the tomb, went in, and saw, and believed.
043	JOH	020	009	For, as yet, they did not know the scripture, that he must rise from the dead.
043	JOH	020	010	Then the disciples went away again by themselves.
043	JOH	020	011	But Mary stood without near the tomb, weeping; and as she wept, she stooped down and looked into the tomb,
043	JOH	020	012	and saw two angels in white raiment, sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the foot, where the body of Jesus had lain.
043	JOH	020	013	And they said to her: Woman, why do you weep? She said to them: They have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.
043	JOH	020	014	Having said this, she turned back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.
043	JOH	020	015	Jesus said to her: Woman, why do you weep? Whom do you seek? Supposing that it was the gardener, she said to him: Sir, if you have taken him hence, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.
043	JOH	020	016	Jesus said to her: Mary. She turned, and said to him: Rabboni; which is, translated, Teacher.
043	JOH	020	017	Jesus said to her: Touch me not, for I have not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say to them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God.
043	JOH	020	018	Mary Magdalen came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that he had said these things to her.
043	JOH	020	019	Then, on that day, the first day of the week, when it was evening, and the doors of the house in which the disciples were assembled had been closed for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and said to them: Peace be to you.
043	JOH	020	020	And having said this, he showed them his hands and his side. Then the disciples rejoiced, when they saw the Lord.
043	JOH	020	021	Then Jesus said to them again: Peace be to you. As my Father has sent me, so I send you.
043	JOH	020	022	And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and said to them: Receive the Holy Spirit.
043	JOH	020	023	Whosever sins you forgive, they are forgiven them: whosever sins you retain, they are retained.
043	JOH	020	024	But Thomas, one of the twelve, who is called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.
043	JOH	020	025	Then the other disciples said to him: We have seen the Lord. But he said to them: Unless I see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger in the print of the nails, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.
043	JOH	020	026	And after eight days, again his disciples were within, and Thomas was with them. Then Jesus came, though the doors had been closed, and stood in the midst, and said: Peace be to you.
043	JOH	020	027	Then he said to Thomas: Reach hither your finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither your hand, and put it into my side; and be not faithless, but believing.
043	JOH	020	028	And Thomas answered and said to him: My Lord and my God.
043	JOH	020	029	Jesus said to him: Because you have seen me you have believed: blessed are they who, though they have not seen, yet have believed.
043	JOH	020	030	Many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book;
043	JOH	020	031	but these are written, that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life through his name.
043	JOH	021	001	After this, Jesus showed himself again to his disciples, at the sea of Tiberias. And he showed himself in this way.
043	JOH	021	002	There were together, Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathaniel of Cana of Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples.
043	JOH	021	003	Simon Peter said to them: I am going a fishing. They said to him: We also are going with you. They went out and entered the ship; and that night they caught nothing.
043	JOH	021	004	But when the morning had now come, Jesus stood on the shore; but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.
043	JOH	021	005	Then Jesus said to them: Children, have you any food? They answered him: No.
043	JOH	021	006	He said to them: Throw the net on the right side of the ship, and you will find. They threw it, there fore, and were no longer able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.
043	JOH	021	007	Then that disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter: It is the Lord. And when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girded on his outer coat, for he had on his inner garment only, and threw himself into the sea.
043	JOH	021	008	And the other disciples came in a little ship, dragging the net with fishes, for they were not far from the land, only about two hundred cubits.
043	JOH	021	009	As soon as they had come to the land, they saw there a fire of coals, and fish lying upon it, and bread.
043	JOH	021	010	Jesus said to them; Bring of the fish that you have just taken.
043	JOH	021	011	Simon Peter went and drew the net to the land, full of large fishes, a hundred and fifty-three. And though they were so many, the net did not break.
043	JOH	021	012	Jesus said to them: Come and breakfast. But no one of the disciples durst ask him, Who art thou? because they knew it was the Lord.
043	JOH	021	013	Then Jesus came and took the bread, and gave it to them, and the fish likewise.
043	JOH	021	014	This was now the third occasion on which Jesus showed himself to his disciples, after he had risen from the dead.
043	JOH	021	015	When, therefore, they had taken breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter: Simon, son of Jonah, Do you love me more than these? He said to him: Yes, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee. He said to him: Feed my lambs.
043	JOH	021	016	He said to him again a second time: Simon, son of Jonah, do you love me? He said to him: Yes, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee. He said to him: Be a shepherd to my sheep.
043	JOH	021	017	He said to him a third time: Simon, son of Jonah, do you love me? Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, Do you love me? And he said to him: Lord, thou knowest all things, thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus said to him: Feed my sheep.
043	JOH	021	018	Verily, verily I say to you, when you were young, you girded yourself, and walked whither you chose; but when you have become old, you shall stretch forth your hands, and another shall gird you, and lead you whither you would not.
043	JOH	021	019	But this he said, signifying by what death he would glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he said to him: Follow me.
043	JOH	021	020	Then Peter, turning about, saw the disciple that Jesus loved, following, who also reclined at supper upon his breast, and said: Lord, who is he that delivers thee up?
043	JOH	021	021	Peter seeing this one, said to Jesus: Lord, what shall this one do?
043	JOH	021	022	Jesus said to him: If I will that he remain till I come, what is that to you? Do you follow me.
043	JOH	021	023	Therefore, this saying went out among the brethren, that that disciple should not die. Yet Jesus did not say to him, He shall not die; but, If I will that he remain till I come, what is that to you?
043	JOH	021	024	This is the disciple who testifies of these things, and who has written these things; and we know that his testimony is true.
043	JOH	021	025	And there are also many other things that Jesus did; if they should be written, every one of them, I suppose that not even the world itself could contain the books that would be written.

# BOOK	044	ACT	Acts	Acts
044	ACT	001	001	The former record I made, O Theophilus, of all things that Jesus began both to do and to teach,
044	ACT	001	002	till the day on which he was taken up, after he had, through the Holy Spirit, given commandments to the apostles whom he had chosen.
044	ACT	001	003	To whom, after he had suffered, he also showed himself alive, by many indubitable proofs; appearing to them for forty days, and speaking of the things that pertain to the kingdom of God.
044	ACT	001	004	And calling them together, he commanded them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of my Father, which, said he, you have heard from me;
044	ACT	001	005	for John indeed immersed in water, but you shall be immersed in the Holy Spirit, not many days hence.
044	ACT	001	006	Therefore, when they came together, they asked him, saying: Lord, wilt thou at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?
044	ACT	001	007	But he said to them: It is not for you to know times or seasons that the Father has reserved under his own control.
044	ACT	001	008	But you shall receive power, after the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you shall be witnesses for me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and to the most distant part of the earth.
044	ACT	001	009	And when he had spoken these things, while they were looking on him, he was taken up, and a cloud received him out of their sight.
044	ACT	001	010	And while they were looking earnestly toward heaven, as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white raiment,
044	ACT	001	011	who also said: Men of Galilee, why stand you gazing up into heaven? This Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven, shall come in the same manner in which you saw him go into heaven.
044	ACT	001	012	Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a sabbath-day’s journey.
044	ACT	001	013	And when they had come in, they went up into an upper room, in which dwelt Peter and James, and John and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphæus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James.
044	ACT	001	014	All these, with one mind, continued in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.
044	ACT	001	015	And in those days Peter arose in the midst of the disciples, (the number of the names together was about a hundred and twenty, ) and said:
044	ACT	001	016	Brethren, it was necessary for this scripture to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit had before spoken by the mouth of David, concerning Judas, who was a guide to those who took Jesus:
044	ACT	001	017	for he was numbered with us, and had been appointed to this ministry.
044	ACT	001	018	Therefore he purchased a field with the reward of his iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out.
044	ACT	001	019	And it was known to all that dwelt in Jerusalem, so that the field is called, in their own language, Akeldama, that is, The field of blood.
044	ACT	001	020	For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no one dwell in it, and, His office let another take.
044	ACT	001	021	Therefore, of these men who have associated with us during the whole time in which the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,
044	ACT	001	022	beginning from the immersion of John till the day on which he was taken up from us, must one be appointed as a witness with us of his resurrection.
044	ACT	001	023	And they set apart two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias;
044	ACT	001	024	and praying, they said: Thou, Lord, who knowest the hearts of all, make known which of these two thou hast chosen,
044	ACT	001	025	that he may be appointed to this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own place.
044	ACT	001	026	And they gave in their lots, and the lot fell on Matthias: and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.
044	ACT	002	001	And when the day of Pentecost had fully come, they were all with one consent in one place.
044	ACT	002	002	And suddenly there came from heaven a sound as of a rushing, violent wind, and it filled the whole house in which they were sitting.
044	ACT	002	003	And there appeared to them tongues like fire, which distributed themselves, and sat one on each of them.
044	ACT	002	004	And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.
044	ACT	002	005	Now there were dwelling in Jerusalem devout Jews, from every nation under heaven.
044	ACT	002	006	When the report of this had gone abroad, the multitude came together; and they were perplexed, for each one heard them speak in his own language.
044	ACT	002	007	They were amazed and astonished, and said one to another: Are not all these that are speaking, Galileans?
044	ACT	002	008	And how is it that we hear, every one in our own language in which we were born―
044	ACT	002	009	Parthians and Modes and Elamites, and we who dwell in Mesopotamia, Judea, and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,
044	ACT	002	010	Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya about Cyrene, Roman residents, Jews and proselytes,
044	ACT	002	011	Cretes and Arabians―we hear them speaking, in our own tongues, the wonderful works of God?
044	ACT	002	012	And they were all in amazement and doubt, and said, one to another: What can this mean?
044	ACT	002	013	But others deriding, said: They are full of new wine.
044	ACT	002	014	But Peter standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice and said to them: Men of Judea, and all you that dwell in Jerusalem, be this known to you, and give ear to my words.
044	ACT	002	015	For these men are not drunk, as you suppose: for it is the third hour of the day.
044	ACT	002	016	But this is that which was spoken of by the prophet Joel:
044	ACT	002	017	And it shall come to pass in the last days, says God, that I will pour out of my Spirit on all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams.
044	ACT	002	018	And also on my servants and on my handmaids, I will pour out of my Spirit in those days, and they shall prophesy.
044	ACT	002	019	And I will show wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath, blood and fire and columns of smoke.
044	ACT	002	020	The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before that great and terrible day of the Lord comes.
044	ACT	002	021	And it shall come to pass, that whoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.
044	ACT	002	022	Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus the Nazarene, clearly pointed out to you as a man from God, by mighty deeds and wonders and signs, which God did by him in your midst, as you yourselves also know,
044	ACT	002	023	him, delivered up by the fixed purpose and foreknowledge of God, you took, and with wicked hands did crucify and slay:
044	ACT	002	024	whom God raised up, having loosed the pains of death, because it was not possible for him to be held in subjection by it.
044	ACT	002	025	For David speaks with reference to him: I saw the Lord always in my presence: for he is at my right hand, that I should not be moved.
044	ACT	002	026	Therefore my heart rejoiced, and my tongue sang praise. Moreover, my flesh shall rest in hope;
044	ACT	002	027	because thou wilt not leave my soul in hades, nor suffer thy Holy One to see corruption.
044	ACT	002	028	Thou didst make known to me the ways of life; thou wilt make me full of joy with thy countenance.
044	ACT	002	029	Brethren, I may say to you plainly of the patriarch David, that he died, and was buried, and his sepulcher is with us to this day.
044	ACT	002	030	Therefore, being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn to him with an oath, that he would cause one from the fruit of his loins to sit on his throne;
044	ACT	002	031	foreseeing this, he spoke of the resurrection of the Christ, that his soul was not left in hades, nor did his flesh see corruption.
044	ACT	002	032	This Jesus has God raised up, of which we all are witnesses.
044	ACT	002	033	Therefore, having been exalted to the right hand of God, and having received from his Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this, which you now see and hear.
044	ACT	002	034	For David has not ascended into the heavens; but he himself says, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand,
044	ACT	002	035	till I make thy enemies thy footstool.
044	ACT	002	036	Therefore, let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God has made this same Jesus whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ.
044	ACT	002	037	When they heard this, they were pierced to the heart, and said to Peter and the other apostles: Brethren, what shall we do?
044	ACT	002	038	And Peter said to them: Repent, and be immersed, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, in order to the remission of sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
044	ACT	002	039	For the promise is to you, and your children, and to all that are afar off, as many as the Lord our God shall call.
044	ACT	002	040	And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying: Save yourselves from this wicked generation.
044	ACT	002	041	Then they that gladly received his word were immersed, and on that day there were added to them about three thousand souls.
044	ACT	002	042	And they attended constantly to the teaching of the apostles, and the fellowship, and the breaking of bread, and the prayers.
044	ACT	002	043	And fear came on every soul; and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles.
044	ACT	002	044	And all that believed were together, and had all things in common;
044	ACT	002	045	and they sold their possessions and goods, and distributed them to all, as each had need.
044	ACT	002	046	And with one consent, they continued daily in the temple; and, breaking bread from house to house, they partook of their food with gladness and simplicity of heart,
044	ACT	002	047	praising God, and being in favor with all the people. And the Lord added the saved daily to the Church.
044	ACT	003	001	Now Peter and John were going up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, which was the ninth hour.
044	ACT	003	002	And a certain man, lame from his mother’s womb, was carried along, whom they laid daily at that gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, that he might ask charity of those who were going into the temple.
044	ACT	003	003	This man, seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, asked charity.
044	ACT	003	004	But Peter, fixing his eyes on him with John, said: Look on us.
044	ACT	003	005	And he gave heed to them, expecting to receive something from them.
044	ACT	003	006	But Peter said: Silver and gold I have none: but what I have, this I give you. In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, arise and walk.
044	ACT	003	007	And he took him by his right hand and raised him up: and immediately his feet and ankles received strength.
044	ACT	003	008	And leaping up, he stood and walked, and went with them into the temple, walking and leaping and praising God.
044	ACT	003	009	And all the people saw him walking and praising God;
044	ACT	003	010	and they recognized him, that it was he that had sat for charity at the Beautiful gate of the temple. And they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him.
044	ACT	003	011	And while he was holding to Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the porch called Solomon’s, greatly astonished.
044	ACT	003	012	But when Peter saw it, he answered the people: Men of Israel, why are you astonished at this? or, why do you look so earnestly on us, as if by our own power or godliness we had caused this man to walk?
044	ACT	003	013	The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his Son Jesus, whom you delivered up, and whom you rejected in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to release him.
044	ACT	003	014	But you rejected the Holy and Just One, and demanded that a murderer should be given to you;
044	ACT	003	015	and you slew the Author of life, whom God has raised from the dead, of which we are witnesses.
044	ACT	003	016	And his name, by faith in his name, has made this man strong whom you see and know; even the faith which is by him, has given him this entire soundness in the presence of you all.
044	ACT	003	017	And now, brethren, I know that through ignorance you did this, as did also your rulers.
044	ACT	003	018	But the things which God foretold by the mouth of all his prophets, that the Christ should suffer, he has thus fulfilled.
044	ACT	003	019	Repent, therefore, and turn, in order that your sins may be blotted out, so that seasons of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord,
044	ACT	003	020	and that he may send Jesus Christ, who was destined for you;
044	ACT	003	021	whom heaven must retain, till the time for restoring all things that God has spoken by the mouth of his holy prophets of ancient times.
044	ACT	003	022	For Moses said to the fathers, A prophet like me shall the Lord your God raise up for you from among your brethren; him shall you hear in all things that he shall say to you.
044	ACT	003	023	And it shall come to pass, that every soul that will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people.
044	ACT	003	024	And all the prophets, from Samuel and those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have also foretold these days.
044	ACT	003	025	You are the sons of the prophets, and of the covenant that God made with our fathers, saying to Abraham, And in your offspring shall all the families of the earth be blessed.
044	ACT	003	026	To you first, God, having raised up his Son Jesus, has sent him to bless you, in turning every one of you away from his iniquities.
044	ACT	004	001	While they were speaking to the people, the priests, and the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees came upon them,
044	ACT	004	002	being vexed because they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead.
044	ACT	004	003	And they laid hands on them, and put them in prison till the next day, for it was already evening.
044	ACT	004	004	But many of those who heard the word, believed: and the number of the men was about five thousand.
044	ACT	004	005	And it came to pass, on the next day, that their rulers and elders and scribes,
044	ACT	004	006	and Annas the chief priest, and Caiaphas and John and Alexander, and as many as were of the family of the chief priest, met together in Jerusalem.
044	ACT	004	007	And when they had made them stand in the midst, they asked: By what power, or by what name have you done this?
044	ACT	004	008	Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them: Rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,
044	ACT	004	009	if we are this day examined with respect unto the good deed done to the infirm man, by what means he has been saved,
044	ACT	004	010	be it known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead, by him does this man stand before you in health.
044	ACT	004	011	This is the stone that was rejected with contempt by you builders, which has become the head of the corner.
044	ACT	004	012	And there is salvation in no other; nor, indeed, is there another name under heaven, given among men, by which we must be saved.
044	ACT	004	013	Now, when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and plain men, they were astonished; and they also recognized them, that they had been with Jesus;
044	ACT	004	014	and, seeing the man who had been cured standing with them, they had nothing to say in reply.
044	ACT	004	015	But, having commanded them to go aside out of the Sanhedrim, they consulted with one another,
044	ACT	004	016	saying: What shall we do with these men? For that an evident sign has been done by them, is manifest to all that dwell in Jerusalem, and we can not deny it.
044	ACT	004	017	But that it may spread no further among the people, let us severely threaten them, so that they speak no more to any man in this name.
044	ACT	004	018	And they called them in, and commanded them to speak no more at all, nor to teach, in the name of Jesus.
044	ACT	004	019	But Peter and John answering them, said: Whether it is right in the sight of God to obey you rather than God, judge you.
044	ACT	004	020	For we can not but speak the things that we have seen and heard.
044	ACT	004	021	And when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding nothing for which they could punish them, because of the people; for they all glorified God on account of that which had been done;
044	ACT	004	022	for the man on whom this sign of healing had been performed was more than forty years old.
044	ACT	004	023	And having been released, they went to their own, and told all that the chief priests and elders had said to them.
044	ACT	004	024	And when they heard it, they lifted up their voice with one consent to God, and said: Lord, thou art God, who didst make the heaven and the earth and the sea, and all things that are in them; who, by the mouth of David thy servant, didst say,
044	ACT	004	025	Why did the heathen rage, and the people devise vain things?
044	ACT	004	026	The kings of the land stood up, and the rulers met together against the Lord and against his anointed.
044	ACT	004	027	For, in truth, against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou didst anoint, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of Israel, did meet together,
044	ACT	004	028	to do whatever thy hand and thy counsel determined to be done.
044	ACT	004	029	And now, Lord, look upon their threatenings, and grant to thy servants that they may speak thy word with all boldness,
044	ACT	004	030	by stretching out thy hand to heal, that both signs and wonders may be done through the name of thy holy child Jesus.
044	ACT	004	031	And when they had prayed, the place in which they were assembled was shaken; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and spoke the word of God with boldness.
044	ACT	004	032	And the multitude of believers were of one heart and of one soul; and no one said that any part of his possessions was his own; but they had all things in common.
044	ACT	004	033	And with great power did the apostles bear testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was on them all.
044	ACT	004	034	Nor, indeed, was there any needy person among them; for as many as were owners of lands or houses, sold them, and brought the prices of what had been sold,
044	ACT	004	035	and laid them down at the feet of the apostles; and distribution was made to every one as he had need.
044	ACT	004	036	And Joses, who, by the apostles, was surnamed Barnabas, (which name, when translated, is, Son of consolation, ) a Levite, by birth a Cyprian,
044	ACT	004	037	having land, sold it, and brought the money and laid it at the feet of the apostles.
044	ACT	005	001	But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession,
044	ACT	005	002	and kept back part of the price, and his wife was conscious of it; and he brought a certain part of it, and laid it at the feet of the apostles.
044	ACT	005	003	But Peter said: Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart, that you should attempt to deceive the Holy Spirit, and keep back part of the price of the land?
044	ACT	005	004	While it remained unsold, was it not your own? And after it was sold, was it not at your own disposal? Why have you purposed this thing in your heart? You have not lied to men, but to God.
044	ACT	005	005	And when Ananias heard these words, he fell down, and expired. And great fear came on all that heard these things.
044	ACT	005	006	And the young men arose and wound him in his mantle, and carried him out, and buried him.
044	ACT	005	007	And after an interval of about three hours, his wife, not knowing what had been done, came in.
044	ACT	005	008	And Peter answered her: Tell me, did you sell the land for so much? She replied: Yes; for so much.
044	ACT	005	009	But Peter said to her: Why is it that you have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? Behold, the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they shall carry you out.
044	ACT	005	010	And she immediately fell down at his feet, and expired. And the young men came in and found her dead; and they carried her out, and buried her by the side of her husband.
044	ACT	005	011	And great fear came on all the church, and on all that heard these things.
044	ACT	005	012	And many signs and wonders were done among the people by the hands of the apostles; (and they were all with one consent in Solomon’s porch.
044	ACT	005	013	And no one of the rest durst join himself to them; but the people magnified them.
044	ACT	005	014	And believers in the Lord were more and more added to them, multitudes both of men and women; )
044	ACT	005	015	so that they brought the sick out along the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that even the shadow of Peter, as he passed along, might fall on some of them.
044	ACT	005	016	And many people of the cities round about came to Jerusalem, bringing the sick, and those who were troubled by evil spirits, all of whom were cured.
044	ACT	005	017	But the chief priest arose, and all that were with him, (which is the sect of the Sadducees, ) and were filled with indignation;
044	ACT	005	018	and they laid their hands on the apostles, and put them in the public prison.
044	ACT	005	019	But an angel of the Lord opened the doors of the prison by night, and brought them out, and said:
044	ACT	005	020	Go, stand in the temple, and speak to the people all the words of this life.
044	ACT	005	021	And having heard this, they entered the temple, early in the morning, and taught. But the chief priest, and those who were with him, came and called together the Sanhedrim, and all the eldership of the sons of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought.
044	ACT	005	022	But when the attendants came, and found them not in the prison, they returned and reported,
044	ACT	005	023	saying: We found the prison closed with all safety, and the guards standing before the doors; but when we had opened, we found no one within.
044	ACT	005	024	When the priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these words, they were in doubt about them, what this could mean.
044	ACT	005	025	And some one came and reported to them: Behold, the men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple, and teaching the people.
044	ACT	005	026	Then went the captain with the attendants, and brought them without violence; for they feared the people, lest they should be stoned.
044	ACT	005	027	And when they had brought them, they made them stand before the Sanhedrim; and the chief priest asked them,
044	ACT	005	028	saying: Did we not strictly charge you not to teach in this name? And behold, you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and you intend to bring this man’s blood upon us.
044	ACT	005	029	But Peter and the apostles answered and said: We must obey God rather than men.
044	ACT	005	030	The God of our fathers has raised up Jesus, whom you slew by hanging him on a tree.
044	ACT	005	031	Him has God exalted to his right hand to be a Prince and a Savior, in order to give to Israel repentance and remission of sins:
044	ACT	005	032	and we are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit also, whom God has given to them that obey him.
044	ACT	005	033	And when they heard this, they were enraged; and they determined to put them to death.
044	ACT	005	034	Then arose a certain man in the Sanhedrim, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law, who was honored by all the people; and he commanded them to put the apostles out for a little while,
044	ACT	005	035	and said to them: Men of Israel, consider well with yourselves what you are about to do to these men.
044	ACT	005	036	For before these days Theudas arose, declaring himself to be some great one; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves; and he was slain; and all, as many as believed him, were scattered and brought to naught.
044	ACT	005	037	After this man, Judas the Galilean arose, in the days of the enrollment, and drew over many people after him; and he was destroyed, and all, as many as believed him, were scattered.
044	ACT	005	038	And now I say to you, keep away from these men, and let them alone; for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to an end;
044	ACT	005	039	but if it is of God, you can not bring it to an end: and take heed, lest you be found fighting also against God.
044	ACT	005	040	And they were persuaded by him; and when they had called the apostles in and scourged them, they commanded them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.
044	ACT	005	041	Then, they went from the presence of the Sanhedrim, rejoicing that they were thought worthy to suffer shame for his name’s sake.
044	ACT	005	042	And daily in the temple, and from house to house, they ceased not to teach and to preach Jesus the Christ.
044	ACT	006	001	In those days, when the disciples were increasing in number, there arose a murmuring of the Hellenists against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.
044	ACT	006	002	And the twelve called the multitude of the disciples to them, and said: It is not right that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables.
044	ACT	006	003	Therefore, brethren, select from among yourselves seven men, of good report, full of the Holy Spirit and of wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business:
044	ACT	006	004	but we will give ourselves continually to prayer and to the ministry of the word.
044	ACT	006	005	And the speech pleased the whole multitude; and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip and Prochorus and Nicanor and Timon and Parmenas, and Nicolas, a proselyte of Antioch,
044	ACT	006	006	whom they set before the apostles. And when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.
044	ACT	006	007	And the word of God increased, and the number of the disciples in Jerusalem was greatly multiplied; and a great multitude of the priests became obedient to the faith.
044	ACT	006	008	And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and signs among the people.
044	ACT	006	009	Then there arose some who belonged to the synagogue called the synagogue of the Freedmen, and some of the Cyrenians and Alexandrians, and of those who were from Cilicia and Asia, and they disputed with Stephen.
044	ACT	006	010	And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit with which he spoke.
044	ACT	006	011	Then they instigated men to say: We have heard him speak impious words against Moses, and against God.
044	ACT	006	012	And they excited the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came upon him, and took him by violence, and brought him into the Sanhedrim.
044	ACT	006	013	And they brought forward false witnesses, who said: This man ceases not to speak words against this holy place, and the law.
044	ACT	006	014	For we have heard him say, that this Jesus the Nazarene will destroy this place, and will change the customs which Moses delivered to us.
044	ACT	006	015	And all that sat in the Sanhedrim, looking earnestly upon him, saw his face that it was like the face of an angel.
044	ACT	007	001	And the chief priest said: Are these things so?
044	ACT	007	002	He replied: Brethren and fathers, hear: The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham, while he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charran,
044	ACT	007	003	and said to him: Get out from your land, and from your kindred, and come into a land that I will show you.
044	ACT	007	004	Then he departed from the land of the Chaldeans, and dwelt in Charran; and thence, after his father died, he removed into this land, in which you now dwell.
044	ACT	007	005	And he gave him no inheritance in it, not a foot breadth: and yet he promised to give it for a possession to him, and to his posterity after him, when as yet he had no child.
044	ACT	007	006	And God spoke thus: That his posterity should sojourn in a strange land, and they should enslave them and afflict them, for four hundred years.
044	ACT	007	007	And the nation to which they shall be in bondage I will judge, said God; and after that, they shall come forth and serve me in this place.
044	ACT	007	008	And he gave him the covenant of circumcision, and thus he begot Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac begot Jacob, and Jacob begot the twelve patriarchs.
044	ACT	007	009	And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt: but God was with him,
044	ACT	007	010	and delivered him from all his afflictions, and gave him favor and wisdom in the sight of Pharoah, king of Egypt: and he made him governor over Egypt, and his whole house.
044	ACT	007	011	And there came a famine, and great affliction on the whole land of Egypt, and of Chanaan: and our fathers found no sustenance.
044	ACT	007	012	But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent forth our fathers the first time:
044	ACT	007	013	and, on their second visit, Joseph made himself known to his brothers, and the kindred of Joseph were made known to Pharaoh.
044	ACT	007	014	And Joseph sent and called to him his father Jacob, and all his kindred, seventy-five souls.
044	ACT	007	015	And Jacob went down into Egypt, and died, himself and our fathers;
044	ACT	007	016	and they were carried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulcher which Abraham bought for its value in silver, from the sons of Emmor, the father of Sychem.
044	ACT	007	017	And as the time of the promise which God had made with an oath to Abraham drew near, the people increased and multiplied in Egypt,
044	ACT	007	018	till another king arose, who knew not Joseph.
044	ACT	007	019	He dealt insidiously with our race, and afflicted our fathers, so that they exposed their infants, in order that they might not live.
044	ACT	007	020	At which time Moses was born; and he was exceedingly beautiful, and was nursed three months in his father’s house.
044	ACT	007	021	But having been exposed, the daughter of Pharaoh took him up, and educated him as her own son.
044	ACT	007	022	And Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds.
044	ACT	007	023	When he had completed his fortieth year, it came into his heart to visit his brethren, the sons of Israel.
044	ACT	007	024	And seeing one of them unjustly treated, he defended and avenged him that was oppressed, and smote the Egyptian.
044	ACT	007	025	And he supposed that his brethren would understand that, by his hand, God would give them salvation: but they understood not.
044	ACT	007	026	And on the next day he showed himself to them, as they were fighting, and endeavored to persuade them to peace, saying, Men, you are brothers: why do you injure one another?
044	ACT	007	027	But he that was doing the injury to his neighbor, thrust him away, saying, Who made you a ruler or a judge over us?
044	ACT	007	028	Do you intend to kill me, as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?
044	ACT	007	029	And at that saying Moses fled, and became a resident in the land of Midian, where he begot two sons.
044	ACT	007	030	And when forty years were completed, there appeared to him, in the wilderness of Mount Sinai, an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a bush.
044	ACT	007	031	When Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight, and as he was drawing near to observe it, the voice of the Lord came to him:
044	ACT	007	032	I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses trembled, and durst not observe it.
044	ACT	007	033	Then said the Lord to him: Loose your shoes from your feet; for the place in which you stand is holy ground.
044	ACT	007	034	I have surely seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and I have come down to deliver them; and now come, and I will send you into Egypt.
044	ACT	007	035	This Moses, whom they rejected, saying, Who made you a ruler and a judge? him God sent as a ruler and as a redeemer, by the hand of the angel that appeared to him in the bush.
044	ACT	007	036	He brought them out, after he had performed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and at the Red Sea, and in the wilderness, forty years.
044	ACT	007	037	This is that Moses, who said to the sons of Israel, A prophet like me will the Lord your God raise up for you from among your brethren; him shall you hear.
044	ACT	007	038	This is he who was in the congregation in the wilderness with the angel that spoke to him in the mount Sina, and with our fathers; he received the living oracles, that he might give them to us.
044	ACT	007	039	To him our fathers were not willing to be obedient; but they rejected him, and turned back in their hearts to Egypt,
044	ACT	007	040	saying to Aaron: Make us gods that shall go before us; for, as for this Moses, who brought us out of the land of Egypt, we know not what has become of him.
044	ACT	007	041	And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice to the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands.
044	ACT	007	042	But God turned and delivered them up to serve the host of heaven, as it is written in the book of the prophets: Your victims and your sacrifices did you offer to me for forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?
044	ACT	007	043	Yes, you took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your God Remphan, images which you made to worship; and I will carry you away beyond Babylon.
044	ACT	007	044	The tabernacle of the testimony was with our fathers in the wilderness, built as he who spoke to Moses commanded him to build it, according to the pattern which he had seen:
044	ACT	007	045	which our fathers, who were with Joshua, received by succession, and brought into the land possessed by the Gentiles, whom God continued to drive out from the face of our fathers till the days of David,
044	ACT	007	046	who found favor before God, and desired to find a dwelling-place for the God of Jacob.
044	ACT	007	047	But Solomon built him a house.
044	ACT	007	048	Yet the Most High dwells not in temples made with hands, as says the prophet:
044	ACT	007	049	Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool. What house will you build me? says the Lord; or what is the place of my rest?
044	ACT	007	050	Has not my hand made all these things?
044	ACT	007	051	You stiff-necked, and uncircumcised in heart and in ears, you do always resist the Holy Spirit; as your fathers did, so also do you.
044	ACT	007	052	Which of the prophets did not your fathers persecute? They slew also those who foretold the coming of the Just One, of whom you have now become the betrayers and murderers;
044	ACT	007	053	who received the law by the appointment of angels, and have not kepi, it.
044	ACT	007	054	When they heard these things, they were enraged in their hearts, and gnashed upon him with their teeth.
044	ACT	007	055	But being full of the Holy Spirit, he looked earnestly up into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God;
044	ACT	007	056	and he said: Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing at the right hand of God.
044	ACT	007	057	And they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and, with one consent, rushed upon him,
044	ACT	007	058	and drove him out of the city, and stoned him. And the witnesses laid down their clothes at the feet of a young man called Saul.
044	ACT	007	059	And they stoned Stephen while he was calling on the Lord, and saying: Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.
044	ACT	007	060	And he kneeled down and cried with a loud voice: Lord, let not this sin stand against them. And when he had said this, he fell asleep. And Saul was well pleased with his death.
044	ACT	008	001	And at that time there was a great persecution against the church that was in Jerusalem; and they were all dispersed throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles.
044	ACT	008	002	But devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him.
044	ACT	008	003	But Saul attempted to destroy the church; entering every house, and dragging men and women, he delivered them up to prison.
044	ACT	008	004	Then they that were dispersed went everywhere preaching the word.
044	ACT	008	005	And Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached the Christ to them.
044	ACT	008	006	And the multitudes with one mind gave heed to the things which were spoken by Philip, when they heard, and saw the signs which he did.
044	ACT	008	007	For unclean spirits, crying with a loud voice, came out of many that were possessed with them, and many paralytics and lame persons were cured.
044	ACT	008	008	And there was great joy in that city.
044	ACT	008	009	But there was a certain man, named Simon, who had, before this time, been practicing magic in the city, and astonishing the people of Samaria, saying that he was some great one;
044	ACT	008	010	to whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying: This man is the great power of God.
044	ACT	008	011	And they gave heed to him because he had, for a long time, astonished them with his magic arts.
044	ACT	008	012	But when they believed Philip, who preached the good news concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were immersed, both men and women.
044	ACT	008	013	And Simon himself also believed; and after he was immersed, he continued with Philip; and, seeing the mighty deeds and the signs which were done, he was astonished.
044	ACT	008	014	Now when the apostles, who were in Jerusalem, heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent to them Peter and John;
044	ACT	008	015	who, when they had gone down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit.
044	ACT	008	016	For he had not yet fallen on any of them; only they had been immersed into the name of the Lord Jesus.
044	ACT	008	017	Then they laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.
044	ACT	008	018	And when Simon saw that the Holy Spirit was given through the laying on of the hands of the apostles, he offered them money,
044	ACT	008	019	saying: Give me, also, this authority, that whoever I shall lay my hands on, may receive the Holy Spirit.
044	ACT	008	020	But Peter said to him: Your money perish with you, because you thought that the gift of God might be purchased with money.
044	ACT	008	021	You have neither part nor share in this matter; for your heart is not right in the sight of God.
044	ACT	008	022	Repent, therefore, of this your wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the purpose of your heart may be forgiven you.
044	ACT	008	023	For I perceive that you are in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity.
044	ACT	008	024	But Simon answered and said: Pray you both to the Lord for me, that none of the things which you have spoken come upon me.
044	ACT	008	025	Then, when they had given their testimony, and preached the word of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.
044	ACT	008	026	And an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying: Arise, and go toward the south, to the road that leads from Jerusalem to Gaza; this is desert.
044	ACT	008	027	And he arose and went. And behold, a man of Ethiopia, a eunuch of great authority under Candace, the queen of the Ethiopians, who had charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem to worship,
044	ACT	008	028	was returning, and, sitting in his chariot, read the prophet Isaiah.
044	ACT	008	029	And the Spirit said to Philip: Go forward and join yourself to this chariot.
044	ACT	008	030	And Philip ran forward, and heard him reading the prophet Isaiah; and he said: Do you understand what you are reading?
044	ACT	008	031	He answered: How can I, unless some one instruct me? And he invited Philip to come up and sit with him.
044	ACT	008	032	The passage of the scripture which he was reading, was this: As a sheep for the slaughter was he led; and as a lamb before his shearer is dumb, so opened he not his mouth
044	ACT	008	033	in his humiliation. The sentence against him was taken away; but who shall describe the men of his generation? For his life was taken from the earth.
044	ACT	008	034	And the eunuch answered Philip, and said: I pray you, of whom speaks the prophet this? Of himself, or of some other man?
044	ACT	008	035	And Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached to him Jesus.
044	ACT	008	036	And as they went along the road, they came to some water; and the eunuch said: See, here is water; what hinders me from being immersed?
044	ACT	008	038	And he commanded the chariot to stand still; and they both went down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch, and he immersed him.
044	ACT	008	039	And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip; and the eunuch saw him no more, for he went on his way rejoicing.
044	ACT	008	040	But Philip was found at Azotus, and, passing through, he preached the gospel in all the cities, till he came to Cæsarea
044	ACT	009	001	And Saul, still breathing out threatening and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went to the chief priest,
044	ACT	009	002	and asked of him letters to Damascus, for the synagogues, that, if he should find any who were of this persuasion, either men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.
044	ACT	009	003	And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus; and suddenly there shone round about him a light from heaven.
044	ACT	009	004	And when he had fallen to the earth, he heard a voice saying to him: Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?
044	ACT	009	005	He answered: Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said: I am Jesus, whom you persecute.
044	ACT	009	006	But rise, and go into the city, and it shall be told you what you must do.
044	ACT	009	007	The men who journeyed with him stood amazed; for they heard a voice, but saw no one.
044	ACT	009	008	And Saul arose from the earth, and when his eyes were opened, he saw no one; but they led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus.
044	ACT	009	009	And he was three days without sight, and neither ate nor drank.
044	ACT	009	010	Now there was a certain disciple in Damascus, named Ananias; and the Lord said to him in a vision: Ananias. He answered: Behold me, Lord.
044	ACT	009	011	And the Lord said to him: Arise, and go into the street that is called Straight, and inquire at the house of Judas for one called Saul of Tarsus: for behold, he is praying;
044	ACT	009	012	and he has seen in a vision a man named Ananias, coming in and laying his hand on him, that he may receive his sight.
044	ACT	009	013	But Ananias answered: Lord, I have heard from many of this man, how much evil he has done to thy saints in Jerusalem;
044	ACT	009	014	and here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all that call upon thy name.
044	ACT	009	015	But the Lord said to him: Go; for he is a vessel chosen by me to bear my name before nations and kings, and the sons of Israel.
044	ACT	009	016	For I will show him what great things he must suffer for my name.
044	ACT	009	017	And Ananias went, and entered the house, and laying his hands on him, said: Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, who appeared to you on the road by which you came, has sent me, that you may receive your sight, and be filled with the Holy Spirit.
044	ACT	009	018	And immediately there fell from his eyes something like scales, and he instantly received his sight; and he arose, and was immersed.
044	ACT	009	019	And, having taken food, he was strengthened. And he was with the disciples in Damascus for some days;
044	ACT	009	020	and immediately he preached Jesus in the synagogues, that he is the Sou of God.
044	ACT	009	021	And all that heard him were astonished, and said: Is not this he who destroyed in Jerusalem those that call on this name, and who has come hither for this purpose, that he might carry them bound to the chief priests?
044	ACT	009	022	But Saul increased the more in strength, and confuted the Jews that dwelt in Damascus, proving that this is the Christ.
044	ACT	009	023	And, after many days had passed, the Jews determined to kill him.
044	ACT	009	024	And their plot was made known to Saul; and they watched the gates day and night, that they might kill him.
044	ACT	009	025	But the disciples took him by night, and let him down through the vail in a basket,
044	ACT	009	026	And having come to Jerusalem, he attempted to associate with the disciples: and they were all afraid of him, for they did not believe that he was a disciple.
044	ACT	009	027	But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and told them how he had seen the Lord on the road, and that he had spoken to him, and how he had boldly preached in Damascus in the name of Jesus.
044	ACT	009	028	And he was with them in Jerusalem, coming in and going out; and, speaking boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus,
044	ACT	009	029	he conversed and reasoned with the Hellenists; but they undertook to kill him.
044	ACT	009	030	And when the brethren learned this, they brought him down to Cæsarea, and sent him out to Tarsus.
044	ACT	009	031	Then the churches throughout the whole of Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace, and were edified; and, walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, they were multiplied.
044	ACT	009	032	And it came to pass that Peter, passing through all the places, came down also to the saints that dwelt in Lydda.
044	ACT	009	033	And he found there a certain man named Æneas, who was a paralytic, and had kept his bed for eight years.
044	ACT	009	034	And Peter said to him: Æneas, Jesus the Christ restores you to health; arise, and spread your bed for yourself. And he immediately arose;
044	ACT	009	035	and all that dwelt in Lydda and Saron saw him; and they turned to the Lord.
044	ACT	009	036	Now there was in Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which name, when translated, is Dorcas. She was full of good works and deeds of charity which she did.
044	ACT	009	037	And it came to pass, in those days, that she was taken sick, and died. And when they had washed her, they laid her in an upper room.
044	ACT	009	038	And as Lydda was near to Joppa, the disciples, having heard that Peter was there, sent two men to him, requesting him to make no delay in coming to them.
044	ACT	009	039	Then Peter arose, and went with them; and when he had come, they brought him into the upper room; and all the widows stood by him weeping, and showing the coats and garments that Dorcas made while she was with them.
044	ACT	009	040	But Peter put them all out, and kneeled down and prayed; and turning to the body, he said: Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes; and when she saw Peter, she sat up.
044	ACT	009	041	And he gave her his hand, and raised her up. And when he had called in the saints and the widows, he presented her alive.
044	ACT	009	042	And it was known throughout all Joppa, and many believed on the Lord.
044	ACT	009	043	And it came to pass, that he remained many days in Joppa with one Simon, a tanner.
044	ACT	010	001	Now there was a certain man in Cæsarea, named Cornelius, a centurion of the band called the Italian band,
044	ACT	010	002	a devout man, and one that feared God with all his house, who did many acts of charity to the people, and prayed to God always.
044	ACT	010	003	He distinctly saw, in a vision, about the ninth hour of the day, an angel of God coming in to him, and saying to him, Cornelius.
044	ACT	010	004	And having looked steadily on him, he was afraid, and said: What is it, Lord? He said to him: Your prayers and your charitable deeds have come up for a memorial before God.
044	ACT	010	005	And now send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, who is surnamed Peter;
044	ACT	010	006	he lodges with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea.
044	ACT	010	007	When the angel who spoke to him had departed, he called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier, one of those who waited on him,
044	ACT	010	008	and having made known all things to them, he sent them to Joppa.
044	ACT	010	009	And on the morrow, as they were going on their journey, and were drawing near to the city, Peter went up on the house-top to pray, about the sixth hour.
044	ACT	010	010	And he became very hungry, and desired to eat; but while they were making ready, he fell into a trance;
044	ACT	010	011	and he saw heaven opened, and some vessel, like a great sheet, descending, bound by the four corners, and let down to the earth.
044	ACT	010	012	In this were all kinds of four-footed beasts of the earth, and wild beasts and creeping things and birds of the air.
044	ACT	010	013	And there came a voice to him: Rise, Peter, kill and eat.
044	ACT	010	014	But Peter said: By no means, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing common or unclean.
044	ACT	010	015	And the voice came to him again a second time: What God has cleansed, you must not call common.
044	ACT	010	016	This was done the third time; and the vessel was taken up again into heaven.
044	ACT	010	017	Now, while Peter was perplexed within himself about the meaning of the vision which he had seen, behold, the men who had been sent from Cornelius, having made inquiry for the house of Simon, stood before the gate.
044	ACT	010	018	And they called and asked whether Simon, who was surnamed Peter, lodged there.
044	ACT	010	019	While Peter was thinking of the vision, the Spirit said to him: Behold, three men ask for you:
044	ACT	010	020	arise then, and go down, and go with them without hesitation, for I have sent them.
044	ACT	010	021	And Peter came down to the men, and said: Behold, I am he whom you seek; what is the cause of your coming?
044	ACT	010	022	They replied: Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that fears God, and of good report among the whole nation of the Jews, was instructed by a holy angel to call you to his house, and to hear words from you.
044	ACT	010	023	Then he called them in, and lodged them. On the morrow he arose, and went with them; and some of the brethren from Joppa accompanied him.
044	ACT	010	024	And on the next day, they entered Cæsarea And Cornelius was expecting them, and had called together his relatives and near friends.
044	ACT	010	025	And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and did him homage.
044	ACT	010	026	But Peter raised him up, saying: Stand up; I also am a man.
044	ACT	010	027	And; conversing with him, he went in, and found many that had come together.
044	ACT	010	028	And he said to them: You know that it is unlawful for a Jew to associate with one of another nation, or to go into his house. But God has showed me that I must not call any man common or unclean.
044	ACT	010	029	For this reason, when I was sent for, I came without making objection. I ask, therefore, for what purpose have you sent for me?
044	ACT	010	030	And Cornelius replied: Four days ago, I was fasting till this hour; and, at the ninth hour, I was praying in my house; and behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,
044	ACT	010	031	and said: Cornelius, your prayer is heard, and your deeds of charity are remembered before God.
044	ACT	010	032	Send, therefore, to Joppa, and call for Simon, who is surnamed Peter: he lodges in the house of Simon a tanner, by the sea; who, when he comes, will speak to you.
044	ACT	010	033	Therefore, I immediately sent to you; and you have done well in coming. Now, therefore, we are all here present before God, to hear all things that are given in charge to you by God.
044	ACT	010	034	And Peter opened his mouth, and said: In truth, I perceive that God is no respecter of persons;
044	ACT	010	035	but, in every nation, he that fears him and works righteousness is accepted by him.
044	ACT	010	036	The word which he sent to the sons of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ, (he is Lord of all, )
044	ACT	010	037	that word, you know, which was published through the whole of Judea, beginning from Galilee, after the immersion that John preached;
044	ACT	010	038	how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit, and with power; who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed by the devil; for God was with him.
044	ACT	010	039	And we are witnesses of all that he did, both in the country of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew by hanging him on a tree.
044	ACT	010	040	Him God raised up the third day, and caused him to appear,
044	ACT	010	041	not to all the people, but to witnesses who were before appointed by God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him, after he rose from the dead.
044	ACT	010	042	And he commanded us to preach to the people, and to testify that this is he who has been appointed by God as the judge of the living and the dead.
044	ACT	010	043	To him all the prophets bear testimony, that whoever believes on him shall receive remission of sins through his name.
044	ACT	010	044	While Peter was speaking these things, the Holy Spirit fell on all that heard the word.
044	ACT	010	045	And the believers that were of the circumcision, as many as had come with Peter, were astonished, because on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Spirit:
044	ACT	010	046	for they heard them speaking with tongues, and magnifying God. Then Peter answered:
044	ACT	010	047	Can any one forbid the water, that these should not be immersed, who have received the Holy Spirit as well as we?
044	ACT	010	048	And he commanded them to be immersed in the name of the Lord. Then they besought him to remain some days.
044	ACT	011	001	And the apostles and brethren that were in Judea, heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God.
044	ACT	011	002	And when Peter went up to Jerusalem, those who were of the circumcision contended with him,
044	ACT	011	003	saying: You went in to uncircumcised men, and ate with them.
044	ACT	011	004	And Peter began, and laid the matter before them in order, saying:
044	ACT	011	005	I was in the city of Joppa, praying; and, while in a trance, I saw a vision, some vessel like a great sheet, descending, let down from heaven by the four corners; and it came even to me.
044	ACT	011	006	When I had looked attentively into it, I observed and saw four-footed beasts of the earth, and wild beasts and creeping things and birds of the air.
044	ACT	011	007	And I heard a voice saying to me, Rise, Peter, kill and eat.
044	ACT	011	008	But I said, By no means, Lord; for nothing common or unclean has ever entered my mouth.
044	ACT	011	009	But the voice answered me a second time from heaven, What God has cleansed, you must not call common.
044	ACT	011	010	This was done the third time, and all was drawn up again into heaven.
044	ACT	011	011	And behold, three men who had been sent to me from Cæsarea, immediately came to the house where I was.
044	ACT	011	012	And the Spirit commanded me to go with them without hesitation. And these six brethren accompanied me. And we entered the man’s house:
044	ACT	011	013	and he told us how he had seen an angel in his house, standing and saying to him, Send to Joppa and call for Simon, who is surnamed Peter;
044	ACT	011	014	he will tell you words by which you and all your house shall be saved.
044	ACT	011	015	And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them, as on us at the beginning.
044	ACT	011	016	Then I remembered the word of the Lord, as he said, John immersed in water, but you shall be immersed in the Holy Spirit.
044	ACT	011	017	If, then, God gave them the like gift that he gave to us who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, what was I, that I could withstand God?
044	ACT	011	018	And when they heard these things, they ceased to contend; and they glorified God, saying: Then, indeed, has God given to the Gentiles also repentance in order to life.
044	ACT	011	019	Now those who had been dispersed by the persecution that arose after the death of Stephen, traveled as far as Phenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, speaking the word to none but Jews.
044	ACT	011	020	But some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who, when they had come to Antioch, spoke to the Grecians, preaching the Lord Jesus.
044	ACT	011	021	And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number believed, and turned to the Lord.
044	ACT	011	022	And the report concerning them came to the ears of the church that was in Jerusalem; and they sent out Barnabas to go as far as Antioch.
044	ACT	011	023	When he had come, and had seen the grace of God, he rejoiced; and he exhorted them all to remain, with purpose of heart, faithful to the Lord.
044	ACT	011	024	For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. And a great multitude was added to the Lord.
044	ACT	011	025	And Barnabas went to Tarsus, to seek for Saul;
044	ACT	011	026	and when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. And it came to pass, that they met together in the church for a whole year, and taught a great multitude; and the disciples were called Christians first at Antioch.
044	ACT	011	027	In those days prophets came from Jerusalem to Antioch.
044	ACT	011	028	And one of them, named Agabus, rose and made known, by the Spirit, that a great famine was about to come on the whole habitable land; which took place in the days of Claudius.
044	ACT	011	029	And every one of the disciples determined, as he had the means, to send relief to the brethren that dwelt in Judea;
044	ACT	011	030	which also they did; and they sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.
044	ACT	012	001	At that time Herod the king undertook to afflict some of the church.
044	ACT	012	002	And he slew with the sword James the brother of John.
044	ACT	012	003	And when he saw that it pleased the Jews, he apprehended Peter also. Those were the days of unleavened bread.
044	ACT	012	004	And when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four tetrads of soldiers to guard him, intending to bring him out to the people after the passover.
044	ACT	012	005	Therefore, Peter was kept in prison; but fervent prayer to God was made for him by the church.
044	ACT	012	006	When Herod was about to bring him out, on that night, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains; and the keepers before the doors were guarding the prison.
044	ACT	012	007	And behold, an angel of the Lord stood by him, and a light shone in the prison. And he gently struck Peter on the side, and awoke him, saying: Arise quickly; and his chains fell from his hands.
044	ACT	012	008	And the angel said to him: Gird yourself, and bind on your sandals; and he did so. And he said to him: Throw your mantle around you, and follow me.
044	ACT	012	009	And he went out, and followed him; and he knew not that what was done by the angel was real, but thought that he saw a vision.
044	ACT	012	010	And when they had passed through the first and the second guard, they came to the iron gate that leads to the city, which opened to them of its own accord. And they went out, and passed on through one street; and the angel immediately departed from him.
044	ACT	012	011	And when Peter came to himself, he said: Now I know, in truth, that the Lord has sent his angel, and has delivered me from the hand of Herod, and from all that was expected by the Jewish people.
044	ACT	012	012	And being aware of his condition, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, who is surnamed Mark, where many had met together, and were praying.
044	ACT	012	013	And when he knocked at the door of the entrance, a maid-servant, named Rhoda, came to listen.
044	ACT	012	014	And recognizing Peter’s voice, she did not open the entrance for joy, but ran in and told that Peter was standing before the entrance.
044	ACT	012	015	And they said to her: You are mad. But she confidently affirmed that it was even so. Then said hey: It is his angel.
044	ACT	012	016	But Peter continued to knock; and when they had opened the door, they saw him, and were astonished.
044	ACT	012	017	But, having made a sign to them with his hand, that they should keep silence, he made known to them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison, and he said: Tell this to James, and to the brethren. And he went out, and departed to another place.
044	ACT	012	018	And when it was day, there was no little confusion among the soldiers as to what had become of Peter.
044	ACT	012	019	But Herod, when he had sought for him, and found him not, examined the keepers, and commanded them to be put to death. And he went down from Judea to Cesarean, and there he remained.
044	ACT	012	020	And he was intending to make war upon the Tyrians and Sidonians; but they came with one consent to him; and having made Blastus, who had charge of the king’s bed-chamber, their friend, they asked for peace, because their country was supported by that of the king.
044	ACT	012	021	And on an appointed day, Herod, having arrayed himself in royal apparel, and seated himself on his throne, delivered an oration to them.
044	ACT	012	022	And the people shouted: It is the voice of God, and not of man.
044	ACT	012	023	And immediately an angel of the Lord smote him, because he did not give God the glory. And having been eaten by worms, he expired.
044	ACT	012	024	But the word of the Lord increased and multiplied.
044	ACT	012	025	And Barnabas and Saul, after they had fulfilled their ministry, returned from Jerusalem, taking with them John, whose surname was Mark.
044	ACT	013	001	Now there were certain prophets and teachers in the church that was at Antioch; Barnabas, and Simeon, who is called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, who was brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.
044	ACT	013	002	And while they were ministering to the Lord, and fasting, the Holy Spirit said: Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul, to the work to which I have called them.
044	ACT	013	003	Then, after they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.
044	ACT	013	004	Therefore, having been sent forth by the Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleucia, and thence sailed to Cyprus.
044	ACT	013	005	And while they were in Salamis, they preached the word of God in the synagogue of the Jews; and they had John as their attendant.
044	ACT	013	006	And having gone through the island as far as Paphos, they found a certain magician, a Jewish false prophet, whose name was Bar-jesus;
044	ACT	013	007	and he was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, who was a man of intelligence. This man called for Barnabas and Saul, and expressed an earnest wish to hear the word of God.
044	ACT	013	008	But the magician Elymas (for this is his name, when translated) withstood them, desiring to turn away the proconsul from the faith.
044	ACT	013	009	Then Saul, who is also called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, and looking earnestly upon him,
044	ACT	013	010	said: O full of all deceit and all wickedness, child of the devil, enemy of all righteousness, will you not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?
044	ACT	013	011	And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon you, and you shall be blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness, and he went about and sought some to lead him by the hand.
044	ACT	013	012	Then the proconsul, seeing what was done, believed, being amazed at the teaching of the Lord.
044	ACT	013	013	And Paul and his companions put to sea from Paphos, and went to Perga in Pamphylia. But John withdrew from them, and returned to Jerusalem.
044	ACT	013	014	But having passed through from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia; and on the sabbath-day they went into the synagogue, and sat down.
044	ACT	013	015	After the reading of the law and the prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent to them, saying: Brethren, if you have a word of exhortation for the people, speak.
044	ACT	013	016	Then Paul arose, and waving his hand, said: Men of Israel, and you who fear God, give audience.
044	ACT	013	017	The God of this people chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they sojourned in the land of Egypt, and with an uplifted arm he brought them out from it.
044	ACT	013	018	And for about forty years, he cherished them in the wilderness.
044	ACT	013	019	And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Chanaan, he divided their land among them by lot.
044	ACT	013	020	And after that he gave them judges, for about four hundred and fifty years, till Samuel the prophet.
044	ACT	013	021	And afterward they asked for a king, and God gave them Saul the son of Kis, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years.
044	ACT	013	022	And when he had removed him, he raised up David to be their king; to whom he gave this testimony: I have found David the son of Jesse a man after my own heart, who will do all my will.
044	ACT	013	023	From the posterity of this man, God, according to his promise, raised up for Israel a Savior, Jesus;
044	ACT	013	024	John having first preached, before his coming, the immersion of repentance to all the people of Israel.
044	ACT	013	025	And as John was finishing his course, he said: Who do you suppose that I am? I am not he; but behold, there is coming after me one, the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to loose.
044	ACT	013	026	Brethren, sons of the family of Abraham, and those among you who fear God, to you is the word of this salvation sent.
044	ACT	013	027	For those who dwell in Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they did not know him, nor the words of the prophets, which are read every sabbath-day, have fulfilled them in condemning him.
044	ACT	013	028	And though they found no cause of death, yet they demanded of Pilate that he should be slain.
044	ACT	013	029	And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a sepulcher.
044	ACT	013	030	But God raised him from the dead.
044	ACT	013	031	And he was seen for many days by those who came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses to the people.
044	ACT	013	032	And we preach to you good news concerning the promise made to our fathers,
044	ACT	013	033	that God has fulfilled the same to us, their children, by raising up Jesus, as it is written in the second Psalm: Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.
044	ACT	013	034	But that he raised him from the dead, no more to return to corruption, he has spoken thus: I will give you the sure mercies of David.
044	ACT	013	035	For which reason he says also in another Psalm: Thou wilt not suffer thy Holy One to see corruption.
044	ACT	013	036	For David, after serving the purpose of God in his own generation, fell asleep, and was laid with his fathers, and saw corruption.
044	ACT	013	037	But he whom God raised up did not see corruption.
044	ACT	013	038	Be it known to you, therefore, brethren, that through this man is preached to you the remission of sins:
044	ACT	013	039	and by him, every one that believes is justified from all things, from which you could not be justified by the law of Moses.
044	ACT	013	040	Take heed, therefore, lest that which is spoken in the prophets come upon you:
044	ACT	013	041	Behold, you despisers, and wonder, and perish. For I work a work in your days, a work which you will not believe, though one fully declare it to you.
044	ACT	013	042	And as they were departing from the synagogue, they were requested to speak these things to them on the next sabbath.
044	ACT	013	043	Now, after the congregation was dismissed, many of the Jews and religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas, who spoke to them, and persuaded them to continue faithful to the grace of God.
044	ACT	013	044	And on the next sabbath-day, almost the whole city met together to hear the word of God.
044	ACT	013	045	But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy, and spoke against those things which were spoken by Paul, contradicting and reviling.
044	ACT	013	046	But Paul and Barnabas, speaking boldly, said: It was necessary that the word of God should be spoken to you first: but since you reject it, and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, lo! we turn to tho Gentiles.
044	ACT	013	047	For thus has the Lord given us commandment: I have placed thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be for salvation to the most distant part of the earth.
044	ACT	013	048	When the Gentiles heard this they rejoiced, and glorified the word of the Lord; and as many as were determined to obtain eternal life, believed.
044	ACT	013	049	And the word of the Lord was published throughout the whole of that region.
044	ACT	013	050	But the Jews in cited the devout and influential women, and the first men of the city, and raised a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them from their borders.
044	ACT	013	051	But they shook off the dust from their feet against them, and went to Iconium.
044	ACT	013	052	And the disciples were filled with joy and the Holy Spirit.
044	ACT	014	001	And it came to pass in Iconium, that they went together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spoke that a great multitude of the Jews and Greeks believed.
044	ACT	014	002	But the unbelieving Jews excited and embittered the minds of the Gentiles against the brethren.
044	ACT	014	003	Therefore, they continued a long time, and spoke boldly in the Lord, who gave testimony to the word of his grace, by granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands.
044	ACT	014	004	But the multitude of the city were divided; and some were with the Jews, and some with the apostles.
044	ACT	014	005	But when there was a violent purpose on the part of the Gentiles and of the Jews, with their rulers, to outrage and to stone them,
044	ACT	014	006	being aware of it, they fled to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra, and Derbe, and to the region round about,
044	ACT	014	007	and there they preached the gospel.
044	ACT	014	008	And there was a certain man in Lystra, without strength in his feet, who sat, for he was a cripple from his mother’s womb, and had never walked.
044	ACT	014	009	This man heard Paul speak, who, looking earnestly on him, and seeing that he had faith to be saved,
044	ACT	014	010	said, with a loud voice: Stand erect upon your feet. And he leaped and walked.
044	ACT	014	011	When the multitude saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voice, and said, in the Lycaonian language: The Gods have come down to us in the likeness of men.
044	ACT	014	012	And they called Barnabas, Jupiter, and Paul, Mercury, for he was the chief speaker.
044	ACT	014	013	Then the priest of Jupiter, whose temple was before the city, having brought bulls and garlands to the entrance, intended to offer sacrifice, with the multitudes.
044	ACT	014	014	But when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of it, they rent their clothes, and ran in among the multitude, crying out,
044	ACT	014	015	and saying: Men, why are you doing these things? We also are human beings, with passions like your own, and we preach the gospel to you, that you may turn from these vanities to the living God, who made the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and all things that are in them;
044	ACT	014	016	who, in past generations, permitted all the nations to walk in their own ways;
044	ACT	014	017	and yet he did not leave himself without testimony, doing good, and giving you rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with food and gladness.
044	ACT	014	018	And with these words they hardly restrained the multitudes from offering sacrifice to them.
044	ACT	014	019	Then came thither, from Antioch and Iconium, Jews, who persuaded the multitudes; and having stoned Paul, they dragged him out of the city, supposing that he was dead.
044	ACT	014	020	But while the disciples were standing around him, he arose, and went into the city. And on the next day, he departed with Barnabas to Derbe;
044	ACT	014	021	and when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had made many disciples, they returned to Lystra, and to Iconium, and to Antioch,
044	ACT	014	022	strengthening the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to continue in the faith, and saying, that through many afflictions we mast enter the kingdom of God.
044	ACT	014	023	And when they had appointed elders for them in every church, with prayer and fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they believed.
044	ACT	014	024	And having passed through Pisidia, they came into Pamphylia;
044	ACT	014	025	and when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia:
044	ACT	014	026	thence they sailed to Antioch, from which place they had been commended to the grace of God, for the work which they had accomplished.
044	ACT	014	027	And having come and called together the church, they reported all that God had done with them, and that he had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles.
044	ACT	014	028	And they continued a long time with the disciples.
044	ACT	015	001	And certain men came down from Judea, and taught the brethren, saying: Unless you be circumcised, according to the custom of Moses, you can not be saved.
044	ACT	015	002	Therefore, after Paul and Barnabas had no little dissension and disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain others from among them, should go up to Jerusalem, to the apostles and elders, about this question.
044	ACT	015	003	Being, therefore, con ducted on their journey by the church, they passed through Phenicia and Samaria, making known the conversion of the Gentiles; and they gave great joy to all the brethren.
044	ACT	015	004	When they arrived at Jerusalem, they were received by the church, and the apostles and elders, and they declared all that God had done with them.
044	ACT	015	005	But some of the sect of the Pharisees, who believed, arose, saying, that it was necessary to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses.
044	ACT	015	006	And the apostles and elders came together to deliberate about this matter.
044	ACT	015	007	And after there had been much disputing, Peter arose, and said to them: Brethren, you know that, at the beginning, God made choice among us, that, by my mouth, the Gentiles should hear the word of the Gospel, and believe.
044	ACT	015	008	And God, who knows the heart, became a witness for them, by giving them the Holy Spirit, as he gave it also to us;
044	ACT	015	009	and he made no distinction between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.
044	ACT	015	010	Now, therefore, why do you put God to the proof, by placing a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers, nor we ourselves, were able to bear?
044	ACT	015	011	But we believe that we shall be saved, even as they, through the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ.
044	ACT	015	012	Then all the multitude kept silence, and listened to Barnabas and Paul, while they made known what signs and wonders God had done by them among the Gentiles.
044	ACT	015	013	And after they were silent, James answered and said: Brethren, hear me;
044	ACT	015	014	Simeon has declared how God, at the first, did visit the Gentiles, in order to take out from among them a people for his name.
044	ACT	015	015	And with this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written,
044	ACT	015	016	After this I will return, and build again the tabernacle of David which has fallen down; and I will build again its ruins, and I will set it up;
044	ACT	015	017	that the rest of men may seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, upon whom my name has been called, says the Lord, who does all these things.
044	ACT	015	018	Known to God from eternity are all bis works.
044	ACT	015	019	For these reasons, my judgment is, that we give no trouble to those who, from among the Gentiles, have turned to God;
044	ACT	015	020	but that we write to them to abstain from pollutions of idols, and from lewdness, and from what is strangled, and from blood.
044	ACT	015	021	For, from ancient times, Moses has, in every city, those who preach him, being read in the synagogue every sabbath-day.
044	ACT	015	022	Then it pleased the apostles and the elders, with the whole church, to send to Antioch, with Paul and Barnabas, chosen men from among themselves; Judas, who was surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, chief men among the brethren;
044	ACT	015	023	and they wrote by their hands as follows: The apostles, and the elders, and the brethren, to the brethren of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia, greeting:
044	ACT	015	024	Inasmuch as we have heard that certain persons went out from us and troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, That you must be circumcised, and keep the law, to whom we gave no commandment,
044	ACT	015	025	it has seemed good to us, having come together with one mind, to send chosen men to you, with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,
044	ACT	015	026	men who have endangered their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
044	ACT	015	027	We have sent, therefore, Judas and Silas, who will tell you the same things in word.
044	ACT	015	028	For it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things:
044	ACT	015	029	That you abstain from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what is strangled, and from lewdness; from which if you keep yourselves carefully, you will do well. Farewell.
044	ACT	015	030	So when these men were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and having assembled the multitude, they delivered this letter.
044	ACT	015	031	When they had read it, they rejoiced for the consolation which it gave.
044	ACT	015	032	And Judas and Silas, who were also prophets, exhorted the brethren with many words, and strengthened them.
044	ACT	015	033	And after spending some time, they were dismissed in peace from the brethren, to those who had sent them.
044	ACT	015	034	But it pleased Silas to remain there.
044	ACT	015	035	Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and preaching, with many others, the word of the Lord.
044	ACT	015	036	And, after some days, Paul said to Barnabas, let us return, and visit our brethren in every city in which we have preached the word of the Lord, and see how they do.
044	ACT	015	037	And Barnabas determined to take with him John, whose surname was Mark.
044	ACT	015	038	But Paul did not think it proper to take with them him who had departed from them from Pamphylia, and did not go with them to the work.
044	ACT	015	039	There was, therefore, a sharp contention, so that they separated from each other: and Barnabas took Mark, and sailed to Cyprus.
044	ACT	015	040	But Paul chose Silas, and departed, having been commended to the grace of God by the brethren.
044	ACT	015	041	And he passed through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches.
044	ACT	016	001	And he came to Derbe and Lystra; and behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a Jewess, who was a believer; but his father was a Greek.
044	ACT	016	002	A good report was given of him by the brethren in Lystra and Iconium.
044	ACT	016	003	This man Paul wished to go with him: and he took him and circumcised him, on account of the Jews that were in those places: for they all knew that his father was a Greek.
044	ACT	016	004	And as they went through the cities, they delivered to them the decrees that had been resolved on by the apostles and elders at Jerusalem, that they might keep them.
044	ACT	016	005	Therefore, the churches were established in the faith, and they increased in number daily.
044	ACT	016	006	When they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, being forbidden by the Holy Spirit to preach the word in Asia,
044	ACT	016	007	and had come to Mysia, they attempted to go into Bithynia; and the Spirit did not permit them.
044	ACT	016	008	But having passed by Mysia, they came down to Troas.
044	ACT	016	009	And, during the night, a vision appeared to Paul. A certain man of Macedonia stood and besought him, saying: Come over to Macedonia and help us.
044	ACT	016	010	After he had seen the vision, we immediately endeavored to go into Macedonia, concluding that the Lord had called us to preach the gospel to them.
044	ACT	016	011	Therefore, setting sail from Troas, we came by a straight course to Samothracia, and, on the following day, to Neapolis,
044	ACT	016	012	and thence to Philippi, which is the first city of that part of Macedonia, and a colony. We remained in that city some days:
044	ACT	016	013	and on the sabbath-day we went out of the city to the side of a river, where, as usual, was the house of prayer; and we sat down and spoke to the women who had come together.
044	ACT	016	014	And a certain woman, named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, who worshiped God, heard; whose heart the Lord opened to attend to the things that were spoken by Paul.
044	ACT	016	015	And when she and her household had been immersed, she besought us, saying: If you judge me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and make it your home. And she con strained us.
044	ACT	016	016	And it came to pass, that as we were going to the house of prayer, there met us a certain maid-servant that had a spirit of Python, who brought much gain to her masters, by giving responses.
044	ACT	016	017	She followed Paul and us, and cried out, saying: These men are the servants of the most High God, who show us the way of salvation.
044	ACT	016	018	And this she continued to do for many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit: I command you, in the name of Jesus Christ, to come out of her. And it came out that very hour.
044	ACT	016	019	And when her masters saw that the hope of their gain was gone, they seized Paul and Silas, and dragged them into the market to the rulers.
044	ACT	016	020	And having brought them to the magistrates, they said: These men, who are Jews, do greatly trouble our city;
044	ACT	016	021	and they teach customs which it is not lawful for us, who are Romans, to receive or to observe.
044	ACT	016	022	And the multitude rose up together against them; and the magistrates stripped off their clothes, and gave command to beat them with rods.
044	ACT	016	023	And when they had laid many stripes on them, they threw them into prison, and charged the jailer to keep them securely.
044	ACT	016	024	And having received such a charge, he put them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.
044	ACT	016	025	And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sung a hymn to God; and the prisoners were listening to them.
044	ACT	016	026	And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one’s bonds were loosed.
044	ACT	016	027	And the jailer, being aroused from sleep, and seeing the doors of the prison open, drew his sword, and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had fled.
044	ACT	016	028	But Paul called out with a loud voice, saying: Do yourself no harm, for we are all here.
044	ACT	016	029	Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and trembling, he fell down before Paul and Silas;
044	ACT	016	030	and, having brought them out, he said: Sirs, what must I do to be saved?
044	ACT	016	031	They replied: Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you and your house shall be saved.
044	ACT	016	032	And they spoke the word of the Lord to him, and to all that were in his house.
044	ACT	016	033	And he took them at that hour of the night, and washed the blood from their stripes; and he was immersed, himself and all his, immediately.
044	ACT	016	034	And he brought them into his house, and set food before them, and rejoiced, believing in God, with all his house.
044	ACT	016	035	But when it was day, the magistrates sent the lictors, saying: Release those men.
044	ACT	016	036	And the jailer told these words to Paul: The magistrates have sent to release you. Now, therefore, come out, and go in peace.
044	ACT	016	037	But Paul said to them: Having publicly scourged us uncondemned, us who are Romans, they threw us into prison: and do they now put us out secretly? No, verily: but let them come and lead us out.
044	ACT	016	038	And the lictors told these words to the magistrates: and they were alarmed when they heard that they were Romans;
044	ACT	016	039	and they came, and entreated them, and led them out, and requested them to depart from the city.
044	ACT	016	040	And having come out of the prison, they went into the house of Lydia; and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and departed.
044	ACT	017	001	And when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews.
044	ACT	017	002	And Paul, according to his custom, went in to them, and, for three sabbath-days, he reasoned with them from the Scriptures,
044	ACT	017	003	explaining and affirming that it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead; and that this Jesus whom I preach to you is the Christ.
044	ACT	017	004	And some of them believed, and associated themselves with Paul and Silas; of the devout Greeks, a great multitude, and of the chief women, not a few.
044	ACT	017	005	But the unbelieving Jews, taking with them some evil men, who were loungers about the markets, and collecting a mob, set the city in an uproar; and having assaulted the house of Jason, they sought to bring them out to the people.
044	ACT	017	006	But not finding them, they dragged Jason and certain brethren before the rulers of the city, crying out: These men, who have thrown the world into confusion, have come hither also;
044	ACT	017	007	whom Jason has received into his house: and they all act in opposition to the decrees of Cæsar, saying, That there is another king, Jesus.
044	ACT	017	008	And the multitude, and the rulers of the city, were troubled when they heard these things.
044	ACT	017	009	And they took security of Jason, and of the others, and let them go.
044	ACT	017	010	And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night to Berea; and when they had come, they went into the synagogue of the Jews.
044	ACT	017	011	These were of a better disposition than those in Thessalonica, for they received the word with all readiness of mind, examining the Scriptures daily, whether these things were so.
044	ACT	017	012	Therefore, many of them believed; both of influential women, who were Greeks, and of men, not a few.
044	ACT	017	013	But when the Jews of Thessalonica learned that the word of God was preached by Paul in Berea also, they came thither, and excited the multitude.
044	ACT	017	014	Then the brethren immediately sent Paul away, to go as if to the sea; but Silas and Timothy remained there.
044	ACT	017	015	And those who conducted Paul brought him to Athens: and having received a commandment for Silas and Timothy, that they should come to him as soon as possible, they departed.
044	ACT	017	016	Now while Paul was waiting for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred within him, when he saw the city full of idols.
044	ACT	017	017	Accordingly, he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and devout persons, and in the market daily, with those who chanced to meet him.
044	ACT	017	018	And some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers disputed with him; and some said: What can this babbler possibly wish to say? Others said: He seems to be a proclaimer of strange demons: for he preached to them Jesus and the Resurrection.
044	ACT	017	019	And they took him, and brought him to Mars hill, saying: Are we able to understand what this new teaching is, which is announced by you?
044	ACT	017	020	For you bring some strange things to our ears: we wish to understand then what these things mean.
044	ACT	017	021	For all the Athenians and resident strangers have leisure for nothing else than to tell or to hear some new thing.
044	ACT	017	022	Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars hill, and said: Men of Athens, I perceive that in all respects your reverence for demons excels that of other men.
044	ACT	017	023	For as I was passing through, and looking attentively at the objects of your worship, I dis covered also an altar with this inscription: TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore you ignorantly worship, him I make known to you.
044	ACT	017	024	God, who made the world, and all things that are in it, being Lord of heaven and earth, dwells not in temples made with hands;
044	ACT	017	025	nor is he ministered to by the hands of men, as if he needed any thing: for he himself gives to all life, and breath, and all things:
044	ACT	017	026	and he has made from one blood every nation of men, that they might dwell on all the face of the earth, having marked out their appointed times, and the bounds of their dwelling:
044	ACT	017	027	that they might seek for God, if perhaps they would feel after him, and find him, although, indeed, he is not far from every one of us.
044	ACT	017	028	For in him we live, and move, and have our being: as also some of your own poets have said: For we his offspring are.
044	ACT	017	029	Therefore, being the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhood is like gold, or silver, or stone, sculptured by art and the device of man.
044	ACT	017	030	Yet the times of this ignorance God overlooked; but now, he commands all men everywhere to repent:
044	ACT	017	031	because he has appointed a day in which he will judge the world, in righteousness, by the man whom he has chosen, giving to all assurance of this, by having raised him from the dead.
044	ACT	017	032	And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked; others said: We will hear you again concerning this matter.
044	ACT	017	033	And so Paul departed from among them.
044	ACT	017	034	But certain men associated with him, and believed; among whom was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.
044	ACT	018	001	After these things, Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth;
044	ACT	018	002	and finding a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, who had lately come from Italy, with Priscilla his wife, because Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome, he went to them;
044	ACT	018	003	and because he was of the same trade, he made his home with them, and worked: for by trade they were tent-makers.
044	ACT	018	004	But on every sabbath, he reasoned in the synagogue, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.
044	ACT	018	005	And when Silas and Timothy came from Macedonia, Paul was roused in spirit, and earnestly testified to the Jews, that the Christ was Jesus.
044	ACT	018	006	But when they set themselves in opposition, and reviled, he shook his clothing, and said to them: Your blood be upon your own head; I am clean. Henceforth I will go to the Gentiles.
044	ACT	018	007	And he departed thence, and went into the house of a certain man named Justus, who worshiped God, and whose house joined the synagogue.
044	ACT	018	008	But Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord, with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing, believed, and were immersed.
044	ACT	018	009	And the Lord spoke to Paul by a vision in the night: Fear not; but speak, and be not silent;
044	ACT	018	010	for I am with you, and no one shall make an assault upon you, to injure you; for I have many people in this city.
044	ACT	018	011	And he remained there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them
044	ACT	018	012	But while Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews, with one mind, suddenly came upon Paul, and brought him to the judgment-seat,
044	ACT	018	013	saying: This man persuades men to worship God contrary to the law.
044	ACT	018	014	But when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews: If it were a matter of injustice, or of wicked mischief, O Jews, I would, with reason, bear with you:
044	ACT	018	015	but if it is a question about a word, and names, and your law, see to it yourselves: for I will not be a judge of these tilings.
044	ACT	018	016	And he drove them from the judgment-seat.
044	ACT	018	017	And all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment-seat. And Gallio cared for none of these things.
044	ACT	018	018	And Paul, having remained many days longer, took leave of the brethren, and sailed to Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila, having shorn his head in Cenchrea; for he had a vow.
044	ACT	018	019	And he came to Ephesus, and left them there; but he himself went into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.
044	ACT	018	020	And though they besought him to remain with them a longer time, he did not consent,
044	ACT	018	021	but took leave of them, saying: I must, by all means, keep this coming feast in Jerusalem: but I will return to you, if God be willing. And he sailed from Ephesus,
044	ACT	018	022	and having landed at Cæsarea, and gone up and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch.
044	ACT	018	023	And having spent some time there, he departed, and went through the region of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples.
044	ACT	018	024	And a certain Jew, named Apollos, an Alexandrian by birth, an eloquent man, and mighty in the Scriptures, came to Ephesus.
044	ACT	018	025	He was instructed in the way of the Lord; and, being fervent in spirit, he spoke and taught accurately the things of the Lord, knowing only the immersion of John.
044	ACT	018	026	And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue. But when Aquila and Priscilla heard him, they took him, and taught him the way of God more accurately.
044	ACT	018	027	And when he wished to pass into Achaia, the brethren, exhorting him, wrote to the disciples to receive him. And when he had come, he gave much help to the believers, through the grace conferred on him.
044	ACT	018	028	For, with great strength, he utterly confounded the Jews publicly, showing, by the Scriptures, that the Christ was Jesus.
044	ACT	019	001	And it came to pass, while Apollos was at Corinth, that Paul, after passing through the upper districts, came to Ephesus, and finding certain disciples,
044	ACT	019	002	said to them: Have you received the Holy Spirit since you believed? They said to him: We have not only not received it, but we have not even heard whether the Holy Spirit is given.
044	ACT	019	003	And he said to them: Into what, then, were you immersed? They replied: Into John’s immersion.
044	ACT	019	004	And Paul said: John immersed with the immersion of repentance, saying to the people, that they must believe on him who should come after him, that is, on the Christ, Jesus.
044	ACT	019	005	And when they heard this, they were immersed into the name of the Lord Jesus.
044	ACT	019	006	And when Paul laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they spoke with tongues, and prophesied.
044	ACT	019	007	And all the men were about twelve.
044	ACT	019	008	And he entered the synagogue, and spoke boldly, reasoning, and persuading them for three months, with respect to the things of the kingdom of God.
044	ACT	019	009	But as some were hardened, and did not believe, and spoke evil of that way before the multitude, he withdrew from them, and separated the disciples, and discoursed daily in the school of one Tyrannus.
044	ACT	019	010	This continued for two years; so that all that dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.
044	ACT	019	011	Mighty deeds, also, that were unusual, did God perform by the hands of Paul;
044	ACT	019	012	so that handkerchiefs or aprons were carried from his body to the sick, and diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits came out of them.
044	ACT	019	013	And some of the roving Jews, who were exorcists, undertook to pronounce the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying: I adjure you by the Jesus whom Paul preaches.
044	ACT	019	014	And there were seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, who did this.
044	ACT	019	015	But the evil spirit answered and said: Jesus I acknowledge, and Paul I know; but who are you?
044	ACT	019	016	And the man in whom the evil spirit was, leaped on them, and overpowered them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled from that house, naked and wounded.
044	ACT	019	017	And this became known to all the Greeks and Jews that dwelt in Ephesus; and fear fell upon them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.
044	ACT	019	018	And many of those who believed came and confessed, and made known their practices.
044	ACT	019	019	And many of those who practiced magic, brought together their books, and burned them, in the presence of all. And they computed their value, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.
044	ACT	019	020	So mightily did the word of the Lord grow and prevail.
044	ACT	019	021	When these things had been accomplished, Paul purposed in spirit to go to Jerusalem, after he should pass through Macedonia and Achaia, saying: After I have been there, I must see Rome also.
044	ACT	019	022	So, having sent into Macedonia two of those who ministered to him, Timothy and Erastus, he remained for a time in Asia.
044	ACT	019	023	And at that time there was no little excitement about that way.
044	ACT	019	024	For a certain man, named Demetrius, a silversmith, by making silver shrines for Diana, furnished no little trade to the artists.
044	ACT	019	025	These he called together, with the workmen employed about such things, and said: Men, you know that our wealth arises from this trade:
044	ACT	019	026	and you see and hear, that not only at Ephesus, but throughout almost the whole of Asia, this Paul, by his persuasions, has drawn away a great multitude, saying, that they which are made with hands are not gods.
044	ACT	019	027	Now there is danger, not only that this our calling will come into disgrace, but that the temple of the great goddess Diana will be despised, and that the majesty of her whom all Asia and the world worships, will be destroyed.
044	ACT	019	028	When they heard this, they were full of anger, and cried out, saying: Great is Diana of the Ephesians!
044	ACT	019	029	And the whole city was filled with confusion. And they seized Gains and Aristarchus, who were Macedonians, Paul’s fellow-travelers, and, with one consent, rushed into the theater.
044	ACT	019	030	And when Paul wished to go in among the people, the disciples did not permit him.
044	ACT	019	031	Some of the Asiarchs also, who were friendly to him, sent to him, and besought him not to trust himself into the theater.
044	ACT	019	032	Some, therefore, were crying one thing, and some another: for the assembly was confused, and the greater part knew not for what they had come together.
044	ACT	019	033	And some of the multitude put Alexander forward, the Jews urging him on. And Alexander waved his hand, and wished to make a defense to the people.
044	ACT	019	034	But perceiving that he was a Jew, they all cried out, with one voice, for about two hours: Great is Diana of the Ephesians.
044	ACT	019	035	But the town-clerk quieted the multitude, and said: Men of Ephesus, what man is there who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is a worshiper of the great Diana, and of the image that fell down from Jupiter?
044	ACT	019	036	As these things, then, can not be contradicted, you ought to be quiet, and do nothing rashly.
044	ACT	019	037	For you have brought these men here, who are neither robbers of temples, nor revilers of your goddess.
044	ACT	019	038	Therefore, if Demetrius, and the artists who are with him, have a charge against any one, the courts are in session, and the proconsuls are there; let them accuse each other.
044	ACT	019	039	But if you have any inquiries to make about other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly.
044	ACT	019	040	For we are in danger of being called to answer for this day’s tumult, since there is no cause by which we shall be able to account for this concourse.
044	ACT	019	041	And when he had said these things, he dismissed the assembly.
044	ACT	020	001	After the tumult had ceased, Paul called the disciples to him, and bade them farewell, and departed, in order to go into Macedonia.
044	ACT	020	002	And when he had gone through those regions, and had exhorted them with many words, he came into Greece.
044	ACT	020	003	And having remained there three months, he determined to return through Macedonia, because a plot had been laid for him by the Jews, as he was about to sail to Syria.
044	ACT	020	004	And Sopater of Berea, and Aristarchus and Secundus of Thessalonica, and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy and Tychicus and Trophimus, who were Asiatics, accompanied him to Asia.
044	ACT	020	005	These went before, and waited for us at Troas.
044	ACT	020	006	But we sailed from Philippi, after the days of unleavened bread, and came to them at Troas in five days, where we remained seven days.
044	ACT	020	007	And on the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul discoursed to them, intending to depart on the morrow; and he continued his speech till midnight.
044	ACT	020	008	And there were many lamps in the upper room, in which they had met together.
044	ACT	020	009	And a certain young man, named Eutychus, was sitting in the window, overpowered with deep sleep: and, as Paul was discoursing a long time, being oppressed with sleep, he fell from the third story, and was taken up dead.
044	ACT	020	010	But Paul went down, and fell upon him, and embracing him, said: Be not troubled, for his life is in him.
044	ACT	020	011	And he went up again, and broke bread, and ate; and having conversed a long time, till daylight, he thus departed.
044	ACT	020	012	And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little comforted.
044	ACT	020	013	And we went on before to the ship, and put to sea for Assos, intending to take Paul on board at that place; for he had so directed, intending to go himself on foot.
044	ACT	020	014	And when he met us at Assos, we took him on board, and came to Mitylene;
044	ACT	020	015	and sailing from that place, we came, on the following day, opposite to Chios; and, on the next day, we arrived at Samos: and after stopping at Trogyllium, we came, on the next day, to Miletus.
044	ACT	020	016	For Paul had determined to sail past Ephesus, that he might not spend time in Asia; for he hastened, that, if it were possible for him, he might be in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost.
044	ACT	020	017	From Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church.
044	ACT	020	018	And when they had come to him, he said to them: You know, from the first day on which I came into Asia, how I have been with you during the whole time,
044	ACT	020	019	serving the Lord with all lowliness of mind, and with tears, and with trials, which came upon me through the plots of the Jews;
044	ACT	020	020	and that I have kept back nothing that was profitable, but have preached to you, and taught you both publicly, and from house to house,
044	ACT	020	021	bearing full testimony both to Jews and to Greeks, of the repentance that leads to God, and of the faith that leads to our Lord Jesus Christ.
044	ACT	020	022	And now, behold, I am going, bound in spirit, to Jerusalem, not knowing what shall befall me there,
044	ACT	020	023	except that in every city the Holy Spirit testifies to me, saying, That bonds and afflictions await me.
044	ACT	020	024	But I esteem this a matter of no importance, nor do I hold my life dear to myself, so that I may finish my course with joy, and the ministry that I have received from the Lord Jesus, to bear full testimony to the gospel of the grace of God.
044	ACT	020	025	And now, behold, I know that you all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, will see my face no more.
044	ACT	020	026	For this reason I solemnly affirm to you this day, that I am clean from the blood of all men.
044	ACT	020	027	For I have not shunned to declare to you the whole counsel of God.
044	ACT	020	028	Therefore, take heed to yourselves, and to all the flock over which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, that you be shepherds to the church of God, which he has purchased with his own blood.
044	ACT	020	029	For I know this, that, after my departure, rapacious wolves will enter in among you, who will not spare the flock;
044	ACT	020	030	and men will arise from among yourselves, speaking perverse things, that they may draw off disciples after them.
044	ACT	020	031	Therefore watch, remembering that for three years, by day and by night, I ceased not to warn every one of you with tears.
044	ACT	020	032	And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace; to Him who is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all the sanctified.
044	ACT	020	033	I have coveted no man’s silver, or gold, or apparel.
044	ACT	020	034	You yourselves know that these hands have ministered to my necessities, and to those who were with me.
044	ACT	020	035	In all things I have taught you by example, that by thus laboring, you ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus; for he himself said, It is more blessed to give, than to receive.
044	ACT	020	036	And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down and prayed with them all.
044	ACT	020	037	And they all wept much, and fell on Paul’s neck, and kissed him,
044	ACT	020	038	grieving most of all for the word he had spoken, that they would see his face no more. And they conducted him to the ship.
044	ACT	021	001	And it came to pass that, after we had separated from them, we put to sea, and came by a straight course to Cos, and on the following day, to Rhodes, and thence to Patara.
044	ACT	021	002	And finding a ship that was going to Phenicia, we embarked, and put to sea.
044	ACT	021	003	And we came in view of Cyprus; and, leaving it to the left, we sailed to Syria, and landed at Tyre: for there the ship was to put off her lading.
044	ACT	021	004	And we remained there seven days, after finding the disciples. These urged Paul, by the Spirit, not to go up to Jerusalem.
044	ACT	021	005	And when these days were completed, we went forth, and continued our journey, they all, with their wives and children, conducting us out of the city: and we kneeled down on the shore, and prayed.
044	ACT	021	006	And when we had bid each other farewell, we embarked, and they returned home.
044	ACT	021	007	And completing the voyage from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolemais: and having saluted the brethren, we remained with them one day.
044	ACT	021	008	On the following day we departed, and came to Cæsarea, and went into the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven; and we remained with him.
044	ACT	021	009	This man had four virgin daughters, who had the gift of prophesy.
044	ACT	021	010	And as we remained there many days, there came down, from Judea, a certain prophet, named Agabus;
044	ACT	021	011	and he came to us, and taking Paul’s girdle, he bound his own hands and feet, and said: Thus says the Holy Spirit; the Jews that are in Jerusalem will so bind the man to whom this girdle belongs; and they will deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.
044	ACT	021	012	And when we heard these things, we, and those of that place also, besought him not to go up to Jerusalem.
044	ACT	021	013	But Paul answered: What do you effect by weeping, and breaking my heart? For I am ready, not only to be bound, but also to suffer death in Jerusalem, for the name of the Lord Jesus.
044	ACT	021	014	And as he would not be persuaded, we kept silence, and said: The will of the Lord be done.
044	ACT	021	015	And after these days we prepared for our journey, and went up to Jerusalem.
044	ACT	021	016	There went with us also some of the disciples from Cæsarea, who took with them, Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple, with whom we should lodge.
044	ACT	021	017	And when we came to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly.
044	ACT	021	018	And, on the following day, Paul went in with us to James, and all the elders were present.
044	ACT	021	019	And when he had saluted them, he related, in every particular, the things which. God had done among the Gentiles by his ministry.
044	ACT	021	020	And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord, and said to him: You see, brother, how many myriads of the Jews there are that believe, and they are all zealous for the law.
044	ACT	021	021	And they have heard it reported of you, that you teach all the Jews that are among the Gentiles to apostatize from Moses; commanding them not to circumcise their children, nor to walk according to the customs.
044	ACT	021	022	What, then, is to be done? A multitude must certainly come together; for they will hear that you have come.
044	ACT	021	023	Do, therefore, this which we advise you. We have four men who have a vow on them.
044	ACT	021	024	Take them, and join with them in their vow of abstinence, and pay their expenses, in order that they may shave their heads; and all will know that the things which they have heard reported of you are nothing; but that you yourself also walk orderly, and keep the law.
044	ACT	021	025	But with respect to the Gentiles that believe, we have written; having decided that they should observe no such thing; but that they keep themselves from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what is strangled, and from lewdness.
044	ACT	021	026	Then Paul took the men, and, on the following day, joining in their vow of abstinence, he entered the temple, and gave notice when the days of abstinence would be completed, at which time an offering should be made for each of them.
044	ACT	021	027	And when the seven days were about to be completed, the Jews from Asia, seeing him in the temple, threw all the multitude into confusion, and laid their hands on him,
044	ACT	021	028	crying out: Men of Israel, help! this is the man who teaches all men every where against this people, and the law, and this place: and besides, he has even brought Greeks into the temple, and defiled this holy place.
044	ACT	021	029	For, before this time, they had seen Trophimus, the Ephesian, with him in the city, whom they supposed Paul had brought into the temple.
044	ACT	021	030	And the whole city was moved; and the people ran together, and, seizing Paul, they dragged him out of the temple, and the gates were immediately closed.
044	ACT	021	031	And while they were seeking to kill him, report was brought to the officer of the band, that the whole of Jerusalem was in an uproar.
044	ACT	021	032	And he immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down to them. When they saw the officer and the soldiers, they ceased beating Paul.
044	ACT	021	033	Then the officer came near and took him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains, and demanded who he was, and what he had done.
044	ACT	021	034	And some in the multitude cried out one thing, and some another. But not being able to obtain any certain knowledge on account of the tumult, he commanded him to be led into the fortress.
044	ACT	021	035	And when he was on the steps, it happened that he was carried by the soldiers, on account of the violence of the multitude.
044	ACT	021	036	For the greater part of the people followed, crying out: Away with him!
044	ACT	021	037	But as Paul was about to be led into the fortress, he said to the officer: May I speak to you? He replied: Do you understand Greek?
044	ACT	021	038	Are you not that Egyptian, who, before these days, made an insurrection, and led out into the wilderness four thousand men of the Assassins?
044	ACT	021	039	But Paul replied: I am a Jew of Tarsus of Cilicia, a citizen of no unknown city; and I beseech you, permit me to speak to the people.
044	ACT	021	040	And when he had given him permission, Paul, standing upon the steps, waved his hand to the people. And when there was great silence, he addressed them in the Hebrew language, saying:
044	ACT	022	001	Brethren and fathers, hear my defense, which I now make before you.
044	ACT	022	002	When they heard that he spoke to them in the Hebrew language, they kept the greater silence. And he said:
044	ACT	022	003	I am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, yet educated in this city, at the feet of Gamaliel, and instructed according to the strict discipline of the law of our fathers, being zealous for God, as you all are this day.
044	ACT	022	004	And I persecuted this way to the death, binding and delivering into prison both men and women,
044	ACT	022	005	as the chief priest and the whole body of elders will testify for me. From them I also received letters to the brethren, and went to Damascus, to bring those, also, who were there, bound to Jerusalem, that they might be punished.
044	ACT	022	006	But it came to pass, that, as I was on my journey, and was drawing near to Damascus, about midday, there suddenly shone from heaven a great light round about me;
044	ACT	022	007	and I fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to me, Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?
044	ACT	022	008	And I answered, Who art thou Lord? And he said to me, I am Jesus the Nazarene, whom you persecute.
044	ACT	022	009	They who were with me saw the light, and were afraid, but did not understand the voice of him who spoke to me.
044	ACT	022	010	And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said to me, Arise, and go into Damascus, and there you shall be told of all things that are appointed for you to do.
044	ACT	022	011	And as I could not see for the glory of that light, I was led by the hand by those who were with me, and went into Damascus.
044	ACT	022	012	And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, who had a good report from all the Jews that dwelt there,
044	ACT	022	013	came to me, and standing by me, said, Brother Saul, receive your sight. And the same hour I looked upon him.
044	ACT	022	014	And he said, The God of our fathers has chosen you, that you should know his will, and see the Just One, and hear the voice of his mouth;
044	ACT	022	015	for you shall be his witness to all men of what you have seen and heard.
044	ACT	022	016	And now, why do you delay? Arise, and be immersed, and wash away your sins, calling on the name of the Lord.
044	ACT	022	017	And it came to pass, after I had returned to Jerusalem, and while I was praying in the temple, that I was in a trance,
044	ACT	022	018	and saw him saying to me, Make haste, and depart quickly from Jerusalem, for they will not receive your testimony concerning me.
044	ACT	022	019	And I said, Lord, they themselves know that I threw into prison, and scourged, in every synagogue, those who believed on thee;
044	ACT	022	020	and that when the blood of Stephen, thy witness, was shed, I also stood by and approved, and kept the clothing of those who slew him.
044	ACT	022	021	And he said to me, Depart, for I will send you far off to the Gentiles.
044	ACT	022	022	And they heard him to this word, and lifted up their voice, saying: Away with such a man from the earth! for it is not fit that he should live.
044	ACT	022	023	And as they were crying out, and tossing off their clothes, and throwing dust into the air,
044	ACT	022	024	the officer commanded him to be led into the fortress, and gave orders that he should be examined by scourging, that he might know for what cause they so cried out against him.
044	ACT	022	025	But Paul said to the centurion who stood by, as he caused him to be bent forward to the straps: Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman, and uncondemned?
044	ACT	022	026	And when the centurion heard that, he went out and told it to the officer, saying: What are you about to do? for this man is a Roman.
044	ACT	022	027	And the officer came and said to him: Tell me, are you a Roman? He answered: Yes.
044	ACT	022	028	And the officer answered: With a great Bum did I purchase this citizenship. And Paul replied: But I was born a citizen.
044	ACT	022	029	Then, those who were about to examine him, immediately departed from him. And the officer was afraid, when he learned that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.
044	ACT	022	030	And, on the next day, wishing to know certainly why he was accused by the Jews, he loosed him, and commanded the chief priests and all the Sanhedrim to meet together. And he brought Paul down, and placed him before them.
044	ACT	023	001	And Paul, looking earnestly upon the Sanhedrim, said: Brethren, I have lived in all good conscience toward God to this day.
044	ACT	023	002	And the chief priest, Ananias, commanded those who stood by to smite him on the mouth.
044	ACT	023	003	Then Paul said to him: God will smite you, you whitened wall! for do you sit to judge me according to the law, and yet violate the law by commanding me to be smitten?
044	ACT	023	004	And those who stood by said: Do you revile God’s chief priest?
044	ACT	023	005	And Paul replied: I did not know, brethren, that he was the chief priest: for it is written, You shall not speak evil of the ruler of your people.
044	ACT	023	006	But when Paul perceived that one part belonged to the Sadducees, and the other to the Pharisees, he cried out, in the Sanhedrim: Brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee; for the hope of the resurrection of the dead am I judged.
044	ACT	023	007	And when he had said this, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the multitude was divided.
044	ACT	023	008	For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection; neither angel nor spirit: but the Pharisees acknowledge both. And there arose a great clamor. And the scribes, on the part of the Pharisees, arose and contended, saying:
044	ACT	023	009	We find no evil in this man; but if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him, let us not fight against God.
044	ACT	023	010	And when there arose a great dissension, the officer, fearing that Paul would be torn to pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among them, and to bring him into the fortress.
044	ACT	023	011	And on the following night, the Lord stood by him, and said: Take courage; for as you have testified of me in Jerusalem, so must you testify also in Rome.
044	ACT	023	012	And when it was day, the Jews combined together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying, that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.
044	ACT	023	013	And there were more than forty who formed this conspiracy.
044	ACT	023	014	And they went to the chief priests and elders, and said: We have surely bound ourselves under a curse, that we will taste nothing till we have killed Paul.
044	ACT	023	015	Now, therefore, do you, together with the Sanhedrim, give notice to the officer, that he bring him down to you to-morrow, as if you intended to inquire more accurately into the matters concerning him: and before he comes near, we are ready to kill him.
044	ACT	023	016	But the son of Paul’s sister heard of the plot, and he went and entered the fortress, and told Paul.
044	ACT	023	017	And Paul called one of the centurions to him, and said: Conduct this young man to the officer, for he has something to tell him.
044	ACT	023	018	So he took him, and led him to the officer, and said: The prisoner Paul called me to him, and requested me to conduct this young man to you; for he has something to tell you.
044	ACT	023	019	And the officer took him by the hand, and went aside with him privately, and inquired: What is it that you have to tell me?
044	ACT	023	020	He answered: The Jews have agreed to request you to bring Paul down into the Sanhedrim to-morrow, as if they intended to inquire something more accurately concerning him.
044	ACT	023	021	Do not, however, be persuaded by them; for more than forty men of them are lying in wait for him; and they have bound themselves under a curse, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him. And now they are ready, waiting for a promise from you.
044	ACT	023	022	Then the officer sent the young man away, with this charge: Tell no one that you have made these things known to me.
044	ACT	023	023	And he called to him two centurions, and said: Make ready two hundred soldiers, and seventy horsemen, and two hundred spearmen, that they may depart to Cæsarea at the third hour of the night.
044	ACT	023	024	And provide beasts on which they may set Paul, and take him in safety to Felix the governor.
044	ACT	023	025	And he wrote a letter in this form:
044	ACT	023	026	Claudius Lysias to the most excellent governor, Felix, greeting:
044	ACT	023	027	This man was taken by the Jews, and was about to be killed by them. Then I went with soldiers, and rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman.
044	ACT	023	028	But wishing to know the cause for which they accused him, I brought him down into their Sanhedrim.
044	ACT	023	029	And I found that he was accused about questions of their law, but had nothing worthy of death or of bonds charged against him.
044	ACT	023	030	And as I was informed that a plot was about to be laid against the man by the Jews, I immediately sent him to you, and commanded his accusers to say in your presence what they had against him. Farewell.
044	ACT	023	031	Then the soldiers took Paul, as they were commanded, and brought him by night to Antipatris.
044	ACT	023	032	And, on the morrow, they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the fortress.
044	ACT	023	033	When they came to Cæsarea, and delivered the letter to the governor, they presented Paul also before him.
044	ACT	023	034	And when he had read the letter, he inquired to what province he belonged. And learning that he was from Cilicia,
044	ACT	023	035	he said: I will hear you when your accusers also have come. And he ordered him to be kept under guard in Herod’s palace.
044	ACT	024	001	And after five days, Ananias the chief priest came down with the elders and a certain orator, Tertullus; and they informed the governor against Paul.
044	ACT	024	002	And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying:
044	ACT	024	003	Since through you we enjoy great quietness, and since whatever has been undertaken for this nation has been conducted to a successful issue by your foresight at all times and in all places, we accept it, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness.
044	ACT	024	004	But that I may not detain you longer, I beseech you to hear us, in your clemency, a few words.
044	ACT	024	005	For we have found this man a pest and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.
044	ACT	024	006	He also attempted to profane the temple; and we took him, and wished to judge him according to our law.
044	ACT	024	007	But Lysias the officer came, and, with much violence, took him out of our hands,
044	ACT	024	008	and commanded his accusers to come before you. From him you may be able yourself, by examination, to gain a knowledge of all these tilings of which we accuse him.
044	ACT	024	009	And the Jews united in accusing him, saying that these things were so.
044	ACT	024	010	Then Paul, after the governor had nodded to him to speak, answered: Knowing that you have been for many years a judge of this nation, I do the more cheerfully offer a defense for myself:
044	ACT	024	011	for you can understand that there are not more than twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem to worship.
044	ACT	024	012	And they found me neither disputing with any one in the temple, nor exciting the multitude in the synagogue, or in the city:
044	ACT	024	013	nor are they able to prove the things of which they now accuse me.
044	ACT	024	014	But this I confess to you, that after the way which they call sect, so do I worship the God of my fathers; believing all things that are written in the law and in the prophets;
044	ACT	024	015	having hope in God, which they themselves also admit, that I there will be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and of the unjust.
044	ACT	024	016	And I do exercise myself in this, always to have a conscience void of offense toward God and man.
044	ACT	024	017	But, after many years, I came to bring charitable gifts to my nation, and offerings.
044	ACT	024	018	While engaged in these things, certain Jews from Asia found me fulfilling my vow of abstinence in the temple, not with a multitude, nor with tumult.
044	ACT	024	019	These ought to be here before you, and bring their charge, if they have any, against me.
044	ACT	024	020	Or let these persons here say, what offensive conduct they found in me when I stood before the Sanhedrim,
044	ACT	024	021	except in this one expression, which I uttered while standing among them: With respect to the resurrection I of the dead, I am judged by you this day.
044	ACT	024	022	But Felix, having a more accurate knowledge of this way, put them off, and said: When Lysias the officer comes down, I will inquire fully into your matters.
044	ACT	024	023	And he commanded the centurion to keep him under guard, and to relax the rigor of his confinement, and to forbid no one of his friends to minister or to come to him.
044	ACT	024	024	And, after some days, Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was a Jewess; and he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.
044	ACT	024	025	And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and the judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered: For the present withdraw; when I have a convenient season, I will call for you.
044	ACT	024	026	He hoped, at the same time, that money would have been given him by Paul, to release him. For this reason, he sent for him very frequently, and conversed with him.
044	ACT	024	027	But, after two years, Felix received Portius Festus as his successor; and Felix, wishing to confer a favor on the Jews, left Paul bound.
044	ACT	025	001	When Festus, having entered upon his government, after three days went up from Cæsarea to Jerusalem.
044	ACT	025	002	And the chief priest and first men of the Jews informed him against Paul,
044	ACT	025	003	and, asking a favor against him, besought him that he would send and have him brought to Jerusalem, laying a plot to kill him on the road.
044	ACT	025	004	Then Festus answered, that Paul was under guard in Cæsarea, and that he himself would soon depart thither.
044	ACT	025	005	Therefore, said he, let those among you who are men of influence, go down with me, and accuse this man, if there is any wickedness in him.
044	ACT	025	006	And he remained among them not more than eight or ten days, and then went down to Cæsarea And, on the next day, he sat upon the judgment-seat, and commanded Paul to be brought.
044	ACT	025	007	And when he had come, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around, and brought many and heavy accusations against Paul, which they were not able to prove,
044	ACT	025	008	he answering for himself: Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Cæsar, have I committed any offense.
044	ACT	025	009	But Festus, willing to confer a favor on the Jews, answered Paul, and said: Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged before me concerning these things?
044	ACT	025	010	And Paul answered: I am standing at the judgment-seat of Cæsar, where I ought to be judged. To the Jews I have done no wrong, as you very well know.
044	ACT	025	011	If, however, I be an offender, and have done any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die. But if the things of which these men accuse me are nothing, no one can deliver me to them. I appeal to Cæsar.
044	ACT	025	012	Then Festus, after conferring with the council, answered: To Cæsar have you appealed? To Cæsar you shall go.
044	ACT	025	013	And after some days, King Agrippa and Bernice came down to Cæsarea, to salute Festus.
044	ACT	025	014	And as they remained there many days, Festus made known to the king the facts concerning Paul, saying: There is a certain man, who was left in bonds by Felix,
044	ACT	025	015	concerning whom, when I was in Jerusalem, the chief priests and elders of the Jews informed me, asking for judgment against him.
044	ACT	025	016	I replied to them, that it is not the custom of the Romans to deliver any man up to death, before the accused has had his accusers face to face, and has had an opportunity to answer concerning the charge that is against him.
044	ACT	025	017	Therefore, when they had come hither with me, I made no delay; but, on the next day, sat on the judgment-seat, and commanded the man to be brought forth.
044	ACT	025	018	And when his accusers stood up, they brought no such charge against him as I expected;
044	ACT	025	019	but they had certain questions against him, about their own religion, and about a certain Jesus that had died, who, Paul affirmed, was alive.
044	ACT	025	020	But, being in doubt about the question concerning this man, I asked him if he would go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged with respect to these matters.
044	ACT	025	021	But when Paul made his appeal, that he should be kept for the judgment of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept, till I could send him to Cæsar
044	ACT	025	022	And Agrippa said to Festus: I could wish to have heard the man myself. He replied: To-morrow you shall hear him.
044	ACT	025	023	Therefore, on the morrow, when Agrippa and Bernice came with great pomp, and entered the place of audience, with the officers and principal men of the city, Paul, at the command of Festus, was brought forth.
044	ACT	025	024	And Festus said: King Agrippa, and all men here present, you see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews, both in Jerusalem and in this place, have entreated me, crying out, that he ought to live no longer.
044	ACT	025	025	But finding that he had done nothing worthy of death, and as he himself has appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him.
044	ACT	025	026	Concerning him I have nothing certain to write to my Lord. For this reason, I have brought him before you all, and especially before you, King Agrippa, that, after the examination has been held, I may have something to write.
044	ACT	025	027	For it seems to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not to make known the charges that are against him.
044	ACT	026	001	Then Agrippa said to Paul: You are permitted to speak for yourself. Then Paul stretched forth his hand, and answered for himself.
044	ACT	026	002	I think myself happy, King Agrippa, because I shall this day make my defense before you, concerning all things of which I am accused by the Jews;
044	ACT	026	003	especially, since you are acquainted with all the customs and questions that are among the Jews. For this reason, I beseech you to hear me patiently.
044	ACT	026	004	My course of life from my youth, which, from the beginning, was among my own nation in Jerusalem, know all the Jews;
044	ACT	026	005	who, knowing me from the first, could testify, if they would, that, according to the strictest sect of our religion, I lived a Pharisee.
044	ACT	026	006	And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made by God to our fathers;
044	ACT	026	007	to which promise our twelve tribes, zealously serving night and day, hope to come: on account of which hope, King Agrippa, I am accused by the Jews.
044	ACT	026	008	What? Is it thought a thing incredible among you, that God raises the dead?
044	ACT	026	009	I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things against the name of Jesus the Nazarene.
044	ACT	026	010	And this I did in Jerusalem; and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests: and when they were put to death, I gave my vote against them.
044	ACT	026	011	And I punished them often in every synagogue, and compelled them to speak impiously; and, being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even to foreign cities.
044	ACT	026	012	While I was engaged in these things, and was going to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests,
044	ACT	026	013	at midday, while I was on the road, I saw, O King, a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and those who journeyed with me.
044	ACT	026	014	And when we had all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking to me, and saying, in the Hebrew language, Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.
044	ACT	026	015	And I said, Who art thou, Lord? He replied, I am Jesus, whom you persecute.
044	ACT	026	016	But arise, and stand upon your feet; for I have appeared to you for this purpose, to make you a minister and a witness of the things which you have seen, and of those in which I will appear to you,
044	ACT	026	017	delivering you from the people, and from the Gentiles, to whom now I send you,
044	ACT	026	018	in order to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the authority of Satan to God, that they may receive remission of sins, and an inheritance among the sanctified, by faith in me.
044	ACT	026	019	Wherefore, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision;
044	ACT	026	020	but announced first to those in Damascus and Jerusalem, and throughout all the region of Judea, and then to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works worthy of repentance.
044	ACT	026	021	For these reasons the Jews seized me in the temple, and endeavored to kill me.
044	ACT	026	022	Having, therefore, obtained help from God, I have stood till this day, testifying both to small and to great, saying nothing else than the things which the prophets and Moses did say should come to pass:
044	ACT	026	023	that Christ should suffer, and that he first, by his resurrection from the dead, should show light to the people, and to the Gentiles.
044	ACT	026	024	And as he spoke these things in his defense, Festus said, with a loud voice; Paul, you are mad; much learning drives you to madness.
044	ACT	026	025	But he replied: I am not mad, most excellent Festus, but speak forth the words of truth and soberness.
044	ACT	026	026	For the king has knowledge of these things, before whom, also, I speak with boldness; for I am persuaded that none of these things have escaped his notice; for this was not done in a corner.
044	ACT	026	027	King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe.
044	ACT	026	028	Then Agrippa said to Paul: You almost persuade me to be a Christian.
044	ACT	026	029	And Paul replied: I could pray to God, that not only you, but also all that hear me to-day, were both almost and altogether such as I am, except these bonds.
044	ACT	026	030	And the king arose, and the governor, and Bernice, and those who sat with them.
044	ACT	026	031	And when they had withdrawn, they conversed with one another, saying: This man does nothing worthy of death or of bonds.
044	ACT	026	032	And Agrippa said to Festus: This man could have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed to Cæsar
044	ACT	027	001	And as it was determined that we should sail to Italy, they delivered Paul and some other prisoners to a centurion of the Augustan band, named Julius.
044	ACT	027	002	And going on board a ship of Adramyttium, we put to sea, intending to sail by the coast of Asia, Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.
044	ACT	027	003	On the next day, we touched at Sidon; and Julius treated Paul with kindness, and permitted him to go to his friends, and receive their attentions.
044	ACT	027	004	And thence we put to sea, and sailed under the lee of Cyprus, because the winds were adverse.
044	ACT	027	005	And when we had sailed across the sea opposite Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia.
044	ACT	027	006	And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria, sailing to Italy; and he put us on board.
044	ACT	027	007	For many days we sailed slowly; and having with difficulty come off Cnidus, the wind not permitting us to go further, we sailed under the lee of Crete, off Salmone:
044	ACT	027	008	and coasting along it with difficulty, we came to a place called Fair Havens, near which is the city of Lasea.
044	ACT	027	009	But, after much time had been spent, and sailing was now dangerous, for the fast was already past, Paul admonished them,
044	ACT	027	010	saying: Men, I perceive that this voyage will be with damage and much loss, not only to the cargo and the ship, but also to our lives.
044	ACT	027	011	But the centurion had more confidence in the pilot, and in the owner of the ship, than in the things which were spoken by Paul.
044	ACT	027	012	And as the harbor was not commodious to winter in, the majority advised that they should put to sea from that place also, if, by any means, they might reach Phoenix, and winter there, which is a harbor of Crete, lying toward the south-west and north-west.
044	ACT	027	013	And when the south wind blew gently, supposing that they had gained their object, they launched the ship, and ran along close to the shore of Crete.
044	ACT	027	014	But in a little time a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon, blew against it.
044	ACT	027	015	And the ship being caught and unable to bear up against the wind, we committed it to the gale, and were driven along.
044	ACT	027	016	And running under the lee of a certain island called Clauda, we with difficulty secured the boat.
044	ACT	027	017	When they had taken it up, they used helps, undergirding the ship. And fearing lest they should fall into the quicksand, they lowered the mast, and thus were driven along.
044	ACT	027	018	And as we were greatly tossed by the tempest, on the next day they threw overboard the cargo;
044	ACT	027	019	and on the third day, with our own hands, we threw out the tackling of the ship.
044	ACT	027	020	And as neither sun nor stars appeared for many days, and no small tempest lay upon us, all hope of our being saved was at length taken away.
044	ACT	027	021	But, after long abstinence from food, Paul stood up in the midst of them, and said: men, you ought to have been persuaded by me, and not to have put to sea from Crete; and you would have avoided this damage and loss.
044	ACT	027	022	And now, I exhort you to be of good cheer; for there shall be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship.
044	ACT	027	023	For there stood by me this night an angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve,
044	ACT	027	024	and said, Fear not, Paul; you must stand in the presence of Cæsar; and behold, God has given you all that are sailing with you.
044	ACT	027	025	For this reason, men, be cheerful; for I believe God, that it shall be even as it was told to me.
044	ACT	027	026	But we must be thrown upon a certain island.
044	ACT	027	027	But when the fourteenth night had come, and we were drifting up and down in the Adriatic Sea, about midnight the sailors supposed that they were drawing near some land.
044	ACT	027	028	And they sounded, and found twenty fathoms: and when they had gone a little further, and sounded again, they found fifteen fathoms.
044	ACT	027	029	And fearing that we would fall upon rocks, they threw out four anchors from the stern, and wished for day.
044	ACT	027	030	And as the sailors were attempting to flee from the ship, and were letting down the boat into the sea, under the pretext that they were about to let down anchors from the prow,
044	ACT	027	031	Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers: Unless these remain in the ship, you can not be saved.
044	ACT	027	032	Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the boat, and let it fall off.
044	ACT	027	033	And while the day was coming on, Paul exhorted them all to take food, saying: This is the fourteenth day that you have been in suspense, and continued without food, having taken nothing.
044	ACT	027	034	Wherefore, I exhort you to take food; for this will promote your safety. For not a hair shall fall from the head of any of you.
044	ACT	027	035	And when he had said this, he took bread, and gave thanks to God before them all, and broke, and began to eat.
044	ACT	027	036	And all became cheerful, and also partook of food.
044	ACT	027	037	And all of us that were in the ship were two hundred and seventy-six souls.
044	ACT	027	038	When they were satisfied with food, they lightened the ship by throwing the provisions into the sea.
044	ACT	027	039	And when it was day, they did not recognize the land; but they perceived an inlet, that had an accessible shore, into which they desired, if they could, to thrust the ship.
044	ACT	027	040	And, after cutting away the anchors, they committed the ship to the sea, at the same time loosing the lashings of the rudders: and they set up the front sail to the wind, and kept the ship firmly toward the shore.
044	ACT	027	041	And falling into a place where two currents met, they ran the ship aground, and the prow stuck fast, and remained immovable; but the stern was broken by the violence of the waves.
044	ACT	027	042	The soldiers counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest some of them should swim out and escape.
044	ACT	027	043	But the centurion, wishing to save Paul, kept them from their purpose, and commanded those who were able to swim, to throw themselves into the sea first, and get to land;
044	ACT	027	044	and then the rest, some on planks, and others on what could be taken from the ship. And thus it came to pass, that all got safe to land.
044	ACT	028	001	And when they had saved themselves, they then learned that the island was called Melita.
044	ACT	028	002	And the barbarians showed us no ordinary kindness; for they kindled a fire, and received us all, because of the rain which was falling, and because of the cold.
044	ACT	028	003	And when Paul had brought together a heap of brushwood, and laid it on the fire, a viper came out, by reason of the heat, and fastened itself on his hand.
044	ACT	028	004	And when the barbarians saw the reptile hanging from his hand, they said to one another: This man is certainly a murderer, whom, although he has saved himself from the sea, justice does not permit to live.
044	ACT	028	005	Then he shook the reptile from him into the fire, and suffered no harm.
044	ACT	028	006	But they were expecting that he would become inflamed and swollen, or would suddenly fall down dead; yet, after expecting it for a long time, and seeing no harm befall him, they changed their mind, and said he was a god.
044	ACT	028	007	Among the estates about that place were those of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius, who took us to his house, and, for three days, entertained us kindly.
044	ACT	028	008	And it happened that the father of Publius was lying sick with fever and dysentery. And Paul went in to him, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and restored him to health.
044	ACT	028	009	Therefore, after this had been clone, the rest also in the island who had diseases, came and were cured.
044	ACT	028	010	And they also honored us with many honors; and, when we put to sea, they supplied us with such things as we needed.
044	ACT	028	011	After three months we put to sea in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the island, whose sign was the Dioscuri.
044	ACT	028	012	And we landed at Syracuse, and remained there three days:
044	ACT	028	013	from which place, by coasting about, we came to Rhegium; and one day afterward, the south wind arose; and we came, on the next day, to Puteoli,
044	ACT	028	014	where we found brethren, and were persuaded to remain with them seven days. And thus we went toward Home.
044	ACT	028	015	And from this place, the brethren, having heard of us, came out as far as Appii Forum and the Three Taverns, to meet us. When Paul saw the brethren, he thanked God, and took courage.
044	ACT	028	016	When we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard; but Paul was permitted to dwell by himself, with a soldier that guarded him.
044	ACT	028	017	And it came to pass, after three days, that he called together the chief men of the Jews; and when they had come, he said to them: Brethren, though I have done nothing against the people, or the customs of our fathers, yet I was delivered as a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.
044	ACT	028	018	They, after examination, would have released me, for they found no cause of death in me.
044	ACT	028	019	But because the Jews spoke against it, I was compelled to appeal to Cæsar: not that I have any accusation to bring against my own nation.
044	ACT	028	020	For this reason, I called for you, that I might see you and speak to you; for on account of the hope of Israel, I am bound with this chain.
044	ACT	028	021	And they said to him: We have neither received letters from Judea concerning you, nor has any one of the brethren come, and reported or spoken any evil of you.
044	ACT	028	022	But we think it right to hear from you what you think: for, as it respects this sect, we know that it is everywhere spoken against.
044	ACT	028	023	And when they had appointed him a day, many came to him at his lodging; to whom, from morning till evening; , he earnestly testified, and set forth the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both from the law of Moses, and from the prophets.
044	ACT	028	024	And some believed the things that were spoken, and some believed not.
044	ACT	028	025	And not agreeing among themselves, they departed, after Paul had spoken one word: Well did the Holy Spirit speak to our fathers by Isaiah the prophet,
044	ACT	028	026	saying: Go to this people and say, You shall surely hear, but you will not understand; and you shall surely see, but you will not perceive.
044	ACT	028	027	For the heart of this people has become fat, and with their ears they hear heavily, and their eyes they have closed, lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should turn, and I should restore them to health.
044	ACT	028	028	Therefore, be it known to you, that the salvation of God is sent to the Gentiles, and they will hear.
044	ACT	028	029	And when he had said these things, the Jews departed, and had great disputation among themselves.
044	ACT	028	030	And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own rented house, and received all that came to him,
044	ACT	028	031	preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ, with all boldness and without hinderance.

# BOOK	045	ROM	Romans	Romans
045	ROM	001	001	Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, a called apostle, set apart for the gospel of God,
045	ROM	001	002	which he formerly promised through his prophets in the holy scriptures,
045	ROM	001	003	concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, who was born of the posterity of David according to the flesh,
045	ROM	001	004	but declared to be the Son of God with power, according to his holy spiritual nature, by his resurrection from the dead,
045	ROM	001	005	through whom we have received grace and apostleship, in order to the obedience of faith among all nations, for the honor of his name,
045	ROM	001	006	among whom are you also the called of Jesus Christ,
045	ROM	001	007	to all that are in Rome, beloved of God, called saints: Grace be to you, and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
045	ROM	001	008	First, I thank my God, through Jesus Christ, on account of you all, because your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.
045	ROM	001	009	For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that, without ceasing, I make mention of you,
045	ROM	001	010	always in my prayers making request, that, if possible, I may at length have a prosperous journey, by the will of God to come to you.
045	ROM	001	011	For I greatly desire to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift, in order that you may be established;
045	ROM	001	012	that is, that I may both give and receive comfort, while I am among you, through our common faith.
045	ROM	001	013	But, brethren, I do not wish you to be ignorant that I often purposed to come to you, though I have been hindered to the present time, that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.
045	ROM	001	014	I am a debtor both to the Greeks and to the barbarians; both to the wise and to the unwise.
045	ROM	001	015	So that, as far as I am able, I am ready to preach the gospel to you also, who are in Rome.
045	ROM	001	016	For I am not ashamed of the Gospel: for it is the power of God in order to salvation, to every one that believes, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.
045	ROM	001	017	For in it the righteousness of God by faith is revealed, in order to faith: as it is written, He that is justified by faith, shall live.
045	ROM	001	018	For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who, by unrighteousness, restrain the truth.
045	ROM	001	019	Because that which may be known of God, is manifest among them; for God has made it manifest to them,
045	ROM	001	020	(for, since the creation of the world, his attributes, which are invisible, are clearly seen, being perceived through the things that are made, both his eternal power and divinity, ) that they may be without excuse;
045	ROM	001	021	because, when they knew God, they did not glorify him as God, nor were they thankful; but they became perverse in their reasonings, and their wicked heart was darkened;
045	ROM	001	022	professing to be wise, they became foolish,
045	ROM	001	023	and exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for an image like corruptible man, and birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping things.
045	ROM	001	024	For which reason God delivered them up, in the desires of their hearts, to uncleanness, that they might dishonor their bodies among themselves;
045	ROM	001	025	who exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.
045	ROM	001	026	For this reason, God delivered them over to vile passions: for their females exchanged their natural use for that which is against nature:
045	ROM	001	027	and in like manner also the males, leaving the natural use of the females, burned in their lusts one toward another, males with males practicing infamous lewdness, and receiving in themselves the due reward of their error.
045	ROM	001	028	And as they refused to acknowledge God, God delivered them up to an undiscerning mind, to do detestable things;
045	ROM	001	029	as they were filled with all unrighteousness, lewdness, wickedness, covetousness, malice; full of envy, murder, contention, deceit, malignity;
045	ROM	001	030	whisperers, evil-speakers, haters of God, insolent, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents;
045	ROM	001	031	without understanding, covenant-breakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful;
045	ROM	001	032	who, acknowledging the judgment of God, that those who practice such things are worthy of death, not only do them, but approve those who practice them.
045	ROM	002	001	For which reason, you are without excuse, O man, whoever you are, that judge; for in that in which you judge another, you condemn yourself; for you who judge, practice the same things.
045	ROM	002	002	But we know that the judgment of God against those who practice such things, is according to truth.
045	ROM	002	003	But do you, O man, who judge those that practice such things, and yet do the same, conclude that you will escape the judgment of God?
045	ROM	002	004	Or, do you despise the riches of his goodness, and his forbearance, and his long suffering, not knowing that the goodness of God leads you to repentance?
045	ROM	002	005	But, according to your hard and impenitent heart, you treasure up to yourself wrath for a day of wrath, and of the revelation of the righteous judgment of God,
045	ROM	002	006	who will render to every man according to his works;
045	ROM	002	007	to those who, by patient continuance in good works, seek for glory and honor and incorruptibility, eternal life:
045	ROM	002	008	but to those who are contentious, and obey not the truth, but obey unrighteousness, anger and wrath,
045	ROM	002	009	affliction and distress, upon every soul of man that practices what is evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Greek:
045	ROM	002	010	but glory and honor and peace to every one that practices what is good, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek:
045	ROM	002	011	for there is no respect of persons with God.
045	ROM	002	012	For as many as have sinned without law, shall also perish without law; and as many as have sinned under law, shall be judged by law,
045	ROM	002	013	in the day when God shall judge the secret works of men by Jesus Christ, according to my gospel.
045	ROM	002	014	For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.
045	ROM	002	015	For when the Gentiles, who have not a law, do, by nature, the things of the law, these who have not a law, are a law to themselves,
045	ROM	002	016	who show that the work which the law requires, is written in their hearts, their conscience bearing testimony, and their reasonings with each other accusing, or making excuse.
045	ROM	002	017	But if you are named Jew, and rest in the law, and make your boast in God.
045	ROM	002	018	and know his will, and approve what is excellent, being instructed by the law:
045	ROM	002	019	if you are also confident that you yourself are a guide for the blind, a light to those who are in darkness,
045	ROM	002	020	an instructor of the simple, a teacher of the unlearned, because you have the form of true knowledge in the law;
045	ROM	002	021	you, then, who teach another, do you not teach yourself? You who preach that a man should not steal, do you steal?
045	ROM	002	022	You who say that a man should not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who detest idols, do you rob temples?
045	ROM	002	023	You who make your boast in the law, do you, by transgressing the law, dishonor God?
045	ROM	002	024	For the name of God is reviled among the Gentiles, on account of you, as it is written.
045	ROM	002	025	Now, circumcision is indeed profitable, if you keep the law: but, if you transgress the law, your circumcision becomes uncircumcision.
045	ROM	002	026	If, then, he who is uncircumcised keeps the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?
045	ROM	002	027	And shall not he whose want of circumcision is owing to his birth, if he keeps the law, condemn you, who, by the literal circumcision, transgress the law?
045	ROM	002	028	For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, nor is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh:
045	ROM	002	029	but he is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, not in the letter, whose praise is not of men, but of God.
045	ROM	003	001	What advantage then has the Jew, or what profit has circumcision?
045	ROM	003	002	Much in every respect; but chiefly that the oracles of God were intrusted to them.
045	ROM	003	003	What, indeed, if some have been unfaithful? Will their unfaithfulness overthrow the faithfulness of God?
045	ROM	003	004	It can not be. But let God be true, though every man be a liar, as it is written: That thou mightest be justified in thy words, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.
045	ROM	003	005	But if our unrighteousness causes the righteousness of God to be better known, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous, who inflicts punishment? I speak as a man.
045	ROM	003	006	It can not be: for if so, how shall God judge the world?
045	ROM	003	007	Yet, if the truth of God has, through my lie, been greatly advanced to his glory, why am I still judged as a sinner?
045	ROM	003	008	Then, why not say, (as we are slanderously reported as saying, and, as some affirm, that we do say, ) Let us do evil, that good may come? Of such persons the condemnation is just.
045	ROM	003	009	What then? Do we, Jews, excel? Not at all: for we have already convicted all, both Jews and Greeks, of being under sin,
045	ROM	003	010	as it is written: There is none righteous, no, not one;
045	ROM	003	011	there is none that understands; there is none that seeks after God;
045	ROM	003	012	they have all turned out of the way; they have alike become unprofitable; there is none that does good, not even one;
045	ROM	003	013	their throat is an open sepulcher; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips;
045	ROM	003	014	their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness;
045	ROM	003	015	their feet are swift to shed blood;
045	ROM	003	016	destruction and misery are in their ways;
045	ROM	003	017	and the way of peace they have not known;
045	ROM	003	018	there is no fear of God before their eyes.
045	ROM	003	019	Now we know that what the law says, it speaks to those who are under the law, that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world become guilty before God.
045	ROM	003	020	Wherefore, by works of law, no flesh shall be justified in his sight; for by law is the knowledge of sin.
045	ROM	003	021	But now, the righteousness of God without law is revealed, being attested by the law and the prophets;
045	ROM	003	022	I repeat it, the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ, which is for all, and on all that believe; for there is no difference;
045	ROM	003	023	for all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God,
045	ROM	003	024	yet may be justified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus;
045	ROM	003	025	whom God has set forth as a propitiatory sacrifice, through faith in his blood, in order to manifest his righteousness, in passing by the sins that were formerly committed through the forbearance of God;
045	ROM	003	026	in order to manifest his righteousness at the present time, that he might be just, while he justifies him who believes in Jesus.
045	ROM	003	027	Where, then, is boasting? It is excluded. By what law? Of works? No; but by the law of faith.
045	ROM	003	028	For we conclude that a man is justified by faith, without deeds of law.
045	ROM	003	029	Is he the God of the Jews only? Is he not also the God of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also:
045	ROM	003	030	since there is one God, who will justify the circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through the faith.
045	ROM	003	031	Do we, then, make law void through the faith? It can not be. On the other hand, we establish law.
045	ROM	004	001	What, then, shall we say that Abraham our father has found, as it respects the flesh?
045	ROM	004	002	For if Abraham was justified by works, he has cause for boasting, but not before God.
045	ROM	004	003	For what says the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness.
045	ROM	004	004	Now to him that works, the reward is not counted as a favor, but as a debt:
045	ROM	004	005	but to him that works not, but believes on him that justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.
045	ROM	004	006	Even as David also speaks of the blessedness of the man to whom God counts righteousness without works, saying:
045	ROM	004	007	Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.
045	ROM	004	008	Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not charge sin.
045	ROM	004	009	Comes this blessedness then on those who are circumcised only, or on those who are uncircumcised also? For we say that faith was counted to Abraham for righteousness.
045	ROM	004	010	Under what circumstances, then, was it counted? After he was circumcised? Or, while he was uncircumcised? Not after he was circumcised, but while he was uncircumcised.
045	ROM	004	011	And he received the sign of circumcision, as a seal of the righteousness of the faith that he had while he was uncircumcised, in order that he might be the father of all that believe, even in a state of uncircumcision, so that righteousness might be counted to them also;
045	ROM	004	012	and the father of circumcision to those who are not only circumcised, but who, also, walk in the steps of that faith which our father Abraham had while he was yet uncircumcised.
045	ROM	004	013	For the promise that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham, nor to his posterity, through law, but through the righteousness of faith.
045	ROM	004	014	For if they that are of the law be heirs, the faith is made powerless, and the promise is unmeaning;
045	ROM	004	015	for the law inflicts punishment; for where no law is, there is no transgression.
045	ROM	004	016	Therefore, the inheritance is by faith, that it may be according to grace, in order that the promise may be sure to all his posterity, not to those only who are of the law, but to those, also, who are of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all,
045	ROM	004	017	(as it is written: I have made you a father of many nations, ) in the sight of him in whom he believed, even God, who makes the dead alive, and calls those things which are not, as though they were.
045	ROM	004	018	He, against hope, confidently believed that he would become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken: So shall your posterity be.
045	ROM	004	019	And not being weak in faith, he considered not his own body, which was already dead, (for he was about a hundred years old, ) nor the deadness of Sarah’s womb;
045	ROM	004	020	and he doubted not, through unbelief, with respect to the promise of God, but was strong in faith, giving glory to God,
045	ROM	004	021	and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to perform.
045	ROM	004	022	For this reason, it was counted to him for righteousness.
045	ROM	004	023	But that it was counted to him, was not written for his sake alone,
045	ROM	004	024	but for our sakes also, to whom it shall be counted, if we believe on him that raised Jesus our Lord from the dead,
045	ROM	004	025	who was delivered up for our offenses, and raised again for our justification.
045	ROM	005	001	Therefore, being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,
045	ROM	005	002	through whom we have had access, by faith, into this grace in which we stand; and we rejoice in hope of the glory of God.
045	ROM	005	003	And not only so, but we rejoice in afflictions also; because we know that affliction produces patience,
045	ROM	005	004	and patience, an approved character, and an approved character, hope;
045	ROM	005	005	and this hope disappoints us not; because the love of God is poured abundantly into our hearts through the Holy Spirit that is given to us.
045	ROM	005	006	For when we were yet without strength, at the appointed time, Christ died for the ungodly.
045	ROM	005	007	For hardly, indeed, will one die for a just man; yet, perhaps, for the good man some one would even dare to die.
045	ROM	005	008	But God makes known his love to us in this, that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us:
045	ROM	005	009	much more, then, since we are now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from the wrath through him.
045	ROM	005	010	For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, having been reconciled, shall we be saved by his life.
045	ROM	005	011	And not only so, but we rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the reconciliation.
045	ROM	005	012	For this reason, as by one man sin entered into the world, and by his sin, death; and so death passed through to all men, because all have sinned:
045	ROM	005	013	for till the law, sin was in the world; but sin is not charged where there is no law.
045	ROM	005	014	Yet death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that did not sin in the likeness of Adam’s transgression, who is the type of him that was to come.
045	ROM	005	015	But the favor bestowed is not, in all respects, like the offense: for if, by the offense of one, the many have died, much more have the grace of God and the gift which is by the grace of the one man Jesus Christ, been made abundant for the many.
045	ROM	005	016	And the gift is not like the sentence that came through one who sinned: for the sentence to condemnation was because of one offense; but the favor bestowed in order to justification, is because of many offenses.
045	ROM	005	017	For if, by one man’s offense, death has reigned through that one, much more shall those who receive the abundance of the grace, and of the gift of righteousness, reign in life through the one, who is Jesus Christ.
045	ROM	005	018	Therefore, as, by one offense, sentence came on all men to condemnation, so, also, by one act of righteousness, the gift has come on all men to justification of life.
045	ROM	005	019	For as by the disobedience of the one man the many have been made sinners, so, also, by the obedience of the one, the many shall be made righteous.
045	ROM	005	020	But, besides the first offense, law was introduced, in order that offenses might abound: but where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:
045	ROM	005	021	that as sin has reigned, ending in death, so might grace reign by justification, ending in life eternal, through Jesus Christ our Lord.
045	ROM	006	001	What, then, shall we say? Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound?
045	ROM	006	002	It can not be. How shall we that are dead to sin, live any longer in it?
045	ROM	006	003	Know you not that as many of us as were immersed into Christ Jesus, were immersed into his death?
045	ROM	006	004	Therefore, we are buried with him, by immersion, into death, that as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, so also we should walk in a new life.
045	ROM	006	005	For if we have become united to him by the likeness of his death, we shall certainly be united to him by the likeness of his resurrection;
045	ROM	006	006	knowing this, that our former man has been crucified with him, in order that the sinful body may be deprived of its power, so that we should no longer serve sin:
045	ROM	006	007	for he that is dead is freed from sin.
045	ROM	006	008	Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him;
045	ROM	006	009	because we know that Christ, having been raised from the dead, dies no more; death has dominion over him no longer;
045	ROM	006	010	for, as it regards his dying, he, once for all, died to sin; but as it regards his living, he lives to God.
045	ROM	006	011	So also do you count yourselves as dead indeed to sin, but as living to God, in Christ Jesus our Lord.
045	ROM	006	012	Therefore, let not sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey it;
045	ROM	006	013	and present not your members to sin, as instruments of unrighteousness: but present yourselves to God, as alive from the dead; and your members to God, as instruments of righteousness.
045	ROM	006	014	For sin shall not have dominion over you; for you are not under law, but under grace.
045	ROM	006	015	What then? Shall we sin, because we are not under law, but under grace? It can not be.
045	ROM	006	016	Know you not, that to whom you present yourselves as servants to obey, his servants you are whom you obey, whether of sin that leads to death, or of obedience that leads to righteousness?
045	ROM	006	017	But thanks be to God, that though you were the servants of sin, yet you have obeyed from the heart the form of teaching, in which you have been instructed;
045	ROM	006	018	and being made free from sin, you have become the servants of righteousness.
045	ROM	006	019	I speak of what is common among men, oil account of the weakness of your flesh: for as you have presented your members as servants to uncleanness, and to lawlessness, in order to lawlessness, so now present your members as servants to righteousness, in order to holiness.
045	ROM	006	020	For when you were the servants of sin, you were free with respect to righteousness.
045	ROM	006	021	What fruit, therefore, had you at that time, in those things of which you are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death.
045	ROM	006	022	But now, since you have been made free from sin, and have become servants to God, you have your fruit to holiness, and the end, eternal life.
045	ROM	006	023	For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.
045	ROM	007	001	Know you not, brethren, for I speak to you that are acquainted with law, that the law has dominion over a man as long as he lives?
045	ROM	007	002	For the woman that has a husband, is bound by the law to her husband as long as he lives: but if her husband die, she is loosed from the law of her husband.
045	ROM	007	003	So then, if, while her husband lives, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress. But if her husband die, she is free from the law; so that she is not an adulteress, though she be married to another man.
045	ROM	007	004	So then, my brethren, you, also, have died to the law, by the body of the Christ, in order that you may be married to another, to him who was raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit to God.
045	ROM	007	005	For when we were in the flesh, the sinful passions which were excited by the law, were active in our members, so as to bring forth fruit to death:
045	ROM	007	006	but now we are made free from the law, being dead to that by which we were bound, so that we may serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.
045	ROM	007	007	What, then, shall we say? Is the law sin? It can not be. Indeed, I had not known sin, except through law. For I had not known evil desire, unless the law had said: You shall not have any evil desire.
045	ROM	007	008	But sin, taking occasion through the commandment, rendered active within me every evil desire. For without the law, sin was dead.
045	ROM	007	009	Indeed, I was alive without the law, once; but when the commandment came, sin became alive, and I died:
045	ROM	007	010	and the commandment, which was given for life, I found to be for death.
045	ROM	007	011	For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me.
045	ROM	007	012	Therefore, the law is holy, and the commandment, holy and just and good.
045	ROM	007	013	Has, then, that which is good become death to me? It can not be. But sin, that it, might appear sin, was causing death to me through that which is good, in order that sin, through the commandment, might become exceedingly sinful.
045	ROM	007	014	For we know that the law is spiritual; but I am carnal, sold into bondage to sin.
045	ROM	007	015	For what I do, I know not: for that which I wish to do, this I do not; but that which I hate, this I do.
045	ROM	007	016	If, then, I do that which I wish not to do, I give assent to the law, that it is good.
045	ROM	007	017	Now, then, it is no longer I that do it, but sin that dwells in me.
045	ROM	007	018	For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwells no good; for to will is present with me; but to perform that which is good, I find not.
045	ROM	007	019	For the good that I wish to do, I do not; but the evil that I wish not to do, this I do.
045	ROM	007	020	Now, if I do that which I wish not to do, it is no longer I that do it, but sin that dwells in me.
045	ROM	007	021	I find, then, this law: That, when I wish to do good, evil is present with me.
045	ROM	007	022	For, in the inward man, I delight in the law of God:
045	ROM	007	023	but I perceive another law in my members, at war with the law of my mind, and making me a captive to the law of sin, which is in my members.
045	ROM	007	024	Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body that subjects me to death?
045	ROM	007	025	I thank God that I shall be delivered through Jesus Christ our Lord. Therefore, I myself, with the mind, serve the law of God, but with the flesh, the law of sin.
045	ROM	008	001	There is now, therefore, no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus.
045	ROM	008	002	For the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has freed me from the law of sin, and of death.
045	ROM	008	003	For what the law could not do, because it was weak through the flesh, God has done, who, sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for a sin-offering, condemned sin in the flesh,
045	ROM	008	004	that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.
045	ROM	008	005	For those who are according to the flesh, mind the things of the flesh; but those who are according to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit.
045	ROM	008	006	For the mind of the flesh is death; but the mind of the Spirit is life and peace.
045	ROM	008	007	Because the mind of the flesh is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, nor indeed can it be.
045	ROM	008	008	Those, then, who are in the flesh, can not please God.
045	ROM	008	009	But you are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. Now, if any one has not the Spirit of Christ, he is not his.
045	ROM	008	010	But if Christ is in you, the body is dead, on account of sin, but the Spirit is life, on account of righteousness.
045	ROM	008	011	And if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he that raised the Christ from the dead will give life to your mortal bodies, because of his Spirit that dwells in you.
045	ROM	008	012	Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh;
045	ROM	008	013	for if you live according to the flesh, you shall die: but if, through the Spirit, you put to death the deeds of the body, you shall live.
045	ROM	008	014	For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.
045	ROM	008	015	For you have not again received the spirit of bondage, that you may fear; but you have received the spirit of adoption, by which we cry, Abba, Father.
045	ROM	008	016	The Spirit itself testifies with our spirit, that we are the children of God;
045	ROM	008	017	and, if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with him, that we may also be glorified together.
045	ROM	008	018	For I consider the sufferings of the present time not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed for us.
045	ROM	008	019	For the earnest expectation of the creature waits for the revelation of the sons of God.
045	ROM	008	020	For the creature was subject to frailty, (not by its own will, but for his sake who subjected it, )
045	ROM	008	021	in hope, that even the creature itself shall be made free from the bondage of corruption, and introduced into the glorious liberty of the children of God.
045	ROM	008	022	For we know that every creature groans, and is in pain together, till now:
045	ROM	008	023	and not only they, but ourselves also, who have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, the redemption of our body.
045	ROM	008	024	For we are saved by this hope; but hope that is seen is not hope; for, what any one sees, why does he also hope for it?
045	ROM	008	025	But if we hope for that which we see not we wait for it with patience.
045	ROM	008	026	In like manner, also, the Spirit helps our infirmities; for we know not what we should pray for as we ought, but the Spirit itself intercedes for us, with groanings unutterable.
045	ROM	008	027	And he that searches the hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, that he intercedes for the saints according to the will of God.
045	ROM	008	028	And we know that all things work together for good, to those who love God, to those who are called according to his purpose.
045	ROM	008	029	For those whom he foreknew, he predestinated to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the first-born among many brethren:
045	ROM	008	030	and those whom he predestinated he also called, and those whom he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified.
045	ROM	008	031	What, then, shall we say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us?
045	ROM	008	032	He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how will he not with him also freely give us all things?
045	ROM	008	033	Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God’s elect? It is God that justifies.
045	ROM	008	034	Who is he that condemns? It is Christ that died: rather, indeed, that has risen, who is at the right hand of God, who also intercedes for us.
045	ROM	008	035	Who shall separate us from the love of the Christ? Shall affliction, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or the sword?
045	ROM	008	036	As it is written: For thy sake, we are killed all the day long; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter.
045	ROM	008	037	Yet, in all these things, we are more than conquerors, through him that loved us.
045	ROM	008	038	For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,
045	ROM	008	039	nor hight, nor depth, nor any other creature, will be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
045	ROM	009	001	I speak the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience bearing me testimony in the Holy Spirit,
045	ROM	009	002	That I have great sorrow and unceasing grief in my heart;
045	ROM	009	003	for I could wish myself to be accursed from Christ, for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh;
045	ROM	009	004	who are Israelites, to whom belong the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service, and the promises;
045	ROM	009	005	to whom belong the fathers, and of whom is the Christ, as it respects the flesh, who is over all, God blessed forever. Amen.
045	ROM	009	006	It is not possible that the word of God has failed; for they are not all Israel who are of Israel.
045	ROM	009	007	Nor, because they are the posterity of Abraham, are they all children: but in Isaac shall your posterity be called.
045	ROM	009	008	That is, the children of the flesh are not the children of God; but the children of the promise are counted for the posterity.
045	ROM	009	009	For the word of the promise is this: At this time will I come, and Sarah shall have a son.
045	ROM	009	010	Not only so, but when Rebecca had conceived by one, even our father Isaac,
045	ROM	009	011	(the children, indeed, having not yet been born, and having done neither good nor evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calls, )
045	ROM	009	012	it was said to her: The elder shall serve the younger;
045	ROM	009	013	as it is written: Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.
045	ROM	009	014	What, then, shall we say? Is there unrighteousness with. God? It can not be.
045	ROM	009	015	For he says to Moses: I will show mercy to whom I will show mercy; and I will show compassion to whom I will show compassion.
045	ROM	009	016	Therefore, it is not of him that wills, nor of him that runs, but of God that shows mercy.
045	ROM	009	017	For the scripture says to Pharaoh: For this very purpose have I raised you up, that I may show in you my power, and that my name may be published in all the earth.
045	ROM	009	018	Therefore, he has mercy on whom he wills to have mercy: and whom he wills to harden, he hardens.
045	ROM	009	019	You will then say to me, Why does he yet find fault? For who has resisted his will?
045	ROM	009	020	No, but rather, O man, who are you that dispute with God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed, it, Why have you made me thus?
045	ROM	009	021	Has not the potter power over the clay, to make from the same mass one vessel for honor, and another for dishonor?
045	ROM	009	022	What, then, if God, intending to show his wrath, and to make his power known, yet, in much long-suffering bore with the vessels of wrath fitted for destruction:
045	ROM	009	023	and, that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy which he before prepared for glory, showed mercy to us,
045	ROM	009	024	whom he has called, not only from among the Jews, but also from the Gentiles?
045	ROM	009	025	As he says also in Hosea: I will call that my people which is not my people, and her beloved, who was not beloved.
045	ROM	009	026	And it shall come to pass, that, in the place where it was said to them: You are not my people, there shall they be called the sons of the living God.
045	ROM	009	027	But Isaiah cries concerning Israel: Though the number of the sons of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved:
045	ROM	009	028	for his word he fulfills, and he decrees in righteousness; for his word that is decreed, will the Lord execute upon the land.
045	ROM	009	029	And as Isaiah said before: Unless the Lord of hosts had left us a posterity, we should have been like Sodom, and been made like Gomorrah.
045	ROM	009	030	What, then, shall we say? That the Gentiles, who did not seek after justification, have obtained justification, even the justification which is by faith:
045	ROM	009	031	but Israel, who sought after a law of justification, has not attained to a law of justification.
045	ROM	009	032	And why? Because they sought it not by faith, but as if by works of law: for they stumbled against that stone of stumbling,
045	ROM	009	033	as it is written: Behold, I lay in Zion a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense: and whoever believes on him, shall not be ashamed.
045	ROM	010	001	Brethren, my heart’s desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they may be saved.
045	ROM	010	002	For I testify for them, that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge.
045	ROM	010	003	For being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and seeking to establish their own plan of justification, they have not submitted to the righteousness of God.
045	ROM	010	004	For Christ is the end of the law for justification, to every one that believes.
045	ROM	010	005	For Moses describes the justification which is by the law: That the man who does these things shall live by them.
045	ROM	010	006	But the justification by faith speaks thus: Say not in your heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? that is, to bring Christ down;
045	ROM	010	007	or, Who shall descend into the abyss? that is, to bring Christ again from the dead.
045	ROM	010	008	But what says it? The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart; that is, the word of faith which we preach;
045	ROM	010	009	that if you will confess with your mouth, that Jesus is Lord, and will believe in your heart that God has raised him from the dead, you shall be saved.
045	ROM	010	010	For with the heart we believe, in order to justification; and with the mouth we make confession, it order to salvation.
045	ROM	010	011	For the scripture says: He that believes on him shall not be ashamed.
045	ROM	010	012	For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek; for the same Lord of all is rich to all that call on him:
045	ROM	010	013	For every one that calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.
045	ROM	010	014	How, then, shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher?
045	ROM	010	015	And how shall they preach, unless they be sent? As it is written: How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the gospel of peace, who bring joyous news of good things!
045	ROM	010	016	But they have not all obeyed the gospel; for Isaiah says: Lord, who has believed our report?
045	ROM	010	017	So, then, faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.
045	ROM	010	018	But I say: Have they not heard? Yes, verily; their voice has gone forth into all the earth: and their words to the ends of the world.
045	ROM	010	019	But I say: Did not Israel know? First, Moses says: I will excite you to jealousy by that which is no nation; and by a foolish nation I will provoke you to wrath.
045	ROM	010	020	But Isaiah is very bold, and says: I was found by them that sought me not: I was made manifest to them that asked not after me.
045	ROM	010	021	But with respect to Israel, he says: All day long have I stretched out my hands to a disobedient and contradicting people.
045	ROM	011	001	I say, then, Has God rejected his people? It can not be. For I am an Israelite, of the posterity of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.
045	ROM	011	002	God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew. Know you not what the scripture says, in regard to Elijah? how he intercedes with God against Israel, saying:
045	ROM	011	003	Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thy altars, and I am left alone, and they seek: my life.
045	ROM	011	004	But what says the answer of God to him? I have reserved for myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to Baal.
045	ROM	011	005	Thus, then, at the present time also, there is a remnant according to the election of grace.
045	ROM	011	006	And if the election is by grace, it is no longer by works; otherwise grace is no longer grace.
045	ROM	011	007	What then? Israel has not obtained that which he seeks; but the chosen have obtained it, and the rest have been hardened to this day,
045	ROM	011	008	as it is written: God has given them a spirit of stupor, eyes with which they can not see, and ears with which they can not hear.
045	ROM	011	009	And David says: Let their table become a trap, and a net, and a snare, and a recompense to them;
045	ROM	011	010	let their eyes be darkened, so that they may not see, and let them bow down their back always.
045	ROM	011	011	I say, then, Have they stumbled, in order that they may fall? It can not be. But rather, through their fall, salvation has come to the Gentiles, to excite them to jealousy.
045	ROM	011	012	Now, if their fall be the riches of the world, and their loss be the riches of the Gentiles, how much more shall their full acceptance be the riches of the world?
045	ROM	011	013	For I speak to you, Gentiles; inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I do honor to my ministry,
045	ROM	011	014	if, by any means, I may excite to jealousy those who are my flesh, and save some of them.
045	ROM	011	015	For, if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the reception of them be, but life from the dead?
045	ROM	011	016	Now, if the first fruit is holy, the mass is holy also: and if the root is holy, the branches are holy also.
045	ROM	011	017	And if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive, have been grafted in among them, and partake with them of the root and fatness of the olive,
045	ROM	011	018	boast not against the branches; but if you boast, boast not that you bear the root, but that the root bears you.
045	ROM	011	019	You will say then: The branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in.
045	ROM	011	020	Well; on account of unbelief they were broken off; but you stand by faith. Be not high-minded, but fear.
045	ROM	011	021	For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed, lest he spare not you.
045	ROM	011	022	Behold, then, the goodness and severity of God: toward them that fell; severity; but toward you, goodness, if you continue in his goodness; otherwise, you also shall be cut off.
045	ROM	011	023	And they, also, if they continue not in unbelief, shall be grafted in: for God is able to graft them in again.
045	ROM	011	024	For if you were cut out from an olive-tree that is wild by nature, and were grafted, against nature, into a good olive, how much more shall these, which are the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive?
045	ROM	011	025	For I do not wish you, brethren, to be ignorant of this mystery―lest you be wise in your own conceit―that blindness has happened to Israel in part, till the full number of the Gentiles shall have come in.
045	ROM	011	026	And so all Israel shall be saved, as it is written: There shall come out of Zion the Deliverer, and he shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob.
045	ROM	011	027	And this is my covenant with them, when I shall take away their sins.
045	ROM	011	028	As it respects the gospel, they are enemies of God for your sakes; but as it respects their election, they are beloved for the fathers sakes:
045	ROM	011	029	for God’s gifts and calling are irrevocable.
045	ROM	011	030	For as you formerly did not believe God, but now have obtained mercy through their unbelief;
045	ROM	011	031	so, also, these have not now believed, that through the mercy shown to you, they also may obtain mercy.
045	ROM	011	032	For God has delivered them all over to unbelief, that he may have mercy on them all.
045	ROM	011	033	O the depth of the riches, both of the wisdom and of the knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!
045	ROM	011	034	For who has known the mind of the Lord? Or, who has been his counsellor?
045	ROM	011	035	Or, who has first given to him, and received from him a recompense?
045	ROM	011	036	For from him, and by him, and for him, are all things. To him be glory through the ages! Amen.
045	ROM	012	001	I beseech you, therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service.
045	ROM	012	002	And be not conformed to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may learn what the will of God is―the good, and the acceptable, and the perfect.
045	ROM	012	003	For I say, through the grace given to me, to every one that is among you, that he must not think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but that he be disposed to think modestly, as God has distributed to each a measure of faith.
045	ROM	012	004	For as we have many members in one body, and all the members have not the same office,
045	ROM	012	005	so we, the many, are one body in Christ, and members one of another.
045	ROM	012	006	Since, then, we have gifts which differ according to the grace that is given to us, whether we have the gift of prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of our faith;
045	ROM	012	007	or, if we have a ministry, let us be active in our ministry; if any one teaches, let him attend to his teaching;
045	ROM	012	008	or, if any exhorts, let him attend to exhortation; if any one gives, let him do it with sincerity; he that rules, with diligence: he that shows mercy, with cheerfulness.
045	ROM	012	009	Let love be without hypocrisy. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good;
045	ROM	012	010	in love to the brotherhood, be kindly affectionate one to another; in showing honor, be examples one to another;
045	ROM	012	011	in what requires diligence, be not slothful; in spirit, be fervent; in service, be devoted to the Lord;
045	ROM	012	012	in hope, be joyful; in affliction, be patient; in prayer, be persevering;
045	ROM	012	013	administer to the necessities of the saints; be careful to entertain strangers;
045	ROM	012	014	bless them that persecute you; bless, and curse not;
045	ROM	012	015	rejoice with them that rejoice, and weep with them that weep;
045	ROM	012	016	cultivate the same disposition, one toward another: mind not high things, but conform yourselves to things that are lowly. Be not wise in your own conceits;
045	ROM	012	017	repay to no one evil for evil; practice that which is honorable in the sight of all men.
045	ROM	012	018	If possible, as far as may be in your power, be at peace with all men.
045	ROM	012	019	Beloved, avenge not yourselves, but give place to the wrath of God; for it is written: Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord.
045	ROM	012	020	If, therefore, your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him drink; for by doing this, you will heap coals of fire on his head.
045	ROM	012	021	Be not overcome by evil; but overcome evil with good.
045	ROM	013	001	Let every soul be subject to the higher authorities. For there is no authority but from God: the authorities that are, have been appointed by God.
045	ROM	013	002	Therefore, he that resists the authority, resists the appointment of God; and those who resist shall receive to themselves condemnation.
045	ROM	013	003	For rulers are not a terror to works that are good, but to those which are evil. Will you, then, not be afraid of the authority? Do that which is good, and you shall receive praise from the same.
045	ROM	013	004	For he is the minister of God to you for that which is good. But if you do what is evil, be afraid; for he bears not the sword in vain. For he is the minister of God to inflict punishment on him that does evil.
045	ROM	013	005	Wherefore, it is necessary to be subject, not only because of punishment, but also for conscience sake.
045	ROM	013	006	On this very account, too, pay tribute also: for they are the public servants of God, attending continually to this very thing.
045	ROM	013	007	Render, therefore, to all their dues; tribute, to whom tribute is due; custom, to whom custom; fear, to whom fear; honor, to whom honor is due.
045	ROM	013	008	Owe no one any thing, except to love one another; for he that loves another, has fulfilled the law.
045	ROM	013	009	For these commandments: You shall not commit adultery, you shall not kill, you shall not steal, you shall not indulge evil desire; and if there is any other commandment, all are summed up in this saying, namely: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.
045	ROM	013	010	Love works no evil to our neighbor; therefore, love is the fulfilling of the law.
045	ROM	013	011	And do this, because you know the time, that the hour has already come when we should awake out of sleep; for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed:
045	ROM	013	012	the night is far advanced, the day draws near. Let us, therefore, put off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light.
045	ROM	013	013	Let us walk in a becoming manner, as in the day; not in riotings and in drunkenness, not in lewdness and in wantonness, not in contention and in envy:
045	ROM	013	014	but put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the desires of the flesh.
045	ROM	014	001	Him that is weak in the faith, receive kindly, but not to judge his reasonings.
045	ROM	014	002	One believes that he may eat all things; another, who is weak, eats herbs.
045	ROM	014	003	Let not him that eats, despise him that eats not; and let not him that eats not, judge him that eats: for God has received him.
045	ROM	014	004	Who are you that judge another man’s servant? To his own master he stands or falls; indeed, he shall stand, for God is able to make him stand.
045	ROM	014	005	One man thinks that one day is better than another; another thinks that every day is alike. Let each be fully assured in his own mind.
045	ROM	014	006	He that regards the day, to the Lord he regards it; and he that does not regard the day, to the Lord he does not regard it. He that eats, eats to the Lord; for he gives God thanks: and he that eats not, to the Lord he eats not, and gives God thanks.
045	ROM	014	007	For no one lives to himself, and no one dies to himself.
045	ROM	014	008	For if we live, we live to the Lord; or if we die, we die to the Lord. Whether, therefore, we live or die, we are the Lord’s.
045	ROM	014	009	For this very purpose, Christ both died and rose, and lived again, that he might have dominion over the dead and the living.
045	ROM	014	010	But why do you judge your brother? Or why do you despise your brother? For we all shall stand before the judgment-seat of the Christ.
045	ROM	014	011	For it is written: As I live, says the Lord, to me every knee shall bow, and every tongue shall confess to God.
045	ROM	014	012	Therefore, every one of us shall give an account of himself to God.
045	ROM	014	013	Let us, therefore, no longer judge one another: but rather decide to put no stumbling-block or snare in your brother’s way.
045	ROM	014	014	I know and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean of itself; but if any one thinks that any thing is unclean, to him it is unclean.
045	ROM	014	015	But if your brother is grieved on account of your food, you no longer walk according to love. Do not, with your food, destroy him, for whom Christ died.
045	ROM	014	016	Therefore, let not that which is your good be evil spoken of.
045	ROM	014	017	For the kingdom of God is not food and drink, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.
045	ROM	014	018	For he who serves the Christ in these things is acceptable to God, and approved by men.
045	ROM	014	019	Therefore, let us seek those things which belong to peace, and those which tend to mutual edification.
045	ROM	014	020	Destroy not the work of God on account of food. All meats, indeed, are clean; but meat is an evil to that man who, by eating, causes another to stumble.
045	ROM	014	021	It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor to do any thing by which your brother stumbles, or is ensnared, or is made weak.
045	ROM	014	022	Have you faith? Have it to yourself before God. Blessed is he who condemns not himself in that which he approves.
045	ROM	014	023	But he that doubts is condemned, if he eat, because he eats not with faith. Every thing that is not of faith, is sin.
045	ROM	015	001	But we that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of those who are not strong, and not to please ourselves.
045	ROM	015	002	Let each one of us please his neighbor in that which is good for his edification.
045	ROM	015	003	For the Christ did not please himself; but as it is written: The reproaches of them that reproached thee, fell on me.
045	ROM	015	004	For the things which were formerly written, were written for our instruction, that we, through the patience and the comfort which the scriptures give, might have hope.
045	ROM	015	005	Now, may the God of patience and comfort make you of the same mind one toward another, according to Christ Jesus;
045	ROM	015	006	that with one mind and with one voice you may glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
045	ROM	015	007	Wherefore, receive one another with kindness, as the Christ has received you, to the glory of God.
045	ROM	015	008	Now, I say, that Jesus Christ, as a minister, was of the circumcision for the sake of the truth of God, in order to confirm the promises made to the fathers,
045	ROM	015	009	and that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy, as it is written: For this cause I will give praise to thee among the Gentiles, and to thy name will I sing.
045	ROM	015	010	And again he says: Rejoice, you Gentiles, with his people.
045	ROM	015	011	And again: Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles, and applaud him all you peoples.
045	ROM	015	012	And again, Isaiah says: There shall be a root of Jesse, and he that shall rise to rule the Gentiles, in him shall the Gentiles trust.
045	ROM	015	013	Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in the hope, by the power of the Holy Spirit.
045	ROM	015	014	And I myself am persuaded concerning you, my brethren, that you yourselves are full of all goodness, having been filled with all knowledge, able also to instruct one another.
045	ROM	015	015	Yet I have written to you more boldly in part, my brethren, as if I would put you in remembrance, on account of the grace which is given to me by God,
045	ROM	015	016	that I may be the public servant of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, officiating as a priest with respect to the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles may be acceptable, having been sanctified by the Holy Spirit.
045	ROM	015	017	I have, therefore, cause to glory in Christ Jesus in things that pertain to God.
045	ROM	015	018	For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ has not accomplished through me, by word and deed, in order to make the Gentiles obedient,
045	ROM	015	019	by the power of signs and wonders by the power of the Holy Spirit. So that from Jerusalem, and round about as far as Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of the Christ;
045	ROM	015	020	so earnestly desirous have I been to preach the gospel, not where Christ had been named, lest I should build on another man’s foundation;
045	ROM	015	021	but, as it is written: They to whom he was not preached, shall see; and they who have not heard, shall understand.
045	ROM	015	022	For which reason, also, I have been often hindered from coming to you.
045	ROM	015	023	But now, having no longer a place in these regions, and having had for many years a strong desire to come to you,
045	ROM	015	024	when I make my journey into Spain, I hope, in passing through, to see you, and to be conducted by you on my journey thither, after I am first partly satisfied with your company.
045	ROM	015	025	But now I am going to Jerusalem, to minister to the saints.
045	ROM	015	026	For Macedonia and Achaia have been pleased to make a contribution for the poor saints who are in Jerusalem:
045	ROM	015	027	they have been pleased to do so, and they are their debtors. For if the Gentiles have become partakers of their spiritual things, they ought to minister to them in things pertaining to the flesh.
045	ROM	015	028	When, therefore, I shall have performed this, and have delivered to them this fruit, I will go by you into Spain.
045	ROM	015	029	And I know that in coming to you, I shall come in the fullness of the blessing of Christ.
045	ROM	015	030	Now I beseech you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the love of the Spirit, that you strive together with me, in your prayers to God for me,
045	ROM	015	031	that I may be delivered from the unbelievers in Judea, and that this service of mine, which is for Jerusalem, may be acceptable to the saints;
045	ROM	015	032	that I may come to you with joy, by the will of God, and may be refreshed among you.
045	ROM	015	033	The God of peace be with you all. Amen.
045	ROM	016	001	I commend to you Phœbe our sister, who is a deaconess of the church that is in Cenchrea,
045	ROM	016	002	that you receive her in the Lord in a manner worthy of saints, and that you aid her in whatever matter she may have need of you; for she has aided many, and myself also.
045	ROM	016	003	Salute Priscilla and Aquila, my fellow-laborers in Christ Jesus;
045	ROM	016	004	who, for my life, laid down their own necks; to whom not only do I give thanks, but all the churches of the Gentiles:
045	ROM	016	005	and salute the church that is in their house. Salute Epenetus my beloved, who is the first fruits of Asia to Christ.
045	ROM	016	006	Salute Mary, who bestowed much labor on us.
045	ROM	016	007	Salute Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen, and my fellow-prisoners, who are noted among the apostles, who, also, were in Christ before me.
045	ROM	016	008	Salute Amplias, my beloved in the Lord.
045	ROM	016	009	Salute Urbanus, our fellow-workman in Christ, and Stachys my beloved.
045	ROM	016	010	Salute Appelles, approved in Christ. Salute those who are of the household of Aristobulus.
045	ROM	016	011	Salute Herodion, my kinsman. Salute those of the household of Narcissus, who are in the Lord.
045	ROM	016	012	Salute Tryphena and Tryphosa, who labored in the Lord. Salute Persis the beloved, who labored much in the Lord.
045	ROM	016	013	Salute Rufus, the chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine.
045	ROM	016	014	Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hernias, Patrobas, Hermes, and the brethren with them.
045	ROM	016	015	Salute Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints that are with them.
045	ROM	016	016	Salute one another with a holy kiss. The churches of the Christ salute you.
045	ROM	016	017	Now I beseech you, brethren, to mark those who make divisions and cause offenses in opposition to the teaching which you have learned, and avoid them.
045	ROM	016	018	For such serve not our Lord Christ, but their own appetites; and, by good words and fair speeches, they deceive the hearts of the simple.
045	ROM	016	019	For your obedience has gone abroad to all men: I rejoice, therefore, on your account. But I desire you to be wise in respect to that which is good, and guileless in respect to that which is evil.
045	ROM	016	020	The God of peace will soon bruise Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
045	ROM	016	021	Timothy, my fellow-workman, and Lucius and Jason and Sosipater, my kinsmen, salute you.
045	ROM	016	022	I, Tertius, who wrote this letter, salute you in the Lord.
045	ROM	016	023	Gaius, my host, and the host of the whole church, salutes you. Erastus the treasurer of the city, and Quartus, my brother, salute you.
045	ROM	016	024	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
045	ROM	016	025	Now to him who is able to strengthen you according to my gospel, even the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery which was concealed during the times of the ages,
045	ROM	016	026	but is now made manifest, and through the scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the eternal God, made known among all nations for the obedience of faith,
045	ROM	016	027	to the only wise God, through Jesus Christ, be glory throughout the ages. Amen.

# BOOK	046	1CO	1 Corinthians	1 Corinthians
046	1CO	001	001	Paul, a called apostle of Jesus Christ, by the will of God, and Sosthenes my brother,
046	1CO	001	002	to the church of God which is in Corinth, to the sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints, with all that in every place call on the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours:
046	1CO	001	003	grace be to you, and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
046	1CO	001	004	I thank my God always on your account, for the grace of God which is given to you in Christ Jesus;
046	1CO	001	005	that you are enriched by him in every thing, in all speech, and in all knowledge,
046	1CO	001	006	even as the testimony concerning the Christ was con firmed among you,
046	1CO	001	007	so that you are deficient in no gift, while waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ.
046	1CO	001	008	He also will establish you even to the end, and make you blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.
046	1CO	001	009	God is faithful, by whom you have been called into the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.
046	1CO	001	010	Now, I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing, and that there be no schisms among you, but that you be perfectly united in the same mind, and in the same judgment.
046	1CO	001	011	For it has been made known to me concerning you, my brethren, by the family of Cloe, that there are contentions among you.
046	1CO	001	012	I mean this: that each one of you says, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ.
046	1CO	001	013	Is the Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? or were you immersed into the name of Paul?
046	1CO	001	014	I thank God that I immersed none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;
046	1CO	001	015	that no one may say that I immersed into my own name.
046	1CO	001	016	I did, indeed, immerse the household of Stephanus; besides, I know not whether I immersed any other.
046	1CO	001	017	For Christ sent me not to immerse, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of speech, lest the cross of the Christ should be deprived of its power.
046	1CO	001	018	For the preaching of the cross is to those who perish, foolishness; but to us who are saved, it is the power of God.
046	1CO	001	019	For it is written: I will destroy the wisdom of the wise; and I will set aside the understanding of the prudent.
046	1CO	001	020	Where is the wise man? Where is the scribe? Where is the disputer of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?
046	1CO	001	021	For, since in the wisdom of God, the world, by its wisdom, knew not God, it has pleased God, through the foolishness of what is preached, to save those who believe.
046	1CO	001	022	For the Jews ask for a sign, and the Greeks seek for wisdom;
046	1CO	001	023	but we preach Christ crucified; to the Jews, indeed, a stumbling-block, and to the Greeks, foolishness:
046	1CO	001	024	but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ, the power of God, and the wisdom of God.
046	1CO	001	025	For the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.
046	1CO	001	026	For you see your calling, brethren, that not many wise men according to the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble call you;
046	1CO	001	027	but God has chosen the foolish things of the world, that he may bring to shame the wise; and the weak things of the world has God chosen, that he may put to shame the strong;
046	1CO	001	028	and the ignoble things of the world, and the things that are despised, has God chosen, and the things that are not, that he might bring to nought things that are;
046	1CO	001	029	that no flesh should glory in his presence.
046	1CO	001	030	But of him are you in Christ Jesus, who has become to us, from God, wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption;
046	1CO	001	031	that, as it is written: He that glories, let him glory in the Lord.
046	1CO	002	001	And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellence of speech or of wisdom, declaring to you the testimony of God.
046	1CO	002	002	For I determined not to know any thing among you but Jesus Christ, and him crucified.
046	1CO	002	003	And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling:
046	1CO	002	004	and my speech and my preaching were not in persuasive words of man’s wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power,
046	1CO	002	005	that your faith might not be in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.
046	1CO	002	006	Yet we speak wisdom among the perfect; but not the wisdom of this age, nor of the rulers of this age, who are brought to nought:
046	1CO	002	007	but we speak God’s wisdom in a mystery, even that which had been hidden, which God predestined before the ages, for our glory,
046	1CO	002	008	which none of the rulers of this age knew; for, had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory.
046	1CO	002	009	But, as it is written: Eye has not seen, and ear has not heard, and into the heart of man have not entered the things which God has prepared for them that love him.
046	1CO	002	010	But God has revealed them to us through his Spirit; for the Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God.
046	1CO	002	011	For what man knows the things of man, but the spirit of man which is in him? Even so, the things of God no one knows, but the Spirit of God.
046	1CO	002	012	And we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is from God, that we may know the things that are freely given to us by God:
046	1CO	002	013	which things also we speak, not in words taught by man’s wisdom, but in words taught by the Spirit, comparing spiritual things with spiritual things.
046	1CO	002	014	But an animal man receives not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he can not know them, because they are spiritually discerned.
046	1CO	002	015	But the spiritual man discerns all things; yet he himself is discerned by no one.
046	1CO	002	016	For who has known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.
046	1CO	003	001	And I, brethren, was not able to speak to you, as to spiritual men, but as to those who are carnal, as to babes in Christ.
046	1CO	003	002	I fed you with milk, not with meat; for you were not then able to bear it; indeed, not even now are you able;
046	1CO	003	003	for you are yet carnal. For, since envy and strife and divisions are among you, are you not carnal, and do you not walk as men?
046	1CO	003	004	For when one says, I am of Paul, and another, I of Apollos, are you not carnal?
046	1CO	003	005	Who, then, is Paul? and who is Apollos? Ministers by whom you have believed, even as the Lord gave to each one.
046	1CO	003	006	I planted, Apollos watered: but God made to grow.
046	1CO	003	007	So, neither he that plants nor he that waters is any thing: but God that makes to grow.
046	1CO	003	008	But he that plants and he that waters are one; and each one shall receive his own reward, according to his own labor.
046	1CO	003	009	For we are fellow-laborers for God: you are God’s field, you are God’s building.
046	1CO	003	010	According to the grace of God that is given to me, as a wise master-builder, I have laid the foundation, and another builds on this. But let every one take heed how he builds on this.
046	1CO	003	011	For other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid, which, is Jesus Christ.
046	1CO	003	012	If any man builds on this foundation, gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble,
046	1CO	003	013	each man’s work shall be made manifest; for the day shall make it manifest, for it is revealed with fire: and the fire shall try each man’s work, what sort it is.
046	1CO	003	014	If any man’s work abide, which he builds on this, he shall receive a reward;
046	1CO	003	015	if any man’s work be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved, yet so, as through fire.
046	1CO	003	016	Know you not that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?
046	1CO	003	017	If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy: for the temple of God is holy, which temple you are.
046	1CO	003	018	Let no one deceive himself: if any one among you is considered as wise in this age, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.
046	1CO	003	019	For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God; for it is written: He takes the wise in their own craftiness.
046	1CO	003	020	And again: The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.
046	1CO	003	021	Therefore, let no one glory in men; for all things are yours,
046	1CO	003	022	whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come, all are yours:
046	1CO	003	023	and you are Christ’s: and Christ is God’s.
046	1CO	004	001	Let each one so think of us as ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.
046	1CO	004	002	Now it is required in stewards, that each one be found faithful.
046	1CO	004	003	But with me, it matters very little, that I should be judged by you, or by the judgment of men: indeed, I do not judge myself.
046	1CO	004	004	For, though I am conscious of no wrong, yet by this I am not justified: but he that judges me is the Lord.
046	1CO	004	005	So, then, judge nothing before the time, till the Lord comes, who will bring to light the secret works of darkness, and will also make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall each have his praise from God.
046	1CO	004	006	And these things, brethren, I have, in figure, applied to myself and Apollos, for your sakes, that you may learn in us not to think more of teachers than what has been written; and that no one of you be vain of one to the injury of another.
046	1CO	004	007	For who gave you distinction, as a teacher? And what have you as a teacher, that you did not receive? And if you received it, why do you boast, as if you had not received it?
046	1CO	004	008	You, Corinthians, are already full; you are already rich; you have reigned as kings independently of us. And that you did indeed reign, that we also might reign with you!
046	1CO	004	009	For I think that God has appointed us the apostles, to the lowest place, as under sentence of death; for we have become a spectacle to the world, both to angels and to men.
046	1CO	004	010	We are fools for Christ’s sake, but you are wise in Christ; we are weak, but you are strong; you are honored, but we are despised.
046	1CO	004	011	Even to this present hour we both hunger and thirst, and are poorly clothed, and are maltreated, and wander about without a home,
046	1CO	004	012	and labor, working with our own hands. When reviled, we bless; when persecuted, we endure;
046	1CO	004	013	when defamed, we entreat; we have become like the outcasts of the world, the offscouring of all things to this day.
046	1CO	004	014	I do not write these things that I may make you ashamed; but as my beloved children I admonish you.
046	1CO	004	015	For though you have ten thousand tutors in Christ, yet you have not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.
046	1CO	004	016	I exhort you, therefore, be imitators of me.
046	1CO	004	017	For this reason have I sent to you Timothy, who is my son, beloved and faithful in the Lord, that he may remind you of my ways that are in Christ, as I teach everywhere, in every church.
046	1CO	004	018	Now, some have become arrogant, as if I were not coming to you;
046	1CO	004	019	but I will come to you quickly, if the Lord will; and I will know, not the speech of those who have become arrogant, but the power.
046	1CO	004	020	For the kingdom of God is not in speech, but in power.
046	1CO	004	021	What do you wish? Shall I come to you with a rod, or in love, and in the spirit of gentleness?
046	1CO	005	001	It is generally reported that there is lewdness among you; and such lewdness as is not even mentioned among the Gentiles―that a certain one has his father’s wife.
046	1CO	005	002	And you are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that has done this deed might be taken from among you.
046	1CO	005	003	For I, indeed, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have already, as if I were present, judged him that has so done this thing;
046	1CO	005	004	in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when you and my spirit have come together, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,
046	1CO	005	005	that we deliver such a one over to Satan, for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.
046	1CO	005	006	Your boasting is not good; know you not that a little leaven leavens the whole mass?
046	1CO	005	007	Purge out the old leaven, that you may be a new mass, as you are without leaven; for Christ, our passover, has been sacrificed for us.
046	1CO	005	008	Therefore, let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, nor with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of purity and truth.
046	1CO	005	009	I have written to you in the letter not to associate with lewd persons;
046	1CO	005	010	yet without the lest allusion to the lewd, or the covetous, or the extortioners, or the idolaters of this world; for then you must go out of the world;
046	1CO	005	011	but now I write to you, not to associate with any one professing to be a brother, if he is lewd or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortioner: with such a one not even to eat.
046	1CO	005	012	For what right have I to judge those who are without? Do you not judge those who are within?
046	1CO	005	013	But God will judge those who are without. So then judge, and put away that wicked man from among you.
046	1CO	006	001	Does any one of you that has a matter of dispute with another, presume to be judged before the unrighteous, and not before the saints?
046	1CO	006	002	Know you not that the saints shall judge the world? And if the world is to be judged by you, are you unworthy to decide concerning the smallest matters?
046	1CO	006	003	Know you not that we shall judge angels? Much more then, things pertaining to this life.
046	1CO	006	004	If, then, you have controversies pertaining to things of this life, set them to judge who are the least esteemed in the church.
046	1CO	006	005	I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not among you a wise man, not even one, who shall be able to arbitrate between his brethren?
046	1CO	006	006	But brother goes to law with brother, and this before the unbelievers?
046	1CO	006	007	Now, certainly, you are altogether in fault, that you have law-suits with one another. Why do you not rather suffer injustice? Why do you not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?
046	1CO	006	008	But you act unjustly, and you defraud, and that, too, your brethren.
046	1CO	006	009	Know you not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived; neither lewd persons, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor catamites, nor sodomites,
046	1CO	006	010	nor thieves, nor defrauders, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.
046	1CO	006	011	And such were some of you: but you are washed, but you are sanctified, but you are justified, in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.
046	1CO	006	012	All meats are lawful for me: but all are not profitable. All are lawful for me; but I will not be brought under subjection by any.
046	1CO	006	013	Meats for the stomach, and the stomach for meats; but God will destroy both it and them. But the body is not for lewdness, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body:
046	1CO	006	014	and God has raised, up the Lord, and will also raise us up by his power.
046	1CO	006	015	Know you not that your bodies are the members of Christ? Shall I, then, take the members of the Christ, and make them the members of a harlot? It must not be.
046	1CO	006	016	Know you not that he that is joined to a harlot, is one body? For the two, says the scripture, shall be one flesh.
046	1CO	006	017	But he that is joined to the Lord, is one spirit.
046	1CO	006	018	Shun lewdness. Every sin that a man commits, is without the body; but he that is guilty of lewdness sins against his own body.
046	1CO	006	019	Know you not that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit, which you have from God, and that you are not your own?
046	1CO	006	020	For you have been bought with a price: therefore, glorify God in your body.
046	1CO	007	001	Now concerning the things of which you wrote to me, it is good for a man not to touch a woman.
046	1CO	007	002	But, to avoid lewd practices, let every man have his own wife, and every woman her own husband.
046	1CO	007	003	Let the husband render to the wife that which is due, and likewise, also, the wife to the husband.
046	1CO	007	004	The wife has not power over her own body, but the husband; likewise, also, the husband has not power over his own body, but the wife.
046	1CO	007	005	Debar not one another, unless by agreement for a time, that you may have leisure for prayer; and come together again, lest Satan tempt you through your incontinence.
046	1CO	007	006	But this I say by permission, not by commandment:
046	1CO	007	007	for I could wish that all men were even as I am myself. But each one has his own gift from God, one in this way, another in that.
046	1CO	007	008	But I say to the unmarried and to the widows: It would be good for them, if they remain as I myself.
046	1CO	007	009	But if they can not be continent, let them marry; for it is better to marry than to burn.
046	1CO	007	010	But to the married I give commandment, not I, but the Lord: Let not the wife leave her husband:
046	1CO	007	011	but if she leave him, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband: and, let not the husband put away his wife.
046	1CO	007	012	But to the rest, I, and not the Lord, say: If any brother has a wife that believes not, and she is well pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.
046	1CO	007	013	And if any woman has a husband that believes not, and he is well pleased to dwell with her, let her not put him away.
046	1CO	007	014	For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband; for if not, then are your children unclean; but now they are holy.
046	1CO	007	015	But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart; the brother or sister is not bound in such cases. But God has called us to live in peace.
046	1CO	007	016	For how do you know, O wife, but that you may save your husband? Or how do you know, husband, but that you may save your wife?
046	1CO	007	017	But as God has assigned a place to every one, as the Lord has called every one, so let him continue to live: and so do I command in all the churches.
046	1CO	007	018	Has any one been called that had been circumcised? Let him not seek to remove the mark of circumcision. Has any one been called that had not been circumcised? Let him not be circumcised,
046	1CO	007	019	Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing; but the keeping of the commandments of God is our aim.
046	1CO	007	020	Let every one remain in that condition in which he was, when called.
046	1CO	007	021	Were you a servant when you were called? Care not for it. But if you can become free, rather enjoy your freedom.
046	1CO	007	022	For he that is in the Lord, having been called when a servant, is the Lord’s freedman. Likewise, also, the freeman who has been called, is Christ’s servant.
046	1CO	007	023	You have been bought with a price; become not the servants of men.
046	1CO	007	024	Brethren, let every one, in whatever condition he is called, abide in this with God.
046	1CO	007	025	But with respect to virgins, I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment as one that is enabled, by the mercy of the Lord, to be faithful.
046	1CO	007	026	I think, then, that this is good for the present affliction―that it is good for a man to be as he is.
046	1CO	007	027	Are you bound to a wife? Seek not a separation. Are you loosed from a wife? Seek not a wife.
046	1CO	007	028	But if you should marry, you would not sin. And if a virgin should marry, she would not sin. But such will have affliction in the flesh. But I spare you.
046	1CO	007	029	Now, this I say, brethren, the time is fraught with trials. It remains that those who have wives be as though they had them not;
046	1CO	007	030	and those who weep, as though they wept not; and those who rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and those who buy, as though they possessed not:
046	1CO	007	031	and those who use this world, as not abusing it; for the outward show of this world passes away.
046	1CO	007	032	But I would have you to be without anxiety. The unmarried man is concerned about the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord:
046	1CO	007	033	but he that is married, is concerned about the things of the world, how he may please his wife.
046	1CO	007	034	There is a difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman is concerned about the things of the Lord, that she may be holy in body and in spirit; but she that is married, is concerned about the things of the world, how she may please her husband.
046	1CO	007	035	I speak this for your own profit; not that I would entangle you, but that you may decorously and devotedly wait upon the Lord, without distraction.
046	1CO	007	036	But if any man thinks he would treat his virgin daughter amiss, should she pass the bloom of life, and it is necessary that it should be so, let him do as he pleases, he does not sin; let them ( the suitor and the daughter ) marry.
046	1CO	007	037	But he that stands firm in his purpose, having no necessity to give his daughter in marriage, but has liberty with respect to his own will, and has thus decided in his own heart, that he will keep his daughter a virgin, does well.
046	1CO	007	038	So then, even he that gives her in marriage, does well; but he that gives her not in marriage, does better.
046	1CO	007	039	The wife is bound as long as her husband lives; but if her husband die, she is free to be married to whom she will, only in the Lord.
046	1CO	007	040	But she is happier, in my judgment, if she remains as she is; and I think that I have, also, the Spirit of God.
046	1CO	008	001	Now, with respect to meats offered to idols, we know, (for we all have knowledge: knowledge puffs up with pride, but love edifies.
046	1CO	008	002	If any one thinks that he knows any thing, he knows nothing yet, as he ought to know it:
046	1CO	008	003	but if any one loves God, he is taught by him).
046	1CO	008	004	With respect, then, to the eating of meats offered to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no other God but one.
046	1CO	008	005	For though there are those which are called gods, whether in heaven or on earth, (as there are many gods, and many lords, )
046	1CO	008	006	yet to us there is one God, the Father, from whom are all things, and we for him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.
046	1CO	008	007	But all have not this knowledge; for some, under the persuasion that an idol is a reality, even yet eat meat, as if it were offered to an idol, and their conscience being weak, is defiled.
046	1CO	008	008	But meat commends us not to God; for, neither if we eat are we better, nor, if we eat not, are we worse.
046	1CO	008	009	But take heed, lest, by any means, this right of yours become a stumbling-block to those who are weak.
046	1CO	008	010	For, if any one see you, who have knowledge, reclining at table in an idol’s temple, will not the conscience of him who is weak be emboldened, so that he will eat meats offered to idols?
046	1CO	008	011	and will not the weak brother, for whom Christ died, perish through your knowledge?
046	1CO	008	012	But if you sin in this way against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ.
046	1CO	008	013	For which reason, if meat cause my brother to fall, I will never eat meat, lest I cause my brother to fall.
046	1CO	009	001	Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? Are you not my work in the Lord?
046	1CO	009	002	If I am not an apostle to others, yet certainly I am to you; for the seal of my apostleship are you in the Lord.
046	1CO	009	003	My answer to those who examine me is this:
046	1CO	009	004	Have we not the right to eat and drink?
046	1CO	009	005	Have we not the right to lead about a sister wife, as the other apostles, and the brothers of the Lord, and Cephas?
046	1CO	009	006	Or, have I only, and Barnabas, no right to leave off working?
046	1CO	009	007	What man ever serves as a soldier, at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard, and eats not of its fruit? Or who tends a flock, and eats not of the milk of the flock?
046	1CO	009	008	Do I speak these things as a man? Or does not the law, also, say the same?
046	1CO	009	009	For it is written in the law of Moses: You shall not muzzle the ox that treads out the grain? Has God a care for oxen?
046	1CO	009	010	or does he say it wholly for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, it was written: that he that plows should plow in hope, and that he that thrashes should thrash in hope of partaking.
046	1CO	009	011	If we have sown, for your benefit, things that are spiritual, is it a great thing that we reap your carnal things?
046	1CO	009	012	If others partake of this right over you, should not we rather? But we have not used this right: but we endure all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of the Christ.
046	1CO	009	013	Do you not know that those who are engaged about sacred rites have their living from the temple? and that those who attend upon the altar are partakers with the altar?
046	1CO	009	014	So, also, the Lord has ordained that those who preach the gospel should live by the gospel.
046	1CO	009	015	But I have availed myself of none of these things; nor do I write these things that it should be so done to me. For it would be better for me to die, than that any one should make my boasting vain.
046	1CO	009	016	For though I preach the gospel, I have no cause for boasting; for a necessity is laid upon me; yes, alas for me, if I preach not the gospel.
046	1CO	009	017	For if I do this willingly, I have a reward; but if unwillingly, an apostolic stewardship has been intrusted to me.
046	1CO	009	018	What, then, is my reward? That, while I preach, I may make the gospel of Christ to be without charge, in order that I may not abuse my authority in the gospel.
046	1CO	009	019	For, though I am free from all men, yet have I made myself a servant to all, that I may gain the more.
046	1CO	009	020	And to the Jews, I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews: to those who are under law, as under law, (not being myself under law, ) that I might gain those who are under law;
046	1CO	009	021	to those who are without law, as without law, (not being myself without law to God, but under law to Christ, ) that I might gain those who are without law:
046	1CO	009	022	to the weak I became like one who was weak, that I might gain the weak: I have become all things to all men, that I may, by all means, save some.
046	1CO	009	023	And this I do for the gospel’s sake, that I may share its benefits with you.
046	1CO	009	024	Know you not that all the runners in the race-course run the race, but that one receives the prize? So run, that you may obtain the prize.
046	1CO	009	025	Every combatant in the public games is temperate in all things: they, indeed, that they may obtain a corruptible, but we, that we may obtain an incorruptible crown.
046	1CO	009	026	I, therefore, so run, not as with uncertainty; I so aim my blows, not as one that beats the air;
046	1CO	009	027	but I put my body under severe discipline, and bring it into subjection, lest, after I have preached to others, I myself should be rejected.
046	1CO	010	001	Now, brethren, I do not wish you to be ignorant, that all our fathers were under the cloud, and that all passed through the sea,
046	1CO	010	002	and were all immersed into Moses, in the cloud and in the sea;
046	1CO	010	003	and did all eat the same spiritual food,
046	1CO	010	004	and did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them, and that Rock was the Christ.
046	1CO	010	005	But with the most of them God was not well pleased, for they were overthrown in the wilderness.
046	1CO	010	006	Now these things took place as examples for us, that we should not desire evil things, as they, also, desired.
046	1CO	010	007	Neither be you idolaters, as some of them were, as it is written: Tho people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to engage in idolatrous sport.
046	1CO	010	008	Nor let us be guilty of lewdness, as some of them were guilty, and fell, in one day, twenty-three thousand.
046	1CO	010	009	Nor let us tempt the Christ, as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed by serpents.
046	1CO	010	010	Nor do you murmur, as some of them also murmured, and were destroyed by the destroyer.
046	1CO	010	011	Now all these things happened to them as examples, and they are written for the instruction of us, upon whom the ends of the ages have come.
046	1CO	010	012	Wherefore, let him that thinks he stands, take heed lest he foil.
046	1CO	010	013	No trial has come upon you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tried more than you are able to bear; but he will, with the trial, make a way to escape, so that you be able to bear up under it.
046	1CO	010	014	Wherefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry.
046	1CO	010	015	I speak as to wise men; judge you what I say.
046	1CO	010	016	The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the participation of the blood of the Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the participation of the body of the Christ?
046	1CO	010	017	Because the loaf is one, we, the many, are one body, for we are all partakers of the one loaf.
046	1CO	010	018	Look at Israel according to the flesh: are not those who eat the sacrifices partakers with the altar?
046	1CO	010	019	What, then, do I say? That an idol is any thing? or, that what is sacrificed to an idol is any thing?
046	1CO	010	020	But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons, and not to God. I do not wish you to be partakers with demons.
046	1CO	010	021	You can not drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of demons: you can not be partakers of the table of the Lord, and of the table of demons.
046	1CO	010	022	Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than he?
046	1CO	010	023	All meats are lawful for me; but all are not profitable; all are lawful, but all do not edify.
046	1CO	010	024	Let no one seek his own, but each the welfare of the other.
046	1CO	010	025	Any thing that is sold in the market, eat, asking no questions on account of conscience:
046	1CO	010	026	for the earth and its fullness are the Lord’s.
046	1CO	010	027	If any one of the unbelievers invites you to a feast, and you are disposed to go, eat any thing that is set before you, asking no questions for conscience sake.
046	1CO	010	028	But if any one say to you: This is sacrificed to idols; eat not, for the sake of him that pointed it out, and for conscience sake:
046	1CO	010	029	conscience, I say, not your own, but that of the other. Why, then, is my liberty judged by the conscience of another?
046	1CO	010	030	If I partake with thanksgiving, why am I evil spoken of on account of that for which I give thanks?
046	1CO	010	031	Whether, therefore, you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.
046	1CO	010	032	Give no occasion for stumbling, either to the Jews, or to the Greeks, or to the church of God;
046	1CO	010	033	even as I please all men in all things, not seeking my own good, but that of the many, in order that they may be saved.
046	1CO	011	001	Be imitators of me, as I am of Christ.
046	1CO	011	002	Now, I praise you, brethren, because you remember me in all things, and keep the traditions as I delivered them to you.
046	1CO	011	003	But I wish you to know, that the head of every man is the Christ, and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.
046	1CO	011	004	Every man that prays or prophesies, having his head covered, dishonors his head.
046	1CO	011	005	But every woman that prays or prophesies with her head uncovered, dishonors her head: for it is one and the same as if she was shaved.
046	1CO	011	006	For if a woman has no vail on, let her also be shaved. But if it is a shame to a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her have a vail.
046	1CO	011	007	For a man ought not to vail his head, because he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of the man.
046	1CO	011	008	For the man is not of the woman, but the woman of the man:
046	1CO	011	009	for the man was not created for the woman, but the woman for the man.
046	1CO	011	010	For this reason ought the woman to have a token of subjection on her head, on account of the angels.
046	1CO	011	011	But neither is the woman without the man, nor the: man without the woman, in the Lord.
046	1CO	011	012	For as the woman is of the man, so also is the man by the woman; but all things are of God.
046	1CO	011	013	Judge in yourselves, whether it is becoming that a woman pray to God unvailed.
046	1CO	011	014	Does not nature itself teach you, that, if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him?
046	1CO	011	015	But if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her; for her hair is given to her for a vail.
046	1CO	011	016	But if any one seems to be contentious, we have no such custom, nor have the churches of God.
046	1CO	011	017	But I praise you not in this, which I now mention, that you come together, not for the better, but for the worse.
046	1CO	011	018	For, in the first place, when you come together in the church, I hear that there are schisms among you, and I partly believe it:
046	1CO	011	019	for there must be sects among you, that the approved may be made known among you.
046	1CO	011	020	When, therefore, you come together in one place, it is not to eat the Lord’s supper;
046	1CO	011	021	for each one, in eating, takes before another, his own supper; and one is hungry, and another is drunken.
046	1CO	011	022	What, have you not houses in which to eat and drink? or do you despise the church of God, and put those to shame who have nothing to eat? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you in this? I praise you not.
046	1CO	011	023	For I received from the Lord that which I also delivered to you: That the Lord Jesus, on the night in which he was delivered up, took bread;
046	1CO	011	024	and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said: Take, eat; this is my body, which is broken for you; do this in remembrance of me.
046	1CO	011	025	In like manner also, the cup, after he had supped, saying: This cup is the new covenant in my blood: do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.
046	1CO	011	026	For as often as you eat this bread, and drink this cup, you do show the Lord’s death till he come.
046	1CO	011	027	Wherefore he that eats this bread, or drinks this cup of the Lord, in an improper manner, shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord.
046	1CO	011	028	But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of this bread, and drink of this cup:
046	1CO	011	029	for he that eats and drinks in an improper manner, eats and drinks condemnation to himself, not discerning the Lord’s body.
046	1CO	011	030	For this reason, many among you are weak and sick, and many sleep.
046	1CO	011	031	For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged;
046	1CO	011	032	but being judged, we are chastened by the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.
046	1CO	011	033	Wherefore, my brethren, when you come together to eat, wait for one another:
046	1CO	011	034	and if any one is hungry, let him eat at home, that you come not together for condemnation. But other things I will set in order when I come.
046	1CO	012	001	But concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I do not wish you to be ignorant.
046	1CO	012	002	You know that you were Gentiles, carried away to those dumb idols, as you might be led.
046	1CO	012	003	For this reason, I make known to you, that no one, speaking by the Spirit of God, calls Jesus accursed: and no one can say that Jesus is Lord, but by the Holy Spirit.
046	1CO	012	004	Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit;
046	1CO	012	005	and there are diversities of ministries, but the same Lord;
046	1CO	012	006	and there are diversities of operations, but the same God, who makes them all effectual in all.
046	1CO	012	007	But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to each one, for the good of all.
046	1CO	012	008	For to one is given, by the Spirit, the word of wisdom; to another, the word of knowledge, by the same Spirit;
046	1CO	012	009	to another, faith, by the same Spirit; to another, gifts of healing, by the same Spirit;
046	1CO	012	010	to another, the working of mighty deeds; to another, prophecy; to another, the discerning of spirits; to another, different kinds of tongues; to another, the interpretation of tongues.
046	1CO	012	011	But all these, the one and the same Spirit makes effectual, distributing to each, respectively, as he wills.
046	1CO	012	012	For as the body is one, and has many members, and all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ.
046	1CO	012	013	For by one Spirit we all were immersed into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bond or free; and we all have been made to drink of one Spirit.
046	1CO	012	014	For the body is not one member, but many.
046	1CO	012	015	If the foot shall say: Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body, is it, for this reason, no part of the body?
046	1CO	012	016	And if the ear shall say: Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body, is it, for this reason, no part of the body?
046	1CO	012	017	If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?
046	1CO	012	018	But now God has placed the members, each of them, in the body, as it has pleased him.
046	1CO	012	019	And if they were all one member, where were the body?
046	1CO	012	020	But now there are many members, but one body.
046	1CO	012	021	The eye can not say to the hand: I have no need of you; or again, the head to the feet: I have no need of you.
046	1CO	012	022	But much more are those members of the body necessary, which seem to be more feeble.
046	1CO	012	023	And those members of the body, which, we think, are less honorable, around these we place the more abundant honor; and our uncomely members have the more abundant comeliness:
046	1CO	012	024	for our comely members have no need. But God has so arranged the body, giving more abundant honor to that part which is deficient,
046	1CO	012	025	that there may be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same anxious care, one for another;
046	1CO	012	026	and if one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or if one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.
046	1CO	012	027	Now, you are the body of Christ, and, as individuals, you are members.
046	1CO	012	028	And God has placed some in the church, first, apostles; secondly, prophets; thirdly, teachers; then mighty deeds; then gifts of healing; helps, governments, kinds of tongues.
046	1CO	012	029	Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Are all workers of mighty deeds?
046	1CO	012	030	Have all the gifts of healing? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret?
046	1CO	012	031	But seek earnestly the best gifts; and yet I show you a more excellent way.
046	1CO	013	001	Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I have become as sounding brass, or a clanging cymbal.
046	1CO	013	002	And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not love, I am nothing.
046	1CO	013	003	And though I give all my goods to feed the poor, and though I deliver up my body to be burned, and have not love, I am profited nothing.
046	1CO	013	004	Love suffers long, and is kind; love envies not; love boasts not; is not vain,
046	1CO	013	005	does nothing unbecoming, seeks not her own, is not easily provoked, thinks no evil,
046	1CO	013	006	rejoices not in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth;
046	1CO	013	007	bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.
046	1CO	013	008	Love never fails; but whether there be gifts of prophecy, they shall have an end; or tongues, they shall cease; or knowledge, it shall have an end.
046	1CO	013	009	For we know in part, and we prophesy in part;
046	1CO	013	010	but when that which is perfect has come, then that which is in part shall have an end.
046	1CO	013	011	When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I had the mind of a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childish things.
046	1CO	013	012	Now we see through a mirror, obscurely; but then, face to face; now I know in part, but then shall I know, even as I am known.
046	1CO	013	013	And now abide faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of these is love.
046	1CO	014	001	Cultivate love, and earnestly desire spiritual gifts, but rather that you may prophesy.
046	1CO	014	002	For he that speaks in an unknown tongue, speaks not to men, but to God; for no one understands him: but yet in spirit he speaks mysteries.
046	1CO	014	003	But he that prophesies speaks to men so as to build them up, to exhort and comfort them.
046	1CO	014	004	He that speaks in an unknown tongue, edifies himself; but he that prophesies, edifies the church.
046	1CO	014	005	I am willing, indeed, that you should all speak in tongues, but rather that you should prophesy; for greater is he that prophesies than he that speaks in tongues, unless he interprets, in order that the church may receive instruction.
046	1CO	014	006	Now, brethren, if I come to you speaking in tongues, in what will I profit you, unless I speak to you by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophecy, or by teaching?
046	1CO	014	007	And even lifeless instruments, which produce sound, whether pipe or harp, unless they give a distinction in the notes, how shall that which is piped or harped be known?
046	1CO	014	008	For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who will prepare himself for battle?
046	1CO	014	009	So, also, unless you, with the tongue, utter words that are intelligible, how shall that which is spoken be known? for you will speak into the air.
046	1CO	014	010	There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them is without meaning.
046	1CO	014	011	If, then, I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be to him that speaks a barbarian; and he that speaks will be a barbarian to me.
046	1CO	014	012	So, also, do you, since you greatly desire spiritual gifts, seek to excel to the building up of the church.
046	1CO	014	013	For which reason, let him that speaks in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret.
046	1CO	014	014	For if I pray in an unknown tongue, the spirit which I have prays, but my understanding is unfruitful.
046	1CO	014	015	What, then, is it? I will pray with the spirit which is given to me, and I will pray with my understanding also. I will sing with the spirit that is given to me, and I will sing with my understanding also.
046	1CO	014	016	Otherwise, if you bless with the spirit that is given to you, how will he that occupies the place of the unlearned man say Amen, when you give thanks, since he understands not what you say?
046	1CO	014	017	For you give thanks well, but the other is not edified.
046	1CO	014	018	I thank God that I speak in tongues more than you all.
046	1CO	014	019	Yet in the church I would rather speak five words with my understanding, that I may instruct others, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue.
046	1CO	014	020	Brethren, be not children in understanding: yet, in malice, be childlike; but, in understanding, be full-grown men.
046	1CO	014	021	In the law it is written: Through men of other tongues and other lips will I speak to this people; and not even thus will they hear me, says the Lord.
046	1CO	014	022	Therefore, tongues are for a sign, not to those who believe, but to those who believe not: but prophecy is not for those who believe not, but for those who believe.
046	1CO	014	023	If, then, the whole church come together into the same place, and all speak in tongues, and there come in unlearned men, or unbelievers, will they not say that you are mad?
046	1CO	014	024	But if all prophesy, and there comes in an unbeliever, or an unlearned man, he is convinced by all, he is examined by all,
046	1CO	014	025	and the secrets of his heart are made manifest; and so, falling down on his face, he will worship God, and report that God is really among you.
046	1CO	014	026	What, then, is it, brethren? When you come together, each one of you has a psalm, has something to teach, has an unknown tongue, has a revelation, has an interpretation. Let all things be done for edification.
046	1CO	014	027	If any speak in an unknown tongue, let two, or, at most, three, speak at each meeting, and in succession: and let one interpret.
046	1CO	014	028	But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church: but let him speak to himself, and to God.
046	1CO	014	029	Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others judge:
046	1CO	014	030	and if any thing be revealed to one who is sitting by, let the first be silent.
046	1CO	014	031	For you can all prophesy, one by one, that all may learn, and all may be encouraged;
046	1CO	014	032	and the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets;
046	1CO	014	033	for God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all the assemblies of the saints.
046	1CO	014	034	Let your women keep silence in the assemblies; for they ire not permitted to speak; but they must be in subjection, as also says the law.
046	1CO	014	035	But if they wish to learn any thing, let them ask their own husbands at home; for it is a shame for women to speak in an assembly.
046	1CO	014	036	Has the word of God come forth from you? or did it come to you only?
046	1CO	014	037	If any one has the reputation of being a prophet, or spiritual man, let him acknowledge that the things which I write to you are the commandments of the Lord.
046	1CO	014	038	But if any one be ignorant, let him be ignorant.
046	1CO	014	039	Wherefore, brethren, earnestly desire to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues.
046	1CO	014	040	Let all things be done with propriety, and in good order.
046	1CO	015	001	But I make known to you, brethren, the gospel that I preached to you, which also you received, in which also you stand,
046	1CO	015	002	by which also you are saved, if you hold fast the word which I preached to you, unless you believed in vain.
046	1CO	015	003	For I delivered to you among the first things, that which I also received: That Christ died for our sins, according to the scriptures;
046	1CO	015	004	and that he was buried; and that he rose again the third day, according to the scriptures;
046	1CO	015	005	and that he was seen by Cephas, then by the twelve;
046	1CO	015	006	after that, he was seen by more than five hundred brethren at once, of whom the greater part remain till this day; but some have fallen asleep.
046	1CO	015	007	After that, he was seen by James, then by all the apostles.
046	1CO	015	008	Last of all, he was seen by me also, as one untimely born.
046	1CO	015	009	For I am the least of the apostles, and I am not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.
046	1CO	015	010	But, by the grace of God, I am what I am; and his grace, which was bestowed on me, has not been bestowed in vain: but I have labored more abundantly than they all; not I, however, but the grace of God which was with me.
046	1CO	015	011	Whether, therefore, I or they, so we preached, and so you believed.
046	1CO	015	012	But if Christ is preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you, that a resurrection of the dead is impossible?
046	1CO	015	013	But if a resurrection of the dead is impossible, Christ has not been raised.
046	1CO	015	014	And if Christ has not been raised, then vain is our preaching, and vain also your faith.
046	1CO	015	015	We are, indeed, also found false witnesses of God; for we have testified against God, that he raised the Christ, whom he did not raise, if, indeed, the dead are not raised.
046	1CO	015	016	For if the dead are not raised, Christ has not been raised;
046	1CO	015	017	and if Christ has not been raised, your faith is vain; you are yet in your sins.
046	1CO	015	018	Then, also, those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.
046	1CO	015	019	If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men the most miserable.
046	1CO	015	020	But now, Christ has risen from the dead, the first-fruits of those who slept.
046	1CO	015	021	For, since through man came death, through man comes also the resurrection of the dead.
046	1CO	015	022	For, as in Adam all die, so, also, in Christ shall all be made alive:
046	1CO	015	023	but each in his own order; Christ the first-fruit, afterward, those who are Christ’s at his coming.
046	1CO	015	024	Then comes the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down every principality and authority and power:
046	1CO	015	025	for he must reign till he has put all enemies under his feet.
046	1CO	015	026	The last enemy, Death, shall be destroyed.
046	1CO	015	027	For he has put all things under his feet. But when the scripture says, that all things are put under him, it is evident that he is excepted, who did put all things under him.
046	1CO	015	028	And when all things shall have been put under him, then, also, shall the Son himself be subjected to him that did put all things under him, that God may be the all in all.
046	1CO	015	029	For else, what shall those do, who are immersed for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? Why, then, are they immersed for the dead?
046	1CO	015	030	And why are we in danger every hour?
046	1CO	015	031	I protest, by the joy which I have over you in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.
046	1CO	015	032	If, to speak as a man, I have fought with wild beasts at Ephesus, what advantage is it to me, if the dead rise not? Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die.
046	1CO	015	033	Be not deceived: Evil communications corrupt good manners.
046	1CO	015	034	Awake, as you should, to soberness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God. I speak this to your shame.
046	1CO	015	035	But some one will say: How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?
046	1CO	015	036	Thoughtless man! That which you sow is not made alive, unless it die;
046	1CO	015	037	and as to that which you sow, you sow not the body that shall be produced, but the naked grain, it may be of wheat, or of some other grain:
046	1CO	015	038	but God gives it a body, as it pleases him; and to every seed, its proper body.
046	1CO	015	039	All flesh is not the same flesh; but there is one flesh of men, another of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds.
046	1CO	015	040	There are also bodies celestial, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and that of the terrestrial is another.
046	1CO	015	041	There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for star differs from star in glory.
046	1CO	015	042	So, also, is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption:
046	1CO	015	043	it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power:
046	1CO	015	044	it is sown an animal body, it is raised a spiritual body. There is an animal body, and there is a spiritual body.
046	1CO	015	045	So, also, it is written: The first man Adam became a living soul, the last Adam a life-giving spirit.
046	1CO	015	046	But that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is animal; and afterward that which is spiritual.
046	1CO	015	047	The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man, the Lord from heaven.
046	1CO	015	048	As the earthy man was, such also are the earthy; and as the heavenly man is, such also shall the heavenly be.
046	1CO	015	049	And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.
046	1CO	015	050	But this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood can not inherit the kingdom of God, nor does corruption inherit incorruption.
046	1CO	015	051	Behold, I declare to you a mystery. We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed
046	1CO	015	052	in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet: For the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.
046	1CO	015	053	For this corruptible body must put on incorruptibility; and this mortal body must put on immortality.
046	1CO	015	054	And when this corruptible body shall have put on incorruptibility, and this mortal body shall have put on immortality, then shall come to pass the word that is written: Death is swallowed up in victory.
046	1CO	015	055	O Death, where is thy sting? O Hades, where is thy victory?
046	1CO	015	056	The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.
046	1CO	015	057	But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
046	1CO	015	058	Therefore, my beloved brethren, be firm, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord; for you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.
046	1CO	016	001	As it respects the collection which is for the saints, as I have given orders to the churches of Galatia, so also do you.
046	1CO	016	002	On the first day of the week, let each of you lay by him, and treasure up as he has prospered, that there may be no collections when I come.
046	1CO	016	003	And when I come, whatever persons you approve, I will send with letters to carry your favor to Jerusalem.
046	1CO	016	004	And if it be proper that I also should go, they shall go with me.
046	1CO	016	005	Now I will come to you, when I have passed through Macedonia, for I intend to go through Macedonia;
046	1CO	016	006	and perhaps I may abide with you, or even spend the winter, that you may conduct me on my way to whatever place I may go.
046	1CO	016	007	For I do not wish to see you now in passing; for I hope to spend some time with you, if the Lord permit.
046	1CO	016	008	But I will continue in Ephesus till Pentecost:
046	1CO	016	009	for a great and effective door is opened to me, and there are many adversaries.
046	1CO	016	010	If Timothy come, see that he be with you without fear: for he works the work of the Lord, as I also do.
046	1CO	016	011	Therefore, let no one despise him; but conduct him forth in peace, that he may come to me: for I look for him with the brethren.
046	1CO	016	012	As it respects Apollos my brother, I urged him much to go to you with the brethren, yet he was not at all inclined to go now; but he will go when he has a suitable time.
046	1CO	016	013	Be watchful, stand fast in the faith, be men, be resolute.
046	1CO	016	014	Let every thing be done by you in love.
046	1CO	016	015	I beseech you, brethren, (you know the house of Stephanas, that they are the first-fruits of Achaia, and that they have devoted themselves to the ministry of the saints, )
046	1CO	016	016	that you submit yourselves to such, and to every one that works and labors with us.
046	1CO	016	017	I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus; for they have supplied what was wanting on your part:
046	1CO	016	018	for they have refreshed my spirit, and yours. There fore, acknowledge such.
046	1CO	016	019	The churches of Asia salute you: Aquila and Priscilla, with the church that is in their house, send you many salutations in the Lord.
046	1CO	016	020	All the brethren salute you. Salute one another with a holy kiss.
046	1CO	016	021	The salutation of me, Paul, with my own hand.
046	1CO	016	022	If any one loves not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be accursed. The Lord comes.
046	1CO	016	023	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
046	1CO	016	024	My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.

# BOOK	047	2CO	2 Corinthians	2 Corinthians
047	2CO	001	001	Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, by the will of God, and Timothy my brother, to the church of God which is in Corinth, with all the saints that are in all Achaia:
047	2CO	001	002	grace be to you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
047	2CO	001	003	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort,
047	2CO	001	004	who con soles us in all our afflictions, so that we are able to comfort those who are in any affliction, with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God.
047	2CO	001	005	For as the sufferings for the Christ abound in us, so also through Christ abounds our consolation.
047	2CO	001	006	And if we are afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation, which salvation is effected by your patient endurance of the same sufferings that we also suffer; (and our hope in you is steadfast; ) or if we are consoled, it is for your comfort and salvation;
047	2CO	001	007	because we know, that as you are partakers of the sufferings, so also you shall be partakers of the comfort.
047	2CO	001	008	For we do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning our affliction which came upon us in Asia, that we were exceedingly oppressed, beyond our strength, so that we despaired even of life.
047	2CO	001	009	But we have in ourselves the sentence of death, that we may not trust in ourselves, but in God, who raises the dead;
047	2CO	001	010	who delivered us from so great a death, and does still deliver us: in whom we have confidence, that he will continue to deliver us,
047	2CO	001	011	if you also unite in prayer for our aid, that the favor bestowed on us, through the intercession of many persons, may cause thanks to be given by many for us.
047	2CO	001	012	For the ground of our rejoicing is this: the testimony of our conscience that we have lived in the world more―abundantly, indeed, for you―in sincerity and godly purity, not in carnal wisdom, but in the grace of God.
047	2CO	001	013	For we write to you nothing else than what you recognize, or even acknowledge; and which I hope you will acknowledge to the end;
047	2CO	001	014	as some of you also acknowledge us, that we are the cause of your rejoicing, even as you, also, are of ours, in the day of the Lord Jesus.
047	2CO	001	015	And in this confidence I intended to go to you before, that you might have a second benefit;
047	2CO	001	016	and by you, to pass through into Macedonia, and to come again to you from Macedonia, and be conducted by you into Judea.
047	2CO	001	017	In forming this purpose, did I, therefore, behave with levity? or do I purpose what I purpose, according to the flesh, that there may be with me, yes yes, and no, no?
047	2CO	001	018	But God is true; for our preaching to you was not yes and no:
047	2CO	001	019	for the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, by me and Sylvanus and Timothy, was not yes and no, but in him was yes.
047	2CO	001	020	For whatever promises of God there are, are in him yes, and in him amen, to the glory of God by us.
047	2CO	001	021	For he who establishes us with you in Christ, and has anointed us, is God,
047	2CO	001	022	who has also set his seal upon us, and given us the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.
047	2CO	001	023	But I call on God as a witness against my soul, that wishing to spare you, I did not go to Corinth;
047	2CO	001	024	not that we are lords over your faith, but fellow-workers for your joy: for by faith you stand.
047	2CO	002	001	But I determined this in myself, that with sorrow I would not again come to you:
047	2CO	002	002	for if I cause you to grieve, who is he that makes me glad, but he that is made sorry by me?
047	2CO	002	003	And I wrote to you this very thing, that, on coming to you, I might not have sorrow from those from whom I ought to receive joy; because I have confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.
047	2CO	002	004	For out of much affliction and distress of heart, I wrote to you with many tears: not that you might be grieved, but that you might know the love which I have more abundantly for you.
047	2CO	002	005	But if any one has caused grief, he has grieved, not me only, but, in some measure―not to speak harshly―all of you.
047	2CO	002	006	Sufficient for such a one is the punishment, which was inflicted by the greater number:
047	2CO	002	007	so that, on the other hand, you should rather forgive and comfort him, lest such a one should be swallowed up in too much sorrow.
047	2CO	002	008	Wherefore, I exhort you to give him an assurance of your love.
047	2CO	002	009	For I wrote to you for this purpose also, that I might have a sure proof from you, whether you are obedient in all things.
047	2CO	002	010	Whom you forgive any thing, I forgive it also: for what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven any thing, I have forgiven for your sake, in the person of Christ,
047	2CO	002	011	lest an advantage should be taken of us by Satan; for we are not ignorant of his devices.
047	2CO	002	012	And when I came to Troas to preach the gospel of the Christ, and a door was opened to me in the Lord,
047	2CO	002	013	I had no rest in my spirit, because I did not find Titus my brother; but I took leave of them, and went into Macedonia.
047	2CO	002	014	Now, thanks be to God, who always causes us to triumph in the Christ, and sheds in every place, by us, the fragrance of the knowledge of himself.
047	2CO	002	015	For, through God, we are a sweet odor of Christ, among the saved, and among the lost:
047	2CO	002	016	to the one, we are the odor of death ending in death; to the other, the odor of life ending in life: and who is sufficient for these things?
047	2CO	002	017	For we do not, as the many, adulterate the word of God; but, as from sincerity, but, as from God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.
047	2CO	003	001	Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or do we need, as some do, letters of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you?
047	2CO	003	002	You are our letter, written in our hearts, known and read by all men;
047	2CO	003	003	you are well known to be a letter of Christ, written by us as his ministers, not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God, not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.
047	2CO	003	004	Now, confidence such as this we have, through the Christ, toward God;
047	2CO	003	005	not that we are able, of ourselves, to devise anything, as from ourselves; but our ability is from God,
047	2CO	003	006	who has made us able ministers of the new covenant, not of letter, but of spirit: for the letter kills, but the spirit makes alive.
047	2CO	003	007	For if the ministering of death, by means of a covenant that was written and engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the sons of Israel could not look steadily at the face of Moses, on account of the glory of his face, which glory was to come to an end:
047	2CO	003	008	how shall not the ministering of the spirit be more glorious?
047	2CO	003	009	For if the ministering of condemnation be glory, much more does the ministering of righteousness surpass in glory.
047	2CO	003	010	For that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, because of the glory that surpasses.
047	2CO	003	011	For if that which was to come to an end was glorious, much more that which is to remain is glorious.
047	2CO	003	012	Since then we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech,
047	2CO	003	013	and do not as Moses did, who put a vail over his face, so that the sons of Israel could not steadily look to the end of that which was to come to an end.
047	2CO	003	014	But their minds were blinded: for till this day, in the reading of the old covenant, the same vail remains not taken away, which vail is removed in Christ.
047	2CO	003	015	But to this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon their heart:
047	2CO	003	016	but whenever their heart shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be taken away.
047	2CO	003	017	Now the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.
047	2CO	003	018	And we all, with unvailed face, reflecting the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image, from glory to glory, even as by the Lord the Spirit.
047	2CO	004	001	Wherefore, having this ministry, inasmuch as we have received mercy, we faint not;
047	2CO	004	002	but we have renounced the secret works of shame, not walking in craftiness, nor adulterating the word of God; but, by the manifestation of the truth, commending ourselves to every man’s conscience in the sight of God.
047	2CO	004	003	But if our gospel is vailed, it is vailed among the lost,
047	2CO	004	004	whose unbelieving minds the god of this age has darkened, so that the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should not shine to them.
047	2CO	004	005	For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord, and ourselves your servants, for Jesus sake.
047	2CO	004	006	Because God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, has shined in our hearts, to give the light of the glorious knowledge of God in the person of Jesus Christ.
047	2CO	004	007	But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the exceeding greatness of the power may be God’s and not our own.
047	2CO	004	008	We are pressed on all sides, yet not restrained; perplexed, but not in despair;
047	2CO	004	009	persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;
047	2CO	004	010	always bearing about in our body the violent death of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may be made manifest in our body.
047	2CO	004	011	For we who live are continually delivered up to death for Jesus sake, that the life also of Jesus may be made manifest in our mortal flesh.
047	2CO	004	012	So, then, death is active in us, but life in you.
047	2CO	004	013	But, having the same spirit of faith, according to that which is written, I believed, and for this reason I have spoken; we also believe, and for this reason we speak,
047	2CO	004	014	knowing that he who raised up the Lord Jesus will raise us up also by Jesus, and present us together with you.
047	2CO	004	015	For all these afflictions are for your sakes, that the favor which abounds to me, may, through the thanksgiving of the many, abound richly to the glory of God.
047	2CO	004	016	For this reason we faint not: but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.
047	2CO	004	017	For our present light affliction works out for us an eternal fullness of glory, excelling all excellence,
047	2CO	004	018	while we look not at the things that are seen, but at the things that are not seen: for the things seen are temporal; but the things not seen are eternal.
047	2CO	005	001	For we know that if our earthly house, which is but a tent, should be destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.
047	2CO	005	002	For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house that is from heaven,
047	2CO	005	003	since, having been clothed, we shall not be found naked.
047	2CO	005	004	For we who are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened, not because we wish to be unclothed, but clothed upon, that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life.
047	2CO	005	005	Now, he that has formed us for this very thing is God, who also has given us the earnest of the Spirit.
047	2CO	005	006	Therefore, we are always confident, especially since we know that, while living in the body, we are absent from the Lord:
047	2CO	005	007	for we walk by faith, not by sight:
047	2CO	005	008	we are confident, indeed, and would be pleased rather to depart from the body, and to dwell with the Lord.
047	2CO	005	009	For this reason we also endeavor, whether we remain in the body or depart from it, to be acceptable to him.
047	2CO	005	010	For we must all appear before the judgment-seat of Christ, that each may receive his reward for the things done in his body, according to what he has done, whether good or evil.
047	2CO	005	011	Knowing, then, the fearful judgment of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest to God. I hope, indeed, that we are also made manifest in your consciences.
047	2CO	005	012	We do not again commend ourselves to you, but give you an occasion to boast of us, that you may be able to answer those who glory in appearance, and not in heart.
047	2CO	005	013	For if we be beside ourselves, it is for God; or, if we be of sound mind, it is for you.
047	2CO	005	014	For the love of Christ constrains us, because we have this judgment―that if one died for all, then have all died:
047	2CO	005	015	and he died for all, that those who live should no more live for themselves, but for him who died for them, and rose again.
047	2CO	005	016	So, then, we henceforth know no man according to the flesh; if, indeed, we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we no longer thus know him.
047	2CO	005	017	So, then, if any man is in Christ, he is a new creature; the old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new.
047	2CO	005	018	And all these things are from God, who has reconciled us to himself through Jesus Christ, and has given to us the ministry of reconciliation;
047	2CO	005	019	that is, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, not charging their offenses to them, and he has committed to us the word of reconciliation.
047	2CO	005	020	Therefore, we act as ambassadors for Christ, as though God entreated through us; we beseech in Christ’s stead, be reconciled to God:
047	2CO	005	021	for he has made him, who knew no sin, a sin-offering for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in him.
047	2CO	006	001	As co-workers with him, we beseech you, that you receive not the grace of God in vain:
047	2CO	006	002	(for he says: I have heard thee in an acceptable time, and in the day of salvation I have helped thee. Behold, now is the acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation: )
047	2CO	006	003	for we put no stumbling-block in any man’s way, in order that this ministry may not be blamed;
047	2CO	006	004	but in all things we commend ourselves as the ministers of God, in much suffering, in afflictions, in distresses, in straits,
047	2CO	006	005	in stripes, in prisons, in commotions, in labors, in watchings, in fastings;
047	2CO	006	006	by purity, by knowledge, by long forbearance, by kindness, by the Holy Spirit, by love unfeigned,
047	2CO	006	007	by the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,
047	2CO	006	008	by honor and dishonor, by evil report, and good report; as impostors, yet truthful;
047	2CO	006	009	as unknown, yet well-known; as dying, and behold, we live; as chastened, and yet not put to death;
047	2CO	006	010	as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, yet possessing all things.
047	2CO	006	011	Corinthians, our mouth is opened to you, our heart is enlarged:
047	2CO	006	012	you are not straitened in us, but you are straitened in your own affections.
047	2CO	006	013	That you may repay me in like manner, (I speak as to children, ) be you also enlarged.
047	2CO	006	014	Be not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship has righteousness with lawlessness? What communion has light with darkness?
047	2CO	006	015	What agreement has Christ with Belial? What connection has a believer with an unbeliever?
047	2CO	006	016	What has a temple of God in common with one of idols? For you are the temple of the living God, as God has said: I will dwell in them, and walk among them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.
047	2CO	006	017	For this reason, come out from among them, and separate yourselves, says the Lord, and touch not an unclean person, and I will receive you;
047	2CO	006	018	and I will be to you a father, and you shall be to me sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty.
047	2CO	007	001	Therefore, having these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from every pollution of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.
047	2CO	007	002	Regard us cordially; we have wronged no one, we have corrupted no one, we have made gain by no one.
047	2CO	007	003	I do not say this to condemn you; for I have said before, that you are in our hearts, so that we could die with you, and live with you.
047	2CO	007	004	Great is my plainness of speech to you, great is my boasting of you; I am filled with comfort, I am exceedingly joyful in all our affliction.
047	2CO	007	005	For when we came into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest; but we were oppressed on every side: without were battles, within were fears.
047	2CO	007	006	But God, who comforts those who are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus;
047	2CO	007	007	and not only by his coming, but also by the consolation with which he was comforted in you when he told us of your strong affection, your grief, your zeal for me; so that I rejoiced the more.
047	2CO	007	008	For although I caused you sorrow by my letter, I do not regret it, though I did regret it. For I see that the same letter gave you sorrow, though but for a short time.
047	2CO	007	009	Now I rejoice not that you were made sorry, but that you sorrowed in order to repentance. For you sorrowed in a way acceptable to God, that you might in nothing receive injury from us.
047	2CO	007	010	For godly sorrow works repentance not to be regretted, which leads to salvation: but the sorrow of the world works death.
047	2CO	007	011	For behold this very thing, that you sorrowed in a godly manner; what earnestness it produced in you; what defense of yourselves; what indignation; what fear; what strong affection; what zeal; what assertion of right. In all respects you have shown yourselves to be blameless in this matter.
047	2CO	007	012	Therefore, though I wrote to you, it was not on account of him who did the wrong, nor on account of him who received the wrong; but that our diligent care for you, in the sight of God, might be made manifest to you.
047	2CO	007	013	For this reason, we have been comforted by means of your comfort: and we rejoiced exceedingly more indeed, on account of the joy of Titus, for his spirit was refreshed by you all.
047	2CO	007	014	For if I boasted of you to him, in any respect, I am not made ashamed; but as I have spoken all things to you in truth, so also has our boasting to Titus been found to be truth:
047	2CO	007	015	and his affection for you is the more abundant, as he remembers the obedience of you all, how you received him with fear and trembling.
047	2CO	007	016	I rejoice that I have confidence in you in all things.
047	2CO	008	001	We make known to you, brethren, God’s gracious gift, which has been given in the churches of Macedonia;
047	2CO	008	002	that under an afflicting trial, their overflowing joy, and their deep poverty, abounded to the riches of their liberality;
047	2CO	008	003	for I testify that according to their power, and beyond their power, they gave voluntarily,
047	2CO	008	004	beseeching us, with much entreaty, that they might give, and take part in the ministering to the saints;
047	2CO	008	005	and they did this, not only as we had hoped, but they gave themselves first to the Lord, and then to us, through the will of God;
047	2CO	008	006	so that we exhorted Titus, that, as he had previously begun, so he would bring to an end this gift among you also.
047	2CO	008	007	Now as you excel in every thing, in faith, and in speech, and in knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love for us, see that you excel in this gift also.
047	2CO	008	008	I do not speak this as a commandment, but on account of the zeal of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love.
047	2CO	008	009	For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet, for your sakes, he became poor, that you, through his poverty, might become rich.
047	2CO	008	010	And I give my judgment in this matter; for this is profitable for you, who began not only to do, but to show a willing mind, a year ago.
047	2CO	008	011	Now, therefore, perfect also the doing of this; that as there was a readiness of mind to be willing, so also there may be an accomplishment of the doing, out of that which you have.
047	2CO	008	012	For if there is a readiness of mind, one is accepted according to what he has, not according to what he has not.
047	2CO	008	013	For I do not intend that there shall be relief to others, and affliction to you; but that, according to equality, your abundance, at the present time, may supply their wants;
047	2CO	008	014	and that, at a future time, their abundance may supply your wants; that there may be equality,
047	2CO	008	015	as it is written: He that gathered much had nothing over; and he that gathered little did not lack.
047	2CO	008	016	But thanks be to God, who put the same earnest care for you in the heart of Titus:
047	2CO	008	017	for he accepted my exhortation, and, being more earnest, he went to you of his own accord.
047	2CO	008	018	And we have sent with him the brother whose praise in the gospel is in all the churches;
047	2CO	008	019	and who, moreover, was chosen by the churches as our fellow-traveler with this gift, which is to be distributed by us to the glory of the Lord himself, and as a declaration of your readiness of mind;
047	2CO	008	020	being careful for this―that no one shall blame us in this abundance, which is ministered by us;
047	2CO	008	021	for we provide what is honorable, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.
047	2CO	008	022	And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have often proved to be diligent in many things, but now much more diligent on account of the strong confidence which he has in you.
047	2CO	008	023	If it is necessary to speak of Titus, he is my partner and fellow-worker for you; if our brethren are spoken of, they are the apostles of the churches, the glory of Christ.
047	2CO	008	024	Therefore, give to them, in the presence of the churches, a proof of your love, and of our boasting of you.
047	2CO	009	001	For of the relief which is for the saints, it is needless for me to write to you.
047	2CO	009	002	For I know your readiness of mind, on account of which I boasted of you to the Macedonians, that Achaia was ready a year ago: and your zeal has incited very many.
047	2CO	009	003	But I have sent the brethren, that our boasting of you in this respect may not be in vain; that you may be ready, as I said:
047	2CO	009	004	lest, possibly, should the Macedonians come with me, and find you unprepared, we (not to say you) might be made ashamed by this same confident boasting.
047	2CO	009	005	Therefore, I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren to go before to you, and make ready beforehand your bounty, which has been so much talked of before, that this might be ready as a bounty, and not as a gift extorted from you.
047	2CO	009	006	But remember this, that he who sows sparingly, shall also reap sparingly; and he who sows bountifully, shall also reap bountifully.
047	2CO	009	007	Let each one give, as he purposes in his heart; not with grief, nor from necessity: for God loves a cheerful giver.
047	2CO	009	008	And God is able to confer every gift upon you abundantly, that you, always having all sufficiency in every thing, may have enough for every good work;
047	2CO	009	009	as it is written: He has scattered abroad; he has given to the poor; his righteousness remains forever.
047	2CO	009	010	Now, he that furnishes seed to the sower will both furnish bread for food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;
047	2CO	009	011	that you may be enriched in every thing, for all liberality which produces through us thanksgiving to God;
047	2CO	009	012	because the administration of this service not only supplies the wants of the saints, but also abounds in many thanksgivings to God;
047	2CO	009	013	(since through the proof which this service gives, they glorify God for your acknowledged subjection to the gospel of Christ, and for the liberality of your contribution for them, and for all; )
047	2CO	009	014	and in their prayer for you, since they have strong affection for you on account of the eminent grace of God that is in you.
047	2CO	009	015	Thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift.
047	2CO	010	001	Now I, the same Paul, who, when present among you, am timid, but when absent, am bold toward you, entreat you, by the mildness and gentleness of Christ;
047	2CO	010	002	I, indeed, beseech you, that I may not, when present, be bold with that confidence with which I think I shall be bold against some, who think of us as if we walked according to the flesh.
047	2CO	010	003	For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh,
047	2CO	010	004	(for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty, through God, for the overthrowing of strongholds, )
047	2CO	010	005	overthrowing reasonings and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God, and leading captive every thought to the obedience of the Christ,
047	2CO	010	006	and being ready to take vengeance on all disobedience, when your obedience shall have been fully established.
047	2CO	010	007	Do you look on things according to the outward appearance? If any one trusts in himself, that he is Christ’s, let him again reason thus of himself: that as he is Christ’s, so also are we.
047	2CO	010	008	For though I should boast even, somewhat more abundantly of our authority, which the Lord has given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I would not be ashamed:
047	2CO	010	009	that I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters.
047	2CO	010	010	For his letters, says one, are weighty and powerful, but his bodily presence is weak, and his style of speech contemptible.
047	2CO	010	011	Let such a one conclude thus―that such as we are in word, by letters, while absent, such also will we be in deed, when present.
047	2CO	010	012	For we do not presume to rank or compare ourselves with some of those who commend themselves: but they, measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves with themselves, have no understanding.
047	2CO	010	013	But we will not boast ourselves with respect to regions not measured to us; but according to the measure of the line which God, who measures, has appointed for us to reach even to you.
047	2CO	010	014	For we do not stretch ourselves too far, as if we did not come to you: for even as far as to you, have we already come in the gospel of the Christ,
047	2CO	010	015	not boasting ourselves in the labors of others in regions not measured off to us, but having hope that, when your faith is increased, we shall be magnified among you abundantly, according to our line,
047	2CO	010	016	so as to preach the gospel in regions beyond you, and not to boast in regions made ready under another man’s line.
047	2CO	010	017	But let him that boasts, boast in the Lord:
047	2CO	010	018	for he that commends himself is not approved; but he whom the Lord commends.
047	2CO	011	001	I wish you could bear with me a little in my folly; but yet bear with me:
047	2CO	011	002	for I am jealous over you with a godly jealousy: for I have betrothed you to one husband, that I may present you a chaste virgin to Christ.
047	2CO	011	003	But I fear lest, as the serpent deceived Eve by his cunning, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity which pertains to Christ.
047	2CO	011	004	For if he that comes should preach another Jesus, whom we did not preach, or, if you receive another Spirit, which you did not receive, or another gospel, which you have not accepted, you would well bear with him.
047	2CO	011	005	I count myself indeed to be in no respect inferior to the very greatest of the apostles.
047	2CO	011	006	But if I am unpolished in my style of speech, yet I am not so in knowledge. But we have been fully manifested among you in all things.
047	2CO	011	007	Have I committed a sin, in making myself lowly, that you might be exalted, because I preached the gospel to you without cost?
047	2CO	011	008	I robbed other churches, taking wages to do you service: and when I was present with you, and wanted, I was not a burden to any one;
047	2CO	011	009	for the brethren who came from Macedonia supplied my wants; and in every thing I have kept myself from being burdensome to you, and will continue to keep myself.
047	2CO	011	010	As the truth of Christ is in me, this boasting shall not be silenced, in my case, in the regions of Achaia.
047	2CO	011	011	Why? Because I do not love you? God knows.
047	2CO	011	012	But what I am doing I will also continue to do, that I may cut off occasion from those who desire an occasion, that in what they boast, they may be found even as we.
047	2CO	011	013	For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ;
047	2CO	011	014	and no wonder, for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.
047	2CO	011	015	Therefore, it is no great thing if his ministers also transform themselves so as to be like the ministers of righteousness; of such, the end shall be according to their works.
047	2CO	011	016	I say again, let no one think that I am without understanding; but if so, even as one without understanding bear with me, that I also may boast a little.
047	2CO	011	017	What I say, I say not according to the Lord, but as in folly, in this same confidence of boasting.
047	2CO	011	018	Since many boast according to the flesh, I also will boast.
047	2CO	011	019	For it is a pleasure to you to bear with men of no understanding, since you yourselves are wise.
047	2CO	011	020	For you bear it, if one enslave you, if one devour you, if one take from you, if one exalt himself, if one smite you on the face,
047	2CO	011	021	I speak of their reproaches, as if we were weak. In whatever matter any one is bold, (I speak foolishly, ) I also am bold.
047	2CO	011	022	Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they of the posterity of Abraham? So am I.
047	2CO	011	023	Are they ministers of Christ? (I say it foolishly, ) I am above them. In labors more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths often.
047	2CO	011	024	From the Jews, five times I received forty stripes, save one;
047	2CO	011	025	three times I was beaten with rods; once I was stoned; three times I have been shipwrecked; a night and a day I spent in the deep.
047	2CO	011	026	In journeyings often, in perils from rivers, in perils from robbers, in perils from my own race, in perils from the Gentiles, in perils in the city, in perils in the desert, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren;
047	2CO	011	027	in weariness and in toil, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness:
047	2CO	011	028	besides those things which come upon me from other sources, I have a daily concourse of troubles―my anxiety for all the churches.
047	2CO	011	029	Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is led into sin, and I am not incensed?
047	2CO	011	030	If I must boast, I will boast in my infirmities.
047	2CO	011	031	The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is blessed for ever, knows that I do not lie.
047	2CO	011	032	In Damascus, the governor under Aretas the king, guarded the city of the Damascenes, desiring to apprehend me:
047	2CO	011	033	and through a window I was let down in a basket through the wall, and escaped his hands.
047	2CO	012	001	To boast is not suitable for me; I will come to visions and revelations from the Lord.
047	2CO	012	002	I knew a man in Christ fourteen years ago; that such a one (whether in the body, I know not, or out of the body, I know not: God knows; ) was caught away to the third heaven.
047	2CO	012	003	I also know that such a man (whether in the body, or out of the body, I know not: God knows, )
047	2CO	012	004	was caught away to Paradise, and heard words not to be spoken, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.
047	2CO	012	005	Of such a one I will boast; but of myself I will not boast, unless in my infirmities.
047	2CO	012	006	For though I should choose to boast, I would not be void of understanding: for I will speak the truth. But I forbear, lest any one should think of me more than what he sees me to be, or what he hears of me.
047	2CO	012	007	And, lest I should be too much exalted by the excellence of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to buffet me, that I might not be too much exalted.
047	2CO	012	008	With regard to this, I three times entreated the Lord that it might leave me;
047	2CO	012	009	and he said to me: My grace is sufficient for you; for my power is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly, therefore, will I boast in my infirmities, that the power of the Christ may abide upon me.
047	2CO	012	010	For this reason, I take pleasure in infirmities, in outrages, in necessities, in persecutions, in straits, for Christ’s sake. For when I am weak, then am I strong.
047	2CO	012	011	I have become of no understanding; you have compelled me. For I ought to have been commended by you: I am in no respect inferior to the very greatest of the apostles, although I am nothing.
047	2CO	012	012	Truly, the signs of an apostle were worked among you in all patience, in signs and wonders and mighty deeds.
047	2CO	012	013	For what is it in which you were inferior to other churches, unless in this―that I did not burden you? Forgive me this wrong.
047	2CO	012	014	Behold, I am ready the third time to come to you, and I will not burden you: for I seek not yours, but you. For the children ought not to lay up treasure for the parents, but the parents for the children.
047	2CO	012	015	I, indeed, will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved.
047	2CO	012	016	Be it so, indeed; I did not burden you; but being crafty, I caught you by deceit.
047	2CO	012	017	Did I overreach you by any of those whom I sent to you?
047	2CO	012	018	I exhorted Titus, and with him sent the brother. Did Titus overreach you? Did we not walk in the same spirit? Did we not walk in the same steps?
047	2CO	012	019	Do you think again that we offer you a defense of ourselves? We speak all these things before God in Christ, beloved, for your edification.
047	2CO	012	020	For I fear, lest when I come I shall find you not, such as I wish, and I shall be found by you not such as you wish: lest there shall be contentions, envies, excitements, strife, evil speaking, whisperings, party spirit, disorderly conduct:
047	2CO	012	021	lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and I shall mourn over many of those who have already sinned, and have not repented of the uncleanness and lewdness and wantonness which they have committed.
047	2CO	013	001	The third time am I coming to you. By the mouth of two or three witnesses, every matter shall be established.
047	2CO	013	002	I have foretold, and now the second time, as if I was present, though being absent, I foretell to those who have sinned, and to all others, that, if I come again, I will not spare;
047	2CO	013	003	since you seek a proof of Christ’s speaking in me, who toward you is not weak, but who is mighty in you:
047	2CO	013	004	for though he was crucified in weakness, yet he lives by the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you.
047	2CO	013	005	Make trial of yourselves, whether you are in the faith; put yourselves to the proof. Do you not know your own selves, that Christ Jesus is in you? unless you be without proof.
047	2CO	013	006	But I hope that you will know that we are not without proof.
047	2CO	013	007	Yet I pray to God that you may do no evil; not that we may appear as having proof, but that you may do what is good, though we be as without proof.
047	2CO	013	008	For we can do nothing against the truth, but we can do something for the truth.
047	2CO	013	009	For we rejoice when we are weak, and you are strong. And we pray also for this―your perfection.
047	2CO	013	010	For this reason, I write these things, while absent, that I may not, when present, use severity, according to the authority which the Lord has given me for edification, and not for destruction.
047	2CO	013	011	Finally, brethren, farewell; be perfect, be comforted, be of the same mind, be at peace; and the God of love and of peace will be with you.
047	2CO	013	012	Salute one another with a holy kiss.
047	2CO	013	013	All the saints salute you.
047	2CO	013	014	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit, be with you all.

# BOOK	048	GAL	Galatians	Galatians
048	GAL	001	001	Paul, an apostle, (not from men, nor by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead, )
048	GAL	001	002	and all the brethren that are with me, to the churches of Galatia:
048	GAL	001	003	grace be to you, and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ,
048	GAL	001	004	who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father,
048	GAL	001	005	to whom be glory from age to age. Amen.
048	GAL	001	006	I am astonished that you are so soon turning away from him that called you into the grace of Christ, to another gospel:
048	GAL	001	007	which is nothing else than that there are some who trouble you, and are determined to pervert the gospel of the Christ.
048	GAL	001	008	But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach to you any other gospel than that which we have preached, let him be accursed.
048	GAL	001	009	As we said before, so even now I say again, if any one preaches to you any other gospel than that which you have received, let him be accursed.
048	GAL	001	010	For, do I now seek the favor of men, or of God? or do I strive to please men? If, indeed, I would still please men, I should not be the servant of Christ.
048	GAL	001	011	But I make known to you, brethren, that the gospel which is preached by me, is not according to man:
048	GAL	001	012	for neither did I receive it from man, nor was it taught me, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.
048	GAL	001	013	For you have heard of my former mode of life in Judaism, that I greatly persecuted the church of God, and laid it waste;
048	GAL	001	014	and I surpassed in Judaism many of my own age and nation, being more exceedingly zealous for the tradition of my fathers.
048	GAL	001	015	But when God, who chose me from my mother’s womb, and called me by his grace, was pleased
048	GAL	001	016	to reveal his Sou in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I at once declined all conference with flesh and blood:
048	GAL	001	017	nor did I go up to Jerusalem, to those who were apostles before me; but I went away into Arabia, and then returned to Damascus.
048	GAL	001	018	Then, after three years, I went up to Jerusalem, in order to become personally acquainted with Peter; and I remained with him fifteen days:
048	GAL	001	019	but of the apostles I saw no other, but James the brother of the Lord.
048	GAL	001	020	With respect to the things which I now write to you, behold, before God I lie not.
048	GAL	001	021	Then, I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia:
048	GAL	001	022	but I was not known, in person, to the churches of Judea which are in Christ.
048	GAL	001	023	They had heard only that he who formerly persecuted us was now preaching the faith which he once destroyed.
048	GAL	001	024	And they glorified God in me.
048	GAL	002	001	Then, fourteen years after, I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and I took Titus also with me.
048	GAL	002	002	And I went up because of a revelation, and communicated to them the gospel that I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to those who are of reputation, lest, by any means, I should run or had run in vain.
048	GAL	002	003	But not even Titus, who was with me, though he was a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised.
048	GAL	002	004	I acted thus indeed on account of false brethren, stealthily brought in, who stole in to spy out our freedom, which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage,
048	GAL	002	005	to whom we yielded in submission, not even for an hour, in order that the truth of the gospel might remain with you.
048	GAL	002	006	But from those who were supposed to be something; (what they were is a matter of no importance to me: God does not accept the person of man; ) they, indeed, who were supposed to be something, communicated no additional truth to me;
048	GAL	002	007	but; on the other hand, seeing that I was intrusted with the gospel of the uncircumcision, as Peter was with that of the circumcision,
048	GAL	002	008	(for he who gave efficiency to Peter, for the apostleship of the circumcision, gave efficiency to me also, as an apostle for the Gentiles, )
048	GAL	002	009	and knowing the grace that was given to me, James and Cephas and John, who seemed to be pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, that we should go to the Gentiles, but they to the circumcision,
048	GAL	002	010	requesting only that we would remember the poor, which same thing I have been diligent in doing.
048	GAL	002	011	But when Peter came to Antioch, I openly opposed him, because he had incurred blame.
048	GAL	002	012	For, before certain persons came from James, he ate with the Gentiles: but, when they had come, he withdrew, and separated himself, because he feared those who were of the circumcision.
048	GAL	002	013	And the other Jews, also, acted hypocritically with him, so that even Barnabas was led away by their hypocrisy.
048	GAL	002	014	But when I saw that they did not walk uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said to Peter, before them all: If you, being a Jew, live after the manner of the Gentiles, and not after the manner of the Jews, why do you compel the Gen tiles to observe Jewish customs?
048	GAL	002	015	We, who are Jews by birth, and not Gentile sinners,
048	GAL	002	016	knowing that a man is not justified by works of law, but by faith in Jesus Christ, even we have believed on Christ Jesus, that we may be justified by faith in Christ, and not by works of law: because, by works of law no flesh shall be justified.
048	GAL	002	017	But if, while we seek to be justified in Christ, we ourselves are also found sinners, is Christ, therefore, the minister of sin? It can not be.
048	GAL	002	018	For if I build again those things which I have destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.
048	GAL	002	019	For, through law, I have died to law, that I might live to God.
048	GAL	002	020	I have been crucified with Christ, yet I live; no longer I, but Christ lives in me. And the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.
048	GAL	002	021	I do not set aside the grace of God: for if righteousness be through law, then Christ has died in vain.
048	GAL	003	001	O thoughtless Galatians, who has bewitched you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ has been plainly set forth crucified?
048	GAL	003	002	This only I wish to learn of you: Did you receive the Spirit by works of law, or by the hearing of faith?
048	GAL	003	003	Are you so thoughtless? After having begun in Spirit, do you make an end in flesh?
048	GAL	003	004	Have you suffered so many things in vain? if, indeed, it be in vain.
048	GAL	003	005	He that supplies to you the Spirit, and works mighty deeds among you, does he this by works of law or by the hearing of faith?
048	GAL	003	006	even as Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness.
048	GAL	003	007	Know, therefore, that those who are of faith are the sons of Abraham.
048	GAL	003	008	For the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached beforehand the gospel to Abraham, saying: In you shall all the nations be blessed.
048	GAL	003	009	So, then, those who are of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.
048	GAL	003	010	For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that does not continue in all things written in the book of the law to do them.
048	GAL	003	011	But that no one is justified by law in the sight of God, is evident: for the just by faith shall live.
048	GAL	003	012	The law, indeed, is not of faith; but he that does these things shall live by them.
048	GAL	003	013	Christ has bought us off from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us: (for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangs on a tree: )
048	GAL	003	014	in order that the blessing of Abraham may come upon the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, that we may receive the promise of the Spirit through the faith.
048	GAL	003	015	Brethren, I speak of things common among men: No one sets a covenant aside, or enjoins any thing additional after it is confirmed, though it be a man’s covenant.
048	GAL	003	016	Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his offspring; he does not say: And to offsprings, as if he spoke of many; but as of one, And to your offspring, which is Christ.
048	GAL	003	017	And this I affirm, that the covenant which had been before confirmed by God with respect to Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, could not annul so as to make the promise of no effect.
048	GAL	003	018	For if the inheritance be by law, it is no longer by promise: but God bestowed it on Abraham by promise.
048	GAL	003	019	What, then, was the purpose of the law? It was added on account of transgressions, (till the offspring should come, to whom the promise was made, ) having been appointed through the service of angels, in the hand of a mediator.
048	GAL	003	020	Now, a mediator for one is impossible; but God is one.
048	GAL	003	021	Is the law, then, against the promises of God? It can not be. For if a law had been given which could have given life, surely righteousness would have been by law.
048	GAL	003	022	But the scripture has shut up all under sin, that the promise by faith in Christ Jesus may be given to those who believe.
048	GAL	003	023	But before the faith came, we were kept under law, being shut up to the faith which was to be revealed.
048	GAL	003	024	So, then, the law was our pedagogue that led us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.
048	GAL	003	025	But since the faith has come, we are no longer under a pedagogue:
048	GAL	003	026	for you are all the sons of God, by faith in Christ Jesus:
048	GAL	003	027	for as many of you as have been immersed into Christ, have put on Christ.
048	GAL	003	028	There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bondman nor freeman, there is neither male nor female: for you are all one in Christ Jesus.
048	GAL	003	029	And if you are Christ’s, then you are Abraham’s posterity, and heirs according to the promise.
048	GAL	004	001	But I say, that the heir, as long as he is a minor, differs in no respect from a servant, though he is owner of all;
048	GAL	004	002	but is under guardians and managers till the time appointed by the father.
048	GAL	004	003	So, also, we, when we were minors, were in bondage under the rudiments of the world.
048	GAL	004	004	But when the fullness of the time came, God sent forth his Son, born of a woman, born under the law,
048	GAL	004	005	that he might buy off those who were under the law, that we might receive the adoption.
048	GAL	004	006	And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.
048	GAL	004	007	So, then, you are no longer a servant, but a son; and if a son, an heir also of God, through Christ.
048	GAL	004	008	But, then, because you knew not God, you were enslaved to those who, by nature, are not gods:
048	GAL	004	009	now, however, after having known God, rather indeed having been known by God, how is it that you are turning back to the weak and beggarly rudiments, to which you desire again to be in bondage, as at first?
048	GAL	004	010	You observe days and months and times and years.
048	GAL	004	011	fear for you, lest I have bestowed labor upon you in vain.
048	GAL	004	012	Brethren, I beseech you, be as I am; because I was as you are. You have injured me in nothing.
048	GAL	004	013	You know that through weakness of the flesh I preached the gospel to you at the first:
048	GAL	004	014	and my trial, which was in my flesh, you did not despise or loathe; but you received me as an angel of God, as Christ Jesus.
048	GAL	004	015	How great, then, was your blessedness! For I testify for you, that, if possible, you would have torn out your eyes, and have given them to me.
048	GAL	004	016	Have I then become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?
048	GAL	004	017	They are ardently attached to you, but not honorably; indeed, they desire to exclude us, that you may be ardently attached to them.
048	GAL	004	018	It is honorable to be ardently attached always, in what is honorable, and not only when I am present with you.
048	GAL	004	019	My little children, for whom I again suffer the pains of gestation, till Christ be formed in you,
048	GAL	004	020	I desire to be present with you now, and to change my tone, for I am in doubt concerning you.
048	GAL	004	021	Tell me, you that desire to be under the law, do you not understand the law?
048	GAL	004	022	For it is written, that Abraham had two sons; one by a bondmaid, and one by a free woman.
048	GAL	004	023	But the one by the bondmaid was born according to the flesh; the other, by the free woman, was by promise.
048	GAL	004	024	These things are allegorized: for these women are the two covenants; the one from the Mount Sinai that brings forth for bondage, which is Hagar.
048	GAL	004	025	For Hagar represents Mount Sinai in Arabia, and corresponds to the present Jerusalem, for she is in bondage with her children.
048	GAL	004	026	But Jerusalem which is above is free; and she is the mother of us all.
048	GAL	004	027	For it is written: Rejoice you barren, that do not bear: break forth and cry aloud, you that travail not: for many more are the children of the deserted, than of her that had the husband of the deserted.
048	GAL	004	028	We, indeed, brethren, like Isaac, are children of promise.
048	GAL	004	029	But as then, he that was born according to the flesh persecuted him that was born according to the Spirit, so even now.
048	GAL	004	030	But what says the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son; for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the free-woman.
048	GAL	004	031	Therefore, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free-woman.
048	GAL	005	001	Stand firm, therefore, in the freedom with which Christ has made us free, and be not held fast again in the yoke of bondage.
048	GAL	005	002	Behold, I Paul say to you, that if you be circumcised, Christ will profit you nothing.
048	GAL	005	003	I testify indeed again to every man that is circumcised, that he is bound to do the whole law.
048	GAL	005	004	You that are justified by law, have withdrawn from Christ: you have fallen from grace.
048	GAL	005	005	For we, through the Spirit which we obtain by faith, wait for the hope of righteousness.
048	GAL	005	006	For, in Christ Jesus, neither circumcision avails any thing, nor uncircumcision, but faith that works by love.
048	GAL	005	007	You were running well; who kept you back from obedience to the truth?
048	GAL	005	008	This readiness to be persuaded is not from him that calls you.
048	GAL	005	009	A little leaven leavens the whole mass.
048	GAL	005	010	I have confidence in you through the Lord, that you will cultivate no other disposition: but he that troubles you, who ever he may be, shall bear his condemnation.
048	GAL	005	011	But, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why am I yet persecuted? Then, the offense of the cross has ceased.
048	GAL	005	012	that those who trouble you would even cut themselves off!
048	GAL	005	013	For you have been called to freedom, brethren: only use not your freedom as an occasion for the flesh, but become servants to one another, through love.
048	GAL	005	014	For all the law is fulfilled in one commandment, in this: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.
048	GAL	005	015	But if you bite and devour one another, take heed lest you be utterly destroyed by one another.
048	GAL	005	016	I say this: Walk in the Spirit, and you will not fulfill the desires of the flesh.
048	GAL	005	017	For the desire of the flesh is against the Spirit, and the desire of the Spirit is against flesh; and these are opposed, the one to the other, so that you can not do what you would.
048	GAL	005	018	But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under law.
048	GAL	005	019	Now the works of the flesh are well known, and they are these―lewdness, uncleanness, wantonness,
048	GAL	005	020	idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strifes, jealousies, anger, party-spirit, divisions, sects,
048	GAL	005	021	envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like; with respect to which, I tell you now, as I also told you in times past, that those who practice such things shall riot inherit the kingdom of God.
048	GAL	005	022	But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faithfulness,
048	GAL	005	023	meekness, self-control. Against such there is no law.
048	GAL	005	024	Now those who are Christ’s have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.
048	GAL	005	025	If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.
048	GAL	005	026	Let us not be vain-glorious, provoking one another, envying one another.
048	GAL	006	001	Brethren, if a man be overtaken in any fault, do you, who are spiritual, restore such a one in the spirit of meekness, considering yourself, lest you also be tempted.
048	GAL	006	002	Bear with the weaknesses of one another, and so fulfill the law of Christ.
048	GAL	006	003	For if any one think himself to be something when he is nothing, he deceives himself:
048	GAL	006	004	but let each one prove his own work, and then he will have cause to boast with respect to himself only, and not with respect to another:
048	GAL	006	005	for each one shall bear his own burden.
048	GAL	006	006	Let him that is instructed in the word share with his instructor in all good things.
048	GAL	006	007	Be not deceived; God is not mocked. For whatever a man sows, that also shall he reap.
048	GAL	006	008	For he that sows for his flesh shall from the flesh, reap corruption; but he that sows for his spirit shall from the Spirit reap life eternal.
048	GAL	006	009	Let us not become weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.
048	GAL	006	010	Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all, but especially to those who are the household of the faith.
048	GAL	006	011	You see how long a letter I have written to you with my own hand.
048	GAL	006	012	As many as wish to make a fair show in the flesh, these compel you to be circumcised, only that they may not suffer persecution for the cross of the Christ.
048	GAL	006	013	For not even do those very men, who are circumcised, keep the law: but they wish you to be circumcised, that they may boast in your flesh.
048	GAL	006	014	But may I never boast save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.
048	GAL	006	015	For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision is any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.
048	GAL	006	016	And as many as walk by this rule, peace and mercy be upon them, and upon the Israel of God.
048	GAL	006	017	Henceforward let no one give me trouble: for I bear in my body the wounds which I received on account of the Lord Jesus.
048	GAL	006	018	Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.

# BOOK	049	EPH	Ephesians	Ephesians
049	EPH	001	001	Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints that are in Ephesus, and the faithful in Christ Jesus:
049	EPH	001	002	grace be to you, and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
049	EPH	001	003	Praised be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in heavenly things in Christ,
049	EPH	001	004	according as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him in love,
049	EPH	001	005	having predestinated us for adoption to himself through Jesus Christ, according to the good pleasure of his will,
049	EPH	001	006	for the praise of the glory of his grace, by which he has shown us favor in the Beloved,
049	EPH	001	007	in whom we have redemption through his blood, even the remission of sins, according to the riches of his grace,
049	EPH	001	008	which he has made to abound to us in all wisdom and understanding,
049	EPH	001	009	by making known to us the mystery of his will according to his good purpose which he had before established in himself,
049	EPH	001	010	for a dispensation at the fullness of the times, in order that he might bring together for himself all things in the Christ, both those which are in the heavens, and those which are on earth;
049	EPH	001	011	in him in whom we have obtained our portion, having been predestinated according to the purpose of him who works all things according to the counsel of his will,
049	EPH	001	012	that we should be for the praise of his glory; even we, who before had hope in the Christ:
049	EPH	001	013	in whom you also hoped after you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom, after you also believed, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise,
049	EPH	001	014	which is the earnest of our inheritance, given for the redemption of his possession to the praise of his glory.
049	EPH	001	015	For this reason I also, since I have heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and your love to all the saints,
049	EPH	001	016	do not cease to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers,
049	EPH	001	017	that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give you the spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the acknowledgment of him,
049	EPH	001	018	that, the eyes of your understanding being enlightened, you may know what is the hope of his calling, and what are the glorious riches of his inheritance in the saints,
049	EPH	001	019	and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to ward us who believe in accordance with the energy of his mighty power,
049	EPH	001	020	which he made active in the Christ when he raised him from the dead, and caused him to sit at his right hand in the heavenly places,
049	EPH	001	021	high above every principality and authority and power and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this age, but also in that which is to come;
049	EPH	001	022	and subjected all things under his feet, and made him head over all things for the church,
049	EPH	001	023	which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all his members with all things,
049	EPH	002	001	Even you, being dead to offenses and sins,
049	EPH	002	002	in which you formerly walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is actively at work in the sons of disobedience:
049	EPH	002	003	among whom also we all formerly lived in the desires of our flesh, doing the will of the flesh and of the feelings, and were by nature children of wrath, even as others:
049	EPH	002	004	but God, being rich in mercy, on account of his great love with which he loved us,
049	EPH	002	005	made alive with Christ even us, being dead to our offenses, (by grace you are saved, )
049	EPH	002	006	and raised us up, and made us sit together in heavenly places, in Christ Jesus;
049	EPH	002	007	that he might show, in the ages to come, the exceeding riches of his grace by his kindness to us in Christ Jesus.
049	EPH	002	008	For by grace you have been saved through the faith; and this matter is not of yourselves; it is the gift of God:
049	EPH	002	009	not by works, lest any one should boast.
049	EPH	002	010	For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God before prepared, that we should walk in them.
049	EPH	002	011	For which reason, remember that you were formerly Gen tiles, by natural descent, and that you are called Uncircumcision by the Circumcision; so called, from a mark made in the flesh by hands;
049	EPH	002	012	that you were at that time without Christ, being aliens from the community of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope, and having no God in the world:
049	EPH	002	013	but now, in Christ Jesus, you, who were formerly far off, have become near, by the blood of the Christ.
049	EPH	002	014	For he is our peace, who has made both parties one, and broken down the partition wall that separated us,
049	EPH	002	015	having abolished, in his flesh, the cause of enmity, the law of commandments in ordinances, that he might, by himself, form the two into one new man, thus making peace;
049	EPH	002	016	and that he might reconcile both, in one body, to God, through the cross, having by it put to death the cause of enmity;
049	EPH	002	017	and having come, he preached peace to you who were far off, and to those who were near:
049	EPH	002	018	for, through him, we both have access in one Spirit to the Father.
049	EPH	002	019	Now, therefore, you are no longer strangers and sojourners, but fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household of God,
049	EPH	002	020	having been builded upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner-stone,
049	EPH	002	021	in whom the whole building, compactly fitted together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord;
049	EPH	002	022	in whom you also are builded together, for a dwelling-place of God by his Spirit.
049	EPH	003	001	For this reason, I Paul, the prisoner of the Christ Jesus on account of you Gentiles,
049	EPH	003	002	if, indeed, you have heard of the stewardship of the grace of God, which was given to me for your benefit,
049	EPH	003	003	that by revelation was made known to me the mystery, (as I briefly wrote above,
049	EPH	003	004	so that, when you read, you can see my understanding in the mystery of the Christ, )
049	EPH	003	005	which, in other generations, was not made known to the sons of men, as it is now revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit;
049	EPH	003	006	that the Gentiles should be fellow-heirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in the Christ, through the gospel,
049	EPH	003	007	of which I was made a minister according to the gift of the grace of God which was given to me, in proportion to the energy of his power:
049	EPH	003	008	to me, who am by far the least of all the saints, has this grace been given, that I might preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of the Christ,
049	EPH	003	009	and enlighten all men with respect to the plan of the mystery, which was concealed from the ages in God, who created all things;
049	EPH	003	010	to the end that the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known, through the church, to the principalities and authorities in the heavenly regions,
049	EPH	003	011	according to the arrangement of the ages, which he established by Christ Jesus our Lord,
049	EPH	003	012	in whom we have boldness and access with confidence, through our faith in him.
049	EPH	003	013	For which cause I beseech you not to grow faint on account of my afflictions for you, which are your glory.
049	EPH	003	014	For this reason I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
049	EPH	003	015	from whom the whole family in heaven and on earth is named,
049	EPH	003	016	that he may grant to you, according to the riches of his glory, to be mightily strengthened by his Spirit in the inner man,
049	EPH	003	017	that Christ may dwell in your hearts through the faith;
049	EPH	003	018	that, being rooted and founded in love, you may be fully able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and depth and hight,
049	EPH	003	019	and to know the love of the Christ that passes our knowledge, that you may be filled with aft the fullness of God.
049	EPH	003	020	Now to him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think according to his power which works in us,
049	EPH	003	021	to him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus, throughout all the generations of the age of ages. Amen.
049	EPH	004	001	I therefore, the prisoner in the Lord, exhort you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling with which you have been called;
049	EPH	004	002	with all lowliness and meekness, with long-suffering, bearing with one another in love,
049	EPH	004	003	earnestly endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.
049	EPH	004	004	There is one body and one Spirit, even as you have been called in one hope of your calling;
049	EPH	004	005	one Lord, one faith, one immersion;
049	EPH	004	006	one God and Father of all, who is over all, and through all, and in you all.
049	EPH	004	007	But grace has been given to each one of us, according to the measure of the gift of the Christ.
049	EPH	004	008	For which reason, the scripture says: When he ascended on high, he led captive a multitude of captives, and gave gifts to men.
049	EPH	004	009	But this―He ascended―what does it mean, but that he also descended into the lower earthly regions?
049	EPH	004	010	He that descended is also he that ascended high above all the heavens, that he might fill all things.
049	EPH	004	011	And he himself gave some to be apostles, and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;
049	EPH	004	012	for the complete instruction of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the building up of the body of the Christ,
049	EPH	004	013	till we all come to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to a measure of stature that fully develops the Christ;
049	EPH	004	014	that we might no longer be children, tossed and carried about by every wind of teaching, through the artifice of men, through craftiness used by them for the deliberate planning of deceit;
049	EPH	004	015	but speaking truthfully in love, we might grow up in all things, into him who is the head, even the Christ,
049	EPH	004	016	from whom the whole body, compactly fitted together, and united by every helping joint, according to the energy in the measure of each part, makes increase of the body, for the building up of itself in love.
049	EPH	004	017	This I say, therefore, and appeal to you solemnly in the Lord, that you no longer walk as the other Gentiles walk, in the error of their minds,
049	EPH	004	018	darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardness of their heart;
049	EPH	004	019	who, being past feeling, have given themselves up to licentiousness, that they may work all manner of uncleanness with greediness.
049	EPH	004	020	But you have not so learned the Christ,
049	EPH	004	021	if, indeed, you have heard of him, and been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus:
049	EPH	004	022	that, as to your former life, you put off the old man, which is corrupt, according to its deceitful desires,
049	EPH	004	023	and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind,
049	EPH	004	024	and put on the new man, which, according to the will of God, is created in righteousness and true holiness.
049	EPH	004	025	For which reason, putting away lying, speak, every one, truth with his neighbor: for we are members one of another.
049	EPH	004	026	Be angry, and yet do not sin: let not the sun go down on your wrath,
049	EPH	004	027	nor give place to the devil.
049	EPH	004	028	Let him that steals, steal no more: but rather let labor, working with his hands that which is good, that he may have something to give to him that has need.
049	EPH	004	029	Let no impure speech come out of your mouth, but whatever is good for needful edification, that it may give grace to the hearers:
049	EPH	004	030	and grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, with which you have been sealed for the day of redemption.
049	EPH	004	031	Let all bitterness and anger and wrath and clamor and impious speaking be put away from you, with all malice:
049	EPH	004	032	and be kind to one another, compassionate, forgiving one another, as God in Christ has forgiven you.
049	EPH	005	001	Be you, therefore, imitators of God, as beloved children;
049	EPH	005	002	and walk in love, as the Christ also loved us, and gave himself for us as an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet odor.
049	EPH	005	003	But lewdness, and all manner of uncleanness, or covetousness, let them not be named among you, as it becomes saints;
049	EPH	005	004	nor obscene language, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not becoming; but rather the cheerful words of a thankful heart.
049	EPH	005	005	For you know this, that no lewd nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of the Christ and of God.
049	EPH	005	006	Let no one deceive you with vain words: for on account of these things, the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience.
049	EPH	005	007	Therefore, be not partakers with them.
049	EPH	005	008	For you were formerly darkness; but now you are light in the Lord: walk as children of light;
049	EPH	005	009	(for the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth; )
049	EPH	005	010	learning what is acceptable to the Lord;
049	EPH	005	011	and do not participate in the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather even reprove them;
049	EPH	005	012	for it is a shame even to speak of the things that are done by them in secret.
049	EPH	005	013	But all these works, when reproved, are made manifest by the light: for every thing that makes manifest is light.
049	EPH	005	014	Wherefore, the scripture says: Awake you that sleep, and arise from the dead, and Christ will give you light.
049	EPH	005	015	See, then, that you walk circumspectly, not as unwise, but as wise men,
049	EPH	005	016	redeeming the time, because the days are evil.
049	EPH	005	017	Wherefore, be not ignorant, but understand what the will of the Lord is.
049	EPH	005	018	And be not drunk with wine, in which is debauchery; but be filled with the Spirit;
049	EPH	005	019	speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord,
049	EPH	005	020	giving thanks to our God and Father always for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;
049	EPH	005	021	being subject one to another in the fear of God.
049	EPH	005	022	Wives, be subject to your own husbands as to the Lord:
049	EPH	005	023	for the husband is the head of the wife, as the Christ also is the head of the church; and he is the savior of the body.
049	EPH	005	024	But as the church is subject to the Christ, so, also, let the wives be subject to their own husbands in every thing.
049	EPH	005	025	Husbands, love your wives, as the Christ also loved the church, and delivered himself up for it,
049	EPH	005	026	that he might sanctify it, having cleansed it by the bath of water through the word,
049	EPH	005	027	in order that he might present it to himself a glorious church, having neither stain, nor wrinkle, nor any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.
049	EPH	005	028	So ought men to love their own wives as their own bodies. He that loves his wife loves himself;
049	EPH	005	029	for no one ever yet hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, even as the Christ the church:
049	EPH	005	030	because we are members of his body, being of his flesh, and of his bones.
049	EPH	005	031	For this cause a man shall leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave to his wife, and the two shall be one flesh.
049	EPH	005	032	Great is this mystery; but I speak of Christ and of the church.
049	EPH	005	033	But yet, let each one of you so love his wife as himself; and let the wife see that she reverence her husband.
049	EPH	006	001	Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.
049	EPH	006	002	Honor your father and your mother, which is the first commandment with a promise,
049	EPH	006	003	that it may be well with you, and that you may live long on the earth.
049	EPH	006	004	And you fathers, do not provoke your children to anger: but bring them up in the instruction and discipline of the Lord.
049	EPH	006	005	Servants, be subject to your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in the simplicity of your heart, as to the Christ;
049	EPH	006	006	not with eye-service, as pleasing men, but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the soul;
049	EPH	006	007	with good will doing service as to the Lord, and not as to men;
049	EPH	006	008	knowing that whatever good any one does, the same shall he receive from the Lord, whether he is a servant or a freeman.
049	EPH	006	009	And you masters, do the same things to them, leaving off threatening, knowing that you yourselves have a master in heaven, and there is no respect of persons with him.
049	EPH	006	010	Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in his mighty power.
049	EPH	006	011	Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand firm against the wiles of the devil:
049	EPH	006	012	for our conflict is not with flesh and blood, but with the principalities, with the authorities, with the rulers of the darkness of this world, with the wicked spirits in the heavenly regions.
049	EPH	006	013	Therefore, take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand them in the evil day, and having overcome them all, to stand firm.
049	EPH	006	014	Stand, therefore, having your loins girded about with truth, and wearing the breastplate of righteousness,
049	EPH	006	015	and having your feet shod with that preparation for defense supplied by the gospel of peace;
049	EPH	006	016	taking up, over all, the shield of faith, with which you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one:
049	EPH	006	017	and take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:
049	EPH	006	018	praying with all prayer and supplication, at all times, in the Spirit; and to this end being watchful in all perseverance, and supplication for all the saints:
049	EPH	006	019	and for me, that speech may be given me, in opening my mouth with boldness, that I may make known the mystery of the gospel,
049	EPH	006	020	for which I am an ambassador in chains, that in it I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.
049	EPH	006	021	But that you, also, may know my affairs, how I do, Tychicus, my beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, will make known all things to you;
049	EPH	006	022	him I have sent to you for this very purpose, that you may know our affairs, and that he may comfort your hearts.
049	EPH	006	023	Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
049	EPH	006	024	Grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity.

# BOOK	050	PHI	Philippians	Philippians
050	PHI	001	001	Paul and Timothy, servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus that are in Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:
050	PHI	001	002	grace be to you, and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
050	PHI	001	003	I thank my God on every remembrance of you―
050	PHI	001	004	always in every supplication of mine for you all, making my supplication with joy―
050	PHI	001	005	for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day till now:
050	PHI	001	006	being confident of this very thing, that he who has begun a good work in you, will carry it on till the day of Jesus Christ;
050	PHI	001	007	as it is right for me to think this of you all, because I say I have you in my heart; both in my bonds and in my defense and confirmation of the gospel, I say I have you all in my heart as being joint partakers of my grace.
050	PHI	001	008	For God is my witness how ardently I love you with the affection of Christ Jesus.
050	PHI	001	009	I also pray for this, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and all understanding,
050	PHI	001	010	in order that you may distinguish things that differ, to the end that you may be pure and blameless till the day of Christ,
050	PHI	001	011	being filled with the fruit of righteousness, which fruit is by Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.
050	PHI	001	012	But I wish you to know, brethren, that the things which have befallen me have turned out rather to the advancement of the gospel;
050	PHI	001	013	so that my bonds which are for Christ have become known to be such in all the palace, and in all other places;
050	PHI	001	014	and most of the brethren in the Lord, having confidence in my bonds, are more bold to speak the word without fear.
050	PHI	001	015	Some, indeed, preach the Christ, because of envy and a contentious disposition, and some because of good-will.
050	PHI	001	016	These do it from love, because they know that I am set for the defense of the gospel;
050	PHI	001	017	those preach Christ from a contentious disposition, not sincerely, thinking that they will add affliction to my bonds.
050	PHI	001	018	What difference does this make? Christ is, nevertheless, preached in every way, whether in pretense or in truth; and in this I rejoice, yes, and I will rejoice:
050	PHI	001	019	for I know that this will result in my benefit through your supplication, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,
050	PHI	001	020	according to my earnest expectation and hope, that in nothing shall I be ashamed, but with all boldness, as at all times, so even now, Christ will be magnified in my body, whether by life or by death.
050	PHI	001	021	For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.
050	PHI	001	022	But if this, my life in the flesh, would be profitable for my work in the ministry, verily, what I should choose I know not.
050	PHI	001	023	I am in a strait between the two, having the desire to depart and be with Christ, which is far better:
050	PHI	001	024	yet to abide in the flesh is more needful for you.
050	PHI	001	025	And of this I feel assured, that I shall remain and continue among you all for your advancement and joy in the faith,
050	PHI	001	026	that your rejoicing in Christ Jesus may become more abundant through me by my being present among you again.
050	PHI	001	027	Only conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of the Christ, that, whether I come and see you, or be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that you stand fast in one spirit, with one soul striving together for the faith of the gospel,
050	PHI	001	028	and in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of destruction, but to you of salvation, and that from God.
050	PHI	001	029	For to you it is given in behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but, also, to suffer for him,
050	PHI	001	030	since you have the same conflict that you saw in me, and now hear to be in me.
050	PHI	002	001	If, therefore, there is any consolation in Christ, if any comfort arising from love, if any participation of the Spirit, if any affections and mercies,
050	PHI	002	002	fulfill my joy, that you be of the same mind, having the same love, of one soul, of one mind;
050	PHI	002	003	doing nothing in strife and vain glory, but in lowliness of mind let each esteem others better than himself.
050	PHI	002	004	Consider not each one his own gifts, but each one also the gifts of others.
050	PHI	002	005	Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus,
050	PHI	002	006	who, being in the form of God, did not think it an act of robbery to be equal with God;
050	PHI	002	007	but he divested himself by taking the form of a servant, and being made in the likeness of men:
050	PHI	002	008	and being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself by becoming obedient even to death, the death, indeed, of the cross.
050	PHI	002	009	For which reason God has highly exalted him, and, also, bestowed on him a name that is above every name;
050	PHI	002	010	that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow of those who are in heaven, and those who are on earth, and those who are under the earth;
050	PHI	002	011	and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
050	PHI	002	012	So, then, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling;
050	PHI	002	013	for it is God, who, of his good pleasure, works in you both the will and the power to perform.
050	PHI	002	014	Do all things without murmurings and disputings,
050	PHI	002	015	that you may be without reproach and Harmless, the children of God, without blame, in the midst of a wicked and perverse generation, among whom you shine as luminaries in the world,
050	PHI	002	016	holding forth the word of life, that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I did not run in vain, nor labor in vain.
050	PHI	002	017	But if I am poured out on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice, and rejoice with you all.
050	PHI	002	018	In like manner do you also rejoice, and rejoice with me.
050	PHI	002	019	But I trust in the Lord Jesus, to send Timothy shortly to you, that I also may be refreshed by knowing your condition;
050	PHI	002	020	for I have no one of a kindred spirit who will sincerely care for your condition:
050	PHI	002	021	for all seek their own, not the things of Jesus Christ.
050	PHI	002	022	But you know his approved character, that as a son with a father he has served with me in the gospel.
050	PHI	002	023	Him, therefore, I hope to send immediately, as soon as I know how it may go with me.
050	PHI	002	024	But I trust in the Lord that I myself also will come shortly.
050	PHI	002	025	Yet I thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus my brother and companion in labor and fellow-soldier, but your apostle, who also ministered to my want,
050	PHI	002	026	because he longed after you all, and was much distressed, because you had heard that he was sick.
050	PHI	002	027	And, indeed, he was sick near to death; but God had mercy on him, and not on him only, but on me also, that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow.
050	PHI	002	028	I sent him, therefore, the sooner, that, by seeing him again, you might rejoice, and that I might be the less sorrowful.
050	PHI	002	029	Receive him, therefore, in the Lord with all joy, and regard such as worthy of honor;
050	PHI	002	030	because for the work of the Christ he was near to death, not regarding his life, that he might supply that which was lacking in your service to me.
050	PHI	003	001	Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you is to me indeed not burdensome; but for you it is safe.
050	PHI	003	002	Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of the concision.
050	PHI	003	003	For we are the circumcision, who worship God in spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh;
050	PHI	003	004	though, indeed, I have a ground of confidence in the flesh. If any other thinks he has a ground of confidence in the flesh, I more;
050	PHI	003	005	circumcised the eighth day, of the race of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of the Hebrews; as it respects law, a Pharisee;
050	PHI	003	006	as it respects zeal, persecuting the church; as it respects righteousness which is by law, blameless.
050	PHI	003	007	But the things which were gain to me, these I counted loss for Christ.
050	PHI	003	008	Yes, verily, I also count all things to be loss, for the excellence of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, on account of whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them to be refuse, that I may gain Christ,
050	PHI	003	009	and be found in him, not having my own righteousness which was by law, but the righteousness which is by faith in Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith,
050	PHI	003	010	that I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, by conforming myself to his death,
050	PHI	003	011	if, by any means, I may attain to the resurrection from the dead.
050	PHI	003	012	Not that I have already attained, or have already reached the goal; but I am pressing forward, that I may lay hold on that for which I was laid hold on by Christ Jesus.
050	PHI	003	013	Brethren, I do not conclude that I have already laid hold:
050	PHI	003	014	but one thing I do; forgetting the things which are behind, and reaching forward to those which are before, I press toward the goal, for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.
050	PHI	003	015	Let us, therefore, as many as are fully enlightened, be of this mind: and if you are of another mind with respect to any thing, God will reveal even this to you.
050	PHI	003	016	But as far as we have attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us have the same mind.
050	PHI	003	017	Be imitators of me, brethren, and observe those who thus walk as you have us for an example.
050	PHI	003	018	For many walk, of whom I often said to you, and now say even weeping, that they are enemies of the cross of the Christ,
050	PHI	003	019	whose end is destruction, whose god is their appetite, and whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things.
050	PHI	003	020	But our citizenship is in heaven, whence also we look for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ,
050	PHI	003	021	who will transform our humbled body, and make it like his glorious body, according to that power by which he is able to subdue all things to himself.
050	PHI	004	001	So, then, my brethren, beloved and ardently desired, my joy and my crown, so stand fast in the Lord, my beloved.
050	PHI	004	002	I beseech Euodia, and I beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord.
050	PHI	004	003	Now I beseech you also, true yoke-fellow, to assist those women who labored with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and my other fellow-laborers, whose names are in the book of life.
050	PHI	004	004	Rejoice in the Lord always; and again I say, Rejoice.
050	PHI	004	005	Let your gentleness be known to all men: the Lord is at hand.
050	PHI	004	006	Be anxious about nothing, but in every thing, by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God:
050	PHI	004	007	and the peace of God, which passes all understanding, will keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.
050	PHI	004	008	Finally, brethren, whatever things are true, whatever things are honorable, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report, if there is any virtue, or any praise, think of these things.
050	PHI	004	009	Do those things which you have learned and received, and heard and seen in me, and the God of peace will be with you.
050	PHI	004	010	I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at length your care for me has revived again; in this, indeed, you had me in mind, but you lacked opportunity.
050	PHI	004	011	I do not speak in respect to want: for I have learned, in whatever condition I am, to be content.
050	PHI	004	012	I know what it is to be in want, and what it is to have abundance. Everywhere and in all things, I have been fully instructed in being full and in being hungry, in having abundance and in being in want.
050	PHI	004	013	I am able to do all things through Christ who strengthens me.
050	PHI	004	014	Yet you have done well in contributing to the relief of my affliction.
050	PHI	004	015	Now you Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church contributed to me so that I kept an account of giving and receiving, but you only.
050	PHI	004	016	For even when I was in Thessalonica, you sent once and again to aid me in my need.
050	PHI	004	017	Not that I seek a gift; but I desire fruit that may abound to your account.
050	PHI	004	018	But I have all, and abound. I am full, having received from Epaphroditus your gifts, a sweet odor, a sacrifice acceptable, well-pleasing to God.
050	PHI	004	019	But my God will supply all your need, according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.
050	PHI	004	020	Now to God, even our Father, be glory from age to age. Amen.
050	PHI	004	021	Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren that are with me salute you.
050	PHI	004	022	All the saints salute you, especially those who are of Caesar’s household.
050	PHI	004	023	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.

051	COL	001	002	to the saints and faithful brethren in Christ that are in Colosse: grace be to you, and peace from God our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ.
051	COL	001	003	We give thanks to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,
051	COL	001	004	since we heard of your faithfulness in Christ Jesus, and your love for all the saints,
051	COL	001	005	in consequence of the hope which is laid up for you in the heavens, of which you heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel,
051	COL	001	006	which is present among you, as it is also in all the world, and is producing fruit, even as it has been doing also among you, since the day you heard and knew the grace of God in truth,
051	COL	001	007	as you learned from Epaphras, our dear fellow-servant, who is a faithful servant of Christ for you,
051	COL	001	008	and who also made known to us your love in spirit.
051	COL	001	009	For this reason, we also, from the day in which we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to request that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will, in all wisdom and spiritual understanding,
051	COL	001	010	so that you may walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, in order to please him in all things, by means of every good work bringing forth fruit, and increasing in the knowledge, of God,
051	COL	001	011	strengthened with all power, according to his glorious might, in order to all patience and long-suffering with joyfulness,
051	COL	001	012	giving thanks to the Father, who has made us fit for a portion of the inheritance of the saints in light:
051	COL	001	013	who has delivered us from the authority of darkness, and has translated us into the kingdom of his beloved Son,
051	COL	001	014	in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins;
051	COL	001	015	who is the image of the invisible God, the first-born of every creature;
051	COL	001	016	for by him were all things created, things in heaven and things in earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones, or lordships, or principalities, or authorities; all things were created by him, and for him:
051	COL	001	017	and he is before all things, and by him all things consist:
051	COL	001	018	and he is the head of the body, the church: and he is the beginning, the first-born from the dead, that in all things he might be preeminent;
051	COL	001	019	for it pleased the Father that all his fullness should dwell in him,
051	COL	001	020	and by him to reconcile all things to himself, having made peace by the blood of his cross; by him, I say, whether things on earth or things in heaven.
051	COL	001	021	And you, who were formerly alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now has he reconciled
051	COL	001	022	by means of death in his fleshly body, that he may present you holy, and without spot, and blameless in his sight;
051	COL	001	023	if you continue in the faith, founded and settled, and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel that you have heard, which has been preached to every creature under heaven, of which I, Paul, have been made a minister.
051	COL	001	024	Now I rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up what remains of my sufferings for Christ in my flesh for the sake of his body, which is the church,
051	COL	001	025	of which I was made a minister according to the commission from God, which was given to me for you, that I might fully preach the word of God,
051	COL	001	026	the mystery which was concealed from the ages and the generations, but is now made manifest to his saints,
051	COL	001	027	to whom God would make known what is the glorious riches of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory,
051	COL	001	028	whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus:
051	COL	001	029	to which end I also labor, striving according to his energy, which works in me mightily.
051	COL	002	001	For I wish you to know how great a conflict I have for you, and for those in Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;
051	COL	002	002	that their hearts may be comforted, they being firmly united in love in order to gain all the riches of the full assurance of understanding, that they may acknowledge the mystery of God, even the Father, and of Christ,
051	COL	002	003	in whom are stored up all the treasures of wisdom and of knowledge.
051	COL	002	004	Now I say this, that no one may deceive you by persuasive words.
051	COL	002	005	For, though I am absent in flesh, yet I am present with you in spirit, rejoicing to behold your order, and the firmness of your faith in Christ.
051	COL	002	006	As, therefore, you received Christ Jesus our Lord, so walk in him,
051	COL	002	007	rooted, and built up in him, and strengthened in the faith, as you have been taught, abounding in it with thanksgiving.
051	COL	002	008	See that no one make you the victims of imposture by means of philosophy and vain deceit, according to the tradition of men, according to the rudiments of the world, and not according to Christ:
051	COL	002	009	for in him dwells all the fullness of the Godhood bodily.
051	COL	002	010	And you are complete in him who is the head of all principality and authority:
051	COL	002	011	in whom you have been also circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in the putting off the body of the sins of the flesh, by the circumcision of Christ,
051	COL	002	012	when you were buried with him in immersion, in which you were also raised with him by your faith in the energy of God, who raised him from the dead.
051	COL	002	013	And you, being dead to your offenses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, he has made alive together with him, having forgiven you all your offenses;
051	COL	002	014	having blotted out the handwriting in ordinances which was against us, which was opposed to us, he also took it out of the way, driving a nail through it by means of his cross;
051	COL	002	015	and having spoiled the principalities and authorities, he made a show of them openly by triumphing over them through it.
051	COL	002	016	Let no one judge you, therefore, in meat or in drink, or in respect to a feast, or the new moon, or sabbaths,
051	COL	002	017	which things are a shadow of things to come, but the substance is in Christ,
051	COL	002	018	Let no one gain his purpose in depriving you of the palm by an affected humility and worship of angels, prying into things which he has not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,
051	COL	002	019	and not holding the head, from which the whole body gathering vigor, and firmly united by joints and bands, increases with the increase of God.
051	COL	002	020	If, then, you have died with Christ from the elements of the world, why, as though living in the world, do you submit to ordinances?
051	COL	002	021	Touch not, taste not, handle not,
051	COL	002	022	(all of which are for the destruction of those who use them, ) according to the commandments and teachings of men;
051	COL	002	023	and these have a show of wisdom in will-worship and affected humility and neglect of the body, and in no regard for the gratification of the flesh.
051	COL	003	001	If, then, you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above, where the Christ sits at the right hand of God;
051	COL	003	002	mind the things that are above, not the things that are on the earth:
051	COL	003	003	for you are dead, and your life is hid with the Christ in God.
051	COL	003	004	When the Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall you also appear with him in glory.
051	COL	003	005	Put to death, therefore, your members that are on the earth, lewdness, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry;
051	COL	003	006	on account of these things the wrath of God comes on the children of disobedience,
051	COL	003	007	in which things you also formerly walked when you lived in them.
051	COL	003	008	But now do you also put away all these―anger, wrath, malice, reviling, obscene language from your mouth.
051	COL	003	009	Lie not one to another, seeing that you have put off the old man with his deeds,
051	COL	003	010	and have put on the new man, which is renewed for knowledge, according to the image of him that created him;
051	COL	003	011	in which new creation there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all and in all.
051	COL	003	012	Put on, therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, a merciful disposition, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, long-suffering:
051	COL	003	013	bearing with one another, and forgiving one another, if any one have a complaint against any; even as Christ forgave you, so also do you:
051	COL	003	014	and over all these put on love, which is the bond of perfectness.
051	COL	003	015	And let the peace of God, to which you are called in one body, rule in your hearts, and be thankful.
051	COL	003	016	Let the word of the Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, by teaching and admonishing one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with gratitude in your hearts to the Lord.
051	COL	003	017	And whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.
051	COL	003	018	Wives, be subject to your husbands, as it is becoming in the Lord.
051	COL	003	019	Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them.
051	COL	003	020	Children, obey your parents in all things: for this is well-pleasing to the Lord.
051	COL	003	021	Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be disheartened.
051	COL	003	022	Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh, not with eye-service, as pleasing men, but with simplicity of heart, fearing God.
051	COL	003	023	And whatever you do, do from the soul, as to the Lord, and not to men;
051	COL	003	024	knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance: for you serve the Lord Christ.
051	COL	003	025	But he that does wrong shall receive for the wrong which he has done; and there is no respect of persons.
051	COL	004	001	Masters, give to your servants what is just and equal, for you know that you have a Master in heaven.
051	COL	004	002	Persevere in prayer, and be watchful in the same with thanksgiving;
051	COL	004	003	praying at the same time also for us, that God may open for us a door of utterance to speak the mystery of the Christ, for which I am in bonds,
051	COL	004	004	that I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak.
051	COL	004	005	Walk in wisdom toward those who are without, redeeming the time.
051	COL	004	006	Let your speech be always with grace, seasoned with salt, that you may know how you ought to answer every one.
051	COL	004	007	All that relates to me, Tychicus, my beloved brother and faithful minister and fellow-servant in the Lord, will make known to you.
051	COL	004	008	I have sent him to you for this very purpose, that he may know your condition, and comfort your hearts;
051	COL	004	009	I have sent him with Onesimus, my faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They will make known all things that are done here.
051	COL	004	010	Aristarchus, my fellow-prisoner, salutes you, and so does Marcus the nephew of Barnabas, concerning whom you received commandments; if he come to you, receive him;
051	COL	004	011	Jesus also, who is called Justus, salutes you: these are of the circumcision: and these only are my fellow-workers for the kingdom of God, who have been a comfort to me.
051	COL	004	012	Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, salutes you; he always strives earnestly for you in his prayers, that you may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God.
051	COL	004	013	For I testify for him, that he has a great zeal for you and those in Laodicea and those in Hierapolis.
051	COL	004	014	Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas, salute you.
051	COL	004	015	Salute the brethren in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church that is in his house.
051	COL	004	016	And when this letter has been read among you, cause that it be read in the church of the Laodiceans also; and see that you also read the letter from Laodicea;
051	COL	004	017	and say to Archippus: Take heed to the ministry which you have received in the Lord, that you fulfill it.
051	COL	004	018	The salutation of me, Paul, with my own hand. Remember my bonds. Grace be with you. Amen.

# BOOK	052	1TH	1 Thessalonians	1 Thessalonians
052	1TH	001	001	Paul and Sylvanus and Timothy to the church of the Thessalonians, which is in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ: grace be to you, and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
052	1TH	001	002	We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers,
052	1TH	001	003	remembering unceasingly your work, which is the result of faith, your labor, the cause of which is love, and your patience, which springs from your hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of our God and Father:
052	1TH	001	004	because we know, brethren beloved of God, your election.
052	1TH	001	005	For our gospel came not to you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and in full assurance, as you know what sort of persons we were among you for your sakes.
052	1TH	001	006	And you became imitators of us and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction with joy of the Holy Spirit,
052	1TH	001	007	so that you were examples to all that believe, in Macedonia and Achaia.
052	1TH	001	008	For from you, the word of the Lord sounded out, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also your faith in God has gone abroad in every place, so that we have no need to speak any thing.
052	1TH	001	009	For they themselves declare concerning us what kind of entrance we had to you, and how you turned to God from idols, to serve the living and true God,
052	1TH	001	010	and to wait for his Son from heaven, even Jesus, whom he raised from the dead, and who delivers us from the coming wrath.
052	1TH	002	001	For you yourselves know, brethren, our entrance among you, that it was not in vain.
052	1TH	002	002	But having suffered before, and having been outraged, as you know, in Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak to you the gospel of God in the midst of great peril.
052	1TH	002	003	For our exhortation arose not from deception, nor from uncleanness, nor was it with guile;
052	1TH	002	004	but as God had judged us worthy to be intrusted with the gospel, so we speak, not as pleasing men, but God, who tries our hearts.
052	1TH	002	005	For neither nattering words did we at any time use, as you know, nor a pretext for covetousness; God is witness:
052	1TH	002	006	nor did we seek glory from men, neither from you nor from others; though we could have been burdensome as the apostles of Christ.
052	1TH	002	007	But we were gentle among you. As a nurse nourishes her children,
052	1TH	002	008	so, having a strong affection for you, we were well pleased to impart to you not only the gospel of God, but our own lives also, because you had become dear to us.
052	1TH	002	009	For you remember, brethren, our labor and toil; for, laboring night and day, that we might not be burdensome to any one of you, we preached to you the gospel of God.
052	1TH	002	010	You are witnesses, and God also, in how holy and just and blameless a manner we conducted ourselves among you that believe,
052	1TH	002	011	as indeed you know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a father his children,
052	1TH	002	012	that you should walk in a manner worthy of God, who has called you to his own kingdom and glory.
052	1TH	002	013	For this reason, also, we thank God without ceasing; because, when you received the word of God, as preached by us, you embraced it, not as the word of men, but, as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually works in you that believe.
052	1TH	002	014	For you, brethren, became imitators of the churches of God in Judea which are in Christ Jesus; for you, also, have suffered the same things from your own countrymen, that they have suffered from the Jews,
052	1TH	002	015	who both killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and have persecuted us, and do not please God, and are opposed to all men,
052	1TH	002	016	forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they may be saved, in order that they may fill up their sins at all times: but the wrath is coming upon them to the full.
052	1TH	002	017	But we, brethren, having been taken from you for a short time, in person, not in heart, did, with great desire, endeavor the more earnestly to see your face.
052	1TH	002	018	For this reason, we intended to go to you, (I Paul) both once and again, but Satan hindered us.
052	1TH	002	019	For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even you, in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?
052	1TH	002	020	You indeed are our glory and joy.
052	1TH	003	001	Wherefore, being no longer able to contain ourselves, we thought it good to be left at Athens alone;
052	1TH	003	002	and we sent Timothy our brother and minister of God in the gospel of the Christ, in order that he might strengthen and comfort you with respect to your faith,
052	1TH	003	003	that no one be moved by these afflictions; for you yourselves know that we are appointed to this:
052	1TH	003	004	for even when we were with you, we told you beforehand that we were about to be afflicted, as it also came to pass, and as you know.
052	1TH	003	005	For this reason, when I could no longer contain myself, I sent to know your faith, lest by any means the tempter had tempted you, and our labor should be in vain.
052	1TH	003	006	But now, since Timothy has come to us from you, and has told us the good news of your faith and love, and that you have a good remembrance of us at all times, greatly desiring to see us, as indeed we desire to see you,
052	1TH	003	007	for this reason we are comforted concerning you, brethren, in all our distress and affliction, by your faith:
052	1TH	003	008	for now we live, if you stand firm in the Lord.
052	1TH	003	009	For what thanks can we render to God for you, for the great joy with which we rejoice on your account before our God,
052	1TH	003	010	night and day praying exceedingly that we may see your face, and perfect that which is lacking in your faith?
052	1TH	003	011	Now, may God himself, even our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way to you.
052	1TH	003	012	And may the Lord cause you to increase and abound in love to one another and to all, even as we toward you,
052	1TH	003	013	in order that he may establish your hearts blameless in holiness, in the presence of our God and Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints.
052	1TH	004	001	Finally, then, brethren, we beseech and exhort you, by our Lord Jesus, that as you learned from us how you ought to walk and please God, you would abound more and more.
052	1TH	004	002	For you know what commandments we gave you by our Lord Jesus.
052	1TH	004	003	For this is the will of God, your sanctification, that you keep yourselves from lewdness;
052	1TH	004	004	That each one of you know how to keep his vessel in sanctification and in honor,
052	1TH	004	005	not in passionate desire, as the Gentiles do, who know not God;
052	1TH	004	006	That no one take advantage of or injure his brother in this matter; because the Lord takes vengeance for all such things, as we also told you before, and fully testified:
052	1TH	004	007	for God has not called us for uncleanness, but for holiness.
052	1TH	004	008	Therefore, he that despises, despises not man, but God, who has given us his Holy Spirit.
052	1TH	004	009	But with respect to brotherly love, you have no need that I write to you: for you yourselves are taught of God to love one another;
052	1TH	004	010	and indeed you do this to all the brethren that are in all Macedonia. But we exhort you, brethren, that you abound in love more and more,
052	1TH	004	011	and that you earnestly endeavor to live quietly, and that you attend to your own business, and work with your own hands, as we commanded you;
052	1TH	004	012	in order that you may walk with propriety toward those who are without, and may have need of nothing.
052	1TH	004	013	But concerning those who have fallen asleep, I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that you may not grieve, as others who have no hope.
052	1TH	004	014	For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, so also should we believe that God will, through Jesus, bring with him those who sleep.
052	1TH	004	015	For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we, the living, who remain till the coming of the Lord, shall not precede those who are asleep
052	1TH	004	016	for the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God; and the dead in Christ shall arise first;
052	1TH	004	017	then we, the living who remain, shall, together with them, be caught up in clouds into the air to meet the Lord, and so shall we be ever with the Lord.
052	1TH	004	018	So, then, comfort one another with these words.
052	1TH	005	001	But, brethren, you have no need that I write to you of the times and seasons;
052	1TH	005	002	for you yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so comes as a thief in the night:
052	1TH	005	003	for when they shall say, Peace and safety, then sudden destruction comes upon them, as the pains of birth upon a woman with child, and they shall not escape.
052	1TH	005	004	But you, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.
052	1TH	005	005	You are all sons of light, and sons of day: we are not of night, nor of darkness.
052	1TH	005	006	Therefore, let us not sleep, as do others, but let us watch and be sober.
052	1TH	005	007	For those who sleep, sleep in the night; and those who are drunken, are drunken in the night.
052	1TH	005	008	But let us, who are of the day, be sober, having on the breastplate of faith and love, and for a helmet, the hope of salvation:
052	1TH	005	009	for God has not appointed us to wrath, but to the obtaining of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,
052	1TH	005	010	who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we might live together with him.
052	1TH	005	011	Wherefore, exhort one another, and edify one another, as you also do.
052	1TH	005	012	Now we beseech you, brethren, to have regard for those who labor among you, and preside over you in the Lord, and admonish you,
052	1TH	005	013	and that you esteem them very highly in love on account of their work. Be at peace among yourselves.
052	1TH	005	014	We exhort you, brethren, admonish the unruly, comfort the faint-hearted, earnestly care for the weak-minded, be of a long-suffering disposition toward all.
052	1TH	005	015	See that no one render evil for evil to any, but always pursue that which is good toward one another and toward all.
052	1TH	005	016	Rejoice always;
052	1TH	005	017	pray without ceasing;
052	1TH	005	018	in every thing give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.
052	1TH	005	019	Quench not the Spirit.
052	1TH	005	020	Despise not prophesyings.
052	1TH	005	021	Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.
052	1TH	005	022	Abstain from every appearance of evil.
052	1TH	005	023	Now the God of peace himself sanctify you wholly; and may your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
052	1TH	005	024	Faithful is he that calls you; and he will do what he has promised.
052	1TH	005	025	Brethren, pray for us.
052	1TH	005	026	Salute all the brethren with a holy kiss.
052	1TH	005	027	I adjure you by the Lord, that this letter be read to all the holy brethren.
052	1TH	005	028	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.

# BOOK	053	2TH	2 Thessalonians	2 Thessalonians
053	2TH	001	001	Paul and Sylvanus and Timothy to the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ:
053	2TH	001	002	grace be to you, and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
053	2TH	001	003	We are bound to give thanks to God always for you, brethren, as it is right, because your faith grows exceedingly, and the love of every one of you all toward each other abounds:
053	2TH	001	004	so that we ourselves glory in you, among the churches of God, for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and afflictions which you endure;
053	2TH	001	005	which endurance of yours is a proof of the righteous judgment of God, in order that you may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you suffer:
053	2TH	001	006	since, indeed, it is a righteous thing with God, to repay affliction to those who afflict you,
053	2TH	001	007	and to you that are afflicted, rest with us, at the revelation of our Lord Jesus from heaven with his mighty angels,
053	2TH	001	008	in flaming fire, to take vengeance on those who know not God, and who obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ;
053	2TH	001	009	these shall suffer punishment in that day, even eternal destruction, far from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power,
053	2TH	001	010	when he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all those who believe, and in you also, because our testimony among you was believed.
053	2TH	001	011	In order to which, we also pray always for you, that our God may count you worthy of this calling, and may fulfill all the good pleasure of his goodness, and the work of faith with power,
053	2TH	001	012	that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
053	2TH	002	001	But, we beseech you, brethren, concerning the coming of; our Lord Jesus Christ, and our coming together to him,
053	2TH	002	002	that you be not hastily shaken from the persuasion of your mind, nor be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by report, nor by letter as written by us, as though the day of the Lord is at hand.
053	2TH	002	003	Let no one deceive you by any means; for that day will not come, unless the apostasy come first, and the man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition,
053	2TH	002	004	who opposes and exalts himself above every one that is called God, or that is worshiped, so that he sits as God in the temple of God, openly showing him self that he is God.
053	2TH	002	005	Do you not remember that, while I was with you, I told you these things?
053	2TH	002	006	And now you know what restrains, in order that he may be revealed in his own proper time.
053	2TH	002	007	For the mystery of iniquity is already at work; only he that now restrains will restrain, till he be taken out of the way:
053	2TH	002	008	and then shall that lawless one be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will destroy by the spirit of his mouth, and will utterly overthrow by the brightness of his coming:
053	2TH	002	009	he will destroy him, whose coming is, according to the energy of Satan, with all power and signs and wonders of falsehood,
053	2TH	002	010	and with all the delusion of unrighteousness in those who perish, because they did not receive the love of the truth, in order that they might be saved.
053	2TH	002	011	And for this reason God will send them strong delusion, in order that they may believe a lie,
053	2TH	002	012	that all may be condemned who believe not the truth, but have pleasure in unrighteousness.
053	2TH	002	013	But we are bound to give thanks to God always for you, brethren, beloved of the Lord, because God did, from the beginning, choose you to salvation, by sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth,
053	2TH	002	014	to which he called you by our gospel, in order that you might obtain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
053	2TH	002	015	Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which you have been taught, whether by word or by our letter.
053	2TH	002	016	Now may our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father, who has loved us, and given us eternal consolation and good hope through grace,
053	2TH	002	017	comfort your hearts, and strengthen you in every good word and work.
053	2TH	003	001	Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may run and be glorified even as among you;
053	2TH	003	002	and that we may be delivered from wicked and evil men; for all have not the disposition for faith.
053	2TH	003	003	But the Lord is faithful, and he will strengthen you, and keep you from the evil one.
053	2TH	003	004	And we have confidence in the Lord with respect to you, that you both do, and will continue to do, the things which we command you.
053	2TH	003	005	And the Lord direct your hearts to the love of God, and to the patience of the Christ.
053	2TH	003	006	Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw from every brother that walks disorderly, and not according to the tradition which he received from us.
053	2TH	003	007	For you yourselves know how you ought to imitate us: for we did not behave in a disorderly manner among you,
053	2TH	003	008	nor did we eat any one’s bread for nothing: but worked with labor and toil, night and day, that we might not burden any one of you;
053	2TH	003	009	this we did, not because we have not authority, but that we might give ourselves to you as an example, in order that you might imitate us.
053	2TH	003	010	For when we were with you, we gave you this commandment, that if any one will not work, neither let him eat.
053	2TH	003	011	For we hear that some walk about among you in a disorderly manner, doing no work, but being busybodies.
053	2TH	003	012	Now we command such, and exhort them by our Lord Jesus Christ, that they work with quietness, and eat their own bread.
053	2TH	003	013	And you, brethren, should not be weary in well-doing.
053	2TH	003	014	And if any one obey not our word by this letter, note that man, and do not keep company with him, that he may be ashamed;
053	2TH	003	015	and yet do not regard him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.
053	2TH	003	016	Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means. The Lord be with you all.
053	2TH	003	017	The salutation of Paul with my own hand, which is the token in every letter: so I write.
053	2TH	003	018	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.

# BOOK	054	1TI	1 Timothy	1 Timothy
054	1TI	001	001	Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the appointment of God our Savior, and the Lord Jesus Christ our hope,
054	1TI	001	002	to Timothy, my true son in the faith; grace, mercy, peace from God our Father, and Christ Jesus our Lord.
054	1TI	001	003	As, on going into Macedonia, I besought you to remain in Ephesus, that you might charge some that they teach no other thing,
054	1TI	001	004	nor give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which produce disputes rather than godly edification, which is in faith;
054	1TI	001	005	(Now the end of the commandment is love out of a pure heart, and out of a good conscience, and out of faith unfeigned:
054	1TI	001	006	which things some not having aimed at, have turned aside to idle disputation,
054	1TI	001	007	desiring to be teachers of law, though understanding neither what they say nor of what they boldly affirm.
054	1TI	001	008	But we know that the law is good, if any one use it lawfully;
054	1TI	001	009	knowing this, that law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for the unholy and for scorners, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for man-slayers,
054	1TI	001	010	for lewd persons, for sodomites, for men-stealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and for whatever other thing is opposed to sound teaching,
054	1TI	001	011	according to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which has been intrusted to me.
054	1TI	001	012	And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has given me power, because he counted me faithful, and put me into the ministry;
054	1TI	001	013	me, I say, who before was a reviler and a persecutor and an overbearing man. But I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief:
054	1TI	001	014	and the grace of our Lord was very abundant with faith, and love which is in Christ Jesus.
054	1TI	001	015	Assuredly true and worthy of all acceptation is this saying: that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief.
054	1TI	001	016	But for this reason I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might show all long-suffering, for an example to those who might afterward believe on him in order to life eternal.
054	1TI	001	017	Now to the King of the ages, the incorruptible, invisible, only wise God, be honor and glory from age to age. Amen.)
054	1TI	001	018	This charge I commit to you, son Timothy, in accordance with the preceding prophecies concerning you, that by them you may war the good warfare,
054	1TI	001	019	holding faith and a good conscience, which some having thrust from them, as it respects faith have made shipwreck; of whom are Hymenæus and Alexander,
054	1TI	001	020	whom I have delivered to Satan, that they may learn not to revile.
054	1TI	002	001	I exhort, therefore, first of all, that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks be made for all men,
054	1TI	002	002	for kings, and for all that are in authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and gravity.
054	1TI	002	003	For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior,
054	1TI	002	004	who is willing that all men should be saved, and come to the knowledge of the truth.
054	1TI	002	005	For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,
054	1TI	002	006	who gave himself a ransom for all, of which the testimony has been given in its proper times,
054	1TI	002	007	to give which testimony I have been appointed a preacher and an apostle; (I speak the truth, and lie not; ) a teacher of the Gentiles in faithfulness and in truth.
054	1TI	002	008	I will, therefore, that the men pray everywhere, lifting up holy hands without wrath and disputation.
054	1TI	002	009	In like manner, also, I will that the women adorn themselves with decorous dress, with modesty and sobriety, not with plaited hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly raiment,
054	1TI	002	010	but with good works; since this becomes women who profess godliness.
054	1TI	002	011	Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.
054	1TI	002	012	I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.
054	1TI	002	013	For Adam was first formed, then Eve.
054	1TI	002	014	And Adam was not deceived: but the woman being deceived, was in transgression;
054	1TI	002	015	but they shall be saved by the bearing of children, if they continue in faith and love and holiness with sobriety.
054	1TI	003	001	This is a true saying: If any desires the office of a bishop, he desires a good work.
054	1TI	003	002	A bishop, then, must be blameless, the husband of one wife, watchful, soberminded, modest, hospitable, able to teach,
054	1TI	003	003	not fond of wine, not quarrelsome, not one who makes money by base means; but gentle, not contentious, not covetous;
054	1TI	003	004	one that rules his own house well; having his children in subjection with all gravity:
054	1TI	003	005	for if a man knows not how to rule his own house, how will he take care of the church of God?
054	1TI	003	006	Not a new convert, lest, having become conceited, he fall into the condemnation of the devil.
054	1TI	003	007	Further, he must have a good reputation from those who are without, lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.
054	1TI	003	008	The deacons, likewise, must be grave, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not makers of money by base means,
054	1TI	003	009	holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.
054	1TI	003	010	And let these also be first proved, then let them become deacons, being blameless.
054	1TI	003	011	Their wives likewise must be grave, not slanderers, watchful, faithful in all things.
054	1TI	003	012	Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well.
054	1TI	003	013	For those who have filled the office of a deacon well, gain for themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith that is in Christ Jesus.
054	1TI	003	014	I write these things to you, hoping to come to you shortly;
054	1TI	003	015	but if I delay, that you may know how you ought to conduct yourself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and support of the truth.
054	1TI	003	016	And confessedly great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in flesh, justified in spirit, seen by angels, preached among the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up in glory.
054	1TI	004	001	Now the Spirit says expressly, that, in the last times, some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and teachings suggested by demons,
054	1TI	004	002	through the hypocrisy of liars, who are seared in their conscience,
054	1TI	004	003	who forbid to marry, and command to abstain from meats, which God has created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe, and know the truth.
054	1TI	004	004	For every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be rejected, if it be received with thanksgiving;
054	1TI	004	005	for it is sanctified by the word of God, and by prayer.
054	1TI	004	006	By recommending these things to the attention of the brethren, you will be a good minister of Jesus Christ, being nourished with the words of the faith, and of good teaching, which you have fully known.
054	1TI	004	007	But reject those profane and old-womanish fables, and exercise yourself for godliness.
054	1TI	004	008	For the exercise of the body is profitable for little; but godliness is profitable for all things, and has the promise of the life that now is, and also of that which is to come.
054	1TI	004	009	This is a true saying, and worthy of all acceptation:
054	1TI	004	010	for to this end we both labor, and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Savior of all men, especially of those who believe.
054	1TI	004	011	These things command and teach.
054	1TI	004	012	Let no one despise your youth; but be an example to the believers, in word, in behavior, in love, in spirit, in faithfulness, in purity.
054	1TI	004	013	Till I come, give attention to reading, to exhortation, to teaching.
054	1TI	004	014	Neglect not the gift that is in you, which was given you according to prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the eldership.
054	1TI	004	015	Meditate upon these things; give yourself wholly to them, that your advancement may be manifest in all things.
054	1TI	004	016	Take heed to yourself, and to your teaching; continue in them; for by doing this, you will save both yourself, and those who hear you.
054	1TI	005	001	Do not rebuke an elderly man, but entreat him as a father; the younger men, as brothers:
054	1TI	005	002	the elder women, as mothers; the younger women, as sisters, with all purity.
054	1TI	005	003	Honor widows that are widows indeed.
054	1TI	005	004	But if any widow has children or grand-children, let them learn first to be dutiful to their own family, and to requite their parents; for that is good and acceptable in the sight of God.
054	1TI	005	005	But she that is a widow indeed, and left alone, trusts in God, and continues in supplications and prayers night and day.
054	1TI	005	006	But she that lives voluptuously, is dead while she lives.
054	1TI	005	007	These things also give in charge, that they may be blameless.
054	1TI	005	008	And if any one provides not for his own, and especially for those of his own house hold, he has denied the faith, and is worse than an unbeliever.
054	1TI	005	009	Let a widow be put on the list, if she is not under sixty years, having been the wife of one man,
054	1TI	005	010	having a good reputation for good works; if she has borne children, if she has entertained strangers, if she has washed the saints feet, if she has relieved the afflicted, if she has diligently followed every good work.
054	1TI	005	011	But the younger widows reject: for when they become wanton against the Christ, they desire to marry,
054	1TI	005	012	incurring condemnation, because they have set aside their former obligation.
054	1TI	005	013	At the same time, also, they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also, and busybodies, speaking things which are not proper.
054	1TI	005	014	I will, therefore, that the younger widows marry, bear children, manage the house, and thus give no occasion to the adversaries to speak reproachfully.
054	1TI	005	015	For some have already turned aside after Satan.
054	1TI	005	016	If any believing man or woman has widows, let him or her relieve them, and let not the church be burdened, that it may relieve those who are widows indeed.
054	1TI	005	017	Let the elders who rule well, be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in word and teaching.
054	1TI	005	018	For the scripture says: You shall not muzzle the ox that treads out the grain; and, The laborer is worthy of his hire.
054	1TI	005	019	Receive not an accusation against an old man, unless before two or three witnesses.
054	1TI	005	020	Those who sin rebuke before all, that the rest also may fear.
054	1TI	005	021	I charge you before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels, that you observe these things without prejudice, and that you do nothing by partiality.
054	1TI	005	022	Lay hands hastily on no man, nor be partaker of other men’s sins: keep yourself pure.
054	1TI	005	023	Drink water no longer, but use a little wine for your stomach’s sake, and your frequent infirmities.
054	1TI	005	024	Some men’s sins are manifest beforehand, going before to judgment. Some persons, however, they follow after.
054	1TI	005	025	Likewise, also, the good works of some are manifest beforehand; and those which are otherwise can not be concealed.
054	1TI	006	001	Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor, that the name of God, and his teaching, be not reviled.
054	1TI	006	002	And those who have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are brethren: but rather let them serve them, because they who partake of the benefit of their service, are believers and beloved brethren. These things enforce in your teaching and exhortation.
054	1TI	006	003	If any one teaches other things, and does not assent to the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the teaching which is according to godliness,
054	1TI	006	004	he is mad with conceit, knowing nothing, but has a morbid fondness for questions and contentions about words, out of which come envy, strife, railing, evil suspicions,
054	1TI	006	005	and wranglings, on the part of men who are corrupt in mind, and destitute of the truth, who suppose that godliness is a source of gain. From such withdraw yourself.
054	1TI	006	006	But godliness, with a contented disposition, is great gain.
054	1TI	006	007	For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain that we can carry nothing out.
054	1TI	006	008	And having food and raiment, with these let us be content.
054	1TI	006	009	But those who will be rich fail into temptation and a snare, and many foolish and hurtful desires, which drown men in destruction and perdition.
054	1TI	006	010	For the love of money is the root of all evil; through the desire of which, some have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.
054	1TI	006	011	But do you, O man of God, shun these things, and pursue righteousness, godliness, faithfulness, love, patience, meekness.
054	1TI	006	012	Fight the good fight of the faith; lay hold on eternal life, to which you have been called, and for which you confessed the good confession before many witnesses.
054	1TI	006	013	I charge you, in the sight of God, who makes all things alive, and before Christ Jesus, who, before Pontius Pilate, confessed a good confession,
054	1TI	006	014	that you keep this commandment, so that you may be spotless and blameless till the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ,
054	1TI	006	015	which, in his own times, he will show, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;
054	1TI	006	016	who alone has immortality, dwelling in light unapproachable, whom no man has seen, nor can see, to whom be honor and power eternal. Amen.
054	1TI	006	017	Charge those who are rich in this age, that they be not proud, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who gives us all things richly for our enjoyment,
054	1TI	006	018	that they do good, that they be rich in good works, that they be ready to distribute, liberal,
054	1TI	006	019	treasuring up for themselves a good foundation for the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.
054	1TI	006	020	O Timothy, keep that which is committed to your charge, avoiding those profane and empty babblings, and disputations about knowledge falsely so called;
054	1TI	006	021	by making a profession of this knowledge, some have erred as it respects the faith. Grace be with you. Amen.

# BOOK	055	2TI	2 Timothy	2 Timothy
055	2TI	001	001	Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, by the will of God, according to the promise of life, which is in Christ Jesus,
055	2TI	001	002	to Timothy my beloved son; grace, mercy, and peace from God our Father, and Christ Jesus our Lord.
055	2TI	001	003	I thank God, whom I serve with a pure conscience, after the custom of my forefathers, that, without ceasing, I have remembrance of you in my prayers night and day,
055	2TI	001	004	greatly desiring to see you, being mindful of your tears, that I may be filled with joy;
055	2TI	001	005	for I remember the unfeigned faith that is in you, which dwelt first in your grandmother Lois, and in your mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that it dwells in you also.
055	2TI	001	006	Wherefore I exhort you to kindle up the gift of God that is in you by the laying on of my hands.
055	2TI	001	007	For God has not given us the spirit of fear, but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.
055	2TI	001	008	Be not, therefore, ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me, his prisoner: but jointly suffer evil in the gospel according to the power of God,
055	2TI	001	009	who has saved us, and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the times of the ages,
055	2TI	001	010	but is now made manifest by the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ, who has deprived death of its power, and brought life and incorruptibility to light through the gospel;
055	2TI	001	011	to which I have been appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles;
055	2TI	001	012	for which cause I also suffer these things; yet I am not ashamed: for I know in whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have intrusted to him till that day.
055	2TI	001	013	Hold fast the form of sound words which you have heard from me, in faithfulness and in love which is in Christ Jesus.
055	2TI	001	014	That good thing which was intrusted to you, keep by the Holy Spirit that dwells in us.
055	2TI	001	015	You know this, that all those who are in Asia have turned away from me; all those, I say, of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.
055	2TI	001	016	May the Lord give mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain:
055	2TI	001	017	but when he was in Rome, he sought for me very diligently, and found me.
055	2TI	001	018	The Lord grant to him, that he may find mercy from the Lord in that day. And in how many things he ministered to me in Ephesus, you know very well.
055	2TI	002	001	Do you, therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus;
055	2TI	002	002	and the things which you have heard from me through many witnesses, these do you commit to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.
055	2TI	002	003	Do you, therefore, suffer evil, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.
055	2TI	002	004	Every one that serves as a soldier keeps himself free from the business of this life, that he may please him that has chosen him to be a soldier.
055	2TI	002	005	And if any one also contend in the public games, he is not crowned, unless he contend according to the laws.
055	2TI	002	006	It is necessary that, the farmer should labor, before he partakes of the fruits.
055	2TI	002	007	Consider what I say, for I pray that the Lord may give you understanding in all things.
055	2TI	002	008	Remember that Jesus Christ, of the posterity of David, was raised from the dead, according to my gospel;
055	2TI	002	009	in which I suffer evil, as an evil-doer, even to bonds: but the word of God is not bound.
055	2TI	002	010	For this reason I endure all things for the sake of the elect, that they also may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory.
055	2TI	002	011	Assuredly true is the saying: If indeed we have died with him, we shall also live with him;
055	2TI	002	012	if we are patient, we shall also reign with him; if we deny him, he will also deny us;
055	2TI	002	013	if we are unfaithful, he remains faithful: he can not deny himself.
055	2TI	002	014	Put them in mind of these things, charging them before the Lord that they dispute not about words to no profit, which disputes end in the overthrow of the hearers.
055	2TI	002	015	Strive to present yourself to God as approved, a workman that has no cause to be ashamed, rightly setting forth the word of truth.
055	2TI	002	016	But shun profane and vain babblings; for they will make further advance to ungodliness,
055	2TI	002	017	and their word will eat as a gangrene: of whom are Hymenæus and Philetus,
055	2TI	002	018	who, as it respects the truth, have erred, saying that the resurrection has already taken place; and they overthrow the faith of some.
055	2TI	002	019	But the foundation of God stands firm, having this inscription: The Lord knows those who are his; and, Let every one that names the name of Christ depart from iniquity.
055	2TI	002	020	In a great house, however, there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth, and some for honor, and some for dishonor.
055	2TI	002	021	If, therefore, any one will cleanse himself from these strifes about words, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified, highly useful to the master, prepared for every good work.
055	2TI	002	022	Shun youthful desires, and follow righteousness, faithfulness, love, peace, with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.
055	2TI	002	023	But avoid foolish and unprofitable questions, because you know that they produce contentions:
055	2TI	002	024	and the servant of the Lord must not be contentious, but gentle toward all men, able to teach, patient under evils,
055	2TI	002	025	in meekness instructing those who oppose themselves, if, possibly, God may give them repentance in order to the acknowledgment of the truth,
055	2TI	002	026	and that they may awake to sobriety out of the snare of the devil, after having been taken captive by him according to his will.
055	2TI	003	001	But know this, that in the last days trying times will come.
055	2TI	003	002	For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boasters, proud, revilers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,
055	2TI	003	003	without natural affection, implacable, false accusers, intemperate, fierce, haters of those who are good,
055	2TI	003	004	traitors, rash, conceited, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God,
055	2TI	003	005	having a form of godliness, but denying its power: from these also turn away.
055	2TI	003	006	For of this sort are those who worm themselves into houses, and lead captive silly women that are laden with sins, and influenced by various desires,
055	2TI	003	007	that are always learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.
055	2TI	003	008	Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so these also will withstand the truth; men corrupt in mind, rejected as it respects the faith.
055	2TI	003	009	But they shall proceed no further; for their madness shall be manifest to all, as was the madness of those men.
055	2TI	003	010	But you have fully known my teaching, my course of life, my purpose, my faithfulness, my long-suffering, my love, my patience,
055	2TI	003	011	my persecutions, my sufferings which came upon me in Antioch, in Iconium, in Lystra; you well know what persecutions I endured: and yet out of them all, the Lord delivered me.
055	2TI	003	012	And all that will live godly in Christ Jesus, shall suffer persecution.
055	2TI	003	013	But evil men and impostors will become worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.
055	2TI	003	014	But do you continue in the things which you have learned and well understood, knowing from whom you learned them,
055	2TI	003	015	and that from a child you have known the holy scriptures, which are able to make you wise in order to salvation, through faith that is in Christ Jesus.
055	2TI	003	016	All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness,
055	2TI	003	017	that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished for every good work.
055	2TI	004	001	I charge you, therefore, before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom,
055	2TI	004	002	preach the word, be urgent in season and out of season, reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering and teaching.
055	2TI	004	003	For the time will come when they will not endure sound teaching, but according to their own desires they will procure for themselves an abundance of teachers to gratify their itching ears:
055	2TI	004	004	and they will turn away their ears from the truth, and be turned to fables.
055	2TI	004	005	But do you be watchful in all things, endure evil, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry?
055	2TI	004	006	For I am now ready to be poured out, and the time of my departure is at hand.
055	2TI	004	007	I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith:
055	2TI	004	008	henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give me at that day; and not to me only, but to all those who love his appearing.
055	2TI	004	009	Endeavor to come to me shortly;
055	2TI	004	010	for Demas has forsaken me, having loved the present age; and he has gone to Thessalonica, Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.
055	2TI	004	011	Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for the ministry.
055	2TI	004	012	I have sent Tychicus to Ephesus.
055	2TI	004	013	When you come, bring the cloak that I left in Troas with Carpus, and the books, especially the parchments.
055	2TI	004	014	Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord repay him according to his works.
055	2TI	004	015	Do you, also, beware of him, for he has greatly withstood our words.
055	2TI	004	016	At my first defense no one stood by me, but all forsook me; may it not be laid to their charge:
055	2TI	004	017	but the Lord stood by me, and gave me strength, that through me that which is preached might be fully known, and that all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.
055	2TI	004	018	And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and bring me safe to his heavenly kingdom. To him be glory from age to age. Amen.
055	2TI	004	019	Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.
055	2TI	004	020	Erastus remained at Corinth. I left Trophimus sick at Miletus.
055	2TI	004	021	Endeavor to come to me before winter. Eubulus and Pudens and Linus and Claudia and all the brethren salute you.
055	2TI	004	022	The Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Grace be with you all. Amen.

# BOOK	056	TIT	Titus	Titus
056	TIT	001	001	Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God’s elect, and the acknowledgement of the truth, which is according to godliness;
056	TIT	001	002	in hope of eternal life, which God, who can not lie, promised be fore the times of the ages,
056	TIT	001	003	but he has in his own times manifested his word by preaching, which was committed to me according to the commandment of God our Savior;
056	TIT	001	004	to Titus, my true son, according to the common faith: grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior.
056	TIT	001	005	I left you in Crete for this purpose, that you might set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I commanded you:
056	TIT	001	006	if any one is blameless, the husband of one wife, if he has faithful children that are not accused of riotous living, or disobedient.
056	TIT	001	007	For the bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not self-willed, not passionate, not fond of wine, not quarrelsome, not one who makes money by base means;
056	TIT	001	008	but hospitable, a lover of goodness, sober-minded, just, holy, temperate,
056	TIT	001	009	holding fast the sure word as it is taught, that he may be able, by sound teaching, both to exhort and to convince the opposers.
056	TIT	001	010	For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision,
056	TIT	001	011	whose mouths must be stopped: these subvert whole houses by teaching, for the sake of base gain, things which they ought not to teach.
056	TIT	001	012	One of themselves, a prophet of their own, has said: The Cretans are always liars, evil wild beasts, lazy gluttons.
056	TIT	001	013	This testimony is true; wherefore rebuke them severely, that they may be sound in the faith,
056	TIT	001	014	and not give heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men that turn away from the truth.
056	TIT	001	015	To the pure, all things are pure: but to the denied and unbelieving, nothing is pure; but their mind and their conscience are denied.
056	TIT	001	016	They profess that they know God, but in their works they deny him, being detestable and disobedient, and, as it respects every good work, rejected.
056	TIT	002	001	But do you speak the things that become sound teaching;
056	TIT	002	002	that the aged men be vigilant, grave, sober-minded, sound in faith, in love, in patience;
056	TIT	002	003	that the aged women likewise be, in deportment, as it becomes holy women, not slanderers, not enslaved to much wine, teachers of good things,
056	TIT	002	004	That they may teach the young women to be sober-minded, to love their husbands, to love their children,
056	TIT	002	005	to be discreet, chaste, fond of home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not reviled.
056	TIT	002	006	Exhort the young men likewise to be sober-minded,
056	TIT	002	007	in all things showing yourself an example of good works; in teaching, showing incorruptness, gravity,
056	TIT	002	008	sound speech that can not be condemned; that he that is opposed may be ashamed, seeing he has no evil thing to say of us.
056	TIT	002	009	Exhort servants to be subject to their own masters, and to please them well in all things, not contradicting,
056	TIT	002	010	not stealing, but showing all good faithfulness, that they may adorn the teaching of God our Savior in all things.
056	TIT	002	011	For the grace of God, which brings salvation to all men, has appeared,
056	TIT	002	012	teaching us, that denying ungodliness and worldly desires, we should live soberly and righteously and godly in the present age;
056	TIT	002	013	looking for the blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ,
056	TIT	002	014	who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify for himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.
056	TIT	002	015	Speak these things, and exhort and rebuke with all strictness. Let no one despise you.
056	TIT	003	001	Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and authorities, to obey rulers, to be ready for every good work,
056	TIT	003	002	to revile no one, not to be contentious, but gentle, showing all meekness to all men.
056	TIT	003	003	For we ourselves also were formerly foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving various desires and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.
056	TIT	003	004	But when the kindness and philanthropy of God our Savior appeared, he saved us,
056	TIT	003	005	not by works of righteousness which we had done, but according to his own mercy, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Spirit,
056	TIT	003	006	which he poured out on us richly, through Jesus Christ our Savior;
056	TIT	003	007	that, being justified by his grace, we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life.
056	TIT	003	008	This saying is true, and in respect to these things, I will that you affirm strongly, in order that those who have believed in God may be careful to practice good works: these are the things that are honorable and profitable for men.
056	TIT	003	009	But foolish questions and genealogies and strifes and contentions about the law, avoid; for they are unprofitable and vain.
056	TIT	003	010	A man that is a sectary, reject, after the first and second admonition,
056	TIT	003	011	knowing that such a one is perverted, and sins, being self-condemned.
056	TIT	003	012	When I send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, hasten to come to me at Nicopolis; for I have determined to spend the winter there.
056	TIT	003	013	Conduct Zenas the lawyer, and Apollos on their journey with care, that nothing may be wanting to them.
056	TIT	003	014	Let our people also learn to practice good works for necessary uses, that they may not be unfruitful.
056	TIT	003	015	All that are with me salute you. Salute those who love us in faithfulness. Grace be with you all. Amen.

057	PHM	001	001	Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy my brother, to Philemon my beloved, and our fellow-laborer,
057	PHM	001	002	and to our beloved Apphia, and to Archippus our fellow-soldier, and to the church that is in your house:
057	PHM	001	003	grace be to you all, and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
057	PHM	001	004	I thank my God, making mention of you always in my prayers,
057	PHM	001	005	hearing of your love and your faith, which you have in the Lord Jesus, and toward all the saints,
057	PHM	001	006	that your participation in the faith may be active in the acknowledgment of every good thing that is in us, to the honor of Christ Jesus.
057	PHM	001	007	For we have great joy and comfort in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed by you, brother.
057	PHM	001	008	Wherefore, though I have great boldness in Christ to command you to do that which is becoming,
057	PHM	001	009	yet, on account of my love, I rather exhort you, being such a one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner on account of Jesus Christ.
057	PHM	001	010	I beseech you for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds,
057	PHM	001	011	who, for some time, has been unprofitable to you, but now is very profitable to you and to me:
057	PHM	001	012	I send him back, and do you receive him, that is, my son.
057	PHM	001	013	I did wish to keep him with me, that, in your stead, he might serve me in my bonds for the gospel;
057	PHM	001	014	but, without your consent, I was not willing to do any thing, that your good deed might not be as a matter of necessity, but one of free-will.
057	PHM	001	015	Perhaps, indeed, lie departed for a short time for this reason, that you might receive him forever;
057	PHM	001	016	no longer as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, especially by me, and how much more by you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.
057	PHM	001	017	If, then, you regard me as a partner, receive him as myself.
057	PHM	001	018	But if he has done you any wrong, or owes you any thing, put that to my account.
057	PHM	001	019	I, Paul, do write it with my own hand, I will repay it; that I may not say to you, that you owe to me even yourself besides.
057	PHM	001	020	Yes, brother, let me have joy of you in the Lord: refresh my heart in the Lord.
057	PHM	001	021	Having confidence in your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I say.
057	PHM	001	022	At the same time, also, prepare me a lodging: for I hope that through the prayers of you all, I may be given to you.
057	PHM	001	023	Epaphras, my fellow-prisoner in Christ Jesus, salutes you:

# BOOK	058	HEB	Hebrews	Hebrews
058	HEB	001	001	God, who in many parts and in many ways spoke in ancient times to the fathers by the prophets, has in these last days spoken to us by his Son,
058	HEB	001	002	whom he has appointed heir of all things, by whom, also, he made the ages;
058	HEB	001	003	who, being the effulgence of his glory and the exact representation of his essence, and upholding all things by his own powerful word, when he had by himself made expiation for our sins, sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high,
058	HEB	001	004	having become so far superior to the angels, as the name which he has inherited is more excellent than theirs.
058	HEB	001	005	For to which of the angels did he at any time say: Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee? And again: I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?
058	HEB	001	006	And again, when he brings the first-begotten into the world, he says: And let all the angels of God worship him.
058	HEB	001	007	And of the angels he says: Who makes his angels winds, and his ministers a flame of fire.
058	HEB	001	008	But to the Son: Thy throne, O God, is from age to age: a scepter of rectitude is the scepter of thy kingdom.
058	HEB	001	009	Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore, God, thy God, has anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
058	HEB	001	010	And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning, didst lay the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the works of thy hands.
058	HEB	001	011	They shall perish; but thou remainest: and they all shall grow old as a garment;
058	HEB	001	012	and as a mantle thou shalt fold them up, and they shall be changed; but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.
058	HEB	001	013	But to which of the angels has he said at any time: Sit on my right hand, till I make thy enemies thy footstool?
058	HEB	001	014	Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister to those who shall inherit salvation?
058	HEB	002	001	Therefore, we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest we let them glide away.
058	HEB	002	002	For if the word spoken by angels was steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just punishment,
058	HEB	002	003	how shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation? which at first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed to us by those who heard him;
058	HEB	002	004	God also bearing testimony with them by signs and wonders, and by various mighty deeds, and by distributions of the Holy Spirit, according to his own will.
058	HEB	002	005	For not to angels has he subjected the world to come of which we speak.
058	HEB	002	006	But one in a certain place testified, saying: What is man, that thou art mindful of him; or the son of man, that thou dost visit him?
058	HEB	002	007	Thou hast made him a little lower than the angels; thou hast crowned him with glory and honor;
058	HEB	002	008	thou hast put all things under his feet. For, in putting all things under him, he left nothing that is not put under him: but now we do not yet see all things put under him.
058	HEB	002	009	But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, that he might, by the grace of God, taste death for every man―we see him, on account of his having suffered death, crowned with glory and honor.
058	HEB	002	010	For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the author of their salvation perfect through sufferings.
058	HEB	002	011	For both he that sanctifies, and those who are sanctified, are all of one Father: for which reason, he is not ashamed to call them brethren, saying:
058	HEB	002	012	I will declare thy name among my brethren; in the midst of the assembly, will I sing hymns to thee.
058	HEB	002	013	And again: I will put my trust in him. And again: Behold, I, and the children that God has given me.
058	HEB	002	014	Since, then, the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also, in like manner, partook of the same, that, through his death, he might deprive of power him that has the power of death, that is, the devil;
058	HEB	002	015	and might set free those who, through fear of death, were all their lifetime subject to bondage.
058	HEB	002	016	For, verily, he does not take hold of angels, but he takes hold of the posterity of Abraham.
058	HEB	002	017	Wherefore, it behooved him to be made like his brethren in all things, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, in order to make expiation for the sins of the people.
058	HEB	002	018	For, inasmuch as he himself has suffered in being tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted.
058	HEB	003	001	Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the apostle and high priest of our confession, Christ Jesus,
058	HEB	003	002	who is faithful to him that appointed him, as Moses also was faithful in all his house.
058	HEB	003	003	For this man is counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who has builded the house, has more honor than the house.
058	HEB	003	004	For every house is builded by some one; but he that built all things is God.
058	HEB	003	005	And Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, to bear testimony to those things which were to be spoken afterward;
058	HEB	003	006	but Christ, as a Son over his own house; whose house we are, if we hold the confidence and the joy of our hope firm to the end.
058	HEB	003	007	Wherefore, as the Holy Spirit says: To-day, if you will hear his voice,
058	HEB	003	008	harden not your hearts, as in the bitter provocation, in the day of trial in the wilderness,
058	HEB	003	009	where your fathers tried me, proved me, and saw my works forty years.
058	HEB	003	010	Where fore, I was angry with that generation, and said, They do always err in their heart, and they have not known my ways:
058	HEB	003	011	so that I swore in my anger, They shall not enter into my rest.
058	HEB	003	012	Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in apostatizing from the living God.
058	HEB	003	013	But exhort one another daily, while it is called To-day, lest any of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.
058	HEB	003	014	For we are partakers of the Christ, if we hold our begun confidence firm to the end;
058	HEB	003	015	while it is said, To-day, if you will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the bitter provocation.
058	HEB	003	016	For some, when they had heard, did bitterly provoke; yet, not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.
058	HEB	003	017	But with whom was he angry forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness?
058	HEB	003	018	But to whom did he swear that they should not enter into his rest, but to those who believed not?
058	HEB	003	019	And so we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.
058	HEB	004	001	Let us fear, therefore, lest, as a promise of entering into his rest still remains, any of you should seem to come short of it.
058	HEB	004	002	For we have had the good news preached to us, even as they had: but the word preached did not profit them, for it was not mixed with faith in those who heard it.
058	HEB	004	003	For we who have believed are to enter into rest, as he said: So I swore in my anger, they shall not enter into my rest; namely, that rest from his works which had been finished from the foundation of the world.
058	HEB	004	004	For he spoke in a certain place of the seventh day, thus: And God did rest on the seventh day from all his works;
058	HEB	004	005	and in this place again: They shall not enter into my rest.
058	HEB	004	006	Since, then, it remains that some must enter into it, and they, to whom the good news was first preached, did not enter in on account of unbelief,
058	HEB	004	007	again, he determines a certain day, saying in David, after so long a time, To-day, as it is said, To-day, if you will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.
058	HEB	004	008	For if Joshua had given them rest, he would not, after this, have spoken of another day.
058	HEB	004	009	There remains, therefore, a sabbath-state for the people of God.
058	HEB	004	010	For he that has entered into his rest, he also has ceased from his own works, as God did from his.
058	HEB	004	011	Let us earnestly strive, therefore, to enter into that rest, lest any one fall after the same example of unbelief.
058	HEB	004	012	For the word of God is living and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and pierces even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.
058	HEB	004	013	And there is no creature which is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked, and exposed to the eyes of him to whom we must give an account.
058	HEB	004	014	Seeing, then, that we have a great high priest, who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession.
058	HEB	004	015	For we have not a high priest that can not sympathize with our infirmities; but he was tempted in all things like ourselves, yet without sin.
058	HEB	004	016	Let us come, therefore, with boldness, to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy, and find grace to help in every time of need.
058	HEB	005	001	For every high priest chosen from among men, is appointed for men, in things pertaining to God, that he may offer gifts and sacrifices for sins:
058	HEB	005	002	being able to have compassion on the ignorant and erring, because he himself is beset with infirmity:
058	HEB	005	003	and on account of this, he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to make offering for sins.
058	HEB	005	004	And no one takes this honor to himself, but he that is called by God, as Aaron also was called.
058	HEB	005	005	So, also, the Christ did not take upon himself the honor of becoming a high priest: but he gave him this honor, who said to him, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee:
058	HEB	005	006	as he says also in another place, Thou art a priest forever, after the order of Melchisedec.
058	HEB	005	007	In the days of his flesh, having offered up prayers and supplications, with strong crying and tears, to him that was able to save him from death, and having been heard with respect to that which he feared,
058	HEB	005	008	although he was a Son, he yet learned obedience from the things which he suffered;
058	HEB	005	009	and, having been made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation to all that obey him,
058	HEB	005	010	being called by God a high priest after the order of Melchisedec.
058	HEB	005	011	Of him we have many things to say, and difficult to be explained, if we do say them, since you are slow in understanding.
058	HEB	005	012	For though you ought to be teachers, considering the time, yet you have need that some one teach you again what are the first elements of the oracles of God; and you have become such as have need of milk, and not of strong food.
058	HEB	005	013	For every one that partakes of milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe.
058	HEB	005	014	But strong food belongs to those who are of mature age, who, by use, have their internal senses exercised to the discerning of both good and evil.
058	HEB	006	001	Therefore, omitting the elementary Christian teaching, let us go on to the perfection of Christian instruction, not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,
058	HEB	006	002	of the teaching with respect to immersions, and of the laying on of hands, of the resurrection of the dead, and of eternal condemnation.
058	HEB	006	003	And this we will do, if God permit.
058	HEB	006	004	For it is impossible to renew again to repentance those who have once been enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and have been made partakers of the Holy Spirit,
058	HEB	006	005	and have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the coming age,
058	HEB	006	006	if they fall away; since they again crucify in themselves the Son of God, and put him to an open shame.
058	HEB	006	007	For the land which drinks up the rain that comes often upon it, and produces herbs suitable for those for whom it is cultivated, receives blessing from God.
058	HEB	006	008	But that which produces thorns and thistles is rejected, and is near the curse, the end of which is to be burned.
058	HEB	006	009	But, beloved, we are confident of better things concerning you, and of things that tend to salvation, though we thus speak.
058	HEB	006	010	For God is not unjust, that he should forget your work, and the love which you have shown for his name by having ministered to the saints, and by continuing to minister.
058	HEB	006	011	But we desire every one of you to show the same diligence, in order to have your hope fully assured to the end:
058	HEB	006	012	that you may not become slothful, but imitators of those who, through faith and patience, inherit the promises.
058	HEB	006	013	For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he swore by himself,
058	HEB	006	014	saying: Most surely will I abundantly bless you, and abundantly multiply you.
058	HEB	006	015	And so, when he had waited patiently, he received the promises.
058	HEB	006	016	For, verily, men swear by the greater, and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all contradiction.
058	HEB	006	017	Wherefore, God, being more abundantly willing to show to the heirs of his promise the immutability of his purpose, interposed an oath,
058	HEB	006	018	that by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have strong consolation, who have fled to lay hold on the hope set before us;
058	HEB	006	019	which, hope we have as an anchor for the soul, both sure and steadfast, and which enters in beyond the vail,
058	HEB	006	020	whither a forerunner for us has gone, even Jesus, who is made a high priest forever after the order of Melchisedec.
058	HEB	007	001	For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him,
058	HEB	007	002	to whom also Abraham gave a tenth of all, being, first, by interpretation, King of righteousness, and then, also, King of Salem, which means King of peace,
058	HEB	007	003	without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life, but being made to resemble the Son of God, remains a priest forever.
058	HEB	007	004	Now consider how great this man was, to whom even the patriarch Abraham gave a tenth of the spoils.
058	HEB	007	005	And those of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham:
058	HEB	007	006	but he who does not count his genealogy from them, received tithes from Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.
058	HEB	007	007	And, without any contradiction, the less is blessed by the better.
058	HEB	007	008	And in the one instance, men that die receive tithes; but in the other, he receives them who has the testimony that he lives.
058	HEB	007	009	And so to speak, even Levi, who receives tithes, paid tithes through Abraham;
058	HEB	007	010	for he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him.
058	HEB	007	011	If, then, there had been a perfect expiation by means of the Levitical priesthood, (for with reference to it, the people received the law, ) what further need was there that another priest should be raised up after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?
058	HEB	007	012	It is evident that, when the priest hood is changed, there is of necessity a change also of the law.
058	HEB	007	013	For he of whom these things are said, belongs to another tribe, from which no one attended upon the altar.
058	HEB	007	014	For it is very clear that our Lord sprung from Judah, of which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood.
058	HEB	007	015	And it is yet far more evident, if, after the likeness of Melchisedec, there arises another priest,
058	HEB	007	016	who is made, not according to the law of a fleshly commandment, but according to the power of an endless life; for he testifies,
058	HEB	007	017	Thou art a priest forever after the order of Melchisedec.
058	HEB	007	018	For, indeed, there is a setting aside of the preceding commandment, because it was weak and unprofitable,
058	HEB	007	019	(for the law made no perfect expiation), and the introduction of a better hope, by which we draw near to God.
058	HEB	007	020	And inasmuch as he was made a priest, not without an oath,
058	HEB	007	021	(for those priests were made such without an oath, but this one with an oath, by him that said to him, The Lord swore, and will not repent, Thou art a priest forever after the order of Melchisedec; )
058	HEB	007	022	in so much has Jesus become the surety of a better covenant.
058	HEB	007	023	And those priests, indeed, have been many, because they were prevented by death from continuing in office.
058	HEB	007	024	But this man, because he continues forever, has an unchangeable priesthood.
058	HEB	007	025	Wherefore, he is able also to save through all time those who come to God by him, since he always lives to make intercession for them.
058	HEB	007	026	For such a high priest is suited to us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and exalted above the heavens;
058	HEB	007	027	who needs not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifices, first for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.
058	HEB	007	028	For the law makes men high priests, who have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was after the law, makes the Son, who is perfected forever.
058	HEB	008	001	Now concerning the things that have been spoken, the principal point is this: We have such a high priest, who has taken his seat at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;
058	HEB	008	002	a minister of the holy places, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.
058	HEB	008	003	For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore, it is necessary that this one also have something which he may offer.
058	HEB	008	004	For if he were on earth, he could not be a priest; because there are priests that offer gifts according to the law:
058	HEB	008	005	and these serve the copy and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: See now, says he, that you make all things according to the pattern shown you in the mount.
058	HEB	008	006	But now he has obtained a more excellent ministry, inasmuch as he is the mediator of a better covenant, which is established with reference to better promises.
058	HEB	008	007	For if that first covenant had been faultless, no place would have been sought for a second.
058	HEB	008	008	For, finding fault with them, he says: Behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, when I will ratify a new covenant for the house of Israel, and for the house of Judah:
058	HEB	008	009	not like the covenant which I made with their fathers, in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt: because they continued not in my covenant, and I disregarded them, says the Lord.
058	HEB	008	010	For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel, after those days, says the Lord; putting my laws into their understanding, I will also write them upon their hearts; and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people;
058	HEB	008	011	and they shall not teach, every one his citizen, and every one his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least of them to the greatest;
058	HEB	008	012	because I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities I will remember no more.
058	HEB	008	013	In saying, A new covenant, he has regarded the first as out of use. Now, that which is out of use, and has become old, is ready to disappear.
058	HEB	009	001	Now, the first covenant also had ordinances of worship, and the worldly sanctuary:
058	HEB	009	002	for a tabernacle was constructed, the first, in which were the candlestick, and the table, and the presence bread; and this tabernacle is called holy.
058	HEB	009	003	But after the second vail, the tabernacle which is called the holy of holies;
058	HEB	009	004	which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid on all sides with gold, in which were the golden pot that held the manna, and the rod of Aaron that budded, and the tables of the covenant;
058	HEB	009	005	and over the ark, the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy-seat; of which things we can not now speak particularly.
058	HEB	009	006	Now, when these things were thus arranged, the priests went, at all times, into the first tabernacle, discharging the service of God.
058	HEB	009	007	But into the second, the high priest alone went, once during the year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and for the errors of the people:
058	HEB	009	008	the Holy Spirit signifying this, that the way into the most holy was not yet made manifest, while the first tabernacle was still standing,
058	HEB	009	009	which, as a symbol, remains to the present time, in which are offered both gifts and sacrifices that can not make perfect, as it respects the conscience, him that does the service;
058	HEB	009	010	since he relies only on meats and drinks and various immersions, ordinances indeed of the flesh, which were imposed till the time of reformation.
058	HEB	009	011	But Christ, having come a high priest of the good things to come, through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, (that is, not of this building, )
058	HEB	009	012	entered, not by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood, once for all, into the most holy, having obtained eternal redemption.
058	HEB	009	013	For if the blood of bulls and goats, and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the unclean, cleanses them as it respects the purity of the flesh,
058	HEB	009	014	how much more will the blood of the Christ, who, through the eternal Spirit, offered himself without spot to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works, in order that you may serve the living God?
058	HEB	009	015	And for this reason, he is the mediator of the new covenant: that, since his death has taken place for the redemption of transgressions that were under the former covenant, those who are called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.
058	HEB	009	016	For where a testament is, it is necessary that there be brought in the death of the testator:
058	HEB	009	017	for a testament goes into effect after men are dead: seeing that it has no validity at all while the testator lives.
058	HEB	009	018	Wherefore, the first covenant was not instituted without blood.
058	HEB	009	019	For when Moses had spoken to all the people every commandment of the law, lie took the blood of calves and of goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people, saying:
058	HEB	009	020	This is the blood of the covenant which God enjoins on you:
058	HEB	009	021	and, in like manner, he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the service.
058	HEB	009	022	And, indeed, according to the law, almost all things are cleansed by blood; and without the shedding of blood there is no remission.
058	HEB	009	023	It was necessary, therefore, that the copies of the things in the heavens should be consecrated by these sacrifices; but that the heavenly things themselves should be consecrated by better sacrifices than these.
058	HEB	009	024	For the Christ has not entered the holy places made with hands, the copies of the true; but he has entered heaven itself, now to present himself in the presence of God for us.
058	HEB	009	025	Nor has he entered, that he should offer himself often, as the high priest enters the holy places every year with the blood of another:
058	HEB	009	026	for then, he must have suffered often since the foundation of the world. But now once in the end of the ages, he has appeared in order to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.
058	HEB	009	027	And, as it is appointed to men once to die, and after this the judgment,
058	HEB	009	028	so the Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and to those who look for him he will appear the second time, without a sin-offering, in order to salvation.
058	HEB	010	001	For the law, having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never, with the same sacrifices, which they offer year by year continually, make a perfect expiation for those who come to them:
058	HEB	010	002	for then, would they not have ceased to be offered? because the worshipers, after being once cleansed, would no longer have a consciousness of sins.
058	HEB	010	003	There is, however, in these sacrifices, a remembrance of sins every year.
058	HEB	010	004	For it is impossible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.
058	HEB	010	005	Wherefore, when he comes into the world, he says: Sacrifice and offering thou hast not desired, but a body thou hast prepared me;
058	HEB	010	006	in whole burnt-offerings and offerings for sin, thou hast had no pleasure.
058	HEB	010	007	Then, said I, Behold, I come, (in the roll of the book it is written of me, ) to do thy will, O God.
058	HEB	010	008	After saying above, Thou didst neither desire, nor take pleasure in sacrifice and offering and whole burnt-offerings and offerings for sin, which are offered according to the law,
058	HEB	010	009	then he said, Behold, I come to do thy will: he takes away the first, that he may establish the second.
058	HEB	010	010	By which will, we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ, once for all time.
058	HEB	010	011	And every priest stands daily ministering, and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:
058	HEB	010	012	but after offering one sacrifice for sins, he himself sits continually at the right hand of God,
058	HEB	010	013	henceforth waiting till his enemies be made his footstool.
058	HEB	010	014	For by one offering, he has made a perfect and perpetual expiation for the sanctified.
058	HEB	010	015	And, indeed, the Holy Spirit is a witness for us. For after he had said before,
058	HEB	010	016	This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, says the Lord; putting my laws in their hearts, I will also write them in their understandings:
058	HEB	010	017	he adds, And their sins and iniquities I will remember no more.
058	HEB	010	018	Now, where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.
058	HEB	010	019	Having therefore, brethren, confidence to enter the holiest by the blood of Jesus,
058	HEB	010	020	by a new and living way which he has dedicated for us, through the vail, that is, his flesh;
058	HEB	010	021	and having a great high, priest over the house of God,
058	HEB	010	022	let us draw near with a true heart, in full assurance of faith, having; our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water;
058	HEB	010	023	let us hold fast the unwavering confession of our hope, for he is faithful who has promised;
058	HEB	010	024	and let us consider one another that we may excite to love and good works,
058	HEB	010	025	not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as is the custom of some; but exhorting one another, and so much the more, as you see the day approaching.
058	HEB	010	026	For if we sin willfully, after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remains no longer a sacrifice for sins;
058	HEB	010	027	but a certain fearful looking for of judgment, and a fiery indignation which will devour the adversaries.
058	HEB	010	028	He that despised Moses law, died without mercy, on the testimony of two or three witnesses:
058	HEB	010	029	of how much severer punishment do you think he shall be thought worthy, who has trodden under foot the Son of God, and has counted the blood of the covenant, with which he was sanctified, a common thing, and has done despite to the Spirit of grace?
058	HEB	010	030	For we know him who has said, Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord. And again, The Lord will judge his people.
058	HEB	010	031	It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
058	HEB	010	032	But remember the former days, in which, after you were enlightened, you endured a great conflict of sufferings;
058	HEB	010	033	partly, while you became a public spectacle, by reproaches and afflictions: partly, while you became partakers with those who were so treated.
058	HEB	010	034	For you sympathized with me in my bonds, and endured joyfully the seizure of your possessions, knowing that you have for yourselves a better and abiding substance in the heavens.
058	HEB	010	035	Cast not away, therefore, your confidence, which has a great reward.
058	HEB	010	036	For you have need of patience, that, after you have done the will of God, you may receive the promise.
058	HEB	010	037	For yet a very, very little while, and He that comes will come, and will not delay.
058	HEB	010	038	But the just by faith shall live; and if he draw back, my soul will have no pleasure in him.
058	HEB	010	039	But we are not of those who draw back to perdition; but of those who believe to the saving of the soul.
058	HEB	011	001	Now, faith is a sure confidence with respect to things hoped for, a firm persuasion with respect to things not seen:
058	HEB	011	002	for by this the ancients obtained a good reputation.
058	HEB	011	003	By faith we understand that the ages were set in order by the word of God, so that the things which are seen, have not come into being from things that appear.
058	HEB	011	004	By faith Abel offered to God more sacrifice than Cain; on account of which he received testimony that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts; and by it he, though dead, yet speaks.
058	HEB	011	005	By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death, and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had the testimony that he pleased God.
058	HEB	011	006	But without faith it is impossible to please him; for he that comes to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of those who diligently seek him.
058	HEB	011	007	By faith Noah, after being warned concerning things not yet seen, moved with fear, prepared an ark for the salvation of his house; by which faith he condemned the world, and became an heir of the righteousness which is by faith.
058	HEB	011	008	By faith Abraham, when called to go out into a place that he should afterward receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went.
058	HEB	011	009	By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange land, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise:
058	HEB	011	010	for he looked for a city that has foundations, whose architect and builder is God.
058	HEB	011	011	By faith also Sarah herself received strength for the conception of seed, and brought forth a child when past the time of life, because she counted him faithful who had promised.
058	HEB	011	012	Therefore, there were born of one, who was dead as it respects these things, a posterity like the stars of heaven in multitude, and like the sand on the sea-shore, innumerable.
058	HEB	011	013	All these died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and having embraced them and confessed that they were strangers and sojourners in the land.
058	HEB	011	014	For those who say such things, declare plainly that they seek a country.
058	HEB	011	015	And if indeed they had been mindful of that from which they came, they could have had an opportunity to return.
058	HEB	011	016	But now they desire a better, that is, a heavenly country; wherefore God is not ashamed of them, that he should be called their God: for he has prepared for them a city.
058	HEB	011	017	By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: even his first-born, did he that had received the promises, offer up,
058	HEB	011	018	of which first-born it was said: In Isaac shall your posterity be called:
058	HEB	011	019	for he concluded that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead; wherefore he received him even in like manner.
058	HEB	011	020	By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.
058	HEB	011	021	By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and worshiped on the top of his staff.
058	HEB	011	022	By faith Joseph, when he was dying, made mention of the departure of the sons of Israel, and gave commandment concerning his bones.
058	HEB	011	023	By faith Moses was concealed by his parents for three months after his birth, because they saw that he was a beautiful child: and they feared not the command of the king.
058	HEB	011	024	By faith Moses, when he became a man, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter,
058	HEB	011	025	choosing rather to suffer evil with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasure of sin for a season;
058	HEB	011	026	esteeming the reproach on account of the Christ as greater riches than the treasures of Egypt: for he earnestly looked to the reward.
058	HEB	011	027	By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the anger of the king: for he patiently endured, as seeing him that is invisible.
058	HEB	011	028	By faith he kept the passover, and the affusion of blood, that he who destroyed the first-born might not touch them.
058	HEB	011	029	By faith they passed through the Bed Sea as by dry land, which the Egyptians attempting to do, were drowned.
058	HEB	011	030	By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after the people had gone around them for seven days.
058	HEB	011	031	By faith Rabab the harlot perished not with the disobedient, because she had received the spies with peace.
058	HEB	011	032	And what further shall I say? For the time would fail me, were I to tell of Gideon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthah, of David also and Samuel, and of the prophets,
058	HEB	011	033	who, through faith, subdued kingdoms, worked righteousness, obtained promises, closed the mouths of lions,
058	HEB	011	034	quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, became valiant in battle, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.
058	HEB	011	035	Women received their dead raised to life again: but others were beat to death, not accepting deliverance, that they might obtain a better resurrection;
058	HEB	011	036	others had trial of mockings and scourgings, bonds also, and imprisonments.
058	HEB	011	037	They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, they were tempted, they were slain with the sword: they went about in sheep-skins, in goat-skins, being destitute, afflicted, oppressed with evils,
058	HEB	011	038	(of whom the world was not worthy, ) wandering in deserts, and in mountains, and in caverns, and in dens of the earth.
058	HEB	011	039	And all these, having obtained a good reputation by faith, received not the promise,
058	HEB	011	040	because God had provided some better thing for us, that they, without us, should not be made perfect.
058	HEB	012	001	Wherefore, since we also have so great a cloud of witnesses lying round about us, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin that so easily besets us, and let us run with patience the race that lies before us,
058	HEB	012	002	looking to Jesus the author and finisher of the faith, who, for the joy that was set before him, endured the cross, despising the shame, and has taken his seat at the right hand of the throne of God.
058	HEB	012	003	For consider him that endured such opposition of sinners against himself, lest you become weary and despondent in your minds.
058	HEB	012	004	You have not yet resisted to blood, in your contest with sin;
058	HEB	012	005	and you have forgotten the exhortation which is addressed to you as to sons: My son, despise not the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when you are reproved by him.
058	HEB	012	006	For, whom the Lord loves, he chastens, and scourges every son that he receives.
058	HEB	012	007	If you endure chastening, God deals with you as with sons: for what son is there whose father chastens him not?
058	HEB	012	008	But if you are without chastisement, of which all are par takers, then are you bastards, and not sons.
058	HEB	012	009	So, then, we have had fathers of our flesh who corrected us, and we reverenced them; shall we not much rather be in subjection to the Father of our spirits, and live?
058	HEB	012	010	For they, indeed, for a few days, chastened us as they thought it good; but he chastens us for our profit, that we may be partakers of his holiness.
058	HEB	012	011	But no chastisement seems, at the time, to be a matter of joy, but of grief: yet afterward, it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness to those who are exercised by it.
058	HEB	012	012	Wherefore, lift up the hands that hang down, and strengthen the feeble knees,
058	HEB	012	013	and make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned aside; but rather let it be restored to health.
058	HEB	012	014	Follow peace with all, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord;
058	HEB	012	015	taking care, lest any one slight the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness spring up and trouble you, and by this many be defiled;
058	HEB	012	016	lest there be any lewd person, or profane man, as Esau, who, for a single meal, sold his birthright.
058	HEB	012	017	For you know that afterward, when he desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no means to change his father’s mind, though he sought it earnestly with tears.
058	HEB	012	018	For you have not come to a mountain that may be touched, and that burns with fire, and to blackness and darkness and tempest,
058	HEB	012	019	and to the sound of a trumpet, and to the utterance of words, the hearing of which utterance caused the people to entreat that the word might not be spoken to them again;
058	HEB	012	020	for they could not endure that which was commanded, And if even a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned:
058	HEB	012	021	and so terrible was the sight, that even Moses said, I exceedingly fear and tremble.
058	HEB	012	022	But you have come to Mount Zion, and the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to myriads of angels;
058	HEB	012	023	to the general assembly and church of the first-born, who are enrolled in heaven, and to God, the judge of all, and to the spirits of the just made perfect,
058	HEB	012	024	and to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling that speaks better things than the blood of Abel.
058	HEB	012	025	See that you reject not him that speaks: for if they escaped not who rejected that earthly man who gave the oracles, much more shall not we escape, if we turn away from him that is from heaven,
058	HEB	012	026	whose voice then shook the earth; but now he has promised, saying, Yet once more I will shake not the earth only, but also the heaven.
058	HEB	012	027	And this prophecy, Yet once more, signifies the removing of the things that are shaken, as of things that have been made, that the things which can not be shaken may remain.
058	HEB	012	028	Wherefore, as we receive a kingdom that can not be shaken, let us have gratitude, by which we may serve God acceptably, with reverence and godly fear:
058	HEB	012	029	for our God is a consuming fire.
058	HEB	013	001	Let brotherly love continue.
058	HEB	013	002	Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for, by this means, some have unconsciously entertained angels.
058	HEB	013	003	Remember those who are in bonds, as if you yourselves had been bound, and those who suffer affliction, since you yourselves are in the body.
058	HEB	013	004	Marriage is honorable among all men, and the bed undefiled; but lewd men and adulterers God will judge.
058	HEB	013	005	Let there be no money-loving disposition; be content with such things as you have. For he has said: I will never leave you, nor will I ever forsake you.
058	HEB	013	006	So, then, we may boldly say: The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man will do to me.
058	HEB	013	007	Remember those who rule over you, who have spoken to you the word of God: attentively consider the result of their conduct, and imitate their faith.
058	HEB	013	008	Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, and to-day, and forever.
058	HEB	013	009	Be not carried away by various and strange teachings: for it is good that the heart be strengthened with grace, not with meats, which have not profited those who were occupied with them.
058	HEB	013	010	We have a sacrifice, of which those who serve the tabernacle have no right to eat.
058	HEB	013	011	For the bodies of those animals whose blood, shed for sin, is carried by the high priest into the holiest, are burned without the camp.
058	HEB	013	012	Wherefore, Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people by his own blood, suffered without the gate.
058	HEB	013	013	Therefore, let us go forth to him without the camp, bearing his reproach.
058	HEB	013	014	For here we have no abiding city, but we seek one to come.
058	HEB	013	015	Through him, therefore, let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips, giving thanks to his name.
058	HEB	013	016	But forget not to do good, and to be liberal: for with such, sacrifices God is well pleased.
058	HEB	013	017	Obey those who rule over you, and be submissive: for they watch for your souls, as those who must give an account; that they may do this with joy, and not with grief: for that would be fatal to you.
058	HEB	013	018	Pray for us: for we trust that we have a good conscience, willing to live honorably in all things.
058	HEB	013	019	And I the more earnestly entreat you to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner.
058	HEB	013	020	Now may the God of peace, who brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus Christ, the great Shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the eternal covenant,
058	HEB	013	021	perfect you in every good work, in order that you may do his will, working in you that which is acceptable in his sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory from age to age. Amen.
058	HEB	013	022	I beseech you, brethren, bear with my word of exhortation: for I have written to you in few words.
058	HEB	013	023	Know that our brother Timothy is set at liberty, with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you.
058	HEB	013	024	Salute all your rulers, and all the saints. The saints of Italy salute you.
058	HEB	013	025	Grace be with you all. Amen.

# BOOK	059	JAM	James	James
059	JAM	001	001	James, a servant of God, and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes that are in the dispersion, greeting.
059	JAM	001	002	My brethren, count it all joy, when you fall into manifold trials,
059	JAM	001	003	knowing that the trial of your faith produces patience.
059	JAM	001	004	But let patience have its work perfected, that you may be perfect and faultless, wanting in nothing.
059	JAM	001	005	Now, if any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally, and upbraids not; and it shall be given him.
059	JAM	001	006	But let him ask in faith, doubting not: for he that doubts, is like a wave of the sea, driven by the wind, and tossed.
059	JAM	001	007	For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing from the Lord.
059	JAM	001	008	A double-minded man is unstable in all his ways.
059	JAM	001	009	Let the brother that is in a lowly condition, glory in his exaltation:
059	JAM	001	010	but he that is rich, in his humiliation; because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.
059	JAM	001	011	For the sun rises with its burning heat, and withers the grass, and its flower falls, and the beauty of its form perishes. So, also, shall the rich man fade away in his ways.
059	JAM	001	012	Blessed is the man that endures trial: for, being approved, he shall receive the crown of life which the Lord has promised to those who love him.
059	JAM	001	013	Let no one say, when he is tempted, My temptation is from God; for God can not be tempted by evils, and he himself tempts no man.
059	JAM	001	014	But every one is tempted when he is drawn away by his own desire, and is deluded.
059	JAM	001	015	So, then, desire, when it has conceived, brings forth sin; and sin, when it is matured, brings forth death.
059	JAM	001	016	Be not deceived, my beloved brethren;
059	JAM	001	017	every good gift, and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no change, nor slightest trace of turning.
059	JAM	001	018	Of his own will, he begot us with the word of truth, in order that we might be, as it were, the first-fruits of his creatures.
059	JAM	001	019	So, then, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath.
059	JAM	001	020	For the wrath of man produces not the righteousness of God.
059	JAM	001	021	Wherefore, laying aside all filthiness, and every excess caused by malice, receive with meekness the ingrafted word, which is able to save your souls.
059	JAM	001	022	But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves.
059	JAM	001	023	For if any one is a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like a man that looks at his natural face in a mirror:
059	JAM	001	024	for he looks at himself, and goes away, and immediately forgets what sort of person he is.
059	JAM	001	025	But he that looks intently into the perfect law of liberty, and remains constant, being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, he shall be blessed in his deed.
059	JAM	001	026	If any one among you seems to be religious, and bridles not his tongue, but deceives his own heart, this man’s religion is vain.
059	JAM	001	027	Religion, pure and undefiled before God and the Father, is this: To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.
059	JAM	002	001	My brethren, do not hold the faith of our glorious Lord Jesus Christ, so as to show a partiality for persons.
059	JAM	002	002	For if there comes into your assembly a man in splendid apparel, and with gold rings on his fingers, and there comes in also a poor man, in mean clothing,
059	JAM	002	003	and you show regard to him that wears the splendid apparel, and say to him, Sit here, in an honorable place; and you say to the poor man, Do you stand there, or sit here, under my footstool;
059	JAM	002	004	are you not partial in yourselves? and do you not judge from false principles?
059	JAM	002	005	Hear, my beloved brethren: Has not God chosen the poor of this world, rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which God has promised to those who love him?
059	JAM	002	006	But you dishonor the poor man. Do not the rich oppress you, and do they not themselves drag you to the judgment-seats?
059	JAM	002	007	Do they not themselves revile that honorable name which is called upon you?
059	JAM	002	008	If, however, you fulfill the law of highest excellence, according to the scripture, You shall love your neighbor as yourself, you do well.
059	JAM	002	009	But if you show partiality for persons, you work sin, and are convicted by the law as transgressors.
059	JAM	002	010	For whoever shall keep the whole law, and yet fail in one, is an offender against all.
059	JAM	002	011	For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now, though you do not commit adultery, yet, if you kill, you are a transgresssor of law.
059	JAM	002	012	So speak, and so act, as those who shall be judged by the law of liberty.
059	JAM	002	013	For he shall have judgment without mercy, who has shown no mercy. Mercy glories over judgment.
059	JAM	002	014	What profit is there, my brethren, if any one say he has faith, and have not works? Can faith save him?
059	JAM	002	015	If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,
059	JAM	002	016	and any of you say to them, Go in peace, be warmed and be filled, and yet give them not the things that are needful for the body, what does this profit them?
059	JAM	002	017	So, also, faith, if it has not works, is dead, being by itself.
059	JAM	002	018	But some one will say, You have faith, and I have works; show me your faith by your works, and I will show you my faith by my works.
059	JAM	002	019	You believe that there is one God; you do well: the demons also believe, and tremble.
059	JAM	002	020	But will you know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?
059	JAM	002	021	Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he offered his son Isaac on the altar?
059	JAM	002	022	Do you see that faith was the moving principle in his works, and by works his faith was made perfect?
059	JAM	002	023	And the scripture was fulfilled, which says, Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness: and he was called the friend of God.
059	JAM	002	024	Do you see that a man is justified by works, and not by faith only?
059	JAM	002	025	Likewise, was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and sent them out another way?
059	JAM	002	026	For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.
059	JAM	003	001	My brethren, be not many teachers, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation.
059	JAM	003	002	For in many things we all offend. If any one offends not in word, he is a perfect man, able also to bridle the whole body.
059	JAM	003	003	Behold, we put bits into horses mouths that they may obey us, and we turn about their whole body.
059	JAM	003	004	Behold also the ships, which are very great, and are driven by violent winds; yet they are turned about by a very small helm, to whatever point the will of him that directs it may determine.
059	JAM	003	005	So, also, the tongue is a little member, and boasts great things. Behold, how great a forest does a little fire set in a blaze.
059	JAM	003	006	And the tongue is a fire, the world of iniquity. So is the tongue placed among our members, defiling the whole body, setting on fire the course of life, and being set on fire by hell.
059	JAM	003	007	For every kind of beasts and of birds, of creeping things and of things in the sea, is tamed, and has been tamed by man:
059	JAM	003	008	but the tongue no man can tame; it is an unruly evil; it is full of deadly poison.
059	JAM	003	009	With it we bless God, even the Father: and with it we curse men, who are made in the likeness of God.
059	JAM	003	010	Out of the same mouth come forth blessing and cursing. These things, my brethren, ought not so to be.
059	JAM	003	011	Does a fountain send forth from the same cavern sweet water and bitter?
059	JAM	003	012	Can the fig-tree, my brethren, bear olives, or the vine, figs? So no fountain can produce salt water and fresh.
059	JAM	003	013	Who is wise and discreet among you? Let him show, by a good behavior, his works, with the meekness of wisdom.
059	JAM	003	014	But if you have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth.
059	JAM	003	015	This wisdom comes not from above, but is earthly, animal, demoniac.
059	JAM	003	016	For where envy and strife are, there is commotion, and every evil work.
059	JAM	003	017	But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.
059	JAM	003	018	And those who cultivate peace, sow for themselves a harvest of righteousness in peace.
059	JAM	004	001	Whence come wars and strifes among you? Come they not hence, even of your passions, which war in your members?
059	JAM	004	002	You desire, and you have not; you kill, and are earnestly desirous of having, and yet you can not obtain; you fight and war, and yet you have not, because you ask not.
059	JAM	004	003	You ask, and receive not, because you ask amiss, that you may spend it on your passions.
059	JAM	004	004	Adulterers and adulteresses, know you not that the friendship of the world is enmity to God? Whoever, therefore, will be a friend of the world, is an enemy of God.
059	JAM	004	005	Do you suppose that the scripture speaks to no purpose? Does the Spirit that dwells in us incline to envy? No.
059	JAM	004	006	But he gives more grace. Wherefore he says: God sets himself against the proud, but gives grace to the lowly.
059	JAM	004	007	Submit yourselves, therefore, to God; resist the devil, and he will flee from you;
059	JAM	004	008	draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded men.
059	JAM	004	009	Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to sorrow.
059	JAM	004	010	Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he will exalt you.
059	JAM	004	011	Do not speak evil one of another, brethren. He that speaks evil of his brother, and judges his brother, speaks evil of the law, and judges the law: but if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law, but a judge.
059	JAM	004	012	There is one law-giver that is able to save, and to destroy: who are you that judge another?
059	JAM	004	013	Come, now, you that say, Let us go to-day, or to-morrow, into this city, and remain there a year, and trade, and make gain;
059	JAM	004	014	and yet you know not what will take place to-morrow. For what is your life? Is it not, indeed, a vapor, that appears for a little while, and then vanishes away?
059	JAM	004	015	Instead of that, you ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that.
059	JAM	004	016	But now you glory in your boastings: all such glorying is evil.
059	JAM	004	017	Therefore, to him that knows how to do good, and does it not, to him it is sin.
059	JAM	005	001	Come, now, you rich men, weep and lament for your miseries that are coming upon you.
059	JAM	005	002	Your wealth is corrupted, and your garments are moth-eaten:
059	JAM	005	003	your gold and your silver are covered with rust; and their rust will be a testimony against you, and will eat your flesh as fire. You have heaped up treasures in the last days.
059	JAM	005	004	Behold, the hire of the laborers who have reaped your fields, which has been unjustly withheld by you, cries out: and the cries of those who have reaped, have entered into the ears of the Lord of hosts.
059	JAM	005	005	You have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; you have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter.
059	JAM	005	006	You have condemned and killed the Just One: and he does not set himself against you.
059	JAM	005	007	Be patient, therefore, brethren, till the coming of the Lord. Behold, the farmer looks for the precious fruit of the earth, and waits patiently for it, till he receives the early and the latter rain.
059	JAM	005	008	Be you also patient, establish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draws near.
059	JAM	005	009	Indulge not in complaints against one another, brethren, lest you be condemned: behold, the judge stands before the door.
059	JAM	005	010	Take, my brethren, the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord, as an example of suffering evil, and of patience.
059	JAM	005	011	Behold, we count those happy who endure. You have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the final dealing of the Lord, that the Lord is very compassionate and merciful.
059	JAM	005	012	But above all things, my brethren, swear not, either by heaven, or by the earth, or with any other oath: but let your yes, be yes, and your no, be no, lest you fall into condemnation.
059	JAM	005	013	Is any one among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any one cheerful? let him sing praise.
059	JAM	005	014	Is any one among you sick? let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil, in the name of the Lord.
059	JAM	005	015	And the prayer of faith shall save the sick; and the Lord will raise him up. And if he has committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.
059	JAM	005	016	Confess your faults one to another, and pray for one another, that you may be restored to health: the fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much.
059	JAM	005	017	Elijah was a man with passions like our own; and he earnestly prayed that it might not rain; and it did not rain on the land for three years and six months.
059	JAM	005	018	And he prayed again; and the heavens gave rain, and the earth brought forth its fruit.
059	JAM	005	019	Brethren, if any among you should err from the truth, and one should turn him back,
059	JAM	005	020	let him know that he who turns back a sinner from the error of his way, will save a soul from death, and cover a multitude of sins.

# BOOK	060	1PE	1 Peter	1 Peter
060	1PE	001	001	Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the sojourners that are dispersed through Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,
060	1PE	001	002	elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, by the sanctification of the Spirit, in order to obedience, and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: grace be to you, and peace be multiplied.
060	1PE	001	003	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who, according to his abundant mercy, has, by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, regenerated us for a living hope
060	1PE	001	004	in respect to an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fades not away, reserved in heaven for us,
060	1PE	001	005	who are kept secure by the power of God through faith, to a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time:
060	1PE	001	006	in which you rejoice, though now for a little while, since it is needful, you are in sorrow under various temptations;
060	1PE	001	007	that your faith, when proved, being much more precious than gold, which perishes though it be tried by fire, may be found to be for praise and honor and glory, at the revelation of Jesus Christ;
060	1PE	001	008	whom, though you have not seen him, yet you love; on whom not now looking, but believing, you rejoice with joy unspeakable, and full of glory,
060	1PE	001	009	receiving the end of your faith, the salvation of your souls.
060	1PE	001	010	Concerning which salvation the prophets that prophesied of the grace that should be for you, did inquire, and search diligently,
060	1PE	001	011	inquiring what things, and what time, the Spirit of Christ that was in them did signify, when it testified, beforehand, the sufferings of Christ, and the glories that should follow them;
060	1PE	001	012	to whom it was revealed, that, not for themselves, but for us, they ministered the things that are now preached to you by those who have made known to you the gospel, through the Holy Spirit sent down from heaven; into which things angels desire to look.
060	1PE	001	013	Wherefore, gird up the loins of your mind; be watchful, and hope constantly for the grace that is to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ:
060	1PE	001	014	as obedient children, not conforming yourselves to the desires which you formerly had in your ignorance;
060	1PE	001	015	but as he who has called you is holy, so be you holy in all your behavior:
060	1PE	001	016	because it is written, Be you holy, for I am holy.
060	1PE	001	017	And since you call on the Father, who, without respect of persons, judges according to every man’s work, pass the time of your sojourning in fear:
060	1PE	001	018	because you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver or gold, from your vain mode of life received by tradition from your fathers,
060	1PE	001	019	but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without spot and blemish,
060	1PE	001	020	who was indeed foreordained before the foundation of the world, but manifested in these last times for you,
060	1PE	001	021	who through him do believe in God who raised him from the dead, and gave him glory, that your faith and hope might be in God.
060	1PE	001	022	Having purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit, to unfeigned love of the brethren, love one another with a pure heart fervently,
060	1PE	001	023	having been begotten again, not with corruptible seed, but with incorruptible, by the word of God, which lives and abides forever.
060	1PE	001	024	For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass; the grass withers, and its flower fails away:
060	1PE	001	025	but the word of the Lord abides forever: and this is the word which has been preached as gospel to you.
060	1PE	002	001	Therefore, laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envyings, and all evil speakings,
060	1PE	002	002	as new-born babes, earnestly desire the pure spiritual milk, that you may grow by it,
060	1PE	002	003	if; indeed, you have tasted that the Lord is gracious.
060	1PE	002	004	Coming to him as to a living stone, rejected indeed by man, but in the sight of God, chosen and precious,
060	1PE	002	005	you, also, as living stones, are built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, that you may offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
060	1PE	002	006	For it is contained in the scripture: Behold, I lay in Zion a chief corner-stone, chosen, precious; and he that believes on him shall not be ashamed.
060	1PE	002	007	To you, then, who believe, is this preciousness: but the stone which the builders rejected, has become the head of the corner,
060	1PE	002	008	and a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense to the disobedient, who stumble at the word because they are disobedient, to which stumbling they were also appointed.
060	1PE	002	009	But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a purchased people, that you should show forth the virtues of him who has called you out of darkness into his wonderful light:
060	1PE	002	010	who formerly were not a people, but now are the people of God; who had not received mercy, but now have received mercy.
060	1PE	002	011	Beloved, I beseech you, as strangers and sojourners, that you keep yourselves from fleshly desires, which war against the soul,
060	1PE	002	012	maintaining an honorable mode of life am one the Gentiles, that, inasmuch as they speak against you as evil-doers, they may, on account of your good works which they witness, glorify God in the day of visitation.
060	1PE	002	013	Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man, for the Lord’s sake; whether it be to the king, as supreme ruler,
060	1PE	002	014	or to governors, as those sent by him for the punishment of evil-doers, and for the praise of those who do well.
060	1PE	002	015	For such is the will of God, that by doing good you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men;
060	1PE	002	016	as being free, and yet not using your freedom as a cloak for malice, but as servants of God.
060	1PE	002	017	Honor all men; love the brotherhood; reverence God; honor the king.
060	1PE	002	018	Servants, be subject to your masters with all respect; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the perverse.
060	1PE	002	019	For this is praiseworthy, if any one, on account of conscience toward God, endure sorrows, suffering unjustly.
060	1PE	002	020	For what praise is due, if, when you are punished for your faults, you endure it patiently? But if, when you do well, and suffer for it, you endure it patiently, this is praiseworthy in the sight of God.
060	1PE	002	021	To this, indeed, you have been called; because even Christ suffered for us, leaving you an example, that you should follow his footsteps.
060	1PE	002	022	He did no sin, nor was guile found in his mouth.
060	1PE	002	023	When he was reviled, he did not revile again; when he suffered, he did not threaten, but committed himself to him that judges righteously.
060	1PE	002	024	He himself bore our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, having died to sins, might live to righteousness. By his stripes you were healed.
060	1PE	002	025	For you were like sheep that had gone astray; but now you have returned to the shepherd and bishop of your souls.
060	1PE	003	001	Likewise, you wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they may, without the word, be won by the conduct of their wives,
060	1PE	003	002	by observing your blameless and reverential conduct.
060	1PE	003	003	Let not your adorning be that which is outward, which consists in plaiting the hair, and wearing gold, and putting on apparel:
060	1PE	003	004	but let it be the hidden man of the heart, adorned with the incorruptible ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which, in the sight of God, is of great price.
060	1PE	003	005	For, in former times, the holy women also, who trusted in God, thus adorned themselves, being in subjection to their own husbands,
060	1PE	003	006	as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: and you are her children, if you do good, and fear no dismay.
060	1PE	003	007	Likewise, you husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, bestowing honor on the wife as the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life, in order that your prayers may not be hindered.
060	1PE	003	008	Finally, be all of the same mind, be sympathizing, lovers of the brethren, kind-hearted, humble-minded;
060	1PE	003	009	not repaying evil for evil, nor reviling for reviling, but, on the other hand, blessing, since you know that for this end you were called, that you might inherit blessing.
060	1PE	003	010	For he that will love life, and see good days, let him keep his tongue from evil, and his lips from speaking guile:
060	1PE	003	011	let him turn from evil and do good: let him seek peace, and pursue it.
060	1PE	003	012	For the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and his ears are open to their cry: but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.
060	1PE	003	013	And who is he that will harm you, if you be followers of that which is good?
060	1PE	003	014	But yet, if you even suffer for righteousness, happy are you. Yet fear not their terror, nor be troubled:
060	1PE	003	015	but reverence the Lord God in your hearts, and be always ready to answer every one that asks of you a reason for the hope that is in you, with meekness and fear;
060	1PE	003	016	having a good conscience, that, inasmuch as they speak against you as evil-doers, they may be ashamed who traduce your good con duct in Christ.
060	1PE	003	017	For it is better, if such be the will of God, that you suffer for doing good, than for doing evil.
060	1PE	003	018	For Christ also once suffered for sins, the Just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, having been put to death in flesh, but made alive in spirit;
060	1PE	003	019	in which also he went and preached to the spirits in prison,
060	1PE	003	020	who formerly were disobedient, when the long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while an ark was preparing, in which few, that is, eight souls, were brought in safety through the water;
060	1PE	003	021	the likeness of which, even immersion, (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the seeking of a good conscience toward God, ) does now also save us, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,
060	1PE	003	022	who has gone into heaven, and is at the right hand of God, angels and authorities and powers having become subject to him.
060	1PE	004	001	Since, then, Christ has suffered for us in the flesh, do you also arm yourselves with the same determination; for he that has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin,
060	1PE	004	002	so that he no longer lives the rest of his time in the flesh, according to the desires of men, but according to the will of God.
060	1PE	004	003	For the time past of our life should be enough for us to have worked the will of the Gentiles, while we walked in licentiousness, lusts, drunkenness, revelings, drinkings, and unlawful idolatries.
060	1PE	004	004	They are amazed at this―that you run not with them into the same excess of debauchery, and they revile you.
060	1PE	004	005	These shall give an account to him that is ready to judge the living and the dead.
060	1PE	004	006	For this cause, indeed, even those who have died had the gospel preached to them, that though they might be judged according to the will of men in the flesh, yet they might live according to the will of God in the spirit.
060	1PE	004	007	But the end of all things is at hand; be sober-minded, therefore, and watchful, that you may pray.
060	1PE	004	008	But, above all things, have fervent love one for another; for love will cover a multitude of sins.
060	1PE	004	009	Be hospitable, one to another, without murmuring.
060	1PE	004	010	As each has received a gift, minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.
060	1PE	004	011	If any man speaks, let him speak as the oracles of God: if any man acts as a deacon, let him do this as from the strength which God supplies; that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and strength from age to age. Amen.
060	1PE	004	012	Beloved, be not amazed at the fiery trial that has come on you to try you, as if some strange thing had happened to you.
060	1PE	004	013	But, inasmuch as you are partakers of the sufferings of the Christ, rejoice, that, at the revelation of his glory, you may also be exceedingly joyful.
060	1PE	004	014	If you are reproached on account of Christ, happy are you: for the glorious Spirit of God rests upon you. On their part he is reviled, but on your part he is glorified:
060	1PE	004	015	for no one of you should suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or an evil-doer, or as a busybody in other men’s matters.
060	1PE	004	016	But if any one suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God on this account.
060	1PE	004	017	For the time has come that judgment must begin at the house of God; and if it begin first at us, what shall be the end of those who obey not the gospel of God?
060	1PE	004	018	And if the righteous man is hardly saved, where shall the ungodly man and the sinner appear?
060	1PE	004	019	Wherefore, let those also who suffer according to the will of God, by doing good, commit their souls to him as to a faithful Creator.
060	1PE	005	001	The elders that are among you I exhort, who am a fellow-elder, and a witness of the sufferings of the Christ, and a sharer in the glory that is to be revealed.
060	1PE	005	002	Act as shepherds to the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight, not by compulsion, but willingly; not for the sake of sordid gain, but from readiness of mind:
060	1PE	005	003	neither as being lords over God’s possessions, but being examples to the flock.
060	1PE	005	004	And when the chief shepherd shall appear, you shall receive the crown of glory that fades not away.
060	1PE	005	005	Likewise, you younger, be in subjection to the older: do you all indeed be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resists the proud, but gives grace to the lowly.
060	1PE	005	006	Humble yourselves, therefore, under the strong hand of God, that he may exalt you in due season.
060	1PE	005	007	Cast all your cares on him, for he cares for you.
060	1PE	005	008	Be sober, be watchful: for your adversary, the devil, like a roaring lion, walks about, seeking whom he may devour.
060	1PE	005	009	Being firm in the faith, resist him, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren who are in the world.
060	1PE	005	010	But may the God of all grace, who has called us to his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after you have suffered a while, make you perfect, establish, strengthen, confirm you.
060	1PE	005	011	To him be glory and dominion from age to age. Amen.
060	1PE	005	012	By Sylvanus, a faithful brother to you, as I suppose, I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God in which you stand.
060	1PE	005	013	The church in Babylon, elected together with you, salutes you, and so does Marcus my son.
060	1PE	005	014	Salute one another with a kiss of love. Peace be with you all that are in Christ Jesus.

# BOOK	061	2PE	2 Peter	2 Peter
061	2PE	001	001	Simon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who have obtained faith, equally as precious as our own, in the plan of justification revealed by our God and Savior Jesus Christ:
061	2PE	001	002	grace be to you, and peace be multiplied in the acknowledgment of God, and Jesus our Lord.
061	2PE	001	003	As his divine power has given us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the acknowledgment of him who has called us by his glorious power,
061	2PE	001	004	through which things very great and precious favors that were promised have been given us, that through these you may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through desire:
061	2PE	001	005	so, even for this very purpose, uniting to these things all diligence, add to your faith, virtue; and to virtue, knowledge;
061	2PE	001	006	and to knowledge, temperance; and to temperance, patience; and to patience, godliness;
061	2PE	001	007	and to godliness, brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness, love.
061	2PE	001	008	For if these things be in you, and abound, they cause you to be neither idle, nor unfruitful as it respects the acknowledgment of our Lord Jesus Christ.
061	2PE	001	009	But he who is wanting in these things is blind, and closes his eyes, and has forgotten that he was cleansed from his old sins.
061	2PE	001	010	Wherefore, brethren, give the greater diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if you do these things, you will never fall.
061	2PE	001	011	For thus will an entrance be given you abundantly into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
061	2PE	001	012	Wherefore, I will not neglect to remind you always of these things, though you know them, and are established in the present truth.
061	2PE	001	013	Indeed, I think it right, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to arouse you by putting you in remembrance.
061	2PE	001	014	For I know that the putting off of this my tabernacle is near at hand, even as our Lord Jesus Christ showed me.
061	2PE	001	015	But I will earnestly endeavor that you may be able, even after my decease, to have these things always in remembrance.
061	2PE	001	016	For we did not follow cunningly devised fables, when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ; but we were eye-witnesses of his majesty.
061	2PE	001	017	For he received from God the Father honor and glory, when there came to him from the magnificent glory a voice, such as this: This is my beloved Son, in whom I delight.
061	2PE	001	018	And this voice, which came from heaven, we heard when we were with him in the holy mount;
061	2PE	001	019	and we have the prophetic word better established. You do well to attend to this, as to a lamp that shines in a dark place, till the day dawn, and the morning star arise in your hearts;
061	2PE	001	020	knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture came from private interpretation:
061	2PE	001	021	for the prophecy came not at any time by the will of man, but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Spirit.
061	2PE	002	001	But there were false prophets among the people, as there will be false teachers also among you; and these will stealthily introduce ruinous sects, and deny the Lord that bought them, bringing upon themselves swift destruction:
061	2PE	002	002	and many will follow their dissolute ways, on account of whom the way of truth will be reviled;
061	2PE	002	003	and, with delusive words, they will, through covetousness, make gain of you: the condemnation, long ago denounced against these, delays not, and their destruction does not slumber.
061	2PE	002	004	For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to Tartarus, and delivered them over to chains of darkness, to be kept for judgment;
061	2PE	002	005	and if he spared not the old world, but brought a flood on the world of the ungodly, and saved Noah, the eighth person, who was a preacher of righteousness;
061	2PE	002	006	and if, turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes, he condemned them with an overthrow, making them an example to those who should afterward live in an ungodly manner,
061	2PE	002	007	and delivered righteous Lot, wearied out with the licentious conduct of the lawless, ―
061	2PE	002	008	for that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds:
061	2PE	002	009	then, the Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptation, and to keep the ungodly for the day of judgment, to be punished;
061	2PE	002	010	but especially those who walk after the flesh in unclean lust, and who despise government. Presumptuous, willful men! they are not afraid to speak evil of dignitaries:
061	2PE	002	011	whereas angels, who excel in might and in power, bring no railing accusation against them in the presence of the Lord.
061	2PE	002	012	But these men, like beasts with out reason, which follow the instinct of nature, and are made to be taken and destroyed, speaking evil of things that they understand not, shall utterly perish in their own corruption,
061	2PE	002	013	and receive the reward of unrighteousness. Counting it a pleasure to riot in the day-time, they are spots and stains, rioting in their delusions, while feasting with you;
061	2PE	002	014	having eyes that are full of the adulteress, and that can not cease from sin, deceiving unstable souls, having a heart exercised in covetousness, accursed children,
061	2PE	002	015	who have forsaken the right way and gone astray, following the way of Balaam the son of Beor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness;
061	2PE	002	016	but he was rebuked for his iniquity, ―the dumb beast, speaking with man’s voice, restrained the madness of the prophet.
061	2PE	002	017	These men are fountains without water, clouds driven by a tempest, for whom the gloom of darkness is reserved forever.
061	2PE	002	018	For by speaking boastful words of folly, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, and through lasciviousness, those who had really escaped from those who live in error.
061	2PE	002	019	While they promise them freedom, they themselves are the servants of corruption: for by whatever any man is overcome, he is also enslaved.
061	2PE	002	020	For if, after they have escaped the pollutions of the world, through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in these, and overcome by them, the last state of such is worse than the first.
061	2PE	002	021	For it would be better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after having known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered to them.
061	2PE	002	022	But it has happened to them according to the true proverb: The dog has turned again to his own vomit; and, The sow that was washed, to her wallowing in the mire.
061	2PE	003	001	This second letter I now write to you, beloved; in both of these I arouse your pure mind to remembrance,
061	2PE	003	002	that you may be mindful of the words formerly spoken by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Savior:
061	2PE	003	003	knowing this first, that there will come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts,
061	2PE	003	004	and saying: Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.
061	2PE	003	005	For they are willingly ignorant of this, that by the word of God, the heavens of old had their being as also the earth consisting of water and subsisting by water,
061	2PE	003	006	by which things the world that then was, having been overflowed with water, perished.
061	2PE	003	007	But the heavens and the earth that now are, by the same word are kept in store, reserved for fire against the day of judgment, and perdition of ungodly men.
061	2PE	003	008	But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day with the Lord is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.
061	2PE	003	009	The Lord does not delay concerning his promise, as some men count delay, but he is long-suffering toward us, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.
061	2PE	003	010	But the day of the Lord will come as a thief, in which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, and the earth, and the works that are on it, shall be burned up.
061	2PE	003	011	Seeing, then, that all these things shall be dissolved, what sort of persons ought you to be in all holy behavior, and godliness,
061	2PE	003	012	looking for and earnestly desiring the coming of the day of God, because of which coming the heavens shall dis solve in fire, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat.
061	2PE	003	013	But we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, in which dwells righteousness.
061	2PE	003	014	Wherefore, beloved, seeing that you expect such things, earnestly strive, by being spotless and blameless, to be found by him in peace:
061	2PE	003	015	and count the long-suffering of our Lord, salvation, even as our beloved brother Paul, according to the wisdom given him, has written to you;
061	2PE	003	016	as also in all his letters, speaking in them of these things, in which are some things hard to be understood, which the unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, to their own destruction.
061	2PE	003	017	Do you, therefore, beloved, since you know these things beforehand, beware, lest, being led away with the error of the wicked, you fall from your own steadfastness.
061	2PE	003	018	But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and to the day of eternity. Amen.

062	1JO	001	001	That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled concerning the Word of life;
062	1JO	001	002	(the life also was manifested, and we have seen, and do testify, and declare to you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested to us; )
062	1JO	001	003	that which we have seen and heard, we declare it to you, that you also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.
062	1JO	001	004	And these things we write to you, that your joy may be full.
062	1JO	001	005	And this is the message that we heard from him, and do declare to you: that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.
062	1JO	001	006	If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth.
062	1JO	001	007	But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanses us from all sin.
062	1JO	001	008	If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.
062	1JO	001	009	If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just, so that he will forgive us our sins, and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
062	1JO	001	010	If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.
062	1JO	002	001	My little children, I write these things to you, that you may not sin: and yet, if any one sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.
062	1JO	002	002	And he is the expiation for our sins: not for ours only, but for the sins of the whole world.
062	1JO	002	003	And by this we know that we do know him, if we keep his commandments.
062	1JO	002	004	He that says, I know him, and keeps not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.
062	1JO	002	005	But whoever keeps his word, in him truly is the love of God perfected: by this we know that we are in him.
062	1JO	002	006	He that says, he abides in him, ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.
062	1JO	002	007	Beloved, I write no new commandment to you, but an old commandment, which you have had from the beginning; the old commandment is the word, which you have heard from the beginning.
062	1JO	002	008	Again, a new commandment I do write to you, which is true as it respects him and you; because the darkness is past, and the true light now shines.
062	1JO	002	009	He that says he is in the light, and hates his brother, is in darkness till now.
062	1JO	002	010	He that loves his brother abides in the light, and there is in him no cause for offense.
062	1JO	002	011	He that hates his brother is in darkness, and walks in darkness; and he knows not whither he goes, because darkness has blinded his eyes.
062	1JO	002	012	I write to you, little children, because your sins are forgiven for his name’s sake.
062	1JO	002	013	I write to you, fathers, because you have known him that is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you have overcome the wicked one. I write to you, my little children, because you have known the Father.
062	1JO	002	014	I have written to you, fathers, because you have known him that is from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the wicked one.
062	1JO	002	015	Love not the world, nor the things that are in the world. If any man loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.
062	1JO	002	016	For all that is in the world, the desire of the flesh, and the desire of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.
062	1JO	002	017	And the world and its desire passes away: but he that does the will of God, abides forever.
062	1JO	002	018	Little children, it is the last time; and, as you have heard that the antichrist is coming, even now there are many antichrists; by which we know that it is the last time.
062	1JO	002	019	They went out from us, but they were not of us: for, if they had been of us, they would have remained with us; but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us.
062	1JO	002	020	And you have an anointing from the Holy One, and know all things.
062	1JO	002	021	I have not written to you because you do not know the truth, but because you know it, and because no lie is of the truth.
062	1JO	002	022	Who is a liar, but he that denies that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, who denies the Father and the Son.
062	1JO	002	023	Whoever denies the Son, has not the Father: he that confesses the Son, has the Father also.
062	1JO	002	024	Let that, therefore, abide in you which you have heard from the beginning. If that abide in you which you have heard from the beginning, you also shall abide in the Son and in the Father.
062	1JO	002	025	And this is the promise which he has promised us, even eternal life.
062	1JO	002	026	I have written these things to you concerning those who deceive you.
062	1JO	002	027	And the anointing which you have received from him abides in you; and you have no need that any one should teach you: but, as the same anointing teaches you concerning all things, and is true and is no lie, even as it has taught you, abide in it.
062	1JO	002	028	And now, little children, abide in him, that when he appears, we may have confidence, and may not be made ashamed by him at his coming.
062	1JO	002	029	If you know that he is righteous, you know that every one that works righteousness has been begotten by him.
062	1JO	003	001	Behold, how great love the Father has bestowed on us, that we should be called the children of God! For this reason, the world knows us not, because it knew him not.
062	1JO	003	002	Beloved, now are we the children of God, and it does not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.
062	1JO	003	003	And every one that has this hope in Him purifies himself, even as He is pure.
062	1JO	003	004	Every one that works sin, works also transgression of law: and sin is transgression of law.
062	1JO	003	005	And you know that he was manifested, that he might take away our sins; and in him there is no sin.
062	1JO	003	006	Whoever abides in him, sins not. Whoever sins, has neither seen him nor known him.
062	1JO	003	007	Little children, let no one deceive you: he that works righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.
062	1JO	003	008	He that works sin is of the devil, for the devil sins from the beginning: for this purpose was the son of God manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.
062	1JO	003	009	Whoever has been begotten of God does not work sin; because his seed remains in him: and he can not sin, because he has been begotten of God.
062	1JO	003	010	By this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil. Whoever does not work righteousness is not of God; neither is he that loves not his brother.
062	1JO	003	011	For this is the message that you have heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.
062	1JO	003	012	Not as Cain, who was of the wicked one, and slew his brother: and for what reason did he slay him? because his own works were evil, and his brother’s, righteous.
062	1JO	003	013	Wonder not, my brethren, if the world hates you.
062	1JO	003	014	We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren: he that loves not his brother, abides in death.
062	1JO	003	015	Whoever hates his brother, is a murderer: and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.
062	1JO	003	016	By this we know the love of Christ, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.
062	1JO	003	017	Whoever has this world’s goods, and sees his brother have need, and shuts his heart against him, how dwells the love of God in him?
062	1JO	003	018	My little children, let us not love in word, nor in tongue, but in deed, and in truth.
062	1JO	003	019	And by this we know that we are of the truth; and we shall have our hearts at rest before him:
062	1JO	003	020	for if our heart condemn us, we know that God is greater than our heart, and knows all things.
062	1JO	003	021	Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, we have confidence toward God,
062	1JO	003	022	and whatever we ask, we receive from him, because we keep his commandments, and do the things that are pleasing in his sight.
062	1JO	003	023	And this is his commandment: That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.
062	1JO	003	024	And he that keeps his commandments abides in him, and he in him. And by this we know that he abides in us, by the Spirit which he has given us.
062	1JO	004	001	Beloved, believe not every spirit; but prove the spirits, whether they are from God: for many false prophets have gone out into the world.
062	1JO	004	002	By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ came in the flesh, is from God:
062	1JO	004	003	and whatever spirit confesses not that Jesus Christ came in the flesh, is not from God: and this is the spirit of antichrist, of which you have heard that it comes, and is now already in the world.
062	1JO	004	004	You are of God, little children, and have overcome them; because he that is in you, is greater than he that is in the world.
062	1JO	004	005	They are of the world: therefore, they speak of the world, and the world hears them.
062	1JO	004	006	We are of God: he that knows God, hears us: he that is not of God, does not hear us: by this we know the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.
062	1JO	004	007	Beloved, let us love one another; for love is of God: and every one that loves, has been begotten of God, and knows God.
062	1JO	004	008	He that loves not, does not know God; for God is love.
062	1JO	004	009	In this the love of God was manifested toward us, that God sent his only-begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.
062	1JO	004	010	In this is love; not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the expiation for our sins.
062	1JO	004	011	Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.
062	1JO	004	012	No one has seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwells in us, and his love is perfected in us.
062	1JO	004	013	By this we know that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit.
062	1JO	004	014	And we have seen, and we do testify, that the Father sent the Son to be the Savior of the world.
062	1JO	004	015	Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwells in him, and he in God.
062	1JO	004	016	And we have known and believed the love which God has for us. God is love; and he that dwells in love, dwells in God, and God in him.
062	1JO	004	017	By this is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment; because, as he is, so are we in this world.
062	1JO	004	018	There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear, because fear has torment: he that fears is not made perfect in love.
062	1JO	004	019	We love him, because he first loved us.
062	1JO	004	020	If any man say, I love God, and yet hate his brother, he is a liar: for he that loves not his brother, whom he has seen, how can he love God whom he has not seen?
062	1JO	004	021	And this commandment we have from him: That he that loves God, must love his brother also.
062	1JO	005	001	Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ, has been begotten of God: and every one that loves him that begot, loves him also that is begotten of him.
062	1JO	005	002	By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his commandments.
062	1JO	005	003	For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments; and his commandments are not burdensome.
062	1JO	005	004	For whatever is begotten of God, overcomes the world; and this is the victorious principle that overcomes the world, even our faith.
062	1JO	005	005	Who is he that overcomes the world, but he that believes that Jesus is the Son of God?
062	1JO	005	006	This is he that came by water and by blood, Jesus the Christ; not by water only, but by water and by blood: and it is the Spirit that testifies, because the Spirit is truth.
062	1JO	005	007	For there are three that testify, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood;
062	1JO	005	008	and the three agree in one.
062	1JO	005	009	If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater: for this is the testimony of God, which he has borne concerning his Son.
062	1JO	005	010	He that believes on the Son of God has the testimony in himself: he that believes not God, has made him a liar, because he has not believed the testimony which God has borne concerning his Son.
062	1JO	005	011	And this is the testimony, that God has given us eternal life: and this life is in his Son.
062	1JO	005	012	He that has the Son, has life: he that has not the Son of God, has not life.
062	1JO	005	013	I have written these things to you that believe on the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life, and that you may believe on the name of the Son of God.
062	1JO	005	014	And this is the confidence that we have toward him, that if we ask any thing according to his will, he hears us.
062	1JO	005	015	And if we know that he hears us, whatever we ask, we know that we have the petitions which we have asked of him.
062	1JO	005	016	If any one see his brother sinning a sin not to death, he shall ask, and he will give him life for those who sin not to death. There is a sin to death: I do not say concerning this, that he should ask.
062	1JO	005	017	All unrighteousness is sin; and there is a sin not to death.
062	1JO	005	018	We know that whoever has been begotten of God, does not sin: but he that is begotten of God, keeps himself, and the wicked one touches him not.
062	1JO	005	019	We know that we are of God, and the whole world lies under the wicked one.
062	1JO	005	020	And we know that the Son of God has come, and has given us understanding, that we may know him that is true: and we are in him that is true, in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and life eternal.
062	1JO	005	021	Little children, keep yourselves from idols.

063	2JO	001	001	The elder to the elect lady, and to her children, whom I love in the truth: and not I only, but also all who know the truth;
063	2JO	001	002	we all love you, on account of the truth that dwells in us, and which will be with us forever:
063	2JO	001	003	grace be with you, mercy and peace from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.
063	2JO	001	004	I rejoiced greatly because I found some of your children walking in the truth, as we received commandment from the Father.
063	2JO	001	005	And now I beseech you, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment to you, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.
063	2JO	001	006	And this is love, that we walk according to his commandments. This is the commandment, as you have heard from the beginning, that you should walk in it.
063	2JO	001	007	For many deceivers have entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ came in the flesh: this is the deceiver and the antichrist.
063	2JO	001	008	Look to yourselves, that we lose not the things that we have gained, but that we receive a full reward.
063	2JO	001	009	Whoever transgresses, and abides not in the teaching of the Christ, has not God: he that abides in the teaching of the Christ, has both the Father and the Son.
063	2JO	001	010	If any one comes to you, and brings not this teaching, receive him not into your house, and do not wish him well:
063	2JO	001	011	for he that wishes him well, is partaker of his evil deeds.
063	2JO	001	012	Though I have many things to write to you, I determined not to communicate them by means of paper and ink: for I hope to come to you, and to speak mouth to mouth, that our joy may be full.

064	3JO	001	001	The elder to the beloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth.
064	3JO	001	002	Beloved, I pray above all things that you may prosper and be in health, even as your soul prospers.
064	3JO	001	003	For I rejoiced greatly when the brethren came and testified to the truth that is in you, even as you walk in the truth.
064	3JO	001	004	I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in the truth.
064	3JO	001	005	Beloved, you do faithfully whatever you do to the brethren, and to strangers,
064	3JO	001	006	who have testified to your love before the church: if you conduct these on their journey, in a manner worthy of God, you will do well:
064	3JO	001	007	for, on account of his name, they went out, taking nothing from the Gentiles.
064	3JO	001	008	We, therefore, ought to receive such, that we may be fellow-helpers to the truth.
064	3JO	001	009	I wrote to the church; but Diotrephes, who loves to have the pre-eminence among them, receives us not.
064	3JO	001	010	Therefore, if I come, I will remember his works which he does, prating against us with malicious words: and not content with these things, he does not himself receive the brethren, but both forbids those who are willing, and casts them out of the church.
064	3JO	001	011	Beloved, do not imitate that which is evil, but that which is good. He that does good is of God: he that does evil has not seen God.
064	3JO	001	012	A good report is given of Demetrius by all, and by the truth itself: and we also give our testimony, and you know that our testimony is true.
064	3JO	001	013	I had many things to write, but I will not communicate them to you with ink and pen.
064	3JO	001	014	But I trust that I shall shortly see you, and we will speak mouth to mouth. Peace be to you. Our friends here salute you. Salute our friends with you by name.

# BOOK	065	JUD	Jude	Jude
065	JUD	001	001	Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to those who are sanctified in God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ, and called:
065	JUD	001	002	mercy be to you, and peace and love be multiplied.
065	JUD	001	003	Beloved, using all diligence to write to you of the common salvation, I thought it necessary to write to you, and exhort you to contend earnestly for the faith once delivered to the saints.
065	JUD	001	004	For some men have stealthily entered in, who were long ago appointed to this condemnation; ungodly men, who pervert the grace of our God, and use it for lascivious purposes, and deny our only Sovereign and Lord, Jesus Christ.
065	JUD	001	005	But I wish to remind you, though you once knew this, that the Lord, having saved the people from the land of Egypt, then destroyed those who believed not.
065	JUD	001	006	The angels also that kept not their own dominion, but left their proper habitation, he has reserved, in eternal chains under darkness, to the judgment of the great day.
065	JUD	001	007	So Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities which were about them, in like manner giving themselves over to lewdness, and following after other flesh, are set forth as an example, suffering the punishment of eternal fire.
065	JUD	001	008	Yet, these dreamers also in like manner defile the flesh, despise government, and speak evil of dignitaries.
065	JUD	001	009	But Michael the archangel, when, contending with the devil, he disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring a railing accusation, but said: The Lord rebuke you.
065	JUD	001	010	But these speak evil of the things which they know not: and those things which they know naturally, as animals without reason, in these they corrupt themselves.
065	JUD	001	011	Alas for them! for they have gone in the way of Cain: and, in the error of Balaam, they have rushed headlong after reward, and have perished in the rebellion of Korah.
065	JUD	001	012	These, while feasting with you, are spots in your lovefeasts, feeding themselves without fear; they are clouds without water, driven along by winds; trees of autumn, without fruit, twice dead, torn up by the roots:
065	JUD	001	013	raging waves of the sea, foaming up their own shame: wandering stars, for whom the blackness of darkness is reserved forever.
065	JUD	001	014	And Enoch, the seventh from Adam, also prophesied with reference to these men, saying: Behold, the Lord comes with his holy myriads,
065	JUD	001	015	to execute judgment upon all, and to convict all the ungodly of all their ungodly works, which they have impiously committed, and of all the hard words which ungodly sinners have spoken against him.
065	JUD	001	016	These are murmurers, fault-finders, walking according to their own desires; and their mouth speaks boastful words, while they admire persons for the sake of gain.
065	JUD	001	017	But do you, beloved, remember the words that were formerly spoken by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;
065	JUD	001	018	that they said to you, There should come, in the last days, scoffers walking according to their own ungodly desires.
065	JUD	001	019	These are they who separate themselves, animal, not having the Spirit.
065	JUD	001	020	But you, beloved, building yourselves up on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit,
065	JUD	001	021	keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ, in order to eternal life.
065	JUD	001	022	And on some, have compassion, making a distinction:
065	JUD	001	023	and others, save by fear, snatching them from the fire, hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.
065	JUD	001	024	Now to him that is able to keep you free from stumbling, and to present you blameless in the presence of his glory with exceeding joy,
065	JUD	001	025	to the only God our Savior, be glory and majesty, strength and authority, both now and throughout all the ages. Amen.

066	REV	001	001	The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him, that he might show to his servants the things that must shortly come to pass; and he sent it by his angel, and made it known to his servant John,
066	REV	001	002	who bore testimony to the word of God, and recorded the testimony of Jesus Christ, whatever things he saw.
066	REV	001	003	Blessed is he that reads, and those who hear the words of this prophecy, and keep the things that are written in it; for the time is at hand.
066	REV	001	004	John to the seven churches that are in Asia, grace be to you and peace from him who is, and who was, and who is to come; and from the seven spirits which are before his throne;
066	REV	001	005	and from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, the first-born from the dead, and the Prince of the kings of the earth. To him that loves us, and that has washed us from our sins in his own blood,
066	REV	001	006	and has made us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father; to him be glory and might from age to age. Amen.
066	REV	001	007	Behold, he comes with clouds, and every eye shall see him, and those also who pierced him: and all the tribes of the land shall lament because of him. Even so. Amen.
066	REV	001	008	I am the Alpha and the Omega, says the Lord God, who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty.
066	REV	001	009	I John, your brother and companion in the affliction, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the island called Patmos, on account of the word of God, and on account of the testimony of Jesus Christ.
066	REV	001	010	I was in spirit on the Lord’s day, and I heard behind me a great voice like that of a trumpet,
066	REV	001	011	saying: What you see, write in a book, and send to the seven churches; to Ephesus, and to Smyrna, and to Pergamos, and to Thyatira, and to Sardis, and to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.
066	REV	001	012	And I turned to see the voice that spoke with me: and having turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks,
066	REV	001	013	and in the midst of the seven candlesticks, one like the Son of man, clothed in a robe reaching to his feet, and girded about the breast with a golden girdle.
066	REV	001	014	His head and his hair were white as white wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire;
066	REV	001	015	and his feet were like fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace: and his voice was like the voice of many waters.
066	REV	001	016	And he had in his right hand seven stars; and out of his mouth went a sharp, two-edged sword: arid his face was as the sun when it shines in its strength.
066	REV	001	017	And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead; and he laid his right hand upon me, saying: Fear not, I am the First and the Last,
066	REV	001	018	and I am he that lives; and I was dead, and behold, I am alive from age to age: and I have the keys of hades and of death.
066	REV	001	019	Write, therefore, the things which you have seen, and the things which are, and those which shall be hereafter;
066	REV	001	020	the mystery of the seven stars which you saw in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches; and the seven candlesticks are the seven churches.
066	REV	002	001	To the angel of the church in Ephesus, write: These things says he that holds the seven stars in his right hand, that walks in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks;
066	REV	002	002	I know your works, and your labor, and your patience; and that you can not bear with those who are evil, and that you have tried those who say they are apostles, and are not, and have found them liars;
066	REV	002	003	and that you have patience, and have endured for my name’s sake, and have not fainted.
066	REV	002	004	But I have this against you, that you have left your first love.
066	REV	002	005	Remember, therefore, whence you have fallen, and repent, and do your first works; if not, I will come to you quickly, and I will remove your candlestick from its place, unless you repent.
066	REV	002	006	But you have this, that you hate the works of the Nicolaitanes, which I also hate.
066	REV	002	007	He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches: To him that overcomes, I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God.
066	REV	002	008	And to the angel of the church in Smyrna, write: These things says the First and the Last, who was dead, and is alive:
066	REV	002	009	I know your works, and your affliction, and your poverty, (but you are rich, ) and the impious words of those who say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.
066	REV	002	010	Fear none of the things which you are about to suffer; behold, the devil will throw some of you into prison, that you may be tried: and you shall have affliction ten days. Be faithful till death, and I will give you the crown of life.
066	REV	002	011	He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. He that overcomes shall not be hurt by the second death.
066	REV	002	012	And to the angel of the church in Pergamos, write: These things says he that has the sharp, two-edged sword;
066	REV	002	013	I know your works, and where you dwell, even where the throne of Satan is: and yet you hold fast my name, and have not denied my faith, even in those days in which Antipas was my faithful witness, who was slain among you, where Satan dwells.
066	REV	002	014	Yet I have a few things against you, that you have there those who hold the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to put a stumbling-block before the sons of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to practice lewdness.
066	REV	002	015	So, also, you have those who hold the teaching of the Nicolaitanes.
066	REV	002	016	Repent, therefore; if not, I will come to you quickly, and I will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.
066	REV	002	017	He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him that overcomes, I will give of the hidden manna; and I will give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name written, which no one knows but he that receives it.
066	REV	002	018	And to the angel of the church in Thyatira, write: These things, says the Son of God, who has his eyes like a flame of fire, and his feet like fine brass;
066	REV	002	019	I know your works, and your love, and your faith, and your service, and your patience, and your works, the last greater than the first.
066	REV	002	020	But I have against you that you suffer that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess, and teaches and deceives my servants to practice lewdness, and to eat things sacrificed to idols.
066	REV	002	021	And I have given her time to repent; and she will not repent of her lewdness.
066	REV	002	022	Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and those who commit adultery with her into great affliction, unless they repent of their deeds.
066	REV	002	023	And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he that searches the reins and the hearts: and I will give to every one of you according to your works.
066	REV	002	024	But I say to you, the rest who are in Thyatira, as many as have not this teaching, and who have not known the depths of Satan, (as they call them, ) I will lay on you no other burden:
066	REV	002	025	but what you have, hold fast till I come.
066	REV	002	026	And to him that overcomes, and keeps my works to the end, will I give authority over the nations;
066	REV	002	027	and he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken in pieces, as I have received from my Father:
066	REV	002	028	and I will give him the morning star.
066	REV	002	029	He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.
066	REV	003	001	And to the angel of the church in Sardis, write: These things says he that has the seven spirits of God, and the seven stars; I know your works, that you have a name, that you live, and are dead.
066	REV	003	002	Be watchful, and strengthen the things that remain, which are about to die; for I have not found your works perfect before God.
066	REV	003	003	Remember, therefore, how you have received and heard, and be watchful and repent. If, therefore, you do not watch, I will come upon you as a thief, and you shall not know at what hour I will come upon you.
066	REV	003	004	Yet you have a few names in Sardis that have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white, for they are worthy.
066	REV	003	005	He that overcomes, shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot his name out of the book of life: and I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels.
066	REV	003	006	He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.
066	REV	003	007	And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia, write: These things says he that is holy, he that is true, he that has the key of David, he that opens and no man shuts, and shuts and no man opens;
066	REV	003	008	I know your works: behold, I have set before you an open door that no one is able to shut, because you have a little strength, and have kept my word, and have not denied my name.
066	REV	003	009	Behold, I will make those who are of the synagogue of Satan, who say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them come and worship before your feet, and know that I have loved you.
066	REV	003	010	Because you have kept the word of my patience, I also will keep you from the hour of trial that is about to come on the whole world, to try those who dwell on the earth.
066	REV	003	011	I come quickly: hold fast that which you have, that no one take your crown.
066	REV	003	012	Him that overcomes, I will make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go out no more; and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven from my God, and I will write upon him my new name.
066	REV	003	013	He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.
066	REV	003	014	And to the angel of the church in Laodicea, write: These things says the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God;
066	REV	003	015	I know your works, that you are neither cold, nor hot: I wish that you were cold, or hot.
066	REV	003	016	So, then, because you are luke-warm, and neither cold, nor hot, I will vomit you out of my mouth.
066	REV	003	017	Because you say I am rich, and abound in wealth, and have need of nothing, and know not that you are miserable and pitiable and poor and blind and naked,
066	REV	003	018	I counsel you to buy of me gold that has been tried in the fire, that you may be rich; and white raiment, that you may be clothed, and that the shame of your nakedness may not appear; and anoint your eyes with eye-salve, that you may see.
066	REV	003	019	As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten; be zealous, therefore, and repent.
066	REV	003	020	Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if any one hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.
066	REV	003	021	To him that overcomes, I will give to sit with me in my throne, even as I also have overcome, and have taken my seat with my father in his throne.
066	REV	003	022	He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.
066	REV	004	001	After these things I saw, and behold, a door was opened in heaven; and the first voice which I heard, like the voice of a trumpet speaking with me, said: Come up hither, and I will show you things that must be hereafter.
066	REV	004	002	And immediately I was in spirit; and behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne;
066	REV	004	003	and he that sat was, in appearance, like a jasper and sardine-stone: and there was round about the throne a rainbow, in appearance like an emerald.
066	REV	004	004	And round about the throne were twenty-four thrones; and on the thrones there sat twenty-four elders, clothed in white raiment; and on their heads were crowns of gold.
066	REV	004	005	And out of the throne there went lightnings and thunderings and voices; and seven lamps of fire were burning before the throne: these are the seven spirits of God.
066	REV	004	006	And before the throne there was a sea of glass, like crystal. And in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, were four living creatures full of eyes before and behind.
066	REV	004	007	And the first living creature was like a lion, and the second living creature was like a calf, and the third living creature had the face of a man, and the fourth living creature was like a flying eagle.
066	REV	004	008	And the four living creatures had each of them six wings about him; and they are full of eyes within; and they have no rest day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God, the Almighty, who was, and is, and is to come.
066	REV	004	009	And when the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to him that sits on the throne, who lives from age to age,
066	REV	004	010	the twenty-four elders fall down before him that sits on the throne, and worship him that lives from age to age, and throw their crowns before the throne, saying:
066	REV	004	011	Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor and power: for thou hast created all things, and by thy will they exist, and were created.
066	REV	005	001	And I saw in the right hand of him that sits on the throne, a book written within and without, sealed with seven seals.
066	REV	005	002	And I saw a strong angel crying with a great voice: Who is worthy to open the book, and to break its seals?
066	REV	005	003	And no one in heaven, or on earth, or under the earth, was able to open the book, or to look upon it.
066	REV	005	004	And I wept much, because no one was found worthy to open the book, or to look upon it.
066	REV	005	005	And one of the elders said to me: Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, has the power to open the book and its seven seals.
066	REV	005	006	And I saw, in the midst of the throne, and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb standing, like one that had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God that are sent into all the earth.
066	REV	005	007	And he came, and took the book out of the right hand of him that sits on the throne.
066	REV	005	008	And when he had taken the book, the four living creatures, and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, having, each of them, harps, and golden cups full of incense, which is the prayers of the saints.
066	REV	005	009	And they sung a new song, saying: Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open its seals: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood, out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation:
066	REV	005	010	and hast made us to our God kings and priests, and we shall reign on the earth.
066	REV	005	011	And I saw, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the living creatures and the elders; and the number of them was myriads of myriads, and thousands of thousands.
066	REV	005	012	And they said, with a loud voice: Worthy is the Lamb that was slain, to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing.
066	REV	005	013	And every creature that is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are on the sea, even all that are in them, I heard saying: To him that sits on the throne, and to the Lamb, be blessing and honor and glory and strength from age to age.
066	REV	005	014	And the four living creatures said, Amen; and the elders fell down, and worshiped.
066	REV	006	001	And I saw when the Lamb opened the first of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures saying, with a voice like thunder, Come and see.
066	REV	006	002	And I saw, and behold, a white horse, and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given to him; and he went forth conquering, and to conquer.
066	REV	006	003	And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature say, Come and see.
066	REV	006	004	And there went forth another horse, which was red; and to him that sat on him was given to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another; and there was given to him a great sword.
066	REV	006	005	And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, Come and see. And I saw, and behold, a black horse; and he that sat on him had a pair of scales in his hand.
066	REV	006	006	And I heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures, saying: A chœnix of wheat for a denarius, and three chœnices of barley for a denarius; and as to the oil and the wine, see that you do no injustice.
066	REV	006	007	And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, Come and see.
066	REV	006	008	And I saw, and behold, a pale horse; and the name of him that sat upon him was Death: and Hades followed with him. And authority was given to him over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with the sword, and with famine, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth.
066	REV	006	009	And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they had borne:
066	REV	006	010	and they cried with a loud voice, saying: How long, O Sovereign, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?
066	REV	006	011	And a white robe was given to each of them: and it was said to them, that they should yet rest for a time, till the number of their fellow-servants, and of their brethren, who should be killed as they had been, should be completed.
066	REV	006	012	And I saw when he had opened the sixth seal; and there was a great earthquake, and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became like blood:
066	REV	006	013	and the stars of heaven fell to the earth, as a fig-tree casts its unripe figs when shaken by a violent wind:
066	REV	006	014	and the heaven departed as a volume when it is rolled up, and every mountain and island was moved out of its place:
066	REV	006	015	and the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the officers, and the rich men, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every freeman, hid themselves in the caves, and in the rocks of the mountains,
066	REV	006	016	and said to the mountains and to the rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sits on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb:
066	REV	006	017	for the great day of his wrath has come, and who is able to stand?
066	REV	007	001	And after this I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind might not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree.
066	REV	007	002	And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea,
066	REV	007	003	saying: Hurt not the earth, nor the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads.
066	REV	007	004	And I heard the number of those who were sealed: a hundred and forty-four thousand were sealed out of all the tribes of the sons of Israel.
066	REV	007	005	Of the tribe of Judah, twelve thousand were sealed: of the tribe of Reuben, twelve thousand were sealed: of the tribe of Gad, twelve thousand were sealed:
066	REV	007	006	of the tribe of Asher, twelve thousand were sealed: of the tribe of Naphtali, twelve thousand were sealed: of the tribe of Manasseh, twelve thousand were sealed:
066	REV	007	007	of the tribe of Simeon, twelve thousand were sealed: of the tribe of Levi, twelve thousand were sealed: of the tribe of Issachar, twelve thousand were sealed:
066	REV	007	008	of the tribe of Zabulon, twelve thousand were sealed: of the tribe of Joseph, twelve thousand were sealed: of the tribe of Benjamin, twelve thousand were sealed.
066	REV	007	009	After this I saw, and behold, a great multitude, that no one could number, out of all nations and tribes and peoples and tongues, standing before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and there were palms in their hands;
066	REV	007	010	and they cried with a loud voice, saying: Salvation to our God, who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb.
066	REV	007	011	And all the angels stood round about the throne and the elders and the four living creatures; and they fell on their faces before the throne, and worshiped God,
066	REV	007	012	saying, Amen: blessing and glory and wisdom and thanks and honor and power and strength be to our God from acre to acre. Amen.
066	REV	007	013	And one of the elders answered, and said to me: Who are these that are clothed in white robes, and whence came they?
066	REV	007	014	And I said to him: Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me: These are they who have come out of great affliction, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.
066	REV	007	015	Therefore, they are before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple; and he that sits on the throne shall dwell among them.
066	REV	007	016	They shall hunger no more, nor shall they thirst any more, nor shall the sun fall upon them, nor any heat.
066	REV	007	017	For the Lamb that is in the midst of the throne will be their shepherd, and will lead them to living fountains of water: and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.
066	REV	008	001	And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.
066	REV	008	002	And I saw the seven angels that stood before God, and seven trumpets were given to them.
066	REV	008	003	And another angel came, and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and much incense was given to him, that he might offer it with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar that is before the throne.
066	REV	008	004	And the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, ascended before God out of the hand of the angel.
066	REV	008	005	And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire from the altar, and threw it into the earth; and there were voices and thunderings and lightnings and an earthquake.
066	REV	008	006	And the seven angels that had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.
066	REV	008	007	And the first angel sounded; and there were hail and fire mingled with blood, and they were thrown into the earth: and the third part of the earth was burned up, and the third part of the trees was burned up, and all the green grass was burned up.
066	REV	008	008	And the second angel sounded; and, as it were, a great mountain, burning with fire, was thrown into the sea: and the third part of the sea became blood.
066	REV	008	009	And the third part of the creatures that were in the sea, that had life, died: and the third part of the ships was destroyed.
066	REV	008	010	And the third angel sounded; and there fell from heaven a great star, that burned as a lamp; and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters.
066	REV	008	011	And the name of the star is called Wormwood; and the third part of the waters became wormwood: and many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter.
066	REV	008	012	And the fourth angel sounded; and the third part of the sun, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars was smitten, that the third part might be darkened, and that the day might not shine for the third part of it, and the night in like manner.
066	REV	008	013	And I saw, and heard an eagle, as he flew in mid-heaven, saying, with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe to the inhabitants of the earth, because of the remaining voices of the trumpets of the three angels which are yet to sound.
066	REV	009	001	And the fifth angel sounded; and I saw a star fall from heaven to the earth; and there was given to him the key of the pit of the abyss;
066	REV	009	002	and he opened the pit of the abyss; and there arose a smoke out of the pit, like the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by the smoke of the pit.
066	REV	009	003	And out of the smoke there came locusts upon the earth; and power was given to them, as the scorpions of the earth have power.
066	REV	009	004	And they were commanded not to hurt the grass of the earth, nor any green thing, nor any tree, but the men who have not the seal of God in their foreheads.
066	REV	009	005	And they were permitted, not to kill them, but to torment them five months; and the torment inflicted by them was like the torment inflicted by a scorpion, when he stings a man.
066	REV	009	006	And in those days men will seek for death, and shall not find it; and they will desire to die, and death shall flee from them.
066	REV	009	007	And the shapes of the locusts were like horses prepared for battle; and on their heads were, as it were, crowns of gold; and their faces were like the faces of men.
066	REV	009	008	And they had hair like the hair of women; and their teeth were like the teeth of lions.
066	REV	009	009	And they had breastplates like breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings was like the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle.
066	REV	009	010	And they had tails like scorpions, and there were stings in their tails; and they had power to hurt men five months.
066	REV	009	011	And they had over them a king, the angel of the abyss: his name, in Hebrew, is Abaddon, and, in Greek, he has the name Apollyon.
066	REV	009	012	The first woe is past: behold, there are coming, after this, two woes more.
066	REV	009	013	And the sixth angel sounded: and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar that is before God,
066	REV	009	014	saying to the sixth angel, who had the trumpet: Loose the four angels that are bound at the great river Euphrates.
066	REV	009	015	And the four angels were loosed, who were prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year, to slay the third part of men.
066	REV	009	016	And the number of the armies of horsemen was two myriads of myriads: I heard the number of them.
066	REV	009	017	And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and those who sat on them; they had breastplates, fiery, and hyacinthine, and sulphurous: and the heads of the horses were like the heads of lions, and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone.
066	REV	009	018	By these three plagues was the third part of men killed, by the fire, and the smoke, and the brimstone that issued out of their mouths.
066	REV	009	019	For their power was in their mouth and in their tails; for their tails were like serpents, and had heads, and with them they do injury.
066	REV	009	020	And the rest of men that were not killed by these plagues, repented not of the works of their hands, that they might not worship demons, and idols of gold, and of silver, and of brass, and of stone, and of wood, which can neither see, nor hear, nor walk;
066	REV	009	021	and they repented not of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their lewdness, nor of their thefts.
066	REV	010	001	And I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven, clothed with a cloud; and the rainbow was upon his head, and his face was like the sun, and his feet like pillars of fire.
066	REV	010	002	And he had in his hand a little book opened; and he placed his right foot on the sea, and his left foot on the land;
066	REV	010	003	and he cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roars: and when he had cried, the seven thunders uttered their voices.
066	REV	010	004	And when the seven thunders had spoken, I was about to write; and I heard a voice from heaven, saying: Seal up the things which the seven thunders spoke, and write them not.
066	REV	010	005	And the angel that I saw standing on the sea and on the land, lifted up his right hand to heaven,
066	REV	010	006	and swore by him that lives from age to age, who created the heaven and the things that are in it, and the earth and the things that are in it, and the sea and the things that are in it, That time should no longer intervene,
066	REV	010	007	but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall sound his trumpet, the mystery of God should be finished, as he has declared to his servants the prophets.
066	REV	010	008	And the voice that I heard from heaven spoke to me again, and said: Go and take the little book that is open in the hand of the angel that stands on the sea and on the land.
066	REV	010	009	And I went to the angel, and said to him: Give me the little book. And he said to me: Take it, and eat it up, and it will make your stomach bitter, but it will be in your mouth as sweet as honey.
066	REV	010	010	And I took the little book out of the angel’s hand, and ate it up, and it was in my mouth as sweet as honey; and when I had eaten it, my stomach was bitter.
066	REV	010	011	And he said to me: You must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings.
066	REV	011	001	And a reed like a rod was given to me; and it was said: Rise and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and those who worship in it.
066	REV	011	002	But the court that is without the temple leave out, and measure it not: for it is given to the Gentiles, and the holy city they shall tread under foot forty-two months.
066	REV	011	003	And I will give to my two witnesses, that they may prophesy a thousand two hundred and sixty days, clothed in sackcloth.
066	REV	011	004	These are the two olive trees, and the two lamps that stand before the Lord of the earth.
066	REV	011	005	And if any man will injure them, fire proceeds out of their mouth, and devours their enemies; and if any one will injure them, he must be killed in this way.
066	REV	011	006	These have authority to shut heaven, that it may not rain in the days of their prophecy; and they have authority over the waters, to turn them to blood, and to smite the earth with every plague, as often as they wish.
066	REV	011	007	And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that ascends out of the abyss will make war with them, and overcome them, and kill them.
066	REV	011	008	And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city, which, spiritually, is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified.
066	REV	011	009	And some of the peoples and tribes and tongues and nations will see their dead bodies three days and a half, and will not suffer their dead bodies to be put into sepulchers.
066	REV	011	010	And those who dwell on the earth will rejoice over them, and make merry, and will send gifts to one another, because these two prophets tormented those who dwelt on the earth.
066	REV	011	011	And after the three days and a half, the spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon those who saw them.
066	REV	011	012	And they heard a great voice from heaven, saying to them: Come up hither. And they went up into heaven in a cloud, and their enemies beheld them.
066	REV	011	013	And in that hour there was a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell; and in the earthquake there were slain names of men, seven thousand: and the rest were frightened, and gave glory to the God of heaven.
066	REV	011	014	The second woe is past: behold, the third woe comes quickly.
066	REV	011	015	And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying: The kingdom of the world has become our Lord’s and his Christ’s, and he shall reign from age to age.
066	REV	011	016	And the twenty-four elders that sat before God on their thrones, fell upon their faces, and worshiped God,
066	REV	011	017	saying: We give thee thanks, O Lord God Almighty, who art, and who wast, because thou hast taken thy great power, and hast reigned.
066	REV	011	018	And the nations were angry, and thy wrath has come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that thou shouldst give reward to thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and to those who fear thy name, both small and great, and that thou shouldst destroy those who corrupt the earth.
066	REV	011	019	And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in his temple, the ark of the covenant of the Lord; and there were lightnings and voices and thunderings, and an earthquake, and great hail.
066	REV	012	001	And a great sign appeared in heaven, a woman clothed with the sun; and the moon was under her feet, and on her head was a crown of twelve stars;
066	REV	012	002	and, being with child, she cried out in travail, and in the pains of delivery.
066	REV	012	003	And there appeared another sign in heaven; and behold, a great dragon, fiery-red, that had seven heads, and ten horns: and on his heads seven diadems.
066	REV	012	004	And his tail drew along the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to bring forth, that, when she had brought forth, he might devour her child.
066	REV	012	005	And she brought forth a male child, that was to rule all nations with a rod of iron; and her child was caught away to God, even to his throne.
066	REV	012	006	And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared by God, that they should feed her there for a thousand two hundred and sixty days.
066	REV	012	007	And there was war in heaven; Michael and his angels fought with the dragon; and the dragon and his angels fought,
066	REV	012	008	and prevailed not: nor was their place found any more in heaven.
066	REV	012	009	And the great dragon, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, who deceives the whole world, was cast into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.
066	REV	012	010	And I heard a great voice in heaven, saying: Now has come the salvation, and the power, and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren, he that accused them before our God day and night, is cast down.
066	REV	012	011	And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives even to death.
066	REV	012	012	Therefore, rejoice you heavens, and you that dwell in them. Alas for the land and for the sea! for the devil has come down to you with great anger, because he knows that he has but a short time.
066	REV	012	013	And when the dragon saw that he was cast into the earth, he persecuted the woman that brought forth the male child.
066	REV	012	014	And two wings of a great eagle were given to the woman, that she might fly into the wilderness into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, away from the presence of the serpent.
066	REV	012	015	And the serpent threw out of his mouth water like a river, after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away by the river.
066	REV	012	016	And the earth helped the woman; and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed up the river that the dragon threw out of his mouth.
066	REV	012	017	And the dragon was angry with the woman, and went away to make war with the rest of her children, that keep the commandments of God, and that hold the testimony of Jesus.
066	REV	013	001	And I stood on the sand of the sea, and saw a beast coming up out of the sea, and he had seven heads and ten horns, and on his horns ten diadems, and on his heads names impiously irreverent.
066	REV	013	002	And the beast that I saw was like a leopard, and his feet were as those of a bear, and his mouth was as the mouth of a lion. And the dragon gave him his power, and his throne, and great authority.
066	REV	013	003	And I saw one of his heads as if it had been wounded even to death; and his deadly wound was healed; and all the earth wondered after the beast.
066	REV	013	004	And they worshiped the dragon, because he gave authority to the beast: and they worshiped the beast, saying, Who is like the beast? and, Who is able to make war with him?
066	REV	013	005	And there was given him a mouth that spoke great things and impious words; and authority was given to him to continue forty-two months.
066	REV	013	006	And he opened his mouth in impious speeches against God, to utter impious words against his name, and his tabernacle, and against those who dwell in heaven.
066	REV	013	007	And it was given him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and authority was given him over every tribe and people and tongue and nation.
066	REV	013	008	And all that dwell upon the earth will worship him, those whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb that was slain from the foundation of the world.
066	REV	013	009	If any one has an ear, let him hear.
066	REV	013	010	If any one leads into captivity, he shall go into captivity. If any kills with the sword, he must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and faithfulness of the saints.
066	REV	013	011	And I saw another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spoke as a dragon.
066	REV	013	012	And he exercises all the authority of the first beast in his presence; and he causes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.
066	REV	013	013	And he does great signs, and even causes fire to descend from heaven upon the earth in the sight of men.
066	REV	013	014	And he deceives those who dwell on the earth, by means of the signs which he is allowed to do in the presence of the beast, saying to those who dwell on the earth, that they should make an image for the beast which had the wound by the sword, and did live.
066	REV	013	015	And it was granted him to give spirit to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause as many as would not worship the image of the beast, to be killed.
066	REV	013	016	And he causes all, small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark on their right hand, or on their forehead,
066	REV	013	017	and that no one should be able to buy or sell, but he that had the mark, the name of the beast, or the number of his name.
066	REV	013	018	Here is wisdom. Let him that has understanding, count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man, and his number is six hundred and sixty-six.
066	REV	014	001	And I saw, and behold, the Lamb stood on the mount Zion, and with him a hundred and forty-four thousand, that had his name and his Father’s name written in their foreheads.
066	REV	014	002	And I heard a voice from heaven like the voice of many waters, and like the voice of loud thunder; and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps.
066	REV	014	003	And they sung a new song before the throne, and before the four living creatures, and the elders: and no one was able to learn the song, but the hundred and forty-four thousand that had been redeemed from the earth.
066	REV	014	004	These are they that were not defiled with women; for they are virgins; these are they that follow the Lamb wherever he goes: these were redeemed from among men, the first-fruits to God and to the Lamb.
066	REV	014	005	And in their mouth was found no guile; for they are blameless.
066	REV	014	006	And I saw another angel flying in mid-heaven, having the eternal gospel to preach to those who dwell on the earth, even to every nation and tribe and tongue and people;
066	REV	014	007	and he said with a loud voice: Fear God, and give glory to him, for the hour of his judgment has come; and worship him that made the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.
066	REV	014	008	And another angel followed, saying: Babylon the great has fallen, has fallen; because she has made all nations drink of the maddening wine of her lewdness.
066	REV	014	009	And the third angel followed them, saying, with a loud voice: If any one worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or on his hand, even he shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is prepared without mixture in the cup of his indignation;
066	REV	014	010	and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:
066	REV	014	011	and the smoke of their torment ascends from age to age: and they who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name, have no rest day or night.
066	REV	014	012	Here is the patience of the saints, who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.
066	REV	014	013	And I heard a voice from heaven, saying: Write, Blessed are the dead that die in the Lord from this time. Yes, says the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors, and their works do follow them.
066	REV	014	014	And I saw, and behold, a white cloud, and on the cloud sat one like the Son of man, who had on his head a crown of gold, and in his hand a sharp sickle.
066	REV	014	015	And another angel came out of the temple, and cried with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud: Thrust in your sickle and reap, for the time has come for you to reap, for the harvest of the earth is fully ripe.
066	REV	014	016	And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth, and the earth was reaped.
066	REV	014	017	And another angel came out of the temple that is in heaven, and he also had a sharp sickle.
066	REV	014	018	And another angel that had power over fire, came out from the altar; and he cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle, and said: Thrust in your sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, for its grapes are fully ripe.
066	REV	014	019	And the angel thrust in his sickle on the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and threw it into the great wine-press of the wrath of God.
066	REV	014	020	And the wine-press was trodden without the city; and blood came out of the wine-press, even to the bridles of the horses, to the distance of a thousand and six hundred furlongs.
066	REV	015	001	And I saw another sign in heaven, great and wonderful: seven angels that had seven plagues which are the last; for by them the wrath of God is brought to an end.
066	REV	015	002	And I saw, as it were, a sea of glass mingled with fire, and those who had obtained the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over the number of his name, standing on the sea of glass, having the harps of God.
066	REV	015	003	And they sung the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying: Great and wonderful are thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are thy ways, thou King of saints.
066	REV	015	004	Who will not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? For thou alone art holy; for all nations shall come and worship before thee: because thy judgments are made manifest.
066	REV	015	005	And after this I saw, and the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened;
066	REV	015	006	and the seven angels that had the seven plagues came out of the temple, clothed in pure white linen, and girded about the breasts with golden girdles.
066	REV	015	007	And one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden cups full of the wrath of God, who lives from age to age.
066	REV	015	008	And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power; and no one was able to enter the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels were completed.
066	REV	016	001	And I heard a great voice out of the temple, saying to the seven angels: Go and pour out the seven cups of the wrath of God upon the earth.
066	REV	016	002	And the first angel went, and poured out his cup on the land; and there came a hurtful and afflictive sore upon the men that had the mark of the beast, and that worshiped his image.
066	REV	016	003	And the second angel poured out his cup on the sea; and it became blood, like that of a dead man: and every soul in the sea died.
066	REV	016	004	And the third angel poured out his cup on the rivers and the fountains of waters; and they became blood.
066	REV	016	005	And I heard the angel of the waters, saying: Just art thou, who art and who wast, the Holy One, because thou hast thus judged.
066	REV	016	006	For they have shed the blood of saints and of prophets, and thou hast given them blood to drink, and they are worthy.
066	REV	016	007	And I heard a voice from the altar saying: Even so; Lord God Almighty, true and just are thy judgments.
066	REV	016	008	And the fourth angel poured out his cup on the sun; and it was given to him to scorch men with fire.
066	REV	016	009	And men were scorched with great heat; and they uttered impious words against the name of God who has power over these plagues; and they repented not, that they might give him glory.
066	REV	016	010	And the fifth angel poured out his cup on the throne of the beast; and his kingdom was filled with darkness; and they gnawed their tongues because of pain;
066	REV	016	011	and they spoke impiously against the God of heaven because of their pains, and because of their sores; and they repented not of their works.
066	REV	016	012	And the sixth angel poured out his cup on the great river Euphrates; and its water was dried up, that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared.
066	REV	016	013	And I saw three unclean spirits, like frogs, come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet.
066	REV	016	014	For they are the spirits of demons that do signs, and they go forth to the kings of the whole world, to bring them together to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.
066	REV	016	015	Behold, I come as a thief: blessed is he that watches, and keeps his garments, that he may not walk naked, and that men may not see his nakedness.
066	REV	016	016	And they brought them together into a place that is called, in the Hebrew tongue, Armageddon.
066	REV	016	017	And the seventh angel poured out his cup into the air; and there came a great voice from the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying: It is done.
066	REV	016	018	And there were lightnings and voices and thunders; and there was a great earthquake, such as has not been since men were on the earth, ―so great an earthquake, and so mighty.
066	REV	016	019	And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and Babylon the great was remembered before God, that he might give her the cup of the wine of his fiercest wrath.
066	REV	016	020	And every island fled, and the mountains were not found.
066	REV	016	021	And great hail, every stone about the weight of a talent, fell from heaven upon men; and men spoke impiously against God, because of the plague of the hail: for the plague of it was very great.
066	REV	017	001	And there came one of the seven angels that had the seven cups, and talked with me, saying: Come, I will show you the judgment of the great harlot that sits on many waters,
066	REV	017	002	with whom the kings of the earth have practiced lewdness, and with the wine of whose lewdness the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk.
066	REV	017	003	And he carried me away in spirit into the wilderness; and I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast, that was full of impious names, and that had seven heads and ten horns.
066	REV	017	004	And the woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold, and precious stones, and pearls; and she had in her hand a golden cup full of idolatrous pollutions, and the impurities of her lewdness.
066	REV	017	005	And on her forehead was a name written: MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS, AND OF THE IDOLATROUS POLLUTIONS OF THE EARTH.
066	REV	017	006	And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus; and when I saw her, I wondered with great astonishment.
066	REV	017	007	And the angel said to me: Why did you wonder? I will tell you the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carries her, that has seven heads and ten horns.
066	REV	017	008	The beast that you saw, was, and is not, and will come out of the abyss, and go to perdition; and those who dwell on the earth, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, will wonder, when they see the beast that was, and is not, though he is yet present.
066	REV	017	009	Here is the mind that has wisdom: the seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sits.
066	REV	017	010	And there are seven kings: five have fallen, one is, and the other has not yet come; and when he comes, he must remain but a little while.
066	REV	017	011	And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goes to perdition.
066	REV	017	012	And the ten horns which you saw are ten kings, who have received no kingdom as yet, but receive authority as kings at the same time with the beast.
066	REV	017	013	These have one mind, and will give their power and authority to the beast.
066	REV	017	014	These will make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb will overcome them, for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and those with him are called and chosen and faithful.
066	REV	017	015	And he said to me: The waters which you saw, where the harlot sits, are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues.
066	REV	017	016	And the ten horns that you saw, and the beast, these will hate the harlot, and will make her desolate and naked, and will eat her flesh, and burn her up with fire.
066	REV	017	017	For God has put into their hearts to fulfill his will, and to agree, and to give their kingdom to the beast, till the words of God be accomplished.
066	REV	017	018	And the woman that you saw is that great city, which reigns over the kings of the earth.
066	REV	018	001	And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lighted with his glory.
066	REV	018	002	And he cried with a strong voice, saying: Babylon the great has fallen, has fallen, and has become the habitation of demons, and the haunt of every unclean spirit, and the resort of every unclean and hateful bird.
066	REV	018	003	For she has made all nations drink of the maddening wine of her lewdness; and the kings of the earth have practiced lewdness with her, and the merchants of the earth have become rich by the power of her voluptuousness.
066	REV	018	004	And I heard another voice from heaven, saying: Come out of her, my people, lest you become partakers of her sins, and lest you receive of her plagues.
066	REV	018	005	For her sins reach even to heaven, and God has remembered her iniquities.
066	REV	018	006	Reward her as she has rewarded you, and render back to her double, according to her works: in the cup that she has mixed, mix for her double.
066	REV	018	007	As much glory and voluptuousness as she has given to herself, so much torment and sorrow give her: for she says in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow.
066	REV	018	008	Therefore, her plagues shall come in one day, death and mourning and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire: for strong is the Lord God who judges her.
066	REV	018	009	And the kings of the earth, who have practiced lewdness and lived voluptuously with her, shall weep and lament for her, when they see the smoke of her burning,
066	REV	018	010	standing far off for fear of her torment, saying: Alas, alas, that great city of Babylon, that mighty city! for in one hour has your judgment come.
066	REV	018	011	And the merchants of the earth shall weep and lament over her, because no one buys their merchandise any more;
066	REV	018	012	the merchandise of gold and silver and precious stones, and of pearls, and of fine linen and purple, and of silk and scarlet; and every kind of thyme wood, and every kind of vessel of ivory, and every kind of vessel of most costly wood, and of brass, and of iron, and of marble:
066	REV	018	013	and cinnamon and amomum and incense, and ointment and frankincense, and wine and oil, and fine flour and wheat, and beasts and sheep, and horses and chariots, and bodies and souls of men.
066	REV	018	014	And the fruits that your soul desired have departed from you; and all things that are dainty and sumptuous have perished from you, and you shall find them no more at all.
066	REV	018	015	Those who traded in these things, who were made rich by her, Shalt stand far off for fear of her torment, weeping and mourning and
066	REV	018	016	saying: Alas, alas, that great city, that was clothed in fine linen and purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls! for in one hour, so great riches have been brought to ruin.
066	REV	018	017	And every master of a ship, and every one in ships, and sailors, and as many as trade by sea, stood far off,
066	REV	018	018	and cried, when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying: What city is like the great city?
066	REV	018	019	And they threw dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and mourning and saying: Alas, alas, that great city, by which all that had ships in the sea became rich by means of costly merchandise! for in one hour she is made desolate.
066	REV	018	020	Rejoice over her, O heaven, and you saints and apostles and prophets: for God has avenged you on her.
066	REV	018	021	And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and threw it into the sea, saying: Thus, with violence shall Babylon, that great city, be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all.
066	REV	018	022	And the voice of harpers and musicians, and of pipers and trumpeters, shall be heard no more at all in you: and no artist of any art whatever, shall be found any more in you: and the sound of the millstone shall be heard no more in you:
066	REV	018	023	and the light of a lamp shall shine no more in you: and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more in you: for your merchants were the great men of the earth: for by your sorcery were all nations deceived.
066	REV	018	024	And in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints, and of all that were slain upon the earth.
066	REV	019	001	After these things, I heard the great voice of a vast multitude in heaven, saying: Alleluia; Salvation and glory and honor and power to our God:
066	REV	019	002	for true and righteous are his judgments, for he has judged the great harlot that corrupted the earth with her lewdness; and he has avenged the blood of his servants at her hand.
066	REV	019	003	And again they said: Alleluia; and her smoke rises up from age to age.
066	REV	019	004	And the twenty-four elders, and the four living creatures, fell down, and worshiped God that sits upon the throne, saying: Amen, Alleluia.
066	REV	019	005	And a voice came out of the throne, saying: Praise our God all you his servants, and you that fear him, both small and great.
066	REV	019	006	And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying: Alleluia; for the Lord God the Almighty reigns.
066	REV	019	007	Let us rejoice and be glad, and give glory to him: for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and his wife has made herself ready.
066	REV	019	008	And to her was given that she should be clothed in fine linen, clean arid white; for the fine linen is the righteousness of the saints.
066	REV	019	009	And he said to me: Write, Blessed are they that are called to the marriage-supper of the Lamb. And he said to me: These are the true words of God.
066	REV	019	010	And I fell at his feet to worship him; and he said to me: See that you do it not; I am your fellow-servant, and of your brethren that have the testimony of Jesus; worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.
066	REV	019	011	And I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse, and he that sat on him was called faithful and true, and in righteousness does he judge, and make war.
066	REV	019	012	His eyes were like a flame of fire, and on his head were many diadems; and he had a name written which no one knew, but he himself.
066	REV	019	013	And he was clothed with a garment dipped in blood; and his name is called The Word of God.
066	REV	019	014	And the armies that were in heaven followed him on white horses; and they were clothed in fine linen, white and clean.
066	REV	019	015	And out of his mouth goes a sharp, two-edged sword, that with it he may smite the nations; and he shall rule them with a rod of iron; and he treads the wine-press of the fiercest wrath of God, the Almighty.
066	REV	019	016	And he has, on his raiment and on his thigh, a name written, King of kings, and Lord of lords.
066	REV	019	017	And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the birds that fly in mid-heaven. Come, gather yourselves to the great supper of God,
066	REV	019	018	that you may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of officers, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of those who sit on them, and the flesh of all, both freemen and servants, both small and great.
066	REV	019	019	And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, assembled together to make war with him that sat on the horse, and with his army.
066	REV	019	020	And the beast was taken, and the false prophet that was with him, who did signs in his presence, with which he deceived those who received the mark of the beast, and those who worshiped his image. These two were thrown alive into the lake of fire, which burns with brimstone.
066	REV	019	021	And the rest were slain with the sword of him that sat on the horse, which sword proceeded out of his mouth: and all the birds were filled with their flesh.
066	REV	020	001	And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the abyss, and a great chain in his hand.
066	REV	020	002	And he laid hold of the dragon, that old serpent, which is the devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years,
066	REV	020	003	and threw him into the abyss, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be completed: and after this he must be loosed for a little while.
066	REV	020	004	And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and the power of judging was given to them; and I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for the testimony of Jesus, and for the word of God; and of those who had not worshiped the beast, nor his image, and had not received his mark on their forehead, nor on their hand: and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.
066	REV	020	005	But the rest of the dead lived not till the thousand years were completed. This is the first resurrection.
066	REV	020	006	Blessed and holy is he that has part in the first resurrection; over such the second death has no power: but they shall be priests of God and of the Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.
066	REV	020	007	And when the thousand years shall have been completed, Satan shall be loosed from his prison,
066	REV	020	008	and shall go out to deceive the nations that are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to bring them together to battle: the number of these is as the sand of the sea.
066	REV	020	009	And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and encompassed the camp of the saints, and the beloved city: and fire came down out of heaven from God, and devoured them.
066	REV	020	010	And the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are: and they shall be tormented day and night from age to age.
066	REV	020	011	And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat upon it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and no place was found for them.
066	REV	020	012	And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before the throne; and the books were opened; and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of the things that were written in the books, according to their works.
066	REV	020	013	And the sea gave up the dead that were in it; and death and hades gave up the dead that were in them; and they were judged, every one according to his works.

066	REV	021	004	And he will wipe every tear from their eyes, and there shall be no more death; neither shall there be any more sorrow, nor crying, nor pain; for the former things have passed away.
066	REV	021	005	And he that sat upon the throne said: Behold, I make all things new. And he said to me: Write, for these words are true and faithful.
066	REV	021	006	And he said to me: It is done; I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. To him that thirsts, I will give of the fountain of the water of life freely.
066	REV	021	007	He that overcomes, shall inherit these things, and I will be his God, and he shall be my son.
066	REV	021	008	But the fearful, and the unbelieving, and the detestable, and murderers and lewd persons and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars, shall have their part in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.
066	REV	021	009	And there came one of the seven angels that had the seven cups full of the seven last plagues; and he talked with me, saying: Come hither, and I will show you the bride, the Lamb’s wife.
066	REV	021	010	And he carried me away in spirit to a mountain, great and high, and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God,
066	REV	021	011	having the glory of God: that which gave it light was like a most costly stone, like jasper-stone, brilliant as crystal.
066	REV	021	012	It had a wall, great and high; and it had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written on them, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel;

066	REV	021	014	And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them were the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
066	REV	021	015	And he that talked with me had a measure, a golden reed, that he might measure the city, and its gates, and its wall.
066	REV	021	016	And the city lies square: and its length is as great as its breadth. And he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs: the length, and the breadth, and the hight of it are equal.
066	REV	021	017	And he measured the wall of it, a hundred and forty-four cubits, the measure of a man, that is, of an angel.
066	REV	021	018	And the wall of it was built of jasper; and the city was pure gold, like clear glass.
066	REV	021	019	And the foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with every costly stone: the first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald;

066	REV	021	022	And I saw no temple in it: for the Lord God the Almighty, and the Lamb, are its temple.
066	REV	021	023	And the city had no need of the sun, nor of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God gave it light, and the lamp of it is the Lamb.
066	REV	021	024	And the nations shall walk by the light of it; and the kings of the earth bring their glory and their honor into it.
066	REV	021	025	And its gates shall not be shut at all by day: for there shall be no night there.
066	REV	021	026	And they shall bring the glory and honor of the nations into it.
066	REV	021	027	And there shall not enter it any thing unclean, or that does what is detestable, or that makes a lie: but those who are written in the Lamb’s book of life.
066	REV	022	001	And he showed me a river of water of life, clear as crystal, coming out from the throne of God and of the Lamb.
066	REV	022	002	In the midst of the street of the city, and on each side of the river, was the tree of life, which bore twelve kinds of fruit, and yielded its fruit every month; and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.
066	REV	022	003	And there shall be no more curse; and the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it: and his servants shall serve him.
066	REV	022	004	And they shall see his face, and his name shall be in their foreheads.
066	REV	022	005	And there shall be no more night; and they have no need of the lamp, nor of the light of the sun: for the Lord God will give them light: and they shall reign from age to age.
066	REV	022	006	And he said to me: These words are faithful and true; and the Lord God of the spirits of the prophets has sent his angel to show his servants the things that must shortly take place.
066	REV	022	007	And behold, I come quickly: blessed is he that keeps the words of the prophecy of this book.
066	REV	022	008	And I, John, am he that saw and heard these things. And when I had heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel that showed me these things.
066	REV	022	009	And he said to me: See that you do it not; I am your fellow-servant, and of your brethren the prophets, and of those who keep the words of this book: worship God.
066	REV	022	010	And he said to me: Seal not the words of the prophecy of this book: for the time is at hand.
066	REV	022	011	He that is unjust, let him be unjust still; he that is polluted, let him be polluted still; and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still; and he that is holy, let him be holy still.
066	REV	022	012	Behold, I come quickly, and my reward is with me, to give to every one as his work shall be.

066	REV	022	016	I, Jesus, have sent my angel to testify these things to you for the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, the bright, morning star.
066	REV	022	017	And the Spirit and the bride say, Come; and let him that hears, say, Come; and let him that is thirsty, come; and let him that is willing, take the water of life freely.
066	REV	022	018	I testify to every one that hears the words of the prophecy of this book: if any one add to these things, God will add to him the plagues that are written in this book.
066	REV	022	019	And if any one take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his part from the tree of life, and from the holy city; which things are written in this book.
066	REV	022	020	He that testifies these things, says: Surely, I come quickly. Amen: come, Lord Jesus.
066	REV	022	021	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with all the saints.
