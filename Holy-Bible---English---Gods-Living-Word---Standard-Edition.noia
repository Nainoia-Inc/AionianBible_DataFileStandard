# BOOK	043	JOH	John	John
043	JOH	001	001	In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
043	JOH	001	002	He was in the beginning with God.
043	JOH	001	003	Everything was made through Him, and without Him nothing was made that was made.
043	JOH	001	004	In Him was life, and that life was the light of mankind.
043	JOH	001	005	The light shines in the darkness, but the darkness hasn’t overcome it.
043	JOH	001	006	There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.
043	JOH	001	007	This man came as a witness, to testify about the light, that all through him might believe.
043	JOH	001	008	He wasn’t that light, but was sent as a witness of that light.
043	JOH	001	009	The true light that enlightens everyone was coming into the world.
043	JOH	001	010	The Word was in the world, and though the world was made through Him, the world didn’t recognize Him.
043	JOH	001	011	He came to His own, and those who were His own didn’t receive Him.
043	JOH	001	012	But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become God’s children, to those who believe in His name:
043	JOH	001	013	who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.
043	JOH	001	014	The Word became flesh and lived among us, and we saw His glory, the glory as of the only Son of the Father, full of grace and truth.
043	JOH	001	015	John testified about Him. He cried out, saying, “This was He who I told you about when I said, ‘He who comes after me has surpassed me because He was before me.’”
043	JOH	001	016	From His fullness we have all received grace upon grace.
043	JOH	001	017	The Law was given through Moses, but grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.
043	JOH	001	018	No one has ever seen God, but God’s only born Son, who is near to the heart of His Father, has made Him known.
043	JOH	001	019	Now this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, “Who are you?”
043	JOH	001	020	He confessed, and didn’t deny, but confessed, “I’m not the Christ.”
043	JOH	001	021	They asked him, “Then who are you? Are you Elijah?” He said, “I am not.” “Are you the Prophet?” He answered, “No.”
043	JOH	001	022	Then they asked him, “Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?”
043	JOH	001	023	John replied in the words of Isaiah the prophet, “I am the voice of one calling in the desert, ‘Make straight the way for the Lord.’”
043	JOH	001	024	Now those who were sent were Pharisees.
043	JOH	001	025	They asked him, saying, “Why then do you baptize if you aren’t the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?”
043	JOH	001	026	John answered them, saying, “I baptize with water, but One stands among you that you don’t know.
043	JOH	001	027	It is He who, coming after me, is preferred before me, whose sandal strap I’m not worthy to untie.”
043	JOH	001	028	This all happened at Bethany on the other side of the Jordan, where John was baptizing.
043	JOH	001	029	The next day, John saw Jesus coming toward him, and said, “Look! God’s Lamb who takes away the sin of the world!
043	JOH	001	030	This is the One I meant when I said, ‘A man who comes after me is preferred before me because He existed before me.’
043	JOH	001	031	I didn’t know Him, but the reason I came baptizing with water was that He might be revealed to Israel.”
043	JOH	001	032	John testified, saying, “I saw the Spirit descending from Heaven like a dove, and He remained upon Him.
043	JOH	001	033	I wouldn’t have known Him, but He who sent me to baptize with water told me, ‘Whoever you see the Spirit descending upon, and remaining on Him, this is He who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.’
043	JOH	001	034	I have seen and I testify that this is God’s Son.”
043	JOH	001	035	The next day, John again stood with two of His disciples.
043	JOH	001	036	When he saw Jesus passing by, he said, “Look, God’s Lamb!”
043	JOH	001	037	The two disciples heard him say this, and they followed Jesus.
043	JOH	001	038	Jesus turned, and seeing them following, asked them, “What are you looking for?” They said to Him, “Rabbi” (which, when translated, means Teacher), “Where are You staying?”
043	JOH	001	039	He told them, “Come and see.” They came and saw where He was staying, and spent that day with Him. It was about the tenth hour.
043	JOH	001	040	Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, was one of the two who heard what John had said and who had followed Jesus.
043	JOH	001	041	The first thing Andrew did was to find his brother, Simon, and tell him, “We have found the Messiah” (that is, translated, the Christ).
043	JOH	001	042	Andrew brought Simon to Jesus. Jesus looked at him, and said, “You are Simon the son of Jonah. You will be called Cephas” (which is translated Peter).
043	JOH	001	043	The next day Jesus decided to leave for Galilee. Finding Philip, he told him, “Follow me.”
043	JOH	001	044	Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.
043	JOH	001	045	Philip found Nathanael and told him, “We have found Him who Moses in the Law, and also the prophets, wrote about — Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.”
043	JOH	001	046	Nathanael asked Philip, “Can anything good come out of Nazareth?” Philip told Nathanael, “Come and see.”
043	JOH	001	047	Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward Him, and said of Nathanael, “Look! An Israelite indeed, who has no deceit in him!”
043	JOH	001	048	Nathanael asked Him, “How do You know me?” Jesus answered, “Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.”
043	JOH	001	049	Nathanael answered, “Rabbi, You are God’s Son. You are the King of Israel.”
043	JOH	001	050	Jesus said to him, “Because I told you that I saw you under the fig tree, do you believe? You will see greater things than these.”
043	JOH	001	051	And He told him, “Most assuredly, I tell you, you will see Heaven opened, and God’s angels ascending and descending on the Son of Man.”
043	JOH	002	001	On the third day there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee, and Jesus’ mother was there.
043	JOH	002	002	Now both Jesus and His disciples were invited to the wedding.
043	JOH	002	003	When they ran out of wine, Jesus’ mother told Him, “They have no wine.”
043	JOH	002	004	Jesus said to her, “Woman, what does that have to do with you and me? My time has not yet come.”
043	JOH	002	005	His mother told the servants, “Do whatever He tells you.”
043	JOH	002	006	Nearby stood six stone water jars, the kind used by the Jews for ceremonial washing, each holding two to three metretes.
043	JOH	002	007	Jesus told the servants, “Fill the jars with water,” so they filled them to the brim.
043	JOH	002	008	Then He told them, “Now draw some out and take it to the master of the banquet.” They did so,
043	JOH	002	009	and the master of the banquet tasted the water that had been turned into wine. He didn’t realize where it had come from, though the servants who had drawn the water knew. Then he called the bridegroom aside
043	JOH	002	010	and said, “Everyone brings out the choice wine first, and then the cheaper wine after the guests have drunk freely, but you have saved the best till now!”
043	JOH	002	011	Jesus did this beginning of signs in Cana of Galilee. He revealed His glory, and His disciples believed in Him.
043	JOH	002	012	After this, He went down to Capernaum with His mother, His brothers, and His disciples, and they stayed there only a few days.
043	JOH	002	013	The time for the Passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
043	JOH	002	014	He found in the temple those who sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the money changers doing business.
043	JOH	002	015	When He had made a whip of cords, He drove them all out of the temple, with the sheep and the oxen, and poured out the changers’ money and overturned the tables.
043	JOH	002	016	He told those who sold doves, “Take these things away! Don’t make my Father’s house a market place!”
043	JOH	002	017	Then His disciples remembered that it was written, “Zeal for Your house will consume me.”
043	JOH	002	018	So the Jews answered and asked Him, “What sign do You show to us, since You do these things?”
043	JOH	002	019	Jesus answered them, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.”
043	JOH	002	020	Then the Jews said, “It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and will You raise it up in three days?”
043	JOH	002	021	But the temple He had spoken of was His body.
043	JOH	002	022	After He was raised from the dead, His disciples recalled what He had said. Then they believed the Scripture and the words that Jesus had spoken.
043	JOH	002	023	Now while He was in Jerusalem at the Passover Feast, many people saw the miraculous signs He was doing and believed in His name.
043	JOH	002	024	But Jesus didn’t commit Himself to them, because He knew all people,
043	JOH	002	025	and had no need for anyone to testify about people, for He knew what was in people.
043	JOH	003	001	There was a Pharisee, a man named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.
043	JOH	003	002	This man came to Jesus by night, and said to Him, “Rabbi, we know that You have come from God as a teacher, for no one can do these signs that You do unless God is with him.”
043	JOH	003	003	Jesus answered and told him, “Most assuredly, I tell you, unless one is born again, that person can’t see the kingdom of God.”
043	JOH	003	004	Nicodemus asked Him, “How can a man be born when he is old? He can’t go back into his mother’s womb and be born, can he?”
043	JOH	003	005	Jesus answered, “Most assuredly, I tell you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, that one can’t enter the Kingdom of God.
043	JOH	003	006	That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.
043	JOH	003	007	Don’t marvel that I told you, ‘You must be born again.’
043	JOH	003	008	The wind blows where it wants to, and you hear its sound, but can’t tell where it comes from and where it goes. So is everyone who is born of the Spirit.”
043	JOH	003	009	Nicodemus asked Him, “How can these things be?”
043	JOH	003	010	“Are you Israel’s teacher,” asked Jesus, “and yet you don’t understand these things?
043	JOH	003	011	Most assuredly, I tell you, we speak what we know and testify what we have seen, and you don’t receive our witness.
043	JOH	003	012	If I have told you earthly things and you don’t believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?
043	JOH	003	013	No one has ever gone up into Heaven except the one who came from Heaven — the Son of Man.
043	JOH	003	014	Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the desert, so the Son of Man must be lifted up,
043	JOH	003	015	that everyone who believes in Him should not die, but have eternal life.
043	JOH	003	016	For God so sincerely loved the world that He gave His only born Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
043	JOH	003	017	For God didn’t send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through Him.
043	JOH	003	018	Whoever believes in Him is not condemned, but whoever doesn’t believe is condemned already because that person has not believed in the name of God’s only Son.
043	JOH	003	019	This is the condemnation, that light has come into the world, but people sincerely loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.
043	JOH	003	020	Everyone who practices evil hates the light, and doesn’t come to the light, for fear that their deeds will be exposed.
043	JOH	003	021	Whoever practices the truth comes to the light to show clearly that their deeds have been done with God.”
043	JOH	003	022	After this, Jesus and His disciples went out into the countryside of Judea, where He remained with them, and baptized.
043	JOH	003	023	John was also baptizing at Aenon, near Salim, because there was plenty of water there, and people kept coming to be baptized.
043	JOH	003	024	John had not yet been thrown into prison.
043	JOH	003	025	There were some questions between some of John’s disciples and the Jews about purification.
043	JOH	003	026	They came to John and told him, “Rabbi, He who was with you beyond the Jordan, that you have testified about — look, He is baptizing, and everyone is flocking to Him!”
043	JOH	003	027	John replied, “A man can receive nothing, unless it’s given to him from Heaven.
043	JOH	003	028	You yourselves can testify that I said, ‘I’m not the Christ, but I have been sent ahead of Him.’
043	JOH	003	029	The bride belongs to the bridegroom. The friend who attends the bridegroom waits and listens for him, and rejoices when he hears the bridegroom’s voice. This joy of mine is now made complete.
043	JOH	003	030	He must increase, but I must decrease.
043	JOH	003	031	“He who comes from above is above all. He who is of the Earth belongs to the Earth and speaks of the Earth. He who comes from Heaven is above all.
043	JOH	003	032	He testifies about what He has seen and heard, but no one accepts His testimony.
043	JOH	003	033	The man who has accepted His testimony has certified that God is truthful.
043	JOH	003	034	The one that God has sent speaks God’s words, for God gives the Spirit without measure.
043	JOH	003	035	The Father sincerely loves the Son, and has given everything into His hand.
043	JOH	003	036	Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son won’t see life, for God’s wrath remains on that person.”
043	JOH	004	001	Therefore when the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was gaining and baptizing more disciples than John
043	JOH	004	002	(although Jesus Himself wasn’t baptizing, but His disciples were),
043	JOH	004	003	He left Judea, and went back towards Galilee.
043	JOH	004	004	He had to go through Samaria.
043	JOH	004	005	He came to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph,
043	JOH	004	006	and Jacob’s well was there. Jesus therefore, being tired from His journey, sat down by the well. It was about the sixth hour.
043	JOH	004	007	A Samaritan woman came to draw water. Jesus said to her, “Please give me a drink.”
043	JOH	004	008	His disciples had gone into the town to buy food.
043	JOH	004	009	The Samaritan woman therefore asked Him, “How is it that You, being a Jew, ask me for a drink, since I’m a Samaritan woman?” (For Jews have nothing to do with Samaritans.)
043	JOH	004	010	Jesus answered her, “If you knew God’s gift, and who it is who says to you, ‘Please give me a drink,’ you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water.”
043	JOH	004	011	The woman said, “Sir, you have nothing to draw with and the well is deep. Where could you get this living water from?
043	JOH	004	012	Are You greater than our forefather Jacob, who gave us this well and who used to drink from it himself, as did also his sons and his flocks and herds?”
043	JOH	004	013	Jesus answered her, “Everyone who drinks of this water will get thirsty again,
043	JOH	004	014	but whoever drinks the water that I will give will never, ever get thirsty. The water that I will give will become in that person a fountain of water springing up into everlasting life.”
043	JOH	004	015	The woman said to him, “Sir, give me this water so that I won’t get thirsty and have to keep coming all the way here to draw water.”
043	JOH	004	016	Jesus told her, “Go, call your husband, and come here.”
043	JOH	004	017	The woman answered, “I have no husband.” Jesus told her, “You are right in saying, ‘I have no husband,’
043	JOH	004	018	for you have had five husbands, and the one you have now isn’t your husband. What you have said is quite true.”
043	JOH	004	019	The woman said to Him, “Sir, I perceive that You are a prophet.
043	JOH	004	020	Our ancestors worshipped on this mountain, but you Jews say that the place where we must worship is in Jerusalem.”
043	JOH	004	021	Jesus told her, “Woman, believe me, a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem.
043	JOH	004	022	You Samaritans worship what you don’t know. We worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews.
043	JOH	004	023	A time is coming, and has now come, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for they are the kind of worshipers that the Father seeks.
043	JOH	004	024	God is spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth.”
043	JOH	004	025	The woman said to Him, “I know that the Messiah (who is called Christ) is coming. When He comes, He will explain everything to us.”
043	JOH	004	026	Jesus told her, “I who speak to you am He.”
043	JOH	004	027	Just then Jesus’ disciples returned. They were surprised to find him talking with a woman, but no one asked, “What do you want?” or “Why are you talking with her?”
043	JOH	004	028	Then, leaving her water jar, the woman went back to the town and began telling the people,
043	JOH	004	029	“Come, see a man who told me everything that I ever did. Could this be the Christ?”
043	JOH	004	030	They went out of the city, and started to go to Him.
043	JOH	004	031	Meanwhile, the disciples urged Him, saying “Rabbi, eat something.”
043	JOH	004	032	He told them, “I have food to eat that you don’t know about.”
043	JOH	004	033	So the disciples asked one another, “Nobody brought Him anything to eat, did they?”
043	JOH	004	034	Jesus told them, “My food is to do the will of Him who sent me, and to accomplish His work.
043	JOH	004	035	Don’t you say, ‘It’s still four months until the harvest’? Look, I tell you, lift up your eyes, and look at the fields! They are ripe for harvest.
043	JOH	004	036	He who harvests is already receiving wages, and is gathering fruit for eternal life, so that he who plants and he who harvests may rejoice together.
043	JOH	004	037	Thus the saying ‘One plants and another harvests’ is true.
043	JOH	004	038	I sent you to harvest that for which you didn’t labor. Others have labored, and you have entered into their labor.”
043	JOH	004	039	Many Samaritans from that town believed in Jesus because of the woman’s testimony, “He told me everything that I ever did.”
043	JOH	004	040	So when the Samaritans arrived, they asked Him to stay with them, and He stayed there two days.
043	JOH	004	041	Many more believed because of His words.
043	JOH	004	042	They told the woman, “It’s no longer just because of what you said that we believe, for we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this is truly the Savior of the world, the Christ.”
043	JOH	004	043	After the two days, He departed from there and went to Galilee,
043	JOH	004	044	for Jesus Himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country.
043	JOH	004	045	When He arrived in Galilee, the Galileans welcomed Him. They had seen all that He had done in Jerusalem at the Passover Feast, for they had been there, too.
043	JOH	004	046	Therefore He came back to Cana of Galilee, where He had made the water wine. There was a certain royal official, whose son was sick at Capernaum.
043	JOH	004	047	When he heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee, he went to Him and begged Him to come down and heal his son, who was at the point of death.
043	JOH	004	048	Jesus told him, “Unless you people see signs and wonders, you will never believe.”
043	JOH	004	049	The royal official said to Him, “Sir, come down before my child dies!”
043	JOH	004	050	Jesus told him, “Go in peace. Your son lives.” So the man believed the words that Jesus spoke to him, and he went his way.
043	JOH	004	051	As he was still going down the road, his servants met him, saying that his son was living.
043	JOH	004	052	So he asked them the hour when he began to recover, and they told him, “Yesterday at the seventh hour, the fever left him.”
043	JOH	004	053	The father realized that it was at that hour that Jesus told him, “Your son lives,” and he himself believed, along with his whole household.
043	JOH	004	054	This was the second sign that Jesus did, when He had come from out of Judea to Galilee.
043	JOH	005	001	After this, there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
043	JOH	005	002	Near the Sheep Gate in Jerusalem, there is a pool, which is called Bethesda in Hebrew. It’s surrounded by five covered colonnades.
043	JOH	005	003	In these lay a great multitude of sick people, blind, lame, or paralyzed, waiting for the moving of the water,
043	JOH	005	004	for an angel went down from time to time into the pool and stirred up the water. Whoever stepped in first, after the stirring of the water, was made well of whatever disease that person had.
043	JOH	005	005	A certain man was there who had an infirmity thirty-eight years.
043	JOH	005	006	When Jesus saw him lying there, and knew that he had already been sick for a long time, He asked him, “Do you want to be made well?”
043	JOH	005	007	The sick man answered, “Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up, but while I’m coming, another steps down before me.”
043	JOH	005	008	Jesus told him, “Stand up, pick up your mat, and walk.”
043	JOH	005	009	Immediately, the man was made well, took up his mat, and walked. That was on the Sabbath day.
043	JOH	005	010	Therefore the Jews were telling him who was cured, “It’s the Sabbath, and it isn’t legal for you to carry your mat.”
043	JOH	005	011	He answered them, “He who made me well told me, ‘Take up your mat and walk.’”
043	JOH	005	012	Then they asked him, “Who told you to ‘Take up your mat and walk’?”
043	JOH	005	013	The man who had been healed didn’t know who it was, because Jesus had disappeared into the crowd.
043	JOH	005	014	Later, Jesus found him in the temple and told him, “See, you have been made well! Don’t sin any more, so that nothing worse happens to you.”
043	JOH	005	015	The man went away, and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.
043	JOH	005	016	For this reason, the Jews persecuted Jesus, and sought to kill Him, because He was doing these things on the Sabbath.
043	JOH	005	017	Jesus answered them, “My Father is still working, so I am working, too.”
043	JOH	005	018	Because of this, the Jews tried all the harder to kill Him. Not only was He breaking the Sabbath, but He was even calling God His own Father, making Himself equal with God.
043	JOH	005	019	Then Jesus answered, “Most assuredly, I tell you, the Son can do nothing of Himself, unless He sees the Father do it, for whatever He does, the Son does likewise.
043	JOH	005	020	The Father loves the Son, and shows Him everything that He Himself does. He will show Him even greater works than these, that you may marvel.
043	JOH	005	021	As the Father raises the dead and gives life to them, even so the Son gives life to whoever He wishes.
043	JOH	005	022	The Father judges no one, but has committed all judgment to the Son,
043	JOH	005	023	that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. He who doesn’t honor the Son doesn’t honor the Father who sent Him.
043	JOH	005	024	“Most assuredly, I tell you, the person who hears my words and believes in Him who sent me has everlasting life, and won’t come into judgment, but has passed from death into life.
043	JOH	005	025	Most assuredly, I tell you, the time is coming, and now is, when the dead will hear the voice of God’s Son, and those who hear will live.
043	JOH	005	026	For just as the Father has life in Himself, so He has granted the Son to have life in Himself,
043	JOH	005	027	and has given Him authority to execute judgment, because He is the Son of Man.
043	JOH	005	028	Don’t marvel at this, for the time is coming in which all who are in the graves will hear His voice
043	JOH	005	029	and come out — those who have done good, to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of condemnation.
043	JOH	005	030	I can do nothing by myself. As I hear, I judge, and my judgment is righteous, because I don’t seek my own will, but the will of the Father who sent me.
043	JOH	005	031	“If I testify about myself, my testimony isn’t valid.
043	JOH	005	032	There is another who testifies on my behalf, and I know that his testimony about me is valid.
043	JOH	005	033	You have sent to John, and he has testified to the truth.
043	JOH	005	034	Not that I accept human testimony, but I tell you this so that you may be saved.
043	JOH	005	035	John was the burning and shining lamp, and you were willing for a time to rejoice in his light.
043	JOH	005	036	I have a greater testimony than John’s. The works that the Father has given me to finish — the very works that I do — testify about me, that the Father has sent me.
043	JOH	005	037	The Father Himself, who sent me, has testified about me. You have neither heard His voice at any time, nor seen His form.
043	JOH	005	038	You don’t have His words dwelling in you, because you don’t believe the One who He sent.
043	JOH	005	039	You search the Scriptures, for in them you think you have eternal life, and these testify about me.
043	JOH	005	040	Yet you refuse to come to me to have life.
043	JOH	005	041	“I don’t accept glory from men,
043	JOH	005	042	but I know you. I know that you don’t have God’s sincere love in you.
043	JOH	005	043	I have come in my Father’s name, and you don’t accept me, but if someone else comes in his own name, you will accept him.
043	JOH	005	044	How can you believe when you accept glory from one another, and don’t seek the glory that comes from the only God?
043	JOH	005	045	“Don’t think that I will accuse you before the Father. Your accuser is Moses, who you have set your hope on.
043	JOH	005	046	If you believed Moses, you would believe me, for he wrote about me.
043	JOH	005	047	If you don’t believe what he wrote, how will you believe what I say?”
043	JOH	006	001	After this, Jesus went to the other side of the Sea of Galilee, also called the Sea of Tiberias.
043	JOH	006	002	A great multitude was following Him, because they were seeing the signs that He was performing on those who were sick.
043	JOH	006	003	Jesus went up on a mountain side, and sat down with His disciples.
043	JOH	006	004	The Jewish Passover Feast was near.
043	JOH	006	005	Jesus looked up, and saw that a great multitude was coming to Him, so He asked Philip, “Where can we buy bread, so that these may eat?”
043	JOH	006	006	He said this to test him, for He knew what He would do.
043	JOH	006	007	Philip answered, “Two hundred denarii worth of bread wouldn’t even be enough for everyone to receive a little!”
043	JOH	006	008	One of Jesus’ disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, said to Him,
043	JOH	006	009	“There is a boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish, but what is that among so many people?”
043	JOH	006	010	Jesus said, “Have the people sit down.” There was plenty of grass there, so the men sat down, in number about five thousand.
043	JOH	006	011	Jesus took the loaves, and when He had given thanks, He distributed them to the disciples, and the disciples to those sitting down. He did likewise with the fish, as much as they wanted.
043	JOH	006	012	When they were filled, He told His disciples, “Gather up the leftover pieces, so that nothing may be wasted.”
043	JOH	006	013	Therefore they gathered them up, and filled twelve baskets with the pieces of the five barley loaves, which were left over by those who had eaten.
043	JOH	006	014	When the people saw the sign which He had performed, they said, “This is truly the Prophet who is to come into the world.”
043	JOH	006	015	When Jesus perceived that they meant to come and take Him by force to make Him king, He withdrew again to the mountain by Himself.
043	JOH	006	016	When evening came, Jesus’ disciples went down to the sea,
043	JOH	006	017	got into the boat, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. It was already dark, and Jesus had not come to them.
043	JOH	006	018	The sea arose because a great wind was blowing.
043	JOH	006	019	When they had rowed about twenty-five or thirty stadia, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and drawing near the boat. They were terrified,
043	JOH	006	020	but He told them, “It’s me. Don’t be afraid.”
043	JOH	006	021	Then they willingly took Him into the boat, and immediately the boat was at the land where they were going.
043	JOH	006	022	The next day, the crowd that had stayed on the other side of the sea saw that there had been only one boat there. They also saw that Jesus had not gone in the boat with His disciples, but that His disciples had gone away alone.
043	JOH	006	023	Then some other boats from Tiberias landed near the place where the people had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks.
043	JOH	006	024	When the crowd saw that neither Jesus nor His disciples were there, they got into the boats and went to Capernaum looking for Jesus.
043	JOH	006	025	When they found Him on the other side of the sea, they asked Him, “Rabbi, when did you come here?”
043	JOH	006	026	Jesus answered, “Most assuredly, I tell you, you are looking for me, not because you saw the signs, but because you ate the loaves and were filled.
043	JOH	006	027	Don’t labor for perishable food, but for the food which endures to everlasting life, which the Son of Man will give you, because God the Father has set His seal on Him.”
043	JOH	006	028	Then they asked Him, “What must we do to do God’s works?”
043	JOH	006	029	Jesus answered them, “This is God’s work, that you believe in Him who He has sent.”
043	JOH	006	030	Therefore they asked Him, “What sign will You perform then, that we may see it and believe You? What work will You do?
043	JOH	006	031	Our ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness. As it’s written, ‘He gave them bread from Heaven to eat.’”
043	JOH	006	032	Jesus told them, “Most assuredly, I tell you, Moses didn’t give you the bread from Heaven, but my Father gives you the true bread from Heaven.
043	JOH	006	033	For God’s bread is He who comes down from Heaven and gives life to the world.”
043	JOH	006	034	Then they said to Him, “Lord, give us this bread forever.”
043	JOH	006	035	Jesus told them, “I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never be hungry, and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty.
043	JOH	006	036	As I told you, you have seen me, and yet you still don’t believe.
043	JOH	006	037	All that the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never drive away.
043	JOH	006	038	I have come down from Heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of Him who sent me.
043	JOH	006	039	This is the will of the Father who sent me, that of all He has given me I should lose none, but should raise them up at the last day.
043	JOH	006	040	This is also the will of Him who sent me, that everyone who sees the Son and believes in Him may have everlasting life; and I will raise them up at the last day.”
043	JOH	006	041	The Jews then grumbled about Jesus, because He said, “I am the bread which came down from Heaven.”
043	JOH	006	042	They were saying, “Isn’t this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How can He claim, ‘I have come down from Heaven’?”
043	JOH	006	043	Jesus answered, “Stop grumbling among yourselves.
043	JOH	006	044	No one can come to me unless drawn by the Father who sent me, and I will raise that person up on the last day.
043	JOH	006	045	It’s written in the prophets, ‘They will all be taught by God.’ Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me.
043	JOH	006	046	Nobody has seen the Father except the one who is from God. He has seen the Father.
043	JOH	006	047	Most assuredly, I tell you, everyone who believes in me has everlasting life.
043	JOH	006	048	I am the bread of life.
043	JOH	006	049	Your forefathers ate manna in the wilderness, but they died.
043	JOH	006	050	This is the bread which comes down from Heaven, so that one may eat of it and not die.
043	JOH	006	051	I am the living bread that came down from Heaven. Whoever eats of this bread will live forever. The bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh.”
043	JOH	006	052	Therefore the Jews argued among themselves, saying, “How can this Man give us His flesh to eat?”
043	JOH	006	053	Then Jesus told them, “Most assuredly, I tell you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man, and drink His blood, you have no life in you.
043	JOH	006	054	Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise that person up at the last day,
043	JOH	006	055	for my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink.
043	JOH	006	056	One who eats my flesh and drinks my blood lives in me, and I in that person.
043	JOH	006	057	Just as the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so the one who feeds on me will live because of me.
043	JOH	006	058	This is the bread which came down from Heaven, not like the manna your forefathers ate, and died. A person who eats this bread will live forever.”
043	JOH	006	059	He said this while teaching in the synagogue at Capernaum.
043	JOH	006	060	Therefore when many of His disciples heard this, they said, “This is a hard teaching. Who can stand to hear it?”
043	JOH	006	061	Jesus, aware that his disciples were complaining about this, asked them, “Does this offend you?
043	JOH	006	062	What if you saw the Son of Man ascend to where He was before?
043	JOH	006	063	The Spirit gives life. The flesh profits nothing. The words that I speak to you are spirit and life.
043	JOH	006	064	Yet there are some of you who don’t believe.” Jesus knew from the beginning who didn’t believe, and who would betray Him.
043	JOH	006	065	He said, “For this reason I have told you, that no one can come to me, unless it has been granted by the Father.”
043	JOH	006	066	Because of this, many of His disciples turned back and didn’t walk with him any more.
043	JOH	006	067	Then Jesus asked the twelve, “Do you want to go away, too?”
043	JOH	006	068	Simon Peter answered Him, “Lord, who will we go to? You have words of eternal life.
043	JOH	006	069	We have come to believe and know that You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.”
043	JOH	006	070	Jesus answered, “Didn’t I choose you, the twelve, yet one of you is a slanderer?”
043	JOH	006	071	He was speaking of Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son, for he, one of the twelve, was going to betray him.
043	JOH	007	001	After these things, Jesus walked in Galilee, for He didn’t want to walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill Him.
043	JOH	007	002	Now the Jews’ Feast of Tabernacles was near.
043	JOH	007	003	Therefore His brothers told Him, “Leave here and go to Judea, so that Your disciples will see the works that You are doing, too.
043	JOH	007	004	Nobody does anything in secret while he seeks to be known openly. If You do these things, show Yourself to the world.”
043	JOH	007	005	For even His brothers didn’t believe in Him.
043	JOH	007	006	Then Jesus told them, “My time hasn’t yet come, but your time is always right.
043	JOH	007	007	The world can’t hate you, but it hates me because I testify that its works are evil.
043	JOH	007	008	Go up to this feast yourselves. I’m not going up to this feast, yet, for my time hasn’t yet fully come.”
043	JOH	007	009	Having said these things to them, He stayed in Galilee.
043	JOH	007	010	When His brothers had gone up to the feast, however, Jesus also went up, not publicly, but in secret.
043	JOH	007	011	The Jews were looking for Him at the feast, and saying, “Where is He?”
043	JOH	007	012	There was much complaining among the people about Him. Some said, “He is good,” but others said, “No, He deceives the people.”
043	JOH	007	013	No one spoke openly of Him for fear of the Jews.
043	JOH	007	014	About the middle of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple and began to teach.
043	JOH	007	015	The Jews marveled, saying, “How does this man know letters, having never been educated?”
043	JOH	007	016	Jesus answered, “My teaching isn’t mine, but His who sent me.
043	JOH	007	017	Anyone who wants to do His will shall know if the teaching is from God or if I speak on my own.
043	JOH	007	018	The one who speaks on his own seeks his own glory; but He who seeks the glory of the One who sent Him is true, and no unrighteousness is in Him.
043	JOH	007	019	Didn’t Moses give you the Law, yet none of you keeps the Law? Why are you trying to kill me?”
043	JOH	007	020	The people answered, “You have a demon. Who is trying to kill You?”
043	JOH	007	021	Jesus answered, “I did one work, and you all marvel.
043	JOH	007	022	Moses gave you circumcision (not that it’s from Moses, but from the forefathers), and you circumcise a boy on the Sabbath.
043	JOH	007	023	If a boy gets circumcised on the Sabbath, so that the Law of Moses should not be broken, are you angry with me because I made a man completely well on the Sabbath?
043	JOH	007	024	Don’t judge by appearance, but judge with righteous judgment.”
043	JOH	007	025	Some of the people of Jerusalem said, “Isn’t this the man they are trying to kill?
043	JOH	007	026	Look! He is speaking boldly, and they say nothing to Him. The rulers haven’t really concluded that this is the Christ, have they?
043	JOH	007	027	Still, we know where this man is from, but when the Christ comes, no one will know where He is from.”
043	JOH	007	028	Then Jesus cried out, as He taught in the temple, “You know me, and you know where I’m from. I haven’t come of my own accord, but He who sent me is true, who you don’t know.
043	JOH	007	029	I know Him, because I am from Him, and He sent me.”
043	JOH	007	030	Because of this, they were seeking to seize Him, but no one laid hands on Him, because His time had not yet come.
043	JOH	007	031	Many of the people believed in Him, saying, “When the Christ comes, will He do more signs than this man has done?”
043	JOH	007	032	The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these things about Jesus, and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to seize Him.
043	JOH	007	033	Then Jesus told them, “I will be with you a little while longer, and then I am going to Him who sent me.
043	JOH	007	034	You will look for me, and not find me, and where I am, you can’t come.”
043	JOH	007	035	Then the Jews said among themselves, “Where does He intend to go that we won’t be able to find Him? He doesn’t intend to go to the dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks, does He?
043	JOH	007	036	What does He mean by saying, ‘You will look for me, and not find me, and where I am, you can’t come’?”
043	JOH	007	037	On the last and greatest day of the feast, Jesus stood and declared loudly, “If anyone is thirsty, let that person come to me and drink.
043	JOH	007	038	Rivers of living water will flow from within whoever believes in me, as the Scripture has said.”
043	JOH	007	039	He said this about the Spirit, who those believing in Him would receive. The Holy Spirit wasn’t yet given, because Jesus wasn’t yet glorified.
043	JOH	007	040	When they heard these words, many in the crowd were saying, “This is really the prophet.”
043	JOH	007	041	Others were saying, “This is the Christ,” but some were saying, “Surely the Christ isn’t going to come from Galilee, is He?
043	JOH	007	042	Hasn’t the Scripture said that the Christ comes from the seed of David and from the town of Bethlehem, where David was?”
043	JOH	007	043	So there was a division among the crowd because of Jesus.
043	JOH	007	044	Some of them wanted to seize Him, but no one laid hands on Him.
043	JOH	007	045	When the officers went back to the chief priests and Pharisees, they asked them, “Why didn’t you bring Him in?”
043	JOH	007	046	The officers answered, “No man ever spoke like this man!”
043	JOH	007	047	Then the Pharisees answered, “You haven’t been deceived, too, have you?
043	JOH	007	048	Have any of the rulers or Pharisees believed in Him?
043	JOH	007	049	But this accursed crowd doesn’t know the Law.”
043	JOH	007	050	Nicodemus (who came to Jesus before, being one of them) asked them,
043	JOH	007	051	“Does our Law permit us to judge a man before hearing him and finding out what he is doing?”
043	JOH	007	052	They answered him, “You aren’t from Galilee, too, are you? Search and you will see that no prophet comes out of Galilee.”
043	JOH	007	053	Then everyone went home,
043	JOH	008	001	but Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.
043	JOH	008	002	At dawn, He came back into the temple. All the people were coming to Him, and He sat down and began to teach them.
043	JOH	008	003	The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman caught in adultery, and having set her in the midst,
043	JOH	008	004	they told Him, “Teacher, this woman has been caught in adultery, in the very act.
043	JOH	008	005	In the Law, Moses commanded us to stone such women. What do You say?”
043	JOH	008	006	They were saying this, testing Him, so that they might have grounds to accuse Him. Jesus stooped down and wrote on the ground with His finger, as if He didn’t hear.
043	JOH	008	007	When they persisted in asking Him, He straightened up, and told them, “Let whoever is without sin among you be the first to throw a stone at her.”
043	JOH	008	008	He stooped down, again, and wrote on the ground.
043	JOH	008	009	When they heard this, they began to go out one by one, beginning with the older ones. Jesus was left alone with the woman still standing there.
043	JOH	008	010	Straightening up, Jesus asked her, “Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?”
043	JOH	008	011	She said, “No one, Lord.” Jesus said, “Neither do I condemn you. Go and sin no more.”
043	JOH	008	012	Jesus spoke again to the people, saying, “I am the light of the world. Anyone who follows me won’t walk in the darkness, but will have the light of life.”
043	JOH	008	013	Then the Pharisees told Him, “You are testifying on your own behalf, so your testimony isn’t valid.”
043	JOH	008	014	Jesus answered, “Even if I testify on my own behalf, my testimony is valid because I know where I came from and where I am going, but you don’t know where I come from or where I am going.
043	JOH	008	015	You judge by human standards, but I am not judging anyone.
043	JOH	008	016	Even if I do judge, my judgment is true, because I am not alone, but I am with the Father who sent me.
043	JOH	008	017	It’s also written in your Law that the testimony of two men is valid.
043	JOH	008	018	I am one who bears witness of myself, and my Father who sent me bears witness of me.”
043	JOH	008	019	Then they asked Him, “Where is Your Father?” Jesus answered, “You know neither me nor my Father. If you had known me, you would have known my Father, too.”
043	JOH	008	020	Jesus spoke these words in the treasury, as He taught in the temple. Nobody laid hands on Him, for His time had not yet come.
043	JOH	008	021	Jesus told them again, “I am going away, and you will look for me, and you will die in your sin. Where I am going, you can’t come.”
043	JOH	008	022	Therefore the Jews were saying, “Surely He won’t kill Himself, will He, since He says, ‘Where I am going, you can’t come’?”
043	JOH	008	023	Jesus was saying to them, “You are from below. I am from above. You are of this world. I am not of this world.
043	JOH	008	024	Therefore I told you that you will die in your sins, because if you don’t believe that I am He, you will die in your sins.”
043	JOH	008	025	Then they asked Him, “Who are You?” Jesus told them, “Just what I have been saying to you from the beginning.
043	JOH	008	026	I have many things to say and judge about you, but He who sent me is true, and I speak to the world those things which I heard from Him.”
043	JOH	008	027	They didn’t realize that He had been speaking to them about the Father.
043	JOH	008	028	So, Jesus said, “When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am He, and that I do nothing on my own, but I speak these things as the Father taught me.
043	JOH	008	029	He who sent me is with me. He hasn’t left me alone, because I always do the things that are pleasing to Him.”
043	JOH	008	030	As Jesus spoke, many came to believe in Him.
043	JOH	008	031	Then Jesus said to those Jews who believed Him, “If you continue in my words, you are truly my disciples,
043	JOH	008	032	and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.”
043	JOH	008	033	They answered Him, “We are Abraham’s descendants, and have never been slaves to anyone. How can you say that we’ll be set free?”
043	JOH	008	034	Jesus answered them, “Most assuredly, I tell you, whoever sins is a slave of sin.
043	JOH	008	035	A slave doesn’t remain in the house forever, but a son does belong forever.
043	JOH	008	036	Therefore if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed.
043	JOH	008	037	“I know that you are Abraham’s descendants, but you seek to kill me, because my word has no place in you.
043	JOH	008	038	I talk about what I have seen with my Father, and you do what you have heard from your father.”
043	JOH	008	039	They answered, “Abraham is our father.” Jesus told them, “If you were Abraham’s children, you would do the works of Abraham,
043	JOH	008	040	but now you seek to kill me, a man who has told you the truth which I heard from God. Abraham didn’t do this.
043	JOH	008	041	You do the deeds of your father.” Then they said to Him, “We weren’t born of fornication. We have one Father — God.”
043	JOH	008	042	Jesus said, “If God were your Father, you would sincerely love me, for I came from God, and now am here. I haven’t come of my own initiative, but He sent me.
043	JOH	008	043	Why don’t you understand what I say? It’s because you can’t accept my words.
043	JOH	008	044	You are of your father, the Devil, and you want to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning, and doesn’t stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. Whenever he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own nature, because he is a liar, and the father of lies.
043	JOH	008	045	Because I tell the truth, you don’t believe me.
043	JOH	008	046	Which of you convicts me of sin? If I tell the truth, why don’t you believe me?
043	JOH	008	047	Whoever is from God hears God’s words. The reason you don’t hear them is that you aren’t from God.”
043	JOH	008	048	The Jews answered and asked Him, “Aren’t we right in saying that You are a Samaritan and have a demon?”
043	JOH	008	049	Jesus answered, “I don’t have a demon, but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me.
043	JOH	008	050	I don’t seek glory for myself, but there is One who seeks it, and He is the judge.
043	JOH	008	051	Most assuredly, I tell you, anyone who keeps my word will never see death.”
043	JOH	008	052	Then the Jews answered Him, “Now we know that You have a demon! Abraham is dead, and the prophets, and You say, ‘Anyone who keeps my word will never taste death.’
043	JOH	008	053	Surely You aren’t greater than our forefather Abraham, who died? The prophets died too. Who do You claim to be?”
043	JOH	008	054	Jesus answered, “If I honor myself, my honor is nothing. It’s my Father, who you say is your God, who honors me.
043	JOH	008	055	Yet you haven’t come to know Him, but I know Him. If I said, ‘I don’t know Him,’ I would be a liar like you, but I do know Him and keep His word.
043	JOH	008	056	Your forefather Abraham rejoiced that he would see my day, and he saw it and was glad.”
043	JOH	008	057	Then the Jews said to Him, “You aren’t yet fifty years old, and You have seen Abraham?”
043	JOH	008	058	Jesus told them, “Most assuredly, I tell you, before Abraham was, I AM.”
043	JOH	008	059	Then they took up stones to throw at Him, but Jesus hid Himself and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.
043	JOH	009	001	Passing by, Jesus saw a man who was blind from birth.
043	JOH	009	002	His disciples asked Him, “Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?”
043	JOH	009	003	Jesus answered, “Neither this man nor his parents sinned, but this happened so that God’s works might be revealed in this man.
043	JOH	009	004	We must work the works of Him who sent me, as long as it’s day. Night is coming, when nobody can work.
043	JOH	009	005	As long as I am in the world, I am the world’s light.”
043	JOH	009	006	After Jesus said this, He spat on the ground and made mud with the saliva, put it on the blind man’s eyes,
043	JOH	009	007	and told him, “Go, wash in the pool of Siloam” (which means Sent). So he went away and washed, and came back seeing.
043	JOH	009	008	Then the neighbors and those who used to see him as a beggar began to ask, “Isn’t this the man who used to sit and beg?”
043	JOH	009	009	Some were saying, “Yes, it is he,” others were saying, “No, but he is like him.” He kept saying, “I’m the one.”
043	JOH	009	010	So they asked him, “How were your eyes opened?”
043	JOH	009	011	He answered, “The man called Jesus made mud, put it on my eyes, and told me, ‘Go to Siloam, and wash’; so I went and washed, and I received sight.”
043	JOH	009	012	“Where is this man?” they asked him. “I don’t know,” he said.
043	JOH	009	013	They brought the man who used to be blind to the Pharisees.
043	JOH	009	014	Now it was a sabbath day when Jesus made the mud and opened the man’s eyes.
043	JOH	009	015	So the Pharisees were also asking him how he received his sight. He told them, “He applied mud to my eyes, I washed, and I see.”
043	JOH	009	016	Therefore some of the Pharisees said, “This Man isn’t from God, because He doesn’t keep the Sabbath.” Others said, “How can a sinner do such signs?” So there was a division among them.
043	JOH	009	017	So they turned again to the blind man and asked, “What do you say about him? It was your eyes he opened.” He said, “He is a prophet.”
043	JOH	009	018	The Jews didn’t believe that he had been blind, and had received sight, until they called the parents of the one who had received his sight,
043	JOH	009	019	and questioned them, saying, “Is this your son, who you say was born blind? Then how does he now see?”
043	JOH	009	020	His parents answered them, “We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind,
043	JOH	009	021	but how he now sees, we don’t know. Who opened his eyes, we don’t know. Ask him. He is of age. He will speak for himself.”
043	JOH	009	022	His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews, for the Jews had already agreed that if anyone would confess that Jesus was the Christ, they would be put out of the synagogue.
043	JOH	009	023	For this reason, his parents said, “Ask him. He is of age.”
043	JOH	009	024	So they called the man who had been blind a second time, and told him, “Give glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner.”
043	JOH	009	025	He answered, “Whether He is a sinner or not I don’t know. One thing I do know: that though I was blind, now I see.”
043	JOH	009	026	Then they asked him again, “What did He do to you? How did He open your eyes?”
043	JOH	009	027	He answered, “I told you already, and you didn’t listen. Why do you want to hear it again? You don’t want to become His disciples, too, do you?”
043	JOH	009	028	Then they became abusive towards him and said, “You are that man’s disciple, but we are Moses’ disciples.
043	JOH	009	029	We know that God spoke to Moses, but as for this man, we don’t know where He is from.”
043	JOH	009	030	The man answered, “How amazing! You don’t know where He comes from, yet He opened my eyes.
043	JOH	009	031	We know that God doesn’t hear sinners, but if anyone is God-fearing, and does His will, He hears him.
043	JOH	009	032	Since the beginning of time it has never been heard of that anyone opened the eyes of a person born blind.
043	JOH	009	033	If this man weren’t from God, He could do nothing.”
043	JOH	009	034	To this they replied, “Who are you to teach us? You were born entirely in sin!” Then they threw him out.
043	JOH	009	035	Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and finding him, He said, “Do you believe in the Son of Man?”
043	JOH	009	036	He answered, “Who is He, sir, that I may believe in Him?”
043	JOH	009	037	Jesus told him, “You have seen Him, and it is He who is talking with you.”
043	JOH	009	038	Then he said, “Lord, I believe!” and he worshipped Jesus.
043	JOH	009	039	Jesus said, “I came into this world for judgment, so that those who don’t see may see, and those who do see may become blind.”
043	JOH	009	040	Some of the Pharisees who were with Him heard these things, and asked Him, “We aren’t blind too, are we?”
043	JOH	009	041	Jesus told them, “If you were blind, you would have no sin, but since you say, ‘We see,’ your sin remains.
043	JOH	010	001	“Most assuredly, I tell you, whoever doesn’t enter the sheepfold by the door, but climbs in some other way, is a thief and a robber.
043	JOH	010	002	The one who enters by the gate is the sheep’s shepherd.
043	JOH	010	003	The gatekeeper opens the gate for him, and the sheep hear his voice. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.
043	JOH	010	004	When he brings out his own sheep, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him, because they know his voice.
043	JOH	010	005	There is no way that they will follow a stranger, but will run away from the stranger, because they don’t know the voice of strangers.”
043	JOH	010	006	Jesus used this illustration, but the Pharisees didn’t understand what He was telling them.
043	JOH	010	007	Then Jesus told them again, “Most assuredly, I tell you, I am the sheep’s door.
043	JOH	010	008	All who ever came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep didn’t listen to them.
043	JOH	010	009	I am the door. Anyone who enters by me will be saved, and will go in and out and find pasture.
043	JOH	010	010	The thief comes only to steal, and kill, and destroy. I came that they might have life, and that they might have it in all its fullness.
043	JOH	010	011	I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep.
043	JOH	010	012	The hired hand, who isn’t the shepherd and doesn’t own the sheep, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and runs away. So, the wolf snatches them and scatters them.
043	JOH	010	013	The hired hand is concerned about the wages, and not the sheep, so the hired hand runs away.
043	JOH	010	014	I am the good shepherd. I know my own and my own know me,
043	JOH	010	015	just as the Father knows me and I know the Father. I lay down my life for the sheep.
043	JOH	010	016	I have other sheep that don’t belong to this fold. I must bring them also, and they will listen to my voice. So, there will be one flock, with one shepherd.
043	JOH	010	017	For this reason the Father sincerely loves me, because I lay down my life, so that I may take it up again.
043	JOH	010	018	No one takes it away from me, but I lay it down of my own free will. I have the authority to lay it down, and I have the authority to take it up again. I received this commandment from my Father.”
043	JOH	010	019	The Jews were divided again, because of these words.
043	JOH	010	020	Many of them were saying, “He has a demon and is insane. Why do you listen to Him?”
043	JOH	010	021	Others were saying, “These aren’t the sayings of a demon-possessed person. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?”
043	JOH	010	022	At that time the Feast of Dedication took place in Jerusalem. It was winter,
043	JOH	010	023	and Jesus was walking in the temple, in Solomon’s porch.
043	JOH	010	024	Then the Jews gathered around Him, and asked Him, “How long will You keep us in suspense? If You are the Christ, tell us plainly.”
043	JOH	010	025	Jesus answered, “I told you, but you don’t believe. The works that I do in my Father’s name testify about me,
043	JOH	010	026	but you don’t believe, because you aren’t of my sheep.
043	JOH	010	027	My sheep listen to my voice. I know them, and they follow me.
043	JOH	010	028	I give them eternal life, and they will never perish. No one is able to snatch them out of my hand.
043	JOH	010	029	My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all; and no one is able to snatch them out of my Father’s hand.
043	JOH	010	030	I and my Father are one.”
043	JOH	010	031	Therefore the Jews took up stones again to stone Him.
043	JOH	010	032	Jesus answered, “I showed you many good works from the Father. For which of them are you stoning me?”
043	JOH	010	033	The Jews answered Him, “We aren’t stoning you for a good work, but for blasphemy, because You, being a man, claim to be God.”
043	JOH	010	034	Jesus answered, “Isn’t it written in your Law, ‘I said, “You are gods”’?
043	JOH	010	035	If he, who God’s word came to, called them gods, (and the Scripture can’t be broken),
043	JOH	010	036	do you say of Him who the Father set apart and sent into the world, ‘You are blaspheming,’ because I said, ‘I am God’s Son’?
043	JOH	010	037	If I don’t do my Father’s works, then don’t believe me.
043	JOH	010	038	But if I do them, even if you don’t believe me, believe the works, so that you may know and understand that the Father is in me, and I am in the Father.”
043	JOH	010	039	Therefore they were trying again to seize Him, and He escaped from their grasp.
043	JOH	010	040	Jesus went away again across the Jordan to the place where John was first baptizing, and He was staying there.
043	JOH	010	041	Many came to Him and were saying, “John performed no miraculous sign, but everything that John said about this man was true.”
043	JOH	010	042	Many believed in Jesus there.
043	JOH	011	001	Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus from Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha.
043	JOH	011	002	It was the Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped His feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.
043	JOH	011	003	These sisters therefore sent to Him, saying, “Lord, one You love is sick!”
043	JOH	011	004	When Jesus heard this, He said, “This sickness won’t end in death, but for God’s glory, so that God’s Son may be glorified by it.”
043	JOH	011	005	Now Jesus sincerely loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.
043	JOH	011	006	Yet, when He heard that Lazarus was sick, Jesus stayed where He was for two more days.
043	JOH	011	007	After this, He said to the disciples, “Let’s go back to Judea.”
043	JOH	011	008	The disciples said to Him, “Rabbi, the Jews were just recently trying to stone You! Are You really going back there?”
043	JOH	011	009	Jesus answered, “Aren’t there twelve hours of daylight? Anyone who walks by day doesn’t stumble, because he sees the light of this world.
043	JOH	011	010	But anyone who walks by night stumbles, because the light isn’t in him.”
043	JOH	011	011	After He had said this, He told them, “Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I am going there to wake him up.”
043	JOH	011	012	The disciples therefore said to Him, “Lord, if he is sleeping, he will recover.”
043	JOH	011	013	Now Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that He was talking about literal sleep.
043	JOH	011	014	So Jesus told them plainly, “Lazarus is dead,
043	JOH	011	015	and I am glad for your sakes that I wasn’t there, so that you may believe — but let’s go to him.”
043	JOH	011	016	Therefore Thomas, who is called the Twin, said to his fellow disciples, “Let’s go, too, that we may die with Him.”
043	JOH	011	017	When Jesus arrived, he found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb four days.
043	JOH	011	018	Bethany was near Jerusalem, about fifteen stadia away,
043	JOH	011	019	and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.
043	JOH	011	020	When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went out to meet him, but Mary stayed home.
043	JOH	011	021	Then Martha said to Jesus, “Lord, if You had been here, my brother wouldn’t have died.
043	JOH	011	022	Even now I know that God will give you whatever You ask of Him.”
043	JOH	011	023	Jesus told her, “Your brother will rise again.”
043	JOH	011	024	Martha replied, “I know that he will rise again in the resurrection on the last day.”
043	JOH	011	025	Jesus told her, “I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in me will live even if they die,
043	JOH	011	026	and everyone who lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?”
043	JOH	011	027	“Yes, Lord,” she answered, “I have believed that You are the Christ, God’s Son, who was to come into the world.”
043	JOH	011	028	When she had said this, she went back and called Mary, her sister, saying secretly, “The Teacher is here, and is asking for you.”
043	JOH	011	029	When she heard this, she arose quickly, and went to Him.
043	JOH	011	030	Jesus had not yet entered the village, but was still at the place where Martha met Him.
043	JOH	011	031	The Jews who were with her in the house, consoling her, saw Mary get up quickly and go out. They followed her, saying, “She is going to the tomb to weep there.”
043	JOH	011	032	When Mary came to where Jesus was, she saw Him, and fell at His feet, saying to Him, “Lord, if You had been here, my brother wouldn’t have died.”
043	JOH	011	033	When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who came with her weeping, He groaned in the spirit and was troubled.
043	JOH	011	034	He asked, “Where have you laid him?” They replied, “Lord, come and see.”
043	JOH	011	035	Jesus wept.
043	JOH	011	036	So the Jews were saying, “See how He loved him!”
043	JOH	011	037	But some of them said, “Couldn’t this man, who opened the eyes of the blind man, have kept this man from dying?”
043	JOH	011	038	Then Jesus, again groaning in Himself, came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a boulder was placed against the entrance.
043	JOH	011	039	Jesus said, “Take away the boulder.” Martha, the dead man’s sister, said to Him, “Lord, by this time there is a stench, because he has been dead four days.”
043	JOH	011	040	Jesus told her, “Didn’t I tell you that if you would believe you would see God’s glory?”
043	JOH	011	041	Then they took the boulder away from the place where the dead man was lying. Jesus lifted up His eyes and said, “Father, I thank You that You have heard me.
043	JOH	011	042	I know that You always hear me, but because of the people who are standing here I said this, that they may believe that You sent me.”
043	JOH	011	043	Now when He had said these things, He called loudly, “Lazarus, come out!”
043	JOH	011	044	He who had died came out, bound hand and foot with wrappings, and his face was wrapped around with a cloth. Jesus told them, “Unbind him, and let him go.”
043	JOH	011	045	Then many of the Jews who had come to Mary, and had seen the things Jesus did, believed in Him.
043	JOH	011	046	But some of them went away to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus did.
043	JOH	011	047	Then the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered a council and said, “What are we doing? For this Man performs many signs.
043	JOH	011	048	If we let Him go on like this, everyone will believe in Him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.”
043	JOH	011	049	Then a certain one of them, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, told them, “You don’t know anything,
043	JOH	011	050	nor do you take into account that it’s better for you that one man should die for the people, than for the whole nation to perish.”
043	JOH	011	051	He didn’t say this on his own initiative; but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus was going to die for the nation,
043	JOH	011	052	and not for the nation only, but that Jesus might also gather together into one God’s children who are scattered abroad.
043	JOH	011	053	So from that day on, they planned together to kill Jesus.
043	JOH	011	054	Therefore Jesus stopped walking publicly among the Jews, but went away from there to the region near the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there He stayed with the disciples.
043	JOH	011	055	Now the Passover of the Jews was near, and many went from the country up to Jerusalem before the Passover, to purify themselves.
043	JOH	011	056	Then they were looking for Jesus, and spoke among themselves as they stood in the temple, “What do you think? Isn’t He coming to the feast at all?”
043	JOH	011	057	Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a command, that anyone who knew where Jesus was should report it, that they might arrest Him.
043	JOH	012	001	Six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus was who had been dead, who He had raised from the dead.
043	JOH	012	002	There they made Him a supper, and Martha served, but Lazarus was one of those reclining at the table with Him.
043	JOH	012	003	Then Mary took a pound of very costly perfume of pure nard, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped His feet with her hair. The house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume.
043	JOH	012	004	Then one of Jesus’ disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son, who was about to betray Him, said,
043	JOH	012	005	“Why wasn’t this fragrant oil sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?”
043	JOH	012	006	Now he said this, not because he was concerned about the poor, but because he was a thief, and since he had the money box, he used to steal from what was put into it.
043	JOH	012	007	Jesus therefore said, “Leave her alone. She has kept this for the day of my burial.
043	JOH	012	008	You will always have the poor among you, but you won’t always have me.”
043	JOH	012	009	Then a great multitude of the Jews learned that He was there; and they came, not just for Jesus’ sake, but also so that they could see Lazarus, who He had raised from the dead.
043	JOH	012	010	So the chief priests plotted to kill Lazarus too,
043	JOH	012	011	because on account of him many of the Jews were going away, and were believing in Jesus.
043	JOH	012	012	The next day, when a great multitude that had come to the feast heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,
043	JOH	012	013	they took branches of palm trees and went out to meet Him, and shouted: “Hosanna! ‘Blessed is He who comes in the name of the LORD!’ The King of Israel!”
043	JOH	012	014	Then Jesus, finding a young donkey, sat on it, as it is written:
043	JOH	012	015	“Don’t be afraid, Daughter of Zion; look, your king is coming, sitting on a donkey’s colt.”
043	JOH	012	016	His disciples didn’t understand these things at first, but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written about Him and that they had done these things to Him.
043	JOH	012	017	So the crowd that had been with Him when He called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to testify.
043	JOH	012	018	The crowd also met Him because they heard that He had done this sign.
043	JOH	012	019	Then the Pharisees said among themselves, “You see that you are accomplishing nothing. Look, the whole world has gone after Him!”
043	JOH	012	020	Now there were certain Greeks among those who came up to worship at the feast.
043	JOH	012	021	Then they came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and told him, “Sir, we would like to see Jesus.”
043	JOH	012	022	Philip came and told Andrew, then Andrew and Philip came and told Jesus.
043	JOH	012	023	Jesus answered them, saying, “The time has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.
043	JOH	012	024	Most assuredly, I tell you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains alone, but if it dies, it produces many grains.
043	JOH	012	025	Anyone who loves their life will lose it, and anyone who hates their life in this world will keep it for eternal life.
043	JOH	012	026	If anyone serves me, let them follow me; and where I am, there my servant will be also. If anyone serves me, my Father will honor them.
043	JOH	012	027	“Now my soul has become troubled; and what will I say? ‘Father, save me from this time’? No, for this purpose I came to this time.
043	JOH	012	028	Father, glorify Your name.” Then a voice came from Heaven, saying, “I have both glorified it and will glorify it again.”
043	JOH	012	029	Therefore the people who stood by and heard it said that it had thundered. Others said, “An angel has spoken to Him.”
043	JOH	012	030	Jesus answered, “This voice hasn’t come for my sake, but for your sakes.
043	JOH	012	031	Now judgment is upon this world. Now the ruler of this world will be cast out.
043	JOH	012	032	And I, if I am lifted up from the Earth, will draw everyone to myself.”
043	JOH	012	033	He was saying this to indicate the kind of death He was about to die.
043	JOH	012	034	Therefore the crowd answered Him, “We have heard from the Law that the Christ is to remain forever, so how can You say, ‘The Son of Man must be lifted up’? Who is this Son of Man?”
043	JOH	012	035	Jesus told them, “The light is with you for a little longer. Walk while you have the light, so that the darkness may not overtake you. If you walk in the darkness, you don’t know where you are going.
043	JOH	012	036	Believe in the light while you have the light, so that you may become children of light.” After Jesus had said this, he departed and hid from them.
043	JOH	012	037	Although He had performed so many signs in front of them, they still didn’t believe in Him,
043	JOH	012	038	so that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke: “Lord, who has believed our report? And who has the arm of the LORD been revealed to?”
043	JOH	012	039	Therefore they couldn’t believe, because Isaiah said again:
043	JOH	012	040	“He has blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts, lest they see with their eyes, and understand with their hearts and turn — and I would heal them.”
043	JOH	012	041	Isaiah said this because he saw Jesus’ glory and spoke about Him.
043	JOH	012	042	Nevertheless, even many of the rulers believed in Him, but because of the Pharisees they weren’t confessing Him, for fear that they might be put out of the synagogue;
043	JOH	012	043	because they sincerely loved men’s approval more than God’s approval.
043	JOH	012	044	Jesus cried out and said, “Whoever believes in me doesn’t just believe in me, but in Him who sent me.
043	JOH	012	045	Whoever sees me sees Him who sent me.
043	JOH	012	046	I have come into the world as light, that everyone who believes in me should not stay in darkness.
043	JOH	012	047	If anyone hears the words I speak, and doesn’t keep them, I don’t judge them; because I didn’t come to judge the world, but to save the world.
043	JOH	012	048	Whoever rejects me, and doesn’t receive my sayings, has one who judges them. The words that I spoke are what will judge him at the last day.
043	JOH	012	049	For I haven’t spoken on my own initiative, but the Father Himself who sent me has given me commandment, what to say, and what to speak.
043	JOH	012	050	I know that His commandment is eternal life, so the things I speak, I speak just as the Father has told me.”
043	JOH	013	001	Before the Feast of the Passover, Jesus knew that His time had come that He should depart out of this world to the Father. Having sincerely loved His own who were in the world, He sincerely loved them to the end.
043	JOH	013	002	Supper was finished, and the Devil had already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son, to betray Jesus.
043	JOH	013	003	Jesus, knowing that the Father had given everything into His hands, and that He had come from God and was going to God,
043	JOH	013	004	got up from supper, laid aside His outer garment, and wrapped a towel around His waist.
043	JOH	013	005	Then He poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples’ feet, and to wipe them with the towel that was wrapped around Him.
043	JOH	013	006	Then He came to Simon Peter, and Peter asked Him, “Lord, are You washing my feet?”
043	JOH	013	007	Jesus answered, “You don’t understand what I am doing now, but you will know after this.”
043	JOH	013	008	Peter told Him, “You will never wash my feet!” Jesus answered, “If I don’t wash you, you have no part with me.”
043	JOH	013	009	Simon Peter said to Him, “Lord, not just my feet, but also my hands and my head!”
043	JOH	013	010	Jesus said to him, “Someone who has bathed only needs to wash their feet, but is completely clean; and most of you are clean, but not all of you.”
043	JOH	013	011	For He knew who would betray Him, therefore He said, “You aren’t all clean.”
043	JOH	013	012	When He had washed their feet, He put on His outer garment and sat down again. He asked them, “Do you know what I have done to you?
043	JOH	013	013	You call me Teacher and Lord, and you are right in saying so, for so I am.
043	JOH	013	014	If I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet.
043	JOH	013	015	I have given you an example, that you should also do as I have done to you.
043	JOH	013	016	Most assuredly, I tell you, a servant isn’t greater than his master, nor is he who is sent greater than he who sent him.
043	JOH	013	017	If you know these things, you are blessed if you do them.
043	JOH	013	018	I’m not talking about all of you. I know who I have chosen; but this is to fulfill the Scripture, ‘He who eats bread with me has lifted up his heel against me.’
043	JOH	013	019	Now I tell you before it happens, that when it does happen, you may believe that I AM.
043	JOH	013	020	Most assuredly, I tell you, whoever receives anyone I send receives me; and he who receives me receives Him who sent me.”
043	JOH	013	021	When Jesus had said these things, He was troubled in spirit, and testified and said, “Most assuredly, I tell you, one of you will betray me.”
043	JOH	013	022	The disciples began looking at one another, perplexed about which one of them He was talking about.
043	JOH	013	023	One of Jesus’ disciples, who Jesus sincerely loved, was leaning against His breast.
043	JOH	013	024	Simon Peter therefore nodded to him to ask who He spoke about.
043	JOH	013	025	Then, leaning back on Jesus’ breast, he asked Him, “Lord, who is it?”
043	JOH	013	026	Jesus answered, “It is he who I will give a morsel to when I have dipped it.” Having dipped the morsel, He gave it to Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son.
043	JOH	013	027	After the morsel, Satan entered into him. Jesus therefore told him, “What you do, do quickly.”
043	JOH	013	028	None of those reclining at the table knew why He had said this to him.
043	JOH	013	029	Some were supposing, because Judas had the money box, that Jesus was saying to him, “Buy the things we need for the feast”; or else, that he should give something to the poor.
043	JOH	013	030	Having received the morsel, he went out immediately. It was night.
043	JOH	013	031	When he had gone out, Jesus said, “Now the Son of Man is glorified, and God is glorified in Him.
043	JOH	013	032	If God is glorified in Him, God will also glorify Him in Himself, and will glorify Him immediately.
043	JOH	013	033	Little children, I am with you a little while longer. You will look for me, and as I told the Jews, I now tell you, also, ‘Where I am going, you can’t come.’
043	JOH	013	034	I give to you a new commandment, that you sincerely love one another, even as I have sincerely loved you, so you should also sincerely love one another.
043	JOH	013	035	By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you have sincere love for one another.”
043	JOH	013	036	Simon Peter asked Him, “Lord, where are You going?” Jesus answered, “Where I go, you aren’t able to follow me now, but you will follow later.”
043	JOH	013	037	Peter asked Him, “Lord, why can’t I follow You right now? I will lay down my life for You.”
043	JOH	013	038	Jesus answered, “Will you lay down your life for my sake? Most assuredly, I tell you, the rooster won’t crow until you have denied me three times.
043	JOH	014	001	“Don’t let your heart be troubled. You believe in God, believe also in me.
043	JOH	014	002	In my Father’s house are many mansions. If it weren’t so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you,
043	JOH	014	003	and if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to myself; that where I am, there you may also be.
043	JOH	014	004	You know where I go, and you know the way.”
043	JOH	014	005	Thomas asked Him, “Lord, we don’t know where You are going, so how can we know the way?”
043	JOH	014	006	Jesus told him, “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.
043	JOH	014	007	If you had known me, you would have known my Father too. From now on you know Him and have seen Him.”
043	JOH	014	008	Philip said to Him, “Lord, show us the Father, and that would be enough for us.”
043	JOH	014	009	Jesus answered, “Have I been with you so long, and yet you haven’t known me, Philip? Whoever has seen me has seen the Father, so how can you say, ‘Show us the Father’?
043	JOH	014	010	Don’t you believe that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? The words that I speak to you aren’t my own, but from the Father who lives in me. He does the works.
043	JOH	014	011	Believe me when I say that I am in the Father and the Father in me, or else believe me for the sake of the works themselves.
043	JOH	014	012	“Most assuredly, I tell you, whoever believes in me will also do the works that I do, and even greater works than these, because I am going to my Father.
043	JOH	014	013	I will do whatever you ask in my name, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.
043	JOH	014	014	If you ask anything in my name, I will do it.
043	JOH	014	015	If you sincerely love me, you will keep my commandments.
043	JOH	014	016	I will then ask the Father, and He will give you another Counselor, that He may be with you forever —
043	JOH	014	017	the Spirit of truth, whom the world can’t receive, because it neither sees Him nor knows Him. You know Him, though, because He lives with you and will be in you.
043	JOH	014	018	I won’t leave you orphans. I will come to you.
043	JOH	014	019	After a little while the world won’t see me, but you will see me. Because I live, you will also live.
043	JOH	014	020	In that day you will know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you.
043	JOH	014	021	Whoever has my commandments and keeps them, sincerely loves me. Whoever sincerely loves me will be sincerely loved by my Father, and I’ll sincerely love them and reveal myself to them.”
043	JOH	014	022	Judas (not Iscariot) asked Him, “Lord, how is it that You will reveal Yourself to us, and not to the world?”
043	JOH	014	023	Jesus answered him, “If anyone sincerely loves me, that person will keep my words; and my Father will sincerely love that person, and we will come and make our home with that person.
043	JOH	014	024	Whoever doesn’t sincerely love me doesn’t keep my words. The word which you hear isn’t mine, but the Father’s who sent me.
043	JOH	014	025	“I’ve told you these things while living with you,
043	JOH	014	026	but the Counselor, the Holy Spirit, who the Father will send in my name, will teach you everything, and bring to your remembrance all that I told you.
043	JOH	014	027	I leave peace with you. I give you my peace. I don’t give to you as the world gives. Don’t let your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.
043	JOH	014	028	You have heard me tell you, ‘I am going away and coming back to you.’ If you sincerely loved me, you would rejoice because I said, ‘I am going to the Father,’ for my Father is greater than I.
043	JOH	014	029	Now I have told you before it happens, that when it does happen, you may believe.
043	JOH	014	030	I won’t talk much longer with you, for the ruler of this world is coming. He has no power over me,
043	JOH	014	031	but the world must learn that I sincerely love the Father and that I do exactly what my Father has commanded me. “Come on. Let’s go.
043	JOH	015	001	“I am the true vine, and my Father is the gardener.
043	JOH	015	002	He takes away every branch in me that doesn’t bear fruit, and He prunes every branch that bears fruit, so that it may bear more fruit.
043	JOH	015	003	You are already pruned clean because of the words which I have spoken to you.
043	JOH	015	004	Live in me, as I live in you. As the branch can’t bear fruit of itself, unless it lives in the vine, so neither can you, unless you live in me.
043	JOH	015	005	I am the vine, and you are the branches. Whoever lives in me, and I in them, bears much fruit; for apart from me you can do nothing.
043	JOH	015	006	Anyone who doesn’t live in me is thrown away as a branch, and dries up. The dried up branches are gathered up, thrown into the fire, and burned.
043	JOH	015	007	If you live in me, and my words live in you, ask whatever you want, and it will be done for you.
043	JOH	015	008	My Father is glorified by this, that you bear much fruit, so you will prove to be my disciples.
043	JOH	015	009	“Just as the Father has sincerely loved me, I have also sincerely loved you. Continue to live in my sincere love.
043	JOH	015	010	If you keep my commandments, you will continue to live in my sincere love; just as I have kept my Father’s commandments, and continue to live in His sincere love.
043	JOH	015	011	I have told you these things, that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be made full.
043	JOH	015	012	This is my commandment, that you sincerely love one another, just as I have sincerely loved you.
043	JOH	015	013	No one has greater sincere love than this, than to lay down one’s life for one’s friends.
043	JOH	015	014	You are my friends if you do whatever I command you.
043	JOH	015	015	I don’t call you servants any longer, because a servant doesn’t know what the master is doing; but I have called you friends, because I have made known to you everything that I have heard from my Father.
043	JOH	015	016	You didn’t choose me, but I chose you and appointed you, so that you should go and bear fruit, and so that your fruit should remain, that whatever you ask the Father in my name He may give you.
043	JOH	015	017	I command you this, that you sincerely love one another.
043	JOH	015	018	“If the world hates you, know that it hated me before it hated you.
043	JOH	015	019	If you belonged to the world, the world would love its own. Because you aren’t the world’s, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.
043	JOH	015	020	Remember that I told you, ‘A servant isn’t greater than his master.’ If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you. If they obeyed my teaching, they will also obey yours.
043	JOH	015	021	The world will do all these things to you, however, for My name’s sake, because they don’t know Him who sent me.
043	JOH	015	022	If I hadn’t come and spoken to them, they would have no sin, but now they have no excuse for their sin.
043	JOH	015	023	Whoever hates me also hates my Father.
043	JOH	015	024	If I hadn’t done the works which no one else did among them, they would have no sin; but now they have seen and also hated both me and my Father.
043	JOH	015	025	This was to fulfill the word that is written in their Law, ‘They hated me without a cause.’
043	JOH	015	026	When the Counselor comes, who I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of Truth who proceeds from the Father, He will testify of me.
043	JOH	015	027	You will also testify, because you have been with me from the beginning.
043	JOH	016	001	“I have told you these things so that you may be kept from stumbling.
043	JOH	016	002	They will put you out of the synagogues. Indeed, the time is coming that whoever kills you will think that they are serving God.
043	JOH	016	003	They will do these things to you because they haven’t known the Father nor me.
043	JOH	016	004	I have told you these things, so that when the time comes, you may remember that I told you about them. I didn’t tell you these things at the beginning, because I was with you.
043	JOH	016	005	“Now I am going to Him who sent me, yet none of you asks me, ‘Where are you going?’
043	JOH	016	006	Instead, because I have told you these things, sorrow has filled your heart.
043	JOH	016	007	Nevertheless, I tell you the truth: it’s to your advantage that I go away; because if I don’t go away, the Counselor won’t come to you; but if I go, I will send Him to you.
043	JOH	016	008	When He has come, He will convict the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:
043	JOH	016	009	of sin, because they don’t believe in me;
043	JOH	016	010	of righteousness, because I go to my Father and you see me no more;
043	JOH	016	011	and of judgment, because the ruler of this world is judged.
043	JOH	016	012	“I still have many things to tell you, but you can’t bear them now.
043	JOH	016	013	However, when the Spirit of truth has come, He will guide you into all truth. He won’t speak on His own, but whatever He hears He will speak. He will announce things to come.
043	JOH	016	014	He will glorify me, because He will take from what is mine and reveal it to you.
043	JOH	016	015	Everything that the Father has is mine. That is why I said that He will take from what is mine and reveal it to you.
043	JOH	016	016	“In a little while, you won’t see me; and in a little while longer, you will see me again, because I go to the Father.”
043	JOH	016	017	Then some of Jesus’ disciples said among themselves, “What does He mean by, ‘In a little while, and you won’t see me; and in a little while longer, you will see me, again;’ and, ‘because I go to the Father’?”
043	JOH	016	018	They kept asking, “What does He mean by ‘a little while’? We don’t understand what He is saying.”
043	JOH	016	019	Now Jesus knew that they wanted to ask Him, and He said to them, “Are you asking yourselves about what I said, ‘In a little while, and you won’t see me; and in a little while longer, you will see me, again’?
043	JOH	016	020	Most assuredly, I tell you that you will weep and mourn, but the world will rejoice. You will be sad, but your sadness will be turned into joy.
043	JOH	016	021	A woman in labor is in pain because her time has come; but as soon as she has given birth to the baby, she forgets the agony, for joy that a child has been born into the world.
043	JOH	016	022	Therefore you have sorrow now, too, but I will see you again, and your heart will rejoice, and nobody will take your joy away from you.
043	JOH	016	023	“In that day you will ask me nothing. Most assuredly, I tell you, whatever you ask the Father in My name He will give you.
043	JOH	016	024	Until now you have asked nothing in my name. Ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be full.
043	JOH	016	025	“I’ve told you these things in figures of speech, but the time is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figures of speech, but I will tell you plainly about the Father.
043	JOH	016	026	In that day you will ask in my name. I don’t tell you that I’ll ask the Father for you,
043	JOH	016	027	because the Father Himself loves you, because you have loved me, and have believed that I came forth from God.
043	JOH	016	028	I came forth from the Father and have come into the world. Again, I am leaving the world and going to the Father.”
043	JOH	016	029	His disciples said to Him, “See, now You are speaking plainly, and not in figures of speech!
043	JOH	016	030	Now we are sure that You know everything, and don’t need anyone to question You. By this we believe that You came forth from God.”
043	JOH	016	031	Jesus answered them, “Do you now believe?
043	JOH	016	032	The time is coming, and indeed, has now come, that you will be scattered, each to his own home, and you will leave me all alone. Yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.
043	JOH	016	033	I have told you these things so that you may have peace in me. You will have trouble in the world, but cheer up! I have overcome the world.”
043	JOH	017	001	After Jesus said these things, He looked toward Heaven, and said: “Father, the time has come. Glorify Your Son, so that Your Son may also glorify You,
043	JOH	017	002	as You have given Him authority over all flesh, that He should give eternal life to as many as You have given Him.
043	JOH	017	003	This is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ who You have sent.
043	JOH	017	004	I have glorified You on the Earth. I have finished the work which You have given me to do.
043	JOH	017	005	Now, O Father, glorify me together with Yourself, with the glory which I had with You before the world existed.
043	JOH	017	006	“I have revealed Your name to the people You’ve given me out of the world. They were Yours. You gave them to me, and they have kept Your word.
043	JOH	017	007	Now they know that everything You’ve given me comes from You,
043	JOH	017	008	for I have spoken to them the words You’ve given me. They have received Your words, and have come to know for certain that I came forth from You. They have believed that You sent me.
043	JOH	017	009	It is for them I pray. I’m not praying for the world, but for those who You’ve given me, because they belong to You.
043	JOH	017	010	All of mine are Yours, and Yours are mine. I am glorified in them.
043	JOH	017	011	Now I am no longer in the world, but these are in the world. I am coming to You. Holy Father, keep through Your name those who You’ve given me, that they may be one just as we are one.
043	JOH	017	012	I kept them in Your name while I was with them in the world. I have kept the people You gave me; and none of them is lost except the son of perdition, so that the Scripture might be fulfilled.
043	JOH	017	013	Now I am coming to You, and I speak these things in the world, so that they may have my joy fulfilled in themselves.
043	JOH	017	014	I have given them Your word. The world has hated them because they don’t belong to the world, just as I don’t belong to the world.
043	JOH	017	015	I don’t pray that You should take them out of the world, but that You should keep them from the evil one.
043	JOH	017	016	They don’t belong to the world, just as I don’t belong to the world.
043	JOH	017	017	Sanctify them by Your truth. Your word is truth.
043	JOH	017	018	As You sent me into the world, I have sent them into the world.
043	JOH	017	019	I sanctify myself for their sakes, so that they may also be sanctified by the truth.
043	JOH	017	020	“I don’t pray for these alone, but also for those who will believe in me through their message,
043	JOH	017	021	that they all may be one, as You, Father, are in me, and I in You. I pray that they also may be one in Us, so that the world may believe that You sent me.
043	JOH	017	022	I have given them the glory which You gave me, that they may be one just as we are one:
043	JOH	017	023	I in them and You in me. May they be brought to complete unity to let the world know that You sent me and have sincerely loved them even as You have sincerely loved me.
043	JOH	017	024	Father, I desire that those You gave me may also be with me where I am, that they may see my glory which You’ve given me; because You sincerely loved me before the foundation of the world.
043	JOH	017	025	O righteous Father! The world hasn’t known You, but I have always known You, and these have come to know that You sent me.
043	JOH	017	026	I have declared to them Your name, and will continue to declare it, so that the sincere love with which You sincerely loved me may be in them, and I may be in them.”
043	JOH	018	001	When Jesus had said these things, He went with His disciples across the Kidron ravine, where there was a garden, into which He and His disciples entered.
043	JOH	018	002	Now Judas, who was betraying Him, also knew the place, because Jesus had often met there with His disciples.
043	JOH	018	003	Then Judas, leading a detachment of soldiers and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, came there with lanterns, torches, and weapons.
043	JOH	018	004	Therefore Jesus, knowing everything that would happen to Him, went forward and asked them, “Who are you looking for?”
043	JOH	018	005	They answered, “Jesus of Nazareth.” Jesus told them, “I AM.” Judas, who betrayed Him, also stood with them.
043	JOH	018	006	Now when He told them, “I AM,” they drew back and fell to the ground.
043	JOH	018	007	Then He asked them again, “Who are you looking for?” They said, “Jesus of Nazareth.”
043	JOH	018	008	Jesus answered, “I told you that I AM. So, if you are looking for me, let these go their way,”
043	JOH	018	009	that the saying might be fulfilled which He spoke, “I have lost none of those who You gave me.”
043	JOH	018	010	Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it and struck the high priest’s servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant’s name was Malchus.
043	JOH	018	011	So Jesus told Peter, “Put your sword into its sheath! Shouldn’t I drink the cup that my Father has given me?”
043	JOH	018	012	Then the detachment of soldiers and their commander and the officers of the Jews arrested Jesus and tied Him up.
043	JOH	018	013	They led Him away to Annas first, because he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.
043	JOH	018	014	It was Caiaphas who advised the Jews that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.
043	JOH	018	015	Simon Peter was following Jesus, and so was another disciple. Since the high priest knew that disciple, he entered with Jesus into the high priest’s court,
043	JOH	018	016	but Peter was standing just outside the door. So the other disciple, who the high priest knew, went out and spoke to the woman who guarded the door, and brought Peter in.
043	JOH	018	017	Then the maidservant who kept the door asked Peter, “You aren’t one of this man’s disciples, too, are you?” He said, “I am not.”
043	JOH	018	018	Because it was cold, the servants and the officers were standing there warming themselves, having made a charcoal fire. Peter was also with them, standing and warming himself.
043	JOH	018	019	Then the high priest asked Jesus about His disciples and His doctrine.
043	JOH	018	020	Jesus answered him, “I have spoken openly to the world. I always taught in synagogues, and in the temple, where all the Jews come together. I said nothing in secret.
043	JOH	018	021	Why do you ask me? Ask those who have heard me to tell you what I told them. They certainly know what I said.”
043	JOH	018	022	When He had said these things, one of the officers who stood by hit Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, “Is that how you answer the high priest?”
043	JOH	018	023	Jesus answered him, “If I have spoken evil, testify about the evil, but if I have spoken honestly, why do you hit me?”
043	JOH	018	024	Then Annas sent Him, still bound, to Caiaphas, the high priest.
043	JOH	018	025	Now Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. Therefore they asked him, “You aren’t one of His disciples, too, are you?” He denied it, saying, “I am not!”
043	JOH	018	026	One of the servants of the high priest, a relative of the man whose ear Peter cut off, said, “Didn’t I see you in the garden with Him?”
043	JOH	018	027	Peter then denied it again, and immediately a rooster crowed.
043	JOH	018	028	Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas to the Praetorium. It was early morning. They themselves didn’t go into the Praetorium, so that they wouldn’t be defiled, and so that they might eat the Passover supper.
043	JOH	018	029	So Pilate came out to them and asked, “What charges do you bring against this man?”
043	JOH	018	030	They answered, “If this man wasn’t a criminal, we wouldn’t have handed him over to you.”
043	JOH	018	031	Then Pilate told them, “You take Him and judge Him according to your Law.” Therefore the Jews said to him, “It’s illegal for us to put anyone to death.”
043	JOH	018	032	This happened so that the words would be fulfilled which Jesus had spoken indicating the kind of death he was going to die.
043	JOH	018	033	Then Pilate went back into the Praetorium, summoned Jesus, and asked Him, “Are You the King of the Jews?”
043	JOH	018	034	Jesus answered, “Are you speaking for yourself about this, or did others tell you this about me?”
043	JOH	018	035	Pilate answered, “I’m not a Jew, am I? Your own nation and the chief priests have delivered You to me. What have You done?”
043	JOH	018	036	Jesus answered, “My kingdom doesn’t belong to this world. If my kingdom did belong to this world, then my servants would be fighting to keep me from being delivered up to the Jews; but as it is, my kingdom isn’t from here.”
043	JOH	018	037	Pilate therefore asked Him, “So You are a king?” Jesus answered, “You are right in saying that I am a king. For this I have been born, and for this I have come into the world, to testify about the truth. Everyone who belongs to the truth listens to my voice.”
043	JOH	018	038	“What is truth?” Pilate asked. After asking this, he went out again to the Jews and said, “I find no basis for a charge against Him,
043	JOH	018	039	but you have a custom that I should release someone to you at the Passover. Therefore you decide: do you want me to release the King of the Jews to you?”
043	JOH	018	040	Then they all shouted back, saying, “Not this man, but Barabbas!” Now Barabbas was a robber.
043	JOH	019	001	Then Pilate took Jesus and had him flogged.
043	JOH	019	002	The soldiers twisted thorns into a crown and put it on His head, and they put a purple robe on Him.
043	JOH	019	003	They kept coming up to Him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!” and slapping Him on the face.
043	JOH	019	004	Pilate then went out again, and told the Jews, “Look, I’m bringing Him out to you, that you may know that I find no basis for a charge against Him.”
043	JOH	019	005	Then Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe, and Pilate said to them, “Look! Here is the man!”
043	JOH	019	006	When the chief priests and officers saw Him, they shouted “Crucify Him! Crucify Him!” Pilate told them, “You take Him and crucify Him, because I find no basis for a charge against Him.”
043	JOH	019	007	The Jews answered him, “We have a law, and according to our law He ought to die, because He claimed to be God’s Son.”
043	JOH	019	008	When Pilate heard this, he was even more afraid,
043	JOH	019	009	and went back into the Praetorium, and asked Jesus, “Where are You from?” But Jesus didn’t answer him.
043	JOH	019	010	Pilate therefore asked him, “Do you refuse to speak to me? Don’t you know that I have authority to release you, and authority to crucify you?”
043	JOH	019	011	Jesus answered, “You would have no authority at all against me unless it had been given you from above. Therefore the one who delivered me to you has the greater sin.”
043	JOH	019	012	From then on, Pilate tried to release Him, but the Jews shouted, “If you let this man go, you aren’t Caesar’s friend. Whoever makes himself a king speaks against Caesar.”
043	JOH	019	013	Therefore when Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus out, and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called “The Pavement,” but in Hebrew, “Gabbatha.”
043	JOH	019	014	Now it was the day of preparation for the Passover. It was about the sixth hour. Pilate told the Jews, “Look! Here is your King!”
043	JOH	019	015	They therefore shouted, “Away with Him! Away with Him! Crucify Him!” Pilate asked them, “Shall I crucify your King?” The chief priests answered, “We have no king but Caesar!”
043	JOH	019	016	Then Pilate delivered Jesus to them to be crucified. So they took Jesus and led Him away.
043	JOH	019	017	And He, bearing His cross, went out to a place called the Place of a Skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha.
043	JOH	019	018	There they crucified Him, and two others with Him, one on either side, with Jesus in the center.
043	JOH	019	019	Now Pilate wrote a notice, and put it on the cross. The notice said: “JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.”
043	JOH	019	020	Then many of the Jews read this notice, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and it was written in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin.
043	JOH	019	021	Therefore the chief priests of the Jews told Pilate, “Don’t write, ‘The King of the Jews,’ but, ‘He said, “I am the King of the Jews.”’”
043	JOH	019	022	Pilate answered, “What I have written, I have written.”
043	JOH	019	023	When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they split His garments into four parts, to each soldier a part, including the tunic. Now the tunic was without seam, woven from the top in one piece.
043	JOH	019	024	Therefore they said to one another, “Let’s not tear it, but cast lots to see whose it will be,” that the Scripture might be fulfilled which says: “They divided my garments among them, And for my clothing they cast lots.” So the soldiers did these things.
043	JOH	019	025	Now Jesus’ mother, His mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene stood by Jesus’ cross.
043	JOH	019	026	Therefore when Jesus saw His mother, and the disciple who He sincerely loved standing by, He told His mother, “Woman, here is your son!”
043	JOH	019	027	Then He told the disciple, “Here is your mother!” From that hour, that disciple took her into his own home.
043	JOH	019	028	After this, Jesus, knowing that everything was now accomplished, so that the Scripture might be fulfilled, said, “I’m thirsty!”
043	JOH	019	029	A jar full of vinegar was standing there, so they put a sponge full of the vinegar on a hyssop stalk, and lifted it up to His mouth.
043	JOH	019	030	When Jesus had received the vinegar, He said, “It is finished!” Then, He bowed His head, and gave up His spirit.
043	JOH	019	031	Because it was the Preparation Day, the Jews asked Pilate for the prisoners’ legs to be broken, and that they might be taken away, so that the bodies wouldn’t stay on the cross on the Sabbath (because that Sabbath was a special one).
043	JOH	019	032	Then the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man and of the other man who was crucified with Jesus,
043	JOH	019	033	but when they came to Jesus and saw that He was already dead, they didn’t break His legs.
043	JOH	019	034	Instead, one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out.
043	JOH	019	035	He who saw it has testified, and his testimony is true; and he knows that he is telling the truth, so that you may believe.
043	JOH	019	036	These things were done so that the Scripture should be fulfilled, “Not one of His bones shall be broken.”
043	JOH	019	037	Another Scripture says, “They will look on Him who they pierced.”
043	JOH	019	038	After this, Joseph of Arimathea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly, for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate if he could take the body of Jesus away; and Pilate gave him permission. So he came and took the body of Jesus.
043	JOH	019	039	Nicodemus, who at first came to Jesus by night, also came, bringing about a hundred Roman pounds of a mixture of myrrh and aloes.
043	JOH	019	040	So they took the body of Jesus, and wrapped it in strips of linen with the spices, as is the burial custom of the Jews.
043	JOH	019	041	In the place where He was crucified, there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one had yet been laid.
043	JOH	019	042	Because of the Jewish Preparation Day, and because the tomb was nearby, they laid Jesus there.
043	JOH	020	001	On the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene came to the tomb early, while it was still dark, and saw that the stone had been taken away from the tomb.
043	JOH	020	002	Then she ran and came to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, who Jesus loved, and told them, “They’ve taken the Lord away, out of the tomb, and we don’t know where they’ve laid Him!”
043	JOH	020	003	Then Peter and the other disciple went out, and were going to the tomb.
043	JOH	020	004	They both ran together, and the other disciple outran Peter and came to the tomb first.
043	JOH	020	005	Stooping down and looking in, He saw the strips of linen lying there, but he didn’t go in.
043	JOH	020	006	Then Simon Peter came, following him, and went into the tomb. He saw the strips of linen lying there,
043	JOH	020	007	and the handkerchief that had been around His head, not lying with the strips of linen, but folded together in a place by itself.
043	JOH	020	008	Then the other disciple, who came to the tomb first, also went in, and he saw and believed.
043	JOH	020	009	For they still didn’t know the Scripture, that Jesus must rise again from the dead.
043	JOH	020	010	Then the disciples went back to their own homes,
043	JOH	020	011	but Mary stood outside by the tomb, weeping. As she wept, she stooped down and looked into the tomb.
043	JOH	020	012	She saw two angels in white sitting where the body of Jesus had been lying, one at the head and the other at the feet.
043	JOH	020	013	Then they asked her, “Woman, why are you weeping?” She answered them, “Because they have taken away my Lord, and I don’t know where they have laid Him.”
043	JOH	020	014	Now when she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she didn’t know that it was Jesus.
043	JOH	020	015	Jesus asked her, “Woman, why are you weeping? Who are you looking for?” She, supposing Him to be the gardener, said to Him, “Sir, if You have carried Him away, tell me where You’ve laid Him, and I will take Him away.”
043	JOH	020	016	Jesus said to her, “Mary!” She turned and said to him, “Rhabbouni!” (which means Teacher).
043	JOH	020	017	Jesus said to her, “Don’t touch me, because I haven’t yet ascended to my Father; but go to my brothers and tell them, ‘I am ascending to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God.’”
043	JOH	020	018	Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that He had told her these things.
043	JOH	020	019	Then, that same first day of the week, at evening, although the doors were locked where the disciples were assembled (for fear of the Jews), Jesus came and stood in their midst. He said to them, “Peace be with you.”
043	JOH	020	020	When He had said this, He showed them His hands and His side. Then the disciples rejoiced when they saw the Lord.
043	JOH	020	021	So Jesus said to them again, “Peace be with you! As the Father has sent me, so I send you.”
043	JOH	020	022	When he had said this, he breathed on them and said to them, “Receive the Holy Spirit.
043	JOH	020	023	If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them. If you retain the sins of any, they are retained.”
043	JOH	020	024	Now Thomas, called the Twin, one of the twelve, wasn’t with them when Jesus came.
043	JOH	020	025	Therefore the other disciples were telling him, “We have seen the Lord!” But he told them, “Unless I see the imprint of the nails in His hands, put my finger into the nail prints, and put my hand into His side, I won’t believe.”
043	JOH	020	026	After eight days, His disciples were again inside, and Thomas with them. Jesus came, the doors having been locked, and stood in their midst, and said, “Peace be with you.”
043	JOH	020	027	Then He told Thomas, “Put your finger here, and see my hands. Reach your hand here, and put it into my side. Don’t be doubting, but believing.”
043	JOH	020	028	Thomas answered Him, “My Lord and my God!”
043	JOH	020	029	Jesus told him, “Thomas, you have believed because you have seen me. Blessed are those who haven’t seen, and yet have believed.”
043	JOH	020	030	Truly, Jesus also performed many other signs in the presence of the disciples, which aren’t written in this book,
043	JOH	020	031	but these have been written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, God’s Son; and so that believing you may have life in His name.
043	JOH	021	001	After these things, Jesus showed Himself to the disciples again, at the Sea of Tiberias. He showed Himself in the following way.
043	JOH	021	002	Simon Peter, Thomas called the Twin, Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two others of His disciples were together.
043	JOH	021	003	Simon Peter told them, “I’m going fishing.” They said to him, “We’ll go with you, too.” They went out immediately and got into the boat, and that night they caught nothing.
043	JOH	021	004	Now when the morning had come, Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples didn’t know that it was Jesus.
043	JOH	021	005	Therefore Jesus asked them, “Children, you don’t have any fish, do you?” “No,” they answered Him.
043	JOH	021	006	He told them, “Cast the net on the right-hand side of the boat, and you’ll find some.” So, they cast the net, and then they were unable to haul it in because of the great number of fish.
043	JOH	021	007	Therefore that disciple who Jesus sincerely loved told Peter, “It’s the Lord!” So when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put his outer garment on (for he had taken it off), and threw himself into the sea.
043	JOH	021	008	The other disciples came in the little boat, for they weren’t far from land, but about two hundred cubits away, dragging the net full of fish.
043	JOH	021	009	So when they came ashore, they saw a charcoal fire already burning, with fish and bread placed on it.
043	JOH	021	010	Jesus told them, “Bring some of the fish that you just caught.”
043	JOH	021	011	Simon Peter went up and dragged the net to land, full of one hundred fifty-three large fish. Although there were so many, the net wasn’t torn.
043	JOH	021	012	Jesus said to them, “Come and eat breakfast.” Yet none of the disciples dared ask Him, “Who are You?” They knew that it was the Lord.
043	JOH	021	013	Jesus then came and took the bread and gave it to them, and likewise the fish.
043	JOH	021	014	This is now the third time that Jesus showed Himself to His disciples after He was raised from the dead.
043	JOH	021	015	When they had eaten breakfast, Jesus asked Simon Peter, “Simon, son of Jonah, do you sincerely love me more than these?” He answered, “Yes, Lord. You know that I love You.” “Feed my lambs,” Jesus replied.
043	JOH	021	016	He asked him a second time, “Simon, son of Jonah, do you sincerely love me?” He answered, “Yes, Lord. You know that I love You.” “Shepherd my sheep,” He replied.
043	JOH	021	017	He asked the third time, “Simon, son of Jonah, do you love me?” Peter was grieved because He asked him the third time, “Do you love me?” He answered, “Lord, You know everything. You know that I love You.” “Feed My sheep,” Jesus replied.
043	JOH	021	018	“Most assuredly, I tell you, when you were younger, you dressed yourself and walked where you wanted to; but when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will dress you and carry you where you don’t want to go.”
043	JOH	021	019	He said this to indicate what kind of death he would glorify God with. When He had said this, He told Peter, “Follow me!”
043	JOH	021	020	Then Peter, turning around, saw a disciple following. This was the disciple who Jesus sincerely loved, the one who had also leaned on Jesus’ breast at the supper and asked, “Lord, who is going to betray You?”
043	JOH	021	021	Peter therefore, seeing him, asked Jesus, “Lord, what about this man?”
043	JOH	021	022	Jesus answered, “If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you? You follow me!”
043	JOH	021	023	Because of this answer, the rumor spread among the brothers that this disciple wouldn’t die, but Jesus didn’t tell him that he wouldn’t die, but only, “If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you?”
043	JOH	021	024	This is the disciple who testifies about these things, and who wrote these things. We know that his testimony is true.
043	JOH	021	025	There are also many other things that Jesus did, which if they were written one by one, I suppose that even the world itself couldn’t contain the books that would be written. Amen.

# BOOK	062	1JO	1 John	1 John
062	1JO	001	001	We declare to you that which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we watched, and our hands have touched, concerning the Word of life.
062	1JO	001	002	The life was revealed, and we have seen, and testify, and declare to you this eternal life which was with the Father and was revealed to us.
062	1JO	001	003	That which we have seen and heard we declare to you, that you may also have fellowship with us. Truly our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son, Jesus Christ.
062	1JO	001	004	We write these things to you so that your joy may be full.
062	1JO	001	005	This is the message which we have heard from Him and declare to you: that God is light and in Him is no darkness at all.
062	1JO	001	006	If we say that we have fellowship with Him, but walk in darkness, we lie and don’t do what is true.
062	1JO	001	007	But if we walk in the light, as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus Christ, His Son, cleanses us from all sin.
062	1JO	001	008	If we say that we don’t sin, we are deceiving ourselves, and the truth isn’t in us.
062	1JO	001	009	If we admit to our sins, He is faithful and with righteous justice forgives us our sins and cleanses us from all unrighteousness.
062	1JO	001	010	If we claim that we haven’t sinned, we call Him a liar, and His word isn’t in us.
062	1JO	002	001	My little children, I am writing these things to you so that you won’t sin. If anyone sins, we have an Intercessor with the Father, the righteous Jesus Christ.
062	1JO	002	002	He Himself is the atoning sacrifice for our sins; and not for ours only, but also for those of the whole world.
062	1JO	002	003	This is how we know that we have come to know Him: if we keep His commandments.
062	1JO	002	004	The one who says, “I have come to know Him,” and doesn’t keep His commandments is a liar, and the truth isn’t in him.
062	1JO	002	005	But whoever keeps His word has the sincere love of God truly perfected in him. By this we know that we are in Him:
062	1JO	002	006	whoever claims to live in Jesus ought to walk in the same way He walked.
062	1JO	002	007	Brothers and sisters, I’m not writing a new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you have had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which you have heard.
062	1JO	002	008	Yet, I am writing a new commandment to you, which is true in Him and in you, because the darkness is passing away, and the true light is already shining.
062	1JO	002	009	Whoever claims to be in the light but hates a brother or sister, is still in darkness.
062	1JO	002	010	Whoever sincerely loves his brothers and sisters lives in the light, and there is no cause for stumbling in him.
062	1JO	002	011	But whoever hates a brother or sister is in darkness and walks in darkness, and doesn’t know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.
062	1JO	002	012	I write to you, little children, because your sins are forgiven for His name’s sake.
062	1JO	002	013	I write to you, fathers, because you have known Him who is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one. I write to you, little children, because you have known the Father.
062	1JO	002	014	I have written to you, fathers, because you have known Him who is from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God lives in you, and you have overcome the wicked one.
062	1JO	002	015	Don’t sincerely love the world or the things in the world. If anyone sincerely loves the world, the sincere love of the Father isn’t in him.
062	1JO	002	016	For everything that is in the world - the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life - isn’t the Father’s, but is the world’s.
062	1JO	002	017	The world and its lusts are passing away, but whoever does the will of God stays forever.
062	1JO	002	018	Little children, we are in the end times. As you have heard the antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have come. By this we know that we are in the end times.
062	1JO	002	019	They went out from us, but they didn’t belong to us. For if they had belonged to us, they would have continued with us. Instead, they went out so that it might be revealed that none of them belonged to us.
062	1JO	002	020	But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you all know the truth.
062	1JO	002	021	I write to you, not because you don’t know the truth, but because you do know it, and because you know that no lie belongs to the truth.
062	1JO	002	022	Who is a liar? Whoever denies that Jesus is the Christ. Whoever denies the Father and the Son is an antichrist.
062	1JO	002	023	Whoever denies the Son doesn’t have the Father either. Whoever acknowledges the Son also has the Father.
062	1JO	002	024	Therefore, let that which you heard from the beginning live in you. If what you heard from the beginning lives in you, you also will live in the Son and in the Father.
062	1JO	002	025	This is the promise that He has promised to us - eternal life.
062	1JO	002	026	I have written these things to you about those who are trying to deceive you.
062	1JO	002	027	As for you, the anointing that you received from Him lives in you, and you have no need for anyone to teach you. Yet as His anointing teaches you about all things, and is true and not a lie; just as it has taught you, you live in Him.
062	1JO	002	028	Now, little children, live in Him, so that when He appears, we may have confidence and not shrink away from Him in shame at His coming.
062	1JO	002	029	If you know that He is righteous, then know that everyone who also practices righteousness is born of Him.
062	1JO	003	001	See how great a sincere love the Father has given us, that we should be called children of God! Because the world didn’t know Him, it doesn’t know us.
062	1JO	003	002	Beloved, now we are children of God, and it hasn’t yet appeared what we will be. We know that when He appears we will be like Him, because we will see Him just as He is.
062	1JO	003	003	Everyone who has this hope fixed on Him purifies himself, just as He is pure.
062	1JO	003	004	Everyone who practices sin also practices lawlessness. Sin is lawlessness.
062	1JO	003	005	You know that He appeared to take away sins. There is no sin in Him.
062	1JO	003	006	No one who lives in Him sins. No one who sins has seen Him or knows Him.
062	1JO	003	007	Little children, don’t let anybody deceive you. The one who practices righteousness is righteous, just as He is righteous.
062	1JO	003	008	The one who practices sin is the Devil’s, because the Devil has sinned from the beginning. The Son of God appeared for this purpose, that He might destroy the works of the Devil.
062	1JO	003	009	No one who is born of God practices sin, because God’s seed lives in him. He can’t continue to sin, because he is born of God.
062	1JO	003	010	By this the children of God and the children of the Devil are obvious: anyone who doesn’t practice righteousness is not God’s, and neither is anyone who doesn’t sincerely love his brother or sister.
062	1JO	003	011	For this is the message that you have heard from the beginning, that we should sincerely love one another.
062	1JO	003	012	Don’t be like Cain, who belonged to the evil one, and killed his brother. Why did he kill him? Because Cain’s deeds were evil, and his brother’s were righteous.
062	1JO	003	013	Don’t be surprised, brothers and sisters, if the world hates you.
062	1JO	003	014	We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we sincerely love our brothers and sisters. Whoever doesn’t sincerely love lives in death.
062	1JO	003	015	Whoever hates his brother or sister is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life living in him.
062	1JO	003	016	By this we know God’s sincere love, because He laid down His life for us. So we also ought to lay down our lives for our brothers and sisters.
062	1JO	003	017	If someone has this world’s goods, and sees a brother in need, and closes up his heart of compassion from him, how does God’s sincere love live in him?
062	1JO	003	018	My little children, let’s not sincerely love just in words or in language, but in deed and in truth.
062	1JO	003	019	This is how we will know that we belong to the truth, and how we will assure our hearts before Him
062	1JO	003	020	whenever our hearts condemn us; for God is greater than our hearts, and He knows all things.
062	1JO	003	021	Beloved, if our hearts don’t condemn us, we have confidence before God;
062	1JO	003	022	and we receive from Him whatever we ask, because we keep His commandments and do the things that please Him.
062	1JO	003	023	This is His commandment, that we believe in the name of His Son, Jesus Christ, and that we sincerely love one another, just as He commanded us.
062	1JO	003	024	Whoever keeps His commandments lives in Him, and He lives in that person. This is how we know that He lives in us: by the Spirit He has given us.
062	1JO	004	001	Beloved, don’t believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God; because many false prophets have gone out into the world.
062	1JO	004	002	This is how you know God’s Spirit: every spirit that acknowledges that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God.
062	1JO	004	003	Every spirit that fails to acknowledge Jesus isn’t from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming, and now it is already in the world.
062	1JO	004	004	You are from God, little children, and have overcome them, because He who is in you is greater than he who is in the world.
062	1JO	004	005	They are from the world, therefore they talk like they are from the world, and the world listens to them.
062	1JO	004	006	We are from God. Whoever knows God listens to us. Whoever is not from God does not listen to us. By this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error.
062	1JO	004	007	Beloved, let us sincerely love one another, for sincere love is from God, and everyone who sincerely loves is born of God and knows God.
062	1JO	004	008	The one who doesn’t sincerely love doesn’t know God, for God is sincere love.
062	1JO	004	009	The sincere love of God was manifested in us by this, that God has sent His only born Son into the world so that we might live through Him.
062	1JO	004	010	In this is sincere love: not that we sincerely loved God, but that He sincerely loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins.
062	1JO	004	011	Beloved, if God sincerely loved us like this, we ought to sincerely love one another, too.
062	1JO	004	012	No one has ever seen God, but if we sincerely love one another, God lives in us and His sincere love is made complete in us.
062	1JO	004	013	This is how we know that we live in Him and He in us, because He has given us of His Spirit.
062	1JO	004	014	We have seen and testify that the Father has sent the Son as Savior of the world.
062	1JO	004	015	God lives in whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, and that person lives in God.
062	1JO	004	016	We have come to know and have believed the sincere love which God has for us. God is sincere love. One who lives in sincere love lives in God, and God lives in him.
062	1JO	004	017	Sincere love has been perfected among us in this: that we may have confident boldness on the judgment day, because as He is, so are we in this world.
062	1JO	004	018	There is no fear in sincere love, but perfect, sincere love casts out fear, because fear involves punishment. But whoever fears has not been made perfect in sincere love.
062	1JO	004	019	We sincerely love, because He first sincerely loved us.
062	1JO	004	020	If someone says, “I sincerely love God,” and hates his brother or sister, he is a liar. If someone doesn’t sincerely love a brother or sister he has seen, how can he sincerely love God whom he hasn’t seen?
062	1JO	004	021	This commandment we have from Him: that whoever sincerely loves God must sincerely love his brothers and sisters, too.
062	1JO	005	001	Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God, and whoever loves the Father loves the child born of Him.
062	1JO	005	002	This is how we know that we sincerely love the children of God: by sincerely loving God and keeping His commandments.
062	1JO	005	003	For this is God’s sincere love, that we keep His commandments. His commandments aren’t burdensome,
062	1JO	005	004	for whatever is born of God overcomes the world. This is the victory that has overcome the world - our faith.
062	1JO	005	005	Who is the one who overcomes the world, but one who believes that Jesus is God’s Son?
062	1JO	005	006	This is He who came by water and blood - Jesus Christ; not only by water, but by water and blood.
062	1JO	005	007	It is the Spirit who testifies, because the Spirit is truth. For there are three that testify,
062	1JO	005	008	the Spirit, the water, and the blood; and these three are in agreement as one.
062	1JO	005	009	If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater; because this is God’s testimony which He has testified about His Son.
062	1JO	005	010	One who believes in the Son of God has the witness in himself. One who doesn’t believe God has accused Him of being a liar, because he hasn’t believed in the testimony that God has given concerning His Son.
062	1JO	005	011	This is the witness, that God has given us eternal life, and this life is in His Son.
062	1JO	005	012	Whoever has the Son has life. Whoever doesn’t have God’s Son doesn’t have life.
062	1JO	005	013	I have written these things to you who believe in the name of God’s Son, so that you may know that you have eternal life.
062	1JO	005	014	This is the confidence that we have in Him: that if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us.
062	1JO	005	015	If we know that He hears us in whatever we ask, then we know that we have the requests which we have asked from Him.
062	1JO	005	016	If you see your brother or sister committing a sin not leading to death, you should ask, and God will, for you, give life to those who commit sin not leading to death. There is a kind of sin leading to death. I don’t say that you should make requests for this.
062	1JO	005	017	All unrighteousness is sin, and there is a kind of sin that doesn’t lead to death.
062	1JO	005	018	We know that anyone who is born of God doesn’t keep sinning, but He who was born of God keeps him. The wicked one doesn’t harm or even touch him.
062	1JO	005	019	We know that we belong to God, and the whole world lies in the power of the evil one.
062	1JO	005	020	We know that God’s Son has come, and has given us understanding, so that we might know Him who is true. We are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life.
062	1JO	005	021	Little children, keep yourselves from idols.

063	2JO	001	001	The Elder, To the chosen lady and her children, whom I sincerely love in truth - and not only I, but also all those who have known the truth -
063	2JO	001	002	because of the truth which lives in us and will be with us forever:
063	2JO	001	003	Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us from God the Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and sincere love.
063	2JO	001	004	I was very glad to find some of your children walking in truth, just as we have been commanded to do by the Father.
063	2JO	001	005	Now I ask you, dear lady, not as writing to you a new commandment, but the one which we have had from the beginning, that we sincerely love one another.
063	2JO	001	006	This is sincere love: that we walk according to His commandments. This is the commandment, just as you have heard from the beginning, that you should walk in it.
063	2JO	001	007	For many deceivers have gone out into the world - those who don’t acknowledge that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh. Such a one is a deceiver and an antichrist.
063	2JO	001	008	Watch yourselves, that you might not lose what we have accomplished, but that you may get a full reward.
063	2JO	001	009	Anyone who doesn’t live in the teaching of Christ, but runs away from it, doesn’t have God. One who lives in the teaching has both the Father and the Son.
063	2JO	001	010	If anyone comes to you and doesn’t bring this teaching, don’t welcome or receive that person into your house,
063	2JO	001	011	for the one who welcomes such a person participates in that person’s evil deeds.
063	2JO	001	012	Since I have so many things to write to you, I don’t want to do so with paper and ink; but I hope to come to you and speak face to face, that our joy may be made full.
063	2JO	001	013	The children of your chosen sister greet you. Amen.

064	3JO	001	001	The Elder, To the beloved Gaius, whom I sincerely love in truth:
064	3JO	001	002	Beloved, I pray that in all ways you may prosper and be in good health, just as I know that your soul prospers.
064	3JO	001	003	For I rejoiced greatly when some brothers came and testified about the truth that is in you, as indeed you do walk in the truth.
064	3JO	001	004	I have no greater joy than to hear that my children are walking in the truth.
064	3JO	001	005	Beloved, you are acting faithfully in whatever you accomplish for the brothers and sisters, and especially when they are strangers.
064	3JO	001	006	They have testified to your sincere love before the church. You will do well to send them on their way in a manner worthy of God,
064	3JO	001	007	for they went out for the sake of the Name, accepting nothing from the heathen.
064	3JO	001	008	Therefore we ought to support such people, that we may be fellow workers with the truth.
064	3JO	001	009	I wrote to the church, but Diotrephes, who loves to be first among them, doesn’t accept what we say.
064	3JO	001	010	For this reason, if I come, I will call attention to his deeds which he does, unjustly accusing us with wicked words. Not satisfied with this, he himself doesn’t receive the brothers and sisters, either, and he forbids those who desire to do so and puts them out of the church.
064	3JO	001	011	Beloved, don’t imitate what is evil, but what is good. The one who does good belongs to God; the one who does evil hasn’t seen God.
064	3JO	001	012	Demetrius has received a good testimony from everyone, and from the truth itself. We add our testimony, and you know that our testimony is true.
064	3JO	001	013	I had many things to write to you, but I would rather not write them to you with pen and ink;
064	3JO	001	014	but I hope to see you soon, and we will speak face to face.
064	3JO	001	015	Peace be to you. The friends greet you. Greet the friends by name.
