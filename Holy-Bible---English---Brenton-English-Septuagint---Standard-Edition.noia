# BOOK	001	GEN	Genesis	Genesis
001	GEN	001	001	In the beginning God made the heaven and the earth.
001	GEN	001	002	But the earth was unsightly and unfurnished, and darkness was over the deep, and the Spirit of God moved over the water.
001	GEN	001	003	And God said, Let there be light, and there was light.
001	GEN	001	004	And God saw the light that it was good, and God divided between the light and the darkness.
001	GEN	001	005	And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night, and there was evening and there was morning, the first day.
001	GEN	001	006	And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the water, and let it be a division between water and water, and it was so.
001	GEN	001	007	And God made the firmament, and God divided between the water which was under the firmament and the water which was above the firmament.
001	GEN	001	008	And God called the firmament Heaven, and God saw that it was good, and there was evening and there was morning, the second day.
001	GEN	001	009	And God said, Let the water which is under the heaven be collected into one place, and let the dry land appear, and it was so. And the water which was under the heaven was collected into its places, and the dry land appeared.
001	GEN	001	010	And God called the dry land Earth, and the gatherings of the waters he called Seas, and God saw that it was good.
001	GEN	001	011	And God said, Let the earth bring forth the herb of grass bearing seed according to its kind and according to its likeness, and the fruit-tree bearing fruit whose seed is in it, according to its kind on the earth, and it was so.
001	GEN	001	012	And the earth brought forth the herb of grass bearing seed according to its kind and according to its likeness, and the fruit tree bearing fruit whose seed is in it, according to its kind on the earth, and God saw that it was good.
001	GEN	001	013	And there was evening and there was morning, the third day.
001	GEN	001	014	And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth, to divide between day and night, and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and for years.
001	GEN	001	015	And let them be for light in the firmament of the heaven, so as to shine upon the earth, and it was so.
001	GEN	001	016	And God made the two great lights, the greater light for regulating the day and the lesser light for regulating the night, the stars also.
001	GEN	001	017	And God placed them in the firmament of the heaven, so as to shine upon the earth,
001	GEN	001	018	and to regulate day and night, and to divide between the light and the darkness. And God saw that it was good.
001	GEN	001	019	And there was evening and there was morning, the fourth day.
001	GEN	001	020	And God said, Let the waters bring forth reptiles having life, and winged creatures flying above the earth in the firmament of heaven, and it was so.
001	GEN	001	021	And God made great whales, and every living reptile, which the waters brought forth according to their kinds, and every creature that flies with wings according to its kind, and God saw that they were good.
001	GEN	001	022	And God blessed them, saying, Increase and multiply and fill the waters in the seas, and let the creatures that fly be multiplied on the earth.
001	GEN	001	023	And there was evening and there was morning, the fifth day.
001	GEN	001	024	And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature according to its kind, quadrupeds and reptiles and wild beasts of the earth according to their kind, and it was so.
001	GEN	001	025	And God made the wild beasts of the earth according to their kind, and cattle according to their kind, and all the reptiles of the earth according to their kind, and God saw that they were good.
001	GEN	001	026	And God said, Let us make man according to our image and likeness, and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the flying creatures of heaven, and over the cattle and all the earth, and over all the reptiles that creep on the earth.
001	GEN	001	027	And God made man, according to the image of God he made him, male and female he made them.
001	GEN	001	028	And God blessed them, saying, Increase and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the seas and flying creatures of heaven, and all the cattle and all the earth, and all the reptiles that creep on the earth.
001	GEN	001	029	And God said, Behold I have given to you every seed-bearing herb sowing seed which is upon all the earth, and every tree which has in itself the fruit of seed that is sown, to you it shall be for food.
001	GEN	001	030	And to all the wild beasts of the earth, and to all the flying creatures of heaven, and to every reptile creeping on the earth, which has in itself the breath of life, even every green plant for food; and it was so.
001	GEN	001	031	And God saw all the things that he had made, and, behold, they were very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.
001	GEN	002	001	And the heavens and the earth were finished, and the whole world of them.
001	GEN	002	002	And God finished on the sixth day his works which he made, and he ceased on the seventh day from all his works which he made.
001	GEN	002	003	And God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because in it he ceased from all his works which God began to do.
001	GEN	002	004	This [is] the book of the generation of heaven and earth, when they were made, in the day in which the Lord God made the heaven and the earth,
001	GEN	002	005	and every herb of the field before it was on the earth, and all the grass of the field before it sprang up, for God had not rained on the earth, and there was not a man to cultivate it.
001	GEN	002	006	But there rose a fountain out of the earth, and watered the whole face of the earth.
001	GEN	002	007	And God formed the man [of] dust of the earth, and breathed upon his face the breath of life, and the man became a living soul.
001	GEN	002	008	And God planted a garden eastward in Edem, and placed there the man whom he had formed.
001	GEN	002	009	And God made to spring up also out of the earth every tree beautiful to the eye and good for food, and the tree of life in the midst of the garden, and the tree of learning the knowledge of good and evil.
001	GEN	002	010	And a river proceeds out of Edem to water the garden, thence it divides itself into four heads.
001	GEN	002	011	The name of the one, Phisom, this it is which encircles the whole land of Evilat, where there is gold.
001	GEN	002	012	And the gold of that land is good, there also is carbuncle and emerald.
001	GEN	002	013	And the name of the second river is Geon, this it is which encircles the whole land of Ethiopia.
001	GEN	002	014	And the third river is Tigris, this is that which flows forth over against the Assyrians. And the fourth river is Euphrates.
001	GEN	002	015	And the Lord God took the man whom he had formed, and placed him in the garden of Delight, to cultivate and keep it.
001	GEN	002	016	And the Lord God gave a charge to Adam, saying, Of every tree which is in the garden thou mayest freely eat,
001	GEN	002	017	but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil—of it ye shall not eat, but in whatsoever day ye eat of it, ye shall surely die.
001	GEN	002	018	And the Lord God said, [It is] not good that the man should be alone, let us make for him a help suitable to him.
001	GEN	002	019	And God formed yet farther out of the earth all the wild beasts of the field, and all the birds of the sky, and he brought them to Adam, to see what he would call them, and whatever Adam called any living creature, that was the name of it.
001	GEN	002	020	And Adam gave names to all the cattle and to all the birds of the sky, and to all the wild beasts of the field, but for Adam there was not found a help like to himself.
001	GEN	002	021	And God brought a trance upon Adam, and he slept, and he took one of his ribs, and filled up the flesh instead thereof.
001	GEN	002	022	And God formed the rib which he took from Adam into a woman, and brought her to Adam.
001	GEN	002	023	And Adam said, This now is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called woman, because she was taken out of her husband.
001	GEN	002	024	Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave to his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.
001	GEN	003	001	And the two were naked, both Adam and his wife, and were not ashamed. Now the serpent was the most crafty of all the brutes on the earth, which the Lord God made, and the serpent said to the woman, Wherefore has God said, Eat not of every tree of the garden?
001	GEN	003	002	And the woman said to the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden,
001	GEN	003	003	but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
001	GEN	003	004	And the serpent said to the woman, Ye shall not surely die.
001	GEN	003	005	For God knew that in whatever day ye should eat of it your eyes would be opened, and ye would be as gods, knowing good and evil.
001	GEN	003	006	And the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes to look upon and beautiful to contemplate, and having taken of its fruit she ate, and she gave to her husband also with her, and they ate.
001	GEN	003	007	And the eyes of both were opened, and they perceived that they were naked, and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons to go round them.
001	GEN	003	008	And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the afternoon; and both Adam and his wife hid themselves from the face of the Lord God in the midst of the trees of the garden.
001	GEN	003	009	And the Lord God called Adam and said to him, Adam, where art thou?
001	GEN	003	010	And he said to him, I heard thy voice as thou walkedst in the garden, and I feared because I was naked and I hid myself.
001	GEN	003	011	And God said to him, Who told thee that thou wast naked, unless thou hast eaten of the tree concerning which I charged thee of it alone not to eat?
001	GEN	003	012	And Adam said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me—she gave me of the tree and I ate.
001	GEN	003	013	And the Lord God said to the woman, Why hast thou done this? And the woman said, The serpent deceived me and I ate.
001	GEN	003	014	And the Lord God said to the serpent, Because thou hast done this thou art cursed above all cattle and all the brutes of the earth, on thy breast and belly thou shalt go, and thou shalt eat earth all the days of thy life.
001	GEN	003	015	And I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed, he shall watch against thy head, and thou shalt watch against his heel.
001	GEN	003	016	And to the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy pains and thy groanings; in pain thou shalt bring forth children, and thy submission shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
001	GEN	003	017	And to Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife, and eaten of the tree concerning which I charged thee of it only not to eat—of that thou hast eaten, cursed [is] the ground in thy labours, in pain shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life.
001	GEN	003	018	Thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to thee, and thou shalt eat the herb of the field.
001	GEN	003	019	In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat thy bread until thou return to the earth out of which thou wast taken, for earth thou art and to earth thou shalt return.
001	GEN	003	020	And Adam called the name of his wife Life, because she was the mother of all living.
001	GEN	003	021	And the Lord God made for Adam and his wife garments of skin, and clothed them.
001	GEN	003	022	And God said, Behold, Adam is become as one of us, to know good and evil, and now lest at any time he stretch forth his hand, and take of the tree of life and eat, and [so] he shall live for ever—
001	GEN	003	023	So the Lord God sent him forth out of the garden of Delight to cultivate the ground out of which he was taken.
001	GEN	003	024	And he cast out Adam and caused him to dwell over against the garden of Delight, and stationed the cherubs and the fiery sword that turns about to keep the way of the tree of life.
001	GEN	004	001	And Adam knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and brought forth Cain and said, I have gained a man through God.
001	GEN	004	002	And she again bore his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.
001	GEN	004	003	And it was so after some time that Cain brought of the fruits of the earth a sacrifice to the Lord.
001	GEN	004	004	And Abel also brought of the firstborn of his sheep and of his fatlings, and God looked upon Abel and his gifts,
001	GEN	004	005	but Cain and his sacrifices he regarded not, and Cain was exceedingly sorrowful and his countenance fell.
001	GEN	004	006	And the Lord God said to Cain, Why art thou become very sorrowful and why is thy countenance fallen?
001	GEN	004	007	Hast thou not sinned if thou hast brought it rightly, but not rightly divided it? be still, to thee shall be his submission, and thou shalt rule over him.
001	GEN	004	008	And Cain said to Abel his brother, Let us go out into the plain; and it came to pass that when they were in the plain Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.
001	GEN	004	009	And the Lord God said to Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? and he said, I know not, am I my brother's keeper?
001	GEN	004	010	And the Lord said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood cries to me out of the ground.
001	GEN	004	011	And now thou [art] cursed from the earth which has opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand.
001	GEN	004	012	When thou tillest the earth, then it shall not continue to give its strength to thee: thou shalt be groaning and trembling on the earth.
001	GEN	004	013	And Cain said to the Lord God, My crime [is] too great for me to be forgiven.
001	GEN	004	014	If thou castest me out this day from the face of the earth, and I shall be hidden from thy presence, and I shall be groaning and trembling upon the earth, then it will be that any one that finds me shall slay me.
001	GEN	004	015	And the Lord God said to him, Not so, any one that slays Cain shall suffer seven-fold vengeance; and the Lord God set a mark upon Cain that no one that found him might slay him.
001	GEN	004	016	So Cain went forth from the presence of God and dwelt in the land of Nod over against Edem.
001	GEN	004	017	And Cain knew his wife, and having conceived she bore Enoch; and he built a city; and he named the city after the name of his son, Enoch.
001	GEN	004	018	And to Enoch was born Gaidad; and Gaidad begot Maleleel; and Maleleel begot Mathusala; and Mathusala begot Lamech.
001	GEN	004	019	And Lamech took to himself two wives; the name of the one was Ada, and the name of the second Sella.
001	GEN	004	020	And Ada bore Jobel; he was the father of those that dwell in tents, feeding cattle.
001	GEN	004	021	And the name of his brother was Jubal; he it was who invented the psaltery and harp.
001	GEN	004	022	And Sella also bore Thobel; he was a smith, a manufacturer both of brass and iron; and the sister of Thobel was Noëma.
001	GEN	004	023	And Lamech said to his wives, Ada and Sella, Hear my voice, ye wives of Lamech, consider my words, because I have slain a man to my sorrow and a youth to my grief.
001	GEN	004	024	Because vengeance has been exacted seven times on Cain's behalf, on Lamech's [it shall be] seventy times seven.
001	GEN	004	025	And Adam knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and bore a son, and called his name Seth, saying, For God has raised up to me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.
001	GEN	004	026	And Seth had a son, and he called his name Enos: he hoped to call on the name of the Lord God.
001	GEN	005	001	This [is] the genealogy of men in the day in which God made Adam; in the image of God he made him:
001	GEN	005	002	male and female he made them, and blessed them; and he called his name Adam, in the day in which he made them.
001	GEN	005	003	And Adam lived two hundred and thirty years, and begot [a son] after his [own] form, and after his [own] image, and he called his name Seth.
001	GEN	005	004	And the days of Adam, which he lived after his begetting Seth, were seven hundred years; and he begot sons and daughters.
001	GEN	005	005	And all the days of Adam which he lived were nine hundred and thirty years, and he died.
001	GEN	005	006	Now Seth lived two hundred and five years, and begot Enos.
001	GEN	005	007	And Seth lived after his begetting Enos, seven hundred and seven years, and he begot sons and daughters.
001	GEN	005	008	And all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years, and he died.
001	GEN	005	009	And Enos lived an hundred and ninety years, and begot Cainan.
001	GEN	005	010	And Enos lived after his begetting Cainan, seven hundred and fifteen years, and he begot sons and daughters.
001	GEN	005	011	And all the days of Enos were nine hundred and five years, and he died.
001	GEN	005	012	And Cainan lived an hundred and seventy years, and he begot Maleleel.
001	GEN	005	013	And Cainan lived after his begetting Maleleel, seven hundred and forty years, and he begot sons and daughters.
001	GEN	005	014	And all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years, and he died.
001	GEN	005	015	And Maleleel lived an hundred and sixty and five years, and he begot Jared.
001	GEN	005	016	And Maleleel lived after his begetting Jared, seven hundred and thirty years, and he begot sons and daughters.
001	GEN	005	017	And all the days of Maleleel were eight hundred and ninety and five years, and he died.
001	GEN	005	018	And Jared lived an hundred and sixty and two years, and begot Enoch:
001	GEN	005	019	and Jared lived after his begetting Enoch, eight hundred years, and he begot sons and daughters.
001	GEN	005	020	And all the days of Jared were nine hundred and sixty and two years, and he died.
001	GEN	005	021	And Enoch lived an hundred and sixty and five years, and begat Mathusala.
001	GEN	005	022	And Enoch was well-pleasing to God after his begetting Mathusala, two hundred years, and he begot sons and daughters.
001	GEN	005	023	And all the days of Enoch were three hundred and sixty and five years.
001	GEN	005	024	And Enoch was well-pleasing to God, and was not found, because God translated him.
001	GEN	005	025	And Mathusala lived an hundred and sixty and seven years, and begot Lamech.
001	GEN	005	026	And Mathusala lived after his begetting Lamech eight hundred and two years, and begot sons and daughters.
001	GEN	005	027	And all the days of Mathusala which he lived, were nine hundred and sixty and nine years, and he died.
001	GEN	005	028	And Lamech lived an hundred and eighty and eight years, and begot a son.
001	GEN	005	029	And he called his name Noe, saying, This one will cause us to cease from our works, and from the toils of our hands, and from the earth, which the Lord God has cursed.
001	GEN	005	030	And Lamech lived after his begetting Noe, five hundred and sixty and five years, and begot sons and daughters.
001	GEN	005	031	And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred and fifty-three years, and he died.
001	GEN	006	001	And Noe was five hundred years old, and he begot three sons, Sem, Cham, and Japheth. And it came to pass when men began to be numerous upon the earth, and daughters were born to them,
001	GEN	006	002	that the sons of God having seen the daughters of men that they were beautiful, took to themselves wives of all whom they chose.
001	GEN	006	003	And the Lord God said, My Spirit shall certainly not remain among these men for ever, because they are flesh, but their days shall be an hundred and twenty years.
001	GEN	006	004	Now the giants were upon the earth in those days; and after that when the sons of God were wont to go in to the daughters of men, they bore [children] to them, those were the giants of old, the men of renown.
001	GEN	006	005	And the Lord God, having seen that the wicked actions of men were multiplied upon the earth, and that every one in his heart was intently brooding over evil continually,
001	GEN	006	006	then God laid it to heart that he had made man upon the earth, and he pondered [it] deeply.
001	GEN	006	007	And God said, I will blot out man whom I have made from the face of the earth, even man with cattle, and reptiles with flying creatures of the sky, for I am grieved that I have made them.
001	GEN	006	008	But Noe found grace before the Lord God.
001	GEN	006	009	And these [are] the generations of Noe. Noe was a just man; being perfect in his generation, Noe was well-pleasing to God.
001	GEN	006	010	And Noe begot three sons, Sem, Cham, Japheth.
001	GEN	006	011	But the earth was corrupted before God, and the earth was filled with iniquity.
001	GEN	006	012	And the Lord God saw the earth, and it was corrupted; because all flesh had corrupted its way upon the earth.
001	GEN	006	013	And the Lord God said to Noe, A period of all men is come before me; because the earth has been filled with iniquity by them, and, behold, I destroy them and the earth.
001	GEN	006	014	Make therefore for thyself an ark of square timber; thou shalt make the ark in compartments, and thou shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.
001	GEN	006	015	And thus shalt thou make the ark; three hundred cubits the length of the ark, and fifty cubits the breadth, and thirty cubits the height of it.
001	GEN	006	016	Thou shalt narrow the ark in making it, and in a cubit above thou shalt finish it, and the door of the ark thou shalt make on the side; with lower, second, and third stories thou shalt make it.
001	GEN	006	017	And behold I bring a flood of water upon the earth, to destroy all flesh in which is the breath of life under heaven, and whatsoever things are upon the earth shall die.
001	GEN	006	018	And I will establish my covenant with thee, and thou shalt enter into the ark, and thy sons and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.
001	GEN	006	019	And of all cattle and of all reptiles and of all wild beasts, even of all flesh, thou shalt bring by pairs of all, into the ark, that thou mayest feed them with thyself: male and female they shall be.
001	GEN	006	020	Of all winged birds after their kind, and of all cattle after their kind, and of all reptiles creeping upon the earth after their kind, pairs of all shall come in to thee, male and female to be fed with thee.
001	GEN	006	021	And thou shalt take to thyself of all kinds of food which ye eat, and thou shalt gather them to thyself, and it shall be for thee and them to eat.
001	GEN	006	022	And Noe did all things whatever the Lord God commanded him, so did he.
001	GEN	007	001	And the Lord God said to Noe, Enter thou and all thy family into the ark, for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation.
001	GEN	007	002	And of the clean cattle take in to thee sevens, male and female, and of the unclean cattle pairs male and female.
001	GEN	007	003	And of clean flying creatures of the sky sevens, male and female, and of all unclean flying creatures pairs, male and female, to maintain seed on all the earth.
001	GEN	007	004	For yet seven days [having passed] I bring rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights, and I will blot out every offspring which I have made from the face of all the earth.
001	GEN	007	005	And Noe [did] all things whatever the Lord God commanded him.
001	GEN	007	006	And Noe was six hundred years old when the flood of water was upon the earth.
001	GEN	007	007	And then went in Noe and his sons and his wife, and his sons' wives with him into the ark, because of the water of the flood.

001	GEN	014	009	against Chodollogomor king of Elam, and Thargal king of nations, and Amarphal king of Sennaar, and Arioch king of Ellasar, the four kings against the five.
001	GEN	014	010	Now the salt valley [consists of] slime-pits. And the king of Sodom fled and the king of Gomorrha, and they fell in there: and they that were left fled to the mountain country.
001	GEN	014	011	And they took all the cavalry of Sodom and Gomorrha, and all their provisions, and departed.
001	GEN	014	012	And they took also Lot the son of Abram's brother, and his baggage, and departed, for he dwelt in Sodom.
001	GEN	014	013	And one of them that had been rescued came and told Abram the Hebrew; and he dwelt by the oak of Mamre the Amorite the brother of Eschol, and the brother of Aunan, who were confederates with Abram.
001	GEN	014	014	And Abram having heard that Lot his nephew had been taken captive, numbered his own home-born [servants] three hundred and eighteen, and pursued after them to Dan.
001	GEN	014	015	And he came upon them by night, he and his servants, and he smote them and pursued them as far as Choba, which is on the left of Damascus.
001	GEN	014	016	And he recovered all the cavalry of Sodom, and he recovered Lot his nephew, and all his possessions, and the women and the people.
001	GEN	014	017	And the king of Sodom went out to meet him, after he returned from the slaughter of Chodollogomor, and the kings with him, to the valley of Saby; this was the plain of the kings.
001	GEN	014	018	And Melchisedec king of Salem brought forth loaves and wine, and he was the priest of the most high God.
001	GEN	014	019	And he blessed Abram, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, who made heaven and earth,
001	GEN	014	020	and blessed be the most high God who delivered thine enemies into thy power. And Abram gave him the tithe of all.
001	GEN	014	021	And the king of Sodom said to Abram, Give me the men, and take the horses to thyself.
001	GEN	014	022	And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I will stretch out my hand to the Lord the most high God, who made the heaven and the earth,
001	GEN	014	023	[that] I will not take from all thy goods from a string to a shoe-latchet, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich.
001	GEN	014	024	Except what things the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men that went with me, Eschol, Aunan, Mambre, these shall take a portion.
001	GEN	015	001	And after these things the word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram, I shield thee, thy reward shall be very great.
001	GEN	015	002	And Abram said, Master [and] Lord, what wilt thou give me? whereas I am departing without a child, but the son of Masek my home-born female slave, this Eliezer of Damascus [is mine heir.]
001	GEN	015	003	And Abram said, [I am grieved] since thou hast given me no seed, but my home-born [servant] shall succeed me.
001	GEN	015	004	And immediately there was a voice of the Lord to him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come out of thee shall be thine heir.
001	GEN	015	005	And he brought him out and said to him, Look up now to heaven, and count the stars, if thou shalt be able to number them fully, and he said, Thus shall thy seed be.
001	GEN	015	006	And Abram believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness.
001	GEN	015	007	And he said to him, I am God that brought thee out of the land of the Chaldeans, so as to give thee this land to inherit.
001	GEN	015	008	And he said, Master [and] Lord, how shall I know that I shall inherit it?
001	GEN	015	009	And he said to him, Take for me an heifer in her third year, and a she-goat in her third year, and a ram in his third year, and a dove and a pigeon.
001	GEN	015	010	So he took to him all these, and divided them in the midst, and set them opposite to each other, but the birds he did not divide.
001	GEN	015	011	And birds came down upon the bodies, [even] upon the divided parts of them, and Abram sat down by them.
001	GEN	015	012	And about sunset a trance fell upon Abram, and lo! a great gloomy terror falls upon him.
001	GEN	015	013	And it was said to Abram, Thou shalt surely know that thy seed shall be a sojourner in a land not their won, and they shall enslave them, and afflict them, and humble them four hundred years.
001	GEN	015	014	And the nation whomsoever they shall serve I will judge; and after this, they shall come forth hither with much property.
001	GEN	015	015	But thou shalt depart to thy fathers in peace, nourished in a good old age.
001	GEN	015	016	And in the fourth generation they shall return hither, for the sins of the Amorites are not yet filled up, even until now.
001	GEN	015	017	And when the sun was about to set, there was a flame, and behold a smoking furnace and lamps of fire, which passed between these divided pieces.
001	GEN	015	018	In that day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, To thy seed I will give this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river Euphrates.
001	GEN	015	019	The Kenites, and the Kenezites, and the Kedmoneans,
001	GEN	015	020	and the Chettites, and the Pherezites, and the Raphaim,
001	GEN	015	021	and the Amorites, and the Chananites, and the Evites, and the Gergesites, and the Jebusites.
001	GEN	016	001	And Sara the wife of Abram bore him no children; and she had an Egyptian maid, whose name was Agar.
001	GEN	016	002	And Sara said to Abram, Behold, the Lord has restrained me from bearing, go therefore in to my maid, that I may get children for myself through her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sara.
001	GEN	016	003	So Sara the wife of Abram having taken Agar the Egyptian her handmaid, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Chanaan, gave her to Abram her husband as a wife to him.
001	GEN	016	004	And he went in to Agar, and she conceived, and saw that she was with child, and her mistress was dishonoured before her.
001	GEN	016	005	And Sara said to Abram, I am injured by thee; I gave my handmaid into thy bosom, and when I saw that she was with child, I was dishonoured before her. The Lord judge between me and thee.
001	GEN	016	006	And Abram said to Sara, Behold thy handmaid is in thy hands, use her as it may seem good to thee. And Sara afflicted her, and she fled from her face.
001	GEN	016	007	And an angel of the Lord found her by the fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Sur.
001	GEN	016	008	And the angel of the Lord said to her, Agar, Sara's maid, whence comest thou, and wither goest thou? and she said, I am fleeing from the face of my mistress Sara.
001	GEN	016	009	And the angel of the Lord said to her, Return to thy mistress, and submit thyself under her hands.
001	GEN	016	010	And the angel of the Lord said to her, I will surely multiply thy seed, and it shall not be numbered for multitude.
001	GEN	016	011	And the angel of the Lord said to her, Behold thou art with child, and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name Ismael, for the Lord hath hearkened to thy humiliation.
001	GEN	016	012	He shall be a wild man, his hands against all, and the hands of all against him, and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.
001	GEN	016	013	And she called the name of the Lord God who spoke to her, Thou art God who seest me; for she said, For I have openly seen him that appeared to me.
001	GEN	016	014	Therefore she called the well, The well of him whom I have openly seen; behold it is between Cades and Barad.
001	GEN	016	015	And Agar bore a son to Abram; and Abram called the name of his son which Agar bore to him, Ismael.
001	GEN	016	016	And Abram was eighty-six years old, when Agar bore Ismael to Abram.
001	GEN	017	001	And Abram was ninety-nine years old, and the Lord appeared to Abram and said to him, I am thy God, be well-pleasing before me, and be blameless.
001	GEN	017	002	And I will establish my covenant between me and thee, and I will multiply thee exceedingly.
001	GEN	017	003	And Abram fell upon his face, and God spoke to him, saying,
001	GEN	017	004	And I, behold! my covenant [is] with thee, and thou shalt be a father of a multitude of nations.
001	GEN	017	005	And thy name shall no more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraam, for I have made thee a father of many nations.
001	GEN	017	006	And I will increase thee very exceedingly, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee.
001	GEN	017	007	And I will establish my covenant between thee and thy seed after thee, to their generations, for an everlasting covenant, to be thy God, and [the God] of thy seed after thee.
001	GEN	017	008	And I will give to thee and to thy seed after thee the land wherein thou sojournest, even all the land of Chanaan for an everlasting possession, and I will be to them a God.
001	GEN	017	009	And God said to Abraam, Thou also shalt fully keep my covenant, thou and thy seed after thee for their generations.
001	GEN	017	010	And this [is] the covenant which thou shalt fully keep between me and you, and between thy seed after thee for their generations; every male of you shall be circumcised.
001	GEN	017	011	And ye shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin, and it shall be for a sign of a covenant between me and you.
001	GEN	017	012	And the child of eight days [old] shall be circumcised by you, every male throughout your generations, and [the servant] born in the house and he that is bought with money, of every son of a stranger, who is not of thy seed.
001	GEN	017	013	He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with money shall be surely circumcised, and my covenant shall be on your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
001	GEN	017	014	And the uncircumcised male, who shall not be circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin on the eighth day, that soul shall be utterly destroyed from its family, for he has broken my covenant.
001	GEN	017	015	And God said to Abraam, Sara thy wife—her name shall not be called Sara, Sarrha shall be her name.
001	GEN	017	016	And I will bless her, and give thee a son of her, and I will bless him, and he shall become nations, and kings of nations shall be of him.
001	GEN	017	017	And Abraam fell upon his face, and laughed; and spoke in his heart, saying, Shall there be a child to one who is a hundred years old, and shall Sarrha who is ninety years old, bear?
001	GEN	017	018	And Abraam said to God, Let this Ismael live before thee.
001	GEN	017	019	And God said to Abraam, Yea, behold, Sarrha thy wife shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name Isaac; and I will establish my covenant with him, for an everlasting covenant, to be a God to him and to his seed after him.
001	GEN	017	020	And concerning Ismael, behold, I have heard thee, and, behold, I have blessed him, and will increase him and multiply him exceedingly; twelve nations shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.
001	GEN	017	021	But I will establish my covenant with Isaac, whom Sarrha shall bear to thee at this time, in the next year.
001	GEN	017	022	And he left off speaking with him, and God went up from Abraam.
001	GEN	017	023	And Abraam took Ismael his son, and all his home-born [servants], and all those bought with money, and every male of the men in the house of Abraam, and he circumcised their foreskins in the time of that day, according as God spoke to him.
001	GEN	017	024	And Abraam was ninety-nine years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
001	GEN	017	025	And Ismael his son was thirteen years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
001	GEN	017	026	And at the period of that day, Abraam was circumcised, and Ismael his son,
001	GEN	017	027	and all the men of his house, both those born in the house, and those bought with money of foreign nations.
001	GEN	018	001	And God appeared to him by the oak of Mambre, as he sat by the door of his tent at noon.
001	GEN	018	002	And he lifted up his eyes and beheld, and lo! three men stood before him; and having seen them he ran to meet them from the door of his tent, and did obeisance to the ground.
001	GEN	018	003	And he said, Lord, if indeed I have found grace in thy sight, pass not by thy servant.
001	GEN	018	004	Let water now be brought, and let them wash your feet, and do ye refresh [yourselves] under the tree.
001	GEN	018	005	And I will bring bread, and ye shall eat, and after this ye shall depart on your journey, on account of which [refreshment] ye have turned aside to your servant. And he said, So do, as thou hast said.
001	GEN	018	006	And Abraam hasted to the tent to Sarrha, and said to her, Hasten, and knead three measures of fine flour, and make cakes.
001	GEN	018	007	And Abraam ran to the kine, and took a young calf, tender and good, and gave it to his servant, and he hasted to dress it.
001	GEN	018	008	And he took butter and milk, and the calf which he had dressed; and he set them before them, and they did eat, and he stood by them under the tree.
001	GEN	018	009	And he said to him, Where is Sarrha thy wife? And he answered and said, Behold! in the tent.
001	GEN	018	010	And he said, I will return and come to thee according to this period seasonably, and Sarrha thy wife shall have a son; and Sarrha heard at the door of the tent, being behind him.
001	GEN	018	011	And Abraam and Sarrha were old, advanced in days, and the custom of women ceased with Sarrha.
001	GEN	018	012	And Sarrha laughed in herself, saying, The thing has not as yet happened to me, even until now, and my lord is old.
001	GEN	018	013	And the Lord said to Abraam, Why is it that Sarrha has laughed in herself, saying, Shall I then indeed bear? but I am grown old.
001	GEN	018	014	Shall anything be impossible with the Lord? At this time I will return to thee seasonably, and Sarrha shall have a son.
001	GEN	018	015	But Sarrha denied, saying, I did not laugh, for she was afraid. And he said to her, Nay, but thou didst laugh.
001	GEN	018	016	And the men having risen up from thence looked towards Sodom and Gomorrha. And Abraam went with them, attending them on their journey.
001	GEN	018	017	And the Lord said, Shall I hide from Abraam my servant what things I intend to do?
001	GEN	018	018	But Abraam shall become a great and populous nation, and in him shall all the nations of the earth be blest.
001	GEN	018	019	For I know that he will order his sons, and his house after him, and they will keep the ways of the Lord, to do justice and judgment, that the Lord may bring upon Abraam all things whatsoever he has spoken to him.
001	GEN	018	020	And the Lord said, The cry of Sodom and Gomorrha has been increased towards me, and their sins are very great.
001	GEN	018	021	I will therefore go down and see, if they completely correspond with the cry which comes to me, and if not, that I may know.
001	GEN	018	022	And the men having departed thence, came to Sodom; and Abraam was still standing before the Lord.
001	GEN	018	023	And Abraam drew nigh and said, Wouldest thou destroy the righteous with the wicked, and shall the righteous be as the wicked?
001	GEN	018	024	Should there be fifty righteous in the city, wilt thou destroy them? wilt thou not spare the whole place for the sake of the fifty righteous, if they be in it?
001	GEN	018	025	By no means shalt thou do as this thing [is] so as to destroy the righteous with the wicked, so the righteous shall be as the wicked: by no means. Thou that judgest the whole earth, shalt thou not do right?
001	GEN	018	026	And the Lord said, If there should be in Sodom fifty righteous in the city, I will spare the whole city, and the whole place for their sakes.
001	GEN	018	027	And Abraam answered and said, Now I have begun to speak to my Lord, and I am earth and ashes.
001	GEN	018	028	But if the fifty righteous should be diminished to forty-five, wilt thou destroy the whole city because of the five [wanting]? And he said, I will not destroy it, if I should find there forty-five.
001	GEN	018	029	And he continued to speak to him still, and said, But if there should be found there forty? And he said, I will not destroy it for the forty's sake.
001	GEN	018	030	And he said, Will there be anything [against me], Lord, if I shall speak? but if there be found there thirty? And he said, I will not destroy it for the thirty's sake.
001	GEN	018	031	And he said, Since I am able to speak to the Lord, what if there should be found there twenty? And he said, I will not destroy it, if I should find there twenty.
001	GEN	018	032	And he said, Will there be anything [against me], Lord, if I speak yet once? but if there should be found there ten? And he said, I will not destroy it for the ten's sake.
001	GEN	018	033	And the Lord departed, when he left off speaking to Abraam, and Abraam returned to his place.
001	GEN	019	001	And the two angels came to Sodom at evening. And Lot sat by the gate of Sodom, and Lot having seen them, rose up to meet them, and he worshipped with his face to the ground, and said,
001	GEN	019	002	Lo! [my] lords, turn aside to the house of your servant, and rest from your journey, and wash your feet, and having risen early in the morning ye shall depart on your journey. And they said, Nay, but we will lodge in the street.
001	GEN	019	003	And he constrained them, and they turned aside to him, and they entered into his house, and he made a feast for them, and baked unleavened cakes for them, and they did eat.
001	GEN	019	004	But before they went to sleep, the men of the city, the Sodomites, compassed the house, both young and old, all the people together.
001	GEN	019	005	And they called out Lot, and said to him, Where are the men that went in to thee this night? bring them out to us that we may be with them.
001	GEN	019	006	And Lot went out to them to the porch, and he shut the door after him,
001	GEN	019	007	and said to them, By no means, brethren, do not act villanously.
001	GEN	019	008	But I have two daughters, who have not known a man. I will bring them out to you, and do ye use them as it may please you, only do not injury to these men, to avoid which they came under the shelter of my roof.
001	GEN	019	009	And they said to him, Stand back there, thou camest in to sojourn, was it also to judge? Now then we would harm thee more than them. And they pressed hard on the man, even Lot, and they drew nigh to break the door.
001	GEN	019	010	And the men stretched forth their hands and drew Lot in to them into the house, and shut the door of the house.
001	GEN	019	011	And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great, and they were wearied with seeking the door.
001	GEN	019	012	And the men said to Lot, Hast thou here sons-in-law, or sons or daughters, or if thou hast any other friend in the city, bring them out of this place.
001	GEN	019	013	For we are going to destroy this place; for their cry has been raised up before the Lord, and the Lord has sent us to destroy it.
001	GEN	019	014	And Lot went out, and spoke to his sons-in-law who had married his daughters, and said, Rise up, and depart out of this place, for the Lord is about to destroy the city; but he seemed to be speaking absurdly before his sons-in-law.
001	GEN	019	015	But when it was morning, the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise and take thy wife, and thy two daughters whom thou hast, and go forth; lest thou also be destroyed with the iniquities of the city.
001	GEN	019	016	And they were troubled, and the angels laid hold on his hand, and the hand of his wife, and the hands of his two daughters, in that the Lord spared him.
001	GEN	019	017	And it came to pass when they brought them out, that they said, Save thine own life by all means; look not round to that which is behind, nor stay in all the country round about, escape to the mountain, lest perhaps thou be overtaken together with them.
001	GEN	019	018	And Lot said to them, I pray, Lord,
001	GEN	019	019	since thy servant has found mercy before thee, and thou hast magnified thy righteousness, in what thou doest towards me that my soul may live, —but I shall not be able to escape to the mountain, lest perhaps the calamity overtake me and I die.
001	GEN	019	020	Behold this city is near for me to escape thither, which is a small one, and there shall I be preserved, is it not little? and my soul shall live because of thee.
001	GEN	019	021	And he said to him, Behold, I have had respect to thee also about this thing, that I should not overthrow the city about which thou hast spoken.
001	GEN	019	022	Hasten therefore to escape thither, for I shall not be able to do anything until thou art come thither; therefore he called the name of that city, Segor.
001	GEN	019	023	The sun was risen upon the earth, when Lot entered into Segor.
001	GEN	019	024	And the Lord rained on Sodom and Gomorrha brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven.
001	GEN	019	025	And he overthrew these cities, and all the country round about, and all that dwelt in the cities, and the plants springing out of the ground.
001	GEN	019	026	And his wife looked back, and she became a pillar of salt.
001	GEN	019	027	And Abraam rose up early to go to the place, where he had stood before the Lord.
001	GEN	019	028	And he looked towards Sodom and Gomorrha, and towards the surrounding country, and saw, and behold a flame went up from the earth, as the smoke of a furnace.
001	GEN	019	029	And it came to pass that when God destroyed all the cities of the region round about, God remembered Abraam, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when the Lord overthrew those cities in which Lot dwelt.
001	GEN	019	030	And Lot went up out of Segor, and dwelt in the mountain, he and his two daughters with him, for he feared to dwell in Segor; and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters with him.
001	GEN	019	031	And the elder said to the younger, Our father is old, and there is no one on the earth who shall come in to us, as it is fit in all the earth.
001	GEN	019	032	Come and let us make our father drink wine, and let us sleep with him, and let us raise up seed from our father.
001	GEN	019	033	So they made their father drink wine in that night, and the elder went in and lay with her father that night, and he knew not when he slept and when he rose up.
001	GEN	019	034	And it came to pass on the morrow, that the elder said to the younger, Behold, I slept yesternight with our father, let us make him drink wine in this night also, and do thou go in and sleep with him, and let us raise up seed of our father.
001	GEN	019	035	So they made their father drink wine in that night also, and the younger went in and slept with her father, and he knew not when he slept, nor when he arose.
001	GEN	019	036	And the two daughters of Lot conceived by their father.
001	GEN	019	037	And the elder bore a son and called his name Moab, saying, [He is] of my father. This is the father of the Moabites to this present day.
001	GEN	019	038	And the younger also bore a son, and called his name Amman, saying, The son of my family. This is the father of the Ammanites to this present day.
001	GEN	020	001	And Abraam removed thence to the southern country, and dwelt between Cades and Sur, and sojourned in Gerara.
001	GEN	020	002	And Abraam said concerning Sarrha his wife, She is my sister, for he feared to say, She is my wife, lest at any time the men of the city should kill him for her sake. So Abimelech king of Gerara sent and took Sarrha.
001	GEN	020	003	And God came to Abimelech by night in sleep, and said, Behold, thou diest for the woman, whom thou hast taken, whereas she has lived with a husband.
001	GEN	020	004	But Abimelech had not touched her, and he said, Lord, wilt thou destroy an ignorantly [sinning] and just nation?
001	GEN	020	005	Said he not to me, She is my sister, and said she not to me, He is my brother? with a pure heart and in the righteousness of my hands have I done this.
001	GEN	020	006	And God said to him in sleep, Yea, I knew that thou didst this with a pure heart, and I spared thee, so that thou shouldest not sin against me, therefore I suffered thee not to touch her.
001	GEN	020	007	But now return the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live; but if thou restore her not, know that thou shalt die and all thine.
001	GEN	020	008	And Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and he spoke all these words in their ears, and all the men feared exceedingly.
001	GEN	020	009	And Abimelech called Abraam and said to him, What is this that thou hast done to us? Have we sinned against thee, that thou hast brought upon me and upon my kingdom a great sin? Thou hast done to me a deed, which no one ought to do.
001	GEN	020	010	And Abimelech said to Abraam, What hast thou seen in [me] that thou hast done this?
001	GEN	020	011	And Abraam said, Why I said, Surely there is not the worship of God in this place, and they will slay me because of my wife.
001	GEN	020	012	For truly she is my sister by my father, but not by my mother, and she became my wife.
001	GEN	020	013	And it came to pass when God brought me forth out of the house of my father, that I said to her, This righteousness thou shalt perform to me, in every place into which we may enter, say of me, He is my brother.
001	GEN	020	014	And Abimelech took a thousand pieces of silver, and sheep, and calves, and servants, and maid-servants, and gave them to Abraam, and he returned him Sarrha his wife.
001	GEN	020	015	And Abimelech said to Abraam, Behold, my land is before thee, dwell wheresoever it may please thee.
001	GEN	020	016	And to Sarrha he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver, those shall be to thee for the price of thy countenance, and to all the women with thee, and speak the truth in all things.
001	GEN	020	017	And Abraam prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his women servants, and they bore children.
001	GEN	020	018	Because the Lord had fast closed from without every womb in the house of Abimelech, because of Sarrha Abraam's wife.
001	GEN	021	001	And the Lord visited Sarrha, as he said, and the Lord did to Sarrha, as he spoke.
001	GEN	021	002	And she conceived and bore to Abraam a son in old age, at the set time according as the Lord spoke to him.
001	GEN	021	003	And Abraam called the name of his son that was born to him, whom Sarrha bore to him, Isaac.
001	GEN	021	004	And Abraam circumcised Isaac on the eighth day, as God commanded him.
001	GEN	021	005	And Abraam was a hundred years old when Isaac his son was born to him.
001	GEN	021	006	And Sarrha said, The Lord has made laughter for me, for whoever shall hear shall rejoice with me.
001	GEN	021	007	And she said, Who shall say to Abraam that Sarrha suckles a child? for I have born a child in my old age.
001	GEN	021	008	And the child grew and was weaned, and Abraam made a great feast the day that his son Isaac was weaned.
001	GEN	021	009	And Sarrha having seen the son of Agar the Egyptian who was born to Abraam, sporting with Isaac her son,
001	GEN	021	010	then she said to Abraam, Cast out this bondwoman and her son, for the son of this bondwoman shall not inherit with my son Isaac.
001	GEN	021	011	But the word appeared very hard before Abraam concerning his son.
001	GEN	021	012	But God said to Abraam, Let it not be hard before thee concerning the child, and concerning the bondwoman; in all things whatsoever Sarrha shall say to thee, hear her voice, for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.
001	GEN	021	013	And moreover I will make the son of this bondwoman a great nation, because he is thy seed.
001	GEN	021	014	And Abraam rose up in the morning and took loaves and a skin of water, and gave [them] to Agar, and he put the child on her shoulder, and sent her away, and she having departed wandered in the wilderness near the well of the oath.
001	GEN	021	015	And the water failed out of the skin, and she cast the child under a fir tree.
001	GEN	021	016	And she departed and sat down opposite him at a distance, as it were a bow-shot, for she said, Surely I cannot see the death of my child: and she sat opposite him, and the child cried aloud and wept.
001	GEN	021	017	And God heard the voice of the child from the place where he was, and an angel of God called Agar out of heaven, and said to her, What is it, Agar? fear not, for God has heard the voice of the child from the place where he is.
001	GEN	021	018	Rise up, and take the child, and hold him in thine hand, for I will make him a great nation.
001	GEN	021	019	And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of springing water; and she went and filled the skin with water, and gave the child drink.
001	GEN	021	020	And God was with the child, and he grew and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer.
001	GEN	021	021	And he dwelt in the wilderness, and his mother took him a wife out of Pharan of Egypt.
001	GEN	021	022	And it came to pass at that time that Abimelech spoke, and Ochozath his friend, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, to Abraam, saying, God is with thee in all things, whatsoever thou mayest do.
001	GEN	021	023	Now therefore swear to me by God that thou wilt not injure me, nor my seed, nor my name, but according to the righteousness which I have performed with thee thou shalt deal with me, and with the land in which thou hast sojourned.
001	GEN	021	024	And Abraam said, I will swear.
001	GEN	021	025	And Abraam reproved Abimelech because of the wells of water, which the servants of Abimelech took away.
001	GEN	021	026	And Abimelech said to him, I know not who has done this thing to thee, neither didst thou tell it me, neither heard I it but only to-day.
001	GEN	021	027	And Abraam took sheep and calves, and gave them to Abimelech, and both made a covenant.
001	GEN	021	028	And Abraam set seven ewe-lambs by themselves.
001	GEN	021	029	And Abimelech said to Abraam, What are these seven ewe-lambs which thou hast set alone?
001	GEN	021	030	And Abraam said, Thou shalt receive the seven ewe-lambs of me, that they may be for me as a witness, that I dug this well.
001	GEN	021	031	Therefore he named the name of that place, The Well of the Oath, for there they both swore.
001	GEN	021	032	And they made a covenant at the well of the oath. And there rose up Abimelech, Ochozath his friend, and Phichol the commander-in-chief of his army, and they returned to the land of the Phylistines.
001	GEN	021	033	And Abraam planted a field at the well of the oath, and called there on the name of the Lord, the everlasting God.
001	GEN	021	034	And Abraam sojourned in the land of the Phylistines many days.
001	GEN	022	001	And it came to pass after these things that God tempted Abraam, and said to him, Abraam, Abraam; and he said, Lo! I [am here].
001	GEN	022	002	And he said, Take thy son, the beloved one, whom thou hast loved—Isaac, and go into the high land, and offer him there for a whole-burnt-offering on one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.
001	GEN	022	003	And Abraam rose up in the morning and saddled his ass, and he took with him two servants, and Isaac his son, and having split wood for a whole-burnt-offering, he arose and departed, and came to the place of which God spoke to him,
001	GEN	022	004	on the third day; and Abraam having lifted up his eyes, saw the place afar off.
001	GEN	022	005	And Abraam said to his servants, Sit ye here with the ass, and I and the lad will proceed thus far, and having worshipped we will return to you.
001	GEN	022	006	And Abraam took the wood of the whole-burnt-offering, and laid it on Isaac his son, and he took into his hands both the fire and the knife, and the two went together.
001	GEN	022	007	And Isaac said to Abraam his father, Father. And he said, What is it, son? And he said, Behold the fire and the wood, where is the sheep for a whole-burnt-offering?
001	GEN	022	008	And Abraam said, God will provide himself a sheep for a whole-burnt-offering, [my] son. And both having gone together,
001	GEN	022	009	came to the place which God spoke of to him; and there Abraam built the altar, and laid the wood on it, and having bound the feet of Isaac his son together, he laid him on the altar upon the wood.
001	GEN	022	010	And Abraam stretched forth his hand to take the knife to slay his son.
001	GEN	022	011	And an angel of the Lord called him out of heaven, and said, Abraam, Abraam. And he said, Behold, I [am here].
001	GEN	022	012	And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the child, neither do anything to him, for now I know that thou fearest God, and for my sake thou hast not spared thy beloved son.
001	GEN	022	013	And Abraam lifted up his eyes and beheld, and lo! a ram caught by his horns in a plant of Sabec; and Abraam went and took the ram, and offered him up for a whole-burnt-offering in the place of Isaac his son.
001	GEN	022	014	And Abraam called the name of that place, The Lord hath seen; that they might say to-day, In the mount the Lord was seen.
001	GEN	022	015	And an angel of the Lord called Abraam the second time out of heaven, saying, I have sworn by myself, says the Lord, because thou hast done this thing, and on my account hast not spared thy beloved son,
001	GEN	022	016	surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand which is by the shore of the sea, and thy seed shall inherit the cities of their enemies.
001	GEN	022	017	And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, because thou hast hearkened to my voice.
001	GEN	022	018	And Abraam returned to his servants, and they arose and went together to the well of the oath; and Abraam dwelt at the well of the oath.
001	GEN	022	019	And it came to pass after these things, that it was reported to Abraam, saying, Behold, Melcha herself too has born sons to Nachor thy brother,
001	GEN	022	020	Uz the first-born, and Baux his brother, and Camuel the father of the Syrians, and Chazad, and
001	GEN	022	021	Azav and Phaldes, and Jeldaph, and Bathuel, and Bathuel begot Rebecca;
001	GEN	022	022	these are eight sons, which Melcha bore to Nachor the brother of Abraam.
001	GEN	022	023	And his concubine whose name was Rheuma, she also bore Tabec, and Taam, and Tochos, and Mocha.
001	GEN	023	001	And the life of Sarrha was an hundred and twenty-seven years.
001	GEN	023	002	And Sarrha died in the city of Arboc, which is in the valley, this is Chebron in the land of Chanaan; and Abraam came to lament for Sarrha and to mourn.
001	GEN	023	003	And Abraam stood up from before his dead; and Abraam spoke to the sons of Chet, saying,
001	GEN	023	004	I am a sojourner and a stranger among you, give me therefore possession of a burying-place among you, and I will bury my dead away from me.
001	GEN	023	005	And the sons of Chet answered to Abraam, saying, Not so, Sir,
001	GEN	023	006	but hear us; thou art in the midst of us a king from God; bury thy dead in our choice sepulchres, for not one of us will by any means withhold his sepulchre from thee, so that thou shouldest not bury thy dead there.
001	GEN	023	007	And Abraam rose up and did obeisance to the people of the land, to the sons of Chet.
001	GEN	023	008	And Abraam spoke to them, saying, If ye have it in your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight, hearken to me, and speak for me to Ephron the son Saar.
001	GEN	023	009	And let him give me the double cave which he has, which is in a part of his field, let him give it me for the money it is worth for possession of a burying-place among you.
001	GEN	023	010	Now Ephron was sitting in the midst of the children of Chet, and Ephron the Chettite answered Abraam and spoke in the hearing of the sons of Chet, and of all who entered the city, saying,
001	GEN	023	011	Attend to me, my lord, and hear me, I give to thee the field and the cave which is in it; I have given it thee before all my country men; bury thy dead.
001	GEN	023	012	And Abraam did obeisance before the people of the land.
001	GEN	023	013	And he said in the ears of Ephron before the people of the land, Since thou art on my side, hear me; take the price of the field from me, and I will bury my dead there.
001	GEN	023	014	But Ephron answered Abraam, saying,
001	GEN	023	015	Nay, my lord, I have heard indeed, the land [is worth] four hundred silver didrachms, but what can this be between me and thee? nay, do thou bury thy dead.
001	GEN	023	016	And Abraam hearkened to Ephron, and Abraam rendered to Ephron the money, which he mentioned in the ears of the sons of Chet, four hundred didrachms of silver approved with merchants.
001	GEN	023	017	And the field of Ephron, which was in Double Cave, which is opposite Mambre, the field and the cave, which was in it, and every tree which was in the field, and whatever is in its borders round about, were made sure in its borders round about, were made sure
001	GEN	023	018	to Abraam for a possession, before the sons of Chet, and all that entered into the city.
001	GEN	023	019	After this Abraam buried Sarrha his wife in the Double Cave of the field, which is opposite Mambre, this is Chebron in the land of Chanaan.
001	GEN	023	020	So the field and the cave which was in it were made sure to Abraam for possession of a burying place, by the sons of Chet.
001	GEN	024	001	And Abraam was old, advanced in days, and the Lord blessed Abraam in all things.
001	GEN	024	002	And Abraam said to his servant the elder of his house, who had rule over all his possessions, Put thy hand under my thigh,
001	GEN	024	003	and I will adjure thee by the Lord the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, that thou take not a wife for my son Isaac from the daughters of the Chananites, with whom I dwell, in the midst of them.
001	GEN	024	004	But thou shalt go instead to my country, where I was born, and to my tribe, and thou shalt take from thence a wife for my son Isaac.
001	GEN	024	005	And the servant said to him, Shall I carry back thy son to the land whence thou camest forth, if haply the woman should not be willing to return with me to this land?
001	GEN	024	006	And Abraam said to him, Take heed to thyself that thou carry not my son back thither.
001	GEN	024	007	The Lord the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, who took me out of my father's house, and out of the land whence I sprang, who spoke to me, and who swore to me, saying, I will give this land to thee and to thy seed, he shall send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife to my son from thence.
001	GEN	024	008	And if the woman should not be willing to come with thee into this land, thou shalt be clear from my oath, only carry not my son thither again.
001	GEN	024	009	And the servant put his hand under the thigh of his master Abraam, and swore to him concerning this matter.
001	GEN	024	010	And the servant took ten camels of his master's camels, and [he took] of all the goods of his master with him, and he arose and went into Mesopotamia to the city of Nachor.
001	GEN	024	011	And he rested his camels without the city by the well of water towards evening, when damsels go forth to draw water.
001	GEN	024	012	And he said, O Lord God of my master Abraam, prosper my way before me to day, and deal mercifully with my master Abraam.
001	GEN	024	013	Lo! I stand by the well of water, and the daughters of them that inhabit the city come forth to draw water.
001	GEN	024	014	And it shall be, the virgin to whomsoever I shall say, Incline thy water-pot, that I may drink, and she shall say, Drink thou, and I will give thy camels drink, until they shall have done drinking—even this one thou hast prepared for thy servant Isaac, and hereby shall I know that thou hast dealt mercifully with my master Abraam.
001	GEN	024	015	And it came to pass before he had done speaking in his mind, that behold, Rebecca the daughter of Bathuel, the son of Melcha, the wife of Nachor, and [the same] the brother of Abraam, came forth, having a water-pot on her shoulders.
001	GEN	024	016	And the virgin was very beautiful in appearance, she was a virgin, a man had not known her; and she went down to the well, and filled her water-pot, and came up.
001	GEN	024	017	And the servant ran up to meet her, and said, Give me a little water to drink out of thy pitcher;
001	GEN	024	018	and she said, Drink, Sir; and she hasted, and let down the pitcher upon her arm, and gave him to drink, till he ceased drinking.
001	GEN	024	019	And she said, I will also draw water for thy camels, till they shall all have drunk.
001	GEN	024	020	And she hasted, and emptied the water-pot into the trough, and ran to the well to draw again, and drew water for all the camels.
001	GEN	024	021	And the man took great notice of her, and remained silent to know whether the Lord had made his way prosperous or not.
001	GEN	024	022	And it came to pass when all the camels ceased drinking, that the man took golden ear-rings, each of a drachm weight, and he [put] two bracelets on her hands, their weight was ten pieces of gold.
001	GEN	024	023	And he asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? Tell me if there is room for us to lodge with thy father.
001	GEN	024	024	And she said to him, I am the daughter of Bathuel the son of Melcha, whom she bore to Nachor.
001	GEN	024	025	And she said to him, We have both straw and much provender, and a place for resting.
001	GEN	024	026	And the man being well pleased, worshipped the Lord,
001	GEN	024	027	and said, Blessed be the Lord the God of my master Abraam, who has not suffered his righteousness to fail, nor his truth from my master, and the Lord has brought me prosperously to the house of the brother of my lord.
001	GEN	024	028	And the damsel ran and reported to the house of her mother according to these words.
001	GEN	024	029	And Rebecca had a brother whose name was Laban; and Laban ran out to meet the man, to the well.
001	GEN	024	030	And it came to pass when he saw the ear-rings and the bracelets on the hands of his sister, and when he heard the words of Rebecca his sister, saying, Thus the man spoke to me, that he went to the man, as he stood by the camels at the well.
001	GEN	024	031	And he said to him, Come in hither, thou blessed of the Lord, why standest thou without, whereas I have prepared the house and a place for the camels?
001	GEN	024	032	And the man entered into the house, and unloaded the camels, and gave the camels straw and provender, and water to wash his feet, and the feet of the men that were with him.
001	GEN	024	033	And he set before them loaves to eat; but he said, I will not eat, until I have told my errand. And he said, Speak on.
001	GEN	024	034	And he said, I am a servant of Abraam;
001	GEN	024	035	and the Lord has blessed my master greatly, and he is exalted, and he has given him sheep, and calves, and silver, and gold, servants and servant-maids, camels, and asses.
001	GEN	024	036	And Sarrha my master's wife bore one son to my master after he had grown old; and he gave him whatever he had.
001	GEN	024	037	And my master caused me to swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the Chananites, among whom I sojourn in their land.
001	GEN	024	038	But thou shalt go to the house of my father, and to my tribe, and thou shalt take thence a wife for my son.
001	GEN	024	039	And I said to my master, Haply the woman will not go with me.
001	GEN	024	040	And he said to me, The Lord God to whom I have been acceptable in his presence, himself shall send out his angel with thee, and shall prosper thy journey, and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my tribe, and of the house of my father.
001	GEN	024	041	Then shalt thou be clear from my curse, for whensoever thou shalt have come to my tribe, and they shall not give her to thee, then shalt thou be clear from my oath.
001	GEN	024	042	And having come this day to the well, I said, Lord God of my master Abraam, if thou prosperest my journey on which I am now going,
001	GEN	024	043	behold, I stand by the well of water, and the daughters of the men of the city come forth to draw water, and it shall be [that] the damsel to whom I shall say, Give me a little water to drink out of thy pitcher,
001	GEN	024	044	and she shall say to me, Both drink thou, and I will draw water for thy camels, this [shall be] the wife whom the Lord has prepared for his own servant Isaac; and hereby shall I know that thou hast wrought mercy with my master Abraam.
001	GEN	024	045	And it came to pass before I had done speaking in my mind, straightway Rebecca came forth, having her pitcher on her shoulders; and she went down to the well, and drew water; and I said to her, Give me to drink.
001	GEN	024	046	And she hasted and let down her pitcher on her arm from her head, and said, Drink thou, and I will give thy camels drink; and I drank, and she gave the camels drink.
001	GEN	024	047	And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? tell me; and she said, I am daughter of Bathuel the son of Nachor, whom Melcha bore to him; and I put on her the ear-rings, and the bracelets on her hands.
001	GEN	024	048	And being well-pleased I worshipped the Lord, and I blessed the Lord the God of my master Abraam, who has prospered me in a true way, so that I should take the daughter of my master's brother for his son.
001	GEN	024	049	If then ye [will] deal mercifully and justly with my lord, [tell me], and if not, tell me, that I may turn to the right hand or to the left.
001	GEN	024	050	And Laban and Bathuel answered and said, This matter has come forth from the Lord, we shall not be able to answer thee bad or good.
001	GEN	024	051	Behold, Rebecca is before thee, take her and go away, and let her be wife to the son of thy master, as the Lord has said.
001	GEN	024	052	And it came to pass when the servant of Abraam heard these words, he bowed himself to the Lord down to the earth.
001	GEN	024	053	And the servant having brought forth jewels of silver and gold and raiment, gave them to Rebecca, and gave gifts to her brother, and to her mother.
001	GEN	024	054	And both he and the men with him ate and drank and went to sleep. And he arose in the morning and said, Send me away, that I may go to my master.
001	GEN	024	055	And her brethren and her mother said, Let the virgin remain with us about ten days, and after that she shall depart.
001	GEN	024	056	But he said to them, Hinder me not, for the Lord has prospered my journey for me; send me away, that I may depart to my master.
001	GEN	024	057	And they said, Let us call the damsel, and enquire at her mouth.
001	GEN	024	058	And they called Rebecca, and said to her, Wilt thou go with this man? and she said, I will go.
001	GEN	024	059	So they sent forth Rebecca their sister, and her goods, and the servant of Abraam, and his attendants.
001	GEN	024	060	And they blessed Rebecca, and said to her, Thou art our sister; become thou thousands of myriads, and let thy seed possess the cities of their enemies.
001	GEN	024	061	And Rebecca rose up and her maidens, and they mounted the camels and went with the man; and the servant having taken up Rebecca, departed.
001	GEN	024	062	And Isaac went through the wilderness to the well of the vision, and he dwelt in the land toward the south.
001	GEN	024	063	And Isaac went forth into the plain toward evening to meditate; and having lifted up his eyes, he saw camels coming.
001	GEN	024	064	And Rebecca lifted up her eyes, and saw Isaac; and she alighted briskly from the camel,
001	GEN	024	065	and said to the servant, Who is that man that walks in the plain to meet us? And the servant said, This is my master; and she took her veil and covered herself.
001	GEN	024	066	And the servant told Isaac all that he had done.
001	GEN	024	067	And Isaac went into the house of his mother, and took Rebecca, and she became his wife, and he loved her; and Isaac was comforted for Sarrha his mother.
001	GEN	025	001	And Abraam again took a wife, whose name was Chettura.
001	GEN	025	002	And she bore to him Zombran, and Jezan, and Madal, and Madiam, and Jesboc, and Soie.
001	GEN	025	003	And Jezan begot Saba and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were the Assurians and the Latusians, and Laomim.
001	GEN	025	004	And the sons of Madiam [were] Gephar and Aphir, and Enoch, and Abeida, and Eldaga; all these were sons of Chettura.
001	GEN	025	005	But Abraam gave all his possessions to Isaac his son.
001	GEN	025	006	But to the sons of his concubines Abraam gave gifts, and he sent them away from his son Isaac, while he was yet living, to the east into the country of the east.
001	GEN	025	007	And these [were] the years of the days of the life of Abraam as many as he lived, a hundred and seventy-five years.

001	GEN	025	009	And Isaac and Ismael his sons buried him in the double cave, in the field of Ephron the son of Saar the Chettite, which is over against Mambre:
001	GEN	025	010	[even] the field and the cave which Abraam bought of the sons of Chet; there they buried Abraam and Sarrha his wife.
001	GEN	025	011	And it came to pass after Abraam was dead, that God blessed Isaac his son, and Isaac dwelt by the well of the vision.
001	GEN	025	012	And these [are] the generations of Ismael the son of Abraam, whom Agar the Egyptian the hand-maid of Sarrha bore to Abraam.
001	GEN	025	013	And these [are] the names of the sons of Ismael, according to the names of their generations. The firstborn of Ismael, Nabaioth, and Kedar, and Nabdeel, and Massam,
001	GEN	025	014	and Masma, and Duma, and Masse,
001	GEN	025	015	and Choddan, and Thaeman, and Jetur, and Naphes, and Kedma.
001	GEN	025	016	These [are] the sons of Ismael, and these are their names in their tents and in their dwellings, twelve princes according to their nations.
001	GEN	025	017	And these [are] the years of the life of Ismael, a hundred and thirty-seven years; and he failed and died, and was added to his fathers.
001	GEN	025	018	And he dwelt from Evilat to Sur, which is opposite Egypt, until one comes to the Assyrians; he dwelt in the presence of all his brethren.
001	GEN	025	019	And these [are] the generations of Isaac the son of Abraam.
001	GEN	025	020	Abraam begot Isaac. And Isaac was forty years old when he took to wife Rebecca, daughter of Bathuel the Syrian, out of Syrian Mesopotamia, sister of Laban the Syrian.
001	GEN	025	021	And Isaac prayed the Lord concerning Rebecca his wife, because she was barren; and the Lord heard him, and his wife Rebecca conceived in her womb.
001	GEN	025	022	And the babes leaped within her; and she said, If it will be so with me, why is this to me? And she went to enquire of the Lord.
001	GEN	025	023	And the Lord said to her, There are two nations in thy womb, and two peoples shall be separated from thy belly, and one people shall excel the other, and the elder shall serve the younger.
001	GEN	025	024	And the days were fulfilled that she should be delivered, and she had twins in her womb.
001	GEN	025	025	And the first came out red, hairy all over like a skin; and she called his name Esau.
001	GEN	025	026	And after this came forth his brother, and his hand took hold of the heel of Esau; and she called his name Jacob. And Isaac was sixty years old when Rebecca bore them.
001	GEN	025	027	And the lads grew, and Esau was a man skilled in hunting, dwelling in the country, and Jacob a simple man, dwelling in a house.
001	GEN	025	028	And Isaac loved Esau, because his venison was his food, but Rebecca loved Jacob.
001	GEN	025	029	And Jacob cooked pottage, and Esau came from the plain, fainting.
001	GEN	025	030	And Esau said to Jacob, Let me taste of that red pottage, because I am fainting; therefore his name was called Edom.
001	GEN	025	031	And Jacob said to Esau, Sell me this day thy birthright.
001	GEN	025	032	And Esau said, Behold, I am going to die, and for what good does this birthright [belong] to me?
001	GEN	025	033	And Jacob said to him, Swear to me this day; and he swore to him; and Esau sold his birthright to Jacob.
001	GEN	025	034	And Jacob gave bread to Esau, and pottage of lentiles; and he ate and drank, and he arose and departed; so Esau slighted his birthright.
001	GEN	026	001	And there was a famine in the land, besides the former famine, which was in the time of Abraam; and Isaac went to Abimelech the king of the Phylistines to Gerara.
001	GEN	026	002	And the Lord appeared to him and said, Go not down to Egypt, but dwell in the land, which I shall tell thee of.
001	GEN	026	003	And sojourn in this land; and I will be with thee, and bless thee, for I will give to thee and to thy seed all this land; and I will establish my oath which I swore to thy father Abraam.
001	GEN	026	004	And I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven; and I will give to thy seed all this land, and all the nations of the earth shall be blest in thy seed.
001	GEN	026	005	Because Abraam thy father hearkened to my voice, and kept my injunctions, and my commandments, and my ordinances, and my statutes.
001	GEN	026	006	And Isaac dwelt in Gerara.
001	GEN	026	007	And the men of the place questioned him concerning Rebecca his wife, and he said, She is my sister, for he feared to say, She is my wife, lest at any time the men of the place should slay him because of Rebecca, because she was fair.
001	GEN	026	008	And he remained there a long time, and Abimelech the king of Gerara leaned to look through the window, and saw Isaac sporting with Rebecca his wife.
001	GEN	026	009	And Abimelech called Isaac, and said to him, Is she then thy wife? why hast thou said, She is my sister? And Isaac said to him, [I did so], for I said, Lest at any time I die on her account.
001	GEN	026	010	And Abimelech said to him, Why hast thou done this to us? one of my kindred within a little had lain with thy wife, and thou wouldest have brought [a sin of] ignorance upon us.
001	GEN	026	011	And Abimelech charged all his people, saying Every man that touches this man and his wife shall be liable to death.
001	GEN	026	012	And Isaac sowed in that land, and he found in that year barley and hundred-fold, and the Lord blessed him.
001	GEN	026	013	And the man was exalted, and advancing he increased, till he became very great.
001	GEN	026	014	And he had cattle of sheep, and cattle of oxen, and many tilled lands, and the Phylistines envied him.
001	GEN	026	015	And all the wells which the servants of his father had dug in the time of his father, the Phylistines stopped them, and filled them with earth.
001	GEN	026	016	And Abimelech said to Isaac, Depart from us, for thou art become much mightier than we.
001	GEN	026	017	And Isaac departed thence, and rested in the valley of Gerara, and dwelt there.
001	GEN	026	018	And Isaac dug again the wells of water, which the servants of his father Abraam had dug, and the Phylistines had stopped them, after the death of his father Abraam; and he gave them names, according to the names by which his father named them.
001	GEN	026	019	And the servants of Isaac dug in the valley of Gerara, and they found there a well of living water.
001	GEN	026	020	And the shepherds of Gerara strove with the shepherds of Isaac, saying that the water was theirs; and they called the name of the well, Injury, for they injured him.
001	GEN	026	021	And having departed thence he dug another well, and they strove also for that; and he named the name of it, Enmity.
001	GEN	026	022	And he departed thence and dug another well; and they did not strive about that; and he named the name of it, Room, saying, Because now the Lord has made room for us, and has increased us upon the earth.
001	GEN	026	023	And he went up thence to the well of the oath.
001	GEN	026	024	And the Lord appeared to him in that night, and said, I am the God of Abraam thy father; fear not, for I am with thee, and I will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for the sake of Abraam thy father.
001	GEN	026	025	And he built there an altar, and called on the name of the Lord, and there he pitched his tent, and there the servants of Isaac dug a well in the valley of Gerara.
001	GEN	026	026	And Abimelech came to him from Gerara, and so did Ochozath his friend, and Phichol the commander-in-chief of his army.
001	GEN	026	027	And Isaac said to them, Wherefore have ye come to me? whereas ye hated me, and sent me away from you.
001	GEN	026	028	And they said, We have surely seen that the Lord was with thee, and we said, Let there be an oath between us and thee, and we will make a covenant with thee,
001	GEN	026	029	that thou shalt do no wrong by us, as we have not abhorred thee, and according as we have treated thee well, and have sent thee forth peaceably; and now thou art blessed of the Lord.
001	GEN	026	030	And he made a feast for them, and they ate and drank.
001	GEN	026	031	And they arose in the morning, and swore each to his neighbour; and Isaac sent them forth, and they departed from him in safety.
001	GEN	026	032	And it came to pass in that day, that the servants of Isaac came and told him of the well which they had dug; and they said, We have not found water.
001	GEN	026	033	And he called it, Oath: therefore he called the name of that city, the Well of Oath, until this day.
001	GEN	026	034	And Esau was forty years old; and he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beoch the Chettite, and Basemath, daughter of Helon the Chettite.
001	GEN	026	035	And they were provoking to Isaac and Rebecca.
001	GEN	027	001	And it came to pass after Isaac was old, that his eyes were dimmed so that he could not see; and he called Esau, his elder son, and said to him, My son; and he said, Behold, I [am here].
001	GEN	027	002	And he said, Behold, I am grown old, and know not the day of my death.
001	GEN	027	003	Now then take the weapons, both thy quiver and thy bow, and go into the plain, and get me venison,
001	GEN	027	004	and make me meats, as I like them, and bring them to me that I may eat, that my soul may bless thee, before I die.
001	GEN	027	005	And Rebecca heard Isaac speaking to Esau his son; and Esau went to the plain to procure venison for his father.
001	GEN	027	006	And Rebecca said to Jacob her younger son, Behold, I heard thy father speaking to Esau thy brother, saying,
001	GEN	027	007	Bring me venison, and prepare me meats, that I may eat and bless thee before the Lord before I die.
001	GEN	027	008	Now then, my son, hearken to me, as I command thee.
001	GEN	027	009	And go to the cattle and take for me thence two kids, tender and good, and I will make them meats for thy father, as he likes.
001	GEN	027	010	And thou shalt bring them in to thy father, and he shall eat, that thy father may bless thee before he dies.
001	GEN	027	011	And Jacob said to his mother Rebecca, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I a smooth man.
001	GEN	027	012	Peradventure my father may feel me, and I shall be before him as one ill-intentioned, and I shall bring upon me a curse, and not a blessing.
001	GEN	027	013	And his mother said to him, On me be thy curse, son; only hearken to my voice, and go and bring [them] me.
001	GEN	027	014	So he went and took and brought them to his mother; and his mother made meats, as his father liked [them].
001	GEN	027	015	And Rebecca having taken the fine raiment of her elder son Esau which was with her in the house, put it on Jacob her younger son.
001	GEN	027	016	And she put on his arms the skins of the kids, and on the bare parts of his neck.
001	GEN	027	017	And she gave the meats, and the loaves which she had prepared, into the hands of Jacob her son.
001	GEN	027	018	And he brought [them] to his father, and said, Father; and he said, Behold I [am here]; who art thou, son?
001	GEN	027	019	And Jacob said to his father, I, Esau thy first-born, have done as thou toldest me; rise, sit, and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me.
001	GEN	027	020	And Isaac said to his son, What is this which thou hast quickly found? And he said, That which the Lord thy God presented before me.
001	GEN	027	021	And Isaac said to Jacob, Draw night to me, and I will feel thee, son, if thou art my son Esau or not.
001	GEN	027	022	And Jacob drew nigh to his father Isaac, and he felt him, and said, The voice [is] Jacob's voice, but the hands [are] the hands of Esau.
001	GEN	027	023	And he knew him not, for his hands were as the hands of his brother Esau, hairy; and he blessed him,
001	GEN	027	024	and he said, Art thou my son Esau? and he said, I [am].
001	GEN	027	025	And he said, Bring hither, and I will eat of thy venison, son, that my soul may bless thee; and he brought [it] near to him, and he ate, and he brought him wine, and he drank.
001	GEN	027	026	And Isaac his father said to him, Draw nigh to me, and kiss me, son.
001	GEN	027	027	And he drew nigh and kissed him, and smelled the smell of his garments, and blessed him, and said, Behold, the smell of my son is as the smell of an abundant field, which the Lord has blessed.
001	GEN	027	028	And may God give thee of the dew of heaven, and of the fatness of the earth, and abundance of corn and wine.
001	GEN	027	029	And let nations serve thee, and princes bow down to thee, and be thou lord of thy brother, and the sons of thy father shall do thee reverence; accursed is he that curses thee, and blessed is he that blesses thee.
001	GEN	027	030	And it came to pass after Isaac had ceased blessing his son Jacob, it even came to pass, just when Jacob had gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.
001	GEN	027	031	And he also had made meats and brought them to his father; and he said to his father, Let my father arise and eat of his son's venison, that thy soul may bless me.
001	GEN	027	032	And Isaac his father said to him, Who art thou? And he said, I am thy first-born son Esau.
001	GEN	027	033	And Isaac was amazed with very great amazement, and said, Who then is it that has procured venison for me and brought it to me? and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and I have blessed him, and he shall be blessed.
001	GEN	027	034	And it came to pass when Esau heard the words of his father Isaac, he cried out with a great and very bitter cry, and said, Bless, I pray thee, me also, father.
001	GEN	027	035	And he said to him, Thy brother has come with subtlety, and taken thy blessing.
001	GEN	027	036	And he said, Rightly was his name called Jacob, for lo! this second time has he supplanted me; he has both taken my birthright, and now he has taken my blessing; and Esau said to his father, Hast thou not left a blessing for me, father?
001	GEN	027	037	And Isaac answered and said to Esau, If I have made him thy lord, and have made all his brethren his servants, and have strengthened him with corn and wine, what then shall I do for thee, son?
001	GEN	027	038	And Esau said to his father, Hast thou [only] one blessing, father? Bless, I pray thee, me also, father. And Isaac being troubled, Esau cried aloud and wept.
001	GEN	027	039	And Isaac his father answered and said to him, Behold, thy dwelling shall be of the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above.
001	GEN	027	040	And thou shalt live by thy sword, and shalt serve thy brother; and there shall be [a time] when thou shalt break and loosen his yoke from off thy neck.
001	GEN	027	041	And Esau was angry with Jacob because of the blessing, with which his father blessed him; and Esau said in his mind, Let the days of my father's mourning draw nigh, that I may slay my brother Jacob.
001	GEN	027	042	And the words of Esau her elder son were reported to Rebecca, and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said to him, Behold, Esau thy brother threatens thee to kill thee.
001	GEN	027	043	Now then, my son, hear my voice, and rise and depart quickly into Mesopotamia to Laban my brother into Charran.
001	GEN	027	044	And dwell with him certain days, until thy brother's anger
001	GEN	027	045	and rage depart from thee, and he forget what thou hast done to him; and I will send and fetch thee thence, lest at any time I should be bereaved of you both in one day.
001	GEN	027	046	And Rebecca said to Isaac, I am weary of my life, because of the daughters of the sons of Chet; if Jacob shall take a wife of the daughters of this land, wherefore should I live?
001	GEN	028	001	And Isaac having called for Jacob, blessed him, and charged him, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of the Chananites.
001	GEN	028	002	Rise and depart quickly into Mesopotamia, to the house of Bathuel the father of thy mother, and take to thyself thence a wife of the daughters of Laban thy mother's brother.
001	GEN	028	003	And may my God bless thee, and increase thee, and multiply thee, and thou shalt become gatherings of nations.
001	GEN	028	004	And may he give thee the blessing of my father Abraam, even to thee and to thy seed after thee, to inherit the land of thy sojourning, which God gave to Abraam.
001	GEN	028	005	So Isaac sent away Jacob, and he went into Mesopotamia to Laban the son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebecca the mother of Jacob and Esau.
001	GEN	028	006	And Esau saw that Isaac blessed Jacob, and sent him away to Mesopotamia of Syria as he blessed him, to take to himself a wife thence, and [that] he charged him, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of the Chananites;
001	GEN	028	007	and [that] Jacob hearkened to his father and his mother, and went to Mesopotamia of Syria.
001	GEN	028	008	And Esau also having seen that the daughters of Chanaan were evil before his father Isaac,
001	GEN	028	009	Esau went to Ismael, and took Maeleth the daughter of Ismael, the son of Abraam, the sister of Nabeoth, a wife in addition to his [other] wives.
001	GEN	028	010	And Jacob went forth from the well of the oath, and departed into Charrhan.
001	GEN	028	011	And came to a certain place and slept there, for the sun had gone down; and he took [one] of the stones of the place, and put it at his head, and lay down to sleep in that place,
001	GEN	028	012	and dreamed, and behold a ladder fixed on the earth, whose top reached to heaven, and the angels of God ascended and descended on it.
001	GEN	028	013	And the Lord stood upon it, and said, I am the God of thy father Abraam, and the God of Isaac; fear not, the land on which thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed.
001	GEN	028	014	And thy seed shall be as the sand of the earth; and it shall spread abroad to the sea, and the south, and the north, and to the east; and in thee and in thy seed shall all the tribes of the earth be blessed.
001	GEN	028	015	And behold I am with thee to preserve thee continually in all the way wherein thou shalt go; and I will bring thee back to this land; for I will not desert thee, until I have done all that I have said to thee.
001	GEN	028	016	And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and said, The Lord is in this place, and I knew it not.
001	GEN	028	017	And he was afraid, and said, How fearful is this place! this is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.
001	GEN	028	018	And Jacob rose up in the morning, and took the stone he [had] laid there by his head, and he set it up [as] a pillar, and poured oil on the top of it.
001	GEN	028	019	And he called the name of that place, the House of God; and the name of the city before was Ulam-luz.
001	GEN	028	020	And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If the Lord God will be with me, and guard me throughout on this journey, on which I am going, and give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on,
001	GEN	028	021	and bring me back in safety to the house of my father, then shall the Lord be for a God to me.
001	GEN	028	022	And this stone, which I have set up for a pillar, shall be to me a house of God; and of all whatsoever thou shalt give me, I will tithe a tenth for thee.
001	GEN	029	001	And Jacob started and went to the land of the east to Laban, the son of Bathuel the Syrian, and the brother of Rebecca, mother of Jacob and Esau.
001	GEN	029	002	And he looks, and behold! a well in the plain; and there were there three flocks of sheep resting at it, for out of that well they watered the flocks, but there was a great stone at the mouth of the well.
001	GEN	029	003	And there were all the flocks gathered, and they used to roll away the stone from the mouth of the well, and water the flocks, and set the stone again in its place on the mouth of the well.
001	GEN	029	004	And Jacob said to them, Brethren, whence are ye? and they said, We are of Charrhan.
001	GEN	029	005	And he said to them, Know ye Laban, the son of Nachor? and they said, We do know [him].
001	GEN	029	006	And he said to them, Is he well? And they said, He is well. And behold Rachel his daughter came with the sheep.
001	GEN	029	007	And Jacob said, it is yet high day, it is not yet time that the flocks be gathered together; water ye the flocks, and depart and feed them.
001	GEN	029	008	And they said, We shall not be able, until all the shepherds be gathered together, and they shall roll away the stone from the mouth of the well, then we will water the flocks.
001	GEN	029	009	While he was yet speaking to them, behold, Rachel the daughter of Laban came with her father's sheep, for she fed the sheep of her father.
001	GEN	029	010	And it came to pass when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban, his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban, his mother's brother, that Jacob came and rolled away the stone from the mouth of the well, and watered the sheep of Laban, his mother's brother.
001	GEN	029	011	And Jacob kissed Rachel, and cried with a loud voice and wept.
001	GEN	029	012	And he told Rachel that he was the near relative of her father, and the son of Rebecca; and she ran and reported to her father according to these words.
001	GEN	029	013	And it came to pass when Laban heard the name of Jacob, his sister's son, he ran to meet him, and embraced and kissed him, and brought him into his house; and he told Laban all these sayings.
001	GEN	029	014	And Laban said to him, Thou art of my bones and of my flesh; and he was with him a full month.
001	GEN	029	015	And Laban said to Jacob, Surely thou shalt not serve me for nothing, because thou art my brother; tell me what thy reward is to be.
001	GEN	029	016	Now Laban had two daughters, the name of the elder was Lea, and the name of the younger, Rachel.
001	GEN	029	017	And the eyes of Lea were weak. But Rachel was beautiful in appearance, and exceedingly fair in countenance.
001	GEN	029	018	And Jacob loved Rachel, and said, I will serve thee seven years for thy younger daughter Rachel.
001	GEN	029	019	And Laban said to him, [It is] better that I should give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man; dwell with me.
001	GEN	029	020	And Jacob served for Rachel seven years, and they were before him as a few days, by reason of his loving her.
001	GEN	029	021	And Jacob said to Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in to her.
001	GEN	029	022	And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a marriage-feast.
001	GEN	029	023	And it was even, and he took his daughter Lea, and brought her in to Jacob, and Jacob went in to her.
001	GEN	029	024	And Laban gave to his daughter Lea, Zelpha his handmaid, as a handmaid for her.
001	GEN	029	025	And it was morning, and behold it was Lea; and Jacob said to Laban, What is this that thou hast done to me? did I not serve thee for Rachel? and wherefore hast thou deceived me?
001	GEN	029	026	And Laban answered, It is not done thus in our country, to give the younger before the elder.
001	GEN	029	027	Fulfil then her sevens, and I will give to thee her also in return for thy labour, which thou labourest with me, yet seven other years.
001	GEN	029	028	And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her sevens; and Laban gave him his daughter Rachel to wife.
001	GEN	029	029	And Laban gave to his daughter his handmaid Balla, for a handmaid to her.
001	GEN	029	030	And he went in to Rachel; and he loved Rachel more than Lea; and he served him seven other years.
001	GEN	029	031	And when the Lord God saw that Lea was hated, he opened her womb; but Rachel was barren.
001	GEN	029	032	And Lea conceived and bore a son to Jacob; and she called his name, Ruben; saying, Because the Lord has looked on my humiliation, and has given me a son, now then my husband will love me.
001	GEN	029	033	And she conceived again, and bore a second son to Jacob; and she said, Because the Lord has heard that I am hated, he has given to me this one also; and she called his name, Simeon.
001	GEN	029	034	And she conceived yet again, and bore a son, and said, In the present time my husband will be with me, for I have born him three sons; therefore she called his name, Levi.
001	GEN	029	035	And having conceived yet again, she bore a son, and said, Now yet again this time will I give thanks to the Lord; therefore she called his name, Juda; and ceased bearing.
001	GEN	030	001	And Rachel having perceived that she bore Jacob no children, was jealous of her sister; and said to Jacob, Give me children; and if not, I shall die.
001	GEN	030	002	And Jacob was angry with Rachel, and said to her, Am I in the place of God, who has deprived thee of the fruit of the womb?
001	GEN	030	003	And Rachel said to Jacob, Behold my handmaid Balla, go in to her, and she shall bear upon my knees, and I also shall have children by her.
001	GEN	030	004	And she gave him Balla her maid, for a wife to him; and Jacob went in to her.
001	GEN	030	005	And Balla, Rachel's maid, conceived, and bore Jacob a son.
001	GEN	030	006	And Rachel said, God has given judgment for me, and hearkened to my voice, and has given me a son; therefore she called his name, Dan.
001	GEN	030	007	And Balla, Rachel's maid, conceived yet again, and bore a second son to Jacob.
001	GEN	030	008	And Rachel said, God has helped me, and I contended with my sister and prevailed; and she called his name, Nephthalim.
001	GEN	030	009	And Lea saw that she ceased from bearing, and she took Zelpha her maid, and gave her to Jacob for a wife; and he went in to her.
001	GEN	030	010	And Zelpha the maid of Lea conceived, and bore Jacob a son.
001	GEN	030	011	And Lea said, [It is] happily: and she called his name, Gad.
001	GEN	030	012	And Zelpha the maid of Lea conceived yet again, and bore Jacob a second son.
001	GEN	030	013	And Lea said, I am blessed, for the women will pronounce me blessed; and she called his name, Aser.
001	GEN	030	014	And Ruben went in the day of barley-harvest, and found apples of mandrakes in the field, and brought them to his mother Lea; and Rachel said to Lea her sister, Give me of thy son's mandrakes.
001	GEN	030	015	And Lea said, [Is it] not enough for thee that thou hast taken my husband, wilt thou also take my son's mandrakes? And Rachel said, Not so: let him lie with thee to-night for thy son's mandrakes.
001	GEN	030	016	And Jacob came in out of the field at even; and Lea went forth to meet him, and said, Thou shalt come in to me this day, for I have hired thee for my son's mandrakes; and he lay with her that night.
001	GEN	030	017	And God hearkened to Lea, and she conceived, and bore Jacob a fifth son.
001	GEN	030	018	And Lea said, God has given me my reward, because I gave my maid to my husband; and she called his name Issachar, which is, Reward.
001	GEN	030	019	And Lea conceived again, and bore Jacob a sixth son.
001	GEN	030	020	And Lea said, God has given me a good gift in this time; my husband will choose me, for I have born him six sons: and she called his name, Zabulon.
001	GEN	030	021	And after this she bore a daughter; and she called her name, Dina.
001	GEN	030	022	And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and he opened her womb.
001	GEN	030	023	And she conceived, and bore Jacob a son; and Rachel said, God has taken away my reproach.
001	GEN	030	024	And she called his name Joseph, saying, Let God add to me another son.
001	GEN	030	025	And it came to pass when Rachel had born Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, Send me away, that I may go to my place and to my land.
001	GEN	030	026	Restore my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee, that I may depart, for thou knowest the service wherewith I have served thee.
001	GEN	030	027	And Laban said to him, If I have found grace in thy sight, I would augur [well], for the Lord has blessed me at thy coming in.
001	GEN	030	028	Appoint me thy wages, and I will give [them].
001	GEN	030	029	And Jacob said, Thou knowest in what things I have served thee, and how many cattle of thine are with me.
001	GEN	030	030	For it was little thou hadst before my time, and it is increased to a multitude, and the Lord God has blessed thee since my coming; now then, when shall I set up also my own house?
001	GEN	030	031	And Laban said to him, What shall I give thee? and Jacob said to him, Thou shalt not give me anything; if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again tend thy flocks and keep them.
001	GEN	030	032	Let all thy sheep pass by to-day, and separate thence every grey sheep among the rams, and every one that is speckled and spotted among the goats—[this] shall be my reward.
001	GEN	030	033	And my righteousness shall answer for me on the morrow, for it is my reward before thee: whatever shall not be spotted and speckled among the goats, and grey among the rams, shall be stolen with me.
001	GEN	030	034	And Laban said to him, Let it be according to thy word.
001	GEN	030	035	And he separated in that day the spotted and speckled he-goats, and all the spotted and speckled she-goats, and all that was grey among the rams, and every one that was white among them, and he gave them into the hand of his sons.
001	GEN	030	036	And he set a distance of a three days' journey between them and Jacob. And Jacob tended the cattle of Laban that were left behind.
001	GEN	030	037	And Jacob took to himself green rods of storax tree and walnut and plane-tree; and Jacob peeled in them white stripes; and as he drew off the green, the white stripe which he had made appeared alternate on the rods.
001	GEN	030	038	And he laid the rods which he had peeled, in the hollows of the watering-troughs, that whensoever the cattle should come to drink, as they should have come to drink before the rods, the cattle might conceive at the rods.
001	GEN	030	039	So the cattle conceived at the rods, and the cattle brought forth [young] speckled, and streaked and spotted with ash-coloured [spots].
001	GEN	030	040	And Jacob separated the lambs, and set before the sheep a speckled ram, and every variegated one among the lambs, and he separated flocks for himself alone, and did not mingle them with the sheep of Laban.
001	GEN	030	041	And it came to pass in the time wherein the cattle became pregnant, conceiving in the belly, Jacob put the rods before the cattle in the troughs, that they might conceive by the rods.
001	GEN	030	042	But he did not put them in [indiscriminately] whenever the cattle happened to bring forth, but the unmarked ones were Laban's, and the marked ones were Jacob's.
001	GEN	030	043	And the man became very rich, and he had many cattle, and oxen, and servants, and maid-servants, and camels, and asses.
001	GEN	031	001	And Jacob heard the words of the sons of Laban, saying, Jacob has taken all that was our father's, and of our father's property has he gotten all this glory.
001	GEN	031	002	And Jacob saw the countenance of Laban, and behold it was not toward him as before.
001	GEN	031	003	And the Lord said to Jacob, Return to the land of thy father, and to thy family, and I will be with thee.
001	GEN	031	004	And Jacob sent and called Lea and Rachel to the plain where the flocks were.
001	GEN	031	005	And he said to them, I see the face of your father, that it is not toward me as before, but the God of my father was with me.
001	GEN	031	006	And ye too know that with all my might I have served your father.
001	GEN	031	007	But your father deceived me, and changed my wages for the ten lambs, yet God gave him not [power] to hurt me.
001	GEN	031	008	If he should say thus, The speckled shall be thy reward, then all the cattle would bear speckled; and if he should say, The white shall be thy reward, then would all the cattle bear white.
001	GEN	031	009	So God has taken away all the cattle of your father, and given them to me.
001	GEN	031	010	And it came to pass when the cattle conceived and were with young, that I beheld with mine eyes in sleep, and behold the he-goats and the rams leaping on the sheep and the she-goats, speckled and variegated and spotted with ash-coloured spots.
001	GEN	031	011	And the angel of God said to me in a dream, Jacob; and I said, What is it?
001	GEN	031	012	And he said, Look up with thine eyes, and behold the he-goats and the rams leaping on the sheep and the she-goats, speckled and variegated and spotted with ash-coloured spots; for I have seen all things that Laban does to thee.
001	GEN	031	013	I am God that appeared to thee in the place of God where thou anointedst a pillar to me, and vowedst to me there a vow; now then arise and depart out of this land, depart into the land of thy nativity, and I will be with thee.
001	GEN	031	014	And Rachel and Lea answered and said to him, Have we yet a part or inheritance in the house of our father?
001	GEN	031	015	Are we not considered strangers by him? for he has sold us, and quite devoured our money.
001	GEN	031	016	All the wealth and the glory which God has taken from our father, it shall be our's and our children's; now then do whatsoever God has said to thee.
001	GEN	031	017	And Jacob arose and took his wives and his children up on the camels;
001	GEN	031	018	and he took away all his possessions and all his store, which he had gotten in Mesopotamia, and all that belonged to him, to depart to Isaac his father in the land of Chanaan.
001	GEN	031	019	And Laban went to shear his sheep; and Rachel stole her father's images.
001	GEN	031	020	And Jacob hid [the matter from] Laban the Syrian, so as not to tell him that he ran away.
001	GEN	031	021	And he departed himself and all that belonged to him, and passed over the river, and went into the mountain Galaad.
001	GEN	031	022	But it was told Laban the Syrian on the third day, that Jacob was fled.
001	GEN	031	023	And having taken his brethren with him, he pursued after him seven days' journey, and overtook him on Mount Galaad.
001	GEN	031	024	And God came to Laban the Syrian in sleep by night, and said to him, Take heed to thyself that thou speak not at any time to Jacob evil things.
001	GEN	031	025	And Laban overtook Jacob; and Jacob pitched his tent in the mountain; and Laban stationed his brothers in the mount Galaad.
001	GEN	031	026	And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done? wherefore didst thou run away secretly, and pillage me, and lead away my daughters as captives taken with the sword?
001	GEN	031	027	Whereas if thou hadst told me, I would have sent thee away with mirth, and with songs, and timbrels, and harp.
001	GEN	031	028	And I was not counted worthy to embrace my children and my daughters; now then thou hast wrought foolishly.
001	GEN	031	029	And now my hand has power to hurt thee; but the God of thy father spoke to me yesterday, saying, Take heed to thyself that thou speak not evil words to Jacob.
001	GEN	031	030	Now then go on thy way, for thou hast earnestly desired to depart to the house of thy father; wherefore hast thou stolen my gods?
001	GEN	031	031	And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid; for I said, Lest at any time thou shouldest take away thy daughters from me, and all my possessions.
001	GEN	031	032	And Jacob said, With whomsoever thou shalt find thy gods, he shall not live in the presence of our brethren; take notice of what I have of thy property, and take it; and he observed nothing with him, but Jacob knew not that his wife Rachel had stolen them.
001	GEN	031	033	And Laban went in and searched in the house of Lea, and found [them] not; and he went out of the house of Lea, and searched in the house of Jacob, and in the house of the two maid-servants, and found them not; and he went also into the house of Rachel.
001	GEN	031	034	And Rachel took the idols, and cast them among the camel's packs, and sat upon them.
001	GEN	031	035	And she said to her father, Be not indignant, Sir; I cannot rise up before thee, for it is with me according to the manner of women. Laban searched in all the house, and found not the images.
001	GEN	031	036	And Jacob was angry, and strove with Laban; and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my injustice, and what my sin, that thou hast pursued after me,
001	GEN	031	037	and that thou hast searched all the furniture of my house? what hast thou found of all the furniture of thine house? set it here between thy relations and my relations, and let them decide between us two.
001	GEN	031	038	These twenty years have I been with thee; thy sheep, and thy she-goats have not failed in bearing; I devoured not the rams of thy cattle.
001	GEN	031	039	That which was taken of beasts I brought not to thee; I made good of myself the thefts of the day, and the thefts of the night.
001	GEN	031	040	I was parched with heat by day, and [chilled] with frost by night, and my sleep departed from my eyes.
001	GEN	031	041	These twenty years have I been in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years among thy sheep, and thou didst falsely rate my wages for ten lambs.
001	GEN	031	042	Unless I had the God of my father Abraam, and the fear of Isaac, now thou wouldest have sent me away empty; God saw my humiliation, and the labour of my hands, and rebuked thee yesterday.
001	GEN	031	043	And Laban answered and said to Jacob, The daughters are my daughters, and the sons my sons, and the cattle are my cattle, and all things which thou seest are mine, and [the property] of my daughters; what shall I do to them to-day, or their children which they bore?
001	GEN	031	044	Now then come, let me make a covenant, both I and thou, and it shall be for a witness between me and thee; and he said to him, Behold, there is no one with us; behold, God is witness between me and thee.
001	GEN	031	045	And Jacob having taken a stone, set it up for a pillar.
001	GEN	031	046	And Jacob said to his brethren, Gather stones; and they gathered stones and made a heap, and ate there upon the heap; and Laban said to him, This heap witnesses between me and thee to-day.
001	GEN	031	047	And Laban called it, the Heap of Testimony; and Jacob called it, the Witness Heap.
001	GEN	031	048	And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and the pillar, which I have set between me and thee; this heap witnesses, and this pillar witnesses; therefore its name was called, the Heap witnesses.
001	GEN	031	049	And the vision of which he said—Let God look to it between me and thee, because we are about to depart from each other, —
001	GEN	031	050	If thou shalt humble my daughters, if thou shouldest take wives in addition to my daughters, see, there is no one with us looking on. God [is] witness between me and thee.
001	GEN	031	051	And Laban said to Jacob, Behold, this heap, and this pillar are a witness.
001	GEN	031	052	For if I should not cross over unto thee, neither shouldest thou cross over to me, for mischief beyond this heap and this pillar.
001	GEN	031	053	The God of Abraam and the God of Nachor judge between us; and Jacob swore by the Fear of his father Isaac.
001	GEN	031	054	And he offered a sacrifice in the mountain, and called his brethren, and they ate and drank, and slept in the mountain.
001	GEN	031	055	And Laban rose up in the morning, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them; and Laban having turned back, departed to his place.
001	GEN	032	001	And Jacob departed for his journey; and having looked up, he saw the host of God encamped; and the angels of God met him.
001	GEN	032	002	And Jacob said, when he saw them, This is the Camp of God; and he called the name of that place, Encampments.
001	GEN	032	003	And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother to the land of Seir, to the country of Edom.
001	GEN	032	004	And he charged them, saying, Thus shall ye say to my lord Esau: Thus saith thy servant Jacob; I have sojourned with Laban and tarried until now.
001	GEN	032	005	And there were born to me oxen, and asses, and sheep, and men-servants and women-servants; and I sent to tell my lord Esau, that thy servant might find grace in thy sight.
001	GEN	032	006	And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and lo! he comes to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.
001	GEN	032	007	And Jacob was greatly terrified, and was perplexed; and he divided the people that was with him, and the cows, and the camels, and the sheep, into two camps.
001	GEN	032	008	And Jacob said, If Esau should come to one camp, and smite it, the other camp shall be in safety.
001	GEN	032	009	And Jacob said, God of my father Abraam, and God of my father Isaac, O Lord, thou [art] he that said to me, Depart quickly to the land of thy birth, and I will do thee good.
001	GEN	032	010	Let there be to me a sufficiency of all the justice and all the truth which thou hast wrought with thy servant; for with this my staff I passed over this Jordan, and now I am become two camps.
001	GEN	032	011	Deliver me from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau, for I am afraid of him, lest haply he should come and smite me, and the mother upon the children.
001	GEN	032	012	But thou saidst, I will do thee good, and will make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which shall not be numbered for multitude.
001	GEN	032	013	And he slept there that night, and took of the gifts which he carried [with him], and sent out to Esau his brother,
001	GEN	032	014	two hundred she-goats, twenty he-goats, two hundred sheep, twenty rams,
001	GEN	032	015	milch camels, and their foals, thirty, forty kine, ten bulls, twenty asses, and ten colts.
001	GEN	032	016	And he gave them to his servants [each] drove apart; and he said to his servants, Go on before me, and put a space between drove and drove.
001	GEN	032	017	And he charged the first, saying, If Esau my brother meet thee, and he ask thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither wouldest thou go, and whose are these possessions advancing before thee?
001	GEN	032	018	Thou shalt say, Thy servant Jacob's; he hath sent gifts to my lord Esau, and lo! he is behind us.
001	GEN	032	019	And he charged the first and the second and the third, and all that went before him after these flocks, saying, Thus shall ye speak to Esau when ye find him;
001	GEN	032	020	and ye shall say, Behold thy servant Jacob comes after us. For he said, I will propitiate his countenance with the gifts going before his presence, and afterwards I will behold his face, for peradventure he will accept me.
001	GEN	032	021	So the presents went on before him, but he himself lodged that night in the camp.
001	GEN	032	022	And he rose up in that night, and took his two wives and his two servant-maids, and his eleven children, and crossed over the ford of Jaboch.
001	GEN	032	023	And he took them, and passed over the torrent, and brought over all his possessions.
001	GEN	032	024	And Jacob was left alone; and a man wrestled with him till the morning.
001	GEN	032	025	And he saw that he prevailed not against him; and he touched the broad part of his thigh, and the broad part of Jacob's thigh was benumbed in his wrestling with him.
001	GEN	032	026	And he said to him, Let me go, for the day has dawned; but he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.
001	GEN	032	027	And he said to him, What is thy name? and he answered, Jacob.
001	GEN	032	028	And he said to him, Thy name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name; for thou hast prevailed with God, and shalt be mighty with men.
001	GEN	032	029	And Jacob asked and said, Tell me thy name; and he said, Wherefore dost thou ask after my name? and he blessed him there.
001	GEN	032	030	And Jacob called the name of that place, the Face of God; for, [said he,]I have seen God face to face, and my life was preserved.
001	GEN	032	031	And the sun rose upon him, when he passed the Face of God; and he halted upon his thigh.
001	GEN	032	032	Therefore the children of Israel will by no means eat of the sinew which was benumbed, which is on the broad part of the thigh, until this day, because [the angel] touched the broad part of the thigh of Jacob—[even] the sinew which was benumbed.
001	GEN	033	001	And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and beheld, and lo! Esau his brother coming, and four hundred men with him; and Jacob divided the children to Lea and to Rachel, and the two handmaidens.
001	GEN	033	002	And he put the two handmaidens and their children with the first, and Lea and her children behind, and Rachel and Joseph last.
001	GEN	033	003	But he advanced himself before them, and did reverence to the ground seven times, until he drew near to his brother.
001	GEN	033	004	And Esau ran on to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him; and they both wept.
001	GEN	033	005	And Esau looked up and saw the women and the children, and said, What are these to thee? And he said, The children with which God has mercifully blessed thy servant.
001	GEN	033	006	And the maid-servants and their children drew near and did reverence.
001	GEN	033	007	And Lea and her children drew near and did reverence; and after this drew near Rachel and Joseph, and did reverence.
001	GEN	033	008	And he said, What are these things to thee, all these companies that I have met? And he said, That thy servant might find grace in thy sight, my lord.
001	GEN	033	009	And Esau said, I have much, my brother; keep thine own.
001	GEN	033	010	And Jacob said, If I have found grace in thy sight, receive the gifts through my hands; therefore have I seen thy face, as if any one should see the face of God, and thou shalt be well-pleased with me.
001	GEN	033	011	Receive my blessings, which I have brought thee, because God has had mercy on me, and I have all things; and he constrained him, and he took [them].
001	GEN	033	012	And he said, Let us depart, and proceed right onward.
001	GEN	033	013	And he said to him, My lord knows, that the children are very tender, and the flocks and the herds with me are with young; if then I shall drive them hard one day, all the cattle will die.
001	GEN	033	014	Let my lord go on before his servant, and I shall have strength on the road according to the ease of the journey before me, and according to the strength of the children, until I come to my lord to Seir.
001	GEN	033	015	And Esau said, I will leave with thee some of the people who are with me. And he said, Why so? it is enough that I have found favour before thee, [my] lord.
001	GEN	033	016	And Esau returned on that day on his journey to Seir.
001	GEN	033	017	And Jacob departs to his tents; and he made for himself there habitations, and for his cattle he made booths; therefore he called the name of that place, Booths.
001	GEN	033	018	And Jacob came to Salem, a city of Secima, which is in the land of Chanaan, when he departed out of Mesopotamia of Syria, and took up a position in front of the city.
001	GEN	033	019	And he bought the portion of the field, where he pitched his tent, of Emmor the father of Sychem, for a hundred lambs.
001	GEN	033	020	And he set up there an altar, and called on the God of Israel.
001	GEN	034	001	And Dina, the daughter of Lea, whom she bore to Jacob, went forth to observe the daughters of the inhabitants.
001	GEN	034	002	And Sychem the son of Emmor the Evite, the ruler of the land, saw her, and took her and lay with her, and humbled her.
001	GEN	034	003	And he was attached to the soul of Dina the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and he spoke kindly to the damsel.
001	GEN	034	004	Sychem spoke to Emmor his father, saying, Take for me this damsel to wife.
001	GEN	034	005	And Jacob heard that the son of Emmor had defiled Dina his daughter (now his sons were with his cattle in the plain). And Jacob was silent until they came.
001	GEN	034	006	And Emmor the father of Sychem went forth to Jacob, to speak to him.
001	GEN	034	007	And the sons of Jacob came from the plain; and when they heard, the men were deeply pained, and it was very grievous to them, because [the man] wrought folly in Israel, having lain with the daughter of Jacob, and so it must not be.
001	GEN	034	008	And Emmor spoke to them, saying, Sychem my son has chosen in his heart your daughter; give her therefore to him for a wife,
001	GEN	034	009	and intermarry with us. Give us your daughters, and take our daughters for your sons.
001	GEN	034	010	And dwell in the midst of us; and, behold, the land is spacious before you, dwell in it, and trade, and get possessions in it.
001	GEN	034	011	And Sychem said to her father and to her brothers, I would find grace before you, and we will give whatever ye shall name.
001	GEN	034	012	Multiply [your demand of] dowry very much, and I will give accordingly as ye shall say to me, only ye shall give me this damsel for a wife.
001	GEN	034	013	And the sons of Jacob answered to Sychem and Emmor his father craftily, and spoke to them, because they had defiled Dina their sister.
001	GEN	034	014	And Symeon and Levi, the brothers of Dina, said to them, We shall not be able to do this thing, to give our sister to a man who is uncircumcised, for it is a reproach to us.
001	GEN	034	015	Only on these terms will we conform to you, and dwell among you, if ye also will be as we are, in that every male of you be circumcised.
001	GEN	034	016	And we will give our daughters to you, and we will take of your daughters for wives to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will be as one race.
001	GEN	034	017	But if ye will not hearken to us to be circumcised, we will take our daughter and depart.
001	GEN	034	018	And the words pleased Emmor, and Sychem the son of Emmor.

001	GEN	038	010	And his doing this appeared evil before God; and he slew him also.
001	GEN	038	011	And Judas said to Thamar, his daughter-in-law, Sit thou a widow in the house of thy father-in-law, until Selom my son be grown; for he said, lest he also die as his brethren; and Thamar departed, and sat in the house of her father.
001	GEN	038	012	And the days were fulfilled, and Sava the wife of Judas died; and Judas, being comforted, went to them that sheared his sheep, himself and Iras his Shepherd the Odollamite, to Thamna.

001	GEN	038	014	And having taken off the garments of her widowhood from her, she put on a veil, and ornamented her face, and sat by the gates of Aenan, which is in the way to Thamna, for she saw that Selom was grown; but he gave her not to him for a wife.
001	GEN	038	015	And when Judas saw her, he thought her to be a harlot; for she covered her face, and he knew her not.
001	GEN	038	016	And he went out of his way to her, and said to her, Let me come in to thee; for he knew not that she was his daughter-in-law; and she said, What wilt thou give me if thou shouldest come in to me?
001	GEN	038	017	And he said, I will send thee a kid of the goats from my flock; and she said, [Well], if thou wilt give me an earnest, until thou send it.
001	GEN	038	018	And he said, What is the earnest that I shall give thee? and she said, Thy ring, and thy bracelet, and the staff in thy hand; and he gave them to her, and went in to her, and she conceived by him.

001	GEN	038	022	And he returned to Judas, and said, I have not found her; and the men of the place say, There is no harlot here.
001	GEN	038	023	And Judas said, Let her have them, but let us not be ridiculed; I sent this kid, but thou hast not found her.
001	GEN	038	024	And it came to pass after three months, that it was told Judas, saying, Thamar thy daughter-in-law has grievously played the harlot, and behold she is with child by whoredom; and Judas said, Bring her out, and let her be burnt.
001	GEN	038	025	And as they were bringing her, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, I am with child by the man whose these things are; and she said, See whose is this ring and bracelet and staff.
001	GEN	038	026	And Judas knew [them], and said, Thamar is cleared rather than I, forasmuch as I gave her not to Selom my son: and he knew her not again.

001	GEN	039	012	And she caught hold of him by his clothes, and said, Lie with me; and having left his clothes in her hands, he fled, and went forth.
001	GEN	039	013	And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his clothes in her hands, and fled, and gone forth,
001	GEN	039	014	that she called those that were in the house, and spoke to them, saying, See, he has brought in to us a Hebrew servant to mock us—he came in to me, saying, Lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice.
001	GEN	039	015	And when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, having left his clothes with me, he fled, and went forth out.
001	GEN	039	016	So she leaves the clothes by her, until the master came to his house.
001	GEN	039	017	And she spoke to him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, whom thou broughtest in to us, came in to me to mock me, and said to me, I will lie with thee.
001	GEN	039	018	And when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, having left his clothes with me, he fled and departed forth.
001	GEN	039	019	And it came to pass, when his master heard all the words of his wife, that she spoke to him, saying, Thus did thy servant to me, that he was very angry.
001	GEN	039	020	And his master took Joseph, and cast him into the prison, into the place where the king's prisoners are kept, there in the prison.
001	GEN	039	021	And the Lord was with Joseph, and poured down mercy upon him; and he gave him favour in the sight of the chief keeper of the prison.
001	GEN	039	022	And the chief keeper of the prison gave the prison into the hand of Joseph, and all the prisoners as many as were in the prison; and all things whatsoever they do there, he did them.
001	GEN	039	023	Because of him the chief keeper of the prison knew nothing, for all things were in the hand of Joseph, because the Lord was with him; and whatever things he did, the Lord made them to prosper in his hands.
001	GEN	040	001	And it came to pass after these things, that the chief cupbearer of the king of Egypt and the chief baker trespassed against their lord the king of Egypt.
001	GEN	040	002	And Pharao was wroth with his two eunuchs, with his chief cupbearer, and with his chief baker.
001	GEN	040	003	And he put them in ward, into the prison, into the place whereinto Joseph had been led.
001	GEN	040	004	And the chief keeper of the prison committed them to Joseph, and he stood by them; and they were [some] days in the prison.
001	GEN	040	005	And they both had a dream in one night; and the vision of the dream of the chief cupbearer and chief baker, who belonged to the king of Egypt, who were in the prison, was this.
001	GEN	040	006	Joseph went in to them in the morning, and saw them, and they had been troubled.
001	GEN	040	007	And he asked the eunuchs of Pharao who were with him in the prison with his master, saying, Why is it that your countenances are sad to-day?
001	GEN	040	008	And they said to him, We have seen a dream, and there is no interpreter of it. And Joseph said to them, Is not the interpretation of them through god? tell [them] than to me.
001	GEN	040	009	And the chief cupbearer related his dream to Joseph, and said, In my dream a vine was before me.
001	GEN	040	010	And in the vine [were] three stems; and it budding shot forth blossoms; the clusters of grapes were ripe.
001	GEN	040	011	And the cup of Pharao was in my hand; and I took the bunch of grapes, and squeezed it into the cup, and gave the cup into Pharao's hand.
001	GEN	040	012	And Joseph said to him, This is the interpretation of it. The three stems are three days.
001	GEN	040	013	Yet three days and Pharao shall remember thy office, and he shall restore thee to thy place of chief cupbearer, and thou shalt give the cup of Pharao into his hand, according to thy former high place, as thou wast wont to be cupbearer.
001	GEN	040	014	But remember me of thyself, when it shall be well with thee, and thou shalt deal mercifully with me, and thou shalt make mention of me to Pharao, and thou shalt bring me forth out of this dungeon.
001	GEN	040	015	For surely I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews, and here I have done nothing, but they have cast me into this pit.
001	GEN	040	016	And the chief baker saw that he interpreted aright; and he said to Joseph, I also saw a dream, and methought I took up on my head three baskets of mealy food.
001	GEN	040	017	And in the upper basket there was the work of the baker of every kind which Pharao eats; and the fowls of the air ate them out of the basket that was on my head.
001	GEN	040	018	And Joseph answered and said to him, This is the interpretation of it; The three baskets are three days.
001	GEN	040	019	Yet three days, and Pharao shall take away thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree, and the birds of the sky shall eat thy flesh from off thee.
001	GEN	040	020	And it came to pass on the third day that it was Pharao's birth-day, and he made a banquet for all his servants, and he remembered the office of the cupbearer and the office of the baker in the midst of his servants.
001	GEN	040	021	And he restored the chief cupbearer to his office, and he gave the cup into Pharao's hand.
001	GEN	040	022	And he hanged the chief baker, as Joseph, interpreted to them.
001	GEN	040	023	Yet did not the chief cupbearer remember Joseph, but forgot him.
001	GEN	041	001	And it came to pass after two full years that Pharao had a dream. He thought he stood upon [the bank of] the river.
001	GEN	041	002	And lo, there came up as it were out of the river seven cows, fair in appearance, and choice of flesh, and they fed on the sedge.
001	GEN	041	003	And other seven cows came up after these out of the river, ill-favoured and lean-fleshed, and fed by the [other] cows on the bank of the river.
001	GEN	041	004	And the seven ill-favoured and lean cows devoured the seven well-favoured and choice-fleshed cows; and Pharao awoke.
001	GEN	041	005	And he dreamed again. And, behold, seven ears came up on one stalk, choice and good.
001	GEN	041	006	And, behold, seven ears thin and blasted with the wind, grew up after them.
001	GEN	041	007	And the seven thin ears and blasted with the wind devoured the seven choice and full ears; and Pharao awoke, and it was a dream.
001	GEN	041	008	And it was morning, and his soul was troubled; and he sent and called all the interpreters of Egypt, and all her wise men; and Pharao related to them his dream, and there was no one to interpret it to Pharao.
001	GEN	041	009	And the chief cupbearer spoke to Pharao, saying, I this day remember my fault:
001	GEN	041	010	Pharao was angry with his servants, and put us in prison in the house of the captain of the guard, both me and the chief baker.
001	GEN	041	011	And we had a dream both in one night, I and he; we saw, each according to his dream.
001	GEN	041	012	And there was there with us a young man, a Hebrew servant of the captain of the guard; and we related to him [our dreams], and he interpreted [them] to us.
001	GEN	041	013	And it came to pass, as he interpreted them to us, so also it happened, both that I was restored to my office, and that he was hanged.
001	GEN	041	014	And Pharao having sent, called Joseph; and they brought him out from the prison, and shaved him, and changed his dress, and he came to Pharao.
001	GEN	041	015	And Pharao said to Joseph, I have seen a vision, and there is no one to interpret it; but I have heard say concerning thee that thou didst hear dreams and interpret them.
001	GEN	041	016	And Joseph answered Pharao and said, Without God an answer of safety shall not be given to Pharao.
001	GEN	041	017	And Pharao spoke to Joseph, saying, In my dream methought I stood by the bank of the river;
001	GEN	041	018	and there came up as it were out of the river, seven cows well-favoured and choice-fleshed, and they fed on the sedge.
001	GEN	041	019	And behold seven other cows came up after them out of the river, evil and ill-favoured and lean-fleshed, such that I never saw worse in all the land of Egypt.
001	GEN	041	020	And the seven ill-favoured and thin cows ate up the seven first good and choice cows.
001	GEN	041	021	And they went into their bellies; and it was not perceptible that they had gone into their bellies, and their appearance was ill-favoured, as also at the beginning; and after I awoke I slept,
001	GEN	041	022	and saw again in my sleep, and as it were seven ears came up on one stem, full and good.
001	GEN	041	023	And other seven ears, thin and blasted with the wind, sprang up close to them.
001	GEN	041	024	And the seven thin and blasted ears devoured the seven fine and full ears: so I spoke to the interpreters, and there was no one to explain it to me.
001	GEN	041	025	And Joseph said to Pharao, The dream of Pharao is one; whatever God does, he has shewn to Pharao.
001	GEN	041	026	The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good ears are seven years; the dream of Pharao is one.
001	GEN	041	027	And the seven thin kine that came up after them are seven years; and the seven thin and blasted ears are seven years; there shall be seven years of famine.
001	GEN	041	028	And as for the word which I have told Pharao, whatsoever God intends to do, he has shewn to Pharao:
001	GEN	041	029	behold, for seven years there is coming great plenty in all the land of Egypt.
001	GEN	041	030	But there shall come seven years of famine after these, and they shall forget the plenty that shall be in all Egypt, and the famine shall consume the land.
001	GEN	041	031	And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of the famine that shall be after this, for it shall be very grievous.
001	GEN	041	032	And concerning the repetition of the dream to Pharao twice, [it is] because the saying which is from God shall be true, and God will hasten to accomplish it.
001	GEN	041	033	Now then, look out a wise and prudent man, and set him over the land of Egypt.
001	GEN	041	034	And let Pharao make and appoint local governors over the land; and let them take up a fifth part of all the produce of the land of Egypt for the seven years of the plenty.
001	GEN	041	035	And let them gather all the food of these seven good years that are coming, and let the corn be gathered under the hand of Pharao; let food be kept in the cities.
001	GEN	041	036	And the stored food shall be for the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; and the land shall not be utterly destroyed by the famine.
001	GEN	041	037	And the word was pleasing in the sight of Pharao, and in the sight of all his servants.
001	GEN	041	038	And Pharao said to all his servants, Shall we find such a man as this, who has the Spirit of God in him?
001	GEN	041	039	And Pharao said to Joseph, Since God has shewed thee all these things, there is not a wiser or more prudent man than thou.
001	GEN	041	040	Thou shalt be over my house, and all my people shall be obedient to thy word; only in the throne will I excel thee.
001	GEN	041	041	And Pharao said to Joseph, Behold, I set thee this day over all the land of Egypt.
001	GEN	041	042	And Pharao took his ring off his hand, and put it on the hand of Joseph, and put on him a robe of fine linen, and put a necklace of gold about his neck.
001	GEN	041	043	And he mounted him on the second of his chariots, and a herald made proclamation before him; and he set him over all the land of Egypt.
001	GEN	041	044	And Pharao said to Joseph, I am Pharao; without thee no one shall lift up his hand on all the land of Egypt.
001	GEN	041	045	And Pharao called the name of Joseph, Psonthomphanech; and he gave him Aseneth, the daughter of Petephres, priest of Heliopolis, to wife.
001	GEN	041	046	And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharao, king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharao, and went through all the land of Egypt.
001	GEN	041	047	And the land produced, in the seven years of plenty, [whole] handfuls [of corn].
001	GEN	041	048	And he gathered all the food of the seven years, in which was the plenty in the land of Egypt; and he laid up the food in the cities; the food of the fields of a city round about it he laid up in it.
001	GEN	041	049	And Joseph gathered very much corn as the sand of the sea, until it could not be numbered, for there was no number [of it].
001	GEN	041	050	And to Joseph were born two sons, before the seven years of famine came, which Aseneth, the daughter of Petephres, priest of Heliopolis, bore to him.
001	GEN	041	051	And Joseph called the name of the first-born, Manasse; for God, [said he], has made me forget all my toils, and all my father's house.
001	GEN	041	052	And he called the name of the second, Ephraim; for God, [said he], has increased me in the land of my humiliation.
001	GEN	041	053	And the seven years of plenty passed away, which were in the land of Egypt.
001	GEN	041	054	And the seven years of famine began to come, as Joseph said; and there was a famine in all the land; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.
001	GEN	041	055	And all the land of Egypt was hungry; and the people cried to Pharao for bread. And Pharao said to all the Egyptians, Go to Joseph, and do whatsoever he shall tell you.
001	GEN	041	056	And the famine was on the face of all the earth; and Joseph opened all the granaries, and sold to all the Egyptians.
001	GEN	041	057	And all countries came to Egypt to buy of Joseph, for the famine prevailed in all the earth.
001	GEN	042	001	And Jacob having seen that there was a sale [of corn] in Egypt, said to his sons, Why are ye indolent?
001	GEN	042	002	Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt; go down thither, and buy for us a little food, that we may live, and not die.
001	GEN	042	003	And the ten brethren of Joseph went down to buy corn out of Egypt.
001	GEN	042	004	But [Jacob] sent not Benjamin, the brother of Joseph, with his brethren; for he said, Lest, haply, disease befall him.
001	GEN	042	005	And the sons of Israel came to buy with those that came, for the famine was in the land of Chanaan.
001	GEN	042	006	And Joseph was ruler of the land; he sold to all the people of the land. And the brethren of Joseph, having come, did reverence to him, [bowing] with the face to the ground.
001	GEN	042	007	And when Joseph saw his brethren, he knew them, and estranged himself from them, and spoke hard words to them; and said to them, Whence are ye come? And they said, Out of the land of Chanaan, to buy food.
001	GEN	042	008	And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.
001	GEN	042	009	And Joseph remembered his dream, which he saw; and he said to them, Ye are spies; to observe the marks of the land are ye come.
001	GEN	042	010	But they said, Nay, Sir, we thy servants are come to buy food;
001	GEN	042	011	we are all sons of one man; we are peaceable, thy servants are not spies.
001	GEN	042	012	And he said to them, Nay, but ye are come to observe the marks of the land.
001	GEN	042	013	And they said, We thy servants are twelve brethren, in the land of Chanaan; and, behold, the youngest is with our father to-day, but the other one is not.
001	GEN	042	014	And Joseph said to them, This is it that I spoke to you, saying, ye are spies;
001	GEN	042	015	herein shall ye be manifested; by the health of Pharao, ye shall not depart hence, unless your younger brother come hither.
001	GEN	042	016	Send one of you, and take your brother; and go ye to prison, till your words be clear, whether ye speak the truth or not; but, if not, by the health of Pharao, verily ye are spies.
001	GEN	042	017	And he put them in prison three days.
001	GEN	042	018	And he said to them on the third day, This do, and ye shall live, for I fear God.
001	GEN	042	019	If ye be peaceable, let one of your brethren be detained in prison; but go ye, and carry back the corn ye have purchased.
001	GEN	042	020	And bring your younger brother to me, and your words shall be believed; but, if not, ye shall die. And they did so.
001	GEN	042	021	And each said to his brother, Yes, indeed, for we are in fault concerning our brother, when we disregarded the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we hearkened not to him; and therefore has this affliction come upon us.
001	GEN	042	022	And Ruben answered them, saying, Did I not speak to you, saying, Hurt not the boy, and ye heard me not? and, behold, his blood is required.
001	GEN	042	023	But they knew not that Joseph understood them; for there was an interpreter between them.
001	GEN	042	024	And Joseph turned away from them, and wept; and again he came to them, and spoke to them; and he took Symeon from them, and bound him before their eyes.
001	GEN	042	025	And Joseph gave orders to fill their vessels with corn, and to return their money to each into his sack, and to give them provision for the way; and it was so done to them.
001	GEN	042	026	And having put the corn on the asses, they departed thence.
001	GEN	042	027	And one having opened his sack to give his asses fodder, at the place where they rested, saw also his bundle of money, for it was on the mouth of his sack.
001	GEN	042	028	And he said to his brethren, My money has been restored to me, and behold this is in my sack. And their heart was wonder-struck, and they were troubled, saying one to another, What is this that God has done to us?
001	GEN	042	029	And they came to their father, Jacob, into the land of Chanaan, and reported to him all that had happened to them, saying,
001	GEN	042	030	The man, the lord of the land, spoke harsh words to us, and put us in prison as spies of the land.
001	GEN	042	031	And we said to him, We are men of peace, we are not spies.
001	GEN	042	032	We are twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is with his father to-day in the land of Chanaan.
001	GEN	042	033	And the man, the lord of the land, said to us, Herein shall I know that ye are peaceable; leave one brother here with me, and having taken the corn ye have purchased for your family, depart.
001	GEN	042	034	And bring to me your younger brother; then I shall know that ye are not spies, but that ye are men of peace: and I will restore you your brother, and ye shall trade in the land.
001	GEN	042	035	And it came to pass as they were emptying their sacks, there was each man's bundle of money in his sack; and they and their father saw their bundles of money, and they were afraid.
001	GEN	042	036	And their father Jacob said to them, Ye have bereaved me. Joseph is not, Symeon is not, and will ye take Benjamin? all these things have come upon me.
001	GEN	042	037	And Ruben spoke to his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee; give him into my hand, and I will bring him back to thee.
001	GEN	042	038	But he said, My son shall not go down with you, because his brother is dead, and he only has been left; and [suppose] it shall come to pass that he is afflicted by the way by which ye go, then ye shall bring down my old age with sorrow to Hades.
001	GEN	043	001	But the famine prevailed in the land.
001	GEN	043	002	And it came to pass, when they had finished eating the corn which they had brought out of Egypt, that their father said to them, Go again; buy us a little food.
001	GEN	043	003	And Judas spoke to him, saying, The man, the lord of the country, positively testified to us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, unless your younger brother be with you.
001	GEN	043	004	If, then, thou send our brother with us, we will go down, and buy thee food;
001	GEN	043	005	but if thou send not our brother with us, we will not go: for the man spoke to us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, unless your younger brother be with you.
001	GEN	043	006	And Israel said, Why did ye harm me, inasmuch as ye told the man that ye had a brother?
001	GEN	043	007	And they said, The man closely questioned us about our family also, saying, Does your father yet live, and have ye a brother? and we answered him according to this question: did we know that he would say to us, Bring your brother?
001	GEN	043	008	And Judas said to his father Israel, Send the boy with me, and we will arise and go, that we may live and not die, both we and thou, and our store.
001	GEN	043	009	And I engage for him; at my hand do thou require him; if I bring him not to thee, and place him before thee, I shall be guilty toward thee for ever.
001	GEN	043	010	For if we had not tarried, we should now have returned twice.
001	GEN	043	011	And Israel, their father, said to them, If it be so, do this; take of the fruits of the earth in your vessels, and carry down to the man presents of gum and honey, and frankincense, and stacte, and turpentine, and walnuts.
001	GEN	043	012	And take double money in your hands, and the money that was returned in your sacks, carry back with you, lest peradventure it is a mistake.
001	GEN	043	013	And take your brother; and arise, go down to the man.
001	GEN	043	014	And my God give you favour in the sight of the man, and send away your other brother, and Benjamin, for I accordingly as I have been bereaved, am bereaved.
001	GEN	043	015	And the men having taken these presents, and the double money, took in their hands also Benjamin; and they rose up and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.
001	GEN	043	016	And Joseph saw them and his brother Benjamin, born of the same mother; and he said to the steward of his household, Bring the men into the house, and slay beasts and make ready, for the men are to eat bread with me at noon.
001	GEN	043	017	And the man did as Joseph said; and he brought the men into the house of Joseph.
001	GEN	043	018	And the men, when they perceived that they were brought into the house of Joseph, said, We are brought in because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first; even in order to inform against us, and lay it to our charge; to take us for servants, and our asses.
001	GEN	043	019	And having approached the man who was over the house of Joseph, they spoke to him in the porch of the house,
001	GEN	043	020	saying, We pray [thee], Sir; we came down at first to buy food.
001	GEN	043	021	And it came to pass, when we came to unlade, and opened our sacks, [there was] also this money of each in his sack; we have now brought back our money by weight in our hands.
001	GEN	043	022	And we have brought other money with us to buy food; we know not who put the money into our sacks.
001	GEN	043	023	And he said to them, [God deal] mercifully with you; be not afraid; your God, and the God of your fathers, has given you treasures in your sacks, and I have enough of your good money. And he brought Symeon out to them.
001	GEN	043	024	And he brought water to wash their feet; and gave provender to their asses.
001	GEN	043	025	And they prepared their gifts, until Joseph came at noon, for they heard that he was going to dine there.
001	GEN	043	026	And Joseph entered into the house, and they brought him the gifts which they had in their hands, into the house; and they did him reverence with their face to the ground.
001	GEN	043	027	And he asked them, How are ye? and he said to them, Is your father, the old man of whom ye spoke, well? Does he yet live?
001	GEN	043	028	And they said, Thy servant our father is well; he is yet alive. And he said, Blessed be that man by God; —and they bowed, and did him reverence.
001	GEN	043	029	And Joseph lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, born of the same mother; and he said, Is this your younger brother, whom ye spoke of bringing to me? and he said, God have mercy on thee, my son.
001	GEN	043	030	And Joseph was troubled, for his bowels yearned over his brother, and he sought to weep; and he went into his chamber, and wept there.
001	GEN	043	031	And he washed his face and came out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread.
001	GEN	043	032	And they set on [bread] for him alone, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians feasting with him by themselves, for the Egyptians could not eat bread with the Hebrews, for it is an abomination to the Egyptians.
001	GEN	043	033	And they sat before him, the first-born according to his seniority, and the younger according to his youth; and the men looked with amazement every one at his brother.
001	GEN	043	034	And they took their portions from him to themselves; but Benjamin's portion was five times as much as the portions of [the others]. And they drank and were filled with drink with him.
001	GEN	044	001	And Joseph charged the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put the money of each in the mouth of his sack.
001	GEN	044	002	And put my silver cup into the sack of the youngest, and the price of his corn. And it was done according to the word of Joseph, as he said.
001	GEN	044	003	The morning dawned, and the men were sent away, they and their asses.
001	GEN	044	004	And when they had gone out of the city, [and] were not far off, then Joseph said to his steward, Arise, and pursue after the men; and thou shalt overtake them, and say to them, Why have ye returned evil for good?
001	GEN	044	005	Why have ye stolen my silver cup? is it not this out of which my lord drinks? and he divines augury with it; ye have accomplished evil in that which ye have done.
001	GEN	044	006	And he found them, and spoke to them according to these words.
001	GEN	044	007	And they said to him, Why does our lord speak according to these words? far be it from thy servants to do according to this word.
001	GEN	044	008	If we brought back to thee out of the land of Chanaan the money which we found in our sacks, how should we steal silver or gold out of the house of thy lord?
001	GEN	044	009	With whomsoever of thy servants thou shalt find the cup, let him die; and, moreover, we will be servants to our lord.
001	GEN	044	010	And he said, Now then it shall be as ye say; with whomsoever the cup shall be found, he shall be my servant, and ye shall be clear.
001	GEN	044	011	And they hasted, and took down every man his sack on the ground, and they opened every man his sack.
001	GEN	044	012	And he searched, beginning from the eldest, until he came to the youngest; and he found the cup in Benjamin's sack.
001	GEN	044	013	And they rent their garments, and laid each man his sack on his ass, and returned to the city.
001	GEN	044	014	And Judas and his brethren came in to Joseph, while he was yet there, and fell on the ground before him.
001	GEN	044	015	And Joseph said to them, What is this thing that ye have done? know ye not that a man such as I can surely divine?
001	GEN	044	016	And Judas said, What shall we answer to our lord, or what shall we say, or wherein should we be justified? whereas God has discovered the unrighteousness of thy servants; behold, we are slaves to our lord, both we and he with whom the cup has been found.
001	GEN	044	017	And Joseph said, Far be it from me to do this thing; the man with whom the cup has been found, he shall be my servant; but do ye go up with safety to your father.
001	GEN	044	018	And Judas drew near him, and said, I pray, Sir, let thy servant speak a word before thee, and be not angry with thy servant, for thou art next to Pharao.
001	GEN	044	019	Sir, thou askedst thy servants, saying, Have ye a father or a brother?
001	GEN	044	020	And we said to [my] lord, We have a father, an old man, and he has a son of his old age, a young one, and his brother is dead, and he alone has been left behind to his mother, and his father loves him.
001	GEN	044	021	And thou saidst to they servants, Bring him down to me, and I will take care of him.
001	GEN	044	022	And we said to [my] lord, The child will not be able to leave his father; but if he should leave his father, he will die.
001	GEN	044	023	But thou saidst to they servants, Except your younger brother come down with you, ye shall not see my face again.
001	GEN	044	024	And it came to pass, when we went up to thy servant our father, we reported to him the words of our lord.
001	GEN	044	025	And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food.
001	GEN	044	026	And we said, We shall not be able to go down; but if our younger brother go down with us, we will go down; for we shall not be able to see the man's face, our younger brother not being with us.
001	GEN	044	027	And thy servant our father said to us, Ye know that my wife bore me two [sons];
001	GEN	044	028	and one is departed from me; and ye said that he was devoured of wild beasts, and I have not seen him until now.
001	GEN	044	029	If then ye take this one also from my presence, and an affliction happen to him by the way, then shall ye bring down my old age with sorrow to the grave.
001	GEN	044	030	Now then, if I should go in to they servant, and our father, and the boy should not be with us, (and his life depends on this [lad's] life)
001	GEN	044	031	—it shall even come to pass, when he sees the boy is not with us, [that] he will die, and thy servants will bring down the old age of thy servant, and our father, with sorrow to the grave.
001	GEN	044	032	For thy servant has received the boy [in charge] from his father, saying, If I bring him not to thee, and place him before thee, I shall be guilty towards my father for ever.
001	GEN	044	033	Now then I will remain a servant with thee instead of the lad, a domestic of my lord; but let the lad go up with his brethren.
001	GEN	044	034	For how shall I go up to my father, the lad not being with us? lest I behold the evils which will befall my father.
001	GEN	045	001	And Joseph could not refrain himself when all were standing by him, but said, Dismiss all from me; and no one stood near Joseph, when he made himself known to his brethren.
001	GEN	045	002	And he uttered his voice with weeping; and all the Egyptians heard, and it was reported to the house of Pharao.
001	GEN	045	003	And Joseph said to his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him, for they were troubled.
001	GEN	045	004	And Joseph said to his brethren, Draw nigh to me; and they drew nigh; and he said, I am your brother Joseph, whom ye sold into Egypt.
001	GEN	045	005	Now then be not grieved, and let it not seem hard to you that ye sold me hither, for God sent me before you for life.
001	GEN	045	006	For this second year there is famine on the earth, and there are yet five years remaining, in which there is to be neither ploughing, nor mowing.
001	GEN	045	007	For God sent me before you, that there might be left to you a remnant upon the earth, even to nourish a great remnant of you.
001	GEN	045	008	Now then ye did not send me hither, but God; and he hath made me as a father of Pharao, and lord of all his house, and ruler of all the land of Egypt.
001	GEN	045	009	Hasten, therefore, and go up to my father, and say to him, These things saith thy son Joseph; God has made me lord of all the land of Egypt; come down therefore to me, and tarry not.
001	GEN	045	010	And thou shalt dwell in the land of Gesem of Arabia; and thou shalt be near me, thou and thy sons, and thy sons' sons, thy sheep and thine oxen, and whatsoever things are thine.
001	GEN	045	011	And I will nourish thee there: for the famine is yet for five years; lest thou be consumed, and thy sons, and all thy possessions.
001	GEN	045	012	Behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaks to you.
001	GEN	045	013	Report, therefore, to my father all my glory in Egypt, and all things that ye have seen, and make haste and bring down my father hither.
001	GEN	045	014	And he fell on his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept on him; and Benjamin wept on his neck.
001	GEN	045	015	And he kissed all his brethren, and wept on them; and after these things his brethren spoke to him.
001	GEN	045	016	And the report was carried into the house of Pharao, saying, Joseph's brethren are come; and Pharao was glad, and his household.
001	GEN	045	017	And Pharao said to Joseph, Say to thy brethren, Do this; fill your waggons, and depart into the land of Chanaan.
001	GEN	045	018	And take up your father, and your possessions, and come to me; and I will give you of all the goods of Egypt, and ye shall eat the marrow of the land.
001	GEN	045	019	And do thou charge them thus; that they should take for them waggons out of the land of Egypt, for your little ones, and for your wives; and take up your father, and come.
001	GEN	045	020	And be not sparing in regard to your property, for all the good of Egypt shall be yours.
001	GEN	045	021	And the children of Israel did so; and Joseph gave to them waggons, according to the words spoken by king Pharao; and he gave them provision for the journey.
001	GEN	045	022	And he gave to them all two sets of raiment apiece; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of gold, and five changes of raiment.
001	GEN	045	023	And to his father he sent [presents] at the same rate, and ten asses, bearing some of all the good things of Egypt, and ten mules, bearing bread for his father for thy journey.
001	GEN	045	024	And he sent away his brethren, and they went; and he said to them, Be not angry by the way.
001	GEN	045	025	And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Chanaan, to Jacob their father.
001	GEN	045	026	And they reported to him, saying, Thy son Joseph is living, and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt; and Jacob was amazed, for he did not believe them.
001	GEN	045	027	But they spoke to him all the words uttered by Joseph, whatsoever he said to them; and having seen the chariots which Joseph sent to take him up, the spirit of Jacob their father revived.
001	GEN	045	028	And Israel said, It is a great thing for me if Joseph my son is yet alive. I will go and see him before I die.
001	GEN	046	001	And Israel departed, he and all that he had, and came to the well of the oath; and he offered sacrifice to the God of his father Isaac.
001	GEN	046	002	And God spoke to Israel in a night vision, saying, Jacob, Jacob; and he said, What is it?
001	GEN	046	003	And he says to him, I am the God of thy fathers; fear not to go down into Egypt, for I will make thee there a great nation.
001	GEN	046	004	And I will go down with thee into Egypt, and I will bring thee up at the end; and Joseph shall put his hands on thine eyes.
001	GEN	046	005	And Jacob rose up from the well of the oath; and the sons of Israel took up their father, and the baggage, and their wives on the waggons, which Joseph sent to take them.
001	GEN	046	006	And they took up their goods, and all their property, which they had gotten in the land of Chanaan; they came into the land of Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him.
001	GEN	046	007	The sons, and the sons of his sons with him; [his] daughters, and the daughters of his daughters; and he brought all his seed into Egypt.
001	GEN	046	008	And these are the names of the sons of Israel that went into Egypt with their father Jacob—Jacob and his sons. The first-born of Jacob, Ruben.
001	GEN	046	009	And the sons of Ruben; Enoch, and Phallus, Asron, and Charmi.
001	GEN	046	010	and the sons of Symeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Aod, and Achin, and Saar, and Saul, the son of a Chananitish woman.
001	GEN	046	011	And the sons of Levi; Gerson, Cath, and Merari.
001	GEN	046	012	And the sons of Judas; Er, and Aunan, and Selom, and Phares, and Zara: and Er and Aunan died in the land of Chanaan.
001	GEN	046	013	And the sons of Phares [were] Esron, and Jemuel. And the sons of Issachar; Thola, and Phua, and Asum, and Sambran.
001	GEN	046	014	And the sons of Zabulun, Sered, and Allon, and Achoel.
001	GEN	046	015	These [are] the sons of Lea, which she bore to Jacob in Mesopotamia of Syria, and Dina his daughter; all the souls, sons and daughters, thirty-three.
001	GEN	046	016	And the sons of Gad; Saphon, and Angis, and Sannis, and Thasoban, and Aedis, and Aroedis, and Areelis.
001	GEN	046	017	And the sons of Aser; Jemna, Jessua, and Jeul, and Baria, and Sara their sister. And the sons of Baria; Chobor, and Melchiil.
001	GEN	046	018	These [are] the sons of Zelpha, which Laban gave to his daughter Lea, who bore these to Jacob, sixteen souls.
001	GEN	046	019	And the sons of Rachel, the wife of Jacob; Joseph, and Benjamin.
001	GEN	046	020	And there were sons born to Joseph in the land of Egypt, whom Aseneth, the daughter of Petephres, priest of Heliopolis, bore to him, [even] Manasses and Ephraim. And there were sons born to Manasses, which the Syrian concubine bore to him, [even] Machir. And Machir begot Galaad. And the sons of Ephraim, the brother of Manasses; Sutalaam, and Taam. And the sons of Sutalaam; Edom.
001	GEN	046	021	and the sons of Benjamin; Bala, and Bochor, and Asbel. And the sons of Bala were Gera, and Noeman, and Anchis, and Ros, and Mamphim. And Gera begot Arad.
001	GEN	046	022	These [are] the sons of Rachel, which she bore to Jacob; all the souls eighteen.
001	GEN	046	023	And the sons of Dan; Asom.
001	GEN	046	024	And the sons of Nephthalim; Asiel, and Goni, and Issaar, and Sollem.
001	GEN	046	025	These [are] the sons of Balla, whom Laban gave to his daughter Rachel, who bore these to Jacob; all the souls, seven.
001	GEN	046	026	And all the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, who came out of his loins, besides the wives of the sons of Jacob, [even] all the souls were sixty-six.
001	GEN	046	027	And the sons of Joseph, who were born to him in the land of Egypt, were nine souls; all the souls of the house of Jacob who came with Joseph into Egypt, were seventy-five souls.
001	GEN	046	028	And he sent Judas before him to Joseph, to meet him to the city of Heroes, into the land of Ramesses.
001	GEN	046	029	And Joseph having made ready his chariots, went up to meet Israel his father, at the city of Heroes; and having appeared to him, fell on his neck, and wept with abundant weeping.
001	GEN	046	030	And Israel said to Joseph, After this I will [gladly] die, since I have seen thy face, for thou art yet living.
001	GEN	046	031	And Joseph said to his brethren, I will go up and tell Pharao, and will say to him, My brethren, and my father's house, who were in the land of Chanaan, are come to me.
001	GEN	046	032	And the men are shepherds; for they have been feeders of cattle, and they have brought with them their cattle, and their kine, and all their property.
001	GEN	046	033	If then Pharao call you, and say to you, What is you occupation?
001	GEN	046	034	Ye shall say, We thy servants are herdsmen from our youth until now, both we and our fathers: that ye may dwell in the land of Gesem of Arabia, for every shepherd is an abomination to the Egyptians.
001	GEN	047	001	And Joseph came and told Pharao, [saying], My father, and my brethren, and their cattle, and their oxen, and all their possessions, are come out of the land of Chanaan, and behold, they are in the land of Gesem.
001	GEN	047	002	And he took of his brethren five men, and set them before Pharao.
001	GEN	047	003	And Pharao said to the brethren of Joseph, What is your occupation? and they said to Pharao, Thy servants are shepherds, both we and our father.
001	GEN	047	004	And they said to Pharao, We are come to sojourn in the land, for there is no pasture for the flocks of thy servants, for the famine has prevailed in the land of Chanaan; now then, we will dwell in the land of Gesem. And Pharao said to Joseph, Let them dwell in the land of Gesem; and if thou knowest that there are among them able men, make them overseers of my cattle. So Jacob and his sons came into Egypt, to Joseph; and Pharao, king of Egypt, heard [of it].
001	GEN	047	005	And Pharao spoke to Joseph, saying, Thy father, and thy brethren, are come to thee.
001	GEN	047	006	Behold, the land of Egypt is before thee; settle thy father and thy brethren in the best land.
001	GEN	047	007	And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharao; and Jacob blessed Pharao.
001	GEN	047	008	And Pharao said to Jacob, How many are the years of the days of thy life?
001	GEN	047	009	And Jacob said to Pharao, The days of the years of my life, wherein I sojourn, are a hundred and thirty years; few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, they have not attained to the days of the life of my fathers, in which days they sojourned.
001	GEN	047	010	And Jacob blessed Pharao, and departed from him.
001	GEN	047	011	And Joseph settled his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best land, in the land of Ramesses, as Pharao commanded.
001	GEN	047	012	And Joseph gave provision to his father, and his brethren, and to all the house of his father, corn for each person.
001	GEN	047	013	And there was no corn in all the land, for the famine prevailed greatly; and the land of Egypt, and the land of Chanaan, fainted for the famine.
001	GEN	047	014	And Joseph gathered all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and the land of Chanaan, [in return for] the corn which they bought, and he distributed corn to them; and Joseph brought all the money into the house of Pharao.
001	GEN	047	015	And all the money failed out of the land of Egypt, and out of the land of Chanaan; and all the Egyptians came to Joseph, saying, Give us bread, and why do we die in thy presence? for our money is spent.
001	GEN	047	016	And Joseph said to them, Bring your cattle, and I will give you bread for your cattle, if your money is spent.
001	GEN	047	017	And they brought their cattle to Joseph; and Joseph gave them bread in return for their horses, and for their sheep, and for their oxen, and for their asses; and Joseph maintained them with bread for all their cattle in that year.
001	GEN	047	018	And that year passed, and they came to him in the second year, and said to him, Must we then be consumed from before our lord? for if our money has failed, and our possessions, and our cattle, [brought] to thee our lord, and there has not been left to us before our lord more than our own bodies and our land, [we are indeed destitute].
001	GEN	047	019	In order, then, that we die not before thee, and the land be made desolate, buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants to Pharao: give seed that we may sow, and live and not die, so our land shall not be made desolate.
001	GEN	047	020	And Joseph bought all the land of the Egyptians, for Pharao; for the Egyptians sold their land to Pharao; for the famine prevailed against them, and the land became Pharao's.
001	GEN	047	021	And he brought the people into bondage to him, for servants, from one extremity of Egypt to the other,
001	GEN	047	022	except only the land of the priests; Joseph bought not this, for Pharao gave a portion in the way of gift to the priests; and they ate their portion which Pharao gave them; therefore they sold not their land.
001	GEN	047	023	And Joseph said to all the Egyptians, Behold, I have bought you and your land this day for Pharao; take seed for you, and sow the land.
001	GEN	047	024	And there shall be the fruits of it; and ye shall give the fifth part to Pharao, and the four [remaining] parts shall be for yourselves, for seed for the earth, and for food for you, and all that are in your houses.
001	GEN	047	025	And they said, Thou hast saved us; we have found favour before our lord, and we will be servants to Pharao.
001	GEN	047	026	And Joseph appointed it to them for an ordinance until this day; to reserve a fifth part for Pharao, on the land of Egypt, except only the land of the priests, that was not Pharao's.
001	GEN	047	027	And Israel dwelt in Egypt, in the land of Gesem, and they gained an inheritance upon it; and they increased and multiplied very greatly.
001	GEN	047	028	And Jacob survived seventeen years in the land of Egypt; and Jacob's days of the years of his life were a hundred and forty-seven years.
001	GEN	047	029	and the days of Israel drew nigh for him to die: and he called his son Joseph, and said to him, If I have found favour before thee, put thy hand under my thigh, and thou shalt execute mercy and truth toward me, so as not to bury me in Egypt.
001	GEN	047	030	But I will sleep with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me up out of Egypt, and bury me in their sepulchre. And he said, I will do according to thy word.
001	GEN	047	031	And he said, Swear to me; and he swore to him. And Israel did reverence, leaning on the top of his staff.
001	GEN	048	001	And it came to pass after these things, that it was reported to Joseph, Behold, thy father is ill; and, having taken his two sons, Manasse and Ephraim, he came to Jacob.
001	GEN	048	002	And it was reported to Jacob, saying, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh to thee; and Israel having strengthened himself, sat upon the bed.
001	GEN	048	003	And Jacob said to Joseph, My God appeared to me in Luza, in the land of Chanaan, and blessed me,
001	GEN	048	004	and said to me, Behold, I will increase thee, and multiply thee, and will make of thee multitudes of nations; and I will give this land to thee, and to thy seed after thee, for an everlasting possession.
001	GEN	048	005	Now then thy two sons, who were born to thee in the land of Egypt, before I came to thee into Egypt, are mine; Ephraim and Manasse, as Ruben and Symeon they shall be mine.
001	GEN	048	006	And the children which thou shalt beget hereafter, shall be in the name of their brethren; they shall be named after their inheritances.
001	GEN	048	007	And as for me, when I came out of Mesopotamia of Syria, Rachel, thy mother, died in the land of Chanaan, as I drew night to the horse-course of Chabratha of the land [of Chanaan], so as to come to Ephratha; and I buried her in the road of the course; this is Bethlehem.
001	GEN	048	008	And when Israel saw the sons of Joseph, he said, Who are these to thee?
001	GEN	048	009	And Joseph said to his father, They are my sons, whom God gave me here; and Jacob said, Bring me them, that I may bless them.
001	GEN	048	010	Now the eyes of Israel were dim through age, and he could not see; and he brought them near to him, and he kissed them, and embraced them.
001	GEN	048	011	And Israel said to Joseph, Behold, I have not been deprived of [seeing] thy face, and lo! God has showed me thy seed also.
001	GEN	048	012	And Joseph brought them out from [between] his knees, and they did reverence to him, with their face to the ground.
001	GEN	048	013	And Joseph took his two sons, both Ephraim in his right hand, but on the left of Israel, and Manasse on his left hand, but on the right of Israel, and brought them near to him.
001	GEN	048	014	But Israel having stretched out his right hand, laid it on the head of Ephraim, and he was the younger; and his left hand on the head of Manasse, [guiding] his hands crosswise.
001	GEN	048	015	And he blessed them and said, The God in whose sight my fathers were well pleasing, [even] Abraam and Isaac, the God who continues to feed me from my youth until this day;
001	GEN	048	016	the angel who delivers me from all evils, bless these boys, and my name shall be called upon them, and the name of my fathers, Abraam and Isaac; and let them be increased to a great multitude on the earth.
001	GEN	048	017	And Joseph having seen that his father put his right hand on the head of Ephraim—it seemed grievous to him; and Joseph took hold of the hand of his father, to remove it from the head of Ephraim to the head of Manasse.
001	GEN	048	018	And Joseph said to his father, Not so, father; for this is the first-born; lay thy right-hand upon his head.
001	GEN	048	019	And he would not, but said, I know it, son, I know it; he also shall be a people, and he shall be exalted, but his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.
001	GEN	048	020	And he blessed them in that day, saying, In you shall Israel be blessed, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and Manasse; and he set Ephraim before Manasse.
001	GEN	048	021	And Israel said to Joseph, Behold, I die; and God shall be with you, and restore you to the land of your fathers.
001	GEN	048	022	And I give to thee Sicima, a select portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorites with my sword and bow.
001	GEN	049	001	And Jacob called his sons, and said to them,
001	GEN	049	002	Assemble yourselves, that I may tell you what shall happen to you in the last days. Gather yourselves together, and hear me, sons of Jacob; hear Israel, hear your father.
001	GEN	049	003	Ruben, thou [art] my first-born, thou my strength, and the first of my children, hard to be endured, [hard and] self-willed.
001	GEN	049	004	Thou wast insolent like water, burst not forth with violence, for thou wentest up to the bed of thy father; then thou defiledst the couch, whereupon thou wentest up.
001	GEN	049	005	Symeon and Levi, brethren, accomplished the injustice of their cutting off.
001	GEN	049	006	Let not my soul come into their counsel, and let not mine inward parts contend in their conspiracy, for in their wrath they slew men, and in their passion they houghed a bull.
001	GEN	049	007	Cursed be their wrath, for it was willful, and their anger, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.
001	GEN	049	008	Juda, thy brethren have praised thee, and thy hands shall be on the back of thine enemies; thy father's sons shall do thee reverence.
001	GEN	049	009	Juda is a lion's whelp: from the tender plant, my son, thou art gone up, having couched thou liest as a lion, and as a whelp; who shall stir him up?

002	EXO	008	026	And Moses said, It cannot be so, for we shall sacrifice to the Lord our God the abominations of the Egyptians; for if we sacrifice the abominations of the Egyptians before them, we shall be stoned.
002	EXO	008	027	We will go a journey of three days into the wilderness, and we will sacrifice to the Lord our God, as the Lord said to us.

002	EXO	008	029	And Moses said, I then will go forth from thee and pray to God, and the dog-fly shall depart both from thy servants, and from thy people to-morrow. Do not thou, Pharao, deceive again, so as not to send the people away to do sacrifice to the Lord.
002	EXO	008	030	And Moses went out from Pharao, and prayed to God.

002	EXO	009	001	And the Lord said to Moses, Go in to Pharao, and thou shalt say to him, These things saith the Lord God of the Hebrews; Send my people away that they may serve me.
002	EXO	009	002	If however thou wilt not send my people away, but yet detainest them:
002	EXO	009	003	behold, the hand of the Lord shall be upon thy cattle in the fields, both on the horses, and on the asses, and on the camels and oxen and sheep, a very great mortality.
002	EXO	009	004	And I will make a marvellous distinction in that time between the cattle of the Egyptians, and the cattle of the children of Israel: nothing shall die of all that is of the children's of Israel.
002	EXO	009	005	And God fixed a limit, saying, To-morrow the Lord will do this thing on the land.
002	EXO	009	006	And the Lord did this thing on the next day, and all the cattle of the Egyptians died, but of the cattle of the children of Israel there died not one.

002	EXO	009	011	And the sorcerers could not stand before Moses because of the sores, for the sores were on the sorcerers, and in all the land of Egypt.
002	EXO	009	012	And the Lord hardened Pharao's heart, and he hearkened not to them, as the Lord appointed.
002	EXO	009	013	And the Lord said to Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharao; and thou shalt say to him, These things saith the Lord God of the Hebrews, Send away my people that they may serve me.
002	EXO	009	014	For at this present time do I send forth all my plagues into thine heart, and the heart of thy servants and of thy people; that thou mayest know that there is not another such as I in all the earth.
002	EXO	009	015	For now I will stretch forth my hand and smite thee and kill thy people, and thou shalt be consumed from off the earth.
002	EXO	009	016	And for this purpose hast thou been preserved, that I might display in thee my strength, and that my name might bepublished in all the earth.
002	EXO	009	017	Dost thou then yet exert thyself to hinder my people, so as not to let them go?

002	EXO	009	020	He of the servants of Pharao that feared the word of the Lord, gathered his cattle into the houses.
002	EXO	009	021	And he that did not attend in his mind to the word of the Lord, left the cattle in the fields.

002	EXO	009	025	And the hail smote in all the land of Egypt both man and beast, and the hail smote all the grass in the field, and the hail broke in pieces all the trees in the field.
002	EXO	009	026	Only in the land of Gesem where the children of Israel were, the hail was not.
002	EXO	009	027	And Pharao sent and called Moses and Aaron, and said to them, I have sinned this time: the Lord [is] righteous, and I and my people are wicked.
002	EXO	009	028	Pray then for me to the Lord, and let him cause the thunderings of God to cease, and the hail and the fire, and I will send you forth and ye shall remain no longer.
002	EXO	009	029	And Moses said to him, When I shall have departed from the city, I will stretch out my hands to the Lord, and the thunderings shall cease, and the hail and the rain shall be no longer, that thou mayest know that the earth [is] the Lord's.
002	EXO	009	030	But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye have not yet feared the Lord.

002	EXO	009	034	And when Pharao saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders ceased, he continued to sin; and [he] hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants.
002	EXO	009	035	And the heart of Pharao was hardened, and he did not send forth the children of Israel, as the Lord said to Moses.
002	EXO	010	001	And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, Go in to Pharao: for I have hardened his heart and the heart of his servants, that these signs may come upon them; in order
002	EXO	010	002	that ye may relate in the ears of your children, and to your children's children, in how many things I have mocked the Egyptians, and my wonders which I wrought among them; and ye shall know that I [am] the Lord.

002	EXO	010	007	And the servants of Pharao say to him, How long shall this be a snare to us? send away the men, that they may serve their God; wilt thou know that Egypt is destroyed?

002	EXO	016	009	And Moses said to Aaron, Say to all the congregation of the children of Israel, Come near before God; for he has heard your murmuring.

002	EXO	016	012	I have heard the murmuring of the children of Israel: speak to them, saying, Towards evening ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be satisfied with bread; and ye shall know that I am the Lord your God.
002	EXO	016	013	And it was evening, and quails came up and covered the camp:
002	EXO	016	014	in the morning it came to pass as the dew ceased round about the camp, that, behold, on the face of the wilderness [was] a small thing like white coriander seed, as frost upon the earth.
002	EXO	016	015	And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, What is this? for they knew not what it was; and Moses said to them,
002	EXO	016	016	This [is] the bread which the Lord has given you to eat. This is that which the Lord has appointed: gather of it each man for his family, a homer for each person, according to the number of your souls, gather each of you with his fellow-lodgers.
002	EXO	016	017	And the children of Israel did so, and gathered some much and some less.

002	EXO	016	019	And Moses said to them, Let no man leave of it till the morning.
002	EXO	016	020	But they did not hearken to Moses, but some left of it till the morning; and it bred worms and stank: and Moses was irritated with them.

002	EXO	016	024	And they left of it till the morning, as Moses commanded them; and it stank not, neither was there a worm in it.
002	EXO	016	025	And Moses said, Eat [that] to-day, for to-day is a sabbath to the Lord: [it] shall not be found in the plain.
002	EXO	016	026	Six days ye shall gather it, and on the seventh day is a sabbath, for there shall be none on that [day].
002	EXO	016	027	And it came to pass on the seventh day [that] some of the people went forth to gather, and found none.

002	EXO	016	029	See, for the Lord has given you this day [as] the sabbath, therefore he has given you on the sixth day the bread of two days: ye shall sit each of you in your houses; let no one go forth from his place on the seventh day.

002	EXO	016	033	And Moses said to Aaron, Take a golden pot, and cast into it one full homer of manna; and thou shalt lay it up before God, to be kept for your generations,
002	EXO	016	034	as the Lord commanded Moses: and Aaron laid it up before the testimony to be kept.

002	EXO	017	005	And the Lord said to Moses, Go before this people, and take to thyself of the elders of the people; and the rod with which thou smotest the river, take in thine hand, and thou shalt go.
002	EXO	017	006	Behold, I stand there before thou [come], on the rock in Choreb, and thou shalt smite the rock, and water shall come out from it, and the people shall drink. And Moses did so before the sons of Israel.

002	EXO	020	005	Thou shalt not bow down to them, nor serve them; for I am the Lord thy God, a jealous God, recompensing the sins of the fathers upon the children, to the third and fourth generation to them that hate me,
002	EXO	020	006	and bestowing mercy on them that love me to thousands [of them], and on them that keep my commandments.
002	EXO	020	007	Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord thy God will not acquit him that takes his name in vain.

002	EXO	020	011	For in six days the Lord made the heaven and the earth, and the sea and all things in them, and rested on the seventh day; therefore the Lord blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it.

002	EXO	020	019	and said to Moses, Speak thou to us, and let not God speak to us, lest we die.
002	EXO	020	020	And Moses says to them, Be of good courage, for God is come to you to try you, that his fear may be among you, that ye sin not.
002	EXO	020	021	And the people stood afar off, and Moses went into the darkness where God was.

003	LEV	004	029	And he shall lay his hand on the head of his sin-offering, and they shall slay the kid of the sin-offering in the place where they slay the [victims for] whole-burnt-offerings.
003	LEV	004	030	And the priest shall take of its blood with his finger, and shall put it on the horns of the altar of whole-burnt-offerings; and all its blood he shall pour forth by the foot of the altar.
003	LEV	004	031	And he shall take away all the fat, as the fat is taken away from the sacrifice of peace-offering, and the priest shall offer it on the altar for a smell of sweet savour to the Lord; and the priest shall make atonement for him, and [his sin] shall be forgiven him.
003	LEV	004	032	And if he should offer a lamb for his sin-offering, he shall offer it a female without blemish.

003	LEV	004	035	And he shall take away all his fat, as the fat of the lamb of the sacrifice of peace-offering is taken away, and the priest shall put it on the altar for a whole-burnt-offering to the Lord; and the priest shall make atonement for him for the sin which he sinned, and it shall be forgiven him.
003	LEV	005	001	And if a soul sin, and hear the voice of swearing, and he is a witness or has seen or been conscious, if he do not report it, he shall bear his iniquity.
003	LEV	005	002	That soul which shall touch any unclean thing, or carcase, or [that which is] unclean being taken of beasts, or the dead bodies of abominable [reptiles] which are unclean, or carcases of unclean cattle,
003	LEV	005	003	or should touch the uncleanness of a man, or whatever kind, which he may touch and be defiled by, and it should have escaped him, but afterwards he should know, —then he shall have transgressed.
003	LEV	005	004	That unrighteous soul, which determines with his lips to do evil or to do good according to whatsoever a man may determine with an oath, and it shall have escaped his notice, and he shall [afterwards] know [it], and [so] he should sin in some one of these things:

003	LEV	005	006	And he shall bring for his transgressions against the Lord, for his sin which he has sinned, a ewe lamb of the flock, or a kid of the goats, for a sin-offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for him for his sin which he has sinned, and his sin shall be forgiven him.
003	LEV	005	007	And if he cannot afford a sheep, he shall bring for his sin which he has sinned, two turtle-doves or two young pigeons to the Lord; one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering.
003	LEV	005	008	And he shall bring them to the priest, and the priest shall bring the sin-offering first; and the priest shall pinch off the head from the neck, and shall not divide the body.
003	LEV	005	009	And he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin-offering on the side of the altar, but the rest of the blood he shall drop at the foot of the altar, for it is a sin-offering.
003	LEV	005	010	And he shall make the second a whole-burnt-offering, as it is fit; and the priest shall make atonement for his sin which he has sinned, and it shall be forgiven him.
003	LEV	005	011	And if he cannot afford a pair of turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, then shall he bring as his gift for his sin, the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin-offering; he shall not pour oil upon it, nor shall he put frankincense upon it, because it is a sin-offering.
003	LEV	005	012	And he shall bring it to the priest; and the priest having taken a handful of it, shall lay the memorial of it on the altar of whole-burnt-offerings to the Lord; it is a sin-offering.
003	LEV	005	013	And the priest shall make atonement for him for his sin, which he has sinned in one of these things, and it shall be forgiven him; and that which is left shall be the priest's, as an offering of fine flour.
003	LEV	005	014	And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
003	LEV	005	015	The soul which shall be really unconscious, and shall sin unwillingly in any of the holy things of the Lord, shall even bring to the Lord for his transgression, a ram of the flock without blemish, valued according to shekels of silver according to the shekel of the sanctuary, for his [transgression] wherein he transgressed.
003	LEV	005	016	And he shall make compensation for that wherein he has sinned in the holy things; and he shall add the fifth part to it, and give it to the priest; and the priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of transgression, and [his sin] shall be forgiven him.
003	LEV	005	017	And the soul which shall sin, and do one thing [against] any of the commandments of the Lord, which it is not right to do, and has not known it, and shall have transgressed, and shall have contracted guilt,
003	LEV	005	018	he shall even bring a ram without blemish from the flock, [valued] at a price of silver for his transgression to the priest; and the priest shall make atonement for his trespass of ignorance, wherein he ignorantly trespassed, and he knew it not; and it shall be forgiven him.
003	LEV	005	019	For he has surely been guilty of transgression before the Lord.
003	LEV	006	001	And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
003	LEV	006	002	The soul which shall have sinned, and willfully overlooked the commandments of the Lord, and shall have dealt falsely in the affairs of his neighbour in the matter of a deposit, or concerning fellowship, or concerning plunder, or has in anything wronged his neighbour,
003	LEV	006	003	or has found that which was lost, and shall have lied concerning it, and shall have sworn unjustly concerning [any] one of all the things, whatsoever a man may do, so as to sin hereby;
003	LEV	006	004	it shall come to pass, whensoever he shall have sinned, and transgressed, that he shall restore the plunder which he has seized, or [redress] the injury which he has committed, or restore the deposit which was entrusted to him, or the lost article which he has found of any kind, about which he swore unjustly, he shall even restore it in full; and he shall add to it a fifth part besides; he shall restore it to him whose it is in the day in which he happens to be convicted.
003	LEV	006	005	And he shall bring to the Lord for his trespass, a ram of the flock, without blemish, of value to the amount of the thing in which he trespassed.
003	LEV	006	006	And the priest shall make atonement for him before the Lord, and he shall be forgiven for any one of all the things which he did and trespassed in it.
003	LEV	006	007	And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
003	LEV	006	008	Charge Aaron and his sons, saying,
003	LEV	006	009	This [is] the law of whole-burnt-offering; this is the whole-burnt-offering in its burning on the altar all the night till the morning; and the fire of the altar shall burn on it, it shall not be put out.
003	LEV	006	010	And the priest shall put on the linen tunic, and he shall put the linen drawers on his body; and shall take away that which has been thoroughly burnt, which the fire shall have consumed, even the whole-burnt-offering from the altar, and he shall put it near the altar.
003	LEV	006	011	And he shall put off his robe, and put on another robe, and he shall take forth the offering that has been burnt without the camp into a clean place.
003	LEV	006	012	And the fire on the altar shall be kept burning on it, and shall not be extinguished; and the priest shall burn on it wood every morning, and shall heap on it the whole-burnt-offering, and shall lay on it the fat of the peace-offering.
003	LEV	006	013	And the fire shall always burn on the altar; it shall not be extinguished.
003	LEV	006	014	This is the law of the sacrifice, which the sons of Aaron shall bring near before the Lord, before the altar.
003	LEV	006	015	And he shall take from it a handful of the fine flour of the sacrifice with its oil, and with all its frankincense, which are upon the sacrifice; and he shall offer up on the altar a burnt-offering as a sweet-smelling savour, a memorial of it to the Lord.
003	LEV	006	016	And Aaron and his sons shall eat that which is left of it: it shall be eaten without leaven in a holy place, they shall eat it in the court of the tabernacle of witness.
003	LEV	006	017	It shall not be baked with leaven. I have given it as a portion to them of the burnt-offerings of the Lord: it is most holy, as the offering for sin, and as the offering for trespass.
003	LEV	006	018	Every male of the priests shall eat it: it is a perpetual ordinance throughout your generations of the burnt-offerings of the Lord; whosoever shall touch them shall be hallowed.
003	LEV	006	019	And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
003	LEV	006	020	This is the gift of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer to the Lord in the day in which thou shalt anoint him; the tenth of an ephah of fine flour for a sacrifice continually, the half of it in the morning, and the half of it in the evening.
003	LEV	006	021	It shall be made with oil in a frying-pan; he shall offer it kneaded [and] in rolls, an offering of fragments, an offering of a sweet savour unto the Lord.
003	LEV	006	022	The anointed priest who is in his place, [one] of his sons, shall offer it: it is a perpetual statute, it shall all be consumed.
003	LEV	006	023	And every sacrifice of a priest shall be thoroughly burnt, and shall not be eaten.
003	LEV	006	024	And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
003	LEV	006	025	Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, This is the law of the sin-offering; —in the place where they slay the whole-burnt-offering, they shall slay the sin-offerings before the Lord: they are most holy.
003	LEV	006	026	The priest that offers it shall eat it: in a holy place it shall be eaten, in the court of the tabernacle of witness.
003	LEV	006	027	Every one that touches the flesh of it shall be holy, and on whosesoever garment any of its blood shall have been sprinkled, whosoever shall have it sprinkled, shall be washed in the holy place.
003	LEV	006	028	And the earthen vessel, in whichsoever it shall have been sodden, shall be broken; and if it shall have been sodden in a brazen vessel, he shall scour it and wash it with water.
003	LEV	006	029	Every male among the priests shall eat it: it is most holy to the Lord.
003	LEV	006	030	And no offerings for sin, of whose blood there shall be brought any into the tabernacle of witness to make atonement in the holy place, shall be eaten: they shall be burned with fire.
003	LEV	007	001	And this [is] the law of the ram for the trespass-offering; it is most holy.
003	LEV	007	002	In the place where they slay the whole-burnt-offering, they shall slay the ram of the trespass-offering before the Lord, and he shall pour out the blood at the bottom of the altar round about.
003	LEV	007	003	And he shall offer all the fat from it; and the loins, and all the fat that covers the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,
003	LEV	007	004	and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, that which is upon the thighs, and the caul upon the liver with the kidney, he shall take them away.
003	LEV	007	005	And the priest shall offer them on the altar a burnt-offering to the Lord; it is for trespass.
003	LEV	007	006	Every male of the priest shall eat them, in the holy place they shall eat them: they are most holy.
003	LEV	007	007	As the sin-offering, so also [is] the trespass-offering. There is one law of them; the priest who shall make atonement with it, his it shall be.
003	LEV	007	008	And [as for] the priest who offers a man's whole-burnt-offering, the skin of the whole-burnt-offering which he offers, shall be his.
003	LEV	007	009	And every sacrifice which shall be prepared in the oven, and every one which shall be prepared on the hearth, or on a frying-pan, it is the property of the priest that offers it; it shall be his.
003	LEV	007	010	And every sacrifice made up with oil, or not made up [with oil], shall belong to the sons of Aaron, an equal portion to each.
003	LEV	007	011	This [is] the law of the sacrifice of peace-offering, which they shall bring to the Lord.
003	LEV	007	012	If a man should offer it for praise, then shall he bring, for the sacrifice of praise, loaves of fine flour made up with oil, and unleavened cakes anointed with oil, and fine flour kneaded with oil.
003	LEV	007	013	With leavened bread he shall offer his gifts, with the peace-offering of praise.
003	LEV	007	014	And he shall bring one of all his gifts, a separate offering to the Lord: it shall belong to the priest who pours forth the blood of the peace-offering.
003	LEV	007	015	And the flesh of the sacrifice of the peace-offering of praise shall be his, and it shall be eaten in the day in which it is offered: they shall not leave of it till the morning.
003	LEV	007	016	And if it be a vow, or he offer his gift of his own will, on whatsoever day he shall offer his sacrifice, it shall be eaten, and on the morrow.
003	LEV	007	017	And that which is left of the flesh of the sacrifice till the third day, shall be consumed with fire.
003	LEV	007	018	And if he do at all eat of the flesh on the third day, it shall not be accepted for him that offers: it shall not be reckoned to him, it is pollution; and whatsoever soul shall eat of it, shall bear his iniquity.
003	LEV	007	019	And whatsoever flesh shall have touched any unclean thing, it shall not be eaten, it shall be consumed with fire; every one that is clean shall eat the flesh.

003	LEV	007	021	And whatsoever soul shall touch any unclean thing, either of the uncleanness of a man, or of unclean quadrupeds, or any unclean abominable thing, and shall eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of the peace-offering, which is the Lord's, that soul shall perish from his people.
003	LEV	007	022	And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
003	LEV	007	023	Speak to the children of Israel, saying, Ye shall eat no fat of oxen or sheep or goats.
003	LEV	007	024	And the fat of such animals as have died of themselves, or have been seized of beasts, may be employed for any work; but it shall not be eaten for food.
003	LEV	007	025	Every one that eats fat off the beasts, from which he will bring a burnt-offering to the Lord—that soul shall perish from his people.
003	LEV	007	026	Ye shall eat no blood in all your habitations, either of beasts or of birds.
003	LEV	007	027	Every soul that shall eat blood, that soul shall perish from his people.
003	LEV	007	028	And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
003	LEV	007	029	Thou shalt also speak to the children of Israel, saying, He that offers a sacrifice of peace-offering, shall bring his gift to the Lord also from the sacrifice of peace-offering.
003	LEV	007	030	His hands shall bring the burnt-offerings to the Lord; the fat which is on the breast and the lobe of the liver, he shall bring them, so as to set them for a gift before the Lord.
003	LEV	007	031	And the priest shall offer the fat upon the altar, and the breast shall be Aaron's and his sons,
003	LEV	007	032	and ye shall give the right shoulder for a choice piece to the priest of your sacrifices of peace-offering.
003	LEV	007	033	He that offers the blood of the peace-offering, and the fat, of the sons of Aaron, his shall be the right shoulder for a portion.
003	LEV	007	034	For I have taken the wave-breast and shoulder of separation from the children of Israel from the sacrifices of your peace-offerings, and I have given them to Aaron the priest and his sons, a perpetual ordinance [due] from the children of Israel.
003	LEV	007	035	This is the anointing of Aaron, and the anointing of his sons, [their portion] of the burnt-offerings of the Lord, in the day in which he brought them forward to minister as priests to the Lord;
003	LEV	007	036	as the Lord commanded to give to them in the day in which he anointed them of the sons of Israel, a perpetual statute through their generations.
003	LEV	007	037	This [is] the law of the whole-burnt-offerings, and of sacrifice, and of sin-offering, and of offering for transgression, and of the sacrifice of consecration, and of the sacrifice of peace-offering;
003	LEV	007	038	as the Lord commanded Moses in the mount Sina, in the day in which he commanded the children of Israel to offer their gifts before the Lord in the wilderness of Sina.
003	LEV	008	001	And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
003	LEV	008	002	Take Aaron and his sons, and his robes and the anointing oil, and the calf for the sin-offering, and the two rams, and the basket of unleavened bread,
003	LEV	008	003	and assemble the whole congregation at the door of the tabernacle of witness.
003	LEV	008	004	And Moses did as the Lord appointed him, and he assembled the congregation at the door of the tabernacle of witness.
003	LEV	008	005	And Moses said to the congregation, This is the thing which the Lord has commanded you to do.
003	LEV	008	006	And Moses brought nigh Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water,
003	LEV	008	007	and put on him the coat, and girded him with the girdle, and clothed him with the tunic, and put on him the ephod;
003	LEV	008	008	and girded him [with a girdle] according to the make of the ephod, and clasped him closely with it: and put upon it the oracle, and put upon the oracle the Manifestation and the Truth.
003	LEV	008	009	And he put the mitre on his head, and put upon the mitre in front the golden plate, the most holy thing, as the Lord commanded Moses.
003	LEV	008	010	And Moses took of the anointing oil,
003	LEV	008	011	and sprinkled of it seven times on the altar; and anointed the altar, and hallowed it, and all things on it, and the laver, and its foot, and sanctified them; and anointed the tabernacle and all its furniture, and hallowed it.
003	LEV	008	012	And Moses poured of the anointing oil on the head of Aaron; and he anointed him and sanctified him.
003	LEV	008	013	And Moses brought the sons of Aaron near, and put on them coast and girded them with girdles, and put on them bonnets, as the Lord commanded Moses.
003	LEV	008	014	And Moses brought near the calf for the sin-offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the calf of the sin-offering.
003	LEV	008	015	And he slew it; and Moses took of the blood, and put it on the horns of the altar round about with his finger; and he purified the altar, and poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar, and sanctified it, to make atonement upon it.
003	LEV	008	016	And Moses took all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the lobe on the liver, and both the kidneys, and the fat that was upon them, and Moses offered them on the altar.
003	LEV	008	017	But the calf, and his hide, and his flesh, and his dung, he burnt with fire without the camp, as the Lord commanded Moses.
003	LEV	008	018	And Moses brought near the ram for a whole-burnt-offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram. And Moses slew the ram: and Moses poured the blood on the altar round about.
003	LEV	008	019	And he divided the ram by its limbs, and Moses offered the head, and the limbs, and the fat; and he washed the belly and the feet with water.
003	LEV	008	020	And Moses offered up the whole ram on the altar: it is a whole-burnt-offering for a sweet-smelling savour; it is a burnt-offering to the Lord, as the Lord commanded Moses.
003	LEV	008	021	And Moses brought the second ram, the ram of consecration, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram, and [he] slew him;
003	LEV	008	022	and Moses took of his blood, and put it upon the tip of Aaron's right ear, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the great toe of his right foot.
003	LEV	008	023	And Moses brought near the sons of Aaron; and Moses put of the blood on the tips of their right ears, and on the thumbs of their right hands, and on the great toes of their right feet, and Moses poured out the blood on the altar round about.
003	LEV	008	024	And he took the fat, and the rump, and the fat on the belly, and the lobe of the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and the right shoulder.
003	LEV	008	025	And from the basket of consecration, which was before the Lord, he also took one unleavened loaf, and one loaf made with oil, and one cake; and put [them] upon the fat, and the right shoulder:
003	LEV	008	026	and put them all on the hands of Aaron, and upon the hands of his sons, and offered them up for a wave-offering before the Lord.
003	LEV	008	027	And Moses took them at their hands, and Moses offered them on the altar, on the whole-burnt-offering of consecration, which is a smell of sweet savour: it is a burnt-offering to the Lord.
003	LEV	008	028	And Moses took the breast, and separated it for a heave-offering before the Lord, from the ram of consecration; and it became Moses' portion, as the Lord commanded Moses.
003	LEV	008	029	And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood that was on the altar, and sprinkled it on Aaron, and on his garments, and his sons, and the garments of his sons with him.
003	LEV	008	030	And he sanctified Aaron and his garments, and his sons, and the garments of his sons with him.
003	LEV	008	031	And Moses said to Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh in the tent of the tabernacle of witness in the holy place; and there ye shall eat it and the loaves in the basket of consecration, as it has been appointed me, [the Lord] saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat them.
003	LEV	008	032	And that which is left of the flesh and of the loaves burn ye with fire.
003	LEV	008	033	And ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of witness for seven days, until the day be fulfilled, the day of your consecration; for in seven days shall he consecrate you,
003	LEV	008	034	as he did in this day on which the Lord commanded me to do so, to make an atonement for you.
003	LEV	008	035	And ye shall remain seven days at the door of the tabernacle of witness, day and night; ye shall observe the ordinances of the Lord, that ye die not; for so has the Lord God commanded me.
003	LEV	008	036	And Aaron and his sons performed all these commands which the Lord commanded Moses.
003	LEV	009	001	And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel,
003	LEV	009	002	and Moses said to Aaron, Take to thyself a young calf of the herd for a sin-offering, and a ram for a whole-burnt-offering, unblemished, and offer them before the Lord.
003	LEV	009	003	And speak to the elders of Israel, saying, Take one kid of the goats for a sin-offering, and a young calf, and a lamb of a year old for a whole-burnt-offering, spotless,
003	LEV	009	004	and a calf and a ram for a peace offering before the Lord, and fine flour mingled with oil, for to-day the Lord will appear among you.
003	LEV	009	005	And they took as Moses commanded them before the tabernacle of witness, and all the congregation drew nigh, and they stood before the Lord.
003	LEV	009	006	And Moses said, This is the thing which the Lord has spoken; do [it], and the glory of the Lord shall appear among you.
003	LEV	009	007	And Moses said to Aaron, Draw nigh to the altar, and offer thy sin-offering, and thy whole-burnt-offering, and make atonement for thyself, and for thy house; and offer the gifts of the people, and make atonement for them, as the Lord commanded Moses.
003	LEV	009	008	And Aaron drew nigh to the altar, and slew the calf of his sin-offering.
003	LEV	009	009	And the sons of Aaron brought the blood to him, and he dipped his finger into the blood, and put it on the horns of the altar, and he poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar.
003	LEV	009	010	And he offered up on the altar the fat and the kidneys and the lobe of the liver of the sin-offering, according as the Lord commanded Moses.
003	LEV	009	011	And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire outside of the camp.
003	LEV	009	012	And he slew the whole-burnt-offering; and the sons of Aaron brought the blood to him, and he poured it on the altar round about.
003	LEV	009	013	And they brought the whole-burnt-offering, according to its pieces; them and the head he put upon the altar.
003	LEV	009	014	And he washed the belly and the feet with water, and he put them on the whole-burnt-offering on the altar.
003	LEV	009	015	And he brought the gift of the people, and took the goat of the sin-offering of the people, and slew it, and purified it as also the first.
003	LEV	009	016	And he brought the whole-burnt-offering, and offered it in due form.
003	LEV	009	017	And he brought the sacrifice and filled his hands with it, and laid it on the altar, besides the morning whole-burnt-offering.
003	LEV	009	018	And he slew the calf, and the ram of the sacrifice of peace-offering of the people; and the sons of Aaron brought the blood to him, and he poured it out on the altar round about.
003	LEV	009	019	And [he took] the fat of the calf, and the hind quarters of the ram, and the fat covering the belly, and the two kidneys, and the fat upon them, and the caul on the liver.
003	LEV	009	020	And he put the fat on the breasts, and offered the fat on the altar.
003	LEV	009	021	And Aaron separated the breast and the right shoulder as a choice-offering before the Lord, as the Lord commanded Moses.
003	LEV	009	022	And Aaron lifted up his hands on the people and blessed them; and after he had offered the sin-offering, and the whole-burnt-offerings, and the peace-offerings, he came down.
003	LEV	009	023	And Moses and Aaron entered into the tabernacle of witness. And they came out and blessed all the people, and the glory of the Lord appeared to all the people.
003	LEV	009	024	And fire came forth from the Lord, and devoured the offerings on the altar, both the whole-burnt-offerings and the fat; and all the people saw, and were amazed, and fell upon their faces.
003	LEV	010	001	And the two sons of Aaron, Nadab and Abiud, took each his censer, and put fire therein, and threw incense thereon, and offered strange fire before the Lord, which the Lord did not command them,
003	LEV	010	002	and fire came forth from the Lord, and devoured them, and they died before the Lord.
003	LEV	010	003	And Moses said to Aaron, This is the thing which the Lord spoke, saying, I will be sanctified among them that draw night to me, and I will be glorified in the whole congregation; and Aaron was pricked [in his heart].
003	LEV	010	004	And Moses called Misadae, and Elisaphan, sons of Oziel, sons of the brother of Aaron's father, and said to them, Draw near and take your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp.
003	LEV	010	005	And they came near and took them in their coats out of the camp, as Moses said.
003	LEV	010	006	And Moses said to Aaron, and Eleazar and Ithamar his sons that were left, Ye shall not make bare your heads, and ye shall not tear your garments; that ye die not, and [so] there should be wrath on all the congregation: but your brethren, [even] all the house of Israel, shall lament for the burning, with which they were burnt by the Lord.
003	LEV	010	007	And ye shall not go forth from the door of the tabernacle of witness, that ye die not; for the Lord's anointing oil [is] upon you: and they did according to the word of Moses.
003	LEV	010	008	And the Lord spoke to Aaron, saying,
003	LEV	010	009	Ye shall not drink wine nor strong drink, thou and thy sons with thee, whensoever ye enter into the tabernacle of witness, or when ye approach the altar, so shall ye not die; [it is] a perpetual statute for your generations,
003	LEV	010	010	to distinguish between sacred and profane, and between clean and unclean,
003	LEV	010	011	and to teach the children of Israel all the statutes, which the Lord spoke to them by Moses.
003	LEV	010	012	And Moses said to Aaron, and to Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron who survived, Take the sacrifice that is left of the burnt-offerings of the Lord, and ye shall eat unleavened bread by the altar: it is most holy.
003	LEV	010	013	And ye shall eat it in the holy place; for this is a statute for thee and a statute for thy sons, of the burnt-offerings to the Lord; for so it has been commanded me.
003	LEV	010	014	And ye shall eat the breast of separation, and the shoulder of the choice-offering in the holy place, thou and thy sons and thy house with thee; for it has been given as an ordinance for thee and an ordinance for thy sons, of the sacrifices of peace-offering of the children of Israel.
003	LEV	010	015	They shall bring the shoulder of the choice-offering, and the breast of the separation upon the burnt-offerings of the fat, to separate for a separation before the Lord; and it shall be a perpetual ordinance for thee and thy sons and thy daughters with thee, as the Lord commanded Moses.
003	LEV	010	016	And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin-offering, but it had been consumed by fire; and Moses was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar the sons of Aaron that were left, saying,
003	LEV	010	017	Why did ye not eat the sin-offering in the holy place? for because it is most holy he has given you this to eat, that ye might take away the sin of the congregation, and make atonement for them before the Lord.
003	LEV	010	018	For the blood of it was not brought into the holy place: ye shall eat it within, before [the Lord], as the Lord commanded me.
003	LEV	010	019	And Aaron spoke to Moses, saying, If they have brought nigh to-day their sin-offerings, and their whole-burnt-offerings before the Lord, and these events have happened to me, and [yet] I should eat to-day of the sin-offerings, would it be pleasing to the Lord?
003	LEV	010	020	And Moses heard [it], and it pleased him.
003	LEV	011	001	And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,
003	LEV	011	002	Speak ye to the sons of Israel, saying, These are the beasts which ye shall eat of all beasts that are upon the earth.
003	LEV	011	003	Every beast parting the hoof and making divisions of two claws, and chewing the cud among beasts, these ye shall eat.
003	LEV	011	004	But of these ye shall not eat, of those that chew the cud, and of those that part the hoofs, and divide claws; the camel, because it chews the cud, but does not divide the hoof, this is unclean to you.
003	LEV	011	005	And the rabbit, because it chews the cud, but does not divide the hoof, this is unclean to you.
003	LEV	011	006	And the hare, because it does not chew the cud, and does not divide the hoof, this is unclean to you.
003	LEV	011	007	And the swine, because this [animal] divides the hoof, and makes claws of the hoof, and it does not chew the cud, is unclean to you.
003	LEV	011	008	Ye shall not eat of their flesh, and ye shall not touch their carcases; these are unclean to you.
003	LEV	011	009	And these [are] what ye shall eat of all that are in the waters: all things that have fins and scales in the waters, and in the seas, and in the brooks, these ye shall eat.
003	LEV	011	010	And all things which have not fins or scales in the water, or in the seas, and in the brooks, of all which the waters produce, and of every soul living in the water, are an abomination; and they shall be abominations to you.
003	LEV	011	011	Ye shall not eat of their flesh, and ye shall abhor their carcases.
003	LEV	011	012	And all things that have not fins or scales of those that are in the waters, these are an abomination to you.
003	LEV	011	013	And these are the things which ye shall abhor of birds, and they shall not be eaten, they are an abomination: the eagle and the ossifrage, and the sea-eagle.
003	LEV	011	014	And the vulture, and the kite, and the like to it;
003	LEV	011	015	and the sparrow, and the owl, and the sea-mew, and the like to it:
003	LEV	011	016	and every raven, and the birds like it, and the hawk and his like,
003	LEV	011	017	and the night-raven and the cormorant and the stork,
003	LEV	011	018	and the red-bill, and the pelican, and swan,
003	LEV	011	019	and the heron, and the lapwing, and the like to it, and the hoopoe and the bat.
003	LEV	011	020	And all winged creatures that creep, which go upon four feet, are abominations to you.
003	LEV	011	021	But these ye shall eat of the creeping winged animals, which go upon four feet, which have legs above their feet, to leap with on the earth.
003	LEV	011	022	And these of them ye shall eat: the caterpillar and his like, and the attacus and his like, and the cantharus and his like, and the locust and his like.
003	LEV	011	023	Every creeping thing from among the birds, which has four feet, is an abomination to you.
003	LEV	011	024	And by these ye shall be defiled; every one that touches their carcases shall be unclean till the evening.
003	LEV	011	025	And every one that takes of their dead bodies shall wash his garments, and shall be unclean till the evening.
003	LEV	011	026	And whichever among the beasts divides the hoof and makes claws, and does not chew the cud, shall be unclean to you; every one that touches their dead bodies shall be unclean till evening.
003	LEV	011	027	And every one among all the wild beasts that moves upon its fore feet, which goes on all four, is unclean to you; every one that touches their dead bodies shall be unclean till evening.
003	LEV	011	028	And he that takes of their dead bodies shall wash his garments, and shall be unclean till evening: these are unclean to you.
003	LEV	011	029	And these [are] unclean to you of reptiles upon the earth, the weasel, and the mouse, and the lizard,
003	LEV	011	030	the ferret, and the chameleon, and the evet, and the newt, and the mole.
003	LEV	011	031	These are unclean to you of all the reptiles which are on the earth; every one who touches their carcases shall be unclean till evening.
003	LEV	011	032	And on whatsoever one of their dead bodies shall fall it shall be unclean; whatever wooden vessel, or garment, or skin, or sack it may be, every vessel in which work should be done, shall be dipped in water, and shall be unclean till evening; and [then] it shall be clean.
003	LEV	011	033	And every earthen vessel into which one of these things shall fall, whatsoever is inside it, shall be unclean, and it shall be broken.
003	LEV	011	034	And all food that is eaten, on which water shall come [from such a vessel], shall be unclean; and every beverage which is drunk in any [such] vessel, shall be unclean.
003	LEV	011	035	And every thing on which there shall fall of their dead bodies shall be unclean; ovens and stands for jars shall be broken down: these are unclean, and they shall be unclean to you.
003	LEV	011	036	Only [if the water be] of fountains of water, or a pool, or confluence of water, it shall be clean; but he that touches their carcases shall be unclean.
003	LEV	011	037	And if one of their carcases should fall upon any sowing seed which shall be sown, it shall be clean.
003	LEV	011	038	But if water be poured on any seed, and one of their dead bodies fall upon it, it is unclean to you.
003	LEV	011	039	And if one of the cattle die, which it is lawful for you to eat, he that touches their carcases shall be unclean till evening.
003	LEV	011	040	And he that eats of their carcases shall wash his garments, and be unclean till evening; and he that carries any of their carcases shall wash his garments, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean till evening.
003	LEV	011	041	And every reptile that creeps on the earth, this shall be an abomination to you; it shall not be eaten.
003	LEV	011	042	And every [animal] that creeps on its belly, and every one that goes on four [feet] continually, which abounds with feet among all the reptiles creeping upon the earth—ye shall not eat it, for it is an abomination to you.
003	LEV	011	043	And ye shall not defile your souls with any of the reptiles that creep upon the earth, and ye shall not be polluted with them, and ye shall not be unclean by them.
003	LEV	011	044	For I am the Lord your God; and ye shall be sanctified, and ye shall be holy, because I the Lord your God am holy; and ye shall not defile your souls with any of the reptiles creeping upon the earth.
003	LEV	011	045	For I am the Lord who brought you up out of the land of Egypt to be your God; and ye shall be holy, for I the Lord am holy.
003	LEV	011	046	This is the law concerning beasts and birds and every living creature moving in the water, and every living creature creeping on the earth;
003	LEV	011	047	to distinguish between the unclean and the clean; and between those that bring forth alive, such as should be eaten, and those that bring forth alive, such as should not be eaten.
003	LEV	012	001	And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
003	LEV	012	002	Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them, Whatsoever woman shall have conceived and born a male child shall be unclean seven days, she shall be unclean according to the days of separation for her monthly courses.
003	LEV	012	003	And on the eighth day she shall circumcise the flesh of his foreskin.
003	LEV	012	004	And for thirty-three days she shall continue in her unclean blood; she shall touch nothing holy, and shall not enter the sanctuary, until the days of her purification be fulfilled.
003	LEV	012	005	But if she should have born a female child, then she shall be unclean twice seven days, according to the time of her monthly courses; and for sixty-six days shall she remain in her unclean blood.
003	LEV	012	006	And when the days of her purification shall have been fulfilled for a son or a daughter, she shall bring a lamb of a year old without blemish for a whole-burnt-offering, and a young pigeon or turtle-dove for a sin-offering to the door of the tabernacle of witness, to the priest.
003	LEV	012	007	And he shall present it before the Lord, and the priest shall make atonement for her, and shall purge her from the fountain of her blood; this is the law of her who bears a male or a female.
003	LEV	012	008	And if she cannot afford a lamb, then shall she take two turtle-doves or two young pigeons, one for a whole-burnt-offering, and one for a sin-offering; and the priest shall make atonement for her, and she shall be purified.
003	LEV	013	001	And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,
003	LEV	013	002	If any man should have in the skin of his flesh a bright clear spot, and there should be in the skin of his flesh a plague of leprosy, he shall be brought to Aaron the priest, or to one of his sons the priests.
003	LEV	013	003	And the priest shall view the spot in the skin of his flesh; and [if] the hair in the spot be changed [to] white, and the appearance of the spot be below the skin of the flesh, it is a plague of leprosy; and the priest shall look upon it, and pronounce him unclean.
003	LEV	013	004	But if the spot be clear and white in the skin of his flesh, yet the appearance of it be not deep below the skin, and its hair have not changed [itself for] white hair, but it is dark, then the priest shall separate [him that has] the spot seven days;
003	LEV	013	005	and the priest shall look on the spot the seventh day; and, behold, [if] the spot remains before him, [if] the spot has not spread in the skin, then the priest shall separate him the second time seven days.
003	LEV	013	006	And the priest shall look upon him the second time on the seventh day; and, behold, [if] the spot be dark, [and] the spot have not spread in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean; for it is a [mere] mark, and the man shall wash his garments and be clean.
003	LEV	013	007	But if the bright spot should have changed and spread in the skin, after the priest has seen him for the purpose of purifying him, then shall he appear the second time to the priest,
003	LEV	013	008	and the priest shall look upon him; and, behold, [if] the mark have spread in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a leprosy.
003	LEV	013	009	And if a man have a plague of leprosy, then he shall come to the priest;
003	LEV	013	010	and the priest shall look, and, behold, if it is a white spot in the skin, and it has changed the hair to white, and [there be] some of the sound part of the quick flesh in the sore—
003	LEV	013	011	it is a leprosy waxing old in the skin of the flesh; and the priest shall pronounce him unclean, and shall separate him, because he is unclean.
003	LEV	013	012	And if the leprosy should have come out very evidently in the skin, and the leprosy should cover all the skin of the patient from the head to the feet, wheresoever the priest shall look;
003	LEV	013	013	then the priest shall look, and, behold, the leprosy has covered all the skin of the flesh; and the priest shall pronounce him clean of the plague, because it has changed all to white, it is clean.
003	LEV	013	014	But on whatsoever day the quick flesh shall appear on him, he shall be pronounced unclean.
003	LEV	013	015	And the priest shall look upon the sound flesh, and the sound flesh shall prove him to be unclean; for it is unclean, it is a leprosy.
003	LEV	013	016	But if the sound flesh be restored and changed [to] white, then shall he come to the priest;
003	LEV	013	017	and the priest shall see [him], and, behold, [if] the plague is turned white, then the priest shall pronounce the patient clean: he is clean.
003	LEV	013	018	And if the flesh should have become an ulcer in his skin, and should be healed,
003	LEV	013	019	and there should be in the place of the ulcer a white sore, or [one] looking white and bright, or fiery, and it shall be seen by the priest;
003	LEV	013	020	then the priest shall look, and, behold, if the appearance be beneath the skin, and its hair has changed to white, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; because it is a leprosy, it has broken out in the ulcer.
003	LEV	013	021	But if the priest look, and behold there is no white hair on it, and it be not below the skin of the flesh, and it be dark-coloured; then the priest shall separate him seven days.
003	LEV	013	022	But if it manifestly spread over the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a plague of leprosy; it has broken out in the ulcer.
003	LEV	013	023	But if the bright spot should remain in its place and not spread, it is the scar of the ulcer; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.
003	LEV	013	024	And if the flesh be in his skin [in a state of] fiery inflammation, and there should be in his skin the part which is healed of the inflammation, bright, clear, and white, suffused with red or very white;
003	LEV	013	025	then the priest shall look upon him, and, behold, [if] the hair being white is changed to a bright colour, and its appearance is lower than the skin, it is a leprosy; it has broken out in the inflammation, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a plague of leprosy.
003	LEV	013	026	But if the priest should look, and, behold, there is not in the bright spot any white hair, and it should not be lower than the skin, and it should be dark, then the priest shall separate him seven days.
003	LEV	013	027	And the priest shall look upon him on the seventh day; and if the spot be much spread in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a plague of leprosy, it has broken out in the ulcer.
003	LEV	013	028	But if the bright spot remain stationary, and be not spread in the skin, but [the sore] should be dark, it is a scar of inflammation; and the priest shall pronounce him clean, for it is the mark of the inflammation.
003	LEV	013	029	And if a man or a woman have in them a plague of leprosy in the head or the beard;
003	LEV	013	030	then the priest shall look on the plague, and, behold, [if] the appearance of it be beneath the skin, and in it there be thin yellowish hair, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a scurf, it is a leprosy of the head or a leprosy of the beard.
003	LEV	013	031	And if the priest should see the plague of the scurf, and, behold, the appearance of it be not beneath the skin, and there is no yellowish hair in it, then the priest shall set apart [him that has] the plague of the scurf seven days.
003	LEV	013	032	And the priest shall look at the plague on the seventh day; and, behold, [if] the scurf be not spread, and there be no yellowish hair on it, and the appearance of the scurf is not hollow under the skin;
003	LEV	013	033	then the skin shall be shaven, but the scurf shall not be shaven; and the priest shall set aside the person having the scurf the second time for seven days.
003	LEV	013	034	And the priest shall see the scurf on the seventh day; and, behold, [if] the scurf is not spread in the skin after the man's being shaved, and the appearance of the scurf is not hollow beneath the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean; and he shall wash his garments, and be clean.
003	LEV	013	035	But if the scurf be indeed spread in the skin after he has been purified,
003	LEV	013	036	then the priest shall look, and, behold, [if] the scurf be spread in the skin, the priest shall not examine concerning the yellow hair, for he is unclean.
003	LEV	013	037	But if the scurf remain before [him] in its place, and a dark hair should have arisen in it, the scurf is healed: he is clean, and the priest shall pronounce him clean.
003	LEV	013	038	And if a man or woman should have in the skin of their flesh spots of a bright whiteness,
003	LEV	013	039	then the priest shall look; and, behold, there [being] bright spots of a bright whiteness in the skin of their flesh, it is a tetter; it burst forth in the skin of his flesh; he is clean.
003	LEV	013	040	And if any one's head should lose the hair, he is [only] bald, he is clean.
003	LEV	013	041	And if his head should lose the hair in front, he is forehead bald: he is clean.
003	LEV	013	042	And if there should be in his baldness of head, or his baldness of forehead, a white or fiery plague, it is leprosy in his baldness of head, or baldness of forehead.
003	LEV	013	043	And the priest shall look upon him, and, behold, if the appearance of the plague be white or inflamed in his baldness of head or baldness in front, as the appearance of leprosy in the skin of his flesh,
003	LEV	013	044	he is a leprous man: the priest shall surely pronounce him unclean, his plague is in his head.
003	LEV	013	045	And the leper in whom the plague is, let his garments be ungirt, and his head uncovered; and let him have a covering put upon his mouth, and he shall be called unclean.
003	LEV	013	046	All the days in which the plague shall be upon him, being unclean, he shall be [esteemed] unclean; he shall dwell apart, his place of sojourn shall be without the camp.
003	LEV	013	047	And if a garment have in it the plague of leprosy, a garment of wool, or a garment of flax,
003	LEV	013	048	either in the warp or in the woof, or in the linen, or in the woollen threads, or in a skin, or in any workmanship of skin,
003	LEV	013	049	and the plague be greenish or reddish in the skin, or in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any utensil of skin, it is a plague of leprosy, and he shall show it to the priest.
003	LEV	013	050	And the priest shall look upon the plague, and the priest shall set apart [that which has] the plague seven days.
003	LEV	013	051	And the priest shall look upon the plague on the seventh day; and if the plague be spread in the garment, either in the warp or in the woof, or in the skin, in whatsoever things skins may be used in their workmanship, the plague is a confirmed leprosy; it is unclean.
003	LEV	013	052	He shall burn the garment, either the warp or woof in woollen garments or in flaxen, or in any utensil of skin, in which there may be the plague; because it is a confirmed leprosy; it shall be burnt with fire.
003	LEV	013	053	And if the priest should see, and the plague be not spread in the garments, either in the warp or in the woof, or in any utensil of skin,
003	LEV	013	054	then the priest shall give directions, and [one] shall wash that on which there may have been the plague, and the priest shall set it aside a second time for seven days.
003	LEV	013	055	And the priest shall look upon it after the plague has been washed; and [if] this, even the plague, has not changed its appearance, and the plague does not spread, it is unclean; it shall be burnt with fire: it is fixed in the garment, in the warp, or in the woof.
003	LEV	013	056	And if the priest should look, and the spot be dark after it has been washed, he shall tear it off from the garment, either from the warp or from the woof, or from the skin.
003	LEV	013	057	And if it should still appear in the garment, either in the warp or in the woof, or in any article of skin, it is a leprosy bursting forth: that wherein is the plague shall be burnt with fire.
003	LEV	013	058	And the garment, or the warp, or the woof, or any article of skin, which shall be washed, and the plague depart from it, shall also be washed again, and shall be clean.
003	LEV	013	059	This is the law of the plague of leprosy of a woollen or linen garment, either of the warp, or woof, or any leathern article, to pronounce it clean or unclean.
003	LEV	014	001	And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
003	LEV	014	002	This is the law of the leper: in whatsoever day he shall have been cleansed, then shall he be brought to the priest.
003	LEV	014	003	And the priest shall come forth out of the camp, and the priest shall look, and, behold, the plague of the leprosy is removed from the leper.
003	LEV	014	004	And the priest shall give directions, and they shall take for him that is cleansed two clean live birds, and cedar wood, and spun scarlet, and hyssop.
003	LEV	014	005	And the priest shall give direction, and they shall kill one bird over an earthen vessel over running water.
003	LEV	014	006	And as for the living bird he shall take it, and the cedar wood, and the spun scarlet, and the hyssop, and he shall dip them and the living bird into the blood of the bird that was slain over running water.
003	LEV	014	007	And he shall sprinkle seven times upon him that was cleansed of his leprosy, and he shall be clean; and he shall let go the living bird into the field.
003	LEV	014	008	and the man that has been cleansed shall wash his garments, and shall shave off all his hair, and shall wash himself in water, and shall be clean; and after that he shall go into the camp, and shall remain out of his house seven days.
003	LEV	014	009	And it shall come to pass on the seventh day, he shall shave off all his hair, his head and his beard, and his eye-brows, even all his hair shall he shave; and he shall wash his garments, and wash his body with water, and shall be clean.
003	LEV	014	010	And on the eighth day he shall take two lambs without spot of a year old, and one ewe lamp without spot of a year old, and three-tenths of fine flour for sacrifice kneaded with oil, and one small cup of oil.
003	LEV	014	011	And the priest that cleanses shall present the man under purification, and these [offerings] before the Lord, at the door of the tabernacle of witness.
003	LEV	014	012	And the priest shall take one lamb, and offer him for a trespass-offering, and the cup of oil, and set them apart for a special offering before the Lord.
003	LEV	014	013	and they shall kill the lamb in the place where they kill the whole-burnt-offerings, and the sin-offerings, in the holy places; for it is a sin-offering: as the trespass-offering, it belongs to the priest, it is most holy.
003	LEV	014	014	And the priest shall take of the blood of the trespass-offering, and the priest shall put it on the tip of the right ear of the person under cleansing, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the great toe of his right foot.
003	LEV	014	015	And the priest shall take of the cup of oil, and shall pour it upon his own left hand.

003	LEV	014	033	And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,
003	LEV	014	034	Whensoever ye shall enter into the land of the Chananites, which I give you for a possession, and I shall put the plague of leprosy in the houses of the land of your possession;
003	LEV	014	035	then the owner of the house shall come and report to the priest, saying, I have seen as it were a plague in the house.
003	LEV	014	036	And the priest shall give orders to remove the furniture of the house, before the priest comes in to see the plague, and [thus] none of the things in the house shall become unclean; and afterwards the priest shall go in to examine the house.
003	LEV	014	037	And he shall look on the plague, and, behold, [if] the plague is in the walls of the house, [he will see] greenish or reddish cavities, and the appearance of them [will be] beneath the surface of the walls.

003	LEV	015	002	Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them, Whatever man shall have an issue out of his body, his issue is unclean.
003	LEV	015	003	And this [is] the law of his uncleanness; whoever has a gonorrhoea out of his body, this is his uncleanness in him by reason of the issue, by which, his body is affected through the issue: all the days of the issue of his body, by which his body is affected through the issue, there is his uncleanness.
003	LEV	015	004	Every bed on which he that has the issue shall happen to lie, is unclean; and every seat on which he that has the issue may happen to sit, shall be unclean.

003	LEV	015	014	And on the eighth day he shall take to himself two turtle-doves or two young pigeons, and he shall bring them before the Lord to the doors of the tabernacle of witness, and shall give them to the priest.
003	LEV	015	015	And the priest shall offer them one for a sin-offering, and the other for a whole-burnt-offering; and the priest shall make atonement for him before the Lord for his issue.

003	LEV	015	024	And if any one shall lie with her, and her uncleanness be upon him, he shall be unclean seven days; and every bed on which he shall have lain shall be unclean.
003	LEV	015	025	And if a woman have an issue of blood many days, not in the time of her separation; if the blood should also flow after her separation, all the days of the issue of her uncleanness [shall be] as the days of her separation: she shall be unclean.

003	LEV	015	032	This is the law of the man who has an issue, and if one discharge seed of copulation, so that he should be polluted by it.
003	LEV	015	033	And [this is the law] for her that has the issue of blood in her separation, and as to the person who has an issue of seed, in his issue: [it is a law] for the male and the female, and for the man who shall have lain with her that is set apart.
003	LEV	016	001	And the Lord spoke to Moses after the two sons of Aaron died in bringing strange fire before the Lord, so they died.
003	LEV	016	002	And the Lord said to Moses, Speak to Aaron thy brother, and let him not come in at all times into the holy place within the veil before the propitiatory, which is upon the ark of the testimony, and he shall not die; for I will appear in a cloud on the propitiatory.
003	LEV	016	003	Thus shall Aaron enter into the holy place; with a calf of the herd for a sin-offering, and [having] a ram for a whole-burnt-offering.

003	LEV	016	007	And he shall take the two goats, and place them before the Lord by the door of the tabernacle of witness.
003	LEV	016	008	and Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats, one lot for the Lord, and the other for the scape-goat.
003	LEV	016	009	And Aaron shall bring forward the goat on which the lot for the Lord fell, and shall offer him for a sin-offering.
003	LEV	016	010	and the goat upon which the lot of the scape-goat came, he shall present alive before the Lord, to make atonement upon him, so as to send him away as a scape-goat, and he shall send him into the wilderness.
003	LEV	016	011	And Aaron shall bring the calf for his sin, and he shall make atonement for himself and for his house, and he shall kill the calf for his sin-offering.
003	LEV	016	012	And he shall take his censer full of coals of fire off the altar, which is before the Lord; and he shall fill his hands with fine compound incense, and shall bring it within the veil.
003	LEV	016	013	And he shall put the incense on the fire before the Lord, and the smoke of the incense shall cover the mercy-seat over the tables of testimony, and he shall not die.
003	LEV	016	014	And he shall take of the blood of the calf, and sprinkle with his finger on the mercy-seat eastward: before the mercy-seat shall he sprinkle seven times of the blood with his finger.
003	LEV	016	015	And he shall kill the goat for the sin-offering that is for the people, before the Lord; and he shall bring in of its blood within the veil, and shall do with its blood as he did with the blood of the calf, and shall sprinkle its blood on the mercy-seat, in front of the mercy-seat.
003	LEV	016	016	and he shall make atonement for the sanctuary on account of the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and for their trespasses in the matter of all their sins; and thus shall he do to the tabernacle of witness established among them in the midst of their uncleanness.
003	LEV	016	017	and there shall be no man in the tabernacle of witness, when he goes in to make atonement in the holy place, until he shall have come out; and he shall make atonement for himself, and for his house, and for all the congregation of the children of Israel.
003	LEV	016	018	And he shall come forth to the altar that is before the Lord, and he shall make atonement upon it; and he shall take of the blood of the calf, and of the blood of the goat, and shall put it on the horns of the altar round about.
003	LEV	016	019	And he shall sprinkle some of the blood upon it seven times with his finger, and shall purge it, and hallow it from the uncleanness of the children of Israel.
003	LEV	016	020	And he shall finish making atonement for the sanctuary and for the tabernacle of witness, and for the altar; and he shall make a cleansing for the priests, and he shall bring the living goat;
003	LEV	016	021	and Aaron shall lay his hands on the head of the live goat, and he shall declare over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their unrighteousness, and all their sins; and he shall lay them upon the head of the live goat, and shall send him by the hand of a ready man into the wilderness.
003	LEV	016	022	And the goat shall bear their unrighteousnesses upon him into a desert land; and Aaron shall send away the goat into the wilderness.
003	LEV	016	023	And Aaron shall enter into the tabernacle of witness, and shall put off the linen garment, which he had put on, as he entered into the holy place, and shall lay it by there.
003	LEV	016	024	And he shall bathe his body in water in the holy place, and shall put on his raiment, and shall go out and offer the whole-burnt-offering for himself and the whole-burnt-offering for the people: and shall make atonement for himself and for his house, and for the people, as for the priests.
003	LEV	016	025	And he shall offer the fat for the sin-offering on the altar.
003	LEV	016	026	And he that sends forth the goat that has been set apart to be let go, shall wash his garments, and bathe his body in water, and afterwards shall enter into the camp.
003	LEV	016	027	And the calf for the sin-offering, and the goat for the sin-offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the holy place, they shall carry forth out of the camp, and burn them with fire, even their skins and their flesh and their dung.
003	LEV	016	028	And he that burns them shall wash his garments, and bathe his body in water, and afterwards he shall enter into the camp.
003	LEV	016	029	And this shall be a perpetual statute for you; in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, ye shall humble your souls, and shall do no work, the native and the stranger who abides among you.
003	LEV	016	030	For in this day he shall make an atonement for you, to cleanse you from all your sins before the Lord, and ye shall be purged.
003	LEV	016	031	This shall be to you a most holy sabbath, a rest, and ye shall humble your souls; it is a perpetual ordinance.
003	LEV	016	032	The priest whomsoever they shall anoint shall make atonement, and whomsoever they shall consecrate to exercise the priestly office after his father; and he shall put on the linen robe, the holy garment.
003	LEV	016	033	And he shall make atonement for the most holy place, and the tabernacle of witness; and he shall make atonement for the altar, and for the priests; and he shall make atonement for all the congregation.
003	LEV	016	034	And this shall be to you a perpetual statute to make atonement for the children of Israel for all their sins: it shall be done once in the year, as the Lord commanded Moses.
003	LEV	017	001	And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
003	LEV	017	002	Speak to Aaron and to his sons, and to all the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them, This is the word which the Lord has commanded, saying,
003	LEV	017	003	Every man of the children of Israel, or of the strangers abiding among you, who shall kill a calf, or a sheep, or a goat in the camp, or who shall kill it out of the camp,
003	LEV	017	004	and shall not bring it to the door of the tabernacle of witness, so as to sacrifice it for a whole-burnt-offering or peace-offering to the Lord to be acceptable for a sweet-smelling savour: and whosoever shall slay it without, and shall not bring it to the door of the tabernacle of witness, so as to offer it as a gift to the Lord before the tabernacle of the Lord; blood shall be imputed to that man, he has shed blood; that soul shall be cut off from his people.
003	LEV	017	005	That the children of Israel may offer their sacrifices, all that they shall slay in the fields, and bring them to the Lord unto the doors of the tabernacle of witness to the priest, and they shall sacrifice them as a peace-offering to the Lord.
003	LEV	017	006	And the priest shall pour the blood on the altar round about before the Lord by the doors of the tabernacle of witness, and shall offer the fat for a sweet-smelling savour to the Lord.
003	LEV	017	007	And they shall no longer offer their sacrifices to vain [gods] after which they go a whoring; it shall be a perpetual statute to you for your generations.
003	LEV	017	008	And thou shalt say to them, Whatever man of the children of Israel, or of the sons of the proselytes abiding among you, shall offer a whole-burnt-offering or a sacrifice,
003	LEV	017	009	and shall not bring it to the door of the tabernacle of witness to sacrifice it to the Lord, that man shall be destroyed from among his people.
003	LEV	017	010	And whatever man of the children of Israel, or of the strangers abiding among you, shall eat any blood, I will even set my face against that soul that eats blood, and will destroy it from its people.
003	LEV	017	011	For the life of flesh is its blood, and I have given it to you on the altar to make atonement for your souls; for its blood shall make atonement for the soul.
003	LEV	017	012	Therefore I said to the children of Israel, No soul of you shall eat blood, and the stranger that abides among you shall not eat blood.
003	LEV	017	013	And whatever man of the children of Israel, or of the strangers abiding among you shall take any animal in hunting, beast, or bird, which is eaten, then shall he pour out the blood, and cover it in the dust.
003	LEV	017	014	For the blood of all flesh is its life; and I said to the children of Israel, Ye shall not eat the blood of any flesh, for the life of all flesh is its blood: every one that eats it shall be destroyed.
003	LEV	017	015	And every soul which eats that which has died of itself, or is taken of beasts, either among the natives or among the strangers, shall wash his garments, and bathe himself in water, and shall be unclean until evening: then shall he be clean.
003	LEV	017	016	But if he do not wash his garments, and do not bathe his body in water, then shall he bear his iniquity.
003	LEV	018	001	And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
003	LEV	018	002	Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them, I [am] the Lord your God.
003	LEV	018	003	Ye shall not do according to the devices of Egypt, in which ye dwelt: and according to the devices of the land of Chanaan, into which I bring you, ye shall not do; and ye shall not walk in their ordinances.
003	LEV	018	004	Ye shall observe my judgments, and shall keep my ordinances, and shall walk in them: I [am] the Lord your God.
003	LEV	018	005	So ye shall keep all my ordinances, and all my judgments, and do them; which if a man do, he shall live in them: I [am] the Lord your God.
003	LEV	018	006	No man shall draw nigh to any of his near kindred to uncover their nakedness; I [am] the Lord.
003	LEV	018	007	Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father, or the nakedness of thy mother, for she is thy mother; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.
003	LEV	018	008	Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's wife; it is thy father's nakedness.
003	LEV	018	009	The nakedness of thy sister by thy father or by thy mother, born at home or abroad, their nakedness thou shalt not uncover.
003	LEV	018	010	The nakedness of thy son's daughter, or thy daughter's daughter, their nakedness thou shalt not uncover; because it is thy nakedness.
003	LEV	018	011	Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of the daughter of thy father's wife; she is thy sister by the same father: thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.
003	LEV	018	012	Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's sister, for she is near akin to thy father.
003	LEV	018	013	Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister, for she is near akin to thy mother.
003	LEV	018	014	Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's brother, and thou shalt not go in to his wife; for she is thy relation.
003	LEV	018	015	Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy daughter-in-law, for she is thy son's wife, thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.
003	LEV	018	016	Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brother's wife: it is thy brother's nakedness.
003	LEV	018	017	The nakedness of a woman and her daughter shalt thou not uncover; her son's daughter, and her daughter's daughter, shalt thou not take, to uncover their nakedness, for they are thy kinswomen: it is impiety.
003	LEV	018	018	Thou shalt not take a wife in addition to her sister, as a rival, to uncover her nakedness in opposition to her, while she is yet living.
003	LEV	018	019	And thou shalt not go in to a woman under separation for her uncleanness, to uncover her nakedness.
003	LEV	018	020	And thou shalt not lie with thy neighbour's wife, to defile thyself with her.
003	LEV	018	021	And thou shalt not give of thy seed to serve a ruler; and thou shalt not profane my holy name; I [am] the Lord.
003	LEV	018	022	And thou shalt not lie with a man as with a woman, for it is an abomination.
003	LEV	018	023	Neither shalt thou lie with any quadruped for copulation, to be polluted with it: neither shall a woman present herself before any quadruped to have connexion with it; for it is an abomination.
003	LEV	018	024	Do not defile yourselves with any of these things; for in all these things the nations are defiled, which I drive out before you,
003	LEV	018	025	and the land is polluted; and I have recompensed their iniquity to them because of it, and the land is aggrieved with them that dwell upon it.
003	LEV	018	026	And ye shall keep all my statutes and all my ordinances, and ye shall do none of these abominations; neither the native, nor the stranger that joins himself with you:
003	LEV	018	027	(for all these abominations the men of the land did who were before you, and the land was defiled,)
003	LEV	018	028	and lest the land be aggrieved with you in your polluting it, as it was aggrieved with the nations before you.

003	LEV	022	005	or whosoever shall touch any unclean reptile, which will defile him, or [who shall touch] a man, whereby he shall defile him according to all his uncleanness:
003	LEV	022	006	whatsoever soul shall touch them shall be unclean until evening; he shall not eat of the holy things, unless he bathe his body in water,
003	LEV	022	007	and the sun go down, and then he shall be clean; and then shall he eat of all the holy things, for they are his bread.
003	LEV	022	008	He shall not eat that which dies of itself, or is taken of beasts, so that he should be polluted by them: I [am] the Lord.
003	LEV	022	009	And they shall keep my ordinances, that they do not bear iniquity because of them, and die because of them, if they shall profane them: I [am] the Lord God that sanctifies them.
003	LEV	022	010	And no stranger shall eat the holy things: one that sojourns with a priest, or a hireling, shall not eat the holy things.
003	LEV	022	011	But if a priest should have a soul purchased for money, he shall eat of his bread; and they that are born in his house, they also shall eat of his bread.

003	LEV	022	026	And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
003	LEV	022	027	As for a calf, or a sheep, or a goat, whenever it is born, then shall it be seven days under its mother; and on the eighth day and after they shall be accepted for sacrifices, a burnt-offering to the Lord.
003	LEV	022	028	And a bullock and a ewe, it and its young, thou shalt not kill in one day.

003	LEV	023	037	These [are] the feasts to the Lord, which ye shall call holy convocations, to offer burnt-offerings to the Lord, whole-burnt-offerings and their meat-offerings, and their drink-offerings, that for each day on its day:
003	LEV	023	038	besides the sabbaths of the Lord, and besides your gifts, and besides all your vows, and besides your free-will-offerings, which ye shall give to the Lord.
003	LEV	023	039	And on the fifteenth day of this seventh month, when ye shall have completely gathered in the fruits of the earth, ye shall keep a feast to the Lord seven days; on the first day there shall be a rest, and on the eighth day a rest.
003	LEV	023	040	And on the first day ye shall take goodly fruit of trees, and branches of palm trees, and thick boughs of trees, and willows, and branches of osiers from the brook, to rejoice before the Lord your God seven days in the year.
003	LEV	023	041	[It is] a perpetual statute for your generations: in the seventh month ye shall keep it.
003	LEV	023	042	Seven days ye shall dwell in tabernacles: every native in Israel shall dwell in tents,
003	LEV	023	043	that your posterity may see, that I made the children of Israel to dwell in tents, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I [am] the Lord your God.
003	LEV	023	044	And Moses recounted the feasts of the Lord to the children of Israel.
003	LEV	024	001	And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
003	LEV	024	002	Charge the children of Israel, and let them take for thee pure olive oil beaten for the light, to burn a lamp continually,
003	LEV	024	003	outside the veil in the tabernacle of witness; and Aaron and his sons shall burn it from evening until morning before the Lord continually, a perpetual statute throughout your generations.
003	LEV	024	004	Ye shall burn the lamps on the pure lamp-stand before the Lord till the morrow.
003	LEV	024	005	And ye shall take fine flour, and make of it twelve loaves; each loaf shall be of two tenth parts.
003	LEV	024	006	And ye shall put them [in] two rows, each row [containing] six loaves, on the pure table before the Lord.
003	LEV	024	007	And ye shall put on [each] row pure frankincense and salt; and [these things] shall be for loaves for a memorial, set forth before the Lord.
003	LEV	024	008	On the sabbath-day they shall be set forth before the Lord continually before the children of Israel, for an everlasting covenant.
003	LEV	024	009	And they shall be for Aaron and his sons, and they shall eat them in the holy place: for this is their most holy portion of the offerings made to the Lord, a perpetual statute.
003	LEV	024	010	And there went forth a son of an Israelitish woman, and he was son of an Egyptian man among the sons of Israel; and they fought in the camp, the son of the Israelitish woman, and a man who was an Israelite.
003	LEV	024	011	And the son of the Israelitish woman named THE NAME and curse; and they brought him to Moses: and his mother's name was Salomith, daughter of Dabri of the tribe of Dan.
003	LEV	024	012	And they put him in ward, to judge him by the command of the Lord.
003	LEV	024	013	And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
003	LEV	024	014	Bring forth him that cursed outside the camp, and all who heard shall lay their hands upon his head, and all the congregation shall stone him.
003	LEV	024	015	And speak to the sons of Israel, and thou shalt say to them, Whosoever shall curse God shall bear his sin.
003	LEV	024	016	And he that names the name of the Lord, let him die the death: let all the congregation of Israel stone him with stones; whether he be a stranger or a native, let him die for naming the name of the Lord.
003	LEV	024	017	And whosoever shall smite a man and he die, let him die the death.
003	LEV	024	018	And whosoever shall smite a beast, and it shall die, let him render life for life.
003	LEV	024	019	And whosoever shall inflict a blemish on his neighbour, as he has done to him, so shall it be done to himself in return;
003	LEV	024	020	bruise for bruise, eye for eye, tooth for tooth: as any one may inflict a blemish on a man, so shall it be rendered to him.
003	LEV	024	021	Whosoever shall smite a man, and he shall die, let him die the death.
003	LEV	024	022	There shall be one judgment for the stranger and the native, for I [am] the Lord your God.
003	LEV	024	023	And Moses spoke to the children of Israel, and they brought him that had cursed out of the camp, and stoned him with stones: and the children of Israel did as the Lord commanded Moses.
003	LEV	025	001	And the Lord spoke to Moses in the mount Sina, saying,
003	LEV	025	002	Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them, Whensoever ye shall have entered into the land, which I give to you, then the land shall rest which I give to you, for its sabbaths to the Lord.
003	LEV	025	003	Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shall prune thy vine, and gather in its fruit.
003	LEV	025	004	But in the seventh year [shall be] a sabbath, it shall be a rest to the land, a sabbath to the Lord: thou shalt not sow thy field, and thou shalt not prune thy vine.
003	LEV	025	005	And thou shalt not gather the spontaneous produce of thy field, and thou shalt not gather fully the grapes of thy dedication: it shall be a year of rest to the land.
003	LEV	025	006	And the sabbaths of the land shall be food for thee, and for thy man-servant, and for thy maid-servant, and thy hireling, and the stranger that abides with thee.
003	LEV	025	007	And for thy cattle, and for the wild beats that are in thy land, shall every fruit of it be for food.
003	LEV	025	008	And thou shalt reckon to thyself seven sabbaths of years, seven times seven years; and they shall be to thee seven weeks of years, nine and forty years.
003	LEV	025	009	In the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, ye shall make a proclamation with the sound of a trumpet in all your land; on the day of atonement ye shall make a proclamation with a trumpet in all your land.
003	LEV	025	010	And ye shall sanctify the year, the fiftieth year, and ye shall proclaim a release upon the land to all that inhabit it; it shall be given a year of release, a jubilee for you; and each one shall depart to his possession, and ye shall go each to his family.
003	LEV	025	011	This is a jubilee of release, the year shall be to you the fiftieth year: ye shall not sow, nor reap the produce that comes of itself from the land, neither shall ye gather its dedicated fruits.
003	LEV	025	012	For it is a jubilee of release; it shall be holy to you, ye shall eat its fruits off the fields.
003	LEV	025	013	In the year of the release [even] the jubilee of it, shall [each] one return to his possession.
003	LEV	025	014	And if thou shouldest sell a possession to thy neighbour, or if thou shouldest buy of thy neighbour, let not a man oppress his neighbour.
003	LEV	025	015	According to the number of years after the jubilee shalt thou buy of thy neighbour, according to the number of years of the fruits shall he sell to thee.
003	LEV	025	016	According as [there may be] a greater number of years he shall increase [the value of] his possession, and according as [there may be] a less number of years he shall lessen [the value of] his possession; for according to the number of his crops, so shall he sell to thee.
003	LEV	025	017	Let not a man oppress his neighbour, and thou shalt fear the Lord thy God: I am the Lord thy God.
003	LEV	025	018	And ye shall keep all my ordinances, and all my judgments; and do ye observe them, and ye shall keep them, and dwell securely in the land.
003	LEV	025	019	And the land shall yield her increase, and ye shall eat to fullness, and shall dwell securely in it.
003	LEV	025	020	And if ye should say, What shall we eat in this seventh year, if we do not sow nor gather in our fruits?
003	LEV	025	021	Then will I send my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and the land shall produce its fruits for three years.
003	LEV	025	022	And ye shall sow in the eighth year, and eat old fruits till the ninth year: until its fruit come, ye shall eat old fruits of the old.
003	LEV	025	023	And the land shall not be sold for a permanence; for the land is mine, because ye are strangers and sojourners before me.
003	LEV	025	024	And in every land of your possession, ye shall allow ransoms for the land.
003	LEV	025	025	And if thy brother who is with thee be poor, and should have sold [part] of his possession, and his kinsman who is nigh to him come, then he shall redeem the possession which his brother has sold.
003	LEV	025	026	And if one have no near kinsman, and he prosper with his hand, and he find sufficient money, [even] his ransom;
003	LEV	025	027	then shall he calculate the years of his sale, and he shall give what is due to the man to whom he sold it, and he shall return to his possession.
003	LEV	025	028	But if his hand have not prospered sufficiently, so as that he should restore the money to him, then he that bought the possessions shall have them till the sixth year of the release; and it shall go out in the release, and the owner shall return to his possession.
003	LEV	025	029	And if any one should sell an inhabited house in a walled city, then there shall be the ransom of it, until [the time] is fulfilled: its time of ransom shall be a full year.
003	LEV	025	030	And if it be not ransomed until there be completed of its time a full year, the house which is in the walled city shall be surely confirmed to him that bought it, throughout his generations; and it shall not go out in the release.
003	LEV	025	031	But the houses in the villages which have not a wall round about them, shall be reckoned as the fields of the country: they shall always be redeemable, and they shall go out in the release.
003	LEV	025	032	And the cities of the Levites, the houses of the cities in their possession, shall be always redeemable to the Levites.
003	LEV	025	033	And if any one shall redeem a house of the Levites, then shall their sale of the houses of their possession go out in the release; because the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession in the midst of the children of Israel.
003	LEV	025	034	And the lands set apart for their cities shall not be sold, because this is their perpetual possession.
003	LEV	025	035	And if thy brother who is with thee become poor, and he fail in resources with thee, thou shalt help him as a stranger and a sojourner, and thy brother shall live with thee.
003	LEV	025	036	Thou shalt not receive from him interest, nor increase: and thou shalt fear thy God: I [am] the Lord: and thy brother shall live with thee.
003	LEV	025	037	Thou shalt not lend thy money to him at interest, and thou shalt not lend thy meat to him to be returned with increase.
003	LEV	025	038	I [am] the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Chanaan, so as to be your God.
003	LEV	025	039	And if thy brother by thee be lowered, and be sold to thee, he shall not serve thee with the servitude of a slave.
003	LEV	025	040	He shall be with thee as a hireling or a sojourner, he shall work for thee till the year of release:
003	LEV	025	041	and he shall go out in the release, and his children with him; and he shall go to his family, he shall hasten back to his patrimony.
003	LEV	025	042	Because these are my servants, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt; such an one shall not be sold as a [common] servant.
003	LEV	025	043	Thou shalt not oppress him with labour, and shalt fear the Lord thy God.
003	LEV	025	044	And whatever number of men-servants and maid-servants thou shalt have, thou shalt purchase male and female servants from the nations that are round about thee.
003	LEV	025	045	And of the sons of the sojourners that are among you, of these ye shall buy and of their relations, all that shall be in your lands; let them be to you for a possession.
003	LEV	025	046	And ye shall distribute them to your children after you, and they shall be to you permanent possessions for ever: but of your brethren the children of Israel, one shall not oppress his brother in labours.
003	LEV	025	047	And if a stranger or sojourner with thee wax rich, and thy brother in distress be sold to the stranger or the sojourner that is with thee, or to a proselyte by extraction;
003	LEV	025	048	after he is sold to him there shall be redemption for him, one of his brethren shall redeem him.
003	LEV	025	049	A brother of his father, or a son of his father's brother shall redeem him; or let one of his near kin of his tribe redeem him, and if he should be rich and redeem himself,
003	LEV	025	050	then shall he calculate with his purchaser from the year that he sold himself to him until the year of release: and the money of his purchase shall be as that of a hireling, he shall be with him from year to year.
003	LEV	025	051	And if any have a greater number of years [than enough], according to these he shall pay his ransom out of his purchase-money.
003	LEV	025	052	And if but a little time be left of the years to the year of release, then shall he reckon to him according to his years, and shall pay his ransom
003	LEV	025	053	as a hireling; he shall be with him from year to year; thou shalt not oppress him with labour before thee.
003	LEV	025	054	And if he do not pay his ransom accordingly, he shall go out in the year of his release, he and his children with him.
003	LEV	025	055	For the children of Israel are my servants: they are my attendants, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt.
003	LEV	026	001	I [am] the Lord your God: ye shall not make to yourselves gods made with hands, or graven; neither shall ye rear up a pillar for yourselves, neither shall ye set up a stone [for] an object in your land to worship it: I am the Lord your God.
003	LEV	026	002	Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuaries: I am the Lord.
003	LEV	026	003	If ye will walk in my ordinances, and keep my commandments, and do them,
003	LEV	026	004	then will I give you the rain in its season, and the land shall produce its fruits, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit.
003	LEV	026	005	And your threshing time shall overtake the vintage, and your vintage shall overtake your seed time; and ye shall eat your bread to the full; and ye shall dwell safely upon your land, and war shall not go through your land.
003	LEV	026	006	And I will give peace in your land, and ye shall sleep, and none [shall] make you afraid; and I will destroy the evil beasts out of your land,
003	LEV	026	007	and ye shall pursue your enemies, and they shall fall before you with slaughter.
003	LEV	026	008	And five of you shall chase a hundred, and a hundred of you shall chase tens of thousands; and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.
003	LEV	026	009	And I will look upon you, and increase you, and multiply you, and establish my covenant with you.
003	LEV	026	010	And ye shall eat that which is old and very old, and bring forth the old to make way for the new.
003	LEV	026	011	And I will set my tabernacle among you, and my soul shall not abhor you;
003	LEV	026	012	and I will walk among you, and be your God, and ye shall be my people.
003	LEV	026	013	I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, where ye were slaves; and I broke the band of your yoke, and brought you forth openly.
003	LEV	026	014	But if ye will not hearken to me, nor obey these my ordinances,
003	LEV	026	015	but disobey them, and your soul should loathe my judgments, so that ye should not keep all my commands, so as to break my covenant,
003	LEV	026	016	then will I do thus to you: I will even bring upon you perplexity and the itch, and the fever that causes your eyes to waste away, and [disease] that consumes your life; and ye shall sow your seeds in vain, and your enemies shall eat them.
003	LEV	026	017	And I will set my face against you, and ye shall fall before your enemies, and they that hate you shall pursue you; and ye shall flee, no one pursuing you.
003	LEV	026	018	And if ye still refuse to hearken to me, then will I chasten you yet more even seven times for your sins.
003	LEV	026	019	And I will break down the haughtiness of your pride; and I will make your heaven iron, and your earth as it were brass.
003	LEV	026	020	And your strength shall be in vain; and your land shall not yield its seed, and the tree of your field shall not yield its fruit.
003	LEV	026	021	And if after this ye should walk perversely, and not be willing to obey me, I will further bring upon you seven plagues according to your sins.
003	LEV	026	022	And I will send upon you the wild beasts of the land, and they shall devour you, and shall consume your cattle: and I will make you few in number, and your ways shall be desolate.
003	LEV	026	023	And if hereupon ye are not corrected, but walk perversely towards me,
003	LEV	026	024	I also will walk with you with a perverse spirit, and I also will smite you seven times for your sins.
003	LEV	026	025	And I will bring upon you a sword avenging the cause of [my] covenant, and ye shall flee for refuge to your cities; and I will send out death against you, and ye shall be delivered into the hands of your enemies.
003	LEV	026	026	When I afflict you with famine of bread, then ten women shall bake your loaves in one oven, and they shall render your loaves by weight; and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied.
003	LEV	026	027	And if hereupon ye will not obey me, but walk perversely towards me,
003	LEV	026	028	then will I walk with you with a froward mind, and I will chasten you seven-fold according to your sins.
003	LEV	026	029	And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat.
003	LEV	026	030	And I will render your pillars desolate, and will utterly destroy your wooden [images] made with hands; and I will lay your carcases on the carcases of your idols, and my soul shall loathe you.
003	LEV	026	031	And I will lay your cities waste, and I will make your sanctuaries desolate, and I will not smell the savour of your sacrifices.
003	LEV	026	032	And I will lay your land desolate, and your enemies who dwell in it shall wonder at it.
003	LEV	026	033	And I will scatter you among the nations, and the sword shall come upon you and consume you; and your land shall be desolate, and your cities shall be desolate.
003	LEV	026	034	Then the land shall enjoy its sabbaths all the days of its desolation.
003	LEV	026	035	And ye shall be in the land of your enemies; then the land shall keep its sabbaths, and the land shall enjoy its sabbaths all the days of its desolation: it shall keep sabbaths which it kept not among your sabbaths, when ye dwelt in it.
003	LEV	026	036	And to those who are left of you I will bring bondage into their heart in the land of their enemies; and the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them, and they shall flee as fleeing from war, and shall fall when none pursues them.
003	LEV	026	037	And brother shall disregard brother as in war, when none pursues; and ye shall not be able to withstand your enemies.
003	LEV	026	038	And ye shall perish among the Gentiles, and the land of your enemies shall devour you.
003	LEV	026	039	And those who are left of you shall perish, because of their sins, and because of the sins of their fathers: in the land of their enemies shall they consume away.
003	LEV	026	040	And they shall confess their sins, and the sins of their fathers, that they have transgressed and neglected me, and that they have walked perversely before me,
003	LEV	026	041	and I walked with them with a perverse mind; and I will destroy them in the land of their enemies: then shall their uncircumcised heart be ashamed, and then shall they acquiesce in [the punishment of] their sins.
003	LEV	026	042	And I will remember the covenant of Jacob, and the covenant of Isaac, and the covenant of Abraam will I remember.
003	LEV	026	043	And I will remember the land, and the land shall be left of them; then the land shall enjoy her sabbaths, when it is deserted through them: and they shall accept [the punishment of] their iniquities, because they neglected my judgments, and in their soul loathed my ordinances.
003	LEV	026	044	And yet not even thus, while they were in the land of their enemies, did I overlook them, nor did I loathe them so as to consume them, to break my covenant made with them; for I am the Lord their God.
003	LEV	026	045	And I will remember their former covenant, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage before the nation, to be their God; I am the Lord.
003	LEV	026	046	These are my judgments and my ordinances, and the law which the Lord gave between himself and the children of Israel, in the mount Sina, by the hand of Moses.
003	LEV	027	001	And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
003	LEV	027	002	Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them, Whosoever shall vow a vow as the valuation of his soul for the Lord,
003	LEV	027	003	the valuation of a male from twenty years old to sixty years old shall be his valuation shall be fifty didrachms of silver by the standard of the sanctuary.
003	LEV	027	004	And the valuation of a female shall be thirty didrachms.
003	LEV	027	005	And if it be from five years old to twenty, the valuation of a male shall be twenty didrachms, and of a female ten didrachms.
003	LEV	027	006	And from a month old to five years old, the valuation of a male shall be five didrachms, and of a female, three didrachms of silver.
003	LEV	027	007	And if from sixty year [old] and upward, if it be a male, his valuation shall be fifteen didrachms of silver, and if a female, ten didrachms.
003	LEV	027	008	And if the man be too poor for the valuation, he shall stand before the priest; and the priest shall value him: according to what the man who has vowed can afford, the priest shall value him.
003	LEV	027	009	And if it be from the cattle that are offered as a gift to the Lord, whoever shall offer one of these to the Lord, it shall be holy.
003	LEV	027	010	He shall not change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good; and if he do at all change it, a beast for a beast, it and the substitute shall be holy.
003	LEV	027	011	And if it be any unclean beast, of which none are offered as a gift to the Lord, he shall set the beast before the priest.
003	LEV	027	012	And the priest shall make a valuation between the good and the bad, and accordingly as the priest shall value it, so shall it stand.
003	LEV	027	013	And if [the worshipper] will at all redeem it, he shall add the fifth part to its value.
003	LEV	027	014	And whatsoever man shall consecrate his house as holy to the Lord, the priest shall make a valuation of it between the good and the bad: as the priest shall value it, so shall it stand.
003	LEV	027	015	And if he that has sanctified it should redeem his house, he shall add to it the fifth part of the money of the valuation, and it shall be his.
003	LEV	027	016	And if a man should hallow to the Lord a part of the field of his possession, then the valuation shall be according to its seed, fifty didrachms of silver for a homer of barley.
003	LEV	027	017	And if he should sanctify his field from the year of release, it shall stand according to his valuation.
003	LEV	027	018	And if he should sanctify his field in the latter time after the release, the priest shall reckon to him the money for the remaining years, until the [next] year of release, and it shall be deducted as an equivalent from his full valuation.
003	LEV	027	019	And if he that sanctified the field would redeem it, he shall add to its value the fifth part of the money, and it shall be his.
003	LEV	027	020	And if he do not redeem the field, but should sell the field to another man, he shall not after redeem it.
003	LEV	027	021	But the field shall be holy to the Lord after the release, as separated land; the priest shall have possession of it.
003	LEV	027	022	And if he should consecrate to the Lord of a field which he has bought, which is not of the field of his possession,
003	LEV	027	023	the priest shall reckon to him the full valuation from the year of release, and he shall pay the valuation in that day [as] holy to the Lord.
003	LEV	027	024	And in the year of release the land shall be restored to the man of whom the other bought it, whose the possession of the land was.
003	LEV	027	025	And every valuation shall be by holy weights: the didrachm shall be twenty oboli.
003	LEV	027	026	And every first-born which shall be produced among thy cattle shall be the Lord's, and no man shall sanctify it: whether calf or sheep, it is the Lord's.
003	LEV	027	027	But if he should redeem an unclean beast, according to its valuation, then he shall add the fifth part to it, and it shall be his; and if he redeem it not, it shall be sold according to its valuation.
003	LEV	027	028	And every dedicated thing which a man shall dedicate to the Lord of all that he has, whether man or beast, or of the field of his possession, he shall not sell it, nor redeem it: every devoted thing shall be most holy to the Lord.
003	LEV	027	029	And whatever shall be dedicated of men, shall not be ransomed, but shall be surely put to death.
003	LEV	027	030	Every tithe of the land, both of the seed of the land, and of the fruit of trees, is the Lord's, holy to the Lord.
003	LEV	027	031	And if a man should at all redeem his tithe, he shall add the fifth part to it, and it shall be his.
003	LEV	027	032	And every tithe of oxen, and of sheep, and whatsoever may come in numbering under the rod, the tenth shall be holy to the Lord.
003	LEV	027	033	Thou shalt not change a good for a bad, or a bad for a good; and if thou shouldest at all change it, its equivalent also shall be holy, it shall not be redeemed.
003	LEV	027	034	These are the commandments which the Lord commanded Moses for the sons of Israel in mount Sina.

004	NUM	007	089	When Moses went into the tabernacle of witness to speak to God, then he heard the voice of the Lord speaking to him from off the mercy-seat, which is upon the ark of the testimony, between the two cherubs; and he spoke to him.

004	NUM	008	002	Speak to Aaron, and thou shalt say to him, Whenever thou shalt set the lamps in order, the seven lamps shall give light opposite the candlestick.
004	NUM	008	003	And Aaron did so: on one side opposite the candlestick he lighted its lamps, as the Lord appointed Moses.
004	NUM	008	004	And this [is] the construction of the candlestick: [it is] solid, golden—its stem, and its lilies—all solid: according to the pattern which the Lord shewed Moses, so he made the candlestick.
004	NUM	008	005	And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
004	NUM	008	006	Take the Levites out of the midst of the children of Israel, and thou shalt purify them.
004	NUM	008	007	And thus shalt thou perform their purification: thou shalt sprinkle them with water of purification, and a razor shall come upon the whole of their body, and they shall wash their garments, and shall be clean.
004	NUM	008	008	And they shall take one calf of the herd, and its meat-offering, fine flour mingled with oil: and thou shalt take a calf of a year old of the herd for a sin-offering.
004	NUM	008	009	And thou shalt bring the Levites before the tabernacle of witness; and thou shalt assemble all the congregation of the sons of Israel.
004	NUM	008	010	And thou shalt bring the Levites before the Lord; and the sons of Israel shall lay their hands upon the Levites.

004	NUM	008	012	And the Levites shall lay their hands on the heads of the calves; and thou shalt offer one for a sin-offering, and the other for a whole-burnt-offering to the Lord, to make atonement for them.

004	NUM	008	016	For these are given to me for a present out of the midst of the children of Israel: I have taken them to myself instead of all the first-born of the sons of Israel that open every womb.
004	NUM	008	017	For every first-born among the children of Israel [is] mine, whether of man or beast: in the day in which I smote every first-born in the land of Egypt, I sanctified them to myself.
004	NUM	008	018	And I took the Levites in the place of every first-born among the children of Israel.
004	NUM	008	019	And I gave the Levites presented as a gift to Aaron and his sons out of the midst of the children of Israel, to do the service of the children of Israel in the tabernacle of witness, and to make atonement for the children of Israel: thus there shall be none among the sons of Israel to draw nigh to the holy things.
004	NUM	008	020	And Moses and Aaron, and all the congregation of the children of Israel, did to the Levites as the Lord commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so the sons of Israel did to them.
004	NUM	008	021	So the Levites purified themselves and washed their garments; and Aaron presented them as a gift before the Lord, and Aaron made atonement for them to purify them.
004	NUM	008	022	And afterwards the Levites went in to minister in their service in the tabernacle of witness before Aaron, and before his sons; as the Lord appointed Moses concerning the Levites, so they did to them.

004	NUM	009	006	And there came men who were unclean by reason of a dead body, and they were not able to keep the passover on that day; and they came before Moses and Aaron on that day.
004	NUM	009	007	And those men said to Moses, We are unclean by reason of the dead body of a man: shall we therefore fail to offer the gift to the Lord in its season in the midst of the children of Israel?
004	NUM	009	008	And Moses said to them, stand there, and I will hear what charge the Lord will give concerning you.
004	NUM	009	009	And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
004	NUM	009	010	Speak to the children of Israel, saying, Whatever man shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or on a journey far off, among you, or among your posterity; he shall then keep the passover to the Lord,
004	NUM	009	011	in the second month, on the fourteenth day; in the evening they shall offer it, with unleavened bread and bitter herbs shall they eat it.
004	NUM	009	012	They shall not leave of it until the morrow, and they shall not break a bone of it; they shall sacrifice it according to the ordinance of the passover.
004	NUM	009	013	And whatsoever man shall be clean, and is not far off on a journey, and shall fail to keep the passover, that soul shall be cut off from his people, because he has not offered the gift to the Lord in its season: that man shall bear his iniquity.
004	NUM	009	014	And if there should come to you a stranger in your land, and should keep the passover to the Lord, he shall keep it according to the law of the passover and according to its ordinance: there shall be one law for you, both for the stranger, and for the native of the land.
004	NUM	009	015	And in the day in which the tabernacle was pitched the cloud covered the tabernacle, the place of the testimony; and in the evening there was upon the tabernacle as the appearance of fire till the morning.
004	NUM	009	016	So it was continually: the cloud covered it by day, and the appearance of fire by night.
004	NUM	009	017	And when the cloud went up from the tabernacle, then after that the children of Israel departed; and in whatever place the cloud rested, there the children of Israel encamped.
004	NUM	009	018	The children of Israel shall encamp by the command of the Lord, and by the command of the Lord they shall remove: all the days in which the cloud overshadows the tabernacle, the children of Israel shall encamp. And whenever the cloud shall be drawn over the tabernacle for many days, then the children of Israel shall keep the charge of God, and they shall not remove.
004	NUM	009	019	And it shall be, whenever the cloud overshadows the tabernacle a number of days, they shall encamp by the word of the Lord, and shall remove by the command of the Lord.

004	NUM	009	021	When the cloud continues a full month overshadowing the tabernacle, the children of Israel shall encamp, and shall not depart.

004	NUM	010	002	Make to thyself two silver trumpets: thou shalt make them of beaten work; and they shall be to thee for the purpose of calling the assembly, and of removing the camps.

004	NUM	010	008	And the priests the sons of Aaron shall sound with the trumpets; and it shall be a perpetual ordinance for you throughout your generations.
004	NUM	010	009	And if ye shall go forth to war in your land against your enemies that are opposed to you, then shall ye sound with the trumpets; and ye shall be had in remembrance before the Lord, and ye shall be saved from your enemies.
004	NUM	010	010	And in the days of your gladness, and in your feasts, and in your new moons, ye shall sound with the trumpets at your whole-burnt-offerings, and at the sacrifices of your peace-offerings; and there shall be a memorial for you before your God: I [am] the Lord your God.
004	NUM	010	011	And it came to pass in the second year, in the second month, on the twentieth day of the month, the cloud went up from the tabernacle of witness.

004	NUM	011	021	And Moses said, The people among whom I am are six hundred thousand footmen; and thou saidst, I will give them flesh to eat, and they shall eat a whole month.
004	NUM	011	022	Shall sheep and oxen be slain for them, and shall it suffice them? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, and shall it suffice them?
004	NUM	011	023	And the Lord said to Moses, Shall not the hand of the Lord be fully sufficient? now shalt thou know whether my word shall come to pass to thee or not.
004	NUM	011	024	And Moses went out, and spoke the words of the Lord to the people; and he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people, and he set them round about the tabernacle.
004	NUM	011	025	And the Lord came down in a cloud, and spoke to him, and took of the spirit that was upon him, and put it upon the seventy men that were elders; and when the spirit rested upon them, they prophesied and ceased.

004	NUM	011	032	And the people rose up all the day, and all the night, and all the next day, and gathered quails; he that gathered least, gathered ten measures; and they refreshed themselves round about the camp.
004	NUM	011	033	The flesh was yet between their teeth, before it failed, when the Lord was wroth with the people, and the Lord smote the people with a very great plague.

004	NUM	013	028	Only the nation that dwells upon it is bold, and they have very great and strong walled towns, and we saw there the children of Enach.
004	NUM	013	029	And Amalec dwells in the land toward the south: and the Chettite and the Evite, and the Jebusite, and the Amorite dwells in the hill country: and the Chananite dwells by the sea, and by the river Jordan.
004	NUM	013	030	And Chaleb stayed the people from speaking before Moses, and said to him, Nay, but we will go up by all means, and will inherit it, for we shall surely prevail against them.
004	NUM	013	031	But the men that went up together with him said, We will not go up, for we shall not by any means be able to go up against the nation, for it is much stronger than we.
004	NUM	013	032	And they brought a horror of that land which they surveyed upon the children of Israel, saying, The land which we passed by to survey it, is a land that eats up its inhabitants; and all the people whom we saw in it are men of extraordinary stature.
004	NUM	013	033	And there we saw the giants; and we were before them as locusts, yea even so were we before them.
004	NUM	014	001	And all the congregation lifted up their voice and cried; and the people wept all that night.
004	NUM	014	002	And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron; and all the congregation said to them,
004	NUM	014	003	Would we had died in the land of Egypt! or in this wilderness, would we had died! and why does the Lord bring us into this land to fall in war? our wives and our children shall be for a prey: now then it is better to return into Egypt.
004	NUM	014	004	And they said one to another, Let us make a ruler, and return into Egypt.
004	NUM	014	005	And Moses and Aaron fell upon their face before all the congregation of the children of Israel.
004	NUM	014	006	But Joshua the [son] of Naue, and Chaleb the [son] of Jephonne, of [the number of] them that spied out the land, rent their garments,
004	NUM	014	007	and spoke to all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, The land which we surveyed is indeed extremely good.
004	NUM	014	008	If the Lord choose us, he will bring us into this land, and give it us; a land which flows with milk and honey.
004	NUM	014	009	Only depart not from the Lord; and fear ye not the people of the land, for they are meat for us; for the season [of prosperity] is departed from them, but the Lord [is] among us: fear them not.
004	NUM	014	010	And all the congregation bade stone them with stones; and the glory of the Lord appeared in the cloud on the tabernacle of witness to all the children of Israel.
004	NUM	014	011	And the Lord said to Moses, How long does this people provoke me? and how long do they refuse to believe me for all the signs which I have wrought among them?
004	NUM	014	012	I will smite them with death, and destroy them; and I will make of thee and of thy father's house a great nation, and much greater than this.
004	NUM	014	013	And Moses said to the Lord, So Egypt shall hear, for thou hast brought up this people from them by thy might.
004	NUM	014	014	Moreover all the dwellers upon this land have heard that thou art Lord in the midst of this people, who, O Lord, art seen [by them] face to face, and thy cloud rests upon them, and thou goest before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, and by night in a pillar of fire.
004	NUM	014	015	And [if] thou shalt destroy this nation as one man; then all the nations that have heard thy name shall speak, saying,
004	NUM	014	016	Because the Lord could not bring this people into the land which he sware to them, he has overthrown them in the wilderness.
004	NUM	014	017	And now, O Lord, let thy strength be exalted, as thou spakest, saying,
004	NUM	014	018	The Lord [is] long-suffering and merciful, and true, removing transgressions and iniquities and sins, and he will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the sins of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generation.
004	NUM	014	019	Forgive this people their sin according to thy great mercy, as thou wast favourable to them from Egypt until now.
004	NUM	014	020	And the Lord said to Moses, I am gracious to them according to thy word.
004	NUM	014	021	But [as] I live and my name is living, so the glory of the Lord shall fill all the earth.
004	NUM	014	022	For all the men who see my glory, and the signs which I wrought in Egypt, and in the wilderness, and have tempted me this tenth time, and have not hearkened to my voice,
004	NUM	014	023	surely they shall not see the land, which I sware to their fathers; but their children which are with me here, as many as know not good or evil, every inexperienced youth, to them will I give the land; but none who have provoked me shall see it.
004	NUM	014	024	But my servant Chaleb, because there was another spirit in him, and he followed me, I will bring him into the land into which he entered, and his seed shall inherit it.
004	NUM	014	025	But Amalec and the Chananite dwell in the valley: to-morrow turn and depart for the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea.
004	NUM	014	026	And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,
004	NUM	014	027	How long [shall I endure] this wicked congregation? I have heard their murmurings against me, [even] the murmuring of the children of Israel, which they have murmured concerning you.
004	NUM	014	028	Say to them, [As] I live, saith the Lord: surely as ye spoke into my ears, so will I do to you.
004	NUM	014	029	Your carcases shall fall in this wilderness; and all those of you that were reviewed, and those of you that were numbered from twenty years old and upward, all that murmured against me,
004	NUM	014	030	ye shall not enter into the land for which I stretched out my hand to establish you upon it; except only Chaleb the son of Jephonne, and Joshua the [son] of Naue.
004	NUM	014	031	And your little ones, who ye said should be a prey, them will I bring into the land; and they shall inherit the land, which ye rejected.
004	NUM	014	032	And your carcases shall fall in this wilderness.
004	NUM	014	033	And your sons shall be fed in the wilderness forty years, and they shall bear your fornication, until your carcases be consumed in the wilderness.
004	NUM	014	034	According to the number of the days during which ye spied the land, forty days, a day for a year, ye shall bear your sins forty years, and ye shall know my fierce anger.
004	NUM	014	035	I the Lord have spoken, Surely will I do thus to this evil congregation that has risen up together against me: in this wilderness they shall be utterly consumed, and there they shall die.
004	NUM	014	036	And the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land, and who came and murmured against it to the assembly so as to bring out evil words concerning the land, —
004	NUM	014	037	the men that spoke evil reports against the land, even died of the plague before the Lord.
004	NUM	014	038	And Joshua the son of Naue and Chaleb the son of Jephonne [still] lived of those men that went to spy out the land.
004	NUM	014	039	And Moses spoke these words to all the children of Israel; and the people mourned exceedingly.
004	NUM	014	040	And they rose early in the morning and went up to the top of the mountain, saying, Behold, we that are here will go up to the place of which the Lord has spoken, because we have sinned.
004	NUM	014	041	And Moses said, Why do ye transgress the word of the Lord? ye shall not prosper.
004	NUM	014	042	Go not up, for the Lord is not with you; so shall ye fall before the face of your enemies.
004	NUM	014	043	For Amalec and the Chananite [are] there before you, and ye shall fall by the sword; because ye have disobeyed the Lord and turned aside, and the Lord will not be among you.
004	NUM	014	044	And having forced their passage, they went up to the top of the mountain; but the ark of the covenant of the Lord and Moses stirred not out of the camp.
004	NUM	014	045	And Amalec and the Chananite that dwelt in that mountain came down, and routed them, and destroyed them unto Herman; and they returned to the camp.
004	NUM	015	001	And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
004	NUM	015	002	Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them, When ye are come into the land of your habitation, which I give to you,
004	NUM	015	003	and thou wilt offer whole-burnt-offerings to the Lord, a whole-burnt-offering or a meat-offering to perform a vow, or a free-will offering, or to offer in your feasts a sacrifice of sweet savour to the Lord, whether of the herd or the flock:
004	NUM	015	004	then he that offers his gift to the Lord shall bring a meat-offering of fine flour, a tenth part of an ephah mingled with oil, even with the fourth part of a hin.
004	NUM	015	005	And for a drink-offering ye shall offer the fourth part of a hin on the whole-burnt-offering, or on the meat-offering: for every lamb thou shalt offer so much, as a sacrifice, a smell of sweet savour to the Lord.
004	NUM	015	006	And for a ram, when ye offer it as a whole-burnt-offering or as a sacrifice, thou shalt prepare as a meat-offering two tenths of fine flour mingled with oil, the third part of a hin.
004	NUM	015	007	And ye shall offer for a smell of sweet savour to the Lord wine for a drink-offering, the third part of a hin.
004	NUM	015	008	And if ye sacrifice [a bullock] from the herd for a whole-burnt-offering or for a sacrifice, to perform a vow or a peace-offering to the Lord,
004	NUM	015	009	then [the worshipper] shall offer upon the calf a meat-offering, three tenth deals of fine flour mingled with oil, [even] the half of a hin.
004	NUM	015	010	And wine for a drink-offering the half of a hin, a sacrifice for a smell of sweet savour to the Lord.
004	NUM	015	011	Thus shalt thou do to one calf or to one ram, or to one lamb of the sheep or kid of the goats.
004	NUM	015	012	According to the number of what ye shall offer, so shall ye do to each one, according to their number.
004	NUM	015	013	Every native of the country shall do thus to offer such things as sacrifices for a smell of sweet savour to the Lord.
004	NUM	015	014	And if there should be a stranger among you in your land, or one who should be born to you among your generations, and he will offer a sacrifice, a smell of sweet savour to the Lord—as ye do, so the [whole] congregation shall offer to the Lord.
004	NUM	015	015	There shall be one law for you and for the strangers abiding among you, a perpetual law for your generations: as ye [are], so shall the stranger be before the Lord.
004	NUM	015	016	There shall be one law and one ordinance for you, and for the stranger that abides among you.
004	NUM	015	017	And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
004	NUM	015	018	Speak to the sons of Israel, and thou shalt say to them, When ye are entering into the land, into which I bring you,
004	NUM	015	019	then it shall come to pass, when ye shall eat of the bread of the land, ye shall separate a wave-offering, a special offering to the Lord, the first-fruits of your dough.
004	NUM	015	020	Ye shall offer your bread a heave-offering: as a heave-offering from the threshing-floor, so shall ye separate it,
004	NUM	015	021	even the first-fruits of your dough, and ye shall give the Lord a heave-offering throughout your generations.
004	NUM	015	022	But whensoever ye shall transgress, and not perform all these commands, which the Lord spoke to Moses;
004	NUM	015	023	as the Lord appointed you by the hand of Moses, from the day which the Lord appointed you and forward throughout your generations,
004	NUM	015	024	then it shall come to pass, if a trespass be committed unwillingly, unknown to the congregation, then shall all the congregation offer a calf of the herd without blemish for a whole-burnt-offering of sweet savour to the Lord, and its meat-offering and its drink-offering according to the ordinance, and one kid of the goats for a sin-offering.
004	NUM	015	025	And the priest shall make atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel, and [the trespass] shall be forgiven them, because it is involuntary; and they have brought their gift, a burnt-offering to the Lord for their trespass before the Lord, even for their involuntary sins.
004	NUM	015	026	And it shall be forgiven as respects all the congregation of the children of Israel, and the stranger that is abiding among you, because [it is] involuntary to all the people.
004	NUM	015	027	And if one soul sin unwillingly, he shall bring one she-goat of a year old for a sin-offering.
004	NUM	015	028	And the priest shall make atonement for the soul that committed the trespass unwillingly, and that sinned unwillingly before the Lord, to make atonement for him.
004	NUM	015	029	There shall be one law for the native among the children of Israel, and for the stranger that abides among them, whosoever shall commit a trespass unwillingly.
004	NUM	015	030	And whatever soul either of the natives or of the strangers shall do any thing with a presumptuous hand, he will provoke God; that soul shall be cut off from his people,
004	NUM	015	031	for he has set at nought the word of the Lord and broken his commands: that soul shall be utterly destroyed, his sin [is] upon him.
004	NUM	015	032	And the children of Israel were in the wilderness, and they found a man gathering sticks on the sabbath-day.
004	NUM	015	033	And they who found him gathering sticks on the sabbath-day brought him to Moses and Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel.
004	NUM	015	034	And they placed him in custody, for they did not determine what they should do to him.
004	NUM	015	035	And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, Let the man be by all means put to death: [do ye] all the congregation, stone him with stones.
004	NUM	015	036	And all the congregation brought him forth out of the camp; and all the congregation stoned him with stones outside the camp, as the Lord commanded Moses.
004	NUM	015	037	And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
004	NUM	015	038	Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt tell them; and let them make for themselves fringes upon the borders of their garments throughout their generations: and ye shall put upon the fringes of the borders a lace of blue.
004	NUM	015	039	And it shall be on your fringes, and ye shall look on them, and ye shall remember all the commands of the Lord, and do them: and ye shall not turn back after your imaginations, and after [the sight of your] eyes in the things after which ye go a whoring;
004	NUM	015	040	that ye may remember and perform all my commands, and ye shall be holy unto your God.
004	NUM	015	041	I [am] the Lord your God that brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I [am] the Lord your God.
004	NUM	016	001	And Core the son of Isaar the son of Caath the son of Levi, and Dathan and Abiron, sons of Eliab, and Aun the son of Phaleth the son of Ruben, spoke;
004	NUM	016	002	and rose up before Moses, and two hundred and fifty men of the sons of Israel, chiefs of the assembly, chosen councillors, and men of renown.
004	NUM	016	003	They rose up against Moses and Aaron, and said, Let it be enough for you that all the congregation [are] holy, and the Lord [is] among them; and why do ye set up yourselves against the congregation of the Lord?
004	NUM	016	004	And when Moses heard it, he fell on his face.
004	NUM	016	005	And he spoke to Core and all his assembly, saying, God has visited and known those that are his and who are holy, and has brought them to himself; and whom he has chosen for himself, he has brought to himself.
004	NUM	016	006	This do ye: take to yourselves censers, Core and all his company;
004	NUM	016	007	and put fire on them, and put incense on them before the Lord to-morrow; and it shall come to pass that the man whom the Lord has chosen, he shall be holy: let it be enough for you, ye sons of Levi.
004	NUM	016	008	And Moses said to Core, Hearken to me, ye sons of Levi.
004	NUM	016	009	Is it a little thing for you, that the God of Israel has separated you from the congregation of Israel, and brought you near to himself to minister in the services of the tabernacle of the Lord, and to stand before the tabernacle to minister for them?
004	NUM	016	010	And he has brought thee near and all thy brethren the sons of Levi with thee, and do ye seek to be priests also?
004	NUM	016	011	Thus [it is with] thee and all thy congregation which is gathered together against God: and who is Aaron, that ye murmur against him?
004	NUM	016	012	And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiron sons of Eliab; and they said, We will not go up.
004	NUM	016	013	Is it a little thing that thou hast brought us up to a land flowing with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, [and] that thou altogether rulest over us?
004	NUM	016	014	Thou art a prince, and hast thou brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, and hast thou given us an inheritance of land and vineyards? wouldest thou have put out the eyes of those men? we will not go up.
004	NUM	016	015	And Moses was exceeding indignant, and said to the Lord, Do thou take no heed to their sacrifice: I have not taken away the desire of any one of them, neither have I hurt any one of them.
004	NUM	016	016	And Moses said to Core, Sanctify thy company, and be ready before the Lord, thou and Aaron and they, to-morrow.
004	NUM	016	017	And take each man his censer, and ye shall put incense upon them, and shall bring each one his censer before the Lord, two hundred and fifty censers, and thou and Aaron shall bring each his censer.
004	NUM	016	018	And each man took his censer, and they put on them fire, and laid incense on them; and Moses and Aaron stood by the doors of the tabernacle of witness.
004	NUM	016	019	And Core raised up against them all his company by the door of the tabernacle of witness; and the glory of the Lord appeared to all the congregation.
004	NUM	016	020	And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,
004	NUM	016	021	Separate your selves from the midst of this congregation, and I will consume them at once.
004	NUM	016	022	And they fell on their faces, and said, O God, the God of spirits and of all flesh, if one man has sinned, [shall] the wrath of the Lord [be] upon the whole congregation?
004	NUM	016	023	And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
004	NUM	016	024	Speak to the congregation, saying, Depart from the company of Core round about.
004	NUM	016	025	And Moses rose up and went to Dathan and Abiron, and all the elders of Israel went with him.
004	NUM	016	026	And he spoke to the congregation, saying, Separate yourselves from the tents of these stubborn men, and touch nothing that belongs to them, lest ye be consumed with them in all their sin.
004	NUM	016	027	And they stood aloof from the tent of Core round about; and Dathan and Abiron went forth and stood by the doors of their tents, and their wives and their children and their store.
004	NUM	016	028	And Moses said, Hereby shall ye know that the Lord has sent me to perform all these works, that [I have] not [done them] of myself.
004	NUM	016	029	If these men shall die according to the death of all men, if also their visitation shall be according to the visitation of all men, then the Lord has not sent me.
004	NUM	016	030	But if the Lord shall shew by a wonder, and the earth shall open her mouth and swallow them up, and their houses, and their tents, and all that belongs to them, and they shall go down alive into Hades, then ye shall know that these men have provoked the Lord.
004	NUM	016	031	And when he ceased speaking all these words, the ground clave asunder beneath them.
004	NUM	016	032	And the ground opened, and swallowed them up, and their houses, and all the men that were with Core, and their cattle.
004	NUM	016	033	And they went down and all that they had, alive into Hades; and the ground covered them, and they perished from the midst of the congregation.
004	NUM	016	034	And all Israel round about them fled from the sound of them, for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up [also].
004	NUM	016	035	And fire went forth from the Lord, and devoured the two hundred and fifty men that offered incense.
004	NUM	016	036	And the Lord said to Moses,
004	NUM	016	037	and to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, Take up the brazen censers out of the midst of the men that have been burnt, and scatter the strange fire yonder, for they have sanctified the censers
004	NUM	016	038	of these sinners against their own souls, and do thou make them beaten plates a covering to the altar, because they were brought before the Lord and hallowed; and they became a sign to the children of Israel.
004	NUM	016	039	And Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest took the brazen censers, which the men who had been burnt brought near, and they put them as a covering on the altar:
004	NUM	016	040	a memorial to the children of Israel that no stranger might draw nigh, who is not of the seed of Aaron, to offer incense before the Lord; so he shall not be as Core and as they that conspired with him, as the Lord spoke to him by the hand of Moses.
004	NUM	016	041	And the children of Israel murmured the next day against Moses and Aaron, saying, Ye have killed the people of the Lord.
004	NUM	016	042	And it came to pass when the congregation combined against Moses and Aaron, that they ran impetuously to the tabernacle of witness; and the cloud covered it, and the glory of the Lord appeared.
004	NUM	016	043	And Moses and Aaron went in, in front of the tabernacle of witness.
004	NUM	016	044	And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,
004	NUM	016	045	Depart out of the midst of this congregation, and I will consume them at once: and they fell upon their faces.
004	NUM	016	046	And Moses said to Aaron, Take a censer, and put on it fire from the altar, and put incense on it, and carry it away quickly into the camp, and make atonement for them; for wrath is gone forth from the presence of the Lord, it has begun to destroy the people.
004	NUM	016	047	And Aaron took as Moses spoke to him, and ran among the congregation, for already the plague had begun among the people; and he put on incense, and made an atonement for the people.
004	NUM	016	048	And he stood between the dead and the living, and the plague ceased.
004	NUM	016	049	And they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, besides those that died on account of Core.
004	NUM	016	050	And Aaron returned to Moses to the door of the tabernacle of witness, and the plague ceased.
004	NUM	017	001	And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
004	NUM	017	002	Speak to the children of Israel, and take rods of them, according to the houses of their families, a rod from all their princes, according to the houses of their families, twelve rods, and write the name of each on his rod.
004	NUM	017	003	And write the name of Aaron on the rod of Levi; for it is one rod [for each]: they shall give [them] according to the tribe of the house of their families.
004	NUM	017	004	And thou shalt put them in the tabernacle of witness, before the testimony, where I will be made known to thee.
004	NUM	017	005	And it shall be, the man whom I shall choose, his rod shall blossom; and I will remove from me the murmuring of the children of Israel, which they murmur against you.
004	NUM	017	006	And Moses spoke to the children of Israel, and all their chiefs gave him a rod [each], for one chief a rod, according to the house of their families, twelve rods; and the rod of Aaron [was] in the midst of the rods.
004	NUM	017	007	And Moses laid up the rods before the Lord in the tabernacle of witness.
004	NUM	017	008	And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of witness; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi blossomed, and put forth a bud, and bloomed blossoms and produced almonds.
004	NUM	017	009	And Moses brought forth all the rods from before the Lord to all the sons of Israel; and they looked, and each one took his rod.
004	NUM	017	010	And the Lord said to Moses, Lay up the rod of Aaron before the testimonies to be kept as a sign for the children of the disobedient; and let their murmuring cease from me, and they shall not die.
004	NUM	017	011	And Moses and Aaron did as the Lord commanded Moses, so did they.
004	NUM	017	012	And the children of Israel spoke to Moses, saying, Behold, we are cut off, we are destroyed, we are consumed.
004	NUM	017	013	Every one that touches the tabernacle of the Lord, dies: shall we die utterly?
004	NUM	018	001	And the Lord spoke to Aaron, saying, Thou and thy sons and thy father's house shall bear the sins of the holy things, and thou and thy sons shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood.
004	NUM	018	002	And take to thyself thy brethren the tribe of Levi, the family of thy father, and let them be joined to thee, and let them minister to thee; and thou and thy sons with thee [shall minister] before the tabernacle of witness.
004	NUM	018	003	And they shall keep thy charges, and the charges of the tabernacle; only they shall not approach the holy vessels and the altar, so both they and you shall not die.
004	NUM	018	004	And they shall be joined to thee, and shall keep the charges of the tabernacle of witness, in all the services of the tabernacle; and a stranger shall not approach to thee.
004	NUM	018	005	And ye shall keep the charges of the holy things, and the charges of the altar, and [so] there shall not be anger among the children of Israel.
004	NUM	018	006	And I have taken your brethren the Levites out of the midst of the children of Israel, a present given to the Lord, to minister in the services of the tabernacle of witness.
004	NUM	018	007	And thou and thy sons after thee shall keep up your priestly ministration, according to the whole manner of the altar, and that which is within the veil; and ye shall minister in the services as the office of your priesthood; and the stranger that comes near shall die.
004	NUM	018	008	And the Lord said to Aaron, And, behold, I have given you the charge of the first-fruits of all things consecrated to me by the children of Israel; and I have given them to thee as an honour, and to thy sons after thee for a perpetual ordinance.
004	NUM	018	009	And let this be to you from all the holy things that are consecrated [to me, even] the burnt-offerings, from all their gifts, and from all their sacrifices, and from every trespass-offering of theirs, and from all their sin-offerings, whatever things they give to me of all their holy things, they shall be thine and thy sons'.
004	NUM	018	010	In the most holy place shall ye eat them; every male shall eat them, thou and thy sons: they shall be holy to thee.
004	NUM	018	011	And this shall be to you of the first-fruits of their gifts, of all the wave-offerings of the children of Israel; to thee have I given them and to thy sons and thy daughters with thee, a perpetual ordinance; every clean person in thy house shall eat them.
004	NUM	018	012	Every first-offering of oil, and every first-offering of wine, their first-fruits of corn, whatsoever they may give to the Lord, to thee have I given them.
004	NUM	018	013	All the first-fruits that are in their land, whatsoever they shall offer to the Lord, shall be thine: every clean person in thy house shall eat them.
004	NUM	018	014	Every devoted thing among the children of Israel shall be thine.
004	NUM	018	015	And every thing that opens the womb of all flesh, whatsoever they bring to the Lord, whether man or beast, shall be thine: only the first-born of men shall be surely redeemed, and thou shalt redeem the first-born of unclean cattle.
004	NUM	018	016	And the redemption of them [shall be] from a month old; their valuation of five shekels—it is twenty oboli according to the holy shekel.
004	NUM	018	017	But thou shalt not redeem the first-born of calves and the first-born of sheep and the first-born of goats; they are holy: and thou shalt pour their blood upon the altar, and thou shalt offer the fat as a burnt-offering for a smell of sweet savour to the Lord.
004	NUM	018	018	And the flesh shall be thine, as also the breast of the wave-offering and as the right shoulder, it shall be thine.
004	NUM	018	019	Every special offering of the holy things, whatsoever the children of Israel shall specially offer to the Lord, I have given to thee and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee, a perpetual ordinance: it is a covenant of salt for ever before the Lord, for thee and thy seed after thee.
004	NUM	018	020	And the Lord said to Aaron, Thou shalt have no inheritance in their land, neither shalt thou have any portion among them; for I [am] thy portion and thine inheritance in the midst of the children of Israel.
004	NUM	018	021	And, behold, I have given to the sons of Levi every tithe in Israel for an inheritance for their services, whereinsoever they perform ministry in the tabernacle of witness.
004	NUM	018	022	And the children of Israel shall no more draw nigh to the tabernacle of witness to incur fatal guilt.
004	NUM	018	023	And the Levite himself shall perform the service of the tabernacle of witness; and they shall bear their iniquities, it is a perpetual statute throughout their generations; and in the midst of the children of Israel they shall not receive an inheritance.
004	NUM	018	024	Because I have given as a distinct portion to the Levites for an inheritance the tithes of the children of Israel, whatsoever they shall offer to the Lord; therefore I said to them, In the midst of the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.
004	NUM	018	025	And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
004	NUM	018	026	Thou shalt also speak to the Levites, and shalt say to them, If ye take the tithe from the children of Israel, which I have given you from them for an inheritance, then shall ye separate from it a heave-offering to the Lord, a tenth of the tenth.
004	NUM	018	027	And your heave-offerings shall be reckoned to you as corn from the floor, and an offering from the wine-press.
004	NUM	018	028	So shall ye also separate them from all the offerings of the Lord out of all your tithes, whatsoever ye shall receive from the children of Israel; and ye shall give of them an offering to the Lord to Aaron the priest.
004	NUM	018	029	Of all your gifts ye shall offer an offering to the Lord, and of every first-fruit the consecrated part from it.
004	NUM	018	030	And thou shalt say to them, When ye shall offer the first-fruits from it, then shall it be reckoned to the Levites as produce from the threshing-floor, and as produce from the wine-press.
004	NUM	018	031	And ye shall eat it in any place, ye and your families; for this is your reward for your services in the tabernacle of witness.
004	NUM	018	032	And ye shall not bear sin by reason of it, for ye shall have offered an offering of first-fruits from it, and ye shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, that ye die not.
004	NUM	019	001	And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,
004	NUM	019	002	This is the constitution of the law, as the Lord has commanded, saying, Speak to the sons of Israel, and let them take for thee a red heifer without spot, which has no spot on her, and on which no yoke has been put.
004	NUM	019	003	And thou shalt give her to Eleazar the priest; and they shall bring her out of the camp into a clean place, and shall kill her before his face.
004	NUM	019	004	And Eleazar shall take of her blood, and sprinkle of her blood seven times in front of the tabernacle of witness.
004	NUM	019	005	And they shall burn her to ashes before him; and her skin and her flesh and her blood, with her dung, shall be consumed.
004	NUM	019	006	And the priest shall take cedar wood and hyssop and scarlet wool, and they shall cast them into the midst of the burning of the heifer.
004	NUM	019	007	And the priest shall wash his garments, and bathe his body in water, and afterwards he shall go into the camp, and the priest shall be unclean till evening.
004	NUM	019	008	And he that burns her shall wash his garments, and bathe his body, and shall be unclean till evening.
004	NUM	019	009	And a clean man shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and lay them up in a clean place outside the camp; and they shall be for the congregation of the children of Israel to keep: it is the water of sprinkling, a purification.
004	NUM	019	010	And he that gathers up the ashes of the heifer shall wash his garments, and shall be unclean until evening; and it shall be a perpetual statute for the children of Israel and for the strangers joined to them.
004	NUM	019	011	He that touches the dead body of any man, shall be unclean seven days.
004	NUM	019	012	He shall be purified on the third day and the seventh day, and shall be clean; but if he be not purged on the third day and the seventh day, he shall not be clean.
004	NUM	019	013	Every one that touches the carcase of the person of a man, if he should have died, and [the other] not have been purified, has defiled the tabernacle of the Lord: that soul shall be cut off from Israel, because the water of sprinkling has not been sprinkled upon him; he is unclean; his uncleanness is yet upon him.
004	NUM	019	014	And this [is] the law; if a man die in a house, every one that goes into the house, and all things in the house, shall be unclean seven days.
004	NUM	019	015	And every open vessel which has not a covering bound upon it, shall be unclean.
004	NUM	019	016	And every one who shall touch a man slain by violence, or a corpse, or human bone, or sepulchre, shall be unclean seven days.
004	NUM	019	017	And they shall take for the unclean of the burnt ashes of purification, and they shall pour upon them running water into a vessel.
004	NUM	019	018	And a clean man shall take hyssop, and dip it into the water, and sprinkle it upon the house, and the furniture, and all the souls that are therein, and upon him that touched the human bone, or the slain man, or the corpse, or the tomb.
004	NUM	019	019	And the clean man shall sprinkle [the water] on the unclean on the third day and on the seventh day, and on the seventh day he shall purify himself; and [the other] shall wash his garments, and bathe himself in water, and shall be unclean until evening.
004	NUM	019	020	And whatever man shall be defiled and shall not purify himself, that soul shall be cut off from the midst of the congregation, because he has defiled the holy things of the Lord, because the water of sprinkling has not been sprinkled upon him; he is unclean.
004	NUM	019	021	And it shall be to you a perpetual statute; and he that sprinkles the water of sprinkling shall wash his garments; and he that touches the water of sprinkling shall be unclean until evening.
004	NUM	019	022	And whatsoever the unclean man shall touch shall be unclean, and the soul that touches it shall be unclean till evening.
004	NUM	020	001	And the children of Israel, [even] the whole congregation, came into the wilderness of Sin, in the first month, and the people abode in Cades; and Mariam died there, and was buried there.
004	NUM	020	002	And there was no water for the congregation: and they gathered themselves together against Moses and Aaron.
004	NUM	020	003	And the people reviled Moses, saying, Would we had died in the destruction of our brethren before the Lord!
004	NUM	020	004	And wherefore have ye brought up the congregation of the Lord into this wilderness, to kill us and our cattle?
004	NUM	020	005	And wherefore [is] this? Ye have brought us up out of Egypt, that we should come into this evil place; a place where there is no sowing, neither figs, nor vines, nor pomegranates, neither is there water to drink.
004	NUM	020	006	And Moses and Aaron went from before the assembly to the door of the tabernacle of witness, and they fell upon their faces; and the glory of the Lord appeared to them.
004	NUM	020	007	And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
004	NUM	020	008	Take thy rod, and call the assembly, thou and Aaron thy brother, and speak ye to the rock before them, and it shall give forth its waters; and ye shall bring forth for them water out of the rock, and give drink to the congregation and their cattle.
004	NUM	020	009	And Moses took his rod which was before the Lord, as the Lord commanded.
004	NUM	020	010	And Moses and Aaron assembled the congregation before the rock, and said to them, Hear me, ye disobedient ones; must we bring you water out of this rock?
004	NUM	020	011	And Moses lifted up his hand and struck the rock with his rod twice; and much water came forth, and the congregation drank, and their cattle.
004	NUM	020	012	And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, Because ye have not believed me to sanctify me before the children of Israel, therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them.
004	NUM	020	013	This is the water of Strife, because the children of Israel spoke insolently before the Lord, and he was sanctified in them.
004	NUM	020	014	And Moses sent messengers from Cades to the king of Edom, saying, Thus says thy brother Israel; Thou knowest all the distress that has come upon us.
004	NUM	020	015	And [how] our fathers went down into Egypt, and we sojourned in Egypt many days, and the Egyptians afflicted us and our fathers.
004	NUM	020	016	And we cried to the Lord, and the Lord heard our voice, and sent an angel and brought us out of Egypt; and now we are in the city of Cades, at the extremity of thy coasts.
004	NUM	020	017	We will pass through thy land: we will not go through the fields, nor through the vineyards, nor will we drink water out of thy cistern: we will go by the king's highway; we will not turn aside to the right hand or to the left, until we have passed thy borders.
004	NUM	020	018	And Edom said to him, Thou shalt not pass through me, and if otherwise, I will go forth to meet thee in war.
004	NUM	020	019	And the children of Israel say to him, We will pass by the mountain; and if I and my cattle drink of thy water, I will pay thee: but it is no matter of importance, we will go by the mountain.
004	NUM	020	020	And he said, Thou shalt not pass through me; and Edom went forth to meet him with a great host, and a mighty hand.
004	NUM	020	021	So Edom refused to allow Israel to pass through his borders, and Israel turned away from him.
004	NUM	020	022	And they departed from Cades; and the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, came to Mount Or.
004	NUM	020	023	And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron in mount Or, on the borders of the land of Edom, saying,
004	NUM	020	024	Let Aaron be added to his people; for ye shall certainly not go into the land which I have given the children of Israel, because ye provoked me at the water of strife.
004	NUM	020	025	Take Aaron, and Eleazar his son, and bring them up to the mount Or before all the congregation;
004	NUM	020	026	and take Aaron's apparel from off him, and put it on Eleazar his son: and let Aaron die there and be added to [his people].
004	NUM	020	027	And Moses did as the Lord commanded him, and took him up to mount Or, before all the congregation.
004	NUM	020	028	And he took Aaron's garments off him, and put them on Eleazar his son, and Aaron died on the top of the mountain; and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain.
004	NUM	020	029	And all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead: and they wept for Aaron thirty days, [even] all the house of Israel.
004	NUM	021	001	And Arad the Chananitish king who dwelt by the wilderness, heard that Israel came by the way of Atharin; and he made war on Israel, and carried off some of them captives.
004	NUM	021	002	And Israel vowed a vow to the Lord, and said, If thou wilt deliver this people into my power, I will devote it and its cities [to thee].
004	NUM	021	003	And the Lord hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered the Chananite into his power; and [Israel] devoted him and his cities, and they called the name of that place Anathema.
004	NUM	021	004	And having departed from mount Or by the way [leading] to the Red Sea, they compassed the land of Edom, and the people lost courage by the way.
004	NUM	021	005	And the people spoke against God and against Moses, saying, Why is this? Hast thou brought us ought of Egypt to slay us in the wilderness? for there is not bread nor water; and our soul loathes this light bread.
004	NUM	021	006	And the Lord sent among the people deadly serpents, and they bit the people, and much people of the children of Israel died.
004	NUM	021	007	And the people came to Moses and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the Lord, and against thee: pray therefore to the Lord, and let him take away the serpent from us.
004	NUM	021	008	And Moses prayed to the Lord for the people; and the Lord said to Moses, Make thee a serpent, and put it on a signal-[staff]; and it shall come to pass that whenever a serpent shall bite a man, every one [so] bitten that looks upon it shall live.
004	NUM	021	009	And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a signal-[staff]: and it came to pass that whenever a serpent bit a man, and he looked on the brazen serpent, he lived.
004	NUM	021	010	And the children of Israel departed, and encamped in Oboth.
004	NUM	021	011	And having departed from Oboth, they encamped in Achalgai, on the farther side in the wilderness, which is opposite Moab, toward the east.
004	NUM	021	012	And thence they departed, and encamped in the valley of Zared.
004	NUM	021	013	And they departed thence and encamped on the other side of Arnon in the wilderness, [the country] which extends from the coasts of the Amorites; for Arnon is the borders of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.
004	NUM	021	014	Therefore it is said in a book, A war of the Lord has set on fire Zoob, and the brooks of Arnon.
004	NUM	021	015	And he has appointed brooks to cause Er to dwell [there]; and it lies near to the coasts of Moab.
004	NUM	021	016	And thence [they came to] the well; this [is] the well of which the Lord said to Moses, Gather the people, and I will give them water to drink.
004	NUM	021	017	Then Israel sang this song at the well, Begin [to sing] of the well;
004	NUM	021	018	the princes digged it, the kings of the nations in their kingdom, in their lordship sank it in the rock: and [they went] from the well to Manthanain,
004	NUM	021	019	and from Manthanain to Naaliel, and from Naaliel to Bamoth, and from Bamoth to Janen, which is in the plain of Moab [as seen] from the top of the quarried [rock] that looks toward the wilderness.
004	NUM	021	020	And Moses sent ambassadors to Seon king of the Amorites, with peaceable words, saying,
004	NUM	021	021	We will pass through thy land, we will go by the road; we will not turn aside to the field or to the vineyard.
004	NUM	021	022	We will not drink water out of thy well; we will go by the king's highway, until we have past thy boundaries.
004	NUM	021	023	And Seon did not allow Israel to pass through his borders, and Seon gathered all his people, and went out to set the battle in array against Israel into the wilderness; and he came to Jassa, and set the battle in array against Israel.
004	NUM	021	024	And Israel smote him with the slaughter of the sword, and they became possessors of his land, from Arnon to Jaboc, as far as the children of Amman, for Jazer is the borders of the children of Amman.
004	NUM	021	025	And Israel took all their cities, and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Esebon, and in all cities belonging to it.
004	NUM	021	026	For Esebon is the city of Seon king of the Amorites; and he before fought against the king of Moab, and they took all his land, from Aroer to Arnon.
004	NUM	021	027	Therefore say they who deal in dark speeches, Come to Esebon, that the city of Seon may be built and prepared.
004	NUM	021	028	For a fire has gone forth from Esebon, a flame from the city of Seon, and has consumed as far as Moab, and devoured the pillars of Arnon.
004	NUM	021	029	Woe to thee, Moab; thou art lost, thou people of Chamos: their sons are sold for preservation, and their daughters are captives to Seon king of the Amorites.
004	NUM	021	030	And their seed shall perish [from] Esebon to Daebon; and their women have yet farther kindled a fire against Moab.
004	NUM	021	031	And Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites.
004	NUM	021	032	And Moses sent to spy out Jazer; and they took it, and its villages, and cast out the Amorite that dwelt there.
004	NUM	021	033	And having returned, they went up the road thhebraismat leads to Basan; and Og the king of Basan went forth to meet them, and all his people to war to Edrain.
004	NUM	021	034	And the Lord said to Moses, Fear him not; for I have delivered him and all his people, and all his land, into thy hands; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst to Seon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Esebon.
004	NUM	021	035	And he smote him and his sons, and all his people, until he left none of his to be taken alive; and they inherited his land.
004	NUM	022	001	And the children of Israel departed, and encamped on the west of Moab by Jordan toward Jericho.
004	NUM	022	002	And when Balac son of Sepphor saw all that Israel did to the Amorite,
004	NUM	022	003	then Moab feared the people exceedingly because they were many; and Moab was grieved before the face of the children of Israel.
004	NUM	022	004	And Moab said to the elders of Madiam, Now shall this assembly lick up all that are round about us, as a calf would lick up the green [herbs] of the field: —and Balac son of Sepphor was king of Moab at that time.
004	NUM	022	005	And he sent ambassadors to Balaam the son of Beor, to Phathura, which is on a river of the land of the sons of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, a people is come out of Egypt, and behold it has covered the face of the earth, and it has encamped close to me.
004	NUM	022	006	And now come, curse me this people, for it is stronger than we; if we may be able to smite some of them, and I will cast them out of the land: for I know that whomsoever thou dost bless, they are blessed, and whomsoever thou dost curse, they are cursed.
004	NUM	022	007	And the elders of Moab went, and the elders of Madiam, and their divining [instruments were] in their hands; and they came to Balaam, and spoke to him the words of Balac.
004	NUM	022	008	And he said to them, Tarry here the night, and I will answer you the things which the Lord shall say to me; and the princes of Moab stayed with Balaam.
004	NUM	022	009	And God came to Balaam, and said to him, Who are these men with thee?
004	NUM	022	010	And Balaam said to God, Balac son of Sepphor, king of Moab, sent them to me, saying,
004	NUM	022	011	Behold, a people has come forth out of Egypt, and has covered the face of the land, and it has encamped near to me; and now come, curse it for me, if indeed I shall be able to smite it, and cast it out of the land.
004	NUM	022	012	And God said to Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them, neither shalt thou curse the people; for they are blessed.
004	NUM	022	013	And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said to the princes of Balac, Depart quickly to your lord; God does not permit me to go with you.
004	NUM	022	014	And the princes of Moab rose, and came to Balac, and said, Balaam will not come with us.
004	NUM	022	015	And Balac yet again sent more princes and more honourable than they.
004	NUM	022	016	And they came to Balaam, and they say to him, Thus says Balac the son of Sepphor: I beseech thee, delay not to come to me.
004	NUM	022	017	For I will greatly honour thee, and will do for thee whatsoever thou shalt say; come then, curse me this people.
004	NUM	022	018	And Balaam answered and said to the princes of Balac, If Balac would give me his house full of silver and gold, I shall not be able to go beyond the word of the Lord God, to make it little or great in my mind.
004	NUM	022	019	And now do ye also tarry here this night, and I shall know what the Lord will yet say to me.
004	NUM	022	020	And God came to Balaam by night, and said to him, If these men are come to call thee, rise and follow them; nevertheless the word which I shall speak to thee, it shalt thou do.
004	NUM	022	021	And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab.
004	NUM	022	022	And God was very angry because he went; and the angel of the Lord rose up to withstand him. Now he had mounted his ass, and his two servants were with him.
004	NUM	022	023	And when the ass saw the angel of God standing opposite in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand, then the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field; and [Balaam] smote the ass with his staff to direct her in the way.
004	NUM	022	024	And the angel of the Lord stood in the avenues of the vines, a fence [being] on this side and a fence on that.
004	NUM	022	025	And when the ass saw the angel of God, she thrust herself against the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall, and he smote her again.
004	NUM	022	026	And the angel of the Lord went farther, and came and stood in a narrow place where it was impossible to turn to the right or the left.
004	NUM	022	027	And when the ass saw the angel of God, she lay down under Balaam; and Balaam was angry, and struck the ass with his staff.
004	NUM	022	028	And God opened the mouth of the ass, and she says to Balaam, What have I done to thee, that thou hast smitten me this third time?
004	NUM	022	029	And Balaam said to the ass, Because thou hast mocked me; and if I [had] had a sword in my hand, I would now have killed thee.
004	NUM	022	030	And the ass says to Balaam, [Am] not I thine ass on which thou hast ridden since thy youth till this day? did I ever do thus to thee, utterly disregarding [thee]? and he said, No.
004	NUM	022	031	And God opened the eyes of Balaam, and he sees the angel of the Lord withstanding [him] in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand, and he stooped down and worshipped on his face.
004	NUM	022	032	And the angel of God said to him, Why hast thou smitten thine ass this third time? and, behold, I came out to withstand thee, for thy way was not seemly before me; and when the ass saw me, she turned away from me this third time.
004	NUM	022	033	And if she had not turned out of the way, surely now, I should have slain thee, and should have saved her alive.
004	NUM	022	034	And Balaam said to the angel of the Lord, I have sinned, for I did not know that thou wert standing opposite in the way to meet [me]; and now if it shall not be pleasing to thee [for me to go on], I will return.
004	NUM	022	035	And the angel of the Lord said to Balaam, Go with the men: nevertheless the word which I shall speak to thee, that thou shalt take heed to speak. And Balaam went with the princes of Balac.
004	NUM	022	036	And when Balac heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him, to a city of Moab, which is on the borders of Arnon, which is on the [extreme] part of the borders.
004	NUM	022	037	And Balac said to Balaam, Did I not send to thee to call thee? why hast thou not come to me? shall I not indeed be able to honour thee?
004	NUM	022	038	And Balaam said to Balac, Behold, I am now come to thee: shall I be able to say anything? the word which God shall put into my mouth, that I shall speak.
004	NUM	022	039	And Balaam went with Balac, and they came to the cities of streets.
004	NUM	022	040	And Balac offered sheep and calves, and sent to Balaam and to his princes who were with him.
004	NUM	022	041	And it was morning; and Balac took Balaam, and brought him up to the pillar of Baal, and shewed him thence a part of the people.
004	NUM	023	001	And Balaam said to Balac, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven calves, and seven rams.
004	NUM	023	002	And Balac did as Balaam told him; and he offered up a calf and a ram on [every] altar.
004	NUM	023	003	And Balaam said to Balac, Stand by thy sacrifice, and I will go and see if God will appear to me and meet me, and the word which he shall shew me, I will report to thee. And Balac stood by his sacrifice.
004	NUM	023	004	And Balaam went to enquire of God; and he went straight forward, and God appeared to Balaam; and Balaam said to him, I have prepared the seven altars, and have offered a calf and a ram on [every] altar.
004	NUM	023	005	And God put a word into the mouth of Balaam, and said, thou shalt return to Balac, and thus shalt thou speak.
004	NUM	023	006	And he returned to him, and moreover he stood over his whole-burnt-offerings, and all the princes of Moab with him; and the Spirit of God came upon him.
004	NUM	023	007	And he took up his parable, and said, Balac king of Moab sent for me out of Mesopotamia, out of the mountains of the east, saying, Come, curse me Jacob, and Come, call for a curse for me upon Israel.
004	NUM	023	008	How can I curse whom the Lord curses not? or how can I devote whom God devotes not?
004	NUM	023	009	For from the top of the mountains I shall see him, and from the hills I shall observe him: behold, the people shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations.
004	NUM	023	010	Who has exactly calculated the seed of Jacob, and who shall number the families of Israel? let my soul die with the souls of the righteous, and let my seed be as their seed.
004	NUM	023	011	And Balac said to Balaam, What hast thou done to me? I called thee to curse my enemies, and behold thou hast greatly blessed [them].
004	NUM	023	012	And Balaam said to Balac, Whatsoever the Lord shall put into my mouth, shall I not take heed to speak this?
004	NUM	023	013	And Balac said to him, Come yet with me to another place where thou shalt not see the people, but only thou shalt see a part of them, and shalt not see them all; and curse me them from thence.
004	NUM	023	014	And he took him to a high place of the field to the top of the quarried [rock], and he built there seven altars, and offered a calf and a ram on [every] altar.
004	NUM	023	015	And Balaam said to Balac, Stand by thy sacrifice, and I will go to enquire of God.
004	NUM	023	016	And God met Balaam, and put a word into his mouth, and said, return to Balac, and thus shalt thou speak.
004	NUM	023	017	And he returned to him: and he also was standing by his whole-burnt-sacrifice, and all the princes of Moab with him; and Balac said to him, What has the Lord spoken?
004	NUM	023	018	And he took up his parable, and said, rise up, Balac, and hear; hearken as a witness, thou son of Sepphor.
004	NUM	023	019	God is not as man to waver, nor as the son of man to be threatened; shall he say and not perform? shall he speak and not keep [to his word]?
004	NUM	023	020	Behold, I have received [commandment] to bless: I will bless, and not turn back.
004	NUM	023	021	There shall not be trouble in Jacob, neither shall sorrow be seen in Israel: the Lord his God [is] with him, the glories of rulers [are] in him.
004	NUM	023	022	It was God who brought him out of Egypt; he has as it were the glory of a unicorn.
004	NUM	023	023	For there is no divination in Jacob, nor enchantment in Israel; in season it shall be told to Jacob and Israel what God shall perform.
004	NUM	023	024	Behold, the people shall rise up as a lion's whelp, and shall exalt himself as a lion; he shall not lie down till he have eaten the prey, and he shall drink the blood of the slain.
004	NUM	023	025	And Balac said to Balaam, Neither curse the people at all for me, nor bless them at all.
004	NUM	023	026	And Balaam answered and said to Balac, Spoke I not to thee, saying, Whatsoever thing God shall speak to me, that will I do?
004	NUM	023	027	And Balac said to Balaam, Come [and] I will remove thee to another place, if it shall please God, and curse me them from thence.
004	NUM	023	028	And Balac took Balaam to the top of Phogor, which extends to the wilderness.
004	NUM	023	029	And Balaam said to Balac, build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven calves, and seven rams.
004	NUM	023	030	And Balac did as Balaam told him, and offered a calf and a ram on [every] altar.
004	NUM	024	001	And when Balaam saw that it pleased God to bless Israel, he did not go according to his custom to meet the omens, but turned his face toward the wilderness.
004	NUM	024	002	And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and sees Israel encamped by their tribes; and the Spirit of God came upon him.
004	NUM	024	003	And he took up his parable and said, Balaam son of Beor says, the man who sees truly says,
004	NUM	024	004	he says who hears the oracle of the Mighty One, who saw a vision of God in sleep; his eyes were opened:
004	NUM	024	005	How goodly [are] thy habitations, Jacob, and thy tents, Israel!
004	NUM	024	006	as shady groves, and as gardens by a river, and as tents which God pitched, and as cedars by the waters.
004	NUM	024	007	There shall come a man out of his seed, and he shall rule over many nations; and the kingdom of Gog shall be exalted, and his kingdom shall be increased.
004	NUM	024	008	God led him out of Egypt; he has as it were the glory of a unicorn: he shall consume the nations of his enemies, and he shall drain their marrow, and with his darts he shall shoot through the enemy.
004	NUM	024	009	He lay down, he rested as a lion, and as a young lion; who shall stir him up? they that bless thee are blessed, and they that curse thee are cursed.
004	NUM	024	010	And Balac was angry with Balaam, and clapped his hands together; and Balac said to Balaam, I called thee to curse my enemy, and behold thou hast decidedly blessed [him] this third time.
004	NUM	024	011	Now therefore flee to thy place: I said, I will honour thee, but now the Lord has deprived thee of glory.
004	NUM	024	012	And Balaam said to Balac, Did I not speak to thy messengers also whom thou sentest to me, saying,
004	NUM	024	013	If Balac should give me his house full of silver and gold, I shall not be able to transgress the word of the Lord to make it good or bad by myself; whatsoever things God shall say, them will I speak.
004	NUM	024	014	And now, behold, I return to my place; come, I will advise thee of what this people shall do to thy people in the last days.
004	NUM	024	015	And he took up his parable and said, Balaam the son of Beor says, the man who sees truly says,
004	NUM	024	016	hearing the oracles of God, receiving knowledge from the Most High, and having seen a vision of God in sleep; his eyes were opened.
004	NUM	024	017	I will point to him, but not now; I bless him, but he draws not near: a star shall rise out of Jacob, a man shall spring out of Israel; and shall crush the princes of Moab, and shall spoil all the sons of Seth.
004	NUM	024	018	And Edom shall be an inheritance, and Esau his enemy shall be an inheritance [of Israel], and Israel wrought valiantly.
004	NUM	024	019	And [one] shall arise out of Jacob, and destroy out of the city him that escapes.
004	NUM	024	020	And having seen Amalec, he took up his parable and said, Amalec [is] the first of the nations; yet his seed shall perish.
004	NUM	024	021	And having seen the Kenite, he took up his parable and said, thy dwelling-place [is] strong; yet though thou shouldest put thy nest in a rock,
004	NUM	024	022	and though Beor should have a skillfully contrived hiding-place, the Assyrians shall carry thee away captive.
004	NUM	024	023	And he looked upon Og, and took up his parable and said, Oh, oh, who shall live, when God shall do these things?
004	NUM	024	024	And one shall come forth from the hands of the Citians, and shall afflict Assur, and shall afflict the Hebrews, and they shall perish together.
004	NUM	024	025	And Balaam rose up and departed and returned to his place, and Balac went to his own home.
004	NUM	025	001	And Israel sojourned in Sattin, and the people profaned itself by going a-whoring after the daughters of Moab.
004	NUM	025	002	And they called them to the sacrifices of their idols; and the people ate of their sacrifices, and worshipped their idols.
004	NUM	025	003	And Israel consecrated themselves to Beel-phegor; and the Lord was very angry with Israel.
004	NUM	025	004	And the Lord said to Moses, Take all the princes of the people, and make them examples [of judgment] for the Lord in the face of the sun, and the anger of the Lord shall be turned away from Israel.
004	NUM	025	005	And Moses said to the tribes of Israel, Slay ye every one his friend that is consecrated to Beel-phegor.
004	NUM	025	006	And, behold, a man of the children of Israel came and brought his brother to a Madianitish woman before Moses, and before all the congregation of the children of Israel; and they were weeping at the door of the tabernacle of witness.
004	NUM	025	007	And Phinees the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, and rose out of the midst of the congregation, and took a javelin in his hand,
004	NUM	025	008	and went in after the Israelitish man into the chamber, and pierced them both through, both the Israelitish man, and the woman through her womb; and the plague was stayed from the children of Israel.
004	NUM	025	009	And those that died in the plague were four and twenty thousand.
004	NUM	025	010	And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
004	NUM	025	011	Phinees the son of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest has caused my wrath to cease from the children of Israel, when I was exceedingly jealous among them, and I did not consume the children of Israel in my jealousy.
004	NUM	025	012	Thus do thou say [to him], Behold, I give him a covenant of peace:
004	NUM	025	013	and he and his seed after him shall have a perpetual covenant of priesthood, because he was zealous for his God, and made atonement for the children of Israel.
004	NUM	025	014	Now the name of the smitten Israelitish man, who was smitten with the Madianitish woman, [was] Zambri son of Salmon, prince of a house of the tribe of Symeon.

004	NUM	025	017	Plague the Madianites as enemies, and smite them,
004	NUM	025	018	for they are enemies to you by the treachery wherein they ensnare you through Phogor, and through Chasbi their sister, daughter of a prince of Madiam, who was smitten in the day of the plague because of Phogor.
004	NUM	026	001	And it came to pass after the plague, that the Lord spoke to Moses and Eleazar the priest, saying,
004	NUM	026	002	Take the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, from twenty years old and upward, according to the houses of their lineage, every one that goes forth to battle in Israel.

005	DEU	001	001	These [are] the words which Moses spoke to all Israel on this side Jordan in the desert towards the west near the Red Sea, between Pharan Tophol, and Lobon, and Aulon, and the gold works.
005	DEU	001	002	[It is] a journey of eleven days from Choreb to mount Seir as far as Cades Barne.
005	DEU	001	003	And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first [day] of the month, Moses spoke to all the children of Israel, according to all things which the Lord commanded him for them:
005	DEU	001	004	after he had smitten Seon king of the Amorites who dwelt in Esebon, and Og the king of Basan who dwelt in Astaroth and in Edrain;
005	DEU	001	005	beyond Jordan in the land of Moab, Moses began to declare this law, saying,
005	DEU	001	006	The Lord your God spoke to us in Choreb, saying, Let it suffice you to have dwelt [so long] in this mountain.
005	DEU	001	007	Turn ye and depart and enter into the mountain of the Amorites, and [go] to all that dwell near about Araba, to the mountain and the plain and to the south, and the land of the Chananites near the sea, and Antilibanus, as far as the great river, the river Euphrates.
005	DEU	001	008	Behold, [God] has delivered the land before you; go in and inherit the land, which I sware to your fathers, Abraam, and Isaac, and Jacob, to give it to them and to their seed after them.
005	DEU	001	009	And I spoke to you at that time, saying, I shall not be able by myself to bear you.
005	DEU	001	010	The Lord your God has multiplied you, and, behold, ye are to-day as the stars of heaven for multitude.
005	DEU	001	011	The Lord God of your fathers add to you a thousand-fold more than you are, and bless you as he has spoken to you.
005	DEU	001	012	How shall I alone be able to bear your labour, and your burden, and your gainsayings?
005	DEU	001	013	Take to yourselves wise and understanding and prudent men for your tribes, and I will set your leaders over you.
005	DEU	001	014	And ye answered me and said, The thing which thou hast told us [is] good to do.
005	DEU	001	015	So I took of you wise and understanding and prudent men, and I set them to rule over you as rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, and rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens, and officers to your judges.
005	DEU	001	016	And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear [causes] between your brethren, and judge rightly between a man and [his] brother, and the stranger that is with him.
005	DEU	001	017	Thou shalt not have respect to persons in judgment, thou shalt judge small and great equally; thou shalt not shrink from before the person of a man, for the judgment is God's; and whatsoever matter shall be too hard for you, ye shall bring it to me, and I will hear it.
005	DEU	001	018	And I charged upon you at that time all the commands which ye shall perform.
005	DEU	001	019	And we departed from Choreb, and went through all that great wilderness and terrible, which ye saw, by the way of the mountain of the Amorite, as the Lord our God charged us, and we came as far as Cades Barne.
005	DEU	001	020	And I said to you, Ye have come as far as the mountain of the Amorite, which the Lord our God gives to you:
005	DEU	001	021	behold, the Lord your God has delivered to us the land before you: go up and inherit it as the Lord God of your fathers said to you; fear not, neither be afraid.
005	DEU	001	022	And ye all came to me, and said, Let us send men before us, and let them go up to the land for us; and let them bring back to us a report of the way by which we shall go up, and of the cities into which we shall enter.
005	DEU	001	023	And the saying pleased me: and I took of you twelve men, one man of a tribe.
005	DEU	001	024	And they turned and went up to the mountain, and they came as far as the valley of the cluster, and surveyed it.
005	DEU	001	025	And they took in their hands of the fruit of the land, and brought it to you, and said, The land is good which the Lord our God gives us.
005	DEU	001	026	Yet ye would not go up, but rebelled against the words of the Lord our God.
005	DEU	001	027	And ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because the Lord hated us, he has brought us out of the land of Egypt to deliver us into the hands of the Amorites, to destroy us.
005	DEU	001	028	Whither do we go up? and your brethren drew away your heart, saying, [It is a] great nation and populous, and mightier than we; and [there are] cities great and walled up to heaven: moreover we saw there the sons of the giants.
005	DEU	001	029	And I said to you, Fear not, neither be ye afraid of them;
005	DEU	001	030	the Lord your God who goes before your face, he shall fight against them together with you effectually, according to all that he wrought for you in the land of Egypt;
005	DEU	001	031	and in this wilderness which ye saw, by the way of the mountain of the Amorite; how the Lord thy God will bear thee as a nursling, as if any man should nurse his child, through all the way which ye have gone until ye came to this place.
005	DEU	001	032	And in this matter ye believed not the Lord our God,
005	DEU	001	033	who goes before you in the way to choose you a place, guiding you in fire by night, shewing you the way by which ye go, and a cloud by day.
005	DEU	001	034	And the Lord heard the voice of your words, and being greatly provoked he sware, saying,
005	DEU	001	035	Not one of these men shall see this good land, which I sware to their fathers,
005	DEU	001	036	except Chaleb the son of Jephonne, he shall see it; and to him I will give the land on which he went up, and to his sons, because he attended to the things of the Lord.
005	DEU	001	037	And the Lord was angry with me for your sake, saying, Neither shalt thou by any means enter therein.
005	DEU	001	038	Joshua the son of Naue, who stands by thee, he shall enter in there; do thou strengthen him, for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.
005	DEU	001	039	And every young child who this day knows not good or evil, —they shall enter therein, and to them I will give it, and they shall inherit it.
005	DEU	001	040	And ye turned and marched into the wilderness, in the way by the Red Sea.
005	DEU	001	041	And ye answered and said, We have sinned before the Lord our God; we will go up and fight according to all that the Lord our God has commanded us: and having taken every one his weapons of war, and being gathered together, ye went up to the mountain.
005	DEU	001	042	And the Lord said to me, Tell them, Ye shall not go up, neither shall ye fight, for I am not with you; thus shall ye not be destroyed before your enemies.
005	DEU	001	043	And I spoke to you, and ye did not hearken to me; and ye transgressed the commandment of the Lord; and ye forced your way and went up into the mountain.
005	DEU	001	044	And the Amorite who dwelt in that mountain came out to meet you, and pursued you as bees do, and wounded you from Seir to Herma.
005	DEU	001	045	And ye sat down and wept before the Lord our God, and the Lord hearkened not to your voice, neither did he take heed to you.
005	DEU	001	046	And ye dwelt in Cades many days, as many days as ye dwelt [there].
005	DEU	002	001	And we turned and departed into the wilderness, by the way of the Red Sea, as the Lord spoke to me, and we compassed mount Seir many days.
005	DEU	002	002	And the Lord said to me,
005	DEU	002	003	Ye have compassed this mount long enough; turn therefore toward the north.
005	DEU	002	004	And charge the people, saying, Ye are going through the borders of your brethren the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir; and they shall fear you, and dread you greatly.
005	DEU	002	005	Do not engage in war against them, for I will not give you of their land even enough to set your foot upon, for I have given mount Seir to the children of Esau as an inheritance.
005	DEU	002	006	Buy food of them for money and eat, and ye shall receive water of them by measure for money, and drink.
005	DEU	002	007	For the Lord our God has blessed thee in every work of thy hands. Consider how thou wentest through that great and terrible wilderness: behold, the Lord thy God [has been] with thee forty years; thou didst not lack any thing.
005	DEU	002	008	And we passed by our brethren the children of Esau, who dwelt in Seir, by the way of Araba from Aelon and from Gesion Gaber; and we turned and passed by the way of the desert of Moab.
005	DEU	002	009	And the Lord said to me, Do not ye quarrel with the Moabites, and do not engage in war with them; for I will not give you of their land for an inheritance, for I have given Aroer to the children of Lot to inherit.
005	DEU	002	010	Formerly the Ommin dwelt in it, a great and numerous nation and powerful, like the Enakim.
005	DEU	002	011	These also shall be accounted Raphain like the Enakim; and the Moabites call them Ommin.
005	DEU	002	012	And the Chorrhite dwelt in Seir before, and the sons of Esau destroyed them, and utterly consumed them from before them; and they dwelt in their place, as Israel did to the land of his inheritance, which the Lord gave to them.
005	DEU	002	013	Now then, arise ye, [said I], and depart, and cross the valley of Zaret.
005	DEU	002	014	And the days in which we traveled from Cades Barne till we crossed the valley of Zaret, [were] thirty and eight years, until the whole generation of the men of war failed, dying out of the camp, as the Lord God sware to them.
005	DEU	002	015	And the hand of the Lord was upon them to destroy them out of the midst of the camp, until they were consumed.
005	DEU	002	016	And it came to pass when all the men of war dying out of the midst of the people had fallen,
005	DEU	002	017	that the Lord spoke to me, saying,
005	DEU	002	018	Thou shalt pass over this day the borders of Moab to Aroer;
005	DEU	002	019	and ye shall draw nigh to the children of Amman: do not quarrel with them, nor wage war with them; for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Amman for an inheritance, because I have given it to the children of Lot for an inheritance.
005	DEU	002	020	It shall be accounted a land of Raphain, for the Raphain dwelt there before, and the Ammanites call them Zochommin.
005	DEU	002	021	A great nation and populous, and mightier than you, as also the Enakim: yet the Lord destroyed them from before them, and they inherited [their land], and they dwelt [there] instead of them until this day.
005	DEU	002	022	As they did to the children of Esau that dwell in Seir, even as they destroyed the Chorrhite from before them, and inherited their country, and dwelt [therein] instead of them until this day.
005	DEU	002	023	And the Evites who dwell in Asedoth to Gaza, and the Cappadocians who came out of Cappadocia, destroyed them, and dwelt in their room.
005	DEU	002	024	Now then arise and depart, and pass over the valley of Arnon: behold, I have delivered into thy hands Seon the king of Esebon the Amorite, and his land: begin to inherit [it]: engage in war with him this day.
005	DEU	002	025	Begin to put thy terror and thy fear on the face of all the nations under heaven, who shall be troubled when they have heard thy name, and shall be in anguish before thee.
005	DEU	002	026	And I sent ambassadors from the wilderness of Kedamoth to Seon king of Esebon with peaceable words, saying,
005	DEU	002	027	I will pass through thy land: I will go by the road, I will not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.
005	DEU	002	028	Thou shalt give me food for money, and I will eat; and thou shalt give me water for money, and I will drink; I will only go through on my feet:
005	DEU	002	029	as the sons of Esau did to me, who dwelt in Seir, and the Moabites who dwelt in Aroer, until I shall have passed Jordan into the land which the Lord our God gives us.
005	DEU	002	030	And Seon king of Esebon would not that we should pass by him, because the Lord our God hardened his spirit, and made his heart stubborn, that he might be delivered into thy hands, as on this day.
005	DEU	002	031	And the Lord said to me, Behold, I have begun to deliver before thee Seon the king of Esebon the Amorite, and his land, and do thou begin to inherit his land.
005	DEU	002	032	And Seon the king of Esebon came forth to meet us, he and all his people to war at Jassa.
005	DEU	002	033	And the Lord our God delivered him before our face, and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people.
005	DEU	002	034	And we took possession of all his cities at that time, and we utterly destroyed every city in succession, and their wives, and their children; we left no living prey.
005	DEU	002	035	Only we took the cattle captive, and took the spoil of the cities.
005	DEU	002	036	From Aroer, which is by the brink of the brook of Arnon, and the city which is in the valley, and as far as the mount of Galaad; there was not a city which escaped us: the Lord our God delivered all of them into our hands.
005	DEU	002	037	Only we did not draw near to the children of Amman, even all the parts bordering on the brook Jaboc, and the cities in the mountain country, as the Lord our God charged us.
005	DEU	003	001	And we turned and went by the way leading to Basan; and Og the king of Basan came out to meet us, he and all his people, to battle at Edraim.
005	DEU	003	002	And the Lord said to me, Fear him not, for I have delivered him, and all his people, and all his land, into thy hands; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst to Seon king of the Amorites who dwelt in Esebon.
005	DEU	003	003	And the Lord our God delivered him into our hands, even Og the king of Basan, and all his people; and we smote him until we left none of his seed.
005	DEU	003	004	And we mastered all his cities at that time; there was not a city which we took not from them; sixty cities, all the country round about Argob, belonging to king Og in Basan:
005	DEU	003	005	all strong cities, lofty walls, gates and bars; besides the very many cities of the Pherezites.
005	DEU	003	006	We utterly destroyed [them] as we dealt with Seon the king of Esebon, so we utterly destroyed every city in order, and the women and the children,
005	DEU	003	007	and all the cattle; and we took for a prey to ourselves the spoil of the cities.
005	DEU	003	008	And we took at that time the land out of the hands of the two kings of the Amorites, who were beyond Jordan, [extending] from the brook of Arnon even unto Aermon.
005	DEU	003	009	The Phoenicians call Aermon Sanior, but the Amorite has called it Sanir.
005	DEU	003	010	All the cities of Misor, and all Galaad, and all Basan as far as Elcha and Edraim, cities of the kingdom of Og in Basan.
005	DEU	003	011	For only Og the king of Basan was left of the Raphain: behold, his bed [was] a bed of iron; behold, [it is] in the chief city of the children of Ammon; the length of it [is] nine cubits, and the breadth of it four cubits, according to the cubit of a man.
005	DEU	003	012	And we inherited that land at that time from Aroer, which is by the border of the torrent Arnon, and half the mount of Galaad; and I gave his cities to Ruben and to Gad.
005	DEU	003	013	And the rest of Galaad, and all Basan the kingdom of Og I gave to the half-tribe of Manasse, and all the country round about Argob, all that Basan; it shall be accounted the land of Raphain.
005	DEU	003	014	And Jair the son of Manasse took all the country round about Argob as far as the borders of Gargasi and Machathi: he called them by his name Basan Thavoth Jair until this day.
005	DEU	003	015	And to Machir I gave Galaad.
005	DEU	003	016	And to Ruben and to Gad I gave [the land] under Galaad as far as the brook of Arnon, the border between the brook and as far as Jaboc; the brook [is] the border to the children Amman.
005	DEU	003	017	And Araba and Jordan [are] the boundary of Machanareth, even to the sea of Araba, the salt sea under Asedoth Phasga eastward.
005	DEU	003	018	And I charged you at that time, saying, The Lord your God has given you this land by lot; arm yourselves, every one [that is] powerful, and go before your brethren the children of Israel.
005	DEU	003	019	Only your wives and your children and your cattle (I know that ye have much cattle), let them dwell in your cities which I have given you;
005	DEU	003	020	until the Lord your God give your brethren rest, as also he has given to you, and they also shall inherit the land, which the Lord our God gives them on the other side of Jordan; then ye shall return, each one to his inheritance which I have given you.
005	DEU	003	021	And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Your eyes have seen all things, which the Lord our God did to these two kings: so shall the Lord our God do to all the kingdoms against which thou crossest over thither.
005	DEU	003	022	Ye shall not be afraid of them, because the Lord our God himself shall fight for you.
005	DEU	003	023	And I besought the Lord at that time, saying,
005	DEU	003	024	Lord God, thou hast begun to shew to thy servant thy strength, and thy power, and thy mighty hand, and thy high arm: for what God is there in heaven or on the earth, who will do as thou hast done, and according to thy might?
005	DEU	003	025	I will therefore go over and see this good land that is beyond Jordan, this good mountain and Antilibanus.
005	DEU	003	026	And the Lord because of you did not regard me, and hearkened not to me; and the Lord said to me, Let it suffice thee, speak not of this matter to me any more.
005	DEU	003	027	Go up to the top of the quarried rock, and look with thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold [it] with thine eyes, for thou shalt not go over this Jordan.
005	DEU	003	028	And charge Joshua, and strengthen him, and encourage him; for he shall go before the face of this people, and he shall give them the inheritance of all the land which thou hast seen.
005	DEU	003	029	And we abode in the valley near the house of Phogor.
005	DEU	004	001	And now, Israel, hear the ordinances and judgments, all that I teach you this day to do: that ye may live, and be multiplied, and that ye may go in and inherit the land, which the Lord God of your fathers gives you.
005	DEU	004	002	Ye shall not add to the word which I command you, and ye shall not take from it: keep the commandments of the Lord our God, all that I command you this day.
005	DEU	004	003	Your eyes have seen all that the Lord our God did in [the case of] Beel-phegor; for every man that went after Beel-phegor, the Lord your God has utterly destroyed him from among you.
005	DEU	004	004	But ye that kept close to the Lord your God are all alive to-day.
005	DEU	004	005	Behold, I have shewn you ordinances and judgments as the Lord commanded me, that ye should do so in the land into which ye go to inherit it.
005	DEU	004	006	And ye shall keep and do them: for this is your wisdom and understanding before all nations, as many as shall hear all these ordinances; and they shall say, Behold, this great nation [is] a wise and understanding people.
005	DEU	004	007	For what manner of nation [is so] great, which has God so near to them as the Lord our God [is] in all things in whatsoever we may call upon him?
005	DEU	004	008	And what manner of nation [is so] great, which has righteous ordinances and judgments according to all this law, which I set before you this day?
005	DEU	004	009	Take heed to thyself, and keep thy heart diligently: forget not any of the things, which thine eyes have seen, and let them not depart from thine heart all the days of thy life; and thou shalt teach thy sons and thy sons' sons,
005	DEU	004	010	[even the things that happened in] the day in which ye stood before the Lord our God in Choreb in the day of the assembly; for the Lord said to me, Gather the people to me, and let them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days which they live upon the earth, and they shall teach their sons.
005	DEU	004	011	And ye drew nigh and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire up to heaven: [there was] darkness, blackness, [and] tempest.
005	DEU	004	012	And the Lord spoke to you out of the midst of the fire a voice of words, which ye heard: and ye saw no likeness, only [ye heard] a voice.
005	DEU	004	013	And he announced to you his covenant, which he commanded you to keep, even the ten commandments; and he wrote them on two tables of stone.
005	DEU	004	014	And the Lord commanded me at that time, to teach you ordinances and judgments, that ye should do them on the land, into which ye go to inherit it.
005	DEU	004	015	And take good heed to your hearts, for ye saw no similitude in the day in which the Lord spoke to you in Choreb in the mountain out of the midst of the fire:
005	DEU	004	016	lest ye transgress, and make to yourselves a carved image, any kind of figure, the likeness of male or female,
005	DEU	004	017	the likeness of any beast of those that are on the earth, the likeness of any winged bird which flies under heaven,
005	DEU	004	018	the likeness of any reptile which creeps on the earth, the likeness of any fish of those which are in the waters under the earth;
005	DEU	004	019	and lest having looked up to the sky, and having seen the sun and the moon and the stars, and all the heavenly bodies, thou shouldest go astray and worship them, and serve them, which the Lord thy God has distributed to all the nations under heaven.
005	DEU	004	020	But God took you, and led you forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the iron furnace, out of Egypt, to be to him a people of inheritance, as at this day.
005	DEU	004	021	And the Lord God was angry with me for the things said by you, and sware that I should not go over this Jordan, and that I should not enter into the land, which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance.
005	DEU	004	022	For I am to die in this land, and shall not pass over this Jordan; but ye are to pass over, and shall inherit this good land.
005	DEU	004	023	Take heed to yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the Lord our God, which he made with you, and ye transgress, and make to yourselves a graven image of any of the things concerning which the Lord thy God commanded thee.
005	DEU	004	024	For the Lord thy God is a consuming fire, a jealous God.
005	DEU	004	025	And when thou shalt have begotten sons, and shalt have sons' sons, and ye shall have dwelt a long time on the land, and shall have transgressed, and made a graven image of any thing, and shall have done wickedly before the Lord your God to provoke him;
005	DEU	004	026	I call heaven and earth this day to witness against you, that ye shall surely perish from off the land, into which ye go across Jordan to inherit it there; ye shall not prolong your days upon it, but shall be utterly cut off.
005	DEU	004	027	And the Lord shall scatter you among all nations, and ye shall be left few in number among all the nations, among which the Lord shall bring you.
005	DEU	004	028	And ye shall there serve other gods, the works of the hands of men, wood and stones, which cannot see, nor can they hear, nor eat, nor smell.
005	DEU	004	029	And there ye shall seek the Lord your God, and ye shall find him whenever ye shall seek him with all your heart, and with all your soul in your affliction.
005	DEU	004	030	And all these things shall come upon thee in the last days, and thou shalt turn to the Lord thy God, and shalt hearken to his voice.
005	DEU	004	031	Because the Lord thy God [is] a God of pity: he will not forsake thee, nor destroy thee; he will not forget the covenant of thy fathers, which the Lord sware to them.
005	DEU	004	032	Ask of the former days which were before thee, from the day when God created man upon the earth, and [beginning] at the [one] end of heaven to the other end of heaven, if there has happened any thing like to this great event, if such a thing has been heard:
005	DEU	004	033	if a nation have heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard and hast lived;
005	DEU	004	034	if God has assayed to go and take to himself a nation out of the midst of [another] nation with trial, and with signs, and with wonders, and with war, and with a mighty hand, and with a high arm, and with great sights, according to all the things which the Lord our God did in Egypt in thy sight.
005	DEU	004	035	So that thou shouldest know that the Lord thy God he is God, and there is none beside him.
005	DEU	004	036	His voice was made audible from heaven to instruct thee, and he shewed thee upon the earth his great fire, and thou heardest his words out of the midst of the fire.
005	DEU	004	037	Because he loved thy fathers, he also chose you their seed after them, and he brought thee himself with his great strength out of Egypt,
005	DEU	004	038	to destroy nations great and stronger than thou before thy face, to bring thee in, to give thee their land to inherit, as thou hast it this day.
005	DEU	004	039	An thou shalt know this day, and shalt consider in thine heart, that the Lord thy God he [is] God in heaven above, and on the earth beneath, and there is none else but he.
005	DEU	004	040	And keep ye his commandments, and his ordinances, all that I command you this day; that it may be well with thee, and with thy sons after thee, that ye may be long-lived upon the earth, which the Lord thy God giveth thee for ever.
005	DEU	004	041	Then Moses separated three cities beyond Jordan on the east,
005	DEU	004	042	that the slayer might flee thither, who should have slain his neighbour unintentionally, and should not have hated him in times past, and he shall flee to one of these cities and live:
005	DEU	004	043	Bosor in the wilderness, in the plain country of Ruben, and Ramoth in Galaad [belonging to] Gad, and Gaulon in Basan [belonging to] Manasse.
005	DEU	004	044	This [is] the law which Moses set before the children of Israel.
005	DEU	004	045	These [are] the testimonies, and the ordinances, and the judgments, which Moses spoke to the sons of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt:
005	DEU	004	046	on the other side of Jordan, in the valley near the house of Phogor, in the land of Seon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Esebon, whom Moses and the sons of Israel smote when they came out of the land of Egypt.
005	DEU	004	047	And they inherited his land, and the land of Og king of Basan, two kings of the Amorites, who were beyond Jordan eastward.
005	DEU	004	048	From Aroer, which is on the border of the brook Arnon, even to the mount of Seon, which is Aermon.
005	DEU	004	049	All Araba beyond Jordan eastward under Asedoth hewn in the rock.
005	DEU	005	001	And Moses called all Israel, and said to them, Hear, Israel, the ordinances and judgments, all that I speak in your ears this day, and ye shall learn them, and observe to do them.
005	DEU	005	002	The Lord your God made a covenant with you in Choreb.
005	DEU	005	003	The Lord did not make this covenant with your fathers, but with you: ye are all here alive this day.
005	DEU	005	004	The Lord spoke to you face to face in the mountain out of the midst of the fire.
005	DEU	005	005	And I stood between the Lord and you at that time to report to you the words of the Lord, (because ye were afraid before the fire, and ye went not up to the mountain) saying,
005	DEU	005	006	I am the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
005	DEU	005	007	Thou shalt have no other gods before my face.
005	DEU	005	008	Thou shalt not make to thyself an image, nor likeness of any thing, whatever things [are] in the heaven above, and whatever [are] in the earth beneath, and whatever [are] in the waters under the earth.
005	DEU	005	009	Thou shalt not bow down to them, nor shalt thou serve them; for I am the Lord thy God, a jealous God, visiting the sins of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generation to them that hate me,
005	DEU	005	010	and doing mercifully to thousands of them that love me, and that keep my commandments.
005	DEU	005	011	Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain, for the Lord thy God will certainly not acquit him that takes his name in vain.
005	DEU	005	012	Keep the sabbath day to sanctify it, as the Lord thy God commanded thee.
005	DEU	005	013	Six days thou shalt work, and thou shalt do all thy works;
005	DEU	005	014	but on the seventh day [is] the sabbath of the Lord thy God: thou shalt do in it no work, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, thy man-servant, and thy maid-servant, thine ox, and thine ass, and all thy cattle, and the stranger that sojourns in the midst of thee; that thy man-servant may rest, and thy maid, and thine ox, as well as thou.
005	DEU	005	015	And thou shalt remember that thou wast a slave in the land of Egypt, and the Lord thy God brought thee out thence with a mighty hand, and a high arm: therefore the Lord appointed thee to keep the sabbath day and to sanctify it.
005	DEU	005	016	Honour thy father and thy mother, as the Lord thy God commanded thee; that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest live long upon the land, which the Lord thy God gives thee.
005	DEU	005	017	Thou shalt not commit murder.
005	DEU	005	018	Thou shalt not commit adultery.
005	DEU	005	019	Thou shalt not steal.
005	DEU	005	020	Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.
005	DEU	005	021	Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife; thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, nor his field, nor his man-servant, nor his maid, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any beast of his, nor any thing that is thy neighbour's.
005	DEU	005	022	These words the Lord spoke to all the assembly of you in the mountain out of the midst of the fire—[there was] darkness, blackness, storm, a loud voice—and he added no more, and he wrote them on two tables of stone, and he gave them to me.
005	DEU	005	023	And it came to pass when ye heard the voice out of the midst of the fire, for the mountain burned with fire, that ye came to me, even all the heads of your tribes, and your elders:
005	DEU	005	024	and ye said, Behold, the Lord our God has shewn us his glory, and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire: this day we have seen that God shall speak to man, and he shall live.
005	DEU	005	025	And now let us not die, for this great fire will consume us, if we shall hear the voice of the Lord our God any more, and we shall die.
005	DEU	005	026	For what flesh [is there] which has heard the voice of the living God, speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we [have heard], and shall live?
005	DEU	005	027	Do thou draw near, and hear all that the Lord our God shall say, and thou shalt speak to us all things whatsoever the Lord our God shall speak to thee, and we will hear, and do.
005	DEU	005	028	And the Lord heard the voice of your words as ye spoke to me; and the Lord said to me, I have heard the voice of the words of this people, even all things that they have said to thee. [They have] well [said] all that they have spoken.
005	DEU	005	029	O that there were such a heart in them, that they should fear me and keep my commands always, that it might be well with them and with their sons for ever.
005	DEU	005	030	Go, say to them, Return ye to your houses;
005	DEU	005	031	but stand thou here with me, and I will tell thee all the commands, and the ordinances, and the judgments, which thou shalt teach them, and let them do so in the land which I give them for an inheritance.
005	DEU	005	032	And ye shall take heed to do as the Lord thy God commanded thee; ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left,
005	DEU	005	033	according to all the way which the Lord thy God commanded thee to walk in it, that he may give thee rest; and that it may be well with thee, and ye may prolong your days on the land which ye shall inherit.
005	DEU	006	001	And these [are] the commands, and the ordinances, and the judgments, as many as the Lord our God gave commandment to teach you to do so in the land on which ye enter to inherit it.
005	DEU	006	002	That ye may fear the Lord your God, keep ye all his ordinances, and his commandments, which I command thee to-day, thou, and thy sons, and thy sons' sons, all the days of thy life, that ye may live many days.
005	DEU	006	003	Hear, therefore, O Israel, and observe to do them, that it may be well with thee, and that ye may be greatly multiplied, as the Lord God of thy fathers said that he would give thee a land flowing with milk and honey: and these [are] the ordinances, and the judgments, which the Lord commanded the children of Israel in the wilderness, when they had gone forth from the land of Egypt.
005	DEU	006	004	Hear, O Israel, The Lord our God is one Lord.
005	DEU	006	005	And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy mind, and with all thy soul, and all thy strength.
005	DEU	006	006	And these words, all that I command thee this day, shall be in thy heart and in thy soul.
005	DEU	006	007	And thou shalt teach them to thy children, and thou shalt speak of them sitting in the house, and walking by the way, and lying down, and rising up.
005	DEU	006	008	And thou shalt fasten them for a sign upon thy hand, and it shall be immoveable before thine eyes.
005	DEU	006	009	And ye shall write them on the lintels of your houses and of your gates.
005	DEU	006	010	And it shall come to pass when the Lord thy God shall have brought thee into the land which he sware to thy fathers, to Abraam, and to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give thee great and beautiful cities which thou didst not build,
005	DEU	006	011	houses full of all good things which thou didst not fill, wells dug in the rock which thou didst not dig, vineyards and oliveyards which thou didst not plant, then having eaten and been filled,
005	DEU	006	012	beware lest thou forget the Lord thy God that brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
005	DEU	006	013	Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve; and thou shalt cleave to him, and by his name thou shalt swear.
005	DEU	006	014	Go ye not after other gods of the gods of the nations round about you;
005	DEU	006	015	for the Lord thy God in the midst of thee [is] a jealous God, lest the Lord thy God be very angry with thee, and destroy thee from off the face of the earth.
005	DEU	006	016	Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God, as ye tempted him in the temptation.
005	DEU	006	017	Thou shalt by all means keep the commands of the Lord thy God, the testimonies, and the ordinances, which he commanded thee.
005	DEU	006	018	And thou shalt do that which is pleasing and good before the Lord thy God, that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest go in and inherit the good land, which the Lord sware to your fathers,
005	DEU	006	019	to chase all thine enemies from before thy face, as the Lord said.
005	DEU	006	020	And it shall come to pass when thy son shall ask thee at a future time, saying, What are the testimonies, and the ordinances, and the judgments, which the Lord our God has commanded us?
005	DEU	006	021	Then shalt thou say to thy son, We were slaves to Pharao in the land of Egypt, and the Lord brought us forth thence with a mighty hand, and with a high arm.
005	DEU	006	022	And the Lord wrought signs and great and grievous wonders in Egypt, on Pharao and on his house before us.
005	DEU	006	023	And he brought us out thence to give us this land, which he sware to give to our fathers.
005	DEU	006	024	And the Lord charged us to observe all these ordinances; to fear the Lord our God, that it may be well with us for ever, that we may live, as even to-day.
005	DEU	006	025	And there shall be mercy to us, if we take heed to keep all these commands before the Lord our God, as he has commanded us.
005	DEU	007	001	And when the Lord thy God shall bring thee into the land, into which thou goest to possess it, and shall remove great nations from before thee, the Chettite, and Gergesite, and Amorite, and Chananite, and Pherezite, and Evite, and Jebusite, seven nations [more] numerous and stronger than you,
005	DEU	007	002	and the Lord thy God shall deliver them into thy hands, then thou shalt smite them: thou shalt utterly destroy them: thou shalt not make a covenant with them, neither shall ye pity them:
005	DEU	007	003	neither shall ye contract marriages with them: thou shalt not give thy daughter to his son, and thou shalt not take his daughter to thy son.
005	DEU	007	004	For he will draw away thy son from me, and he will serve other gods; and the Lord will be very angry with you, and will soon utterly destroy thee.
005	DEU	007	005	But thus shall ye do to them; ye shall destroy their altars, and shall break down their pillars, and shall cut down their groves, and shall burn with fire the graven images of their gods.
005	DEU	007	006	For thou art a holy people to the Lord thy God; and the Lord thy God chose thee to be to him a peculiar people beyond all nations that [are] upon the face of the earth.
005	DEU	007	007	It was not because ye are more numerous than all [other] nations that the Lord preferred you, and the Lord made choice of you: for ye are fewer in number than all [other] nations.
005	DEU	007	008	But because the Lord loved you, and as keeping the oath which he sware to your fathers, the Lord brought you out with a strong hand, and the Lord redeemed thee from the house of bondage, out of the hand of Pharao king of Egypt.
005	DEU	007	009	Thou shalt know therefore, that the Lord thy God, he [is] God, a faithful God, who keeps covenant and mercy for them that love him, and for those that keep his commandments to a thousand generations,
005	DEU	007	010	and who recompenses them that hate him to their face, to destroy them utterly; and will not be slack with them that hate him: he will recompense them to their face.
005	DEU	007	011	Thou shalt keep therefore the commands, and the ordinances, and these judgments, which I command thee this day to do.
005	DEU	007	012	And it shall come to pass when ye shall have heard these ordinances, and shall have kept and done them, that the Lord thy God shall keep for thee the covenant and the mercy, which he sware to your fathers.
005	DEU	007	013	And he will love thee, and bless thee, and multiply thee; and he will bless the off-spring of thy body, and the fruit of thy land, thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil, the herds of thine oxen, and the flocks of thy sheep, on the land which the Lord sware to thy fathers to give to thee.
005	DEU	007	014	Thou shalt be blessed beyond all nations; there shall not be among you an impotent or barren one, or among thy cattle.
005	DEU	007	015	And the Lord thy God shall remove from thee all sickness; and none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which thou hast seen, and all that thou hast known, will he lay upon thee; but he will lay them upon all that hate thee.
005	DEU	007	016	And thou shalt eat all the spoils of the nations which the Lord thy God gives thee; thine eye shall not spare them, and thou shalt not serve their gods; for this is an offence to thee.
005	DEU	007	017	But if thou shouldest say in thine heart, This nation [is] greater than I, how shall I be able to destroy them utterly?
005	DEU	007	018	thou shalt not fear them; thou shalt surely remember all that the Lord thy God did to Pharao and to all the Egyptians:
005	DEU	007	019	the great temptations which thine eyes have seen, those signs and great wonders, the strong hand, and the high arm; how the Lord thy God brought thee forth: so the Lord your God will do to all the nations, whom thou fearest in their presence.
005	DEU	007	020	And the Lord thy God shall send against them the hornets, until they that are left and they that are hidden from thee be utterly destroyed.
005	DEU	007	021	Thou shalt not be wounded before them, because the Lord thy God in the midst of thee [is] a great and powerful God.
005	DEU	007	022	And the Lord thy God shall consume these nations before thee by little and little: thou shalt not be able to consume them speedily, lest the land become desert, and the wild beasts of the field be multiplied against thee.
005	DEU	007	023	And the Lord thy God shall deliver them into thy hands, and thou shalt destroy them with a great destruction, until ye shall have utterly destroyed them.
005	DEU	007	024	And he shall deliver their kings into your hands, and ye shall destroy their name from that place; none shall stand up in opposition before thee, until thou shalt have utterly destroyed them.
005	DEU	007	025	Ye shall burn with fire the graven images of their gods: thou shalt not covet [their] silver, neither shalt thou take to thyself gold from them, lest thou shouldest offend thereby, because it is an abomination to the Lord thy God.
005	DEU	007	026	And thou shalt not bring an abomination into thine house, so shouldest thou be an accursed thing like it; thou shalt utterly hate it, and altogether abominate it, because it is an accursed thing.
005	DEU	008	001	Ye shall observe to do all the commands which I charge you to-day, that ye may live and be multiplied, and enter in and inherit the land, which the Lord your God sware [to give] to your fathers.
005	DEU	008	002	And thou shalt remember all the way which the Lord thy God led thee in the wilderness, that he might afflict thee, and try thee, and that the things in thine heart might be made manifest, whether thou wouldest keep his commandments or no.
005	DEU	008	003	And he afflicted thee and straitened thee with hunger, and fed thee with manna, which thy fathers knew not; that he might teach thee that man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God shall man live.
005	DEU	008	004	Thy garments grew not old from off thee, thy shoes were not worn from off thee, thy feet were not [painfully] hardened, lo! these forty years.
005	DEU	008	005	And thou shalt know in thine heart, that as if any man should chasten his son, so the Lord thy God will chasten thee.
005	DEU	008	006	And thou shalt keep the commands of the Lord thy God, to walk in his ways, and to fear him.
005	DEU	008	007	For the Lord thy God will bring thee into a good and extensive land, where there are torrents of waters, and fountains of deep places issuing through the plains and through the mountains:
005	DEU	008	008	a land of wheat and barley, [wherein are] vines, figs, pomegranates; a land of olive oil and honey;
005	DEU	008	009	a land on which thou shalt not eat thy bread with poverty, and thou shalt not want any thing upon it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of its mountains thou shalt dig brass.
005	DEU	008	010	And thou shalt eat and be filled, and shalt bless the Lord thy God on the good land, which he has given thee.
005	DEU	008	011	Take heed to thyself that thou forget not the Lord thy God, so as not to keep his commands, and his judgments, and ordinances, which I command thee this day:
005	DEU	008	012	lest when thou hast eaten and art full, and hast built goodly houses, and dwelt in them;
005	DEU	008	013	and thy oxen and thy sheep are multiplied to thee, and thy silver and thy gold are multiplied to thee, and all thy possessions are multiplied to thee,
005	DEU	008	014	thou shouldest be exalted in heart, and forget the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage:
005	DEU	008	015	who brought thee through that great and terrible wilderness, where [is] the biting serpent, and scorpion, and drought, where there was no water; who brought thee a fountain of water out of the flinty rock:
005	DEU	008	016	who fed thee with manna in the wilderness, which thou knewest not, and thy fathers knew not; that he might afflict thee, and thoroughly try thee, and do thee good in thy latter days.
005	DEU	008	017	Lest thou shouldest say in thine heart, My strength, and the power of mine hand have wrought for me this great wealth.
005	DEU	008	018	But thou shalt remember the Lord thy God, that he gives thee strength to get wealth; even that he may establish his covenant, which the Lord sware to thy fathers, as at this day.
005	DEU	008	019	And it shall come to pass if thou do at all forget the Lord thy God, and shouldest go after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that ye shall surely perish.
005	DEU	008	020	As also the other nations which the Lord God destroys before your face, so shall ye perish, because ye hearkened not to the voice of the Lord your God.
005	DEU	009	001	Hear, O Israel: Thou goest this day across Jordan to inherit nations greater and stronger than yourselves, cities great and walled up to heaven;
005	DEU	009	002	a people great and many and tall, the sons of Enac, whom thou knowest, and concerning whom thou hast heard [say], Who can stand before the children of Enac?
005	DEU	009	003	And thou shalt know to-day, that the Lord thy God he shall go before thy face: he is a consuming fire; he shall destroy them, and he shall turn them back before thee, and shall destroy them quickly, as the Lord said to thee.
005	DEU	009	004	Speak not in thine heart, when the Lord thy God has destroyed these nations before thy face, saying, For my righteousness the Lord brought me in to inherit this good land.
005	DEU	009	005	Not for thy righteousness, nor for the holiness of thy heart, dost thou go in to inherit their land, but because of the wickedness of these nations the Lord will destroy them from before thee, and that he may establish the covenant, which the Lord sware to our fathers, to Abraam, and to Isaac, and to Jacob.
005	DEU	009	006	And thou shalt know to-day, that [it is] not for thy righteousnesses the Lord thy God gives thee this good land to inherit, for thou art a stiff-necked people.
005	DEU	009	007	Remember, forget not, how much thou provokedst the Lord thy God in the wilderness: from the day that ye came forth out of Egypt, even till ye came into this place, ye continued to be disobedient toward the Lord.
005	DEU	009	008	Also in Choreb ye provoked the Lord, and the Lord was angry with you to destroy you;
005	DEU	009	009	when I went up into the mountain to receive the tables of stone, the tables of the covenant, which the Lord made with you, and I was in the mountain forty days and forty nights, I ate no bread and drank no water.
005	DEU	009	010	And the Lord gave me the two tables of stone written with the finger of God, and on them there had been written all the words which the Lord spoke to you in the mountain in the day of the assembly.
005	DEU	009	011	And it came to pass after forty days and forty nights, the Lord gave me the two tables of stone, the tables of the covenant.
005	DEU	009	012	And the Lord said to me, Arise, go down quickly from hence, for thy people whom thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt have transgressed; they have gone aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them, and have made themselves a molten image.
005	DEU	009	013	And the Lord spoke to me, saying, I have spoken to thee once and again, saying, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiff-necked people.
005	DEU	009	014	And now suffer me utterly to destroy them, and I will blot out their name from under heaven, and will make of thee a nation great and strong, and more numerous than this.
005	DEU	009	015	And I turned and went down from the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire to heaven; and the two tables of the testimonies [were] in my two hands.
005	DEU	009	016	And when I saw that ye had sinned against the Lord your God, and had made to yourselves a molten image, and had gone astray out of the way, which the Lord commanded you to keep;
005	DEU	009	017	then I took hold of the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and broke them before you.
005	DEU	009	018	And I made my petition before the Lord as also at the first forty days and forty nights: I ate no bread and drank no water, on account of all your sins which ye sinned in doing evil before the Lord God to provoke him.
005	DEU	009	019	And I was greatly terrified because of the wrath and anger, because the Lord was provoked with you utterly to destroy you; yet the Lord hearkened to me at this time also.
005	DEU	009	020	And he was angry with Aaron to destroy him utterly, and I prayed for Aaron also at that time.
005	DEU	009	021	And your sin which ye had made, [even] the calf, I took, and burnt it with fire, and pounded it and ground it down till it became fine; and it became like dust, and I cast the dust into the brook that descended from the mountain.
005	DEU	009	022	Also in the burning, and in the temptation, and at the graves of lust, ye provoked the Lord.
005	DEU	009	023	And when the Lord sent you forth from Cades Barne, saying, Go up and inherit the land which I give to you, then ye disobeyed the word of the Lord your God, and believed him not, and hearkened not to his voice.
005	DEU	009	024	Ye were disobedient in the things relating to the Lord from the day in which he became known to you.
005	DEU	009	025	And I prayed before the Lord forty days and forty nights, the number that I prayed [before], for the Lord said that he would utterly destroy you.
005	DEU	009	026	And I prayed to God, and said, O Lord, King of gods, destroy not thy people and thine inheritance, whom thou didst redeem, whom thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt with thy great power, and with thy strong hand, and with thy high arm.
005	DEU	009	027	Remember Abraam, and Isaac, and Jacob thy servants, to whom thou swarest by thyself: look not upon the hardness of heart of this people, and their impieties, and their sins.
005	DEU	009	028	Lest the inhabitants of the land whence thou broughtest us out speak, saying, Because the Lord could not bring them into the land of which he spoke to them, and because he hated them, has he brought them forth to slay them in the wilderness.
005	DEU	009	029	And these [are] thy people and thy portion, whom thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt with thy great strength, and with thy mighty hand, and with thy high arm.
005	DEU	010	001	At that time the Lord said to me, Hew for thyself two stone tables as the first, and come up to me into the mountain, and thou shalt make for thyself an ark of wood.
005	DEU	010	002	And thou shalt write upon the tables the words which were on the first tables which thou didst break, and thou shalt put them into the ark.
005	DEU	010	003	So I made an ark of boards of incorruptible wood, and I hewed tables of stone like the first, and I went up to the mountain, and the two tables were in my hand.
005	DEU	010	004	And he wrote upon the tables according to the first writing the ten commandments, which the Lord spoke to you in the mountain out of the midst of the fire, and the Lord gave them to me.
005	DEU	010	005	And I turned and came down from the mountain, and I put the tables into the ark which I had made; and there they were, as the Lord commanded me.
005	DEU	010	006	And the children of Israel departed from Beeroth of the sons of Jakim [to] Misadai: there Aaron died, and there he was buried, and Eleazar his son was priest in his stead.
005	DEU	010	007	Thence they departed to Gadgad; and from Gadgad to Etebatha, a land [wherein are] torrents of water.
005	DEU	010	008	At that time the Lord separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of the Lord, to stand near before the Lord, to minister and bless in his name to this day.
005	DEU	010	009	Therefore the Levites have no part nor inheritance among their brethren; the Lord himself [is] their inheritance, as he said to them.
005	DEU	010	010	And I remained in the mount forty days and forty nights: and the Lord heard me at that time also, and the Lord would not destroy you.
005	DEU	010	011	And the Lord said to me, Go, set out before this people, and let them go in and inherit the land, which I sware to their fathers to give to them.
005	DEU	010	012	And now, Israel, what does the Lord thy God require of thee, but to fear the Lord thy God, and to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul;
005	DEU	010	013	to keep the commandments of the Lord thy God, and his ordinances, all that I charge thee to-day, that it may be well with thee?
005	DEU	010	014	Behold, the heaven and the heaven of heavens belong to the Lord thy God, the earth and all things that are in it.
005	DEU	010	015	Only the Lord chose your fathers to love them, and he chose out their seed after them, [even] you, beyond all nations, as at this day.
005	DEU	010	016	Therefore ye shall circumcise the hardness of your heart, and ye shall not harden your neck.
005	DEU	010	017	For the Lord your God, he [is] God of gods, and the Lord of lords, the great, and strong, and terrible God, who does not accept persons, nor will he by any means accept a bribe:
005	DEU	010	018	executing judgment for the stranger and orphan and widow, and he loves the stranger to give him food and raiment.
005	DEU	010	019	And ye shall love the stranger; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.
005	DEU	010	020	Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God, and serve him, and shalt cleave to him, and shalt swear by his name.
005	DEU	010	021	He [is] thy boast, and he [is] thy God, who has wrought in the midst of thee these great and glorious things, which thine eyes have seen.
005	DEU	010	022	With seventy souls your fathers went down into Egypt; but the Lord thy God has made thee as the stars of heaven in multitude.
005	DEU	011	001	Therefore thou shalt love the Lord thy God, and shalt observe his appointments, and his ordinances, and his commandments, and his judgments, always.
005	DEU	011	002	And ye shall know this day; for [I speak] not to your children, who know not and have not seen the discipline of the Lord thy God, and his wonderful works, and his strong hand, and his high arm,
005	DEU	011	003	and his miracles, and his wonders, which he wrought in the midst of Egypt on Pharao king of Egypt, and all his land;
005	DEU	011	004	and what he did to the host of the Egyptians, and to their chariots, and their cavalry, and their host; how he made the water of the Red Sea to overwhelm the face of them as they pursued after you, and the Lord destroyed them until this day;
005	DEU	011	005	and all the things which he did to you in the wilderness until ye came into this place;
005	DEU	011	006	and all the things that he did to Dathan and Abiron the sons of Eliab the son of Ruben, whom the earth opening her mouth swallowed up, and their houses, and their tents, and all their substance that was with them, in the midst of all Israel:
005	DEU	011	007	for your eyes have seen all the mighty works of the Lord, which he wrought among you to-day.
005	DEU	011	008	And ye shall keep all his commandments, as many as I command thee to-day, that ye may live, and be multiplied, and that ye may go in and inherit the land, into which ye go across Jordan to inherit it:
005	DEU	011	009	that ye may live long upon the land, which the Lord sware to your fathers to give to them, and to their seed after them, a land flowing with milk and honey.
005	DEU	011	010	For the land into which thou goest to inherit it, is not as the land of Egypt, whence ye came out, whensoever they sow the seed, and water it with their feet, as a garden of herbs:
005	DEU	011	011	but the land into which thou goest to inherit it, is a land of mountains and plains; it shall drink water of the rain of heaven.
005	DEU	011	012	A land which the Lord thy God surveys continually, the eyes of the Lord thy God are upon it from the beginning of the year to the end of the year.
005	DEU	011	013	Now if ye will indeed hearken to all the commands which I charge thee this day, to love the Lord thy God, and to serve him with all thy heart, and with all thy soul,
005	DEU	011	014	then he shall give to thy land the early and latter rain in its season, and thou shalt bring in thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil.
005	DEU	011	015	And he shall give food in thy fields to thy cattle; and when thou hast eaten and art full,
005	DEU	011	016	take heed to thyself that thy heart be not puffed up, and ye transgress, and serve other gods, and worship them:
005	DEU	011	017	and the Lord be angry with you, and restrain the heaven; and there shall not be rain, and the earth shall not yield its fruit, and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land, which the Lord has given you.
005	DEU	011	018	And ye shall store these words in your heart and in your soul, and ye shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and it shall be fixed before your eyes.
005	DEU	011	019	And ye shall teach them to your children, so as to speak about them when thou sittest in the house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou sleepest, and when thou risest up.
005	DEU	011	020	And ye shall write them on the lintels of your houses, and on your gates;
005	DEU	011	021	that your days may be long, and the days of your children, upon the land which the Lord sware to your fathers to give to them, as the days of heaven upon the earth.
005	DEU	011	022	And it shall come to pass that if ye will indeed hearken to all these commands, which I charge thee to observe this day, to love the Lord our God, and to walk in all his ways, and to cleave close to him;
005	DEU	011	023	then the Lord shall cast out all these nations before you, and ye shall inherit great nations and stronger than yourselves.
005	DEU	011	024	Every place whereon the sole of your foot shall tread shall be your; from the wilderness and Antilibanus, and from the great river, the river Euphrates, even as far as the west sea shall be your coasts.
005	DEU	011	025	No one shall stand before you; and the Lord your God will put the fear of you and the dread of you on the face of all the land, on which ye shall tread, as he told you.
005	DEU	011	026	Behold, I set before you this day the blessing and the curse;
005	DEU	011	027	the blessing, if ye hearken to the commands of the Lord your God, all that I command you this day;
005	DEU	011	028	and the curse, if ye do not hearken to the commands of the Lord our God, as many as I command you this day, and ye wander from the way which I have commanded you, having gone to serve other gods, which ye know not.
005	DEU	011	029	And it shall come to pass when the Lord thy God shall have brought thee into the land into which thou goest over to inherit it, then thou shalt put blessing on mount Garizin, and the curse upon mount Gaebal.
005	DEU	011	030	Lo! are not these beyond Jordan, behind, westward in the land of Chanaan, which lies westward near Golgol, by the high oak?
005	DEU	011	031	For ye are passing over Jordan, to go in and inherit the land, which the Lord our God gives you to inherit always, and ye shall dwell in it.
005	DEU	011	032	And ye shall take heed to do all his ordinances, and these judgments, as many as I set before you to-day.
005	DEU	012	001	And these [are] the ordinances and the judgments, which ye shall observe to do in the land, which the Lord God of your fathers gives you for an inheritance, all the days which ye live upon the land.
005	DEU	012	002	Ye shall utterly destroy all the places in which they served their gods, whose [land] ye inherit, on the high mountains and on the hills, and under the thick tree.
005	DEU	012	003	And ye shall destroy their altars, and break in pieces their pillars, and ye shall cut down their groves, and ye shall burn with fire the graven images of their gods, and ye shall abolish their name out of that place.
005	DEU	012	004	Ye shall not do so to the Lord your God.
005	DEU	012	005	But in the place which the Lord thy God shall choose in one of your cities to name his name there, and to be called upon, ye shall even seek [him] out and go thither.
005	DEU	012	006	And ye shall carry thither your whole-burnt-offerings, and your sacrifices, and your first-fruits, and your vowed-offerings, and your freewill-offerings, and your offerings of thanksgiving, the first-born of your herds, and of your flocks.
005	DEU	012	007	And ye shall eat there before the Lord your God, and ye shall rejoice in all the things on which ye shall lay your hand, ye and your houses, as the Lord your God has blessed you.
005	DEU	012	008	Ye shall not do altogether as we do here to-day, every man that which is pleasing in his own sight.
005	DEU	012	009	For hitherto ye have not arrived at the rest and the inheritance, which the Lord our God gives you.
005	DEU	012	010	And ye shall go over Jordan, and shall dwell in the land, which the Lord our God takes as an inheritance for you; and he shall give you rest from all your enemies round about, and ye shall dwell safely.
005	DEU	012	011	And there shall be a place which the Lord thy God shall choose for his name to be called there, thither shall ye bring all things that I order you to-day; your whole-burnt-offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and the first-fruits of your hands, and every choice gift of yours, whatsoever ye shall vow to the Lord your God.
005	DEU	012	012	And ye shall rejoice before the Lord your God, ye and your sons, and your daughters, and your men-servants and your maid-servants, and the Levite that is at your gates; because he has no portion or inheritance with you.
005	DEU	012	013	Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy whole-burnt-offerings in any place which thou shalt see;
005	DEU	012	014	save in the place which the Lord thy God shall choose, in one of thy tribes, there shall ye offer your whole-burnt-offerings, and there shalt thou do all things whatsoever I charge thee this day.
005	DEU	012	015	But thou shalt kill according to all thy desire, and shalt eat flesh according to the blessing of the Lord thy God, which he has given thee in every city; the unclean that is within thee and the clean shall eat it on equal terms, as the doe or the stag.
005	DEU	012	016	Only ye shall not eat the blood; ye shall pour it out on the ground as water.
005	DEU	012	017	Thou shalt not be able to eat in thy cities the tithe of thy corn, and of thy wine, and of thine oil, the first-born of thine herd and of thy flock, and all [your] vows as many as ye shall have vowed, and your thank-offerings, and the first-fruits of thine hands.
005	DEU	012	018	But before the Lord thy God thou shalt eat it, in the place which the Lord thy God shall choose for himself, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, thy man-servant, and thy maid-servant, and the stranger that is within thy gates; and thou shalt rejoice before the Lord thy God, on whatsoever thou shalt lay thine hand.
005	DEU	012	019	Take heed to thyself that thou do not desert the Levite all the time that thou livest upon the earth.
005	DEU	012	020	And if the Lord thy God shall enlarge thy borders, as he said to thee, and thou shalt say, I will eat flesh; if thy soul should desire to eat flesh, thou shalt eat flesh according to all the desire of thy soul.
005	DEU	012	021	And if the place be far from thee, which the Lord thy God shall choose for himself, that his name be called upon it, then thou shalt kill of thy herd and of thy flock which God shall have given thee, even as I commanded thee, and thou shalt eat in thy cities according to the desire of thy soul.
005	DEU	012	022	As the doe and the stag are eaten, so shalt thou eat it; the unclean in thee and the clean shall eat it in like manner.
005	DEU	012	023	Take diligent heed that thou eat no blood, for blood [is] the life of it; the life shall not be eaten with the flesh.
005	DEU	012	024	Ye shall not eat [it]; ye shall pour it out on the ground as water.
005	DEU	012	025	Thou shalt not eat it, that it may be well with thee and with thy sons after thee, if thou shalt do that which is good and pleasing before the Lord thy God.
005	DEU	012	026	But thou shalt take thy holy things, if thou hast any, and thy vowed-offerings, and come to the place which the Lord thy God shall choose to have his name named upon it.
005	DEU	012	027	And thou shalt sacrifice thy whole-burnt-offerings, thou shalt offer the flesh upon the altar of the Lord thy God; but the blood of thy sacrifices thou shalt pour out at the foot of the altar of the Lord thy God, but the flesh thou shalt eat.
005	DEU	012	028	Beware and hearken, and thou shalt do all the commands which I charge thee, that it may be well with thee and with thy sons for ever, if thou shalt do that which is pleasing and good before the Lord thy God.
005	DEU	012	029	And if the Lord thy God shall utterly destroy the nations, to whom thou goest in thither to inherit their land, from before thee, and thou shalt inherit it, and dwell in their land;
005	DEU	012	030	take heed to thyself that thou seek not to follow them after they are destroyed before thee, saying, How do these nations act towards their gods? I will do likewise.
005	DEU	012	031	Thou shalt not do so to thy God; for they have sacrificed to their gods the abominations of the Lord which he hates, for they burn their sons and their daughters in fire to their gods.
005	DEU	012	032	Every word that I command you this day, it shalt thou observe to do: thou shalt not add to it, nor diminish from it.
005	DEU	013	001	And if there arise within thee a prophet, or one who dreams a dream, and he gives thee a sign or a wonder,
005	DEU	013	002	and the sign or the wonder come to pass which he spoke to thee, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which ye know not;
005	DEU	013	003	ye shall not hearken to the words of that prophet, or the dreamer of that dream, because the Lord thy God tries you, to know whether ye love your God with all your heart and with all your soul.
005	DEU	013	004	Ye shall follow the Lord your God, and fear him, and ye shall hear his voice, and attach yourselves to him.
005	DEU	013	005	And that prophet or that dreamer of a dream, shall die; for he has spoken to make thee err from the Lord thy God who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, who redeemed thee from bondage, to thrust thee out of the way which the Lord thy God commanded thee to walk in: so shalt thou abolish the evil from among you.
005	DEU	013	006	And if thy brother by thy father or mother, or thy son, or daughter, or thy wife in thy bosom, or friend who is equal to thine own soul, entreat thee secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which neither thou nor thy fathers have known,
005	DEU	013	007	of the gods of the nations that are round about you, who are near thee or at a distance from thee, from one end of the earth to the other;
005	DEU	013	008	thou shalt not consent to him, neither shalt thou hearken to him; and thine eye shall not spare him, thou shalt feel no regret for him, neither shalt thou at all protect him:
005	DEU	013	009	thou shalt surely report concerning him, and thy hands shall be upon him among the first to slay him, and the hands of all the people at the last.
005	DEU	013	010	And they shall stone him with stones, and he shall die, because he sought to draw thee away from the Lord thy God who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
005	DEU	013	011	And all Israel shall hear, and fear, and shall not again do according to this evil thing among you.
005	DEU	013	012	And if in one of thy cities which the Lord God gives thee to dwell therein, thou shalt hear men saying,
005	DEU	013	013	Evil men have gone out from you, and have caused all the inhabitants of their land to fall away, saying, Let us go and worship other gods, whom ye knew not,
005	DEU	013	014	then thou shalt enquire and ask, and search diligently, and behold, [if] the thing is clearly true, and this abomination has taken place among you,
005	DEU	013	015	thou shalt utterly destroy all the dwellers in that land with the edge of the sword; ye shall solemnly curse it, and all things in it.
005	DEU	013	016	And all its spoils thou shalt gather into its public ways, and thou shalt burn the city with fire, and all its spoils publicly before the Lord thy God; and it shall be uninhabited for ever, it shall not be built again.
005	DEU	013	017	And there shall nothing of the cursed thing cleave to thy hand, that the Lord may turn from his fierce anger, and shew thee mercy, and pity thee, and multiply thee, as he sware to thy fathers;
005	DEU	013	018	if thou wilt hear the voice of the Lord thy God, to keep his commandments, all that I charge thee this day, to do that which is good and pleasing before the Lord thy God.
005	DEU	014	001	Ye are the children of the Lord your God: ye shall not make any baldness between you eyes for the dead.
005	DEU	014	002	For thou art a holy people to the Lord thy God, and the Lord thy God has chosen thee to be a peculiar people to himself of all the nations on the face of the earth.
005	DEU	014	003	Ye shall not eat any abominable thing.
005	DEU	014	004	These [are] the beasts which ye shall eat; the calf of the herd, and lamb of the sheep, and kid of the goats;
005	DEU	014	005	the stag, and doe, and pygarg, and wild goat, and camelopard.
005	DEU	014	006	Every beast that divides the hoofs, and makes claws of two divisions, and that chews the cud among beasts, these ye shall eat.
005	DEU	014	007	And these ye shall not eat of them that chew the cud, and of those that divide the hoofs, and make distinct claws; the camel, and the hare, and the rabbit; because they chew the cud, and do not divide the hoof, these are unclean to you.
005	DEU	014	008	And as for the swine, because he divides the hoof, and makes claws of the hoof, yet he chews not the cud, he is unclean to you; ye shall not eat of their flesh, ye shall not touch their dead bodies.
005	DEU	014	009	And these ye shall eat of all that are in the water, ye shall eat all that have fins and scales.
005	DEU	014	010	And all that have not fins and scales ye shall not eat; they are unclean to you.
005	DEU	014	011	Ye shall eat every clean bird.
005	DEU	014	012	And these of them ye shall not eat; the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the sea-eagle,
005	DEU	014	013	and the vulture, and the kite and the like to it,
005	DEU	014	015	and the sparrow, and the owl, and the seamew,
005	DEU	014	016	and the heron, and the swan, and the stork,
005	DEU	014	017	and the cormorant, and the hawk, and its like, and the hoopoe, and the raven,
005	DEU	014	018	and the pelican, and the diver and the like to it, and the red-bill and the bat.
005	DEU	014	019	All winged animals that creep are unclean to you; ye shall not eat of them.
005	DEU	014	020	Ye shall eat every clean bird.
005	DEU	014	021	Ye shall eat nothing that dies of itself; it shall be given to the sojourner in thy cities and he shall eat it, or thou shalt sell it to a stranger, because thou art a holy people to the Lord thy God. Thou shalt not boil a lamb in his mother's milk.
005	DEU	014	022	Thou shalt tithe a tenth of all the produce of thy seed, the fruit of thy field year by year.
005	DEU	014	023	And thou shalt eat it in the place which the Lord thy God shall choose to have his name called there; ye shall bring the tithe of thy corn and of thy wine, and of thine oil, the first-born of thy herd and of thy flock, that thou mayest learn to fear the Lord thy God always.
005	DEU	014	024	And if the journey be too far for thee, and thou art not able to bring them, because the place [is] far from thee which the Lord thy God shall choose to have his name called there, because the Lord thy God will bless thee;
005	DEU	014	025	then thou shalt sell them for money, and thou shalt take the money in thy hands, and thou shalt go to the place which the Lord thy God shall choose.
005	DEU	014	026	And thou shalt give the money for whatsoever thy soul shall desire, for oxen or for sheep, or for wine, or [thou shalt lay it out] on strong drink, or on whatsoever thy soul may desire, and thou shalt eat there before the Lord thy God, and thou shalt rejoice and thy house,
005	DEU	014	027	and the Levite that is in thy cities, because he has not a portion or inheritance with thee.
005	DEU	014	028	After three years thou shalt bring out all the tithes of thy fruits, in that year thou shalt lay it up in thy cities.
005	DEU	014	029	And the Levite shall come, because he has no part or lot with thee, and the stranger, and the orphan, and the widow which is in thy cities; and they shall eat and be filled, that the Lord thy God may bless thee in all the works which thou shalt do.
005	DEU	015	001	Every seven years thou shalt make a release.
005	DEU	015	002	And this [is] the ordinance of the release: thou shalt remit every private debt which thy neighbour owes thee, and thou shalt not ask payment of it from thy brother; for it has been called a release to the Lord thy God.
005	DEU	015	003	Of a stranger thou shalt ask again whatsoever he has of thine, but to thy brother thou shalt remit his debt to thee.
005	DEU	015	004	For [thus] there shall not be a poor person in the midst of thee, for the Lord thy God will surely bless thee in the land which the Lord thy God gives thee by inheritance, that thou shouldest inherit it.
005	DEU	015	005	And if ye shall indeed hearken to the voice of the Lord your God, to keep and do all these commandments, as many as I charge thee this day,
005	DEU	015	006	(for the Lord thy God has blessed thee in the way of which he spoke to thee,) then thou shalt lend to many nations, but thou shalt not borrow; and thou shalt rule over many nations, but they shall not rule over thee.
005	DEU	015	007	And if there shall be in the midst of thee a poor [man] of thy brethren in one of thy cities in the land, which the Lord thy God gives thee, thou shalt not harden thine heart, neither shalt thou by any means close up thine hand from thy brother who is in want.
005	DEU	015	008	Thou shalt surely open thine hands to him, and shalt lend to him as much as he wants according to his need.
005	DEU	015	009	Take heed to thyself that there be not a secret thing in thine heart, an iniquity, saying, The seventh year, the year of release, draws nigh; and thine eye shall be evil to thy brother that is in want, and thou shalt not give to him, and he shall cry against thee to the Lord, and there shall be great sin in thee.
005	DEU	015	010	Thou shalt surely give to him, and thou shalt lend him as much as he wants, according as he is in need; and thou shalt not grudge in thine heart as thou givest to him, because on this account the Lord thy God will bless thee in all thy works, and in all things on which thou shalt lay thine hand.
005	DEU	015	011	For the poor shall not fail off thy land, therefore I charge thee to do this thing, saying, Thou shalt surely open thine hands to thy poor brother, and to him that is distressed upon thy land.
005	DEU	015	012	And if thy brother [or sister], a Hebrew man or a Hebrew woman, be sold to thee, he shall serve thee six years, and in the seventh year thou shalt send him out free from thee.
005	DEU	015	013	And when thou shalt send him out free from thee, thou shalt not send him out empty.
005	DEU	015	014	Thou shalt give him provision for the way from thy flock, and from thy corn, and from thy wine; as the Lord thy God has blessed thee, thou shalt give to him.
005	DEU	015	015	And thou shalt remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and the Lord thy God redeemed thee from thence; therefore I charge thee to do this thing.
005	DEU	015	016	And if he should say to thee, I will not go out from thee, because he continues to love thee and thy house, because he is well with thee;
005	DEU	015	017	then thou shalt take an awl, and bore his ear through to the door, and he shall be thy servant for ever; and in like manner shalt thou do to thy maid-servant.
005	DEU	015	018	It shall not seem hard to thee when they are sent out free from thee, because [thy servant] has served thee six years according to the annual hire of a hireling; so the Lord thy God shall bless thee in all things whatsoever thou mayest do.
005	DEU	015	019	Every first-born that shall be born among thy kine and thy sheep, thou shalt sanctify the males to the Lord thy God; thou shalt not work with thy first-born calf, and thou shalt not shear the first-born of thy sheep.
005	DEU	015	020	Thou shalt eat it before the Lord year by year in the place which the Lord thy God shall choose, thou and thy house.
005	DEU	015	021	And if there be in it a blemish, if it be lame or blind, an evil blemish, thou shalt not sacrifice it to the Lord thy God.
005	DEU	015	022	Thou shalt eat it in thy cities; the unclean in thee and the clean shall eat it in like manner, as the doe or the stag.
005	DEU	015	023	Only ye shall not eat the blood; thou shalt pour it out on the earth as water.
005	DEU	016	001	Observe the month of new [corn], and thou shalt sacrifice the passover to the Lord thy God; because in the month of new corn thou camest out of Egypt by night.
005	DEU	016	002	And thou shalt sacrifice the passover to the Lord thy God, sheep and oxen in the place which the Lord thy God shall choose to have his name called upon it.
005	DEU	016	003	Thou shalt not eat leaven with it; seven days shalt thou eat unleavened [bread] with it, bread of affliction, because ye came forth out of Egypt in haste; that ye may remember the day of your coming forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of your life.
005	DEU	016	004	Leaven shall not be seen with thee in all thy borders for seven days, and there shall not be left of the flesh which thou shalt sacrifice at even on the first day until the morning.
005	DEU	016	005	thou shalt not have power to sacrifice the passover in any of the cities, which the Lord thy God gives thee.
005	DEU	016	006	But in the place which the Lord thy God shall choose, to have his name called there, thou shalt sacrifice the passover at even at the setting of the sun, at the time when thou camest out of Egypt.
005	DEU	016	007	And thou shalt boil and roast and eat it in the place, which the Lord thy God shall choose; and thou shalt return in the morning, and go to thy house.
005	DEU	016	008	Six days shalt thou eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day is a holiday, a feast to the Lord thy God: thou shalt not do in it any work, save what must be done by any one.
005	DEU	016	009	Seven weeks shalt thou number to thyself; when thou hast begun [to put] the sickle to the corn, thou shalt begin to number seven weeks.
005	DEU	016	010	And thou shalt keep the feast of weeks to the Lord thy God, accordingly as thy hand has power in as many things as the Lord thy God shall give thee.
005	DEU	016	011	And thou shalt rejoice before the Lord thy God, thou and thy son, and thy daughter, thy man-servant and thy maid-servant, and the Levite, and the stranger, and the orphan, and the widow which dwells among you, in whatsoever place the Lord thy God shall choose, that his name should be called there.
005	DEU	016	012	And thou shalt remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and thou shalt observe and do these commands.
005	DEU	016	013	Thou shalt keep for thyself the feast of tabernacles seven days, when thou gatherest in [thy produce] from thy corn-floor and thy wine-press.
005	DEU	016	014	And thou shalt rejoice in thy feast, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, thy man-servant, and thy maid-servant, and the Levite, and the stranger, and the orphan, and the widow that is in thy cities.
005	DEU	016	015	Seven days shalt thou keep a feast to the Lord thy God in the place which the Lord thy God shall choose for himself; and if the Lord thy God shall bless thee in all thy fruits, and in every work of thy hands, then thou shalt rejoice.
005	DEU	016	016	Three times in the year shall all thy males appear before the Lord thy God in the place which the Lord shall choose in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles: thou shalt not appear before the Lord thy God empty.
005	DEU	016	017	Each one according to his ability, according to the blessing of the Lord thy God which he has given thee.
005	DEU	016	018	Thou shalt make for thyself judges and officers in thy cities, which the Lord thy God gives thee in [thy] tribes, and they shall judge the people with righteous judgment:
005	DEU	016	019	they shall not wrest judgment, nor favour persons, nor receive a gift; for gifts blind the eyes of the wise, and pervert the words of the righteous.
005	DEU	016	020	Thou shalt justly pursue justice, that ye may live, and go in and inherit the land which the Lord thy God gives thee.
005	DEU	016	021	Thou shalt not plant for thyself a grove; thou shalt not plant for thyself any tree near the altar of thy God.
005	DEU	016	022	Thou shalt not set up for thyself a pillar, which the Lord thy God hates.
005	DEU	017	001	Thou shalt not sacrifice to the Lord thy God a calf or a sheep, in which there is a blemish, [or] any evil thing; for it is an abomination to the Lord thy God.
005	DEU	017	002	And if there should be found in any one of thy cities, which the Lord thy God gives thee, a man or a woman who shall do that which is evil before the Lord thy God, so as to transgress his covenant,
005	DEU	017	003	and they should go and serve other gods, and worship them, the sun, or the moon, or any of the host of heaven, which he commanded thee not to do,
005	DEU	017	004	and it be told thee, and thou shalt have enquired diligently, and, behold, the thing really took place, this abomination has been done in Israel;
005	DEU	017	005	then shalt thou bring out that man, or that woman, and ye shall stone them with stones, and they shall die.
005	DEU	017	006	He shall die on the testimony of two or three witnesses; a man who is put to death shall not be put to death for one witness.
005	DEU	017	007	And the hand of the witnesses shall be upon him among the first to put him to death, and the hand of the people at the last; so shalt thou remove the evil one from among yourselves.
005	DEU	017	008	And if a matter shall be too hard for thee in judgment, between blood and blood, and between cause and cause, and between stroke and stroke, and between contradiction and contradiction, matters of judgment in your cities;
005	DEU	017	009	then thou shalt arise and go up to the place which the Lord thy God shall choose, and thou shalt come to the priests the Levites, and to the judge who shall be in those days, and they shall search out [the matter] and report the judgment to thee.
005	DEU	017	010	And thou shalt act according to the thing which they shall report to thee out of the place which the Lord thy God shall choose, and thou shalt observe to do all whatsoever shall have been by law appointed to thee.
005	DEU	017	011	Thou shalt do according to the law and to the judgment which they shall declare to thee: thou shalt not swerve to the right hand or to the left from any sentence which they shall report to thee.
005	DEU	017	012	And the man whosoever shall act in haughtiness, so as not to hearken to the priest who stands to minister in the name of the Lord thy God, or the judge who shall preside in those days, that man shall die, and thou shalt remove the evil one out of Israel.
005	DEU	017	013	And all the people shall hear and fear, and shall no more commit impiety.
005	DEU	017	014	And when thou shalt enter into the land which the Lord thy God gives thee, and shalt inherit it and dwell in it, and shalt say, I will set a ruler over me, as also the other nations round about me;
005	DEU	017	015	thou shalt surely set over thee the ruler whom the Lord God shall choose: of thy brethren thou shalt set over thee a ruler; thou shalt not have power to set over thee a stranger, because he is not thy brother.
005	DEU	017	016	For he shall not multiply to himself horses, and he shall by no means turn the people back to Egypt, lest he should multiply to himself horses; for the Lord said, Ye shall not any more turn back by that way.
005	DEU	017	017	And he shall not multiply to himself wives, lest his heart turn away; and he shall not greatly multiply to himself silver and gold.
005	DEU	017	018	And when he shall be established in his government, then shall he write for himself this repetition of the law into a book by the hands of the priests the Levites;
005	DEU	017	019	and it shall be with him, and he shall read in it all the days of his life, that he may learn to fear the Lord thy God, and to keep all these commandments, and to observe these ordinances:
005	DEU	017	020	that his heart be not lifted up above his brethren, that he depart not from the commandments on the right hand or on the left; that he and his sons may reign long in his dominion among the children of Israel.
005	DEU	018	001	The priests, the Levites, even the whole tribe of Levi, shall have no part nor inheritance with Israel; the burnt-offerings of the Lord [are] their inheritance, they shall eat them.
005	DEU	018	002	And they shall have no inheritance among their brethren; the Lord himself [is] his portion, as he said to him.
005	DEU	018	003	And this [is] the due of the priests in the things coming from the people from those who offer sacrifices, whether it be a calf or a sheep; and thou shalt give the shoulder to the priest, and the cheeks, and the great intestine:
005	DEU	018	004	and the first-fruits of thy corn, and of thy wine, and of thine oil; and thou shalt give to him the first-fruits of the fleeces of thy sheep:
005	DEU	018	005	because the Lord has chosen him out of all thy tribes, to stand before the Lord thy God, to minister and bless in his name, himself and his sons among the children of Israel.
005	DEU	018	006	And if a Levite come from one of the cities of all the children of Israel, where he himself dwells, accordingly as his mind desires, to the place which he shall have chosen,
005	DEU	018	007	he shall minister to the name of the Lord his God, as all his brethren the Levites, who stand there present before the Lord thy God.
005	DEU	018	008	He shall eat an allotted portion, besides the sale of his hereditary property.
005	DEU	018	009	And when thou shalt have entered into the land which the Lord thy God gives thee, thou shalt not learn to do according to the abominations of those nations.
005	DEU	018	010	There shall not be found in thee one who purges his son or his daughter with fire, one who uses divination, who deals with omens, and augury,
005	DEU	018	011	a sorcerer employing incantation, one who has in him a divining spirit, and observer of signs, questioning the dead.
005	DEU	018	012	For every one that does these things is an abomination to the Lord thy God; for because of these abominations the Lord will destroy them from before thy face.
005	DEU	018	013	Thou shalt be perfect before the Lord thy God.
005	DEU	018	014	For all these nations whose [land] thou shalt inherit, they will listen to omens and divinations; but the Lord thy God has not permitted thee so [to do].
005	DEU	018	015	The Lord thy God shall raise up to thee a prophet of thy brethren, like me; him shall ye hear:
005	DEU	018	016	according to all things which thou didst desire of the Lord thy God in Choreb in the day of the assembly, saying, We will not again hear the voice of the Lord thy God, and we will not any more see this great fire, and [so] we shall not die.
005	DEU	018	017	And the Lord said to me, They have spoken rightly all that they have said to thee.
005	DEU	018	018	I will raise up to them a prophet of their brethren, like thee; and I will put my words in his mouth, and he shall speak to them as I shall command him.
005	DEU	018	019	And whatever man shall not hearken to whatsoever words that prophet shall speak in my name, I will take vengeance on him.
005	DEU	018	020	But the prophet whosoever shall impiously speak in my name a word which I have not commanded him to speak, and whosoever shall speak in the name of other gods, that prophet shall die.
005	DEU	018	021	But if thou shalt say in thine heart, How shall we know the word which the Lord has not spoken?
005	DEU	018	022	Whatsoever words that prophet shall speak in the name of the Lord, and they shall not come true, and not come to pass, this [is] the thing which the Lord has not spoken; that prophet has spoken wickedly: ye shall not spare him.
005	DEU	019	001	And when the Lord thy God shall have destroyed the nations, which God gives thee, [even] the land, and ye shall inherit them, and dwell in their cities, and in their houses,
005	DEU	019	002	thou shalt separate for thyself three cities in the midst of thy land, which the Lord thy God gives thee.
005	DEU	019	003	Take a survey of thy way, and thou shalt divide the coasts of thy land, which the Lord thy God apportions to thee, into three parts, and there shall be there a refuge for every manslayer.
005	DEU	019	004	And this shall be the ordinance of the manslayer, who shall flee thither, and shall live, whosoever shall have smitten his neighbour ignorantly, whereas he hated him not in times past.
005	DEU	019	005	And whosoever shall enter with his neighbour into the thicket, to gather wood, if the hand of him that cuts wood with the axe should be violently shaken, and the axe head falling off from the handle should light on his neighbour, and he should die, he shall flee to one of these cities, and live.
005	DEU	019	006	Lest the avenger of blood pursue after the slayer, because his heart is hot, and overtake him, if the way be too long, and slay him, though there is to this man no sentence of death, because he hated him not in time past.
005	DEU	019	007	Therefore I charge thee, saying, Thou shalt separate for thy self three cities.
005	DEU	019	008	And if the Lord shall enlarge thy borders, as he sware to thy fathers, and the Lord shall give to thee all the land which he said he would give to thy fathers;
005	DEU	019	009	if thou shalt hearken to do all these commands, which I charge thee this day, to love the Lord thy God, to walk in all his ways continually; thou shalt add for thyself yet three cities to these three.
005	DEU	019	010	So innocent blood shall not be spilt in the land, which the Lord thy God gives thee to inherit, and there shall not be in thee one guilty of blood.
005	DEU	019	011	But if there should be in thee a man hating his neighbour, and he should lay wait for him, and rise up against him, and smite him, that he die, and he should flee to one of these cities,
005	DEU	019	012	then shall the elders of his city send, and take him thence, and they shall deliver him into the hands of the avengers of blood, and he shall die.
005	DEU	019	013	Thine eye shall not spare him; so shalt thou purge innocent blood from Israel, and it shall be well with thee.
005	DEU	019	014	Thou shalt not move the landmarks of thy neighbour, which thy fathers set in the inheritance, in which thou hast obtained a share in the land, which the Lord thy God gives thee to inherit.
005	DEU	019	015	One witness shall not stand to testify against a man for any iniquity, or for any fault, or for any sin which he may commit; by the mouth of two witnesses, or by the mouth of three witnesses, shall every word be established.
005	DEU	019	016	And if an unjust witness rise up against a man, alleging iniquity against him;
005	DEU	019	017	then shall the two men between whom the controversy is, stand before the Lord, and before the priests, and before the judges, who may be in those days.
005	DEU	019	018	And the judges shall make diligent inquiry, and, behold, [if] and unjust witness has borne unjust testimony; [and] has stood up against his brother;
005	DEU	019	019	then shall ye do to him as he wickedly devised to do against his brother, and thou shalt remove the evil from yourselves.
005	DEU	019	020	And the rest shall hear and fear, and do no more according to this evil thing in the midst of you.
005	DEU	019	021	Thine eye shall not spare him: [thou shalt exact] life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.
005	DEU	020	001	And if thou shouldest go forth to war against thine enemies, and shouldest see horse, and rider, and a people more numerous than thyself; thou shalt not be afraid of them, for the Lord thy God [is] with thee, who brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.
005	DEU	020	002	And it shall come to pass whenever thou shalt draw nigh to battle, that the priest shall draw nigh and speak to the people, and shall say to them,
005	DEU	020	003	Hear, O Israel; ye are going this day to battle against your enemies: let not your heart faint, fear not, neither be confounded, neither turn aside from their face.
005	DEU	020	004	For [it is] the Lord your God who advances with you, to fight with you against your enemies, [and] to save you.
005	DEU	020	005	And the scribes shall speak to the people, saying, What man [is] he that has built a new house, and has not dedicated it? let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the war, and another man dedicate it.
005	DEU	020	006	And what man [is] he that has planted a vineyard, and not been made merry with it? let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man be made merry with it.
005	DEU	020	007	And what man [is] he that has betrothed a wife, and has not taken her? let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man take her.
005	DEU	020	008	And the scribes shall speak further to the people, and say, What man [is] he that fears and is cowardly in his heart? Let him go and return to his house, lest he make the heart of his brother fail, as his own.
005	DEU	020	009	And it shall come to pass when the scribes shall have ceased speaking to the people, that they shall appoint generals of the army to be leaders of the people.
005	DEU	020	010	And if thou shalt draw nigh to a city to overcome them by war, then call them out peaceably.
005	DEU	020	011	If then they should answer peaceably to thee, and open to thee, it shall be that all the people found in it shall be tributary and subject to thee.
005	DEU	020	012	But if they will not hearken to thee, but wage war against thee, thou shalt invest it;
005	DEU	020	013	until the Lord thy God shall deliver it into thy hands, and thou shalt smite every male of it with the edge of the sword:
005	DEU	020	014	except the women and the stuff: and all the cattle, and whatsoever shall be in the city, and all the plunder thou shalt take as spoil for thyself, and shalt eat all the plunder of thine enemies whom the Lord thy God gives thee.
005	DEU	020	015	Thus shalt thou do to all the cities that are very far off from thee, not [being] of the cities of these nations which the Lord thy God gives thee to inherit their land.
005	DEU	020	016	[Of these] ye shall not take any thing alive;
005	DEU	020	017	but ye shall surely curse them, the Chettite, and the Amorite, and the Chananite, and the Pherezite, and the Evite, and the Jebusite, and the Gergesite; as the Lord thy God commanded thee:
005	DEU	020	018	that they may not teach you to do all their abominations, which they did to their gods, and [so] ye should sin before the Lord your God.
005	DEU	020	019	And if thou shouldest besiege a city many days to prevail against it by war to take it, thou shalt not destroy its trees, by applying an iron tool to them, but thou shalt eat of it, and shalt not cut it down: Is the tree that is in the field a man, to enter before thee into the work of the siege?
005	DEU	020	020	But the tree which thou knowest to be not fruit-bearing, this thou shalt destroy and cut down; and thou shalt construct a mound against the city, which makes war against thee, until it be delivered up.
005	DEU	021	001	And if one be found slain with the sword in the land, which the Lord thy God gives thee to inherit, having fallen in the field, and they do not know who has smitten [him];
005	DEU	021	002	thine elders and thy judges shall come forth, and shall measure the distances of the cities round about the slain man:
005	DEU	021	003	and it shall be that the city which is nearest to the slain man the elders of that city shall take a heifer of the herd, which has not laboured, and which has not borne a yoke.
005	DEU	021	004	And the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer into a rough valley, which has not been tilled and is not sown, and they shall slay the heifer in the valley.
005	DEU	021	005	And the priests the Levites shall come, because the Lord God has chosen them to stand by him, and to bless in his name, and by their word shall every controversy and every stroke be [decided].
005	DEU	021	006	And all the elders of that city who draw nigh to the slain man shall wash their hands over the head of the heifer which was slain in the valley;
005	DEU	021	007	and they shall answer and say, Our hands have not shed this blood, and our eyes have not seen [it].
005	DEU	021	008	Be merciful to thy people Israel, whom thou hast redeemed, O Lord, that innocent blood may not be charged on thy people Israel: and the blood shall be atoned for to them.
005	DEU	021	009	And thou shalt take away innocent blood from among you, if thou shouldest do that which is good and pleasing before the Lord thy God.
005	DEU	021	010	And if when thou goest out to war against thine enemies, the Lord thy God should deliver them into thine hands, and thou shouldest take their spoil,
005	DEU	021	011	and shouldest see among the spoil a woman beautiful in countenance, and shouldest desire her, and take her to thyself for a wife,
005	DEU	021	012	and shouldest bring her within thine house: then shalt thou shave her head, and pare her nails;
005	DEU	021	013	and shalt take away her garments of captivity from off her, and she shall abide in thine house, and shall bewail her father and mother the days of a month; and afterwards thou shalt go in to her and dwell with her, and she shall be thy wife.
005	DEU	021	014	And it shall be if thou do not delight in her, thou shalt send her out free; and she shall not by any means be sold for money, thou shalt not treat her contemptuously, because thou hast humbled her.
005	DEU	021	015	And if a man have two wives, the one loved and the other hated, and both the loved and the hated should have born him [children], and the son of the hated should be first-born;
005	DEU	021	016	then it shall be that whensoever he shall divide by inheritance his goods to his sons, he shall not be able to give the right of the first-born to the son of the loved one, having overlooked the son of the hated, which is the first-born.
005	DEU	021	017	But he shall acknowledge the first-born of the hated one to give to him double of all things which shall be found by him, because he is the first of his children, and to him belongs the birthright.
005	DEU	021	018	And if any man has a disobedient and contentious son, who hearkens not to the voice of his father and the voice of his mother, and they should correct him, and he should not hearken to them;
005	DEU	021	019	then shall his father and his mother take hold of him, and bring him forth to the elders of his city, and to the gate of the place:
005	DEU	021	020	and they shall say to the men of their city, This our son is disobedient and contentious, he hearkens not to our voice, he is a reveler and a drunkard.
005	DEU	021	021	And the men of his city shall stone him with stones, and he shall die; and thou shalt remove the evil one from yourselves, and the rest shall hear and fear.
005	DEU	021	022	And if there be sin in any one, [and] the judgment of death [be upon him], and he be put to death, and ye hang him on a tree:
005	DEU	021	023	his body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but ye shall by all means bury it in that day; for every one that is hanged on a tree is cursed of God; and ye shall by no means defile the land which the Lord thy God gives thee for an inheritance.
005	DEU	022	001	When thou seest the calf of thy brother or his sheep wandering in the way, thou shalt not overlook them; thou shalt by all means turn them back to thy brother, and thou shalt restore them to him.
005	DEU	022	002	And if thy brother do not come nigh thee, and thou dost not know him, thou shalt bring it into thy house within; and it shall be with thee until thy brother shall seek them, and thou shalt restore them to him.
005	DEU	022	003	Thus shalt thou do to his ass, and thus shalt thou do to his garment, and thus shalt thou do to every thing that thy brother has lost; whatsoever shall have been lost by him, and thou shalt have found, thou shalt not have power to overlook.
005	DEU	022	004	Thou shalt not see the ass of thy brother, or his calf, fallen in the way: thou shalt not overlook them, thou shalt surely help him to raise them up.
005	DEU	022	005	The apparel of a man shall not be on a woman, neither shall a man put on a woman's dress; for every one that does these things is an abomination to the Lord thy God.
005	DEU	022	006	And if thou shouldest come upon a brood of birds before thy face in the way or upon any tree, or upon the earth, young or eggs, and the mother be brooding on the young or the eggs, thou shalt not take the dam with the young ones.
005	DEU	022	007	Thou shalt by all means let the mother go, but thou shalt take the young to thyself; that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest live long.
005	DEU	022	008	If thou shouldest build a new house, then shalt thou make a parapet to thy house; so thou shalt not bring blood-guiltiness upon thy house, if one should in any wise fall from it.
005	DEU	022	009	Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with diverse seed, lest the fruit be devoted, and whatsoever seed thou mayest sow, with the fruit of thy vineyard.
005	DEU	022	010	Thou shalt not plough with an ox and an ass together.
005	DEU	022	011	Thou shalt not wear a mingled [garment], woollen and linen together.
005	DEU	022	012	Thou shalt make fringes on the four borders of thy garments, with which soever thou mayest be clothed.
005	DEU	022	013	And if any one should take a wife, and dwell with her, and hate her,
005	DEU	022	014	and attach to her reproachful words, and bring against her an evil name, and say, I took this woman, and when I came to her I found not her tokens of virginity:
005	DEU	022	015	then the father and the mother of the damsel shall take and bring out the damsel's tokens of virginity to the elders of the city to the gate.
005	DEU	022	016	And the father of the damsel shall say to the elders, I gave this my daughter to this man for a wife;
005	DEU	022	017	and now he has hated her, and attaches reproachful words to her, saying, I have not found tokens of virginity with thy daughter; and these [are] the tokens of my daughter's virginity. And they shall unfold the garment before the elders of the city.
005	DEU	022	018	And the elders of that city shall take that man, and shall chastise him,
005	DEU	022	019	and shall fine him a hundred shekels, and shall give [them] to the father of the damsel, because he has brought forth an evil name against a virgin of Israel; and she shall be his wife: he shall never be able to put her away.
005	DEU	022	020	But if this report be true, and the tokens of virginity be not found for the damsel;
005	DEU	022	021	then shall they bring out the damsel to the doors of her father's house, and shall stone her with stones, and she shall die; because she has wrought folly among the children of Israel, to defile the house of her father by whoring: so thou shalt remove the evil one from among you.
005	DEU	022	022	And if a man be found lying with a woman married to a man, ye shall kill them both, the man that lay with the woman, and the woman: so shalt thou remove the wicked one out of Israel.
005	DEU	022	023	And if there be a young damsel espoused to a man, and a man should have found her in the city and have lain with her;
005	DEU	022	024	ye shall bring them both out to the gate of their city, and they shall be stoned with stones, and they shall die; the damsel, because she cried not in the city; and the man, because he humbled his neighbour's spouse: so shalt thou remove the evil one from yourselves.
005	DEU	022	025	But if a man find in the field a damsel that is betrothed, and he should force her and lie with her, ye shall slay the man that lay with her only.
005	DEU	022	026	And the damsel has not [committed] a sin worthy of death; as if a man should rise up against his neighbour, and slay him, so [is] this thing;
005	DEU	022	027	because he found her in the field; the betrothed damsel cried, and there was none to help her.
005	DEU	022	028	And if any one should find a young virgin who has not been betrothed, and should force [her] and lie with her, and be found,
005	DEU	022	029	the man who lay with her shall give to the father of the damsel fifty silver didrachms, and she shall be his wife, because he has humbled her; he shall never be able to put her away.
005	DEU	022	030	A man shall not take his father's wife, and shall not uncover his father's skirt.
005	DEU	023	001	He that is fractured or mutilated in his private parts shall not enter into the assembly of the Lord.
005	DEU	023	002	[One born] of a harlot shall not enter into the assembly of the Lord.
005	DEU	023	003	The Ammanite and Moabite shall not enter into the assembly of the Lord, even until the tenth generation he shall not enter into the assembly of the Lord, even for ever:
005	DEU	023	004	because they met you not with bread and water by the way, when ye went out of Egypt; and because they hired against thee Balaam the son of Beor of Mesopotamia to curse thee.
005	DEU	023	005	But the Lord thy God would not hearken to Balaam; and the Lord thy God changed the curses into blessings, because the Lord thy God loved thee.
005	DEU	023	006	Thou shalt not speak peaceably or profitably to them all thy days for ever.
005	DEU	023	007	Thou shalt not abhor an Edomite, because he is thy brother; thou shalt not abhor an Egyptian, because thou wast a stranger in his land.
005	DEU	023	008	If sons be born to them, in the third generation they shall enter into the assembly of the Lord.
005	DEU	023	009	And if thou shouldest go forth to engage with thine enemies, then thou shalt keep thee from every wicked thing.
005	DEU	023	010	If there should be in thee a man who is not clean by reason of his issue by night, then he shall go forth out of the camp, and he shall not enter into the camp.
005	DEU	023	011	And it shall come to pass toward evening he shall wash his body with water, and when the sun has gone down, he shall go into the camp.
005	DEU	023	012	And thou shalt have a place outside of the camp, and thou shalt go out thither,
005	DEU	023	013	and thou shalt have a trowel on thy girdle; and it shall come to pass when thou wouldest relieve thyself abroad, that thou shalt dig with it, and shalt bring back the earth and cover thy nuisance.
005	DEU	023	014	Because the Lord thy God walks in thy camp to deliver thee, and to give up thine enemy before thy face; and thy camp shall be holy, and there shall not appear in thee a disgraceful thing, and [so] he shall turn away from thee.
005	DEU	023	015	Thou shalt not deliver a servant to his master, who [coming] from his master attaches himself to thee.
005	DEU	023	016	He shall dwell with thee, he shall dwell among you where he shall please; thou shalt not afflict him.
005	DEU	023	017	There shall not be a harlot of the daughters of Israel, and there shall not be a fornicator of the sons of Israel; there shall not be an idolatress of the daughters of Israel, and there shall not be an initiated person of the sons of Israel.
005	DEU	023	018	Thou shalt not bring the hire of a harlot, nor the price of a dog into the house of the Lord thy God, for any vow; because even both are an abomination to the Lord thy God.
005	DEU	023	019	Thou shalt not lend to thy brother on usury of silver, or usury of meat, or usury of any thing which thou mayest lend out.
005	DEU	023	020	Thou mayest lend on usury to a stranger, but to thy brother thou shalt not lend on usury; that the Lord thy God may bless thee in all thy works upon the land, into which thou art entering to inherit it.
005	DEU	023	021	And if thou wilt vow a vow to the Lord thy God, thou shalt not delay to pay it; for the Lord thy God will surely require it of thee, and [otherwise] it shall be sin in thee.
005	DEU	023	022	But if thou shouldest be unwilling to vow, it is not sin in thee.
005	DEU	023	023	Thou shalt observe the words that proceed from between thy lips; and as thou hast vowed a gift to the Lord God, [so] shalt thou do that which thou hast spoken with thy mouth.
005	DEU	023	024	And if thou shouldest go into the corn field of thy neighbour, then thou mayest gather the ears with thy hands; but thou shalt not put the sickle to thy neighbour's corn.
005	DEU	023	025	And if thou shouldest go into the vineyard of thy neighbour, thou shalt eat grapes sufficient to satisfy thy desire; but thou mayest not put them into a vessel.
005	DEU	024	001	And if any one should take a wife, and should dwell with her, then it shall come to pass if she should not have found favour before him, because he has found some unbecoming thing in her, that he shall write for her a bill of divorcement, and give it into her hands, and he shall send her away out of his house.
005	DEU	024	002	And [if] she should go away and be married to another man;
005	DEU	024	003	and the last husband should hate her, and write for her a bill of divorcement; and should give it into her hands, and send her away out of his house, and the last husband should die, who took her to himself for a wife;
005	DEU	024	004	the former husband who sent her away shall not be able to return and take her to himself for a wife, after she has been defiled; because it is an abomination before the Lord thy God, and ye shall not defile the land, which the Lord thy God gives thee to inherit.
005	DEU	024	005	And if any one should have recently taken a wife, he shall not go out to war, neither shall any thing be laid upon him; he shall be free in his house; for one year he shall cheer his wife whom he has taken.
005	DEU	024	006	Thou shalt not take for a pledge the under millstone, nor the upper millstone; for he who does so takes life for a pledge.
005	DEU	024	007	And if a man should be caught stealing one of his brethren of the children of Israel, and having overcome him he should sell him, that thief shall die; so shalt thou remove that evil one from yourselves.
005	DEU	024	008	Take heed to thyself in [regard of] the plague of leprosy: thou shalt take great heed to do according to all the law, which the priests the Levites shall report to you; take heed to do, as I have charged you.
005	DEU	024	009	Remember all that the Lord thy God did to Mariam in the way, when ye were going out of Egypt.
005	DEU	024	010	If thy neighbour owe thee a debt, any debt whatsoever, thou shalt not go into his house to take his pledge:
005	DEU	024	011	thou shalt stand without, and the man who is in thy debt shall bring the pledge out to thee.
005	DEU	024	012	And if the man be poor, thou shalt not sleep with his pledge.
005	DEU	024	013	Thou shalt surely restore his pledge at sunset, and he shall sleep in his garment, and he shall bless thee; and it shall be mercy to thee before the Lord thy God.
005	DEU	024	014	Thou shalt not unjustly withhold the wages of the poor and needy of thy brethren, or of the strangers who are in thy cities.
005	DEU	024	015	Thou shalt pay him his wages the same day, the sun shall not go down upon it, because he is poor and he trusts in it; and he shall cry against thee to the Lord, and it shall be sin in thee.
005	DEU	024	016	The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, and the sons shall not be put to death for the fathers; every one shall be put to death for his own sin.
005	DEU	024	017	Thou shalt not wrest the judgment of the stranger and the fatherless, and widow; thou shalt not take the widow's garment for a pledge.
005	DEU	024	018	And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt, and the Lord thy God redeemed thee from thence; therefore I charge thee to do this thing.
005	DEU	024	019	And when thou shalt have reaped corn in thy field, and shalt have forgotten a sheaf in thy field, thou shalt not return to take it; it shall be for the stranger, and the orphan, and the widow, that the Lord thy God may bless thee in all the works of thy hands.
005	DEU	024	020	And if thou shouldest gather thine olives, thou shalt not return to collect the remainder; it shall be for the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, and thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt; therefore I command thee to do this thing.
005	DEU	024	021	And when soever thou shalt gather the grapes of thy vineyard, thou shalt not glean what thou hast left; it shall be for the stranger, and the orphan, and the widow:
005	DEU	024	022	and thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt; therefore I command thee to do this thing.
005	DEU	025	001	And if there should be a dispute between men, and they should come forward to judgment, and [the judges] judge, and justify the righteous, and condemn the wicked:
005	DEU	025	002	then it shall come to pass, if the unrighteous should be worthy of stripes, thou shalt lay him down before the judges, and they shall scourge him before them according to his iniquity.
005	DEU	025	003	And they shall scourge him with forty stripes in number, they shall not inflict more; for if thou shouldest scourge him [with] more stripes beyond these stripes, thy brother will be disgraced before thee.
005	DEU	025	004	Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treads out the corn.
005	DEU	025	005	And if brethren should live together, and one of them should die, and should not have seed, the wife of the deceased shall not marry out [of the family] to a man not related: her husband's brother shall go in to her, and shall take her to himself for a wife, and shall dwell with her.
005	DEU	025	006	And it shall come to pass that the child which she shall bear, shall be named by the name of the deceased, and his name shall not be blotted out of Israel.
005	DEU	025	007	And if the man should not be willing to take his brother's wife, then shall the woman go up to the gate to the elders, and she shall say, My husband's brother will not raise up the name of his brother in Israel, my husband's brother has refused.
005	DEU	025	008	And the elders of his city shall call him, and speak to him; and if he stand and say, I will not take her:
005	DEU	025	009	then his brother's wife shall come forward before the elders, and shall loose one shoe from off his foot, and shall spit in his face, and shall answer and say, Thus shall they do to the man who will not build his brother's house in Israel.
005	DEU	025	010	And his name shall be called in Israel, The house of him that has had his shoe loosed.
005	DEU	025	011	And if men should strive together, a man with his brother, and the wife of one of them should advance to rescue her husband out of the hand of him that smites him, and she should stretch forth her hand, and take hold of his private parts;
005	DEU	025	012	thou shalt cut off her hand; thine eye shall not spare her.
005	DEU	025	013	Thou shalt not have in thy bag divers weights, a great and a small.
005	DEU	025	014	Thou shalt not have in thine house divers measures, a great and a small.
005	DEU	025	015	Thou shalt have a true and just weight, and a true and just measure, that thou mayest live long upon the land which the Lord thy God gives thee for an inheritance.
005	DEU	025	016	For every one that does this [is] an abomination to the Lord thy God, even every one that does injustice.
005	DEU	025	017	Remember what things Amalec did to thee by the way, when thou wentest forth out of the land of Egypt:
005	DEU	025	018	how he withstood thee in the way, and harassed thy rear, [even] those that were weary behind thee, and thou didst hunger and wast weary; and he did not fear God.
005	DEU	025	019	And it shall come to pass whenever the Lord thy God shall have given thee rest from all thine enemies round about thee, in the land which the Lord thy God gives thee to inherit, thou shalt blot out the name of Amalec from under heaven, and shalt not forget [to do it].
005	DEU	026	001	And it shall be when thou shalt have entered into the land, which the Lord thy God gives thee to inherit it, and thou shalt have inherited it, and thou shalt have dwelt upon it,
005	DEU	026	002	that thou shalt take of the first of the fruits of thy land, which the Lord thy God gives thee, and thou shalt put them into a basket, and thou shalt go to the place which the Lord thy God shall choose to have his name called there.
005	DEU	026	003	And thou shalt come to the priest who shall be in those days, and thou shalt say to him, I testify this day to the Lord my God, that I am come into the land which the Lord sware to our fathers to give to us.
005	DEU	026	004	And the priest shall take the basket out of thine hands, and shall set it before the altar of the Lord thy God:
005	DEU	026	005	and he shall answer and say before the Lord thy God, My father abandoned Syria, and went down into Egypt, and sojourned there with a small number, and became there a mighty nation and a great multitude.
005	DEU	026	006	And the Egyptians afflicted us, and humbled us, and imposed hard tasks on us:
005	DEU	026	007	and we cried to the Lord our God, and the Lord heard our voice, and saw our humiliation, and our labour, and our affliction.
005	DEU	026	008	And the Lord brought us out of Egypt himself with his great strength, and his mighty hand, and his high arm, and with great visions, and with signs, and with wonders.
005	DEU	026	009	And he brought us into this place, and gave us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey.
005	DEU	026	010	And now, behold, I have brought the first of the fruits of the land, which thou gavest me, O Lord, a land flowing with milk and honey: and thou shalt leave it before the Lord thy God, and thou shalt worship before the Lord thy God;
005	DEU	026	011	and thou shalt rejoice in all the good [things], which the Lord thy God has given thee, [thou] and thy family, and the Levite, and the stranger that is within thee.
005	DEU	026	012	And when thou shalt have completed all the tithings of thy fruits in the third year, thou shalt give the second tenth to the Levite, and stranger, and fatherless, and widow; and they shall eat it in thy cities, and be merry.
005	DEU	026	013	And thou shalt say before the Lord thy God, I have fully collected the holy things out of my house, and I have given them to the Levite, and the stranger, and the orphan, and the widow, according to all commands which thou didst command me: I did not transgress thy command, and I did not forget it.
005	DEU	026	014	And in my distress I did not eat of them, I have not gathered of them for an unclean purpose, I have not given of them to the dead; I have hearkened to the voice of the Lord our God, I have done as thou hast commanded me.
005	DEU	026	015	Look down from thy holy house, from heaven, and bless thy people Israel, and the land which thou hast given them, as thou didst swear to our fathers, to give to us a land flowing with milk and honey.
005	DEU	026	016	On this day the Lord thy God charged thee to keep all the ordinances and judgments; and ye shall observe and do them, with all your heart, and with all your soul.
005	DEU	026	017	Thou hast chosen God this day to be thy God, and to walk in all his ways, and to observe his ordinances and judgments, and to hearken to his voice.
005	DEU	026	018	And the Lord has chosen thee this day that thou shouldest be to him a peculiar people, as he said, to keep his commands;
005	DEU	026	019	and that thou shouldest be above all nations, as he has made thee renowned, and a boast, and glorious, that thou shouldest be a holy people to the Lord thy God, as he has spoken.
005	DEU	027	001	And Moses and the elders of Israel commanded, saying, Keep all these commands, all that I command you this day.
005	DEU	027	002	And it shall come to pass in the day when ye shall cross over Jordan into the land which the Lord thy God gives thee, that thou shalt set up for thyself great stones, and shalt plaster them with plaster.
005	DEU	027	003	And thou shalt write on these stones all the words of this law, as soon as ye have crossed Jordan, when ye are entered into the land, which the Lord God of thy fathers gives thee, a land flowing with milk and honey, according as the Lord God of thy fathers said to thee.
005	DEU	027	004	And it shall be as soon as ye are gone over Jordan, ye shall set up these stones, which I command thee this day, on mount Gaebal, and thou shalt plaster them with plaster.
005	DEU	027	005	And thou shalt build there an altar to the Lord thy God, an altar of stones; thou shalt not lift up iron upon it.
005	DEU	027	006	Of whole stones shalt thou build an altar to the Lord thy God, and thou shalt offer upon it whole-burnt-offerings to the Lord thy God.
005	DEU	027	007	And thou shalt there offer a peace-offering; and thou shalt eat and be filled, and rejoice before the Lord thy God.
005	DEU	027	008	And thou shalt write upon the stones all this law very plainly.
005	DEU	027	009	And Moses and the priests the Levites spoke to all Israel, saying, Be silent and hear, O Israel; this day thou art become a people to the Lord thy God.
005	DEU	027	010	And thou shalt hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God, and shalt do all his commands, and his ordinances, as many as I command thee this day.
005	DEU	027	011	And Moses charged the people on that day, saying,
005	DEU	027	012	These shall stand to bless the people on mount Garizin having gone over Jordan; Symeon, Levi, Judas, Issachar, Joseph, and Benjamin.
005	DEU	027	013	And these shall stand for cursing on mount Gaebal; Ruben, Gad, and Aser, Zabulon, Dan, and Nephthali.
005	DEU	027	014	And the Levites shall answer and say to all Israel with a loud voice,
005	DEU	027	015	Cursed [is] the man whosoever shall make a graven or molten image, an abomination to the Lord, the work of the hands of craftsmen, and shall put it in a secret place: and all the people shall answer and say, So be it.
005	DEU	027	016	Cursed is the man that dishonours his father or his mother: and all the people shall say, So be it.
005	DEU	027	017	Cursed is he that removes his neighbour's landmarks: and all the people shall say, So be it.
005	DEU	027	018	Cursed is he that makes the blind to wander in the way: and all the people shall say, So be it.
005	DEU	027	019	Cursed is every one that shall pervert the judgment of the stranger, and orphan, and widow: and all the people shall say, So be it.
005	DEU	027	020	Cursed is he that lies with his father's wife, because he has uncovered his father's skirt: and all the people shall say, So be it.
005	DEU	027	021	Cursed is he that lies with any beast: and all the people shall say, So be it.
005	DEU	027	022	Cursed is he that lies with his sister by his father or his mother: and all the people shall say, So be it.
005	DEU	027	023	Cursed is he that lies with his daughter-in-law: and all the people shall say, So be it. Cursed is he that lies with his wife's sister: and all the people shall say, So be it.
005	DEU	027	024	Cursed is he that smites his neighbour secretly: and all the people shall say, So be it.
005	DEU	027	025	Cursed is he whosoever shall have taken a bribe to slay an innocent man: and all the people shall say, So be it.
005	DEU	027	026	Cursed is every man that continues not in all the words of this law to do them: and all the people shall say, So be it.
005	DEU	028	001	And it shall come to pass, if thou wilt indeed hear the voice of the Lord thy God, to observe and do all these commands, which I charge thee this day, that the Lord thy God shall set thee on high above all the nations of the earth;
005	DEU	028	002	and all these blessings shall come upon thee, and shall find thee. If thou wilt indeed hear the voice of the Lord thy God,
005	DEU	028	003	blessed [shalt] thou [be] in the city, and blessed shalt thou be in the field.
005	DEU	028	004	Blessed shall be the offspring of thy body, and the fruits of thy land, and the herds of thy oxen, and the flocks of thy sheep.
005	DEU	028	005	Blessed shall be thy barns, and thy stores.
005	DEU	028	006	Blessed shalt thou be in thy coming in, and blessed shalt thou be in thy going out.
005	DEU	028	007	The Lord deliver thine enemies that withstand thee utterly broken before thy face: they shall come out against thee one way, and they shall flee seven ways from before thee.
005	DEU	028	008	The Lord send upon thee his blessing in thy barns, and on all on which thou shalt put thine hand, in the land which the Lord thy God gives thee.
005	DEU	028	009	The Lord raise thee up for himself a holy people, as he sware to thy fathers; if thou wilt hear the voice of the Lord thy God, and walk in all his ways.
005	DEU	028	010	And all the nations of the earth shall see thee, that the name of the Lord is called upon thee, and they shall stand in awe of thee.
005	DEU	028	011	And the Lord thy God shall multiply thee for good in the offspring of thy body, and in the offspring of thy cattle, and in the fruits of thy land, on thy land which the Lord sware to thy fathers to give to thee.
005	DEU	028	012	May the Lord open to thee his good treasure, the heaven, to give rain to thy land in season: may he bless all the works of thy hands: so shalt thou lend to many nations, but thou shalt not borrow; and thou shalt rule over many nations, but they shall not rule over thee.
005	DEU	028	013	The Lord thy God make thee the head, and not the tail; and thou shalt then be above and thou shalt not be below, if thou wilt hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God, in all things that I charge thee this day to observe.
005	DEU	028	014	Thou shalt not turn aside from any of the commandments, which I charge thee this day, to the right hand or to the left, to go after other gods to serve them.
005	DEU	028	015	But it shall come to pass, if thou wilt not hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God, to observe all his commandments, as many as I charge thee this day, then all these curses shall come on thee, and overtake thee.
005	DEU	028	016	Cursed [shalt] thou [be] in the city, and cursed shalt thou be in the field.
005	DEU	028	017	Cursed shall be thy barns and thy stores.
005	DEU	028	018	Cursed shall be the offspring of thy body, and the fruits of thy land, the herds of thine oxen, and the flocks of thy sheep.
005	DEU	028	019	Cursed shalt thou be in thy coming in, and cursed shalt thou be in thy going out.
005	DEU	028	020	The Lord send upon thee want, and famine, and consumption of all things on which thou shalt put thy hand, until he shall have utterly destroyed thee, and until he shall have consumed thee quickly because of thine evil devices, because thou hast forsaken me.
005	DEU	028	021	The Lord cause the pestilence to cleave to thee, until he shall have consumed thee off the land into which thou goest to inherit it.
005	DEU	028	022	The Lord smite thee with distress, and fever, and cold, and inflammation, and blighting, and paleness, and they shall pursue thee until they have destroyed thee.
005	DEU	028	023	And thou shalt have over thine head a sky of brass, and the earth under thee shall be iron.
005	DEU	028	024	The Lord thy God make the rain of thy land dust; and dust shall come down from heaven, until it shall have destroyed thee, and until it shall have quickly consumed thee.
005	DEU	028	025	The Lord give thee up for slaughter before thine enemies: thou shalt go out against them one way, and flee from their face seven ways; and thou shalt be a dispersion in all the kingdoms of the earth.
005	DEU	028	026	And your dead men shall be food to the birds of the sky, and to the beasts of the earth; and there shall be none to scare them away.
005	DEU	028	027	The Lord smite thee with the botch of Egypt in the seat, and with a malignant scab, and itch, so that thou canst not be healed.
005	DEU	028	028	The Lord smite thee with insanity, and blindness, and astonishment of mind.
005	DEU	028	029	And thou shalt grope at mid-day, as a blind man would grope in the darkness, and thou shalt not prosper in thy ways; and then thou shalt be unjustly treated, and plundered continually, and there shall be no helper.
005	DEU	028	030	thou shalt take a wife, and another man shall have her; thou shalt build a house, and thou shalt not dwell in it; thou shalt plant a vineyard, and shalt not gather the grapes of it.
005	DEU	028	031	Thy calf [shall be] slain before thee, and thou shalt not eat of it; thine ass shall be violently taken away from thee, and shall not be restored to thee: thy sheep shall be given to thine enemies, and thou shalt have no helper.
005	DEU	028	032	Thy sons and thy daughters shall be given to another nation, and thine eyes wasting away shall look for them: thine hand shall have no strength.
005	DEU	028	033	A nation which thou knowest not shall eat the produce of thy land, and all thy labours; and thou shalt be injured and crushed always.
005	DEU	028	034	And thou shalt be distracted, because of the sights of thine eyes which thou shalt see.
005	DEU	028	035	The Lord smite thee with an evil sore, on the knees and the legs, so that thou shalt not be able to be healed from the sole of thy foot to the crown of thy head.
005	DEU	028	036	The Lord carry away thee and thy princes, whom thou shalt set over thee, to a nation which neither thou nor thy fathers know; and thou shalt there serve other gods, wood and stone.
005	DEU	028	037	An thou shalt be there for a wonder, and a parable, and a tale, among all the nations, to which the Lord thy God shall carry thee away.
005	DEU	028	038	Thou shalt carry forth much seed into the field, and thou shalt bring in little, because the locust shall devour it.
005	DEU	028	039	Thou shalt plant a vineyard, and dress it, and shalt not drink the wine, neither shalt thou delight thyself with it, because the worm shall devour it.
005	DEU	028	040	Thou shalt have olive trees in all thy borders, and thou shalt not anoint thee with oil, because thine olive shall utterly cast [its fruit].
005	DEU	028	041	Thou shalt beget sons and daughters, and they shall not be [thine], for they shall depart into captivity.
005	DEU	028	042	All thy trees and the fruits of thy land shall the blight consume.
005	DEU	028	043	The stranger that is within thee shall get up very high, and thou shalt come down very low.
005	DEU	028	044	He shall lend to thee, and thou shalt not lend to him: he shall be the head, and thou shalt be the tail.
005	DEU	028	045	And all these curses shall come upon thee, and shall pursue thee, and shall overtake thee, until he shall have consumed thee, and until he shall have destroyed thee; because thou didst not hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God, to keep his commands, and his ordinances which he has commanded thee.
005	DEU	028	046	And [these things] shall be signs in thee, and wonders among thy seed for ever;
005	DEU	028	047	because thou didst not serve the Lord thy God with gladness and a good heart, because of the abundance of all things.
005	DEU	028	048	And thou shalt serve thine enemies, which the Lord will send forth against thee, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in the want of all things; and thou shalt wear upon thy neck a yoke of iron until he shall have destroyed thee.
005	DEU	028	049	The Lord shall bring upon thee a nation from the extremity of the earth, like the swift flying of an eagle, a nation whose voice thou shalt not understand;
005	DEU	028	050	a nation bold in countenance, which shall not respect the person of the aged and shall not pity the young.
005	DEU	028	051	And it shall eat up the young of thy cattle, and the fruits of thy land, so as not to leave to thee corn, wine, oil, the herds of thine oxen, and the flocks of thy sheep, until it shall have destroyed thee;
005	DEU	028	052	and have utterly crushed thee in thy cities, until the high and strong walls be destroyed, in which thou trustest, in all thy land; and it shall afflict thee in thy cities, which he has given to thee.
005	DEU	028	053	And thou shalt eat the fruit of thy body, the flesh of thy sons and of thy daughters, all that he has given thee, in thy straitness and thy affliction, with which thine enemy shall afflict thee.
005	DEU	028	054	He that is tender and very delicate within thee shall look with an evil eye upon his brother, and the wife in his bosom, and the children that are left, which may have been left to him;
005	DEU	028	055	so as [not] to give to one of them of the flesh of his children, whom he shall eat, because of his having nothing left him in thy straitness, and in thy affliction, with which thine enemies shall afflict thee in all thy cities.
005	DEU	028	056	And she that is tender and delicate among you, whose foot has not assayed to go upon the earth for delicacy and tenderness, shall look with an evil eye on her husband in her bosom, and her son and her daughter,
005	DEU	028	057	and her offspring that comes out between her feet, and the child which she shall bear; for she shall eat them because of the want of all things, secretly in thy straitness, and in thy affliction, with which thine enemy shall afflict thee in thy cities.
005	DEU	028	058	If thou wilt not hearken to do all the words of this law, which have been written in this book, to fear this glorious and wonderful name, the Lord thy God;
005	DEU	028	059	then the Lord shall magnify thy plagues, and the plagues of thy seed, great and wonderful plagues, and evil and abiding diseases.
005	DEU	028	060	And he shall bring upon thee all the evil pain of Egypt, of which thou wast afraid, and they shall cleave to thee.
005	DEU	028	061	And the Lord shall bring upon thee every sickness, and every plague that is not written, and every one that is written in the book of this law, until he shall have destroyed thee.
005	DEU	028	062	And ye shall be left few in number, whereas ye were as the stars of the sky in multitude; because thou didst not hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God.
005	DEU	028	063	And it shall come to pass that as the Lord rejoiced over you to do you good, and to multiply you, so the Lord will rejoice over you to destroy you; and ye shall be quickly removed from the land, into which ye go to inherit it.
005	DEU	028	064	And the Lord thy God shall scatter thee among all nations, from one end of the earth to the other; and thou shalt there serve other gods, wood and stone, which thou hast not known, nor thy fathers.
005	DEU	028	065	Moreover among those nations he will not give thee quiet, neither by any means shall the sole of thy foot have rest; and the Lord shall give thee there another and a misgiving heart, and failing eyes, and a wasting soul.
005	DEU	028	066	And thy life shall be in suspense before thine eyes; and thou shalt be afraid by day and by night, and thou shalt have no assurance of thy life.
005	DEU	028	067	In the morning thou shalt say, Would it were evening! and in the evening thou shalt say, Would it were morning! for the fear of thine heart with which thou shalt fear, and for the sights of thine eyes which thou shalt see.
005	DEU	028	068	And the Lord shall bring thee back to Egypt in ships, by the way of which I said, Thou shalt not see it again; and ye shall be sold there to your enemies for bondmen and bondwomen, and none shall buy you.
005	DEU	029	001	These [are] the words of the covenant, which the Lord commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab, besides the covenant which he made with them in Choreb.
005	DEU	029	002	And Moses called all the sons of Israel and said to them, Ye have seen all things that the Lord did in the land of Egypt before you to Pharao and his servants, and all his land;
005	DEU	029	003	the great temptations which thine eyes have seen, the signs, and those great wonders.
005	DEU	029	004	Yet the Lord God has not given you a heart to know, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, until this day.
005	DEU	029	005	And he led you forty years in the wilderness; your garments did not grow old, and your sandals were not worn away off your feet.
005	DEU	029	006	Ye did not eat bread, ye did not drink wine or strong drink, that ye might know that I [am] the Lord your God.
005	DEU	029	007	And ye came as far as this place; and there came forth Seon king of Esebon, and Og king of Basan, to meet us in war.
005	DEU	029	008	And we smote them and took their land, and I gave it for an inheritance to Ruben and Gad, and to the half-tribe of Manasse.
005	DEU	029	009	And ye shall take heed to do all the words of this covenant, that ye may understand all things that ye shall do.
005	DEU	029	010	Ye all stand to-day before the Lord your God, the heads of your tribes, and your elders, and your judges, and your officers, every man of Israel,
005	DEU	029	011	your wives, and your children, and the stranger who is in the midst of your camp, from your hewer of wood even to your drawer of water,
005	DEU	029	012	that thou shouldest enter into the covenant of the Lord thy God and into his oaths, as many as the Lord thy God appoints thee this day;
005	DEU	029	013	that he may appoint thee to himself for a people, and he shall be thy God, as he said to thee, and as he sware to thy fathers, Abraam, and Isaac, and Jacob.
005	DEU	029	014	And I do not appoint to you alone this covenant and this oath;
005	DEU	029	015	but to those also who are here with you to-day before the Lord your God, and to those who are not here with you to-day.
005	DEU	029	016	For ye know how we dwelt in the land of Egypt, how we came through the midst of the nations through whom ye came.
005	DEU	029	017	And ye beheld their abominations, and their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which are among them.
005	DEU	029	018	Lest there be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe, whose heart has turned aside from the Lord your God, having gone to serve the gods of these nations; lest there be in you a root springing up with gall and bitterness.
005	DEU	029	019	And it shall be if one shall hear the words of this curse, and shall flatter himself in his heart, saying, Let good happen to me, for I will walk in the error of my heart, lest the sinner destroy the guiltless with [him]:
005	DEU	029	020	God shall by no means be willing to pardon him, but then the wrath of the Lord and his jealousy shall flame out against that man; and all the curses of this covenant shall attach themselves to him, which are written in this book, and the Lord shall blot out his name from under heaven.
005	DEU	029	021	And the Lord shall separate that man for evil of all the children of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant that are written in the book of this law.
005	DEU	029	022	And another generation shall say—even your sons who shall rise up after you, and the stranger who shall come from a land afar off, and shall see the plagues of that land and their diseases, which the Lord has sent upon it,
005	DEU	029	023	brimstone and burning salt, (the whole land shall not be sown, neither shall any green thing spring, nor rise upon it, as Sodom and Gomorrha were overthrown, Adama and Seboim, which the Lord overthrew in his wrath and anger:)—
005	DEU	029	024	and all the nations shall say, Why has the Lord done thus to this land? what [is] this great fierceness of anger?
005	DEU	029	025	And [men] shall say, Because they forsook the covenant of the Lord God of their fathers, the things which he appointed to their fathers, when he brought them out of the land of Egypt:
005	DEU	029	026	and they went and served other gods, which they knew not, neither did he assign [them] to them.
005	DEU	029	027	And the Lord was exceedingly angry with that land to bring upon it according to all the curses which are written in the book of this law.
005	DEU	029	028	And the Lord removed them from their land in anger, and wrath, and very great indignation, and cast them out into another land as at present.
005	DEU	029	029	The secret things [belong] to the Lord our God, but the things that are revealed [belong] to us and to our children for ever, to do all the words of this law.
005	DEU	030	001	And it shall come to pass when all these things shall have come upon thee, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before thy face, and thou shalt call [them] to mind among all the nations, wherein the Lord shall have scattered thee,
005	DEU	030	002	and shalt return to the Lord thy God, and shalt hearken to his voice, according to all things which I charge thee this day, with all thy heart, and with all thy soul;
005	DEU	030	003	then the Lord shall heal thine iniquities, and shall pity thee, and shall again gather thee out from all the nations, among which the Lord has scattered thee.
005	DEU	030	004	If thy dispersion be from one end of heaven to the other, thence will the Lord thy God gather thee, and thence will the Lord thy God take thee.
005	DEU	030	005	And the Lord thy God shall bring thee in from thence into the land which thy fathers have inherited, and thou shalt inherit it; and he will do thee good, and multiply thee above thy fathers.
005	DEU	030	006	And the Lord shall purge thy heart, and the heart of thy seed, to love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, that thou mayest live.
005	DEU	030	007	And the Lord thy God will put these curses upon thine enemies, and upon those that hate thee, who have persecuted thee.
005	DEU	030	008	And thou shalt return and hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God, and shall keep his commands, all that I charge thee this day.
005	DEU	030	009	And the Lord thy God shall bless thee in every work of thine hands, in the offspring of thy body, and in the offspring of thy cattle, and in the fruits of thy land, because the Lord thy God will again rejoice over thee for good, as he rejoiced over thy fathers:
005	DEU	030	010	if thou wilt hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God, to keep his commandments, and his ordinances, and his judgments written in the book of this law, if thou turn to the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul.
005	DEU	030	011	For this command which I give thee this day is not grievous, neither is it far from thee.
005	DEU	030	012	It is not in heaven above, [as if there were one] saying, Who shall go up for us into heaven, and shall take it for us, and we will hear and do it?
005	DEU	030	013	Neither is it beyond the sea, saying, Who will go over for us to the other side of the sea, and take it for us, and make it audible to us, and we will do it?
005	DEU	030	014	The word is very near thee, in thy mouth, and in thine heart, and in thine hands to do it.
005	DEU	030	015	Behold, I have set before thee this day life and death, good and evil.
005	DEU	030	016	If thou wilt hearken to the commands of the Lord thy God, which I command thee this day, to love the Lord thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his ordinances, and his judgments; then ye shall live, and shall be many in number, and the Lord thy God shall bless thee in all the land into which thou goest to inherit it.
005	DEU	030	017	But if thy heart change, and thou wilt not hearken, and thou shalt go astray and worship other gods, and serve them,
005	DEU	030	018	I declare to you this day, that ye shall utterly perish, and ye shall by no means live long upon the land, into which ye go over Jordan to inherit it.
005	DEU	030	019	I call both heaven and earth to witness this day against you, I have set before you life and death, the blessing and the curse: choose thou life, that thou and thy seed may live;
005	DEU	030	020	to love the Lord thy God, to hearken to his voice, and cleave to him; for this [is] thy life, and the length of thy days, that thou shouldest dwell upon the land, which the Lord sware to thy fathers, Abraam, and Isaac, and Jacob, to give to them.
005	DEU	031	001	And Moses finished speaking all these words to all the children of Israel;
005	DEU	031	002	and said to them, I am this day a hundred and twenty years [old]; I shall not be able any longer to come in or go out; and the Lord said to me, Thou shalt not go over this Jordan.
005	DEU	031	003	The Lord thy God who goes before thee, he shall destroy these nations before thee, and thou shalt inherit them: and [it shall be] Joshua that goes before thy face, as the Lord has spoken.
005	DEU	031	004	And the Lord thy God shall do to them as he did to Seon and Og the two kings of the Amorites, who were beyond Jordan, and to their land, as he destroyed them.
005	DEU	031	005	And the Lord has delivered them to you; and ye shall do to them, as I charged you.
005	DEU	031	006	Be courageous and strong, fear not, neither be cowardly neither be afraid before them; for [it is] the Lord your God that advances with you in the midst of you, neither will he by any means forsake thee, nor desert thee.
005	DEU	031	007	And Moses called Joshua, and said to him before all Israel, Be courageous and strong; for thou shalt go in before this people into the land which the Lord sware to your fathers to give to them, and thou shalt give it to them for an inheritance.
005	DEU	031	008	And the Lord that goes with thee shall not forsake thee nor abandon thee; fear not, neither be afraid.
005	DEU	031	009	And Moses wrote the words of this law in a book, and gave it to the priests the sons of Levi who bear the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and to the elders of the sons of Israel.
005	DEU	031	010	And Moses charged them in that day, saying, After seven years, in the time of the year of release, in the feast of tabernacles,
005	DEU	031	011	when all Israel come together to appear before the Lord your God, in the place which the Lord shall choose, ye shall read this law before all Israel in their ears,
005	DEU	031	012	having assembled the people, the men, and the women, and the children, and the stranger that is in your cities, that they may hear, and that they may learn to fear the Lord your God; and they shall hearken to do all the words of this law.
005	DEU	031	013	And their sons who have not known shall hear, and shall learn to fear the Lord thy God all the days that they live upon the land, into which ye go over Jordan to inherit it.
005	DEU	031	014	And the Lord said to Moses, Behold, the days of thy death are at hand; call Joshua, and stand ye by the doors of the tabernacle of testimony, and I will give him a charge. And Moses and Joshua went to the tabernacle of testimony, and stood by the doors of the tabernacle of testimony.
005	DEU	031	015	And the Lord descended in a cloud, and stood by the doors of the tabernacle of testimony; and the pillar of the cloud stood by the doors of the tabernacle of testimony.
005	DEU	031	016	And the Lord said to Moses, Behold, thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, and this people will arise and go a whoring after the strange gods of the land, into which they are entering: and they will forsake me, and break my covenant, which I made with them.
005	DEU	031	017	And I will be very angry with them in that day, and I will leave them and turn my face away from them, and they shall be devoured; and many evils and afflictions shall come upon them; and they shall say in that day, Because the Lord my God is not with me, these evils have come upon me.
005	DEU	031	018	And I will surely turn away my face from them in that day, because of all their evil doings which they have done, because they turned aside after strange gods.
005	DEU	031	019	And now write the words of this song, and teach it to the children of Israel, and ye shall put it into their mouth, that this song may witness for me among the children of Israel to their face.
005	DEU	031	020	For I will bring them into the good land, which I sware to their fathers, to give to them a land flowing with milk and honey: and they shall eat and be filled and satisfy [themselves]; then will they turn aside after other gods, and serve them, and they will provoke me, and break my covenant.
005	DEU	031	021	And this song shall stand up to witness against them; for they shall not forget it out of their mouth, or out of the mouth of their seed; for I know their wickedness, what they are doing here this day, before I have brought them into the good land, which I sware to their fathers.
005	DEU	031	022	And Moses wrote this song in that day, and taught it to the children of Israel.
005	DEU	031	023	And he charged Joshua, and said, Be courageous and strong, for thou shalt bring the sons of Israel into the land, which the Lord sware to them, and he shall be with thee.
005	DEU	031	024	And when Moses finished writing all the words of this law in a book, even to the end,
005	DEU	031	025	then he charged the Levites who bear the ark of the covenant of the Lord, saying,
005	DEU	031	026	Take the book of this law, and ye shall put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God; and it shall be there among you for a testimony.
005	DEU	031	027	For I know thy provocation, and thy stiff neck; for yet during my life with you at this day, ye have been provoking in your conduct toward God: how shall ye not also be so after my death?
005	DEU	031	028	Gather together to me the heads of your tribes, and your elders, and your judges, and your officers, that I may speak in their ears all these words; and I call both heaven and earth to witness against them.
005	DEU	031	029	For I know that after my death ye will utterly transgress, and turn aside out of the way which I have commanded you; and evils shall come upon you in the latter days, because ye will do evil before the Lord, to provoke him to anger by the works of your hands. And Moses spoke all the words of this song even to the end, in the ears of the whole assembly.
005	DEU	032	001	Attend, O heaven, and I will speak; and let the earth hear the words out of my mouth.
005	DEU	032	002	Let my speech be looked for as the rain, and my words come down as dew, as the shower upon the herbage, and as snow upon the grass.
005	DEU	032	003	For I have called on the name of the Lord: assign ye greatness to our God.
005	DEU	032	004	[As for God], his works [are] true, and all his ways [are] judgment: God [is] faithful, and there is no unrighteousness [in him]; just and holy [is] the Lord.
005	DEU	032	005	They have sinned, not [pleasing] him; spotted children, a froward and perverse generation.
005	DEU	032	006	Do ye thus recompense the Lord? [is the] people thus foolish and unwise? did not he himself thy father purchase thee, and make thee, and form thee?
005	DEU	032	007	Remember the days of old, consider the years for past ages: ask thy father, and he shall relate to thee, thine elders, and they shall tell thee.
005	DEU	032	008	When the Most High divided the nations, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the nations according to the number of the angels of God.
005	DEU	032	009	And his people Jacob became the portion of the Lord, Israel was the line of his inheritance.
005	DEU	032	010	He maintained him in the wilderness, in burning thirst and a dry land: he led him about and instructed him, and kept him as the apple of an eye.
005	DEU	032	011	As an eagle would watch over his brood, and yearns over his young, receives them having spread his wings, and takes them up on his back:
005	DEU	032	012	the Lord alone led them, there was no strange god with them.
005	DEU	032	013	He brought them up on the strength of the land; he fed them with the fruits of the fields; they sucked honey out of the rock, and oil out of the solid rock.
005	DEU	032	014	Butter of cows, and milk of sheep, with the fat of lambs and rams, of calves and kids, with fat of kidneys of wheat; and he drank wine, the blood of the grape.
005	DEU	032	015	So Jacob ate and was filled, and the beloved one kicked; he grew fat, he became thick and broad: then he forsook the God that made him, and departed from God his Saviour.
005	DEU	032	016	They provoked me to anger with strange gods; with their abominations they bitterly angered me.
005	DEU	032	017	They sacrificed to devils, and not to God; to gods whom they knew not: new and fresh [gods] came in, whom their fathers knew not.
005	DEU	032	018	Thou hast forsaken God that begot thee, and forgotten God who feeds thee.
005	DEU	032	019	And the Lord saw, and was jealous; and was provoked by the anger of his sons and daughters,
005	DEU	032	020	and said, I will turn away my face from them, and will show what shall happen to them in the last days; for it is a perverse generation, sons in whom is no faith.
005	DEU	032	021	They have provoked me to jealousy with [that which is] not God, they have exasperated me with their idols; and I will provoke them to jealousy with them that are no nation, I will anger them with a nation void of understanding.
005	DEU	032	022	For a fire has been kindled out of my wrath, it shall burn to hell below; it shall devour the land, and the fruits of it; it shall set on fire the foundations of the mountains.
005	DEU	032	023	I will gather evils upon them, and will fight with my weapons against them.
005	DEU	032	024	[They shall be] consumed with hunger and the devouring of birds, and there shall be irremediable destruction: I will send forth against them the teeth of wild beasts, with the rage of [serpents] creeping on the ground.
005	DEU	032	025	Without, the sword shall bereave them of children, and terror [shall issue] out of the secret chambers; the young man shall perish with the virgin, the suckling with him who has grown old.
005	DEU	032	026	I said, I will scatter them, and I will cause their memorial to cease from among men.
005	DEU	032	027	Were it not for the wrath of the enemy, lest they should live long, lest their enemies should combine against them; lest they should say, Our own high arm, and not the Lord, has done all these things.
005	DEU	032	028	It is a nation that has lost counsel, neither is there understanding in them.
005	DEU	032	029	They had not sense to understand: let them reserve these things against the time to come.
005	DEU	032	030	How should one pursue a thousand, and two rout tens of thousands, if God had not sold them, and the Lord delivered them up?
005	DEU	032	031	For their gods are not as our God, but our enemies [are] void of understanding.
005	DEU	032	032	For their vine [is] of the vine of Sodom, and their vine-branch of Gomorrha: their grape [is] a grape of gall, their cluster [is] one of bitterness.
005	DEU	032	033	Their wine [is] the rage of serpents, and the incurable rage of asps.
005	DEU	032	034	Lo! are not these things stored up by me, and sealed among my treasures?
005	DEU	032	035	In the day of vengeance I will recompense, whensoever their foot shall be tripped up; for the day of their destruction [is] near to them, and the judgments at hand are close upon you.
005	DEU	032	036	For the Lord shall judge his people, and shall be comforted over his servants; for he saw that they were utterly weakened, and failed in the hostile invasion, and were become feeble:
005	DEU	032	037	and the Lord said, Where are their gods on whom they trusted?
005	DEU	032	038	the fat of whose sacrifices ye ate, and ye drank the wine of their drink-offerings? let them arise and help you, and be your protectors.
005	DEU	032	039	Behold, behold that I am [he], and there is no god beside me: I kill, and I will make to live: I will smite, and I will heal; and there is none who shall deliver out of my hands.
005	DEU	032	040	For I will lift up my hand to heaven, and swear by my right hand, and I will say, I live for ever.
005	DEU	032	041	For I will sharpen my sword like lightning, and my hand shall take hold of judgment; and I will render judgment to my enemies, and will recompense them that hate me.
005	DEU	032	042	I will make my weapons drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh, [it shall glut itself] with the blood of the wounded, and from the captivity of the heads of [their] enemies that rule over them.
005	DEU	032	043	Rejoice, ye heavens, with him, and let all the angels of God worship him; rejoice ye Gentiles, with his people, and let all the sons of God strengthen themselves in him; for he will avenge the blood of his sons, and he will render vengeance, and recompense justice to his enemies, and will reward them that hate him; and the Lord shall purge the land of his people.
005	DEU	032	044	And Moses wrote this song in that day, and taught it to the children of Israel; and Moses went in and spoke all the words of this law in the ears of the people, he and Joshua the [son] of Naue.
005	DEU	032	045	And Moses finished speaking to all Israel.
005	DEU	032	046	And he said to them, Take heed with your heart to all these words, which I testify to you this day, which ye shall command your sons, to observe and do all the words of this law.
005	DEU	032	047	For this [is] no vain word to you; for it [is] your life, and because of this word ye shall live long upon the land, into which ye go over Jordan to inherit it.
005	DEU	032	048	And the Lord spoke to Moses in this day, saying,
005	DEU	032	049	Go up to the mount Abarim, this mountain Nabau which is in the land of Moab over against Jericho, and behold the land of Chanaan, which I give to the sons of Israel:
005	DEU	032	050	and die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be added to thy people; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Or, and was added to his people.
005	DEU	032	051	Because ye disobeyed my word among the children of Israel, at the waters of strife of Cades in the wilderness of Sin; because ye sanctified me not among the sons of Israel.
005	DEU	032	052	Thou shalt see the land before [thee], but thou shalt not enter into it.
005	DEU	033	001	And this [is] the blessing with which Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death.
005	DEU	033	002	And he said, The Lord is come from Sina, and has appeared from Seir to us, and has hasted out of the mount of Pharan, with the ten thousands of Cades; on his right hand [were] his angels with him.
005	DEU	033	003	And he spared his people, and all his sanctified ones [are] under thy hands; and they are under thee; and he received of his words
005	DEU	033	004	the law which Moses charged us, an inheritance to the assemblies of Jacob.
005	DEU	033	005	And he shall be prince with the beloved one, when the princes of the people are gathered together with the tribes of Israel.
005	DEU	033	006	Let Ruben live, and not die; and let him be many in number.
005	DEU	033	007	And this [is the blessing] of Juda; Hear, Lord, the voice of Juda, and do thou visit his people: his hands shall contend for him, and thou shalt be a help from his enemies.
005	DEU	033	008	And to Levi he said, Give to Levi his manifestations, and his truth to the holy man, whom they tempted in the temptation; they reviled him at the water of strife.
005	DEU	033	009	Who says to his father and mother, I have not seen thee; and he knew not his brethren, and he refused to know his sons: he kept thine oracles, and observed thy covenant.
005	DEU	033	010	They shall declare thine ordinances to Jacob, and thy law to Israel: they shall place incense in [the time of] thy wrath continually upon thine altar.
005	DEU	033	011	Bless, Lord, his strength, and accept the works of his hands; break the loins of his enemies that have risen up against him, and let not them that hate him rise up.
005	DEU	033	012	And to Benjamin he said, The beloved of the Lord shall dwell in confidence, and God overshadows him always, and he rested between his shoulders.
005	DEU	033	013	And to Joseph he said, His land [is] of the blessing of the Lord, of the seasons of sky and dew, and of the deeps of wells below,
005	DEU	033	014	and of the fruits of the changes of the sun in season, and of the produce of the months,
005	DEU	033	015	from the top of the ancient mountains, and from the top of the everlasting hills,
005	DEU	033	016	and of the fullness of the land in season: and let the things pleasing to him that dwelt in the bush come on the head of Joseph, and on the crown [of him who was] glorified above his brethren.
005	DEU	033	017	His beauty [is as] the firstling of his bull, his horns [are] the horns of a unicorn; with them he shall thrust the nations at once, even from the end of the earth: these [are] the ten thousands of Ephraim, and these [are] the thousands of Manasse.
005	DEU	033	018	And to Zabulon he said, Rejoice, Zabulon, in thy going out, and Issachar in his tents.
005	DEU	033	019	They shall utterly destroy the nations, and ye shall call [men] there, and there offer the sacrifice of righteousness; for the wealth of the sea shall suckle thee, and so shall the marts of them that dwell by the sea-coast.
005	DEU	033	020	And to Gad he said, Blessed [be] he that enlarges Gad: as a lion he rested, having broken the arm and the ruler.
005	DEU	033	021	And he saw his first-fruits, that there the land of the princes gathered with the chiefs of the people was divided; the Lord wrought righteousness, and his judgment with Israel.
005	DEU	033	022	And to Dan he said, Dan [is] a lion's whelp, and shall leap out of Basan.
005	DEU	033	023	And to Nephthali he said, Nephthali [has] the fulness of good things; and let him be filled with blessing from the Lord: he shall inherit the west and the south.
005	DEU	033	024	And to Aser he said, Aser [is] blessed with children; and he shall be acceptable to his brethren: he shall dip his foot in oil.
005	DEU	033	025	His sandal shall be iron and brass; as thy days, so [shall be] thy strength.
005	DEU	033	026	There is not [any such] as the God of the beloved; he who rides upon the heaven [is] thy helper, and the magnificent One of the firmament.
005	DEU	033	027	And the rule of God shall protect thee, and [that] under the strength of the everlasting arms; and he shall cast forth the enemy from before thy face, saying, Perish.
005	DEU	033	028	And Israel shall dwell in confidence alone on the land of Jacob, with corn and wine; and the sky [shall be] misty with dew upon thee.
005	DEU	033	029	Blessed [art] thou, O Israel; who [is] like to thee, O people saved by the Lord? thy helper shall hold his shield over thee, and [his] sword [is] thy boast; and thine enemies shall speak falsely to thee, and thou shalt tread upon their neck.
005	DEU	034	001	And Moses went up from Araboth Moab to the mount of Nabau, to the top of Phasga, which is before Jericho; and the Lord shewed him all the mount of Galaad to Dan, and all the land of Nephthali,
005	DEU	034	002	and all the land of Ephraim and Manasse, and all the land of Juda to the farthest sea;
005	DEU	034	003	and the wilderness, and the country round about Jericho, the city of palm-trees, to Segor.
005	DEU	034	004	And the Lord said to Moses, This [is] the land of which I sware to Abraam, and Isaac, and Jacob, saying, To your seed will I give it: and I have shewed it to thine eyes, but thou shalt not go in thither.
005	DEU	034	005	So Moses the servant of the Lord died in the land of Moab by the word of the Lord.
005	DEU	034	006	And they buried him in Gai near the house of Phogor; and no one has seen his sepulchre to this day.
005	DEU	034	007	And Moses was a hundred and twenty years old at his death; his eyes were not dimmed, nor were his natural powers destroyed.
005	DEU	034	008	And the children of Israel wept for Moses in Araboth of Moab at Jordan near Jericho thirty days; and the days of the sad mourning for Moses were completed.
005	DEU	034	009	And Joshua the son of Naue was filled with the spirit of knowledge, for Moses had laid his hands upon him; and the children of Israel hearkened to him; and they did as the Lord commanded Moses.
005	DEU	034	010	And there rose up no more a prophet in Israel like Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face,
005	DEU	034	011	in all the signs and wonders, which the Lord sent him to work in Egypt on Pharao, and his servants, and all his land;
005	DEU	034	012	the great wonders, and the mighty hand which Moses displayed before all Israel.

# BOOK	006	JOS	Joshua	Joshua
006	JOS	001	001	And it came to pass after the death of Moses, that the Lord spoke to Joshua the son of Naue, the minister of Moses, saying,
006	JOS	001	002	Moses my servant is dead; now then arise, go over Jordan, thou and all this people, into the land, which I give them.
006	JOS	001	003	Every spot on which ye shall tread I will give it to you, as I said to Moses.
006	JOS	001	004	The wilderness and Antilibanus, as far as the great river, the river Euphrates, and as far as the extremity of the sea; your costs shall be from the setting of the sun.
006	JOS	001	005	Not a man shall stand against you all the days of thy life; and as I was with Moses, so will I also be with thee, and I will not fail thee, or neglect thee.
006	JOS	001	006	Be strong and 'quit thyself like a man, for thou shalt divide the land to this people, which I sware to give to your fathers.
006	JOS	001	007	Be strong, therefore, and quit thyself like a man, to observe and do as Moses my servant commanded thee; and thou shalt not turn therefrom to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest be wise in whatsoever thou mayest do.
006	JOS	001	008	And the book of this law shall not depart out of thy mouth, and thou shalt meditate in it day and night, that thou mayest know how to do all the things that are written [in it]; then shalt thou prosper, and make thy ways prosperous, and then shalt thou be wise.
006	JOS	001	009	Lo! I have commanded thee; be strong and courageous, be not cowardly nor fearful, for the Lord thy God is with thee in all places whither thou goest.
006	JOS	001	010	And Joshua commanded the scribes of the people, saying,
006	JOS	001	011	Go into the midst of the camp of the people, and command the people, saying, Prepare provisions; for yet three days and ye shall go over this Jordan, entering in to take possession of the land, which the Lord God of your fathers gives to you.
006	JOS	001	012	And to Ruben, and to Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasse, Joshua said,
006	JOS	001	013	Remember the word which Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you, saying, the Lord your God has caused you to rest, and has given you this land.
006	JOS	001	014	Let your wives and your children and your cattle dwell in the land, which he has given you; and ye shall go over well armed before your brethren, every one of you who is strong; and ye shall fight on their side;
006	JOS	001	015	until the Lord your God shall have given your brethren rest, as also to you, and they also shall have inherited the land, which the Lord your God gives them; then ye shall depart each one to his inheritance, which Moses gave you beyond Jordan eastward.
006	JOS	001	016	And they answered Joshua and said, We will do all things which thou commandest us, and we will go to every place whither thou shalt send us.
006	JOS	001	017	Whereinsoever we hearkened to Moses we will hearken to thee; only let the Lord our God be with thee, as he was with Moses.
006	JOS	001	018	And whosoever shall disobey thee, and whosoever shall not hearken to thy words as thou shalt command him, let him die; but be thou strong and courageous.
006	JOS	002	001	And Joshua the son of Naue sent out of Sattin two young men to spy [the land], saying, Go up and view the land and Jericho: and the two young men went and entered into Jericho; and they entered into the house of a harlot, whose name [was] Raab, and lodged there.
006	JOS	002	002	An it was reported to the king of Jericho, saying, Men of the sons of Israel have come in hither to spy the land.
006	JOS	002	003	And the king of Jericho sent and spoke to Raab, saying, Bring out the men that entered into thine house this night; for they are come to spy out the land.
006	JOS	002	004	And the woman took the two men and hid them; and she spoke to the messengers, saying, The men came in to me,
006	JOS	002	005	but when the gate was shut in the evening, the men went out; I know not whither they are gone: follow after them, if ye may overtake them.
006	JOS	002	006	But she [had] brought them up upon the house, and hid them in the flax-stalks that were spread by her on the house.
006	JOS	002	007	And the men followed after them in the way to Jordan to the fords; and the gate was shut.
006	JOS	002	008	And it came to pass when the men who pursued after them were gone forth, and before the spies had lain down to sleep, that she came up to them on the top of the house;
006	JOS	002	009	and she said to them, I know that the Lord has given you the land; for the fear of you has fallen upon us.
006	JOS	002	010	For we have heard that the Lord God dried up the Red Sea before you, when ye came out of the land of Egypt, and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, who were beyond Jordan, to Seon and Og, whom ye utterly destroyed.
006	JOS	002	011	And when we heard it we were amazed in our heart, and there was no longer any spirit in any of us because of you, for the Lord your god [is] God in heaven above, and on the earth beneath.
006	JOS	002	012	And now swear to me by the Lord God; since I deal mercifully with you, so do ye also deal mercifully with the house of my father:
006	JOS	002	013	and save alive the house of my father, my mother, and my brethren, and all my house, and all that they have, and ye shall rescue my soul from death.
006	JOS	002	014	And the men said to her, Our life for yours [even] to death: and she said, When the Lord shall have delivered the city to you, ye shall deal mercifully and truly with me.
006	JOS	002	015	And she let them down by the window;
006	JOS	002	016	and she said to them, Depart into the hill-country, lest the pursuers meet you, and ye shall be hidden there three days until your pursuers return from after you, and afterwards ye shall depart on your way.
006	JOS	002	017	And the men said to her, We are clear of this thy oath.
006	JOS	002	018	Behold, we shall enter into a part of the city, and thou shalt set a sign; thou shalt bind this scarlet cord in the window, by which thou hast let us down, and thou shalt bring in to thyself, into thy house, thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all the family of thy father.
006	JOS	002	019	And it shall come to pass that whosoever shall go outside the door of thy house, his guilt shall be upon him, and we shall be quit of this thine oath; and we will be responsible for all that shall be found with thee in thy house.
006	JOS	002	020	But if any one should injure us, or betray these our matters, we shall be quit of this thine oath.
006	JOS	002	021	And she said to them, Let it be according to your word; and she sent them out, and they departed.
006	JOS	002	022	And they came to the hill-country, and remained there three days; and the pursuers searched all the roads, and found them not.
006	JOS	002	023	And the two young men returned, and came down out of the mountain; and they went over to Joshua the son of Naue, and told him all things that had happened to them.
006	JOS	002	024	And they said to Joshua, The Lord has delivered all the land into our power, and all the inhabitants of that land tremble because of us.
006	JOS	003	001	And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and departed from Sattin; and they came as far as Jordan, and lodged there before they crossed over.
006	JOS	003	002	And it came to pass after three days, [that] the scribes went through the camp;
006	JOS	003	003	and they charged the people, saying, When ye shall see the ark of the covenant of the Lord our God, and our priests and the Levites bearing it, ye shall depart from your places, and ye shall go after it.
006	JOS	003	004	But let there be a distance between you and it; ye shall stand as much as two thousand cubits [from it]. Do not draw nigh to it, that ye may know the way which ye are to go; for ye have not gone the way before.
006	JOS	003	005	And Joshua said to the people, Sanctify yourselves against to-morrow, for to-morrow the Lord will do wonders among you.
006	JOS	003	006	And Joshua said to the priests, Take up the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and go before the people: and the priests took up the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and went before the people.
006	JOS	003	007	And the Lord said to Joshua, This day do I begin to exalt thee before all the children of Israel, that they may know that as I was with Moses, so will I also be with thee.
006	JOS	003	008	And now charge the priests that bear the ark of the covenant, saying, As soon as ye shall enter on a part of the water of Jordan, then ye shall stand in Jordan.
006	JOS	003	009	And Joshua said to the children of Israel, Come hither, and hearken to the word of the Lord our God.
006	JOS	003	010	Hereby ye shall know that the living God [is] among you, and will utterly destroy from before our face the Chananite, and the Chettite and Pherezite, and the Evite, and the Amorite, and the Gergesite, and the Jebusite.
006	JOS	003	011	Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passes over Jordan.
006	JOS	003	012	Choose for yourselves twelve men of the sons of Israel, one of each tribe.
006	JOS	003	013	And it shall come to pass, when the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the covenant of the Lord of the whole earth rest in the water of Jordan, the water of Jordan [below] shall fail, and the water coming down from above shall stop.
006	JOS	003	014	And the people removed from their tents to cross over Jordan, and the priests bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord before the people.
006	JOS	003	015	And when the priests that bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord entered upon Jordan, and the feet of the priests that bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord were dipped in part of the water of Jordan; (now Jordan overflowed all its banks about the time of wheat harvest:)
006	JOS	003	016	then the waters that came down from above stopped; there stood one solid heap very far off, as far as the region of Kariathiarim, and the lower part came down to the sea of Araba, the salt sea, till it completely failed; and the people stood opposite Jericho.
006	JOS	003	017	And the priests that bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord stood on dry land in the midst of Jordan; and all the children of Israel went through on dry land, until all the people had completely gone over Jordan.
006	JOS	004	001	And when the people had completely passed over Jordan, the Lord spoke to Joshua, saying,
006	JOS	004	002	Take men from the people, one of each tribe,
006	JOS	004	003	and charge them; and ye shall take out of the midst of Jordan twelve fit stones, and having carried them across together with yourselves, place them in your camp, where ye shall encamp for the night.
006	JOS	004	004	And Joshua having called twelve men of distinction among the children of Israel, one of each tribe,
006	JOS	004	005	said to them, Advance before me in the presence of the Lord into the midst of Jordan, and each having taken up a stone from thence, let him carry it on his shoulders, according to the number of the twelve tribes of Israel:
006	JOS	004	006	that these may be to you continually for an appointed sign, that when thy son asks thee in future, saying, What are these stones to us?
006	JOS	004	007	then thou mayest explain to thy son, saying, The river Jordan was dried up from before the ark of the covenant of the Lord of the whole earth, when it passed it: and these stones shall be for a memorial for you for the children of Israel for ever.
006	JOS	004	008	And the children of Israel did so, as the Lord commanded Joshua; and they took up twelve stones out of the midst of Jordan, (as the Lord commanded Joshua, when the children of Israel had completely passed over,) and carried these stones with them into the camp, and laid them down there.
006	JOS	004	009	And Joshua set also other twelve stones in Jordan itself, in the place that was under the feet of the priests that bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord; and there they are to this day.
006	JOS	004	010	And the priests that bore the ark of the covenant stood in Jordan, until Joshua [had] finished all that the Lord commanded him to report to the people; and the people hasted and passed over.
006	JOS	004	011	And it came to pass when all the people had passed over, that the ark of the covenant of the Lord passed over, and the stones before them.
006	JOS	004	012	And the sons of Ruben, and the sons of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasse passed over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses commanded them.
006	JOS	004	013	Forty thousand armed for battle went over before the Lord to war, to the city of Jericho.
006	JOS	004	014	In that day the Lord magnified Joshua before all the people of Israel; and they feared him, as [they did] Moses, as long as he lived.
006	JOS	004	015	And the Lord spoke to Joshua, saying,
006	JOS	004	016	Charge the priests that bear the ark of the covenant of the testimony of the Lord, to go up out of Jordan.
006	JOS	004	017	And Joshua charged the priests, saying, Go up out of Jordan.
006	JOS	004	018	And it came to pass when the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord were gone up out of Jordan, and set their feet upon the land, [that] the water of Jordan returned impetuously to its place, and went as before over all its banks.
006	JOS	004	019	And the people went up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the first month; and the children of Israel encamped in Galgala in the region eastward from Jericho.
006	JOS	004	020	And Joshua set these twelve stones which he took out of Jordan, in Galgala,
006	JOS	004	021	saying, When your sons ask you, saying, What are these stones?
006	JOS	004	022	Tell your sons, that Israel went over this Jordan on dry land,
006	JOS	004	023	when the Lord our God had dried up the water of Jordan from before them, until they had passed over; as the Lord our God did to the Red Sea, which the Lord our God dried up from before us, until we passed over.
006	JOS	004	024	That all the nations of the earth might know, that the power of the Lord is mighty, and that ye might worship the Lord our God in every work.
006	JOS	005	001	And it came to pass when the kings of the Amorites who were beyond Jordan heard, and the kings of Phoenicia by the sea, that the Lord God had dried up the river Jordan from before the children of Israel when they passed over, that their hearts failed, and they were terror-stricken, and there was no sense in them because of the children of Israel.
006	JOS	005	002	And about this time the Lord said to Joshua, Make thee stone knives of sharp stone, and sit down and circumcise the children of Israel the second time.
006	JOS	005	003	And Joshua made sharp knives of stone, and circumcised the children of Israel at the place called the “Hill of Foreskins.”
006	JOS	005	004	And [this is] the way in which Joshua purified the children of Israel; as many as were born in the way, and as many as were uncircumcised of them that came out of Egypt,
006	JOS	005	005	all these Joshua circumcised; for forty and two years Israel wondered in the wilderness of Mabdaris—
006	JOS	005	006	Wherefore most of the fighting men that came out of the land of Egypt, were uncircumcised, who disobeyed the commands of God; concerning whom also he determined that they should not see the land, which the Lord sware to give to their fathers, [even] a land flowing with milk and honey.
006	JOS	005	007	And in their place he raised up their sons, whom Joshua circumcised, because they were uncircumcised, having been born by the way.
006	JOS	005	008	And when they had been circumcised they rested continuing there in the camp till they were healed.
006	JOS	005	009	And the Lord said to Joshua the son of Naue, On this day have I removed the reproach of Egypt from you: and he called the name of that place Galgala.
006	JOS	005	010	And the children of Israel kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at evening, to the westward of Jericho on the opposite side of the Jordan in the plain.
006	JOS	005	011	And they ate of the grain of the earth unleavened and new [corn].
006	JOS	005	012	In this day the manna failed, after they had eaten of the corn of the land, and the children of Israel no longer had manna: and they took the fruits of the land of the Phoenicians in that year.
006	JOS	005	013	And it came to pass when Joshua was in Jericho, that he looked up with his eyes and saw a man standing before him, and [there was] a drawn sword in his hand; and Joshua drew near and said to him, Art thou for us or on the side of our enemies?
006	JOS	005	014	And he said to him, I am now come, the chief captain of the host of the Lord. And Joshua fell on his face upon the earth, and said to him, Lord, what commandest thou thy servant?
006	JOS	005	015	And the captain of the Lord's host said to Joshua, Loose thy shoe off thy feet, for the place whereon thou now standest is holy.
006	JOS	006	001	Now Jericho was closely shut up and besieged, and none went out of it, and none came in.
006	JOS	006	002	And the Lord said to Joshua, Behold, I deliver Jericho into thy power, and its king in it, [and its] mighty men.
006	JOS	006	003	And do thou set the men of war round about it.
006	JOS	006	004	And it shall be [that] when ye shall sound with the trumpet, all the people shall shout together.
006	JOS	006	005	And when they have shouted, the walls of the city shall fall of themselves; and all the people shall enter, each one rushing direct into the city.
006	JOS	006	006	And Joshua the [son] of Naue went in to the priests, and spoke to them, saying,
006	JOS	006	007	And let seven priests having seven sacred trumpets proceed thus before the Lord, and let them sound loudly; and let the ark of the covenant of the Lord follow.
006	JOS	006	008	Charge the people to go round, and encompass the city; and let your men of war pass on armed before the Lord.
006	JOS	006	009	And let the men of war proceed before, and the priests bringing up the rear behind the ark of the covenant of the Lord [proceed] sounding the trumpets.
006	JOS	006	010	And Joshua commanded the people, saying, Cry not out, nor let any one hear your voice, until he himself declare to you the time to cry out, and then ye shall cry out.
006	JOS	006	011	And the ark of the covenant of God having gone round immediately returned into the camp, and lodged there.
006	JOS	006	012	And on the second day Joshua rose up in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the covenant of the Lord.
006	JOS	006	013	And the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets went on before the Lord; and afterwards the men of war went on, and the remainder of the multitude went after the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and the priests sounded with the trumpets.
006	JOS	006	014	And all the rest of the multitude compassed the city six times from within a short distance, and went back again into the camp; this they did six days.
006	JOS	006	015	And on the seventh day they rose up early, and compassed the city on that day seven times.
006	JOS	006	016	And it came to pass at the seventh circuit the priests blew the trumpets; and Joshua said to the children of Israel, Shout, for the Lord has given you the city.
006	JOS	006	017	And the city shall be devoted, it and all things that are in it, to the Lord of Hosts: only do ye save Raab the harlot, and all things in her house.
006	JOS	006	018	But keep yourselves strictly from the accursed thing, lest ye set your mind upon and take of the accursed thing, and ye make the camp of the children of Israel and accursed thing, and destroy us.
006	JOS	006	019	And all the silver, or gold, or brass, or iron, shall be holy to the Lord; it shall be carried into the treasury of the Lord.
006	JOS	006	020	And the priests sounded with the trumpets: and when the people heard the trumpets, all the people shouted at once with a loud and strong shout; and all the wall fell round about, and all the people went up into the city:
006	JOS	006	021	and Joshua devoted it to destruction, and all things that were in the city, man and woman, young man and old, and calf and ass, with the edge of the sword.
006	JOS	006	022	And Joshua said to the two young men who had acted a spies, Go into the house of the woman, and bring her out thence, and all that she has.
006	JOS	006	023	And the two young men who had spied out the city entered into the house of the woman, and brought out Raab the harlot, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and her kindred, and all that she had; and they set her without the camp of Israel.
006	JOS	006	024	And the city was burnt with fire with all things that were in it; only of the silver, and gold, and brass, and iron, they gave to be brought into the treasury of the Lord.
006	JOS	006	025	And Joshua saved alive Raab the harlot, and all the house of her father, and caused her to dwell in Israel until this day, because she hid the spies which Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.
006	JOS	006	026	And Joshua adjured [them] on that day before the Lord, saying, Cursed [be] the man who shall build that city: he shall lay the foundation of it in his first-born, and he shall set up the gates of it in his youngest son. And so did Hozan of Baethel; he laid the foundation in Abiron his first-born, and set up the gates of it in his youngest surviving son.
006	JOS	006	027	And the Lord was with Joshua, and his name was in all the land.
006	JOS	007	001	But the children of Israel committed a great trespass, and purloined [part] of the accursed thing; and Achar the son of Charmi, the son of Zambri, the son of Zara, of the tribe of Juda, took of the accursed thing; and the Lord was very angry with the children of Israel.
006	JOS	007	002	And Joshua sent men to Gai, which is by Baethel, saying, Spy out Gai: and the men went up and spied Gai.
006	JOS	007	003	And they returned to Joshua, and said to him, Let not all the people go up, but let about two or three thousand men go up and take the city by siege: carry not up thither the whole people, for [the enemy] are few.
006	JOS	007	004	And there went up about three thousand men, and they fled from before the men of Gai.
006	JOS	007	005	And the men of Gai slew of them to the number of thirty-six men, and they pursued them from the gate, and destroyed them from the steep hill; and the heart of the people was alarmed and became as water.
006	JOS	007	006	And Joshua tore his garments; and Joshua fell on the earth on his face before the Lord until evening, he and the elders of Israel; and they cast dust on their heads.
006	JOS	007	007	And Joshua said, I pray, Lord, wherefore has thy servant brought this people over Jordan to deliver them to the Amorite to destroy us? would we had remained and settled ourselves beyond Jordan.
006	JOS	007	008	And what shall I say since Israel has turned his back before his enemy?
006	JOS	007	009	And when the Chananite and all the inhabitants of the land hear it, they shall compass us round and destroy us from off the land: and what wilt thou do [for] thy great name?
006	JOS	007	010	And the Lord said to Joshua, Rise up; why hast thou fallen upon thy face?
006	JOS	007	011	The people has sinned, and transgressed the covenant which I made with them; they have stolen from the cursed thing, and put it into their store.
006	JOS	007	012	And the children of Israel will not be able to stand before their enemies; they will turn their back before their enemies, for they have become an accursed thing: I will not any longer be with you, unless ye remove the cursed thing from yourselves.
006	JOS	007	013	Rise, sanctify the people and tell them to sanctify themselves for the morrow: thus says the Lord God of Israel, The accursed thing is among you; ye shall not be able to stand before your enemies, until ye shall have removed the cursed thing from among you.
006	JOS	007	014	And ye shall all be gathered together by your tribes in the morning, and it shall come to pass that the tribe which the Lord shall shew, ye shall bring by families; and the family which the Lord shall shew, ye shall bring by households; and the household which the Lord shall shew, ye shall bring man by man.
006	JOS	007	015	And the man who shall be pointed out, shall be burnt with fire, and all that he has; because he has transgressed the covenant of the Lord, and has wrought wickedness in Israel.
006	JOS	007	016	And Joshua rose up early, and brought the people by their tribes; and the tribe of Juda was pointed out.
006	JOS	007	017	And it was brought by their families, and family of the Zaraites was pointed out.
006	JOS	007	018	And it was brought man by man, and Achar the son of Zambri the son of Zara was pointed out.
006	JOS	007	019	And Joshua said to Achar, Give glory this day to the Lord God of Israel, and make confession; and tell me what thou hast done, and hide it not from me.
006	JOS	007	020	And Achar answered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned against the Lord God of Israel: thus and thus have I done:
006	JOS	007	021	I saw in the spoil an embroidered mantle, and two hundred didrachms of silver, and one golden wedge of fifty didrachms, and I desired them and took them; and, behold, they are hid in my tent, and the silver is hid under them.
006	JOS	007	022	And Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent into the camp; and these things were hidden in his tent, and the silver under them.
006	JOS	007	023	And they brought them out of the tent, and brought them to Joshua and the elders of Israel, and they laid them before the Lord.
006	JOS	007	024	And Joshua took Achar the son of Zara, and brought him to the valley of Achor, and his sons, and his daughters, and his calves, and his asses, and all his sheep, and his tent, and all his property, and all the people [were] with him; and he brought them to Emec Achor.
006	JOS	007	025	And Joshua said to Achar, Why hast thou destroyed us? the Lord destroy thee as at this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones.
006	JOS	007	026	And they set up over him a great heap of stones; and the Lord ceased from his fierce anger. Therefore he called the place Emecachor until this day.
006	JOS	008	001	And the Lord said to Joshua, Fear not, nor be timorous: take with thee all the men of war, and arise, go up to Gai; behold, I have given into thy hands the king of Gai, and his land.
006	JOS	008	002	And thou shalt do to Gai, as thou didst to Jericho and its king; and thou shalt take to thyself the spoil of its cattle; set now for thyself an ambush for the city behind.
006	JOS	008	003	And Joshua and all the men of war rose to go up to Gai; and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men, and he sent them away by night.
006	JOS	008	004	And he charged them, saying, Do ye lie in ambush behind the city: do not go far from the city, and ye shall all be ready.
006	JOS	008	005	Land I and all with me will draw near to the city: and it shall come to pass when the inhabitants of Gai shall come forth to meet us, as before, that we will flee from before them.
006	JOS	008	006	And when they shall come out after us, we will draw them away from the city; and they will say, These men flee from before us, as also before.
006	JOS	008	007	And ye shall rise up out of the ambuscade, and go into the city.
006	JOS	008	008	Ye shall do according to this word, lo! I have commanded you.
006	JOS	008	009	And Joshua sent them, and they went to lie in ambush; and they lay between Baethel and Gai, westward of Gai.
006	JOS	008	010	And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and numbered the people; and he went up, he and the elders before the people to Gai.
006	JOS	008	011	And all the men of war went up with him, and they went forward and came over against the city eastward.
006	JOS	008	012	And the ambuscade [was] on the west side of the city.
006	JOS	008	014	And it came to pass when the king of Gai saw [it], he hasted and went out to meet them direct to the battle, he and all the people [that were] with him: and he knew not that there was an ambuscade [formed] against him behind the city.
006	JOS	008	015	And Joshua and Israel saw, and retreated from before them.
006	JOS	008	016	And they pursued after the children of Israel, and they themselves went to a distance from the city.
006	JOS	008	017	There was no one left in Gai who did not pursue after Israel; and they left the city open, and pursued after Israel.
006	JOS	008	018	And the Lord said to Joshua, Stretch forth thy hand with the spear that is in thy hand toward the city, for I have delivered it into thy hands; and the liers in wait shall rise up quickly out of their place.
006	JOS	008	019	And Joshua stretched out his hand [and] his spear toward the city, and the ambuscade rose up quickly out of their place; and they came forth when he stretched out his hand; and they entered into the city, and took it; and they hasted and burnt the city with fire.
006	JOS	008	020	And when the inhabitants of Gai looked round behind them, then they saw the smoke going up out of the city to heaven, and they were no longer able to flee this way or that way.
006	JOS	008	021	And Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambuscade had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city went up to heaven; and they turned and smote the men of Gai.
006	JOS	008	022	And these came forth out of the city to meet them; and they were in the midst of the army, some [being] on this side, and some on that; and they smote them until there was not left of them one who survived and escaped.
006	JOS	008	023	And they took the king of Gai alive, and brought him to Joshua.
006	JOS	008	024	And when the children of Israel had ceased slaying all that were in Gai, and in the fields, and in the mountain on the descent, from whence they pursued them [even] to the end, then Joshua returned to Gai, and smote it with the edge of the sword.
006	JOS	008	025	And they that fell in that day, men and women, were twelve thousand: [they slew] all the inhabitants of Gai.
006	JOS	008	027	Beside the spoils that were in the city, all things which the children of Israel took as spoil for themselves according to the command of the Lord, as the Lord commanded Joshua.
006	JOS	008	028	And Joshua burnt the city with fire: he made it an uninhabited heap for ever, [even] to this day.
006	JOS	008	029	And he hanged the king of Gai on a gallows; and he remained on the tree till evening: and when the sun went down, Joshua gave charge, and they took down his body from the tree, and cast it into a pit, and they set over him a heap of stones until this day.
006	JOS	008	030	Then Joshua built an altar to the Lord God of Israel in mount Gaebal,
006	JOS	008	031	as Moses the servant of the Lord commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the law of Moses, an altar of unhewn stones, on which iron had not been lifted up; and he offered there whole-burnt-offerings to the Lord, and a peace-offering.
006	JOS	008	032	And Joshua wrote upon the stones a copy of the law, even the law of Moses, before the children of Israel.
006	JOS	008	033	And all Israel, and their elders, and their judges, and their scribes, passed on one side and on the other before the ark; and the priests and the Levites took up the ark of the covenant of the Lord; and the stranger and the native were there, who were half of them near mount Garizin, and half near mount Gaebal, as Moses the servant of the Lord commanded at first, to bless the people.
006	JOS	008	034	And afterwards Joshua read accordingly all the words of this law, the blessings and the curses, according to all things written in the law of Moses.
006	JOS	008	035	There was not a word of all that Moses charged Joshua, which Joshua read not in the ears of all the assembly of the children of Israel, the men, and the women, and the children, and the strangers that joined themselves to Israel.
006	JOS	009	001	And when the kings of the Amorites on the other side of Jordan, who were in the mountain country, and in the plain, and in all the coast of the great sea, and those who were near Antilibanus, and the Chettites, and the Chananites, and the Pherezites, and the Evites, and the Amorites, and the Gergesites, and the Jebusites, heard [of it],
006	JOS	009	002	they came all together at the same time to make war against Joshua and Israel.
006	JOS	009	003	And the inhabitants of Gabaon heard of all that the Lord did to Jericho and Gai.
006	JOS	009	004	And they also wrought craftily, and they went and made provision and prepared themselves; and having taken old sacks on their shoulders, and old and rent and patched bottles of wine,
006	JOS	009	005	and the upper part of their shoes and their sandals old and clouted on their feet, and their garments old upon them—and the bread of their provision was dry and mouldy and corrupt.
006	JOS	009	006	And they came to Joshua into the camp of Israel to Galgala, and said to Joshua and Israel, We are come from a far land: now then make a covenant with us.
006	JOS	009	007	And the children of Israel said to the Chorrhaean, Peradventure thou dwellest amongst us; and how should I make a covenant with thee?
006	JOS	009	008	And they said to Joshua, We are thy servants: and Joshua said to them, Whence are ye, and whence have ye come?
006	JOS	009	009	And they said, Thy servants are come from a very far country in the name of the Lord thy God: for we have heard his name, and all that he did in Egypt,
006	JOS	009	010	and all that he did to the kings of the Amorites, who were beyond Jordan, to Seon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Basan, who dwelt in Astaroth and in Edrain.
006	JOS	009	011	And our elders and all that inhabit our land when they heard spoke to us, saying, Take to yourselves provision for the way, and go to meet them; and ye shall say to them, We are thy servants, and now make a covenant with us.
006	JOS	009	012	These [are] the loaves—we took them hot for our journey on the day on which we came out to come to you; and now they are dried and become mouldy.
006	JOS	009	013	And these [are] the skins of wine which we filled when new, and they are rent; and our garments and our shoes are worn out because of the very long journey.
006	JOS	009	014	And the chiefs took of their provision, and asked not [counsel of] the Lord.
006	JOS	009	015	And Joshua made peace with them, and they made a covenant with them to preserve them; and the princes of the congregation sware to them.
006	JOS	009	016	And it came to pass three days after they had made a covenant with them, they heard that they were near neighbours, and that they dwelt among them.
006	JOS	009	017	And the children of Israel departed and came to their cities; and their cities [were] Gabaon, and Kephira, and Berot, and the cities of Jarin.
006	JOS	009	018	Land the children of Israel fought not with them, because all the princes sware to them by the Lord God of Israel; and all the congregation murmured at the princes.
006	JOS	009	019	And the princes said to all the congregation: We have sworn to them by the Lord God of Israel, and now we shall not be able to touch them.
006	JOS	009	020	This we will do; take them alive, and we will preserve them: so there shall not be wrath against us by reason of the oath which we swore to them.
006	JOS	009	021	They shall live, and shall be hewers of wood and drawers of water to all the congregation, as the princes said to them.
006	JOS	009	022	And Joshua called them together and said to them, Why have ye deceived me, saying, We live very far from you; whereas ye are fellow-countrymen of those who dwell among us?
006	JOS	009	023	And now ye are cursed: there shall not fail of you a slave, or a hewer of wood, or a drawer of water to me and my God.
006	JOS	009	024	And they answered Joshua, saying, It was reported to us what the Lord thy God charged his servant Moses, to give you this land, and to destroy us and all that dwelt on it from before you; and we feared very much for our lives because of you, and [therefore] we did this thing.
006	JOS	009	025	And now, behold, we [are] in your power; do to us as it is pleasing to you, and as it seems [good] to you.
006	JOS	009	026	And they did so to them; and Joshua rescued them in that day out of the hands of the children of Israel, and they did not slay them.
006	JOS	009	027	And Joshua made them in that day hewers of wood and drawers of water to the whole congregation, and for the altar of God: therefore the inhabitants of Gabaon became hewers of wood and drawers of water for the altar of God until this day, even for the place which the Lord should choose.
006	JOS	010	001	And when Adoni-bezec king of Jerusalem heard that Joshua had taken Gai, and had destroyed it, as he did to Jericho and its king, even so they did to Gai and its king, and that the inhabitants of Gabaon had gone over to Joshua and Israel;
006	JOS	010	002	then they were greatly terrified by them, for [the king] knew that Gabaon [was] a great city, as one of the chief cities, and all its men [were] mighty.
006	JOS	010	003	So Adoni-bezec king of Jerusalem sent to Elam king of Hebron, and to Phidon king of Jerimuth, and to Jephtha king of Lachis, and to Dabin king of Odollam, saying,
006	JOS	010	004	Come up hither to me, and help me, and let us take Gabaon; for the Gabaonites have gone over to Joshua and to the children of Israel.
006	JOS	010	005	And the five kings of the Jebusites went up, the king of Jerusalem, and the king of Chebron, and the king of Jerimuth, and the king of Lachis, and the king of Odollam, they and all their people; and encamped around Gabaon, and besieged it.
006	JOS	010	006	And the inhabitants of Gabaon sent to Joshua into the camp to Galgala, saying, Slack not thy hands from thy servants: come up quickly to us, and help us, and rescue us; for all the kings of the Amorites who dwell in the hill country are gathered together against us.
006	JOS	010	007	And Joshua went up from Galgala, he and all the people of war with him, every one mighty in strength.
006	JOS	010	008	And the Lord said to Joshua, Fear them not, for I have delivered them into thy hands; there shall not one of them be left before you.
006	JOS	010	009	And when Joshua came suddenly upon them, he [had] advanced all the night out of Galgala.
006	JOS	010	010	And the Lord struck them with terror before the children of Israel; and the Lord destroyed them with a great slaughter at Gabaon; and they pursued them by the way of the going up of Oronin, and they smote them to Azeca and to Makeda.
006	JOS	010	011	And when they fled from the face of the children of Israel at the descent of Oronin, then the Lord cast upon them hailstones from heaven to Azeca; and they were more that died by the hailstones, than those whom the children of Israel slew with the sword in the battle.
006	JOS	010	012	Then Joshua spoke to the Lord, in the day in which the Lord delivered the Amorite into the power of Israel, when he destroyed them in Gabaon, and they were destroyed from before the children of Israel: and Joshua said, Let the sun stand over against Gabaon, and the moon over against the valley of Aelon.
006	JOS	010	013	And the sun and the moon stood still, until God executed vengeance on their enemies; and the sun stood still in the midst of heaven; it did not proceed to set till the end of one day.
006	JOS	010	014	And there was not such a day either before or after, so that God should hearken to a man, because the Lord fought on the side of Israel.
006	JOS	010	016	And these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave that is in Makeda.
006	JOS	010	017	And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings have been found hid in the cave that is in Makeda.
006	JOS	010	018	And Joshua said, Roll stones to the mouth of the cave, and set men to watch over them.
006	JOS	010	019	But do not ye stand, but pursue after your enemies, and attack the rear of them, and do not suffer them to enter into their cities; for the Lord our God has delivered them into our hands.
006	JOS	010	020	And it came to pass when Joshua and all Israel ceased destroying them utterly with a very great slaughter, that they that escaped took refuge in the strong cities.
006	JOS	010	021	And all the people returned safe to Joshua to Makeda; and no one of the children of Israel murmured with his tongue.
006	JOS	010	022	And Joshua said, Open the cave, and bring out these five kings out of the cave.
006	JOS	010	023	And they brought out the five kings out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, and the king of Chebron, and the king of Jerimuth, and the king of Lachis, and the king of Odollam.
006	JOS	010	024	And when they brought them out to Joshua, then Joshua called together all Israel, and the chiefs of the army that went with him, saying to them, Come forward and set your feet on their necks; and they came and set their feet on their necks.
006	JOS	010	025	And Joshua said to them, Do not fear them, neither be cowardly; be courageous and strong, for thus the Lord will do to all your enemies, against whom ye fight.
006	JOS	010	026	And Joshua slew them, and hanged them on five trees; and they hung upon the trees until the evening.
006	JOS	010	027	And it came to pass toward the setting of the sun, Joshua commanded, and they took them down from the trees, and cast them into the cave into which they [had] fled for refuge, and rolled stones to the cave, [which remain] till this day.
006	JOS	010	028	And they took Makeda on that day, and slew the inhabitants with the edge of the sword, and they utterly destroyed every living thing that was in it; and there was none left in it that was preserved and had escaped; and they did to the king of Makeda, as they did to the king of Jericho.
006	JOS	010	029	And Joshua and all Israel with him departed out of Makeda to Lebna, and besieged Lebna.
006	JOS	010	030	And the Lord delivered it into the hands of Israel: and they took it, and its king, and slew the inhabitants with the edge of the sword, and every thing breathing in it; and there was not left in it any that survived and escaped; and they did to its king, as they did to the king of Jericho.
006	JOS	010	031	And Joshua and all Israel with him departed from Lebna to Lachis, and he encamped about it, and besieged it.
006	JOS	010	032	And the Lord delivered Lachis into the hands of Israel; and they took it on the second day, and they put the inhabitants to death with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed it, as they had done to Lebna.
006	JOS	010	033	Then Elam the king of Gazer went up to help Lachis; and Joshua smote him and his people with the edge of the sword, until there was not left to him one that was preserved and escaped.
006	JOS	010	034	And Joshua and all Israel with him departed from Lachis to Odollam, and he besieged it and took it.
006	JOS	010	035	And the Lord delivered it into the hand of Israel; and he took it on that day, and slew the inhabitants with the edge of the sword, and slew every thing breathing in it, as they did to Lachis.
006	JOS	010	036	And Joshua and all Israel with him departed to Chebron, and encamped about it.
006	JOS	010	037	And he smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the living creatures that were in it; there was no one preserved: they destroyed it and all things in it, as they did to Odollam.
006	JOS	010	038	And Joshua and all Israel returned to Dabir; and they encamped about it;
006	JOS	010	039	and they took it, and its king, and its villages: and he smote it with the edge of the sword, and they destroyed it, and every thing breathing in it; and they did not leave in it any one that was preserved: as they did to Chebron and her king, so they did to Dabir and her king.
006	JOS	010	040	And Joshua smote all the land of the hill country, and Nageb and the plain country, and Asedoth, and her kings, they did not leave of them one that was saved: and they utterly destroyed every thing that had the breath of life, as the Lord God of Israel commanded,
006	JOS	010	041	from Cades Barne to Gaza, all Gosom, as far as Gabaon.
006	JOS	010	042	And Joshua smote, once for all, all their kings, and their land, because the Lord God of Israel fought on the side of Israel.
006	JOS	011	001	And when Jabis the king of Asor heard, he sent to Jobab king of Maron, and to the king of Symoon, and to the king of Aziph,
006	JOS	011	002	and to the kings who were by the great Sidon, to the hill country and to Araba opposite Keneroth, and to the plain, and to Phenaeddor,
006	JOS	011	003	and to the Chananites on the coast eastward, and to the Amorites on the coast, and the Chettites, and the Pherezites, and the Jebusites in the mountain, and the Evites, and those dwelling under [mount] Aermon in the land Massyma.
006	JOS	011	004	And they and their kings with them went forth, as the sand of the sea in multitude, and horses, and very many chariots.
006	JOS	011	005	And all the kings assembled in person, and came to the same place, and encamped at the waters of Maron to war with Israel.
006	JOS	011	006	And the Lord said to Joshua, Be not afraid of them, for to-morrow [at] this time I will put them to flight before Israel: thou shalt hough their horses, and burn their chariots with fire
006	JOS	011	007	And Joshua and all the men of war came upon them at the water of Maron suddenly; and they attacked them in the hill country.
006	JOS	011	008	And the Lord delivered them into the power of Israel; and they smote them and pursued them to great Sidon, and to Maseron, and to the plains of Massoch eastward; and they destroyed them till there was not one of them left that survived.
006	JOS	011	009	And Joshua did to them, as the Lord commanded him: he houghed their horses, and burned their chariots with fire.
006	JOS	011	010	And Joshua returned at that time, and took Asor and her king; now Asor in former time was the chief of these kingdoms.
006	JOS	011	011	And they slew with the sword all that breathed in it, and utterly destroyed them all, and there was no living thing left in it; and they burnt Asor with fire.
006	JOS	011	012	And Joshua took all the cities of the kingdoms, and their kings, and slew them with the edge of the sword; and utterly slew them, as Moses the servant of the Lord commanded.
006	JOS	011	013	But all the walled cities Israel burnt not; but Israel burnt Asor only.
006	JOS	011	014	And the children of Israel took all its spoils to themselves; and they slew all the men with the edge of the sword, until he destroyed them; they left not one of them breathing.
006	JOS	011	015	As the Lord commanded his servant Moses, even so Moses commanded Joshua; and so Joshua did, he transgressed no precept of all that Moses commanded him.
006	JOS	011	016	And Joshua took all the hill country, and all the land of Nageb, and all the land of Gosom, and the plain country, and that toward the west, and the mountain of Israel and the low country by the mountain;
006	JOS	011	017	from the mountain of Chelcha, and that which goes up to Seir, and as far as Balagad, and the plains of Libanus, under mount Aermon; and he took all their kings, and destroyed, and slew them.
006	JOS	011	018	And for many days Joshua waged war with these kings.
006	JOS	011	019	And there was no city which Israel took not; they took all in war.
006	JOS	011	020	For it was of the Lord to harden their hearts to go forth to war against Israel, that they might be utterly destroyed, that mercy should not be granted to them, but that they should be utterly destroyed, as the Lord said to Moses.
006	JOS	011	021	And Joshua came at that time, and utterly destroyed the Enakim out of the hill country, from Chebron and from Dabir, and from Anaboth, and from all the race of Israel, and from all the mountain of Juda with their cities; and Joshua utterly destroyed them.
006	JOS	011	022	There was not [any one] left of the Enakim by the children of Israel, only there was left of them in Gaza, and in Gath, and in Aseldo.
006	JOS	011	023	And Joshua took all the land, as the Lord commanded Moses; and Joshua gave them for an inheritance to Israel by division according to their tribes; and the land ceased from war.
006	JOS	012	001	And these [are] the kings of the land, whom the children of Israel slew, and inherited their land beyond Jordan from the east, from the valley of Arnon to the mount of Aermon, and all the land of Araba on the east.

006	JOS	012	005	ruling from mount Aermon and from Secchai, and [over] all the land of Basan to the borders of Gergesi, and Machi, and the half of Galaad of the borders of Seon king of Esebon.
006	JOS	012	006	Moses the servant of the Lord and the children of Israel smote them; and Moses gave them by way of inheritance to Ruben, and Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasse.
006	JOS	012	007	And these [are] the kings of the Amorites, whom Joshua and the children of Israel slew beyond Jordan by the sea of Balagad in the plain of Libanus, and as far as the mountain of Chelcha, as men go up to Seir: and Joshua gave it to the tribes of Israel to inherit according to their portion;

006	JOS	012	024	the king of Thersa: all these [were] twenty-nine kings.
006	JOS	013	001	And Joshua [was] old and very advanced in years; and the Lord said to Joshua, Thou art advanced in years, and there is much land left to inherit.
006	JOS	013	002	And this [is] the land that is left: the borders of the Phylistines, the Gesirite, and the Chananite,
006	JOS	013	003	from the wilderness before Egypt, as far as the borders of Accaron on the left of the Chananites [the land] is reckoned to the five principalities of the Phylistines, to the inhabitant of Gaza, and of Azotus, and of Ascalon, and of Geth, and of Accaron, and to the Evite;

006	JOS	013	006	every one that inhabits the hill country from Libanus as far as Masereth Memphomaim. All the Sidonians, I will destroy them from before Israel; but do thou give them by inheritance to Israel, as I charged thee.
006	JOS	013	007	And now divide this land by lot to the nine tribes, and to the half tribe of Manasse.
006	JOS	013	008	From Jordan to the great sea westward thou shalt give it [them]: the great sea shall be the boundary. [But] to the two tribes and to the half tribe of Manasse, to Ruben and to Gad Moses gave [an inheritance] beyond Jordan: Moses the servant of the Lord gave [it] to them eastward,
006	JOS	013	009	from Aroer, which is on the bank of the brook of Arnon, and the city in the midst of the valley, and all Misor from Maedaban.

006	JOS	013	012	All the kingdom of Og in the region of Basan, who reigned in Astaroth and in Edrain: he was left of the giants; and Moses smote him, and destroyed him.
006	JOS	013	013	But the children of Israel destroyed not the Gesirite and the Machatite and the Chananite; and the king of the Gesiri and the Machatite dwelt among the children of Israel until this day.
006	JOS	013	014	Only no inheritance was given to the tribe of Levi: the Lord God of Israel, he [is] their inheritance, as the Lord said to them; and this [is] the division which Moses made to the children of Israel in Araboth Moab, on the other side of Jordan, by Jericho.
006	JOS	013	015	And Moses gave the land to the tribe of Ruben according to their families.
006	JOS	013	016	And their borders were from Aroer, which is opposite the brook of Arnon, and [theirs is] the city that is in the valley of Arnon; and all Misor,
006	JOS	013	017	to Esebon, and all the cities in Misor, and Daebon, and Baemon-Baal, and the house of Meelboth;

006	JOS	013	021	and all the cities of Misor, and all the kingdom of Seon king of the Amorites, whom Moses smote, even him and the princes of Madian, and Evi, and Roboc, and Sur, and Ur, and Robe prince of the spoils of Sion, and the inhabitants of Sion.
006	JOS	013	022	And Balaam the son of Baeor the prophet they slew in the battle.
006	JOS	013	023	And the borders of Ruben were—[even] Jordan [was the] boundary; this [is] the inheritance of the children of Ruben according to their families, [these were] their cities and their villages.
006	JOS	013	024	And Moses gave inheritance to the sons of Gad according to their families.
006	JOS	013	025	And their borders were Jazer, all the cities of Galaad, and half the land of the children of Ammon to Araba, which is before Arad.
006	JOS	013	026	And from Esebon to Araboth by Massepha, and Botanim, and Maan to the borders of Daebon,
006	JOS	013	027	and Enadom, and Othargai, and Baenthanabra, and Soccotha, and Saphan, and the rest of the kingdom of Sean king of Esebon: and Jordan shall be the boundary as far as part of the sea of Chenereth beyond Jordan eastward.
006	JOS	013	028	This [is] the inheritance of the children of Gad according to their families and according to their cities: according to their families they will turn their backs before their enemies, because their cities and their villages were according to their families.
006	JOS	013	029	And Moses gave to half the tribe of Manasse according to their families.
006	JOS	013	030	And their borders were from Maan, and all the kingdom of Basan, and all the kingdom of Og king of Basan, and all the villages of Jair, which are in the region of Basan, sixty cities:
006	JOS	013	031	and the half of Galaad, and in Astaroth, and in Edrain, royal cities of Og in the land of Basan, [Moses gave] to the sons of Machir the sons of Manasse, even to the half-tribe sons of Machir the sons of Manasse, according to their families.
006	JOS	013	032	These [are] they whom Moses caused to inherit beyond Jordan in Araboth Moab, beyond Jordan by Jericho eastward.
006	JOS	014	001	And these [are] they of the children of Israel that received their inheritance in the land of Chanaan, to whom Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the [son] of Naue, and the heads of the families of the tribes of the children of Israel, gave inheritance.
006	JOS	014	002	They inherited according to their lots, as the Lord commanded by the hand of Joshua to the nine tribes and the half tribe, on the other side of Jordan.
006	JOS	014	003	But to the Levites he gave no inheritance among them.
006	JOS	014	004	For the sons of Joseph were two tribes, Manasse and Ephraim; and there was none inheritance in the land given to the Levites, only cities to dwell in, and their suburbs separated for the cattle, and their cattle.
006	JOS	014	005	As the Lord commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel; and they divided the land.
006	JOS	014	006	And the children of Juda came to Joshua in Galgal, and Chaleb the [son] of Jephone the Kenezite said to him, Thou knowest the word that the Lord spoke to Moses the man of God concerning me and thee in Cades Barne.
006	JOS	014	007	For I was forty years old when Moses the servant of God sent me out of Cades Barne to spy out the land; and I returned him an answer according to his mind.
006	JOS	014	008	My brethren that went up with me turned away the heart of the people, but I applied my self to follow the Lord my God.
006	JOS	014	009	And Moses sware on that day, saying, The land on which thou art gone up, it shall be thy inheritance and thy children's for ever, because thou hast applied thyself to follow the Lord our God.
006	JOS	014	010	And now the Lord has kept me alive as he said: this [is] the forty-fifth year since the Lord spoke that word to Moses; and Israel journeyed in the wilderness; and now, behold, I [am] this day eighty-five years old.
006	JOS	014	011	I am still strong this day, as when the Lord sent me: just so strong am I now to go out and to come in for war.
006	JOS	014	012	And now I ask of thee this mountain, as the Lord said in that day; for thou heardest this word on that day; and now the Enakim are there, cities great and strong: if then the Lord should be with me, I will utterly destroy them, as the Lord said to me.
006	JOS	014	013	And Joshua blessed him, and gave Chebron to Chaleb the son of Jephone the son of Kenez for an inheritance.
006	JOS	014	014	Therefore Chebron became the inheritance of Chaleb the [son] of Jephone the Kenezite until this day, because he followed the commandment of the Lord God of Israel.
006	JOS	014	015	And the name of Chebron before was the city Argob, it [is] the metropolis of the Enakim: and the land rested from war.
006	JOS	015	001	And the borders of the tribe of Juda according to their families were from the borders of Idumea from the wilderness of sin, as far as Cades southward.
006	JOS	015	002	And their borders were from the south as far as a part of the salt sea from the high country that extends southward.
006	JOS	015	003	And they proceed before the ascent of Acrabin, and go out round Sena, and go up from the south to Cades Barne; and go out to Asoron, and proceed up to Sarada, and go out by the way that is west of Cades.
006	JOS	015	004	And they go out to Selmona, and issue at the valley of Egypt; and the termination of its boundaries shall be at the sea: these are their boundaries southward.
006	JOS	015	005	And their boundaries eastward [are] all the salt sea as far as Jordan; and their borders from the north, and from the border of the sea, and from part of Jordan—
006	JOS	015	006	the borders go up to Baethaglaam, and they go along from the north to Baetharaba, and the borders go on up to the stone of Baeon the son of Ruben.
006	JOS	015	007	And the borders continue on to the fourth part of the valley of Achor, and go down to Galgal, which is before the approach of Adammin, which is southward in the valley, and terminate at the water of the fountain of the sun; and their going forth shall be the fountain of Rogel.
006	JOS	015	008	And the borders go up to the valley of Ennom, behind Jebus southward; this is Jerusalem: and the borders terminate at the top of the mountain, which is before the valley of Ennom toward the sea, which is by the side of the land of Raphain northward.
006	JOS	015	009	And the border [going forth] from the top of the mountain terminates at the fountain of the water of Naphtho, and terminates at mount Ephron; and the border will lead to Baal; this is the city of Jarim.
006	JOS	015	010	And the border will go round from Baal to the sea, and will go on to the mount of Assar behind the city of Jarin northwards; this is Chaslon: and it will come down to the city of Sun, and will go on to the south.
006	JOS	015	011	And the border terminates behind Accaron northward, and the borders will terminate at Socchoth, and the borders will go on to the south, and will terminate at Lebna, and the issue of the borders will be at the sea; and their borders [shall be] toward the sea, the great sea shall be the boundary.
006	JOS	015	012	These [are] the borders of the children of Juda round about according to their families.
006	JOS	015	013	And to Chaleb the son of Jephone he gave a portion in the midst of the children of Juda by the command of God; and Joshua gave him the city of Arboc the metropolis of Enac; this is Chebron.
006	JOS	015	014	And Chaleb the son of Jephone destroyed thence the three sons of Enac, Susi, and Tholami, and Achima.
006	JOS	015	015	And Chaleb went up thence to the inhabitants of Dabir; and the name of Dabir before was the city of Letters.
006	JOS	015	016	And Chaleb said, Whosoever shall take and destroy the city of Letters, and master it, to him will I give my daughter Ascha to wife.
006	JOS	015	017	And Gothoniel the son of Chenez the brother of Chaleb took it; and he gave him Ascha his daughter to wife.
006	JOS	015	018	And it came to pass as she went out that she counselled him, saying, I will ask of my father a field; and she cried from off her ass; and Chaleb said to her, What is it?
006	JOS	015	019	And she said to him, Give me a blessing, for thou hast set me in the land of Nageb; give me Botthanis: and he gave her Gonaethla the upper, and Gonaethla the lower.
006	JOS	015	020	This [is] the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Juda.
006	JOS	015	021	And their cities were cities belonging to the tribe of the children of Juda on the borders of Edom by the wilderness, and Baeseleel, and Ara, and Asor,

006	JOS	016	010	And Ephraim did not destroy the Chananite who dwelt in Gazer; and the Chananite dwelt in Ephraim until this day, until Pharao the king of Egypt went up and took it, and burnt it with fire; and the Chananites, and Pherezites, and the dwellers in Gaza they destroyed, and Pharao gave them for a dowry to his daughter.
006	JOS	017	001	And the borders of the tribe of the children of Manasse, (for he [was] the first-born of Joseph,) [assigned] to Machir the first-born of Manasse the father of Galaad, for he was a warrior, [were] in the land of Galaad and of Basan.
006	JOS	017	002	And there was [land] assigned to the other sons of Manasse according to their families; to the sons of Jezi, and to the sons of Kelez, and to the sons of Jeziel, and to the sons of Sychem, and to the sons of Symarim, and to the sons of Opher: these [are] the males according to their families.

006	JOS	017	004	And they stood before Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua, and before the rulers, saying, God gave a charge by the hand of Moses, to give us an inheritance in the midst of our brethren: so there was given to them by the command of the Lord an inheritance among the brethren of their father.
006	JOS	017	005	And their lot fell [to them] from Anassa, and [to the] plain of Labec of the land of Galaad, which is beyond Jordan.
006	JOS	017	006	For the daughters of the sons of Manasse inherited a portion in the midst of their brethren, and the land of Galaad was assigned to the remainder of the sons of Manasse.

006	JOS	017	008	It shall belong to Manasse, and Thapheth on the borders of Manasse [shall belong] to the sons of Ephraim.
006	JOS	017	009	And the borders shall go down to the valley of Carana southward by the valley of Jariel, ([there is] a turpentine tree [belonging] to Ephraim between [that and] the city of Manasse:) and the borders of Manasse [are] northward to the brook; and the sea shall be its termination.
006	JOS	017	010	Southward [the land belongs] to Ephraim, and northward to Manasse; and the sea shall be their cost; and northward they shall border upon Aseb, and eastward upon Issachar.
006	JOS	017	011	And Manasses shall have in [the portion of] Issachar and Aser Baethsan and their villages, and the inhabitants of Dor, and its villages, and the inhabitants of Mageddo, and its villages, and the third part of Mapheta, and its villages.
006	JOS	017	012	And the sons of Manasse were not able to destroy these cities; and the Chananite began to dwell in that land.
006	JOS	017	013	And it came to pass that when the children of Israel were strong, they made the Chananites subject, but they did not utterly destroy them.
006	JOS	017	014	And the sons of Joseph answered Joshua, saying, Wherefore hast thou caused us to inherit one inheritance, and one line? whereas I am a great people, and God has blessed me.
006	JOS	017	015	And Joshua said to them, If thou be a great people, go up to the forest, and clear [the land] for thyself, If mount Ephraim be too little for thee.
006	JOS	017	016	And they said, The mount of Ephraim does not please us, and the Chananite dwelling in it in Baethsan, and in its villages, [and] in the valley of Jezrael, has choice cavalry and iron.
006	JOS	017	017	And Joshua said to the sons of Joseph, If thou art a great people, and hast great strength, thou shalt not have [only] one inheritance.
006	JOS	017	018	For thou shalt have the wood, for there is a wood, and thou shalt clear it, and [the land] shall be thine; even when thou shalt have utterly destroyed the Chananite, for he has chosen cavalry; yet thou art stronger than he.
006	JOS	018	001	And all the congregation of the children of Israel were assembled at Selo, and there they pitched the tabernacle of witness; and the land was subdued by them.
006	JOS	018	002	And the sons of Israel remained, [even] those who [had] not received their inheritance, seven tribes.
006	JOS	018	003	And Joshua said to the sons of Israel, How long will ye be slack to inherit the land, which the Lord our God has given you?
006	JOS	018	004	Appoint of yourselves three men of each tribe, and let them rise up and go through the land, and let them describe it before me, as it will be proper to divide it.
006	JOS	018	005	And they came to him: and he divided to them seven portions, [saying], Juda shall stand to them a border southward, and the sons of Joseph shall stand to them northward.
006	JOS	018	006	And do ye divide the land into seven parts, and bring the description hither to me, and I will give you a lot before the Lord our God.
006	JOS	018	007	For the sons of Levi have no part among you; for the priesthood of the Lord [is] his portion; and Gad, and Ruben, and the half tribe of Manasse, have received their inheritance beyond Jordan eastward, which Moses the servant of the Lord gave to them.
006	JOS	018	008	And the men rose up and went; and Joshua charged the men who went to explore the land, saying, Go and explore the land, and come to me, and I will bring you forth a lot here before the Lord in Selo.
006	JOS	018	009	And they went, and explored the land: and they viewed it, and described it according to the cities, seven parts in a book, and brought [the book] to Joshua.
006	JOS	018	010	And Joshua cast the lot for them in Selo before the Lord.
006	JOS	018	011	And the lot of the tribe of Benjamin came forth first according to their families: and the borders of their lot came forth between the children of Juda and the children of Joseph.

006	JOS	019	009	The inheritance of the tribe of the children of Symeon [was a part] of the lot of Juda, for the portion of the children of Juda was greater than theirs; and the children of Symeon inherited in the midst of their lot.
006	JOS	019	010	And the third lot came out to Zabulon according to their families: the bounds of their inheritance shall be—Esedekgola shall be their border,

006	JOS	019	048	And the sons of Dan went and fought against Lachis, and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword; and they dwelt in it, and called the name of it Lasendan: and the Amorite continued to dwell in Edom and in Salamin: and the hand of Ephraim prevailed against them, and they became tribute to them.
006	JOS	019	049	And they proceeded to take possession of the land according to their borders, and the children of Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua the son of Naue among them,
006	JOS	019	050	by the command of God, and they gave him the city which he asked for, Thamnasarach, which is in the mount of Ephraim; and he built the city, and dwelt in it.
006	JOS	019	051	These [are] the divisions which Eleazar the priest divided by lot, and Joshua the [son] of Naue, and the heads of families among the tribes of Israel, according to the lots, in Selo before the Lord by the doors of the tabernacle of testimony, and they went to take possession of the land.
006	JOS	020	001	And the Lord spoke to Joshua, saying,
006	JOS	020	002	Speak to the children of Israel, saying, Assign the cities of refuge, [of] which I spoke to you by Moses.
006	JOS	020	003	[Even] a refuge to the slayer who has smitten a man unintentionally; and the cities shall be to you a refuge, and the slayer shall not be put to death by the avenger of blood, until he have stood before the congregation for judgment.
006	JOS	020	004	And Joshua separated Cades in Galilee in the mount Nephthali, and Sychem in the mount Ephraim, and the city of Arboc; this is Chebron, in the mountain of Juda.
006	JOS	020	005	And beyond Jordan he appointed Bosor in the wilderness in the plain out of the tribe of Ruben, and Aremoth in Galaad out of the tribe of Gad, and Gaulon in the country of Basan out of the tribe of Manasse.
006	JOS	020	006	These [were] the cities selected for the sons of Israel, and for the stranger abiding among them, that every one who smites a soul unintentionally should flee thither, that he should not die by the hand of the avenger of blood, until he should stand before the congregation for judgment.
006	JOS	021	001	And the heads of the families of the sons of Levi drew near to Eleazar the priest, and to Joshua the [son] of Naue, and to the heads of families of the tribes of Israel.
006	JOS	021	002	And they spoke to them in Selo in the land of Chanaan, saying, The Lord gave commandment by Moses to give us cities to dwell in, and the country round about for our cattle.
006	JOS	021	003	So the children of Israel gave to the Levites in their inheritance by the command of the Lord the cities and the country round.
006	JOS	021	004	And the lot came out for the children of Caath; and the sons of Aaron, the priests the Levites, had by lot thirteen cities out of the tribe of Juda, and out of the tribe of Symeon, and out of the tribe of Benjamin.

006	JOS	021	006	And the sons of Gedson had thirteen cities, out of the tribe of Issachar, and out of the tribe of Aser, and out of the tribe of Nephthali, and out of the half tribe of Manasse in Basan.
006	JOS	021	007	And the sons of Merari according to their families had by lot twelve cities, out of the tribe of Ruben, and out of the tribe of Gad, and out of the tribe of Zabulon.
006	JOS	021	008	And the children of Israel gave to the Levites the cities and their suburbs, as the Lord commanded Moses, by lot.
006	JOS	021	009	And the tribe of the children of Juda, and the tribe of the children of Symeon, and [part] of the tribe of the children of Benjamin gave these cities, and they were assigned
006	JOS	021	010	to the sons of Aaron of the family of Caath of the sons of Levi, for the lot fell to these.
006	JOS	021	011	And they gave to them Cariatharboc the metropolis of the sons of Enac; this is Chebron in the mountain [country] of Juda, and the suburbs round it.
006	JOS	021	012	But the lands of the city, and its villages Joshua gave to the sons of Chaleb the son of Jephonne for a possession.
006	JOS	021	013	And to the sons of Aaron he gave the city of refuge for the slayer, Chebron, and the suburbs belonging to it; and Lemna and the suburbs belonging to it;
006	JOS	021	014	and Aelom and its suburbs; and Tema and its suburbs;
006	JOS	021	015	and Gella and its suburbs; and Dabir and its suburbs;
006	JOS	021	016	and Asa and its suburbs; and Tany and its suburbs; and Baethsamys and its suburbs: nine cities from these two tribes.
006	JOS	021	017	And from the tribe of Benjamin, Gabaon and its suburbs; and Gatheth and its suburbs;
006	JOS	021	018	and Anathoth and its suburbs; and Gamala and its suburbs; four cities.
006	JOS	021	019	All the cities of the sons of Aaron the priests, thirteen.
006	JOS	021	020	And to the families, [even] the sons of Caath the Levites, that were left of the sons of Caath, there was [given] their priests' city,
006	JOS	021	021	out of the tribe of Ephraim; and they gave them the slayer's city of refuge, Sychem, and its suburbs, and Gazara and its appendages, and its suburbs;
006	JOS	021	022	and Baethoron and its suburbs: four cities:
006	JOS	021	023	and the tribe of Dan, Helcothaim and its suburbs; and Gethedan and its suburbs:
006	JOS	021	024	and Aelon and its suburbs; and Getheremmon and its suburbs: four cities.
006	JOS	021	025	And out of the half tribe of Manasse, Tanach and its suburbs; and Jebatha and its suburbs; two cities.
006	JOS	021	026	In all [were given] ten cities, and the suburbs of each belonging to them, to the families of the sons of Caath that remained.
006	JOS	021	027	And [Joshua gave] to the sons of Gedson the Levites out of the other half tribe of Manasse cities set apart for the slayers, Gaulon in the country of Basan, and its suburbs; and Bosora and its suburbs; two cities.
006	JOS	021	028	And out of the tribe of Issachar, Kison and its suburbs; and Debba and its suburbs;

006	JOS	021	031	and Chelcat and its suburbs; and Raab and its suburbs; four cities.
006	JOS	021	032	And of the tribe of Nephthali, the city set apart for the slayer, Cades in Galilee, and its suburbs; and Nemmath, and its suburbs; and Themmon and its suburbs; three cities.
006	JOS	021	033	All the cities of Gedson according to their families [were] thirteen cities.
006	JOS	021	034	And to the family of the sons of Merari the Levites that remained, [he gave] out of the tribe of Zabulon, Maan and its suburbs; and Cades and its suburbs,
006	JOS	021	035	and Sella and its suburbs: three cities.
006	JOS	021	036	And beyond Jordan over against Jericho, out of the tribe of Ruben, the city of refuge for the slayer, Bosor in the wilderness; Miso and its suburbs; and Jazer and its suburbs; and Decmon and its suburbs; and Mapha and its suburbs; four cities.
006	JOS	021	037	And out of the tribe of Gad the city of refuge for the slayer, both Ramoth in Galaad, and its suburbs; Camin and its suburbs; and Esbon and its suburbs; and Jazer and its suburbs: the cities [were] four in all.
006	JOS	021	040	All [these] cities [were given] to the sons of Merari according to the families of them that were left out of the tribe of Levi; and their limits were the twelve cities.
006	JOS	021	041	All the cities of the Levites in the midst of the possession of the children of Israel, [were] forty-eight cities,
006	JOS	021	042	and their suburbs round about these cities: a city and the suburbs round about the city to all these cities: and Joshua ceased dividing the land by their borders: and the children of Israel gave a portion to Joshua because of the commandment of the Lord: they gave him the city which he asked: they gave him Thamnasachar in mount Ephraim; and Joshua built the city, and dwelt in it: and Joshua took the knives of stone, wherewith he circumcised the children of Israel that were born in the desert by the way, and put them in Thamnasachar.
006	JOS	021	043	So the Lord gave to Israel all the land which he sware to give to their fathers: and they inherited it, and dwelt in it.
006	JOS	021	044	And the Lord gave them rest round about, as he sware to their fathers: not one of all their enemies maintained his ground against them; the Lord delivered all their enemies into their hands.
006	JOS	021	045	There failed not one of the good things which the Lord spoke to the children of Israel; all came to pass.
006	JOS	022	001	Then Joshua called together the sons of Ruben, and the sons of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasse,
006	JOS	022	002	and said to them, Ye have heard all that Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you, and ye have hearkened to my voice in all that he commanded you.
006	JOS	022	003	Ye have not deserted your brethren these many days: until this day ye have kept the commandment of the Lord your God.
006	JOS	022	004	And now the Lord our God has given our brethren rest, as he told them: now then return and depart to your homes, and to the land of your possession, which Moses gave you on the other side Jordan.
006	JOS	022	005	But take great heed to do the commands and the law, which Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you to do; to love the Lord our God, to walk in all his ways, to keep his commands, and to cleave to him, and serve him with all your mind, and with all your soul.
006	JOS	022	006	And Joshua blessed them, and dismissed them; and they went to their homes.
006	JOS	022	007	And to [one] half the tribe of Manasse Moses gave a portion in the land of Basan, and to [the other] half Joshua gave a portion with his brethren on the other side of Jordan westward: and when Joshua sent them away to their homes, then he blessed them.
006	JOS	022	008	And they departed with much wealth to their houses, and they divided the spoil of their enemies with their brethren; very much cattle, and silver, and gold, and iron, and much raiment.
006	JOS	022	009	So the sons of Ruben, and the sons of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasse, departed from the children of Israel in Selo in the land of Chanaan, to go away into Galaad, into the land of their possession, which they inherited by the command of the Lord, by the hand of Moses.
006	JOS	022	010	And they came to Galaad of Jordan, which is in the land of Chanaan: and the children of Ruben, and the children of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasse built there an altar by Jordan, a great altar to look at.
006	JOS	022	011	And the children of Israel heard say, Behold, the sons of Ruben, and the sons of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasse have built an altar at the borders of the land of Chanaan at Galaad of Jordan, on the opposite side to the children of Israel.
006	JOS	022	012	And all the children of Israel gathered together to Selo, so as to go up and fight against them.
006	JOS	022	013	And the children of Israel sent to the sons of Ruben, and the sons of Gad, and to the sons of the half tribe of Manasse into the land of Galaad, both Phinees the son of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest,
006	JOS	022	014	and ten of the chiefs with him; [there was] one chief of every household out of all the tribes of Israel; (the heads of families are the captains of thousands in Israel.)
006	JOS	022	015	And they came to the sons of Ruben, and to the sons of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasse into the land of Galaad; and they spoke to them, saying,
006	JOS	022	016	Thus says the whole congregation of the Lord, What [is] this transgression that ye have transgressed before the God of Israel, to turn away today from the Lord, in that ye have built for yourselves an altar, so that ye should be apostates from the Lord?
006	JOS	022	017	Is the sin of Phogor too little for you, whereas we have not been cleansed from it until this day, though there was a plague among the congregation of the Lord?
006	JOS	022	018	And ye have this day revolted from the Lord; and it shall come to pass if ye revolt this day from the Lord, that to-morrow there shall be wrath upon all Israel.
006	JOS	022	019	And now if the land of your possession [be too] little, cross over to the land of the possession of the Lord, where the tabernacle of the Lord dwells, and receive ye an inheritance among us; and do not become apostates from God, neither do ye apostatize from the Lord, because of your having built an altar apart from the altar of the Lord our God.
006	JOS	022	020	Lo! did not Achar the [son] of Zara commit a trespass [taking] of the accursed thing, and there was wrath on the whole congregation of Israel? and he himself died alone in his own sin.
006	JOS	022	021	And the sons of Ruben, and the sons of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasse answered, and spoke to the captains of the thousands of Israel, saying,
006	JOS	022	022	God [even] God is the Lord, and God [even] God himself knows, and Israel he shall know; if we have transgressed before the Lord by apostasy, let him not deliver us this day.
006	JOS	022	023	And if we have built to ourselves an altar, so as to apostatize from the Lord our God, so as to offer upon it a sacrifice of whole-burnt-offerings, so as to offer upon it a sacrifice of peace-offering, —the Lord shall require it.
006	JOS	022	024	But we have done this for the sake of precaution [concerning this] thing, saying, Lest hereafter your sons should say to our sons, What have ye to do with the Lord God of Israel?
006	JOS	022	025	Whereas the Lord has set boundaries between us and you, even Jordan, and ye have no portion in the Lord: so your sons shall alienate our sons, that they should not worship the Lord.
006	JOS	022	026	And we gave orders to do thus, to build this altar, not for burnt-offerings, nor for meat-offerings;
006	JOS	022	027	but that this may be a witness between you and us, and between our posterity after us, that we may do service to the Lord before him, with our burnt-offerings and our meat-offerings and our peace-offerings: so your sons shall not say to our sons, hereafter, Ye have no portion in the Lord.
006	JOS	022	028	And we said, If ever it should come to pass that they should speak [so] to us, or to our posterity hereafter; then shall they say, Behold the likeness of the altar of the Lord, which our fathers made, not for the sake of burnt-offerings, nor for the sake of meat-offerings, but it is a witness between you and us, and between our sons.
006	JOS	022	029	Far be it from us therefore that we should turn away from the Lord this day so as to apostatize from the Lord, so as that we should build an altar for burnt-offerings, and for peace-offerings, besides the altar of the Lord which is before his tabernacle.
006	JOS	022	030	And Phinees the priest and all the chiefs of the congregation of Israel who were with him heard the words which the children of Ruben, and the children of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasse spoke; and it pleased them.
006	JOS	022	031	And Phinees the priest said to the sons of Ruben, and to the sons of Gad, and to the half of the tribe of Manasse, To-day we know that the Lord [is] with us, because ye have not trespassed grievously against the Lord, and because ye have delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of the Lord.
006	JOS	022	032	So Phinees the priest and the princes departed from the children of Ruben, and from the children of Gad, and from the half tribe of Manasse out of Galaad into the land of Chanaan to the children of Israel; and reported the words to them.
006	JOS	022	033	And it pleased the children of Israel; and they spoke to the children of Israel, and blessed the God of the children of Israel, and told them to go up no more to war against the others to destroy the land of the children of Ruben, and the children of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasse: so they dwelt upon it.
006	JOS	022	034	And Joshua gave a name to the altar of the children of Ruben, and the children of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasse; and said, It is a testimony in the midst of them, that the Lord is their God.
006	JOS	023	001	And it came to pass after many days after the Lord had given Israel rest from all his enemies round about, that Joshua was old and advanced in years.
006	JOS	023	002	And Joshua called together all the children of Israel, and their elders, and their chiefs, and their judges, and their officers; and said to them, I am old and advanced in years.
006	JOS	023	003	And ye have seen all that the Lord our God has done to all these nations before us; [for it] is the Lord your God who has fought for you.
006	JOS	023	004	See, that I have given to you these nations that are left to you by lots to your tribes, all the nations beginning at Jordan; and [some] I have destroyed; and the boundaries shall be at the great sea westward.
006	JOS	023	005	And the Lord our God, he shall destroy them before us, until they utterly perish; and he shall send against them the wild beasts, until he shall have utterly destroyed them and their kings from before you; and ye shall inherit their land, as the Lord our God said to you.
006	JOS	023	006	Do ye therefore strive diligently to observe and do all things written in the book of the law of Moses, that ye turn not to the right hand or to the left;
006	JOS	023	007	that ye go not in among these nations that are left; and the names of their gods shall not be named among you, neither shall ye serve them, neither shall ye bow down to them.
006	JOS	023	008	But ye shall cleave to the Lord our God, as ye have done until this day.
006	JOS	023	009	And the Lord shall destroy them before you, [even] great and strong nations; and no one has stood before us until this day.
006	JOS	023	010	One of you has chased a thousand, for the Lord our God, he fought for you, as he said to us.
006	JOS	023	011	And take ye great heed to love the Lord our God.
006	JOS	023	012	For if ye shall turn aside and attach yourselves to these nations that are left with you, and make marriages with them, and become mingled with them and they with you,
006	JOS	023	013	know that the Lord will no more destroy these nations from before you; and they will be to you snares and stumbling-blocks, and nails in your heels, and darts in your eyes, until ye be destroyed from off this good land, which the Lord your God has given you.
006	JOS	023	014	But I hasten to go the way [of death], as all that are upon the earth also [do]: and ye know in your heart and in your soul, that not one word has fallen [to the ground] of all the words which the Lord our God has spoken respecting all that concerns us; there has not one of them failed.
006	JOS	023	015	And it shall come to pass, that as all the good things are come upon us which the Lord God will bring upon you all the evil things, until he shall have destroyed you from off this good land, which the Lord has given you,
006	JOS	023	016	when ye transgress the covenant of the Lord our God, which he has charged us, and go and serve other gods, and bow down to them.
006	JOS	024	001	And Joshua gathered all the tribe of Israel to Selo, and convoked their elders, and their officers, and their judges, and set them before God.
006	JOS	024	002	And Joshua said to all the people, Thus says the Lord God of Israel, Your fathers at first sojourned beyond the river, [even] Thara, the father of Abraam and the father of Nachor; and they served other gods.
006	JOS	024	003	And I took your father Abraam from the other side of the river, and I guided him through all the land, and I multiplied his seed;
006	JOS	024	004	and I gave to him Isaac, and to Isaac Jacob and Esau: and I gave to Esau mount Seir for him to inherit: and Jacob and his sons went down to Egypt, and became there a great and populous and mighty nation: and the Egyptians afflicted them.
006	JOS	024	005	And I smote Egypt with the wonders that I wrought among them.
006	JOS	024	006	And afterwards [God] brought out our fathers from Egypt, and ye entered into the Red Sea; and the Egyptians pursued after our fathers with chariots and horses into the Red Sea.
006	JOS	024	007	And we cried aloud to the Lord; and he put a cloud and darkness between us and the Egyptians, and he brought the sea upon them, and covered them; and your eyes have seen all that the Lord did in the land of Egypt; and ye were in the wilderness many days.
006	JOS	024	008	And he brought us into the land of the Amorites that dwelt beyond Jordan, and the Lord delivered them into our hands; and ye inherited their land, and utterly destroyed them from before you.
006	JOS	024	009	And Balac, king of Moab, son of Sepphor, rose up, and made war against Israel, and sent and called Balaam to curse us.
006	JOS	024	010	But the Lord thy God would not destroy thee; and he greatly blessed us, and rescued us out of their hands, and delivered them [to us].
006	JOS	024	011	And ye crossed over Jordan, and came to Jericho; and the inhabitants of Jericho fought against us, the Amorite, and the Chananite, and the Pherezite, and the Evite, and the Jebusite, and the Chettite, and the Gergesite, and the Lord delivered them into our hands.
006	JOS	024	012	And he sent forth the hornet before you; and he drove them out from before you, [even] twelve kings of the Amorites, not with thy sword, nor with thy bow.
006	JOS	024	013	And he gave you a land on which ye did not labour, and cities which ye did not build, and ye were settled in them; and ye eat [of] vineyards and oliveyards which ye did not plant.
006	JOS	024	014	And now fear the Lord, and serve him in righteousness and justice; and remove the strange gods, which our fathers served beyond the river, and in Egypt; and serve the Lord.
006	JOS	024	015	But if it seem not good to you to serve the Lord, choose to yourselves this day whom ye will serve, whether the gods of your fathers that were on the other side of the river, or the gods of the Amorites, among whom ye dwell upon their land: but I and my house will serve the Lord, for he is holy.
006	JOS	024	016	And the people answered and said, Far be it from us to forsake the Lord, so as to serve other gods.
006	JOS	024	017	The Lord our God, he is God; he brought up us and our fathers from Egypt, and kept us in all the way wherein we walked, and among all the nations through whom we passed.
006	JOS	024	018	And the Lord cast out the Amorite, and all the nations that inhabited the land from before us: yea, we will serve the Lord, for he is our God.
006	JOS	024	019	And Joshua said to the people, Indeed ye will not be able to serve the Lord, for God is holy; and he being jealous will not forgive your sins and your transgressions.
006	JOS	024	020	Whensoever ye shall forsake the Lord and serve other gods, then he shall come upon you and afflict you, and consume you, because he has done you good.
006	JOS	024	021	And the people said to Joshua, Nay, but we will serve the Lord.
006	JOS	024	022	And Joshua said to the people, Ye [are] witnesses against yourselves, that ye have chosen the Lord to serve him.
006	JOS	024	023	And now take away the strange gods that are among you, and set your heart right toward the Lord God of Israel.
006	JOS	024	024	And the people said to Joshua, We will serve the Lord, and we will hearken to his voice.
006	JOS	024	025	So Joshua made a covenant with the people on that day, and gave them a law and an ordinance in Selo before the tabernacle of the God of Israel.
006	JOS	024	026	And he wrote these words in the book of the laws of God: and Joshua took a great stone, and set it up under the oak before the Lord.
006	JOS	024	027	And Joshua said to the people, Behold, this stone shall be among you for a witness, for it has heard all the words that have been spoken to it by the Lord; for he has spoken to you this day; and this [stone] shall be among you for a witness in the last days, whenever ye shall deal falsely with the Lord my God.
006	JOS	024	028	And Joshua dismissed the people, and they went every man to his place.
006	JOS	024	029	And it came to pass after these things that Joshua the son of Naue the servant of the Lord died, [at the age] of a hundred and ten years.
006	JOS	024	030	And they buried him by the borders of his inheritance in Thamnasarach in the mount of Ephraim, northward of the mount of Galaad: there they put with him into the tomb in which they buried him, the knives of stone with which he circumcised the children of Israel in Galgala, when he brought them out of Egypt, as the Lord appointed them; and there they are to this day.
006	JOS	024	031	And Israel served the Lord all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that lived as long as Joshua, and all that knew all the works of the Lord which he wrought for Israel.
006	JOS	024	032	And the children of Israel brought up the bones of Joseph out of Egypt, and buried [them] in Sicima, in the portion of the land which Jacob bought of the Amorites who dwelt in Sicima for a hundred ewe-lambs; and he gave it to Joseph for a portion.
006	JOS	024	033	And it came to pass afterwards that Eleazar the high-priest the son of Aaron died, and was buried in Gabaar of Phinees his son, which he gave him in mount Ephraim. In that day the children of Israel took the ark of God, and carried it about among them; and Phinees exercised the priest's office in the room of Eleazar his father till he died, and he was buried in his own place Gabaar: but the children of Israel departed every one to their place, and to their own city: and the children of Israel worshipped Astarte, and Astaroth, and the gods of the nations round about them; and the Lord delivered them into the hands of Eglom king of Moab and he ruled over them eighteen years.

# BOOK	007	JDG	Judges	Judges
007	JDG	001	001	And it came to pass after the death of Joshua, that the children of Israel enquired of the Lord, saying, Who shall go up for us first against the Chananites, to fight against them?
007	JDG	001	002	And the Lord said, Judas shall go up: behold, I have delivered the land into his hand.
007	JDG	001	003	And Judas said to his brother Symeon, Come up with me into my lot, and let us array ourselves against the Chananites, and I also will go with thee into thy lot: and Symeon went with him.
007	JDG	001	004	And Judas went up; and the Lord delivered the Chananite and the Pherezite into their hands, and they smote them in Bezek to [the number of] ten thousand men.
007	JDG	001	005	And they overtook Adonibezek in Bezek, and fought against him; and they smote the Chananite and the Pherezite.
007	JDG	001	006	And Adonibezek fled, and they pursued after him, and took him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.
007	JDG	001	007	And Adonibezek said, Seventy kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered [their food] under my table: as I therefore have done, so God has recompensed me: and they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there.
007	JDG	001	008	And the children of Judas fought against Jerusalem, and took it, and smote with the edge of the sword, and they burnt the city with fire.
007	JDG	001	009	And afterwards the children of Judas went down to fight with the Chananite dwelling in the hill country, and the south, and the plain country.
007	JDG	001	010	And Judas went to the Chananite who dwelt in Chebron; and Chebron came out against him; [and the name of Chebron before was Cariatharbocsepher:] and they smote Sessi, and Achiman, and Tholmi, children of Enac.
007	JDG	001	011	And they went up thence to the inhabitants of Dabir; but the name of Dabir was before Cariathsepher, the city of Letters.
007	JDG	001	012	And Chaleb said, Whosoever shall smite the city of Letters, and shall first take it, I will give to him Ascha my daughter to wife.
007	JDG	001	013	And Gothoniel the younger son of Kenez the brother of Chaleb took it; and Chaleb gave him his daughter Ascha to wife.
007	JDG	001	014	And it came to pass as she went in, that Gothoniel urged her to ask a field of her father; and she murmured and cried from off her ass, Thou hast sent me forth into a south land: and Chaleb said to her, What is thy request?
007	JDG	001	015	And Ascha said to him, Give me, I pray thee, a blessing, for thou hast sent me forth into a south land, and thou shalt give me the ransom of water: and Chaleb gave her according to her heart the ransom of the upper [springs] and the ransom of the low [springs].
007	JDG	001	016	And the children of Jothor the Kenite the father-in-law of Moses went up from the city of palm-trees with the children of Judas, to the wilderness that is in the south of Juda, which is at the descent of Arad, and they dwelt with the people.
007	JDG	001	017	And Judas went with Symeon his brother, and smote the Chananite that inhabited Sepheth, and they utterly destroyed them; and they called the name of the city Anathema.
007	JDG	001	018	But Judas did not inherit Gaza nor her coasts, nor Ascalon nor her coasts, nor Accaron nor her coasts, [nor] Azotus nor the lands around it.
007	JDG	001	019	And the Lord was with Judas, and he inherited the mountain; for they were not able to destroy the inhabitants of the valley, for Rechab prevented them.
007	JDG	001	020	And they gave Chebron to Chaleb, as Moses said; and thence he inherited the three cities of the children of Enac.
007	JDG	001	021	But the children of Benjamin did not take the inheritance of the Jebusite who dwelt in Jerusalem; and the Jebusite dwelt with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem until this day.
007	JDG	001	022	And the sons of Joseph, they also went up to Baethel; and the Lord was with them.
007	JDG	001	023	And they encamped and surveyed Baethel: and the name of the city before was Luza.
007	JDG	001	024	And the spies looked, and behold, a man went out of the city, and they took him; and they said to him, Shew us the way into the city, and we will deal mercifully with thee.
007	JDG	001	025	And he shewed them the way into the city; and they smote the city with the edge of the sword; but they let go the man and his family.
007	JDG	001	026	And the man went into the land of Chettin, and built there a city, and called the name of it Luza; this [is] its name until this day.
007	JDG	001	027	And Manasse did not drive out [the inhabitants of] Baethsan, which is a city of Scythians, nor her towns, nor her suburbs; nor Thanac, nor her towns; nor the inhabitants of Dor, nor her suburbs, nor her towns; nor the inhabitant of Balac, nor her suburbs, nor her towns; nor the inhabitants of Magedo, nor her suburbs, nor her towns; nor the inhabitants of Jeblaam, nor her suburbs, nor her towns; and the Chananite began to dwell in this land.
007	JDG	001	028	And it came to pass when Israel was strong, that he made the Chananite tributary, but did not utterly drive them out.
007	JDG	001	029	And Ephraim did not drive out the Chananite that dwelt in Gazer; and the Chananite dwelt in the midst of him in Gazer, and became tributary.
007	JDG	001	030	And Zabulon did not drive out the inhabitants of Kedron, nor the inhabitants of Domana: and the Chananite dwelt in the midst of them, and became tributary to them.
007	JDG	001	031	And Aser did not drive out the inhabitants of Accho, and [that people] became tributary to him, nor the inhabitants of Dor, nor the inhabitants of Sidon, nor the inhabitants of Dalaph, nor Aschazi, nor Chebda, nor Nai, nor Ereo.
007	JDG	001	032	And Aser dwelt in the midst of the Chananite who inhabited the land, for he could not drive him out.
007	JDG	001	033	And Nephthali did not drive out the inhabitants of Baethsamys, nor the inhabitants of Baethanach; and Nephthali dwelt in the midst of the Chananite who inhabited the land: but the inhabitants of Bethsamys and of Baetheneth became tributary to them.
007	JDG	001	034	And the Amorite drove out the children of Dan into the mountains, for they did not suffer them to come down into the valley.
007	JDG	001	035	And the Amorite began to dwell in the mountain of shells, in which [are] bears, and foxes, in Myrsinon, and in Thalabin; and the hand of the house of Joseph was heavy upon the Amorite, and he became tributary to them.
007	JDG	001	036	And the border of the Amorite [was] from the going up of Acrabin, from the rock and upwards.
007	JDG	002	001	And an angel of the Lord went up from Galgal to the [place of] weeping, and to Baethel, and to the house of Israel, and said to them, Thus says the Lord, I brought you up out of Egypt, and I brought you into the land which I sware to your fathers; and I said, I will never break my covenant that I have made with you.
007	JDG	002	002	And ye shall make no covenant with them that dwell in this land, neither shall ye worship their gods; but ye shall destroy their graven images, ye shall pull down their altars: but ye hearkened not to my voice, for ye did these things.
007	JDG	002	003	And I said, I will not drive them out from before you, but they shall be for a distress to you, and their gods shall be to you for an offence.
007	JDG	002	004	And it came to pass when the angel of the Lord spoke these words to all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice, and wept.
007	JDG	002	005	And they named the name of that place Weepings; and they sacrificed there to the Lord.
007	JDG	002	006	And Joshua dismissed the people, and they went every man to his inheritance, to inherit the land.
007	JDG	002	007	And the people served the Lord all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that lived many days with Joshua, as many as knew all the great work of the Lord, what things he had wrought in Israel.
007	JDG	002	008	And Joshua the son of Naue, the servant of the Lord, died, a hundred and ten years old.
007	JDG	002	009	And they buried him in the border of his inheritance, in Thamnathares, in mount Ephraim, on the north of the mountain of Gaas.
007	JDG	002	010	And all that generation were laid to their fathers: and another generation rose up after them, who knew not the Lord, nor yet the work which he wrought in Israel.
007	JDG	002	011	And the children of Israel wrought evil before the Lord, and served Baalim.
007	JDG	002	012	And they forsook the Lord God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and walked after other gods, of the gods of the nations round about them; and they worshipped them.
007	JDG	002	013	And they provoked the Lord, and forsook him, and served Baal and the Astartes.
007	JDG	002	014	And the Lord was very angry with Israel; and he gave them into the hands of the spoilers, and they spoiled them; and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about, and they could not any longer resist their enemies,
007	JDG	002	015	among whomsoever they went; and the hand of the Lord was against them for evil, as the Lord spoke, and as the Lord sware to them; and he greatly afflicted them.
007	JDG	002	016	And the Lord raised up judges, and the Lord save them out of the hands of them that spoiled them: and yet they hearkened not to the judges,
007	JDG	002	017	for they went a whoring after other gods, and worshipped them; and they turned quickly out of the way in which their fathers walked to hearken to the words of the Lord; they did not so.
007	JDG	002	018	And because the Lord raised them up judges, so the Lord was with the judge, and saved them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge; for the Lord was moved at their groaning by reason of them that besieged them and afflicted them.
007	JDG	002	019	And it came to pass when the judge died, that they went back, and again corrupted [themselves] worse than their fathers to go after other gods to serve them an to worship them: they abandoned not their devices nor their stubborn ways.
007	JDG	002	020	And the Lord was very angry with Israel, and said, Forasmuch as this nation has forsaken my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and has not hearkened to my voice,
007	JDG	002	021	therefore I will not any more cast out a man of the nations before their face, which Joshua the son of Naue left in the land. And [the Lord] left [them],
007	JDG	002	022	to prove Israel with them, whether they would keep the way of the Lord, to walk in it, as their fathers kept it, or no.
007	JDG	002	023	So the Lord will leave these nations, so as not to cast them out suddenly; and he delivered them not into the hand of Joshua.
007	JDG	003	001	And these [are] the nations which the Lord left to prove Israel with them, all that had not known the wars of Chanaan.
007	JDG	003	002	Only for the sake of the generations of Israel, to teach them war, only the men before them knew them not.
007	JDG	003	003	The five lordships of the Phylistines, and every Chananite, and the Sidonian, and the Evite who dwelt in Libanus from the mount of Aermon to Laboemath.
007	JDG	003	004	And [this] was done in order to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would obey the commands of the Lord, which he charged their fathers by the hand of Moses.
007	JDG	003	005	And the children of Israel dwelt in the midst of the Chananite, and the Chettite, and the Amorite, and the Pherezite, and the Evite, and the Jebusite.
007	JDG	003	006	And they took their daughters for wives to themselves, and they gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods.
007	JDG	003	007	And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord, and forgot the Lord their God, and served Baalim and the groves.
007	JDG	003	008	And the Lord was very angry with Israel, and sold them into the hand of Chusarsathaim king of Syria of the rivers: and the children of Israel served Chusarsathaim eight years.
007	JDG	003	009	And the children of Israel cried to the Lord; and the Lord raised up a saviour to Israel, and he saved them, Gothoniel the son of Kenez, the brother of Chaleb younger than himself.
007	JDG	003	010	And the Spirit of the Lord came upon him, and he judged Israel; and he went out to war against Chusarsathaim: and the Lord delivered into his hand Chusarsathaim king of Syria of the rivers, and his hand prevailed against Chusarsathaim.
007	JDG	003	011	And the land was quiet forty years; and Gothoniel the son of Kenez died.
007	JDG	003	012	And the children of Israel continued to do evil before the Lord: and the Lord strengthened Eglom king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil before the Lord.
007	JDG	003	013	And he gathered to himself all the children of Ammon and Amalec, and went and smote Israel, and took possession of the city of Palm-trees.
007	JDG	003	014	And the children of Israel served Eglom the king of Moab eighteen years.
007	JDG	003	015	And the children of Israel cried to the Lord; and he raised up to them a saviour, Aod the son of Gera a son of Jemeni, a man who used both hands alike: and the children of Israel sent gifts by his hand to Eglom king of Moab.
007	JDG	003	016	And Aod made himself a dagger of two edges, of a span long, and he girded it under his cloak upon his right thigh.
007	JDG	003	017	And he went, and brought the presents to Eglom king of Moab, and Eglom [was] a very handsome man.
007	JDG	003	018	And it came to pass when [Aod] had made an end of offering his gifts, that he dismissed those that brought the gifts.
007	JDG	003	019	And he himself returned from the quarries that are by Galgal; and Aod said, I have a secret errand to thee, O king! and Eglom said to him, Be silent: and he sent away from his presence all who waited upon him.
007	JDG	003	020	And Aod went in to him; and he sat in his own upper summer chamber quite alone; and Aod said, I have a message from God to thee, O king: and Eglom rose up from his throne near him.
007	JDG	003	021	And it came to pass as he arose, that Aod stretched forth his left hand, and took the dagger off his right thigh, and plunged it into his belly;
007	JDG	003	022	and drove in also the haft after the blade, and the fat closed in upon the blade, for he drew not out the dagger from his belly.
007	JDG	003	023	And Aod went out to the porch, and passed out by the appointed [guards], and shut the doors of the chamber upon him, and locked [them].
007	JDG	003	024	And he went out: and Eglom's servants came, and saw, and behold, the doors of the upper chamber [were] locked; and they said, Does he not uncover his feet in the summer-chamber?
007	JDG	003	025	And they waited till they were ashamed, and, behold, there was no one that opened the doors of the upper chamber; and they took the key, and opened them; and, behold, their lord was fallen down dead upon the earth.
007	JDG	003	026	And Aod escaped while they were in a tumult, and no one paid attention to him; and he passed the quarries, and escaped to Setirotha.
007	JDG	003	027	And it came to pass when Aod came into the land of Israel, that he blew the horn in mount Ephraim, and the children of Israel came down with him from the mountain, and he [was] before them.
007	JDG	003	028	And he said to them, Come down after me, for the Lord God has delivered our enemies, even Moab, into our hand; and they went down after him, and seized on the fords of Jordan before Moab, and he did not suffer a man to pass over.
007	JDG	003	029	And they smote Moab on that day about ten thousand men, every [lusty] person and every mighty man; and not a man escaped.
007	JDG	003	030	So Moab was humbled in that day under the hand of Israel, and the land had rest eighty years; and Aod judged them till he died.
007	JDG	003	031	And after him rose up Samegar the son of Dinach, and smote the Philistines to the number of six hundred men with a ploughshare [such as is drawn by] oxen; and he too delivered Israel.
007	JDG	004	001	And the children of Israel continued to do evil against the Lord; and Aod was dead.
007	JDG	004	002	And the Lord sold the children of Israel into the hand of Jabin king of Chanaan, who ruled in Asor; and the chief of his host was Sisara, and he dwelt in Arisoth of the Gentiles.
007	JDG	004	003	And the children of Israel cried to the Lord, because he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and he mightily oppressed Israel twenty years.
007	JDG	004	004	And Debbora, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, —she judged Israel at that time.
007	JDG	004	005	And she sat under the palm-tree of Debbora between Rama and Baethel in mount Ephraim; and the children of Israel went up to her for judgment.
007	JDG	004	006	And Debbora sent and called Barac the son of Abineem out of Cades Nephthali, and she said to him, Has not the Lord God of Israel commanded thee? and thou shalt depart to mount Thabor, and shalt take with thyself ten thousand men of the sons of Nephthali and of the sons of Zabulon.
007	JDG	004	007	And I will bring to thee to the torrent of Kison Sisara the captain of the host of Jabin, and his chariots, and his multitude, and I will deliver them into thine hands.
007	JDG	004	008	And Barac said to her, If thou wilt go with me, I will go; and if thou wilt not go, I will not go; for I know not the day on which the Lord prospers his messenger with me.
007	JDG	004	009	And she said, I will surely go with thee; but know that thy honour shall not attend on the expedition on which thou goest, for the Lord shall sell Sisara into the hands of a women: and Debbora arose, and went with Barac out of Cades.
007	JDG	004	010	And Barac called Zabulon and Nephthali out of Cades, and there went up at his feet ten thousand men, and Debbora went up with him.
007	JDG	004	011	And Chaber the Kenite had removed from Caina, from the sons of Jobab the father-in-law of Moses, and pitched his tent by the oak of the covetous ones, which is near Kedes.
007	JDG	004	012	And it was told Sisara that Barac the son of Abineem was gone up to mount Thabor.
007	JDG	004	013	And Sisara summoned all his chariots, nine hundred chariots of iron and all the people with him, from Arisoth of the Gentiles to the brook of Kison.
007	JDG	004	014	And Debbora said to Barac, Rise up, for this [is] the day on which the Lord has delivered Sisara into thy hand, for the Lord shall go forth before thee: and Barac went down from mount Thabor, and ten thousand men after him.
007	JDG	004	015	And the Lord discomfited Sisara, and all his chariots, and all his army, with the edge of the sword before Barac: and Sisara descended from off his chariot, and fled on his feet.
007	JDG	004	016	And Barac pursued after the chariots and after the army, into Arisoth of the Gentiles; and the whole army of Sisara fell by the edge of the sword, there was not one left.
007	JDG	004	017	And Sisara fled on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Chaber the Kenite his friend: for there was peace between Jabin king of Asor and the house of Chaber the Kenite.
007	JDG	004	018	And Jael went, out to meet Sisara, and said to him, Turn aside, my lord, turn aside to me, fear not: and he turned aside to her into the tent; and she covered him with a mantle.
007	JDG	004	019	And Sisara said to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink, for I am thirsty: and she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him to drink, and covered him.
007	JDG	004	020	And Sisara said to her, Stand now by the door of the tent, and it shall come to pass if any man come to thee, and ask of thee, and say, Is there [any] man here? then thou shalt say, There is not.
007	JDG	004	021	And Jael the wife of Chaber took a pin of the tent, and took a hammer in her hand, and went secretly to him, and fastened the pin in his temple, and it went through to the earth, and he fainted away, and darkness fell upon him and he died.
007	JDG	004	022	And, behold, Barac [was] pursuing Sisara: and Jael went out to meet him, and he said to him, Come, and I will shew thee the man whom thou seekest: and he went in to her; and, behold, Sisara was fallen dead, and the pin [was] in his temple.
007	JDG	004	023	So God routed Jabin king of Chanaan in that day before the children of Israel.
007	JDG	004	024	And the hand of the children of Israel prevailed more and more against Jabin king of Chanaan, until they utterly destroyed Jabin king of Chanaan.
007	JDG	005	001	And Debbora and Barac son of Abineem sang in that day, saying,
007	JDG	005	002	A revelation was made in Israel when the people were made willing: Praise ye the Lord.
007	JDG	005	003	Hear, ye kings, and hearken, rulers: I will sing, it is I [who will sing] to the Lord, it is I, I will sing a psalm to the Lord the god of Israel.
007	JDG	005	004	O Lord, in thy going forth on Seir, when thou wentest forth out of the land of Edom, the earth quaked and the heaven dropped dews, and the clouds dropped water.
007	JDG	005	005	The mountains were shaken before the face of the Lord Eloi, this Sina before the face of the Lord God of Israel.
007	JDG	005	006	In the days of Samegar son of Anath, in the days of Jael, they deserted the ways, and went in by-ways; they went in crooked paths.
007	JDG	005	007	The mighty men in Israel failed, they failed until Debbora arose, until she arose a mother in Israel.
007	JDG	005	008	They chose new gods; then the cities of rulers fought; there was not a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel.
007	JDG	005	009	My heart [inclines] to the orders given in Israel; ye that are willing among the people, bless the Lord.
007	JDG	005	010	Ye that mount a she-ass at noon-day, ye that sit on the judgment-seat, and walk by the roads of them that sit in judgment by the way; declare
007	JDG	005	011	[ye that are delivered] from the noise of disturbers among the drawers of water; there shall they relate righteous acts: O Lord, increase righteous acts in Israel: then the people of the Lord went down to the cities.
007	JDG	005	012	Awake, awake, Debbora; awake, awake, utter a song: arise, Barac, and lead thy captivity captive, son of Abineem.
007	JDG	005	013	Then went down the remnant to the strong, the people of the Lord went down for him among the mighty ones from me.
007	JDG	005	014	Ephraim rooted them out in Amalec, behind thee was Benjamin among thy people: the inhabitants of Machir came down with me searching out the enemy, and from Zabulon came they that draw with the scribe's pen of record.
007	JDG	005	015	And princess in Issachar were with Debbora and Barac, thus she sent Barac on his feet in the valleys into the portions of Ruben; great [pangs] reached to the heart.
007	JDG	005	016	Why did they sit between the sheep-folds to hear the bleating of flocks for the divisions of Ruben? [there were] great searchings of heart.
007	JDG	005	017	Galaad [is] on the other side of Jordan where he pitched his tents; and why does Dan remain in ships? Aser sat down on the sea-coasts, and he will tabernacle at his ports.
007	JDG	005	018	The people Zabulon exposed their soul to death, and Nephthali came to the high places of their land.
007	JDG	005	019	Kings set themselves in array, then the kings of Chanaan fought in Thanaach at the water of Mageddo; they took no gift of money.
007	JDG	005	020	The stars from heaven set themselves in array, they set themselves [to fight] with Sisara out of their paths.
007	JDG	005	021	The brook of Kison swept them away, the ancient brook, the brook Kison: my mighty soul will trample him down.
007	JDG	005	022	When the hoofs of the horse were entangled, his mighty ones earnestly hasted
007	JDG	005	023	to curse Meroz: Curse ye [it], said the angel of the Lord; cursed [is] every one that dwells in it, because they came not to the help of the Lord, to his help among the mighty.
007	JDG	005	024	Blessed among women be Jael wife of Chaber the Kenite; let her be blessed above women in tents.
007	JDG	005	025	He asked for water, she gave him milk in a dish; she brought butter of princes.
007	JDG	005	026	She stretched forth her left hand to the nail, and her right to the hand workman's hammer, and she smote Sisara with it, she nailed through his head and smote him; she nailed through his temples.
007	JDG	005	027	He rolled down between her feet; he fell and lay between her feet; he bowed and fell: where he bowed, there he fell dead.
007	JDG	005	028	The mother of Sisara looked down through the window out of the loophole, [saying], Why was his chariot ashamed? why did the wheels of his chariots tarry?
007	JDG	005	029	Her wise ladies answered her, and she returned answers to herself, [saying],
007	JDG	005	030	Will they not find him dividing the spoil? he will surely be gracious to every man: [there are] spoils of dyed garments for Sisara, spoils of various dyed garments, dyed embroidered garments, they [are] the spoils for his neck.
007	JDG	005	031	Thus let all thine enemies perish, O Lord: and they that love him shall be as the going forth of the sun in his strength. And the land had rest forty years.
007	JDG	006	001	And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord, and the Lord gave them into the hand of Madiam seven years.
007	JDG	006	002	And the hand of Madiam prevailed against Israel: and the children of Israel made for themselves because of Madiam the caves in the mountains, and the dens, and the holes in the rocks.
007	JDG	006	003	And it came to pass when the children of Israel sowed, that Madiam and Amalec went up, and the children of the east went up together with them.
007	JDG	006	004	And they encamped against them, and destroyed their fruits until they came to Gaza; and they left not the support of life in the land of Israel, not even ox or ass among the herds.
007	JDG	006	005	For they and their stock came up, and their tents were with them, as the locust in multitude, and there was no number to them and their camels; and they came to the land of Israel, and laid it waste.
007	JDG	006	006	And Israel was greatly impoverished because of Madiam.
007	JDG	006	007	And the children of Israel cried to the Lord because of Madiam.
007	JDG	006	008	And the Lord sent a prophet to the children of Israel; and he said to them, Thus says the Lord God of Israel, I am he that brought you up out of the land of Egypt, and I brought you up out of the house of your bondage.
007	JDG	006	009	And I delivered you out of the hand of Egypt, and out of the hand of all that afflicted you, and I cast them out before you; and I gave you their land.
007	JDG	006	010	And I said to you, I [am] the Lord your God: ye shall not fear the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell; but ye hearkened not to my voice.
007	JDG	006	011	And an angel of the Lord came, and sat down under the fir tree, which was in Ephratha in the land of Joas father of Esdri; and Gedeon his son [was] threshing wheat in a wine-press in order to escape from the face of Madiam.
007	JDG	006	012	And the angel of the Lord appeared to him and said to him, The Lord [is] with thee, thou mighty in strength.
007	JDG	006	013	And Gedeon said to him, [Be gracious] with me, my Lord: but if the Lord is with us, why have these evils found us? and where are all his miracles, which our fathers have related to us, saying, Did not the Lord bring us up out of Egypt? and now he has cast us out, and given us into the hand of Madiam.
007	JDG	006	014	And the angel of the Lord turned to him, and said, Go in this thy strength, and thou shalt save Israel out of the hand of Madiam: behold, I have sent thee.
007	JDG	006	015	And Gedeon said to him, [Be gracious] with me, my Lord: whereby shall I save Israel? behold, my thousand is weakened in Manasse, and I am the least in my father's house.
007	JDG	006	016	And the angel of the Lord said to him, The Lord shall be with thee, and thou shalt smite Madiam as one man.
007	JDG	006	017	And Gedeon said to him, If now I have found mercy in thine eyes, and thou wilt do this day for me all that thou hast spoken of with me,
007	JDG	006	018	depart not hence until I come to thee, and I will bring forth an offering and offer it before thee: and he said, I will remain until thou return.
007	JDG	006	019	And Gedeon went in, and prepared a kid of the goats, and an ephah of fine flour unleavened; and he put the flesh in the basket, and poured the broth into the pot, and brought them forth to him under the turpentine tree, and drew nigh.
007	JDG	006	020	And the angel of God said to him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and put them on that rock, and pour out the broth close by: and he did so.
007	JDG	006	021	And the angel of the Lord stretched out the end of the rod that was in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened bread; and fire came up out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened bread, and the angel of the Lord vanished from his sight.
007	JDG	006	022	And Gedeon saw that he was an angel of the Lord; and Gedeon said, Ah, ah, Lord my God! for I have seen the angel of the Lord face to face.
007	JDG	006	023	And the Lord said to him, Peace be to thee, fear not, thou shalt not die.
007	JDG	006	024	And Gedeon built there an altar to the Lord, and called it The peace of the Lord, until this day, as it is still inEphratha of the father of Esdri.
007	JDG	006	025	And it came to pass in that night, that the Lord said to him, Take the young bullock which thy father has, even the second bullock of seven years old, and thou shalt destroy the altar of Baal which thy father has, and the grove which is by itthou shalt destroy.
007	JDG	006	026	And thou shalt build an altar to the Lord thy God on the top of this Maozi in the ordering[it], and thou shalt take the second bullock, and shalt offer up whole-burnt-offerings with the wood of the grove, which thou shalt destroy.
007	JDG	006	027	And Gedeon took ten men of his servants, and did as the Lord spoke to him: and it came to pass, as he feared the house of his father and the men of the city if he should do it by day, that he did it by night.
007	JDG	006	028	And the men of the city rose up early in the morning; and behold, the altar of Baal had been demolished, and the grove by it had been destroyed; and they saw the second bullock, which Gedeon offered on the altar that had been built.
007	JDG	006	029	And a man said to his neighbour, Who has done this thing? and they enquired and searched, and learnt that Gedeon the son of Joas had done this thing.
007	JDG	006	030	And the men of the city said to Joas, Bring out thy son, and let him die, because he has destroyed the altar of Baal, and because he has destroyed the grove that is by it.
007	JDG	006	031	And Gedeon the son of Joas said to all the men who rose up against him, Do ye now plead for Baal, or will ye save him? whoever will plead for him, let him be slain this morning: if he be a god let him plead for himself, [because] one has thrown down his altar.
007	JDG	006	032	And he called it in that day Jerobaal, saying, Let Baal plead thereby, because his altar has been thrown down.
007	JDG	006	033	And all Madiam, and Amalek, and the sons of the east gathered themselves together, and encamped in the valley of Jezrael.
007	JDG	006	034	And the Spirit of the Lord came upon Gedeon, and he blew with the horn, and Abiezer came to help after him.
007	JDG	006	035	And [Gedeon] sent messengers into all Manasse, and into Aser, and into Zabulon, and into Nephthali; and he went up to meet them.
007	JDG	006	036	And Gedeon said to God, If thou wilt save Israel by my hand, as thou hast said,
007	JDG	006	037	behold, I put the fleece of wool in the threshing-floor: if there be dew on the fleece only, and drought on all the ground, I shall know that thou wilt save Israel by my hand, as thou hast said.
007	JDG	006	038	And it was so: and he rose up early in the morning, and wrung the fleece, and dew dropped from the fleece, a bowl full of water.
007	JDG	006	039	And Gedeon said to God, Let not, I pray thee, thine anger be kindled with me, and I will speak yet once; I will even yet make one trial more with the fleece: let now the drought be upon the fleece only, and let there be dew on all the ground.
007	JDG	006	040	And God did so in that night; and there was drought on the fleece only, and on all the ground there was dew.
007	JDG	007	001	And Jerobaal rose early, the same is Gedeon, and all the people with him, and encamped at the fountain of Arad; and the camp of Madiam was to the north of him, [reaching] from Gabaathamorai, in the valley.
007	JDG	007	002	And the Lord said to Gedeon, The people with thee [are] many, so that I may not deliver Madiam into their hand, lest at any time Israel boast against me, saying, My hand has saved me.
007	JDG	007	003	And now speak in the ears of the people, saying, Who [is] afraid and fearful? let him turn and depart from mount Galaad: and there returned of the people twenty-two thousand, and ten thousand were left.
007	JDG	007	004	And the Lord said to Gedeon, The people is yet numerous; bring them down to the water, and I will purge them there for thee: and it shall come to pass that of whomsoever I shall say to thee, This one shall go with thee, [even] he shall go with thee; and of whomsoever I shall say to thee, This one shall not go with thee, [even] he shall not go with thee.
007	JDG	007	005	And he brought the people down to the water; and the Lord said to Gedeon, Whosoever shall lap of the water with his tongue as if a dog should lap, thou shalt set him apart, and [also] whosoever shall bow down upon his knees to drink.
007	JDG	007	006	And the number of those that lapped with their hand to their mouth was three hundred men; and all the rest of the people bowed upon their knees to drink water.
007	JDG	007	007	And the Lord said to Gedeon, I will save you by the three hundred men that lapped, and I will give Madiam into thy hand; and all the [rest of the] people shall go every one to his place.
007	JDG	007	008	And they took the provision of the people in their hand, and their horns; and he sent away every man of Israel each to his tent, and he strengthened the three hundred; and the army of Madiam were beneath him in the valley.
007	JDG	007	009	And it came to pass in that night that the Lord said to him, Arise, go down into the camp, for I have delivered it into thy hand.
007	JDG	007	010	And if thou art afraid to go down, go down thou and thy servant Phara into the camp.
007	JDG	007	011	And thou shalt hear what they shall say, and afterwards thy hands shall be strong, and thou shalt go down into the camp: and he went down and Phara his servant to the extremity of the [companies of] fifty, which were in the camp.
007	JDG	007	012	And Madiam and Amalec and all the children of the east [were] scattered in the valley, as the locust for multitude; and there was no number to their camels, but they were as the sand on the seashore for multitude.
007	JDG	007	013	And Gedeon came, and behold a man [was] relating to his neighbour a dream, and he said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream, and behold, a cake of barley bread rolling into the camp of Madiam, and it came as far as a tent, and smote it, and it fell, and it turned it up, and the tent fell.
007	JDG	007	014	And his neighbour answered and said, This is none other than the sword of Gedeon, son of Joas, a man of Israel: God has delivered Madiam and all the host into his hand.
007	JDG	007	015	And it came to pass when Gedeon heard the account of the dream and the interpretation of it, that he worshipped the Lord, and returned to the camp of Israel, and said, Rise, for the Lord has delivered the camp of Madiam into our hand.
007	JDG	007	016	And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and put horns in the hands of all, and empty pitchers, and torches in the pitchers:
007	JDG	007	017	and he said to them, Ye shall look at me, and so shall ye do; and behold, I will go into the beginning of the host, and it shall come to pass [that] as I do, so shall ye do.
007	JDG	007	018	And I will sound with the horn, and all ye with me shall sound with the horn round about the whole camp, and ye shall say, For the Lord and Gedeon.
007	JDG	007	019	And Gedeon and the hundred men that were with him came to the extremity of the army in the beginning of the middle watch; and they completely roused the guards, and sounded with the horns, and they broke the pitchers that were in their hands,
007	JDG	007	020	and the three companies sounded with the horns, and broke the pitchers, and held the torches in their left hands, and in their right hands their horns to sound with; and they cried out, A sword for the Lord and for Gedeon.
007	JDG	007	021	And [every] man stood in his place round about the host; and all the host ran, and sounded [an alarm], and fled.
007	JDG	007	022	And they sounded with the three hundred horns; and the Lord set [every] man's sword in all the host against his neighbour.
007	JDG	007	023	And the host fled as far as Bethseed Tagaragatha Abel-meula to Tabath; and the men of Israel from Nephthali, and from Aser, and from all Manasse, came to help, and followed after Madiam.
007	JDG	007	024	And Gedeon sent messengers into all mount Ephraim, saying, Come down to meet Madiam, and take to yourselves the water as far as Baethera and Jordan: and every man of Ephraim cried out, and they took the water before hand unto Baethera and Jordan.
007	JDG	007	025	And they took the princess of Madiam, even Oreb and Zeb; and they slew Oreb in Sur Oreb, and they slew Zeb in Jakephzeph; and they pursued Madiam, and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeb to Gedeon from beyond Jordan.
007	JDG	008	001	And the men of Ephraim said to Gedeon, What [is] this [that] thou hast done to us, in that thou didst not call us when thou wentest to fight with Madiam? and they chode with him sharply.
007	JDG	008	002	And he said to them, What have I now done in comparison of you? [is] not the gleaning of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?
007	JDG	008	003	The Lord has delivered into your hand the princes of Madiam, Oreb and Zeb; and what could I do in comparison of you? Then was their spirit calmed toward him, when he spoke this word.
007	JDG	008	004	And Gedeon came to Jordan, and went over, himself and the three hundred with him, hungry, yet pursuing.
007	JDG	008	005	And he said to the men of Socchoth, Give, I pray you, bread to feed this people that follow me; because they are faint, and behold, I am following after Zebee and Salmana, kings of Madiam.
007	JDG	008	006	And the princes of Socchoth said, [Are] the hands of Zebee and Salmana now in thy hand, that we should give bread to thy host?
007	JDG	008	007	And Gedeon said, Therefore when the Lord gives Zebee and Salmana into my hand, then will I tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness, and the Barkenim.
007	JDG	008	008	And he went up thence to Phanuel, and spoke to them likewise: and the men of Phanuel answered him as the men of Socchoth [had] answered him.
007	JDG	008	009	And Gedeon said to the men of Phanuel, When I return in peace, I will break down this tower.
007	JDG	008	010	And Zebee and Salmana [were] in Carcar, and their host [was] with them, about fifteen thousand, all that were left of all the host of the aliens; and they that fell [were] a hundred and twenty thousand men that drew the sword.
007	JDG	008	011	And Gedeon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents, eastward of Nabai and Jegebal; and he smote the host, and the host was secure.
007	JDG	008	012	And Zebee and Salmana fled; and he pursued after them, and took the two kings of Madiam, Zebee and Salmana, and discomfited all the army.
007	JDG	008	013	And Gedeon the son of Joas returned from the battle, down from the battle of Ares.
007	JDG	008	014	And he took prisoner a young lad of the men of Socchoth, and questioned him; and he wrote to him the names of the princes of Socchoth and of their elders, seventy-seven men.
007	JDG	008	015	And Gedeon came to the princes of Socchoth, and said, Behold Zebee and Salmana, about whom ye reproached me, saying, [Are] the hands of Zebee and Salmana now in thy hand, that we should give bread to thy men that are faint?
007	JDG	008	016	And he took the elders of the city with the thorns of the wilderness and the Barkenim, and with them he tore the men of the city.
007	JDG	008	017	And he overthrew the tower of Phanuel, and slew the men of the city.
007	JDG	008	018	And he said to Zebee and Salmana, Where [are] the men whom ye slew in Thabor? and they said, As thou, so [were] they, according to the likeness of the son of a king.
007	JDG	008	019	And Gedeon said, They were my brethren and the sons of my mother: [as] the Lord lives, if ye had preserved them alive, I would not have slain you.
007	JDG	008	020	And he said to Jether his first-born, Rise and slay them; but the lad drew not his sword, for he was afraid, for he was yet very young.
007	JDG	008	021	And Zebee and Salmana said, Rise thou and fall upon us, for thy power [is] as that of a man; and Gedeon arose, and slew Zebee and Salmana: and he took the round ornaments that were on the necks of their camels.
007	JDG	008	022	And the men of Israel said to Gedeon, Rule, [my] lord, over us, both thou, and thy son, and thy son's son; for thou hast saved us out of the hand of Madiam.
007	JDG	008	023	And Gedeon said to them, I will not rule, and my son shall not rule among you; the Lord shall rule over you.
007	JDG	008	024	And Gedeon said to them, I will make a request of you, and do ye give me every man an earring out of his spoils: for they had golden earrings, for they were Ismaelites.
007	JDG	008	025	And they said, We will certainly give them: and he opened his garment, and each man cast therein an earring of his spoils.
007	JDG	008	026	And the weight of the golden earrings which he asked, was a thousand and seven hundred pieces of gold, besides the crescents, and the chains, and the garments, and the purple cloths that were on the kings of Madiam, and besides the chains that were on the necks of their camels.
007	JDG	008	027	And Gedeon made an ephod of it, an set it in his city in Ephratha; and all Israel went thither a whoring after it, and it became a stumbling-block to Gedeon and his house.
007	JDG	008	028	And Madiam, was straitened before the children of Israel, and they did not lift up their head any more; and the land had rest forty years in the days of Gedeon.
007	JDG	008	029	And Jerobaal the son of Joas went and sat in his house.
007	JDG	008	030	And Gedeon had seventy sons begotten of his body, for he had many wives.
007	JDG	008	031	And his concubine was in Sychem, and she also bore him a son, and gave him the name Abimelech.
007	JDG	008	032	And Gedeon son of Joas died in his city, and he was buried in the sepulchre of Joas his father in Ephratha of Abi-Esdri.
007	JDG	008	033	And it came to pass when Gedeon was dead, that the children of Israel turned, and went a whoring after Baalim, and made for themselves a covenant with Baal that he should be their god.
007	JDG	008	034	And the children of Israel remembered not the Lord their God who had delivered them out of the hand of all that afflicted them round about.
007	JDG	008	035	And they did not deal mercifully with the house of Jerobaal, (the same is Gedeon) according to all the good which he did to Israel.
007	JDG	009	001	And Abimelech son of Jerobaal went to Sychem to his mother's brethren; and he spoke to them and to all the kindred of the house of his mother's father, saying,
007	JDG	009	002	Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the men of Sychem, saying, Which [is] better for you, that seventy men, even all the sons of Jerobaal, should reign over you, or that one man should reign over you? and remember that I am your bone and your flesh.
007	JDG	009	003	And his mother's brethren spoke concerning him in the ears of all the men of Sychem all these words; and their heart turned after Abimelech, for they said, He is our brother.
007	JDG	009	004	And they gave him seventy [pieces] of silver out of the house of Baalberith; and Abimelech hired for himself vain and cowardly men, and they went after him.
007	JDG	009	005	And he went to the house of his father to Ephratha, and slew his brethren the sons of Jerobaal, seventy men upon one stone; but Joatham the youngest son of Jerobaal was left, for he hid himself.
007	JDG	009	006	And all the men of Sicima, and all the house of Bethmaalo, were gathered together, and they went and made Abimelech king by the oak of Sedition, which was at Sicima.
007	JDG	009	007	And it was reported to Joatham, and he went and stood on the top of mount Garizin, and lifted up his voice, and wept, and said to them, Hear me, ye men of Sicima, and God shall hear you.
007	JDG	009	008	The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them; and they said to the olive, Reign over us.
007	JDG	009	009	But the olives said to them, Shall I leave my fatness, with which men shall glorify God, and go to be promoted over the trees?
007	JDG	009	010	And the trees said to the fig-tree, Come, reign over us.
007	JDG	009	011	But the fig-tree said to them, Shall I leave my sweetness an my good fruits, and go to be promoted over the trees?
007	JDG	009	012	And the trees said to the vine, Come, reign over us.
007	JDG	009	013	And the vine said to them, Shall I leave my wine that cheers God and men, and go to be promoted over the trees?
007	JDG	009	014	Then all the trees said to the bramble, Come thou and [reign] over us.
007	JDG	009	015	And the bramble said to the trees, If ye in truth anoint me to reign over you, come, stand under my shadow; and if not, let fire come out from me and devour the cedars of Libanus.
007	JDG	009	016	And now, if ye have done it in truth and integrity, and have made Abimelech king, and if ye have wrought well with Jerobaal, and with his house, and if ye have done to him according to the reward of his hand,
007	JDG	009	017	as my father fought for you, and put his life in jeopardy, and delivered you out of the hand of Madiam;
007	JDG	009	018	and ye are risen up this day against the house of my father, and have slain his sons, being seventy men, upon one stone, and have made Abimelech the son of his bondwoman king over the men of Sicima, because he is your brother:
007	JDG	009	019	if then ye have done truly and faithfully with Jerobaal, and with his house this day, rejoice ye in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice over you:
007	JDG	009	020	but if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour the men of Sicima, and the house of Bethmaalo; and let fire come out from the men of Sicima and from the house of Bethmaalo, and devour Abimelech.
007	JDG	009	021	And Joatham fled, and ran away, and went as far as Baeer, and dwelt there out of the way of his brother Abimelech.
007	JDG	009	022	And Abimelech reigned over Israel three years.
007	JDG	009	023	And God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Sicima; and the men of Sicima dealt treacherously with the house of Abimelech:
007	JDG	009	024	to bring the injury done to the seventy sons of Jerobaal, and to lay their blood upon their brother Abimelech, who slew them, and upon the men of Sicima, because they strengthened his hands to slay his brethren.
007	JDG	009	025	And the men of Sicima set liers in wait against him on the top of the mountains, and robbed every one who passed by them on the way; and it was reported to the king Abimelech.
007	JDG	009	026	And Gaal son of Jobel came, and his brethren, and passed by Sicima, and the men of Sicima trusted in him.
007	JDG	009	027	And they went out into the field, and gathered their grapes, and trod them, and made merry; and they brought [the grapes] into the house of their god, and ate and drank, and cursed Abimelech.
007	JDG	009	028	And Gaal the son of Jobel said, Who is Abimelech, and who is the son of Sychem, that we should serve him? [Is he] not the son of Jerobaal, and [is] not Zebul his steward, his servant with the son of Emmor the father of Sychem? and why should we serve him?
007	JDG	009	029	And would that this people were under my hand! then would I remove Abimelech, and I would say to him, Multiply thy host, and come out.
007	JDG	009	030	And Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Jobel, and he was very angry.
007	JDG	009	031	And he sent messengers to Abimelech secretly, saying, Behold, Gaal the son of Jobel and his brethren are come to Sychem; and behold, they have besieged the city against thee.
007	JDG	009	032	And now rise up by night, thou and the people with thee, and lay wait in the field.
007	JDG	009	033	And it shall come to pass in the morning at sunrising, thou shalt rise up early and draw toward the city; and behold, he and the people with him will come forth against thee, and thou shalt do to him according to thy power.
007	JDG	009	034	And Abimelech and all the people with him rose up by night, and formed an ambuscade against Sychem in four companies.
007	JDG	009	035	And Gaal the son of Jobel went forth, and stood by the door of the gate of the city: and Abimelech and the people with him rose up from the ambuscade.
007	JDG	009	036	And Gaal the son of Jobel saw the people, and said to Zebul, Behold, a people comes down from the top of the mountains: and Zebul said to him, Thou seest the shadow of the mountains as men.
007	JDG	009	037	And Gaal continued to speak and said, Behold, a people comes down westward from the part bordering on the middle of the land, and another company comes by the way of Helon Maonenim.
007	JDG	009	038	And Zebul said to him, And where is thy mouth as thou spokest, Who is Abimelech that we should serve him? [Is] not this the people whom thou despisedst? go forth now, and set the battle in array against him.
007	JDG	009	039	And Gaal went forth before the men of Sychem, and set the battle in array against Abimelech.
007	JDG	009	040	And Abimelech pursued him, and he fled from before him; and many fell down slain as far as the door of the gate.
007	JDG	009	041	And Abimelech entered into Arema, and Zebul cast out Gaal and his brethren, so that they should not dwell in Sychem.
007	JDG	009	042	And it came to pass on the second day that the people went out into the field, and [one] brought word to Abimelech.
007	JDG	009	043	And he took the people, and divided them into three companies, and formed an ambush in the field; and he looked, and, behold, the people went forth out of the city, and he rose up against them, and smote them.
007	JDG	009	044	And Abimelech and the chiefs of companies that were with him rushed forward, and stood by the door of the gate of the city; and the two [other] companies rushed forward upon all that were in the field, and smote them.
007	JDG	009	045	And Abimelech fought against the city all that day, and took the city, and slew the people that were in it, and destroyed the city, and sowed it with salt.
007	JDG	009	046	And all the men of the tower of Sychem heard, and came to the gathering of Baethel-berith.
007	JDG	009	047	And it was reported to Abimelech, that all the men of the tower of Sychem were gathered together.
007	JDG	009	048	And Abimelech went up to the mount of Selmon, and all the people that were with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his hand, and cut down a branch of a tree, and took it, and laid it on his shoulders; and said to the people that were with him, What ye see me doing, do quickly as I.
007	JDG	009	049	And they cut down likewise even every man a branch, and went after Abimelech, and laid them against the place of gathering, and burnt the place of gathering over them with fire; and they died, even all the men of the tower of Sicima, about a thousand men and women.
007	JDG	009	050	And Abimelech went out of Baethel-berith, and encamped against Thebes, and took it.
007	JDG	009	051	And there was a strong tower in the midst of the city; and thither all the men and the women of the city fled, and shut [the door] without them, and went up on the roof of the tower.
007	JDG	009	052	And Abimelech drew near to the tower, and they besieged it; and Abimelech drew near to the door of the tower to burn it with fire.
007	JDG	009	053	And a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon the head of Abimelech, and broke his skull.
007	JDG	009	054	And he cried out quickly to the young man his armour-bearer, and said to him, Draw thy sword, and slay me, lest at any time they should say, A woman slew him: and his young man thrust him through and he died.
007	JDG	009	055	And the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead; and they went each to his place.
007	JDG	009	056	So God requited the wickedness of Abimelech, which he wrought against his father, in slaying his seventy brethren.
007	JDG	009	057	And all the wickedness of the men of Sychem God requited upon their head; and the curse of Joatham the son of Jerobaal came upon them.
007	JDG	010	001	And after Abimelech Thola the son of Phua rose up to save Israel, [being] the son of his father's brother, a man of Issachar; and he dwelt in Samir in mount Ephraim.
007	JDG	010	002	And he judged Israel twenty-three years, and died, and was buried in Samir.
007	JDG	010	003	And after him arose Jair of Galaad, and he judged Israel twenty-two years.
007	JDG	010	004	And he had thirty-two sons riding on thirty-two colts, and they had thirty-two cities; and they called them Jair's towns until this day in the land of Galaad.
007	JDG	010	005	And Jair died, and was buried in Rhamnon.
007	JDG	010	006	And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the Lord, and served Baalim, and Astaroth, and the gods of Aram, and the gods of Sidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the children of Ammon, and the gods of the Phylistines; and they forsook the Lord, and did not serve him.
007	JDG	010	007	And the Lord was very angry with Israel, and sold them into the hands of the Phylistines, and into the hand of the children of Ammon.
007	JDG	010	008	And they afflicted and bruised the children of Israel at that time eighteen years, all the children of Israel beyond Jordan in the land of the Amorite in Galaad.
007	JDG	010	009	And the children of Ammon went over Jordan to fight with Juda, and Benjamin, and with Ephraim; and the children of Israel were greatly afflicted.
007	JDG	010	010	And the children of Israel cried to the Lord, saying, We have sinned against thee, because we have forsaken God, and served Baalim.
007	JDG	010	011	And the Lord said to the children of Israel, Did I not [save you] from Egypt and from the Amorite, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Phylistines,
007	JDG	010	012	and from the Sidonians, and Amalec, and Madiam, who afflicted you? and ye cried to me, and I saved you out of their hand?
007	JDG	010	013	Yet ye forsook me and served other gods; therefore I will not save you any more.
007	JDG	010	014	Go, and cry to the gods whom ye have chosen to yourselves, and let them save you in the time of your affliction.
007	JDG	010	015	And the children of Israel said to the Lord, We have sinned: do thou to us according to all [that is] good in thine eyes; only deliver us this day.
007	JDG	010	016	And they put away the strange gods from the midst of them, and served the Lord only, and his soul was pained for the trouble of Israel.
007	JDG	010	017	And the children of Ammon went up, and encamped in Galaad; and the children of Israel were gathered together and encamped on the hill.
007	JDG	010	018	And the people the princes of Galaad said every man to his neighbour, Who [is] he that shall begin to fight against the children of Ammon? he shall even be head over all that dwell in Galaad.
007	JDG	011	001	And Jephthae the Galaadite [was] a mighty man; and he [was] the son of a harlot, who bore Jephthae to Galaad.
007	JDG	011	002	And the wife of Galaad bore him sons; and the sons of his wife grew up, and they cast out Jephthae, and said to him, Thou shalt not inherit in the house of our father, for thou art the son of a concubine.
007	JDG	011	003	And Jephthae fled from the face of his brethren, and dwelt in the land of Tob; and vain men gathered to Jephthae, and went out with him.
007	JDG	011	004	And it came to pass when the children of Ammon prepared to fight with Israel,
007	JDG	011	005	that the elders of Galaad went to fetch Jephthae from the land of Tob.
007	JDG	011	006	And they said to Jephthae, Come, and be our head, and we will fight with the sons of Ammon.
007	JDG	011	007	And Jephthae said to the elders of Galaad, Did ye not hate me, and cast me out of my father's house, and banish me from you? and wherefore are ye come to me now when ye want me?
007	JDG	011	008	And the elders of Galaad said to Jephthae, Therefore have we now turned to thee, that thou shouldest go with us, and fight against the sons of Ammon, and be our head over all the inhabitants of Galaad.
007	JDG	011	009	And Jephthae said to the elders of Galaad, If ye turn me back to fight with the children of Ammon, and the Lord should deliver them before me, then will I be your head.
007	JDG	011	010	And the elders of Galaad said to Jephthae, The Lord be witness between us, if we shall not do according to thy word.
007	JDG	011	011	And Jephthae went with the elders of Galaad, and the people made him head and ruler over them: and Jephthae spoke all his words before the Lord in Massepha.
007	JDG	011	012	And Jephthae sent messengers to the king of the children of Ammon, saying, What have I to do with thee, that thou hast come against me to fight in my land?
007	JDG	011	013	And the king of the children of Ammon said to the messengers of Jephthae, Because Israel took my land when he went up out of Egypt, from Arnon to Jaboc, and to Jordan: now then return them peaceably and I will depart.
007	JDG	011	014	And Jephthae again sent messengers to the king of the children of Ammon,
007	JDG	011	015	and said to him, Thus says Jephthae, Israel took not the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon;
007	JDG	011	016	for in their going up out of Egypt Israel went in the wilderness as far as the sea of Siph, and came to Cades.
007	JDG	011	017	And Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, I will pass, if it please thee, by thy land: and the king of Edom complied not: and [Israel] also sent to the king of Moab, and he did not consent; and Israel sojourned in Cades.
007	JDG	011	018	And [they] journeyed in the wilderness, and compassed the land of Edom and the land of Moab: and they came by the east of the land of Moab, an encamped in the country beyond Arnon, and came not within the borders of Moab, for Arnon [is] the border of Moab.
007	JDG	011	019	And Israel sent messengers to Seon king of the Amorite, king of Esbon, and Israel said to him, Let us pass, we pray thee, by thy land to our place.
007	JDG	011	020	And Seon did not trust Israel to pass by his coast; and Seon gathered all his people, and they encamped at Jasa; and he set the battle in array against Israel.
007	JDG	011	021	And the Lord God of Israel delivered Seon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they smote him; and Israel inherited all the land of the Amorite who dwelt in that land,
007	JDG	011	022	from Arnon and to Jaboc, and from the wilderness to Jordan.
007	JDG	011	023	And now the Lord God of Israel has removed the Amorite from before his people Israel, and shalt thou inherit his [land]?
007	JDG	011	024	Wilt thou not inherit those possessions which Chamos thy god shall cause thee to inherit; and shall not we inherit the [land of] all those whom the Lord our God has removed from before you?
007	JDG	011	025	And now art thou any better than Balac son of Sepphor, king of Moab? did he indeed fight with Israel, or indeed make war with him,
007	JDG	011	026	when [Israel] dwelt in Esebon and in its coasts, and in the land of Aroer and in its coasts, and in all the cities by Jordan, three hundred years? and wherefore didst thou not recover them in that time?
007	JDG	011	027	And now I have not sinned against thee, but thou wrongest me in preparing war against me: may the Lord the Judge judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon.
007	JDG	011	028	But the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not to the words of Jephthae, which he sent to him.
007	JDG	011	029	And the spirit of the Lord came upon Jephthae, and he passed over Galaad, and Manasse, and passed by the watch-tower of Galaad to the other side of the children of Ammon.
007	JDG	011	030	And Jephthae vowed a vow to the Lord, and said, If thou wilt indeed deliver the children of Ammon into my hand,
007	JDG	011	031	then it shall come to pass that whosoever shall first come out of the door of my house to meet me when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, he shall be the Lord's: I will offer him up for a whole-burnt-offering.
007	JDG	011	032	And Jephthae advanced to meet the sons of Ammon to fight against them; and the Lord delivered them into his hand.
007	JDG	011	033	And he smote them from Aroer till [one] comes to Arnon, in number twenty cities, and as far as Ebelcharmim, with a very great destruction: and the children of Ammon were straitened before the children of Israel.
007	JDG	011	034	And Jephthae came to Massepha to his house; and behold, his daughter came forth to meet him with timbrels and dances; and she was his only child, he had not another son or daughter.
007	JDG	011	035	And it came to pass when he saw her, that he rent his garments, and said, Ah, ah, my daughter, thou hast indeed troubled me, and thou wast the cause of my trouble; and I have opened my mouth against thee to the Lord, and I shall not be able to return from it.
007	JDG	011	036	And she said to him, Father, hast thou opened thy mouth to the Lord? Do to me accordingly as [the word] went out of thy mouth, in that the Lord has wrought vengeance for thee on thine enemies of the children of Ammon.
007	JDG	011	037	And she said to her father, Let my father now do this thing: let me alone for two months, and I will go up and down on the mountains, and I will bewail my virginity, I and my companions.
007	JDG	011	038	And he said, Go: and he sent her away for two months; and she went, and her companions, and she bewailed her virginity on the mountains.
007	JDG	011	039	And it came to pass at the end of the two months that she returned to her father; and he performed upon her his vow which he vowed; and she knew no man:
007	JDG	011	040	and it was an ordinance in Israel, [That] the daughters of Israel went from year to year to bewail the daughter of Jephthae the Galaadite for four days in a year.
007	JDG	012	001	And the men of Ephraim assembled [themselves], and passed on to the north, and said to Jephthae, Wherefore didst thou go over to fight with the children of Ammon, and didst not call us to go with thee? we will burn thy house over thee with fire.
007	JDG	012	002	And Jephthae said to them, I and my people and the children of Ammon were very much engaged in war; and I called for you, and ye did not save me out of their hand.
007	JDG	012	003	And I saw that thou wert no helper, and I put my life in my hand, and passed on to the sons of Ammon; and the Lord delivered them into my hand: and wherefore are ye come up against me this day to fight with me?
007	JDG	012	004	And Jephthae gathered all the men of Galaad, and fought with Ephraim; and the men of Galaad smote Ephraim, because they that were escaped of Ephraim said, Ye [are] of Galaad in the midst of Ephraim and in the midst of Manasse.
007	JDG	012	005	And Galaad took the fords of Jordan before Ephraim; and they that escaped of Ephraim said to them, Let us go over: and the men of Galaad said, Art thou an Ephrathite? and he said, No.
007	JDG	012	006	Then they said to him, Say now Stachys; and he did not rightly pronounce it so: and they took him, and slew him at the fords of Jordan; and there fell at that time of Ephraim two and forty thousand.
007	JDG	012	007	And Jephthae judged Israel six years; and Jephthae the Galaadite died, and was buried in his city Galaad.
007	JDG	012	008	And after him Abaissan of Bethleem judged Israel.
007	JDG	012	009	And he had thirty sons, and thirty daughters, whom he sent forth; and he brought in thirty daughters for his sons from without; and he judged Israel seven years.
007	JDG	012	010	And Abaissan died, and was buried in Bethleem.
007	JDG	012	011	And after him Aelom of Zabulon judged Israel ten years.
007	JDG	012	012	And Aelom of Zabulon died, and was buried in Aelom in the land of Zabulon.
007	JDG	012	013	And after him Abdon the son of Ellel, the Pharathonite, judged Israel.
007	JDG	012	014	And he had forty sons, and thirty grandsons, that rode upon seventy colts: and he judged Israel eight years.
007	JDG	012	015	And Abdon the son of Ellel, the Pharathonite, died, and was buried in Pharathon in the land of Ephraim in the mount of Amalec.
007	JDG	013	001	And the children of Israel yet again committed iniquity before the Lord; and the Lord delivered them into the hand of the Phylistines forty years.
007	JDG	013	002	And there was a man of Saraa, of the family of the kindred of Dan, and his name was Manoe, and his wife was barren, and bore not.
007	JDG	013	003	And an angel of the Lord appeared to the woman, and said to her, Behold, thou art barren and hast not born; yet thou shalt conceive a son.
007	JDG	013	004	And now be very cautious, and drink no wine nor strong drink, and eat no unclean thing;
007	JDG	013	005	for behold, thou art with child, and shalt bring forth a son; and there shall come no razor upon his head, for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from the womb; and he shall begin to save Israel from the hand of the Phylistines.
007	JDG	013	006	And the woman went in, and spoke to her husband, saying, A man of God came to me, and his appearance [was as] of an angel of God, very dreadful; and I did not ask him whence he was, and he did not tell me his name.
007	JDG	013	007	And he said to me, Behold, thou art with child, and shalt bring forth a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, and eat no unclean thing; for the child shall be holy to God from the womb until the day of his death.
007	JDG	013	008	And Manoe prayed to the Lord and said, I pray thee, O Lord my lord, [concerning] the man of God whom thou sentest; let him now come to us once more, and teach us what we shall do to the child about to be born.
007	JDG	013	009	And the Lord heard the voice of Manoe, and the angel of God came yet again to the woman; and she sat in the field, and Manoe her husband was not with her.
007	JDG	013	010	And the woman hasted, and ran, and brought word to her husband, and said to him, Behold the man who came in [the other] day to me has appeared to me.
007	JDG	013	011	And Manoe arose and followed his wife, and came to the man, and said to him, Art thou the man that spoke to the woman? and the angel said, I [am].
007	JDG	013	012	And Manoe said, Now shall [thy] word come to pass: what shall be the ordering of the child, and our dealings with him?
007	JDG	013	013	And the angel of the Lord said to Manoe, Of all things concerning which I spoke to the woman, she shall beware.
007	JDG	013	014	She shall eat of nothing that comes of the vine yielding wine, and let her not drink wine or strong liquor, and let her not eat anything unclean: all things that I have charged her she shall observe.
007	JDG	013	015	And Manoe said to the angel of the Lord, Let us detain thee here, and prepare before thee a kid of the goats.
007	JDG	013	016	And the angel of the Lord said to Manoe, If thou shouldest detain me, I will not eat of thy bread; and if thou wouldest offer a whole-burnt-offering, to the Lord thou shalt offer it: for Manoe knew not that he [was] an angel of the Lord.
007	JDG	013	017	And Manoe said to the angel of the Lord, What [is] thy name, that [when] thy word shall come to pass, we may glorify thee?
007	JDG	013	018	And the angel of the Lord said to him, Why dost thou thus ask after my name; whereas it is wonderful?
007	JDG	013	019	And Manoe took a kid of the goats and its meat-offering, and offered it on the rock to the Lord; and [the angel] wrought a distinct work, and Manoe and his wife were looking on.
007	JDG	013	020	And it came to pass when the flame went up above the altar toward heaven, that the angel of the Lord went up in the flame; and Manoe and his wife were looking, and they fell upon their face to the earth.
007	JDG	013	021	And the angel appeared no more to Manoe and to his wife: then Manoe knew that this [was] an angel of the Lord.
007	JDG	013	022	And Manoe said to his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God.
007	JDG	013	023	But his wife said to him, If the Lord were pleased to slay us, he would not have received of our hand a whole-burnt-offering and a meat-offering; and he would not have shewn us all these things, neither would he have caused us to hear all these things
007	JDG	013	024	And the woman brought forth a son, and she called his name Sampson; and the child grew, and the Lord blessed him.
007	JDG	013	025	And the Spirit of the Lord began to go out with him in the camp of Dan, and between Saraa and Esthaol.
007	JDG	014	001	And Sampson went down to Thamnatha, and saw a woman in Thamnatha of the daughters of the Philistines.
007	JDG	014	002	And he went up and told his father and his mother, and said, I have seen a woman in Thamnatha of the daughters of the Phylistines; and now take her to me for a wife.
007	JDG	014	003	And his father and his mother said to him, Are there no daughters of thy brethren, and [is there not] a woman of all my people, that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines? And Sampson said to his father, Take her for me, for she [is] right in my eyes.
007	JDG	014	004	And his father and his mother knew not that it was of the Lord, that he sought to be revenged on the Philistines: and at that time the Philistines lorded it over Israel.
007	JDG	014	005	And Sampson and his father and his mother went down to Thamnatha, and he came to the vineyard of Thamnatha; and behold, a young lion roared in meeting him.
007	JDG	014	006	And the spirit of the Lord came powerfully upon him, and he crushed him as he would have crushed a kid of the goats, and there was nothing in his hands: and he told not his father and his mother what he had done.
007	JDG	014	007	And they went down and spoke to the woman, and she was pleasing in the eyes of Sampson.
007	JDG	014	008	And after some time he returned to take her, and he turned aside to see the carcase of the lion; and behold, a swarm of bees, and honey [were] in the mouth of the lion.
007	JDG	014	009	And he took it into his hands, and went on eating, and he went to his father and his mother, and gave to them, and they did eat; but he told them not that he took the honey out of the mouth of the lion.
007	JDG	014	010	And his father went down to the woman, and Sampson made there a banquet for seven days, for so the young men are used to do.
007	JDG	014	011	And it came to pass when they saw him, that they took thirty guests, and they were with him.
007	JDG	014	012	And Sampson said to them, I propound you a riddle: if ye will indeed tell it me, and discover it within the seven days of the feast, I will you give thirty sheets and thirty changes of raiment.
007	JDG	014	013	And if ye cannot tell it me, ye shall give me thirty napkins and thirty changes of apparel: and they said to him, Propound thy riddle, and we will hear it.
007	JDG	014	014	And he said to them, Meat came forth of the eater, and sweetness out of the strong: and they could not tell the riddle for three days.
007	JDG	014	015	And it came to pass on the fourth day, that they said to the wife of Sampson, Deceive now thy husband, and let him tell thee the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy father's house with fire: did ye invite us to do us violence?
007	JDG	014	016	And Sampson's wife wept before him, and said, Thou dost but hate me, and lovest me not; for the riddle which thou hast propounded to the children of my people thou hast not told me: and Sampson said to her, If I have not told it to my father and my mother, shall I tell it to thee?
007	JDG	014	017	And she wept before him the seven days, during which their banquet lasted: and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told her, because she troubled him; and she told it to the children of her people.
007	JDG	014	018	And the men of the city said to him on the seventh day, before sunrise, What [is] sweeter than honey? and what [is] stronger than a lion? and Sampson said to them, If ye had not ploughed with my heifer, ye would not have known my riddle.
007	JDG	014	019	And the Spirit of the Lord came upon him powerfully, and he went down to Ascalon, and destroyed of the inhabitants thirty men, and took their garments, and gave the changes of raiment to them that told the riddle; and Sampson was very angry, and went up to the house of his father.
007	JDG	014	020	And the wife of Sampson was [given] to one of his friends, with whom he was on terms of friendship.
007	JDG	015	001	And it came to pass after a time, in the days of wheat harvest, that Sampson visited his wife with a kid, and said, I will go in to my wife even into the chamber: but her father did not suffer him to go in.
007	JDG	015	002	And her father spoke, saying, I said that thou didst surely hate her, and I gave her to one of thy friends: [is] not her younger sister better than she? let her be to thee instead of her.
007	JDG	015	003	And Sampson said to them, Even for once am I guiltless with regard to the Philistines, in that I do mischief among them.
007	JDG	015	004	And Sampson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took torches, and turned tail to tail, and put a torch between two tails, and fastened it.
007	JDG	015	005	And he set fire to the torches, and sent [the foxes] into the corn of the Philistines; and every thing was burnt from the threshing floor to the standing corn, and even to the vineyard and olives.
007	JDG	015	006	And the Philistines said, Who [has done] these things? and they said, Sampson the son-in-law of the Thamnite, because he has taken his wife, and given her to one of his friends; and the Philistines went up, and burnt her and her father's house with fire.
007	JDG	015	007	And Sampson said to them, Though ye may have dealt thus with her, verily I will be avenged of you, and afterwards I will cease.
007	JDG	015	008	And he smote them leg on thigh [with] a great overthrow; and went down and dwelt in a cave of the rock Etam.
007	JDG	015	009	And the Philistines went up, and encamped in Juda, and spread themselves abroad in Lechi.
007	JDG	015	010	And the men of Juda said, Why are ye come up against us? and the Philistines said, We are come up to bind Sampson, and to do to him as he has done to us.
007	JDG	015	011	And the three thousand men of Juda went down to the hole of the rock Etam, and they said to Sampson, Knowest thou not that the Philistines rule over us? and what [is] this [that] thou hast done to us? and Sampson said to them, As they did to me, so have I done to them.
007	JDG	015	012	And they said to him, We are come down to bind thee to deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines: and Sampson said to them, Swear to me that ye will not fall upon me yourselves.
007	JDG	015	013	And they spoke to him, saying, Nay, but we will only bind thee fast, and deliver thee into their hand, and will by no means slay thee: and they bound him with two new ropes, and brought him from that rock.
007	JDG	015	014	And they came to Lechi: and the Philistines shouted, and ran to meet him: and the Spirit of the Lord came mightily upon him, and the ropes that were upon his arms became as tow which is burnt with fire; and his bonds were consumed from off his hands.
007	JDG	015	015	And he found the jaw-bone of an ass that had been cast away, and he put forth his hand and took it, and smote with it a thousand men.
007	JDG	015	016	And Sampson said, With the jaw-bone of an ass I have utterly destroyed them, for with the jaw-bone of an ass I have smitten a thousand men.
007	JDG	015	017	And it came to pass when he ceased speaking, that he cast the jaw-bone out of his hand; and he called that place the Lifting of the jaw-bone.
007	JDG	015	018	And he was very thirsty, and wept before the Lord, and said, Thou hast been well pleased to grant this great deliverance by the hand of thy servant, and new shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?
007	JDG	015	019	And God broke open a hollow place in the jaw, and there came thence water, and he drank; and his spirit returned and he revived: therefore the name of the fountain was called 'The well of the invoker,' which is in Lechi, until this day.
007	JDG	015	020	And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years.
007	JDG	016	001	And Sampson went to Gaza, and saw there a harlot, and went in to her.
007	JDG	016	002	And it was reported to the Gazites, saying, Sampson is come hither: and they compassed him and laid wait for him all night in the gate of the city, and they were quiet all the night, saying, Let us wait till the dawn appear, and we will slay him.
007	JDG	016	003	And Sampson slept till midnight, and rose up at midnight, and took hold of the doors of the gate of the city with the two posts, and lifted them up with the bar, and laid them on his shoulders, and he went up to the top of the mountain that is before Chebron, and laid them there.
007	JDG	016	004	And it came to pass after this that he loved a woman in Alsorech, and her name [was] Dalida.
007	JDG	016	005	And the princess of the Philistines came up to her, and said to her, Beguile him, and see wherein his great strength [is], and wherewith we shall prevail against him, and bind him to humble him; and we will give thee each eleven hundred [pieces] of silver.
007	JDG	016	006	And Dalida said to Sampson, Tell me, I pray thee, wherein [is] thy great strength, and wherewith thou shalt be bound that thou mayest be humbled.
007	JDG	016	007	And Sampson said to her, If they bind me with seven moist cords that have not been spoiled, then shall I be weak and be as one of ordinary men.
007	JDG	016	008	And the princess of the Philistines brought to her seven moist cords that had not been spoiled, and she bound him with them.
007	JDG	016	009	And the liers in wait remained with her in the chamber; and she said to him, the Philistines [are] upon thee, Sampson: and he broke the cords as if any one should break a thread of tow when it has touched the fire, and his strength was not known.
007	JDG	016	010	And Dalida said to Sampson, Behold, thou hast cheated me, and told me lies; now then tell me wherewith thou shalt be bound.
007	JDG	016	011	And he said to her, If they should bind me fast with new ropes with which work has not been done, then shall I be weak, and shall be as another man.
007	JDG	016	012	And Dalida took new ropes, and bound him with them, and the liers in wait came out of the chamber, and she said, The Philistines [are] upon thee, Sampson: and he broke them off his arms like a thread.
007	JDG	016	013	And Dalida said to Sampson, Behold, thou hast deceived me, and told me lies; tell me, I intreat thee, wherewith thou mayest be bound: and he said to her, If thou shouldest weave the seven locks of my head with the web, and shouldest fasten them with the pin into the wall, then shall I be weak as another man.
007	JDG	016	014	And it came to pass when he was asleep, that Dalida took the seven locks of his head, and wove them with the web, and fastened them with the pin into the wall, and she said, The Philistines [are] upon thee, Sampson: and he awoke out of his sleep, and carried away the pin of the web out of the wall.
007	JDG	016	015	And Dalida said to Sampson, How sayest thou, I love thee, when thy heart is not with me? this third time thou hast deceived me, and hast not told me wherein [is] thy great strength.
007	JDG	016	016	And it came to pass as she pressed him sore with her words continually, and straitened him, that his spirit failed almost to death.
007	JDG	016	017	Then he told her all his heart, and said to her, A razor has not come upon my head, because I have been a holy [one] of God from my mother's womb; if then I should be shaven, my strength will depart from me, and I shall be weak, and I shall be as all [other] men.
007	JDG	016	018	And Dalida saw that he told her all his heart, and she sent and called the princess of the Philistines, saying, Come up yet this once; for he has told me all his heart. And the chiefs of the Philistines went up to her, and brought the money in their hands.
007	JDG	016	019	And Dalida made Sampson sleep upon her knees; and she called a man, and he shaved the seven locks of his head, and she began to humble him, and his strength departed from him.
007	JDG	016	020	And Dalida said, The Philistines [are] upon thee, Sampson: and he awoke out of his sleep and said, I will go out as at former times, and shake myself; and he knew not that the Lord was departed from him.
007	JDG	016	021	And the Philistines took him, and put out his eyes, and brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he ground in the prison-house.
007	JDG	016	022	And the hair of his head began to grow as before it was shaven.
007	JDG	016	023	And the chiefs of the Philistines met to offer a great sacrifice to their god Dagon, and to make merry; and they said, God has given into our hand our enemy Sampson.
007	JDG	016	024	And the people saw him, and sang praises to their god; for our god, [said they], has delivered into our hand our enemy, who wasted our land, and who multiplied our slain.
007	JDG	016	025	And when their heart was merry, then they said, Call Sampson out of the prison-house, and let him play before us: and they called Sampson out of the prison-house, and he played before them; and they smote him with the palms of their hands, and set him between the pillars.
007	JDG	016	026	And Sampson said to the young man that held his hand, Suffer me to feel the pillars on which the house [rests], and I will stay myself upon them.
007	JDG	016	027	And the house [was] full of men and woman, and there were all the chiefs of the Philistines, and on the roof [were] about three thousand men and woman looking at the sports of Sampson.
007	JDG	016	028	And Sampson wept before the Lord, and said, O Lord, my lord, remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, O God, yet this once, and I will requite one recompense to the Philistines for my two eyes.
007	JDG	016	029	And Sampson took hold of the two pillars of the house on which the house stood, and leaned on them, and laid hold of one with his right hand, and the other with his left.
007	JDG	016	030	And Sampson said, Let my wife perish with the Philistines: and he bowed himself mightily; and the house fell upon the princes, and upon all the people that were in it: and the dead whom Sampson slew in his death were more than those whom he slew in his life.
007	JDG	016	031	And his brethren and his father's house went down, and they took him; and they went up and buried him between Saraa and Esthaol in the sepulchre of his father Manoe; and he judged Israel twenty years.
007	JDG	017	001	And there was a man of mount Ephraim, and his name was Michaias.
007	JDG	017	002	And he said to his mother, The eleven hundred pieces of silver which thou tookest of thyself, and [about which] thou cursedst me, and spokest in my ears, behold, the silver [is] with me; I took it: and his mother said, Blessed [be] my son of the Lord.
007	JDG	017	003	And he restored the eleven hundred pieces of silver to his mother; and his mother said, I had wholly consecrated the money to the Lord out of my hand for my son, to make a graven and a molten [image], and now I will restore it to thee.
007	JDG	017	004	But he returned the silver to his mother, and his mother took two hundred pieces of silver, and gave them to a silversmith, and he made it a graven and a molten image; and it was in the house of Michaias.
007	JDG	017	005	And the house of Michaias [was] to him the house of God, and he made an ephod and theraphin, and he consecrated one of his sons, and he became to him a priest.
007	JDG	017	006	And in those days there was no king in Israel; every man did that which was right in his own eyes.
007	JDG	017	007	And there was a young man in Bethleem of the tribe of Juda, and he [was] a Levite, and he was sojourning there.
007	JDG	017	008	And the man departed from Bethleem the city of Juda to sojourn in whatever place he might find; and he came as far as mount Ephraim, and to the house of Michaias to accomplish his journey.
007	JDG	017	009	And Michaias said to him, Whence comest thou? and he said to him, I am a Levite of Bethleem Juda, and I go to sojourn in any place I may find.
007	JDG	017	010	And Michaias said to him, Dwell with me, and be to me a father and a priest; and I will give thee ten pieces of silver by the year, and a change of raiment, and thy living.
007	JDG	017	011	And the Levite went and began to dwell with the man; and the young man was to him as one of his sons.
007	JDG	017	012	And Michaias consecrated the Levite, and he became to him a priest, and he was in the house of Michaias.
007	JDG	017	013	And Michaias said, Now I know that the Lord will do me good, because a Levite has become my priest.
007	JDG	018	001	In those days there was no king in Israel; and in those days the tribe of Dan sought for itself an inheritance to inhabit, because no inheritance had fallen to it until that day in the midst of the tribes of the children of Israel.
007	JDG	018	002	And the sons of Dan sent from their families five men of valour, from Saraa and from Esthaol, to spy out the land and to search it; and they said to them, Go and search out the land. And they came as far as the mount of Ephraim to the house of Michaias and they lodged there,
007	JDG	018	003	in the house of Michaias, and they recognised the voice of the young man the Levite, and turned in thither; and said to him, Who brought thee in hither? and what doest thou in this place? and what hast thou here?
007	JDG	018	004	And he said to them, Thus and thus did Michaias to me, and he hired me, and I became his priest.
007	JDG	018	005	And they said to him, Enquire now of God, and we shall know whether our way will prosper, on which we are going.
007	JDG	018	006	And the priest said to them, Go in peace; your way in which ye go, [is] before the Lord.
007	JDG	018	007	And the five men went on, and came to Laisa; and they saw the people in the midst of it dwelling securely, at ease as [is] the manner of the Sidonians, and there is no one perverting or shaming a matter in the land, no heir extorting treasures; and they are far from the Sidonians, and they have no intercourse with any one.
007	JDG	018	008	And the five men came to their brethren to Saraa and Esthaol, and said to their brethren, Why sit ye here [idle]?
007	JDG	018	009	And they said, Arise, and let us go up against them, for we have seen the land, and, behold, [it is] very good, yet ye are still: delay not to go, an to enter in to possess the land.
007	JDG	018	010	And whensoever ye shall go, ye shall come in upon a people secure, and the land [is] extensive, for God has given it into your hand; a place where there is no want of anything that the earth affords.
007	JDG	018	011	And there departed thence of the families of Dan, from Saraa and from Esthaol, six hundred men, girded with weapons of war.
007	JDG	018	012	And they went up, and encamped in Cariathiarim in Juda; therefore it was called in that place the camp of Dan, until this day: behold, [it is] behind Cariathiarim.
007	JDG	018	013	And they went on thence to the mount of Ephraim, and came to the house of Michaias.
007	JDG	018	014	And the five men who went to spy out the land of Laisa answered, and said to their brethren, Ye know that there is in this place an ephod, and theraphin, and a graven and a molten image; and now consider what ye shall do.
007	JDG	018	015	And they turned aside there, and went into the house of the young man, the Levite, [even] into the house of Michaias, and asked him how he was.
007	JDG	018	016	And the six hundred men of the sons of Dan who were girded with their weapons of war stood by the door of the gate.
007	JDG	018	017	And the five men who went to spy out the land went up, and entered into the house of Michaias, and the priest stood.
007	JDG	018	018	And they took the graven image, and the ephod, and the theraphin, and the molten image; and the priest said to them, What are ye doing?
007	JDG	018	019	And they said to him, Be silent, lay thine hand upon thy mouth, and come with us, and be to us a father and a priest: [is it] better for thee to be the priest of the house of one man, or to be the priest of a tribe and house for a family of Israel?
007	JDG	018	020	And the heart of the priest was glad, and he took the ephod, and the theraphin, and the graven image, and the molten image, and went in the midst of the people.
007	JDG	018	021	So they turned and departed, and put their children and their property and their baggage before them.
007	JDG	018	022	They went some distance from the house of Michaias, and, behold, Michaias and the men in the houses near Michaias' house, cried out, and overtook the children of Dan.
007	JDG	018	023	And the children of Dan turned their face, and said to Michaias, What is the matter with thee that thou hast cried out?
007	JDG	018	024	And Michaias said, Because ye have taken my graven image which I made, and my priest, and are gone; and what have I remaining? and what [is] this [that] ye say to me, Why criest thou?
007	JDG	018	025	And the children of Dan said to him, Let not thy voice be heard with us, lest angry men run upon thee, and take away thy life, and the lives of thy house.
007	JDG	018	026	And the children of Dan went their way; and Michaias saw that they were stronger than himself, and he returned to his house.
007	JDG	018	027	And the children of Dan took what Michaias had made, and the priest that he had, and they came to Laisa, to a people quiet and secure; and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and burnt the city with fire.
007	JDG	018	028	And there was no deliverer, because [the city] is far from the Sidonians, and they have no intercourse with men, and it [is] in the valley of the house of Raab; and they built the city, and dwelt in it.
007	JDG	018	029	And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born to Israel; and the name of the city was Ulamais before.
007	JDG	018	030	And the children of Dan set up the graven image for themselves; and Jonathan son of Gerson son of Manasse, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan till the time of the carrying away of the nation.
007	JDG	018	031	And they set up for themselves the graven image which Michaias made, all the days that the house of God was in Selom; and it was so in those days [that] there was no king in Israel.
007	JDG	019	001	And there was a Levite sojourning in the sides of mount Ephraim, and he took to himself a concubine from Bethleem Juda.
007	JDG	019	002	And his concubine departed from him, and went away from him to the house of her father to Bethleem Juda, and she was there four months.
007	JDG	019	003	And her husband rose up, and went after her to speak kindly to her, to recover her to himself; and he had his young man with him, and a pair of asses; and she brought him into the house of her father; and the father of the damsel saw him, and was well pleased to meet him.
007	JDG	019	004	And his father-in-law, the father of the damsel, constrained him, and he stayed with him for three days; and they ate and drank, and lodged there.
007	JDG	019	005	And it came to pass on the fourth day that they rose early, and he stood up to depart; and the father of the damsel said to his son-in-law, Strengthen thy heart with a morsel of bread, and afterwards ye shall go.
007	JDG	019	006	So they two sat down together and ate and drank: and the father of the damsel said to her husband, Tarry now the night, and let thy heart be merry.
007	JDG	019	007	And the man rose up to depart; but his father-in-law constrained him, and he stayed and lodged there.
007	JDG	019	008	And he rose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart; and the father of the damsel said, Strengthen now thine heart, and quit thyself as a soldier till the day decline; and the two ate.
007	JDG	019	009	And the man rose up to depart, he and his concubine, and his young man; but his father-in-law the father of the damsel said to him, Behold now, the day has declined toward evening; lodge here, an let thy heart rejoice; and ye shall rise early to-morrow for your journey, and thou shalt go to thy habitation.
007	JDG	019	010	But the man would not lodge there, but he arose and departed, and came to the part opposite Jebus, (this is Jerusalem,) and [there was] with him a pair of asses saddled, and his concubine [was] with him.
007	JDG	019	011	And they came as far as Jebus: and the day had far advanced, and the young man said to his master, Come, I pray thee, and let us turn aside to this city of the Jebusites, and let us lodge in it.
007	JDG	019	012	And his master said to him, We will not turn aside to a strange city, where there is not one of the children of Israel, but we will pass on as far as Gabaa.
007	JDG	019	013	And he said to his young man, Come, and let us draw nigh to one of the places, and we will lodge in Gabaa or in Rama.
007	JDG	019	014	And they passed by and went on, and the sun went down upon them near to Gabaa, which is in Benjamin.
007	JDG	019	015	And they turned aside thence to go in to lodge in Gabaa; and they went in, and sat down in the street of the city, and there was no one who conducted them into a house to lodge.
007	JDG	019	016	And behold, an old man came out of the field from his work in the evening; and the man was of mount Ephraim, and he sojourned in Gabaa, and the men of the place [were] sons of Benjamin.
007	JDG	019	017	And he lifted up his eyes, and saw a traveller in the street of the city; and the old man said to him, Whither goest thou, and whence comest thou?
007	JDG	019	018	And he said to him, We are passing by from Bethleem Juda to the sides of mount Ephraim: I am from thence, and I went as far as Bethleem Juda, and I am going home, and there is no man to take me into his house.
007	JDG	019	019	Yet is there straw and food for our asses, and bread and wine for me and my handmaid and the young man with thy servants; there is no want of anything.
007	JDG	019	020	And the old man said, Peace [be] to thee; only be every want of thine upon me, only do thou by no means lodge in the street.
007	JDG	019	021	And he brought him into his house, and made room for his asses; and they washed their feet, and ate and drank.
007	JDG	019	022	And they [were] comforting their heart, when, behold, the men of the city, sons of transgressors, compassed the house, knocking at the door: and they spoke to the old man the owner of the house, saying, Bring out the man who came into thy house, that we may know him.
007	JDG	019	023	And the master of the house came out to them, and said, Nay, brethren, do not ye wrong, I pray you, after this man has come into my house; do not ye this folly.
007	JDG	019	024	Behold my daughter a virgin, and the man's concubine: I will bring them out, and humble ye them, and do to them that which is good in your eyes; but to this man do not this folly.
007	JDG	019	025	But the men would not consent to hearken to him; so the man laid hold of his concubine, and brought her out to them; and they knew her, and abused her all night till the morning, and let her go when the morning dawned.
007	JDG	019	026	And the woman came toward morning, and fell down at the door of the house where her husband was, until it was light.
007	JDG	019	027	And her husband rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went forth to go on his journey; and, behold, the woman his concubine had fallen down by the doors of the house, and her hands were on the threshold.
007	JDG	019	028	And he said to her, Rise, and let us go; and she answered not, for she was dead: and he took her upon his ass, and went to his place.
007	JDG	019	029	And he took his sword, and laid hold of his concubine, and divided her into twelve parts, and sent them to every coast of Israel.
007	JDG	019	030	And it was so, that every one who saw it said, [Such a day] as this has not happened nor has been seen from the day of the going up of the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt until this day: take ye counsel concerning it, and speak.
007	JDG	020	001	And all the children of Israel went out, and all the congregation was gathered as one man, from Dan even to Bersabee, and in the land of Galaad, to the Lord at Massepha.
007	JDG	020	002	And all the tribes of Israel stood before the Lord in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword.
007	JDG	020	003	And the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel were gone up to Massepha: and the children of Israel came and said, Tell us, where did this wickedness take place?
007	JDG	020	004	And the Levite, the husband of the woman that was slain, answered and said, I and my concubine went to Gabaa of Benjamin to lodge.
007	JDG	020	005	And the men of Gabaa rose up against me, and compassed the house by night against me; they wished to slay me, and they have humbled my concubine, and she is dead.
007	JDG	020	006	And I laid hold of my concubine, and divided her in pieces, and sent [the parts] into every coast of the inheritance of the children of Israel; for they have wrought lewdness and abomination in Israel.
007	JDG	020	007	Behold, all ye [are] children of Israel; and consider and take counsel here among yourselves.
007	JDG	020	008	And all the people rose up as one man, saying, No one of us shall return to his tent, and no one of us shall return to his house.
007	JDG	020	009	And now this [is] the thing which shall be done in Gabaa; we will go up against it by lot.
007	JDG	020	010	Moreover we will take ten men for a hundred for all the tribes of Israel, and a hundred for a thousand, and a thousand for ten thousand, to take provision, to cause them to come to Gabaa of Benjamin, to do to it according to all the abomination, which they wrought in Israel.
007	JDG	020	011	And all the men of Israel were gathered to the city as one man.
007	JDG	020	012	And the tribes of Israel sent men through the whole tribe of Benjamin, saying, What [is] this wickedness that has been wrought among you?
007	JDG	020	013	Now then give up the men the sons of transgressors that are in Gabaa, and we will put them to death, and purge out wickedness from Israel: but the children of Benjamin consented not to hearken to the voice of their brethren the children of Israel.
007	JDG	020	014	And the children of Benjamin were gathered from their cities to Gabaa, to go forth to fight with the children of Israel.
007	JDG	020	015	And the children of Benjamin from their cities were numbered in that day, twenty-three thousand, [every] man drawing a sword, besides the inhabitants of Gabaa, who were numbered seven hundred chosen men of all the people, able to use both hands alike;
007	JDG	020	016	All these could sling with stones at a hair, and not miss.
007	JDG	020	017	And the men of Israel, exclusive of Benjamin, were numbered four hundred thousand men that drew sword; all these [were] men of war.
007	JDG	020	018	And they arose and went up to Baethel, and enquired of God: and the children of Israel said, Who shall go up for us first to fight with the children of Benjamin? And the Lord said, Juda shall go up first as leader.
007	JDG	020	019	And the children of Israel rose up in the morning, and encamped against Gabaa.
007	JDG	020	020	And they went out, all the men of Israel, to fight with Benjamin, and engaged with them at Gabaa.
007	JDG	020	021	And the sons of Benjamin went forth from Gabaa, and they destroyed in Israel on that day two and twenty thousand men down to the ground.
007	JDG	020	022	And the men of Israel strengthened themselves, and again engaged in battle in the place where they had engaged on the first day.
007	JDG	020	023	And the children of Israel went up, and wept before the Lord till evening, and enquired of the Lord, saying, Shall we again draw nigh to battle with our brethren the children of Benjamin? and the Lord said, Go up against them.
007	JDG	020	024	And the children of Israel advanced against the children of Benjamin on the second day.
007	JDG	020	025	And the children of Benjamin went forth to meet them from Gabaa on the second day, and destroyed of the children of Israel yet further eighteen thousand men down to the ground: all these drew sword.
007	JDG	020	026	And the children of Israel and all the people went up, and came to Baethel; and they wept, and sat there before the Lord; and they fasted on that day until evening, and offered whole-burnt-offerings and perfect sacrifices, before the Lord,
007	JDG	020	027	for the ark of the Lord God [was] there in those days,
007	JDG	020	028	and Phinees the son of Eleazar the son of Aaron stood before it in those days; and the children of Israel enquired of the Lord, saying, Shall we yet again go forth to fight with our brethren the sons of Benjamin? and the Lord said, Go up, to-morrow I will give them into your hands.
007	JDG	020	029	And the children of Israel set an ambush against Gabaa round about [it].
007	JDG	020	030	And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and arrayed themselves against Gabaa as before.
007	JDG	020	031	And the children of Benjamin went out to meet the people, and were all drawn out of the city, and began to smite and slay the people as before in the roads, whereof one goes up to Baethel, and one to Gabaa in the field, about thirty men of Israel.
007	JDG	020	032	And the children of Benjamin said, They fall before us as at the first: but the children of Israel said, Let us flee, and draw them out from the city into the roads; and they did so.
007	JDG	020	033	And all the men rose up out of their places, and engaged in Baal Thamar; and the liers in wait of Israel advanced from their place from Maraagabe.
007	JDG	020	034	And there came over against Gabaa ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel; and the fight [was] severe; and they knew not that evil was coming upon them.
007	JDG	020	035	And the Lord smote Benjamin before the children of Israel; and the children of Israel destroyed of Benjamin in that day a hundred and twenty-five thousand men: all these drew sword.
007	JDG	020	036	And the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten; and the men of Israel gave place to Benjamin, because they trusted in the ambuscade which they had prepared against Gabaa.
007	JDG	020	037	And when they retreated, then the liers in wait rose up, and they moved toward Gabaa, and the whole ambush came forth, and they smote the city with the edge of the sword.
007	JDG	020	038	And the children of Israel had a signal of battle with the liers in wait, that they should send up a signal of smoke from the city.
007	JDG	020	039	And the children of Israel saw that the liers in wait had seized Gabaa, and they stood in line of battle; and Benjamin began to smite down wounded ones among the men of Israel about thirty men; for they said, Surely they fall again before us, as in the first battle.
007	JDG	020	040	And the signal went up increasingly over the city as a pillar of smoke; and Benjamin looked behind him, and behold the destruction of the city went up to heaven.
007	JDG	020	041	And the men of Israel turned back, and the men of Benjamin hasted, because they saw that evil had come upon them.
007	JDG	020	042	And they turned to the way of the wilderness from before the children of Israel, and fled: but the battle overtook them, and they from the cities destroyed them in the midst of them.
007	JDG	020	043	And they cut down Benjamin, and pursued him from Nua closely till they came opposite Gabaa on the east.
007	JDG	020	044	And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men: all these [were] men of might.
007	JDG	020	045	And the rest turned, and fled to the wilderness to the rock of Remmon; and the children of Israel picked off of them five thousand men; and the children of Israel went down after them as far as Gedan, and they smote of them two thousand men.
007	JDG	020	046	And all that fell of Benjamin were twenty-five thousand men that drew sword in that day: all these were men of might.
007	JDG	020	047	And the rest turned, and fled to the wilderness to the rock of Remmon, even [six] hundred men; and they sojourned four months in the rock of Remmon.
007	JDG	020	048	And the children of Israel returned to the children of Benjamin, and smote them with the edge of the sword from the city of Methla, even to the cattle, and every thing that was found in all the cities: and they burnt with fire the cities they found.
007	JDG	021	001	Now the children of Israel swore in Massephath, saying, No man of us shall give his daughter to Benjamin for a wife.
007	JDG	021	002	And the people came to Baethel, and sat there until evening before God: and they lifted up their voice and wept with a great weeping;
007	JDG	021	003	and said, Wherefore, O Lord God of Israel, has this come to pass, that to-day one tribe should be counted [as missing] from Israel?
007	JDG	021	004	And it came to pass on the morrow that the people rose up early, and built there an altar, and offered up whole-burnt-offerings and peace offerings.
007	JDG	021	005	And the children of Israel said, Who of all the tribes of Israel, went not up in the congregation to the Lord? for there was a great oath concerning those who went not up to the Lord to Massephath, saying, He shall surely be put to death.
007	JDG	021	006	And the children of Israel relented toward Benjamin their brother, and said, To-day one tribe is cut off from Israel.
007	JDG	021	007	What shall we do for wives for the rest that remain? whereas we have sworn by the Lord, not to give them of our daughters for wives.
007	JDG	021	008	And they said, What one [man is there] of the tribes of Israel, who went not up to the Lord to Massephath? and, behold, no man came to the camp from Jabis Galaad to the assembly.
007	JDG	021	009	And the people were numbered, and there was not there a man from the inhabitants of Jabis Galaad.
007	JDG	021	010	And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the strongest, and they charged them, saying, Go ye and smite the inhabitants of Jabis Galaad with the edge of the sword.
007	JDG	021	011	And this shall ye do: every male and every woman that has known the lying with man ye shall devote [to destruction], but the virgins ye shall save alive: and they did so.
007	JDG	021	012	And they found among the inhabitants of Jabis Galaad four hundred young virgins, who had not known man by lying with him; and they brought them to Selom in the land of Chanaan.
007	JDG	021	013	And all the congregation sent and spoke to the children of Benjamin in the rock Remmon, and invited them to [make] peace.
007	JDG	021	014	And Benjamin returned to the children of Israel at that time, and the children of Israel gave them the women whom they [had] save alive of the daughters of Jabis Galaad; and they were content.
007	JDG	021	015	And the people relented for Benjamin, because the Lord had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.
007	JDG	021	016	And the elders of the congregation said, What shall we do for wives for them that remain? for the women have been destroyed out of Benjamin.
007	JDG	021	017	And they said, [There must be] an inheritance of them that are escaped of Benjamin; and [so] a tribe shall not be destroyed out of Israel.
007	JDG	021	018	For we shall not be able to give them wives of our daughters, because we swore among the children of Israel, saying, Cursed [is] he that gives a wife to Benjamin.
007	JDG	021	019	And they said, Lo! now [there is] a feast of the Lord from year to year in Selom, which is on the north of Baethel, eastward on the way that goes up from Baethel to Sychem, and from the south of Lebona.
007	JDG	021	020	And they charged the children of Benjamin, saying, Go and lie in wait in the vineyards;
007	JDG	021	021	and ye shall see; and lo! if there come out the daughters of the inhabitants of Selom to dance in dances, then shall ye go out of the vineyards and seize for yourselves every man a wife of the daughters of Selom, and go ye into the land of Benjamin.
007	JDG	021	022	And it shall come to pass, when their fathers or their brethren come to dispute with us, that we will say to them, Grant them freely to us, for we have not taken every man his wife in the battle: because ye did not give to them according to the occasion, ye transgressed.
007	JDG	021	023	And the children of Benjamin did so; and they took wives according to their number from the dancers whom they seized: and they went and returned to their inheritance, and built the cities, and dwelt in them.
007	JDG	021	024	And the children of Israel went thence at that time every man to his tribe and his kindred; and they went thence every man to his inheritance.
007	JDG	021	025	And in those days there was no king in Israel; every man did that which was right in his own sight.

# BOOK	008	RUT	Ruth	Ruth
008	RUT	001	001	And it came to pass when the judges ruled, that there was a famine in the land: and a man went from Bethleem Juda to sojourn in the land of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.
008	RUT	001	002	And the man's name [was] Elimelech, and his wife's name Noemin, and the names of his two sons Maalon and Chelaion, Ephrathites of Bethleem of Juda: and they came to the land of Moab, and remained there.
008	RUT	001	003	And Elimelech the husband of Noemin died; and she was left, and her two sons.
008	RUT	001	004	And they took to themselves wives, women of Moab; the name of the one [was] Orpha, and the name of the second Ruth; and they dwelt there about ten years.
008	RUT	001	005	And both Maalon and Chelaion died also; and the woman was left of her husband and her two sons.
008	RUT	001	006	And she rose up and her two daughters-in-law, and they returned out of the country of Moab, for she heard in the country of Moab that the Lord [had] visited his people to give them bread.
008	RUT	001	007	And she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters-in-law with her: and they went by the way to return to the land of Juda.
008	RUT	001	008	And Noemin said to her daughter-in-law, Go now, return each to the house of her mother: the Lord deal mercifully with you, as ye have dealt with the dead, and with me.
008	RUT	001	009	The Lord grant you that ye may find rest each of you in the house of her husband: and she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice, and wept.
008	RUT	001	010	And they said to her, We will return with thee to thy people.
008	RUT	001	011	And Noemin said, Return now, my daughters; and why do ye go with me? have I yet sons in my womb to be your husbands?
008	RUT	001	012	Turn now, my daughters, for I am too old to be married: for I said, Suppose I were married, and should bear sons;
008	RUT	001	013	would ye wait for them till they should be grown? or would ye refrain from being married for their sakes? Not so, my daughters; for I am grieved for you, that the hand of the Lord has gone forth against me.
008	RUT	001	014	And they lifted up their voice, and wept again; and Orpha kissed her mother-in-law and returned to her people; but Ruth followed her.
008	RUT	001	015	And Noemin said to Ruth, Behold, thy sister-in-law has returned to her people and to her gods; turn now thou also after thy sister-in-law.
008	RUT	001	016	And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following thee; for whithersoever thou goest, I will go, and wheresoever thou lodgest, I will lodge; thy people [shall be] my people, and thy God my God.
008	RUT	001	017	And wherever thou diest, I will die, and there will I be buried: the Lord do so to me, and more also, [if I leave thee], for death [only] shall divide between me and thee.
008	RUT	001	018	And Noemin seeing that she was determined to go with her, ceased to speak to her any more.
008	RUT	001	019	And they went both of them until they came to Bethleem: and it came to pass, when they arrived at Bethleem, that all the city rang with them, and they said, Is this Noemin?
008	RUT	001	020	And she said to them, Nay, do not call me Noemin; call me 'Bitter,' for the Mighty One has dealt very bitterly with me.
008	RUT	001	021	I went out full, and the Lord has brought me back empty: and why call ye me Noemin, whereas the Lord has humbled me and the Mighty One has afflicted me?
008	RUT	001	022	So Noemin and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, returned from the country of Moab; and they came to Bethleem in the beginning of barley harvest.
008	RUT	002	001	And Noemin had [a friend] an acquaintance of her husband, and the man [was] a mighty man of the kindred of Elimelech, and his name [was] Booz.
008	RUT	002	002	And Ruth the Moabitess said to Noemin, Let me go now to the field, and I will glean among the ears behind the man with whomsoever I shall find favour: and she said to her, Go, daughter.
008	RUT	002	003	And she went; and came and gleaned in the field behind the reapers; and she happened by chance to come on a portion of the land of Booz, of the kindred of Elimelech.
008	RUT	002	004	And, behold, Booz came from Bethleem, and said to the reapers, The Lord [be] with you: and they said to him, The Lord bless thee.
008	RUT	002	005	And Booz said to his servant who was set over the reapers, Whose [is] this damsel?
008	RUT	002	006	And his servant who was set over the reapers answered and said, It is the Moabitish damsel who returned with Noemin out of the land of Moab.
008	RUT	002	007	And she said, I pray you, let me glean and gather among the sheaves after the reapers: and she came and stood from morning till evening, and rested not [even] a little in the field.
008	RUT	002	008	And Booz said to Ruth, Hast thou not heard, [my] daughter? go not to glean in another field; and depart not thou hence, join thyself here with my damsels.
008	RUT	002	009	[Let] thine eyes [be] on the field where [my men] shall reap, and thou shalt go after them: behold, I have charged the young men not to touch thee: and when you shalt thirst, then thou shalt go to the vessels, and drink of that which the young men shall have drawn.
008	RUT	002	010	And she fell upon her face, and did reverence to the ground, and said to him, How is it that I have found grace in thine eyes, that thou shouldest take notice of me, whereas I am a stranger?
008	RUT	002	011	And Booz answered and said to her, It has fully been told me how thou hast dealt with thy mother-in-law after the death of thy husband; and how thou didst leave thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy birth, and camest to a people whom thou knewest not before.
008	RUT	002	012	The Lord recompense thy work; may a full reward be given thee of the Lord God of Israel, to whom thou hast come to trust under his wings.
008	RUT	002	013	And she said, Let me find grace in thy sight, my lord, because thou hast comforted me, and because thou hast spoken kindly to thy handmaid, and behold, I shall be as one of thy servants.
008	RUT	002	014	And Booz said to her, Now [it is] time to eat; come hither, and thou shalt eat of the bread, and thou shalt dip thy morsel in the vinegar: and Ruth sat by the side of the reapers: and Booz handed her meal, and she ate, and was satisfied, and left.
008	RUT	002	015	And she rose up to glean; and Booz charged his young men, saying, Let her even glean among the sheaves, and reproach her not.
008	RUT	002	016	And do ye by all means carry it for her, and ye shall surely let fall for her some of that which is heaped up; and let her eat, and glean, and rebuke her not.
008	RUT	002	017	So she gleaned in the field till evening, and beat out that she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barely.
008	RUT	002	018	And she took [it] up, and went into the city: and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned, and Ruth brought forth and gave to her the food which she had left from what she had been satisfied with.
008	RUT	002	019	And her mother-in-law said to her, Where hast thou gleaned to-day, and where hast thou wrought? blessed be he that took notice of thee. And Ruth told her mother-in-law where she [had] wrought, and said, The name of the man with whom I wrought to-day [is] Booz.
008	RUT	002	020	And Noemin said to her daughter-in-law, Blessed is he of the Lord, because he has not failed in his mercy with the living and with the dead: and Noemin said to her, The man is near akin to us, he is one of our relations.
008	RUT	002	021	And Ruth said to her mother-in-law, Yea, he said also to me, Keep close to my damsels, until the men shall have finished all my reaping.
008	RUT	002	022	And Noemin said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, [It is] well, daughter, that thou wentest out with his damsels; thus they shall not meet thee in another field.
008	RUT	002	023	And Ruth joined herself to the damsels of Booz to glean until they had finished the barley-harvest and the wheat-harvest.
008	RUT	003	001	And she lodged with her mother-in-law: and Noemin her mother-in-law said to her, My daughter, shall I not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee?
008	RUT	003	002	And now [is] not Booz our kinsman, with whose damsels thou wast? behold, he winnows barley this night in the floor.
008	RUT	003	003	But do thou wash, and anoint thyself, and put thy raiment upon thee, and go up to the threshing-floor: do not discover thyself to the man until he has done eating and drinking.
008	RUT	003	004	And it shall come to pass when he lies down, that thou shalt mark the place where he lies down, and shalt come and lift up the covering of his feet, and shalt lie down; and he shall tell thee what thou shalt do.
008	RUT	003	005	And Ruth said to her, All that thou shalt say, I will do.
008	RUT	003	006	And she went down to the threshing-floor, and did according to all that her mother-in-law enjoined her.
008	RUT	003	007	And Booz ate and drank, and his heart was glad, and he came to lie down by the side of the heap of corn; and she came secretly, and lifted up the covering of his feet.
008	RUT	003	008	And it came to pass at midnight that the man was amazed, and troubled, and behold, a woman lay at his feet.
008	RUT	003	009	And he said, Who art thou? and she said, I am thine handmaid Ruth; spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid, for thou art a near relation.
008	RUT	003	010	And Booz said, Blessed [be] thou of the Lord God, [my] daughter, for thou hast made thy latter kindness greater than the former, in that thou followest not after young men, whether [any be] poor or rich.
008	RUT	003	011	And now fear not, my daughter, whatever thou shalt say I will do to thee; for all the tribe of my people knows that thou art a virtuous woman.
008	RUT	003	012	And now I am truly akin to thee; nevertheless there is a kinsman nearer than I.
008	RUT	003	013	Lodge [here] for the night, and it shall be in the morning, if he will do the part of a kinsman to thee, well—let him do it: but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to thee, I will do the kinsman's part to thee, [as] the Lord lives; lie down till the morning.
008	RUT	003	014	And she lay at his feet until the morning; and she rose up before a man could know his neighbour; and Booz said, Let it not be known that a woman came into the floor.
008	RUT	003	015	And he said to her, Bring the apron that is upon thee: and she held it, and he measured six measures of barley, and put them upon her, and she went into the city.
008	RUT	003	016	And Ruth went in to her mother-in-law, and she said to her, [My] daughter! and [Ruth] told her all that the man had done to her.
008	RUT	003	017	And she said to her, He gave me these six measures of barley, for he said to me, Go not empty to thy mother-in-law.
008	RUT	003	018	And she said, Sit still, [my] daughter, until thou shalt know how the matter will fall out; for the man will not rest until the matter be accomplished this day.
008	RUT	004	001	And Booz went up to the gate, and sat there; and behold, the relative passed by, of whom Booz spoke: and Booz said to him, Turn aside, sit down here, such a one: and he turned aside and sat down.
008	RUT	004	002	And Booz took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit ye here; and they sat down.
008	RUT	004	003	And Booz said to the relative, [The matter regards] the portion of the field which was our brother Elimelech's which was given to Noemin, now returning out of the land of Moab;
008	RUT	004	004	and I said, I will inform thee, saying, Buy it before those that sit, and before the elders of my people: if thou wilt redeem it, redeem it, but if thou wilt not redeem it, tell me, and I shall know; for there is no one beside thee to do the office of a kinsman, and I am after thee: and he said, I am [here], I will redeem it.
008	RUT	004	005	And Booz said, In the day of thy buying the field of the hand of Noemin and of Ruth the Moabitess the wife of the deceased, thou must also buy her, so as to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance.
008	RUT	004	006	And the kinsman said, I shall not be able to redeem it for myself, lest I mar my own inheritance; do thou redeem my right for thyself, for I shall not be able to redeem [it].
008	RUT	004	007	And this [was] in former time the ordinance in Israel for redemption, and for a bargain, to confirm every word: A man loosed his shoe, and gave it to his neighbour that redeemed his right; and this was a testimony in Israel.
008	RUT	004	008	And the kinsman said to Booz, Buy my right for thyself: and he took off his shoe and gave it to him.
008	RUT	004	009	And Booz said to the elders and to all the people, Ye [are] this day witnesses, that I have bought all that was Elimelech's, and all that belonged to Chelaion and Maalon, of the hand of Noemin.
008	RUT	004	010	Moreover I have bought for myself for a wife Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Maalon, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance; so the name of the dead shall not be destroyed from among his brethren, and from the tribe of his people: ye [are] this day witnesses.
008	RUT	004	011	And all the people who were in the gate said, [We are] witnesses: and the elders said, The Lord make thy wife who goes into thy house, as Rachel and as Lia, who both [together] built the house of Israel, and wrought mightily in Ephratha, and there shall be a name [to thee] in Bethleem.
008	RUT	004	012	And let thy house be as the house of Phares, whom Thamar bore to Juda, of the seed which the Lord shall give thee of this handmaid.
008	RUT	004	013	And Booz took Ruth, and she became his wife, and he went in to her; and the Lord gave her conception, and she bore a son.
008	RUT	004	014	And the woman said to Noemin, Blessed [is] the Lord, who has not suffered a redeemer to fail thee this day, even to make thy name famous in Israel.
008	RUT	004	015	And he shall be to thee a restorer of thy soul, and one to cherish thy old age; for thy daughter-in-law which has loved thee, who is better to thee than seven sons, has born him.
008	RUT	004	016	And Noemin took the child and laid it in her bosom, and became a nurse to it.
008	RUT	004	017	And the neighbours gave it a name, saying, A son has been born to Noemin; and they called his name Obed; this [is] the father of Jessae the father of David.
008	RUT	004	018	And these [are] the generations of Phares: Phares begot Esrom:
008	RUT	004	019	Esrom begot Aram; and Aram begot Aminadab.
008	RUT	004	020	And Aminadab begot Naasson; and Naasson begot Salmon.
008	RUT	004	021	And Salmon begot Booz; and Booz begot Obed.
008	RUT	004	022	And Obed begot Jessae; and Jessae begot David.

# BOOK	009	1SA	1 Samuel	Kings I
009	1SA	001	001	There was a man of Armathaim Sipha, of mount Ephraim, and his name [was] Helkana, a son of Jeremeel the son of Elias the son of Thoke, in Nasib Ephraim.
009	1SA	001	002	And he [had] two wives; the name of the one [was] Anna, and the name of the second Phennana. And Phennana had children, but Anna had no child.
009	1SA	001	003	And the man went up from year to year from his city, from Armathaim, to worship and sacrifice to the Lord God of Sabaoth at Selom: and [there were] Heli and his two sons Ophni and Phinees, the priests of the Lord.
009	1SA	001	004	And the day came, and Helkana sacrificed, and gave portions to his wife Phennana and her children.
009	1SA	001	005	And to Anna he gave a prime portion, because she had no child, only Helkana loved Anna more than the other; but the Lord [had] closed her womb.
009	1SA	001	006	For the Lord gave her no child in her affliction, and according to the despondency of her affliction; and she was dispirited on this account, that the Lord shut up her womb so as not to give her a child.
009	1SA	001	007	So she did year by year, in going up to the house of the Lord; and she was dispirited, and wept, and did not eat.
009	1SA	001	008	And Helkana her husband said to her, Anna: and she said to him, Here [am] I, my lord: and he said to her, What ails thee that thou weepest? and why dost thou not eat? and why does thy heart smite thee? [am] I not better to thee than ten children?
009	1SA	001	009	And Anna rose up after they had eaten in Selom, and stood before the Lord: and Heli the priest [was] on a seat by the threshold of the temple of the Lord.
009	1SA	001	010	And she [was] very much grieved in spirit, and prayed to the Lord, and wept abundantly.
009	1SA	001	011	And she vowed a vow to the Lord, saying, O Lord God of Sabaoth, if thou welt indeed look upon the humiliation of thine handmaid, and remember me, and give to thine handmaid a man-child, then will I indeed dedicate him to thee till the day of his death; and he shall drink no wine nor strong drink, and no razor shall come upon his head.
009	1SA	001	012	And it came to pass, while she was long praying before the Lord, that Heli the priest marked her mouth.
009	1SA	001	013	And she was speaking in her heart, and her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: and Heli accounted her a drunken woman.
009	1SA	001	014	And the servant of Heli said to her, How long wilt thou be drunken? take away thy wine from thee, and go out from the presence of the Lord.
009	1SA	001	015	And Anna answered and said, Nay, my lord, [I live] in a hard day, and I have not drunk wine or strong drink, and I pour out my soul before the Lord.
009	1SA	001	016	Count not thy handmaid for a pestilent woman, for by reason of the abundance of my importunity I have continued [my prayer] until now.
009	1SA	001	017	And Heli answered and said to her, Go in peace: the God of Israel give thee all thy petition, which thou hast asked of him.
009	1SA	001	018	And she said, Thine handmaid has found favour in thine eyes: and the woman went her way, and entered into her lodging, and ate and drank with her husband, and her countenance was no more sad.
009	1SA	001	019	And they rise early in the morning, and worship the Lord, and they go their way: and Helkana went into his house at Armathaim, and knew his wife Anna; and the Lord remembered her, and she conceived.
009	1SA	001	020	And it came to pass when the time was come, that she brought forth a son, and called his name Samuel, and said, Because I asked him of the Lord God of Sabaoth.
009	1SA	001	021	And the man Helkana and all his house went up to offer in Selom the yearly sacrifice, and his vows, and all the tithes of his land.
009	1SA	001	022	But Anna did not go up with him, for she said to her husband, [I will not go up] until the child goes up, when I have weaned him, and he shall be presented before the Lord, and he shall abide there continually.
009	1SA	001	023	And Helkana her husband said to her, Do that which is good in thine eyes, abide still until thou shalt have weaned him; but may the Lord establish that which comes out of thy mouth: and the woman tarried, and suckled her son until she had weaned him.
009	1SA	001	024	And she went up with him to Selom with a calf of three years old, and loaves, and an ephah of fine flour, and a bottle of wine: and she entered into the house of the Lord in Selom, and the child with them.
009	1SA	001	025	And they brought him before the Lord; and his father slew his offering which he offered from year to year to the Lord; and he brought near the child, and slew the calf; and Anna the mother of the child brought him to Heli.
009	1SA	001	026	And she said, I pray thee, my lord, as thy soul liveth, I [am] the woman that stood in thy presence with thee while praying to the Lord.
009	1SA	001	027	For this child I prayed; and the Lord has given me my request that I asked of him.
009	1SA	001	028	And I lend him to the Lord all his days that he lives, a loan to the Lord: and she said,
009	1SA	002	001	My heart is established in the Lord, my horn is exalted in my God; my mouth is enlarged over my enemies, I have rejoiced in thy salvation.
009	1SA	002	002	For there is none holy as the Lord, and there is none righteous as our God; there is none holy besides thee.
009	1SA	002	003	Boast not, and utter not high things; let not high-sounding words come out of your mouth, for the Lord [is] a God of knowledge, and God prepares his own designs.
009	1SA	002	004	The bow of the mighty has waxed feeble, and the weak have girded themselves with strength.
009	1SA	002	005	They that were full of bread are brought low; and the hungry have forsaken the land; for the barren has born seven, and she that abounded in children has waxed feeble.
009	1SA	002	006	The Lord kills and makes alive; he brings down to the grave, and brings up.
009	1SA	002	007	The Lord makes poor, and makes rich; he brings low, and lifts up.
009	1SA	002	008	He lifts up the poor from the earth, and raises the needy from the dunghill; to seat him with the princes of the people, and causing them to inherit the throne of glory:
009	1SA	002	009	granting his petition to him that prays; and he blesses the years of the righteous, for by strength cannot man prevail.
009	1SA	002	010	The Lord will weaken his adversary; the Lord [is] holy. Let not the wise man boast in his wisdom, nor let the mighty man boast in his strength, and let not the rich man boast in his wealth; but let him that boasts boast in this, to understand and know the Lord, and to execute judgment and justice in the midst of the earth. The Lord has gone up to the heavens, and has thundered: he will judge the extremities of the earth, and he gives strength to our kings, and will exalt the horn of his Christ. And she left him there before the Lord,
009	1SA	002	011	and departed to Armathaim: and the child ministered in the presence of the Lord before Heli the priest.
009	1SA	002	012	And the sons of Heli the priest [were] evil sons, not knowing the Lord.
009	1SA	002	013	And the priest's claim from every one of the people that sacrificed [was this:] the servant of the priest came when the flesh was in seething, and a flesh-hook of three teeth [was] in his hand.
009	1SA	002	014	And he struck it into the great caldron, or into the brazen vessel, or into the pot, and whatever came up with the flesh-hook, the priest took for himself: so they did to all Israel that came to sacrifice to the Lord in Selom.
009	1SA	002	015	And before the fat was burnt for a sweet savour, the servant of the priest would come, and say to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest, and I will by no means take of thee sodden flesh out of the caldron.
009	1SA	002	016	And [if] the man that sacrificed said, First let the fat be burned, as it is fit, and take for thyself of all things which thy soul desires: then he would say, Nay, for thou shalt give it me now; and if not I will take it by force.
009	1SA	002	017	So the sin of the young men was very great before the Lord, for they set at nought the offering of the Lord.
009	1SA	002	018	And Samuel ministered before the Lord, a child girt with a linen ephod.
009	1SA	002	019	And his mother made him a little doublet, and brought it to him from year to year, in her going up in company with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.
009	1SA	002	020	And Heli blessed Helcana and his wife, saying The Lord recompense to thee seed of this woman, in return for the loan which thou hast lent to the Lord: and the man returned to his place.
009	1SA	002	021	And the Lord visited Anna, and she bore yet three sons, and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the Lord.
009	1SA	002	022	And Heli [was] very old, and he heard what his sons did to the children of Israel.
009	1SA	002	023	And he said to them, Why do ye according to this thing, which I hear from the mouth of all the people of the Lord?
009	1SA	002	024	Nay [my] sons, for the report which I hear [is] not good; do not so, for the reports which I hear [are] not good, so that the people do not serve God.
009	1SA	002	025	If a man should at all sin against another, then shall they pray for him to the Lord; but if a man sin against the Lord, who shall intreat for him? But they hearkened not to the voice of their father, because the Lord would by all means destroy them.
009	1SA	002	026	And the child Samuel advanced, and was in favour with God and with men.
009	1SA	002	027	And a man of God came to Heli, and said, Thus says the Lord, I plainly revealed myself to the house of thy father, when they were servants in Egypt to the house of Pharao.
009	1SA	002	028	And I chose the house of thy father out of all the tribes of Israel to minister to me in the priest's office, to go up to my altar, and to burn incense, and to wear an ephod. And I gave to the house of thy father all the offerings by fire of the children of Israel for food.
009	1SA	002	029	And wherefore hast thou looked upon my incense-offering and my meat-offering with a shameless eye, and hast honoured thy sons above me, so that they should bless themselves with the first-fruits of every sacrifice of Israel before me?
009	1SA	002	030	Therefore thus says the Lord God of Israel, I said, Thy house and the house of thy father shall pass before me for ever: but now the Lord says, That be far from me; for I will only honour them that honour me, and he that sets me at nought shall be despised.
009	1SA	002	031	Behold, the days come when I will destroy thy seed and the seed of thy father's house.
009	1SA	002	032	And thou shalt not have an old man in my house for ever.
009	1SA	002	033	And [if] I do not destroy a man of thine from my altar, [it shall be] that his eyes may fail and his soul may perish; and every one that remains in thy house shall fall by the sword of men.
009	1SA	002	034	And this which shall come upon thy two sons Ophni and Phinees shall be a sign to thee; in one day they shall both die.
009	1SA	002	035	And I will raise up to myself a faithful priest, who shall do all that is in my heart and in my soul; and I will build him a sure house, and he shall walk before my Christ for ever.
009	1SA	002	036	And it shall come to pass that he that survives in thy house, shall come to do obeisance before him for a little piece of silver, saying, Put me into one of thy priest's offices to eat bread.
009	1SA	003	001	And the child Samuel ministered to the Lord before Heli the priest: and the word of the Lord was precious in those days, there was no distinct vision.
009	1SA	003	002	And it came to pass at that time that Heli was sleeping in his place; and his eyes began to fail, and could not see.
009	1SA	003	003	And the lamp of God [was burning] before it was trimmed, and Samuel slept in the temple, where [was] the ark of God.
009	1SA	003	004	And the Lord called, Samuel, Samuel; and he said, Behold, [here am] I.
009	1SA	003	005	And he ran to Heli, and said, [Here am] I, for thou didst call me: and he said, I did not call thee; return, go to sleep; and he returned and went to sleep.
009	1SA	003	006	And the Lord called again, Samuel, Samuel: and he went to Heli the second time, and said, Behold [here am] I, for thou didst call me: and he said, I called thee not; return, go to sleep.
009	1SA	003	007	And [it was] before Samuel knew the Lord, and [before] the word of the Lord was revealed to him.
009	1SA	003	008	And the Lord called Samuel again for the third time: and he arose and went to Heli, and said, Behold, I [am here], for thou didst call me: and Heli perceived that the Lord [had] called the child.
009	1SA	003	009	And he said, Return, child, go to sleep; and it shall come to pass if he shall call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak for thy servant hears: and Samuel went and lay down in his place.
009	1SA	003	010	And the Lord came, and stood, and called him as before: and Samuel said, Speak, for thy servant hears.
009	1SA	003	011	And the Lord said to Samuel, Behold, I execute my words in Israel; whoever hears them, both his ears shall tingle.
009	1SA	003	012	In that day I will raise up against Heli all things that I have said against his house; I will begin, and I will make an end.
009	1SA	003	013	And I have told him that I will be avenged on his house perpetually for the iniquities of his sons, because his sons spoke evil against God, and he did not admonish them.
009	1SA	003	014	And [it shall] not [go on] so; I have sworn to the house of Eli, the iniquity of the house of Eli shall not be atoned for with incense or sacrifices for ever.
009	1SA	003	015	And Samuel slept till morning, and rose early in the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the Lord; and Samuel feared to tell [Heli] the vision.
009	1SA	003	016	And Heli said to Samuel, Samuel, [my] son; and he said, Behold, [here am] I.
009	1SA	003	017	And he said, What [was] the word that was spoken to thee? I pray thee hide it not from me: may God do these things to thee, and more also, if thou hide from me any thing of all the words that were spoken to thee in thine ears.
009	1SA	003	018	And Samuel reported all the words, and hid them not from him. And Heli said, He [is] the Lord, he shall do that which is good in his sight.
009	1SA	003	019	And Samuel grew, and the Lord was with him, and there did not fall one of his words to the ground.
009	1SA	003	020	And all Israel knew from Dan even to Bersabee, that Samuel [was] faithful as a prophet to the Lord.
009	1SA	003	021	And the Lord manifested himself again in Selom, for the Lord revealed himself to Samuel; and Samuel was accredited to all Israel as a prophet to the Lord from one end of the land to the other: and Heli [was] very old, and his sons kept advancing [in wickedness], and their way [was] evil before the Lord.
009	1SA	004	001	And it came to pass in those days that the Philistines gathered themselves together against Israel to war; and Israel went out to meet them and encamped at Abenezer, and the Philistines encamped in Aphec.
009	1SA	004	002	And the Philistines prepare to fight with Israel, and the battle was turned against them; and the men of Israel fell before the Philistines, and there were smitten in the battle in the field four thousand men.
009	1SA	004	003	And the people came to the camp, and the elders of Israel said, Why has the Lord caused us to fall this day before the Philistines? let us take the ark of our God out of Selom, and let it proceed from the midst of us, and it shall save us from the hand of our enemies.
009	1SA	004	004	And the people sent to Selom, and they take thence the ark of the Lord who dwells between the cherubs: and both the sons of Heli, Ophni and Phinees, [were] with the ark.
009	1SA	004	005	And it came to pass when the ark of the Lord entered into the camp, that all Israel cried out with a loud voice, and the earth resounded.
009	1SA	004	006	And the Philistines heard the cry, and the Philistines said, What [is] this great cry in the camp of the Hebrews: and they understood that the ark of the Lord was come into the camp.
009	1SA	004	007	And the Philistines feared, and said, These are the Gods that are come to them into the camp.
009	1SA	004	008	Woe to us, O Lord, deliver us to-day for such a thing has not happened aforetime: woe to us, who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty Gods? these [are] the Gods that smote Egypt with every plague, and in the wilderness.
009	1SA	004	009	Strengthen yourselves and behave yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye may not serve the Hebrews as they have served us, but be ye men and fight with them.
009	1SA	004	010	And they fought with them; and the men of Israel fall, and they fled every man to his ten; and there was a very great slaughter; and there fell of Israel thirty thousand fighting men.
009	1SA	004	011	And the ark of God was taken, and both the sons of Heli, Ophni, and Phinees, died.
009	1SA	004	012	And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the battle, and he came to Selom on that day: and his clothes [were] rent, and earth [was] upon his head.
009	1SA	004	013	And he came, an behold, Heli was upon the seat by the gate looking along the way, for his heart was greatly alarmed for the ark of God: and the man entered into the city to bring tidings; and the city cried out.
009	1SA	004	014	And Heli heard the sound of the cry, and said, What [is] the voice of this cry? and the men hasted and went in, and reported to Heli.
009	1SA	004	015	Now Heli [was] ninety years old, and his eyes were fixed, and he saw not.
009	1SA	004	016	And Heli said to them that stood round about him, What [is] the voice of this sound? And the man hasted and advanced to Heli, and said to him, I am he that is come out of the camp, and I have fled from the battle to-day: and Heli said, What [is] the even, [my] son?
009	1SA	004	017	And they young man answered and said, The men of Israel fled from the face of the Philistines, and there was a great slaughter among the people, and both thy sons are dead, and the ark of God is taken.
009	1SA	004	018	And it came to pass, when he mentioned the ark of God, that he fell from the seat backward near the gate, and his back was broken, and he died, for [he was] an old man and heavy: and he judged Israel twenty years.
009	1SA	004	019	And his daughter-in-law the wife of Phinees [was] with child, [about] to bring forth; and she heard the tidings, that the ark of God was taken, and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead; and she wept and was delivered, for her pains came upon her.
009	1SA	004	020	And in her time she was at the point of death; and the women that stood by her, said to her, Fear not, for thou hast born a son: but she answered not, and her heart did not regard it.
009	1SA	004	021	And she called the child Uaebarchaboth, because of the ark of God, and because of her father-in-law, and because of her husband.
009	1SA	004	022	And they said, The glory of Israel is departed, forasmuch as the ark of the Lord is taken.
009	1SA	005	001	And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it from Abenezer to Azotus.
009	1SA	005	002	And the Philistines took the ark of the Lord, and brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.
009	1SA	005	003	And the people of Azotus rose early, and entered into the house of Dagon; and looked, and behold, Dagon had fallen on his face before the ark of the Lord: and they lifted up Dagon, and set him in his place. And the hand of the Lord was heavy upon the Azotians, and he plagued them, and he smote them in their secret parts, Azotus and her coasts.
009	1SA	005	004	And it came to pass when they rose early in the morning, behold, Dagon had fallen on his face before the ark of the covenant of the Lord; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands [were] cut off each before the threshold, and both the wrists of his hands had fallen on the floor of the porch; only the stump of Dagon was left.
009	1SA	005	005	Therefore the priests of Dagon, and every one that enters into the house of Dagon, do not tread upon the threshold of the house of Dagon in Azotus until this day, for they step over.
009	1SA	005	006	And the hand of the Lord was heavy upon Azotus, and he brought evil upon them, and it burst out upon them into the ships, and mice sprang up in the midst of their country, and there was a great and indiscriminate mortality in the city.
009	1SA	005	007	And the men of Azotus saw that [it was] so, and they said, The ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us, for his hand [is] heavy upon us and upon Dagon our god.
009	1SA	005	008	And they send and gather the lords of the Philistines to them, and say, What shall we do to the ark of the God of Israel? and the Gittites say, Let the ark of God come over to us; and the ark of the God of Israel came to Geth.
009	1SA	005	009	And it came to pass after it went about to Geth, that the hand of the Lord comes upon the city, a very great confusion; and he smote the men of the city small and great, and smote them in their secret parts: and the Gittites made to themselves images of emerods.
009	1SA	005	010	And they send away the ark of God to Ascalon; and it came to pass when the ark of God went into Ascalon, that the men of Ascalon cried out, saying, Why have ye brought back the ark of the God of Israel to us, to kill us and our people?
009	1SA	005	011	And they send and gather the lords of the Philistines, and they said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it lodge in its place; and let it not slay us and our people.
009	1SA	005	012	For there was a very great confusion in all the city, when the ark of the God of Israel entered there; and those, who lived and died not were smitten with emerods; and the cry of the city went up to heaven.
009	1SA	006	001	And the ark was seven months in the country of the Philistines, and their land brought forth swarms of mice.
009	1SA	006	002	And the Philistines call their priests, and their prophets, and their enchanters, saying, What shall we do to the ark of the Lord? teach us wherewith we shall send it away to its place.
009	1SA	006	003	And they said, If ye send away the ark of the covenant of the Lord God of Israel, do not on any account send it away empty, but by all means render to it an offering for the plague; and then shall ye be healed, and an atonement shall be made for you: should not his hand be [thus] stayed from off you?
009	1SA	006	004	And they say, What [is] the offering for the plague [which] we shall return to it? and they said,
009	1SA	006	005	According to the number of the lords of the Philistines, five golden emerods, for the plague was on you, and on your rulers, and on the people; and golden mice, the likeness of the mice that destroy your land: and ye shall give glory to the Lord, that he may lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land.
009	1SA	006	006	And why do ye harden your hearts, as Egypt and Pharao hardened their hearts? [was it] not [so] when he mocked them, [that] they let the people go, and they departed?
009	1SA	006	007	And now take wood and make a new wagon, and take two cows, that have calved for the first time, without their calves; and do ye yoke the cows to the wagon, and lead away the calves from behind them home.
009	1SA	006	008	And ye shall take the ark and put it on the wagon; and ye shall restore to it the golden articles for the trespass-offering in a coffer by the side of it: and ye shall let it go, and sent it away, and ye shall depart.
009	1SA	006	009	And ye shall see, if it shall go the way of its coasts along by Baethsamys, he has brought upon us this great affliction; and if not, then shall we know that his hand has not touched us, but this [is a] chance [which] has happened to us.
009	1SA	006	010	And the Philistines did so; and they took two cows that had calved for the first time, and yoked them to the waggon, and shut up their calves at home.
009	1SA	006	011	And they set the ark of the Lord, and the coffer, and the golden mice, on the waggon.
009	1SA	006	012	And the cows went straight on the way to the way of Baethsamys, they went along one track; and laboured, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left, and the lords of the Philistines went after it as far as the coasts of Baethsamys.
009	1SA	006	013	And the men of Baethsamys were reaping the wheat harvest in the valley; and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark of the Lord, and rejoiced to meet it.
009	1SA	006	014	And the waggon entered into the field of Osee, which was in Baethsamys, and they set there by it a great stone; and they split the wood of the waggon, and offered up the cows for a whole-burnt-offering to the Lord.
009	1SA	006	015	And the Levites brought up the ark of the Lord, and the coffer with it, and the golden articles upon it, and placed them on the great stone, and the men of Baethsamys offered whole-burnt-offerings and meat offerings on that day to the Lord.
009	1SA	006	016	And the five lords of the Philistines saw, and returned to Ascalon in that day.
009	1SA	006	017	And these [are] the golden emerods which the lords of the Philistines gave as a trespass-offering to the Lord; for Azotus one, for Gaza one, for Ascalon one, for Geth one, for Accaron one.
009	1SA	006	018	And the golden mice according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines, belonging to the five lords, from the fenced city to the village of the Pherezite, and to the great stone, on which they placed the ark of the covenant of the Lord, that was in the field of Osee the Baethsamysite.
009	1SA	006	019	And the sons of Jechonias were not pleased with the men of Baethsamys, because they saw the ark of the Lord; and [the Lord] smote among them seventy men, and fifty thousand men: and the people mourned, because the Lord had inflicted on the people, a very great plague.
009	1SA	006	020	And the men of Baethsamys said, Who shall be able to pass before this holy Lord God? and to whom shall the ark of the Lord go up from us?
009	1SA	006	021	And they send messengers to the inhabitants of Cariathiarim, saying, The Philistines have brought back the ark of the Lord, go down and take it home to yourselves.
009	1SA	007	001	And the men of Cariathiarim come, and bring up the ark of the covenant of the Lord: and they bring it into the house of Aminadab in the hill; and they sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the covenant of the Lord.
009	1SA	007	002	And it came to pass from the time that the ark was in Cariathiarim, the days were multiplied, and [the time] was twenty years; and all the house of Israel looked after the Lord.
009	1SA	007	003	And Samuel spoke to all the house of Israel, saying, If ye do with all your heart return to the Lord, take away the strange gods from the midst of you, and the groves, and prepare your hearts to [serve] the Lord, and serve him only; and he shall deliver you from the hand of the Philistines.
009	1SA	007	004	And the children of Israel took away Baalim and the groves of Astaroth, and served the Lord only.
009	1SA	007	005	And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Massephath, and I will pray for you to the Lord.
009	1SA	007	006	And they were gathered together to Massephath, and they drew water, and poured it out upon the earth before the Lord. And they fasted on that day, and said, We have sinned before the Lord. And Samuel judged the children of Israel in Massephath.
009	1SA	007	007	And the Philistines heard that all the children of Israel were gathered together to Massephath: and the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel: and the children of Israel heard, and they feared before the Philistines.
009	1SA	007	008	And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to cry to the Lord thy God for us, and he shall save us out of the hand of the Philistines.
009	1SA	007	009	And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it up as a whole-burnt-offering with all the people to the Lord: and Samuel cried to the Lord for Israel, and the Lord heard him.
009	1SA	007	010	And Samuel was offering the whole-burnt-offering; and the Philistines drew near to war against Israel; and the Lord thundered with a mighty sound in that day upon the Philistines, and they were confounded and overthrown before Israel.
009	1SA	007	011	And the men of Israel went forth out of Massephath, and pursued the Philistines, and smote them to the parts under Baethchor.
009	1SA	007	012	And Samuel took a stone, and set it up between Massephath and the old [city]; and he called the name of it Abenezer, stone of the helper; and he said, Hitherto has the Lord helped us.
009	1SA	007	013	So the Lord humbled the Philistines, and they did not anymore come into the border of Israel; and the hand of the Lord was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.
009	1SA	007	014	And the cities which the Philistines took from the children of Israel were restored; and they restored them to Israel from Ascalon to Azob: and they took the coast of Israel out of the hand of the Philistines; and there was peace between Israel and the Amorite.
009	1SA	007	015	And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.
009	1SA	007	016	And he went year by year, and went round Baethel, and Galgala, and Massephath; and he judged Israel in all these consecrated places.
009	1SA	007	017	And his return was to Armathaim, because there was his house; and there he judged Israel, and built there an altar to the Lord.
009	1SA	008	001	And it came to pass when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel.
009	1SA	008	002	And these [are] the names of his sons; Joel the first-born, and the name of the second Abia, judges in Bersabee.
009	1SA	008	003	And his sons did not walk in his way; and they turned aside after gain, and took gifts, and perverted judgments.
009	1SA	008	004	And the men of Israel gather themselves together, and come to Armathaim to Samuel,
009	1SA	008	005	and they said to him, Behold, thou art grown old, and thy sons walk not in thy way; and now set over us a king to judge us, as also the other nations [have].
009	1SA	008	006	And the thing [was] evil in the eyes of Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us: and Samuel prayed to the Lord.
009	1SA	008	007	And the Lord said to Samuel, Hear the voice of the people, in whatever they shall say to thee; for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me from reigning over them.
009	1SA	008	008	According to all their doings which they have done to me, from the day that I brought them out of Egypt until this day, even [as] they have deserted me, and served other gods, so they do also to thee.
009	1SA	008	009	And now hearken to their voice; only thou shalt solemnly testify to them, and thou shalt describe to them the manner of the king who shall reign over them.
009	1SA	008	010	And Samuel spoke every word of the Lord to the people who asked of him a king.
009	1SA	008	011	And he said, This shall be the manner of the king that shall rule over you: he shall take your sons, and put them in his chariots, and among his horsemen, and running before his chariots,
009	1SA	008	012	and [his manner shall be] to make them to himself captains of hundreds and captains of thousands; and to reap his harvest, and gather his vintage, and prepare his instruments of war, and the implements of his chariots.
009	1SA	008	013	And he will take your daughters to be perfumers, and cooks, and bakers.
009	1SA	008	014	And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your good oliveyards, and give them to his servants.
009	1SA	008	015	And he will take the tithe of your seeds and your vineyards, and give [it] to his eunuchs, and to his servants.
009	1SA	008	016	And he will take your servants, and your handmaids, and your good herds and your asses, and will take the tenth of them for his works.
009	1SA	008	017	And he will tithe your flocks; and ye shall be his servants.
009	1SA	008	018	And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king whom ye have chosen to yourselves, and the Lord shall not hear you in those days, because ye have chosen to yourselves a king.
009	1SA	008	019	But the people would not hearken to Samuel; and they said to him, Nay, but there shall be a king over us.
009	1SA	008	020	An we also will be like all the nations; and our king shall judge us, and shall go out before us, and fight our battles.
009	1SA	008	021	And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and spoke them in the ears of the Lord.
009	1SA	008	022	And the Lord said to Samuel, Hearken to their voice, and appoint them a king. And Samuel said to the men of Israel, Let each man depart to his city.
009	1SA	009	001	And [there was] a man of the sons of Benjamin, and his name [was] Kis, the son of Abiel, the son of Jared, the son of Bachir, the son of Aphec, the son of a Benjamite, a man of might.
009	1SA	009	002	And this man [had] a son, and his name was Saul, of great stature, a goodly man; and there was not among the sons of Israel a goodlier than he, high above all the people from his shoulders and upward.
009	1SA	009	003	And the asses of Kis the father of Saul were lost; and Kis said to Saul his son, Take with thee one of the young men, and arise ye, and go seek the asses.
009	1SA	009	004	And they went through mount Ephraim, and they went through the land of Selcha, and found them not: and they passed through the land of Segalim, and they were not there: and they passed through the land of Jamin, and found them not.
009	1SA	009	005	And when they came to Siph, then Saul said to his young man that was with him, Come and let us return, lest my father leave the asses, and take care for us.
009	1SA	009	006	And the young man said to him, Behold now, [there is] a man of God in this city, and the man [is] of high repute; all that he shall speak will surely come to pass: now then let us go, that he may tell us our way on which we have set out.
009	1SA	009	007	And Saul said to his young man that was with him, Lo, then, we will go; but what shall we bring the man of God? for the loaves are spent out of our vessels, and we have nothing more with us that belongs to us to bring to the man of God.
009	1SA	009	008	And the young man answered Saul again, and said, Behold, there is found in my hand a fourth part of a shekel of silver; and thou shalt give it to the man of God, and he shall tell us our way.
009	1SA	009	009	Now before time in Israel every one in going to enquire of God said, Come and let us go to the seer; for the people beforetime called the prophet, the seer.
009	1SA	009	010	And Saul said to his servant, Well said, come and let us go: and they went to the city where the man of God was.
009	1SA	009	011	As they went up the ascent to the city, they find damsels come out to draw water, and they say to them, Is the seer here?
009	1SA	009	012	And the virgins answered them, and they say to them, He is: behold, [he is] before you: now he is coming to the city, because of the day, for to-day [there is] a sacrifice for the people in Bama.
009	1SA	009	013	As soon as ye shall enter into the city, so shall ye find him in the city, before he goes up to Bama to eat; for the people will not eat until he comes in, for he blesses the sacrifice, and afterwards the guests eat; now then go up, for ye shall find him because of the holiday.
009	1SA	009	014	And they go up to the city; and as they were entering into the midst of the city, behold, Samuel came out to meet them, to go up to Bama.
009	1SA	009	015	And the Lord uncovered the ear of Samuel one day before Saul came to him, saying,
009	1SA	009	016	At this time to-morrow I will send to thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him to be ruler over my people Israel, and he shall save my people out of the hand of the Philistines; for I have looked upon the humiliation of my people, for their cry is come unto me.
009	1SA	009	017	And Samuel looked upon Saul, and the Lord answered him, Behold the man of whom I spoke to thee, this one shall rule over my people.
009	1SA	009	018	And Saul drew near to Samuel into the midst of the city, and said, Tell me now which [is] the house of the seer?
009	1SA	009	019	And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am he: go up before me to Bama, and eat with me to-day, and I will send thee away in the morning, and I will tell thee all that is in thine heart.
009	1SA	009	020	And concerning thine asses that have been lost now these three days, care not for them, for they are found. And to whom does the excellency of Israel belong? does it not to thee and to thy father's house?
009	1SA	009	021	And Saul answered and said, Am not I the son of a Benjamite, the least tribe of the people of Israel? and of the least family of the whole tribe of Benjamin? and why hast thou spoken to me according to this word?
009	1SA	009	022	And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them to the inn, and set them there a place among the chief of those that were called, about seventy men.
009	1SA	009	023	And Samuel said to the cook, Give me the portion which I gave thee, which I told thee to set by thee.
009	1SA	009	024	Now the cook [had] boiled the shoulder, and he set it before Saul; and Samuel said to Saul, Behold that which is left: set before thee, an eat; for it is set thee for a testimony in preference to the others; take [of it]: and Saul ate with Samuel on that day.
009	1SA	009	025	And he went down from Bama into the city; and they prepared a lodging for Saul on the roof, and he lay down.
009	1SA	009	026	An it came to pass when the morning dawned, that Samuel called Saul on the roof, saying, Rise up, and I will dismiss thee. And Saul arose, and he and Samuel went out.
009	1SA	009	027	As they went down to a part of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Speak to the young man, and let him pass on before us; and do thou stand as to-day, and hearken to the word of God.
009	1SA	010	001	And Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured [it] on his head, and kissed him, and said to him, Has not the Lord anointed thee for a ruler over his people, over Israel? and thou shalt rule among the people of the Lord, and thou shalt save them out of the hand of their enemies; and this [shall be] the sign to thee that the Lord has anointed thee for a ruler over his inheritance.
009	1SA	010	002	[As soon] as thou shalt have departed this day from me, thou shalt find two men by the burial-place of Rachel on the mount of Benjamin, exulting greatly; and they shall say to thee, The asses are found which ye went to seek; and, behold, thy father has given up the matter of the asses, and he is anxious for you, saying, What shall I do for my son?
009	1SA	010	003	And thou shalt depart thence, and shalt go beyond that as far as the oak of Thabor, and thou shalt find there three men going up to God to Baethel, one bearing three kids, and another bearing three vessels of bread, and another bearing a bottle of wine.
009	1SA	010	004	And they shall ask thee how thou doest, and shall give thee two presents of bread, and thou shall receive them of their hand.
009	1SA	010	005	And afterward thou shalt go to the hill of God, where is the encampment of the Philistines; there [is] Nasib the Philistine: an it shall come to pass when ye shall have entered into the city, that thou shalt meet a band of prophets coming down from the Bama; and before them will be lutes, and a drum, and a pipe, and a harp, and they shall prophesy.
009	1SA	010	006	And the Spirit of the Lord shall come upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man.
009	1SA	010	007	And it shall come to pass when these signs shall come upon thee, —[then] do thou whatsoever thy hand shall find, because God [is] with thee.
009	1SA	010	008	And thou shalt go down in front of Galgal, and behold, I come down to thee to offer a whole-burnt-offering and peace-offerings: seven days shalt thou wait until I shall come to thee, and I will make known to thee what thou shalt do.
009	1SA	010	009	And it came to pass when he turned his back to depart from Samuel, God gave him another heart; and all these signs came to pass in that day.
009	1SA	010	010	And he comes thence to the hill, and behold a band of prophets opposite to him; and the Spirit of God came upon him, and he prophesied in the midst of them.
009	1SA	010	011	And all that had known him before came, and saw, and behold, he [was] in the midst of the prophets: and the people said every one to his neighbour, What [is] this that has happened to the son of Kis? [is] Saul also among the prophets?
009	1SA	010	012	And one of them answered and said, And who [is] his father? and therefore it became a proverb, [Is] Saul also among the prophets?
009	1SA	010	013	And he ceased prophesying, and comes to the hill.
009	1SA	010	014	And his kinsman said to him and to his servant, Whither went ye? and they said, To seek the asses; and we saw that they were lost, and we went in to Samuel.
009	1SA	010	015	And his kinsman said to Saul, Tell me, I pray thee, What did Samuel say to thee?
009	1SA	010	016	And Saul said to his kinsman, he verily told me that the asses were found. But the matter of the kingdom he told him not.
009	1SA	010	017	And Samuel summoned all the people before the Lord to Massephath.
009	1SA	010	018	And he said to the children of Israel, Thus has the Lord God of Israel spoken, saying, I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, and I rescued you out of the hand of Pharao king of Egypt, and out of all the kingdoms that afflicted you.
009	1SA	010	019	And ye have this day rejected God, who is himself your Deliverer out of all your evils and afflictions; and ye said, Nay, but thou shalt set a king over us: and now stand before the Lord according to your tribes, and according to your families.
009	1SA	010	020	And Samuel brought nigh all the tribes of Israel, and the tribe of Benjamin is taken by lot.
009	1SA	010	021	And he brings near the tribe of Benjamin by families, and the family of Mattari is taken by lot: and they bring near the family of Mattari, man by man, and Saul the son of Kis is taken; and he sought him, but he was not found.
009	1SA	010	022	And Samuel asked yet again of the Lord, Will the man come hither? and the Lord said, Behold, he is hid among the stuff.
009	1SA	010	023	And he ran and took him thence, and he set him in the midst of the people; and he was higher than all the people by his shoulders and upwards.
009	1SA	010	024	And Samuel said to all the people, Have ye seen whom the Lord has chosen to himself, that there is none like to him among you all? And all the people took notice, and said, Let the king live!
009	1SA	010	025	And Samuel told the people the manner of the king, and wrote it in a book, and set it before the Lord: and Samuel sent away all the people, and each went to his place.
009	1SA	010	026	And Saul departed to his house to Gabaa; and there went with Saul mighty men whose hearts God had touched.
009	1SA	010	027	But evil men said, Who [is] this man [that] shall save us? and they despised him, and brought him no gifts.
009	1SA	011	001	And it came to pass about a month after this, that Naas the Ammanite went up, and encamped against Jabis Galaad: and all the men of Jabis said to Naas the Ammanite, Make a covenant with us, and we will serve thee.
009	1SA	011	002	Naas the Ammanite said to them, On these terms will I make a covenant with you, that I should put out all your right eyes, and I will lay a reproach upon Israel.
009	1SA	011	003	And the men of Jabis say to him, Allow us seven days, and we will send messengers into all the coasts of Israel: if there should be no one to deliver us, we will come out to you.
009	1SA	011	004	And the messengers came to Gabaa to Saul, and they speak the words into the ears of the people; and all the people lifted up their voice, and wept.
009	1SA	011	005	And, behold, Saul came after the early morning out of the field: and Saul said, Why does the people week? and they tell him the words of the men of Jabis.
009	1SA	011	006	And the Spirit of the Lord came upon Saul when he heard these words, and his anger was greatly kindled against them.
009	1SA	011	007	And he took two cows, and cut them in pieces, and sent them into all the coasts of Israel by the hand of messengers, saying, Whoso comes not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall they do to his oxen: and a transport from the Lord came upon the people of Israel, and they came out to battle as one man.
009	1SA	011	008	And he reviews them at Bezec in Bama, every man of Israel six hundred thousand, and the men of Juda seventy thousand.
009	1SA	011	009	And he said to the messengers that came, Thus shall ye say to the men of Jabis, To-morrow ye shall have deliverance when the sun is hot; and the messengers came to the city, and told the men of Jabis, and they rejoiced.
009	1SA	011	010	And the men of Jabis said to Naas the Ammanite, To-morrow we will come forth to you, and ye shall do to us what seems good in your sight.
009	1SA	011	011	And it came to pass on the morrow, that Saul divided the people into three companies, and they go into the midst of the camp in the morning watch, and they smote the children of Ammon until the day was hot; at it came to pass that those who were left were scattered, and there were not left among them two together.
009	1SA	011	012	And the people said to Samuel, Who has said that Saul shall not reign over us? Give up the men, and we will put them to death.
009	1SA	011	013	And Saul said, No man shall die this day, for to-day the Lord has wrought deliverance in Israel.
009	1SA	011	014	And Samuel spoke to the people, saying, Let us go to Galgala, and there renew the kingdom.
009	1SA	011	015	And all the people went to Galgala, and Samuel anointed Saul there to be king before the Lord in Galgala, and there he offered meat-offerings and peace-offerings before the Lord: and Samuel and all Israel rejoiced exceedingly.
009	1SA	012	001	And Samuel said to all Israel, Behold, I have hearkened to your voice in all things that ye have said to me, and I have set a king over you.
009	1SA	012	002	And now, behold, the king goes before you; and I am grown old and shall rest; and, behold, my sons [are] among you; and, behold, I have gone about before you from my youth to this day.
009	1SA	012	003	Behold, [here am] I, answer against me before the Lord and before his anointed: whose calf have I taken? or whose ass have I taken? or whom of you have I oppressed? or from whose hand have I taken a bribe, even [to] a sandal? bear witness against me, and I will make restitution to you.
009	1SA	012	004	And they said to Samuel, Thou hast not injured us, and thou hast not oppressed us; and thou hast not afflicted us, and thou hast not taken anything from any one's hand.
009	1SA	012	005	And Samuel said to the people, The Lord [is] witness among you, and his anointed [is] witness this day, that ye have not found anything in my hand: and they said, [He is] witness.
009	1SA	012	006	And Samuel spoke to the people, saying, The Lord who appointed Moses and Aaron [is] witness, who brought our fathers up out of Egypt.
009	1SA	012	007	And now stand still, and I will judge you before the Lord; and I will relate to you all the righteousness of the Lord, the things which he has wrought among you and your fathers.
009	1SA	012	008	When Jacob and his sons went into Egypt, and Egypt humbled them, then our fathers cried to the Lord, and the Lord sent Moses and Aaron; and they brought our fathers out of Egypt, and he made them to dwell in this place.
009	1SA	012	009	And they forgot the Lord their God, and he sold them into the hands of Sisara captain of the host of Jabis king of Asor, and into the hands of the Philistines, and into the hands of the king of Moab; and he fought with them.
009	1SA	012	010	And they cried to the Lord, and said, We have sinned, for we have forsaken the Lord, and have served Baalim and the groves: and now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve thee.
009	1SA	012	011	And he sent Jerobaal, and Barac, and Jephthae, and Samuel, and rescued us out of the hand of our enemies round about, and ye dwelt in security.
009	1SA	012	012	And ye saw that Naas king of the children of Ammon came against you, and ye said, Nay, none but a king shall reign over us; whereas the Lord our God [is] our king.
009	1SA	012	013	And now behold the king whom ye have chosen; and behold, the Lord has set a king over you.
009	1SA	012	014	If ye should fear the Lord, and serve him, and hearken to his voice, and not resist the mouth of the Lord, and ye and your king that reigns over you should follow the Lord, [well].
009	1SA	012	015	But if ye should not hearken to the voice of the Lord, and ye should resist the mouth of the Lord, then shall the hand of the Lord be upon you and upon your king.
009	1SA	012	016	And now stand still, and see this great thing, which the Lord will do before your eyes.
009	1SA	012	017	[Is it] not wheat-harvest to-day? I will call upon the Lord, and he shall send thunder and rain; and know ye and see, that your wickedness [is] great which ye have wrought before the Lord, having asked for yourselves a king.
009	1SA	012	018	And Samuel called upon the Lord, and the Lord sent thunders and rain in that day; and all the people feared greatly the Lord and Samuel.
009	1SA	012	019	And all the people said to Samuel, Pray for thy servants to the Lord thy God, and let us not die; for we have added to all our sins this iniquity, in asking for us a king.
009	1SA	012	020	And Samuel said to the people, Fear not: ye have [indeed] wrought all this iniquity; only turn not from following the Lord, and serve the Lord with all your heart.
009	1SA	012	021	And turn not aside after the [gods] that are nothing, who will do nothing, and will not deliver [you], because they are nothing.
009	1SA	012	022	For the Lord will not cast off his people for his great name's sake, because the Lord graciously took you to himself for a people.
009	1SA	012	023	And far be it from me to sin against the Lord in ceasing to pray for you: but I will serve the Lord, and shew you the good and the right way.
009	1SA	012	024	Only fear the Lord, and serve him in truth and with all your heart, for ye see what great things he has wrought with you.
009	1SA	012	025	But if ye continue to do evil, then shall ye and your king be consumed.
009	1SA	013	001	And Saul chooses for himself three thousand men of the men of Israel: and there were with Saul two thousand who were in Machmas, and in mount Baethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gabaa of Benjamin: and he sent the rest of the people every man to his tent.
009	1SA	013	003	And Jonathan smote Nasib the Philistine that dwelt in the hill; and the Philistines hear of it, and Saul sounds the trumpet through all the land, saying, The servants have despised [us].
009	1SA	013	004	And all Israel heard say, Saul has smitten Nasib the Philistine; now Israel had been put to shame before the Philistines; and the children of Israel went up after Saul in Galgala.
009	1SA	013	005	And the Philistines gather together to war with Israel; and then come up against Israel thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand by the seashore for multitude: and they come up, and encamp in Machmas, opposite Baethoron southward.
009	1SA	013	006	And the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait so that they could not draw nigh, and the people hid themselves in caves, and sheepfolds, and rocks, and ditches, and pits.
009	1SA	013	007	And they that went over went over Jordan to the land of Gad and Galaad: and Saul was yet in Galgala, and all the people followed after him in amazement.
009	1SA	013	008	And he continued seven days for the appointed testimony, as Samuel told him, and Samuel came not to Galgala, and his people were dispersed from him.
009	1SA	013	009	And Saul said, Bring hither [victims], that I may offer whole-burnt-offerings and peace-offerings: and he offered the whole-burnt-offering.
009	1SA	013	010	And it came to pass when he had finished offering the whole-burnt-offering, that Samuel arrived, and Saul went out to meet him, [and] to bless him.
009	1SA	013	011	And Samuel said, What hast thou done? and Saul said, Because I saw how the people were scattered from me, and thou was not present as thou purposedst according to the set time of the days, and the Philistines were gathered to Machmas.
009	1SA	013	012	Then I said, Now will the Philistines come down to me to Galgala, and I have not sought the face of the Lord: so I forced myself and offered the whole-burnt-offering.
009	1SA	013	013	And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly; for thou hast not kept my command, which the Lord commanded thee, as now the Lord would have confirmed thy kingdom over Israel for ever.
009	1SA	013	014	But now thy kingdom shall not stand to thee, and the Lord shall seek for himself a man after his own heart; and the Lord shall appoint him to be a ruler over his people, because thou hast not kept all that the Lord commanded thee.
009	1SA	013	015	And Samuel arose, and departed from Galgala, and the remnant of the people went after Saul to meet [him] after the men of war, when they had come out of Galgala to Gabaa of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people that were found with him, about six hundred men.
009	1SA	013	016	And Saul and Jonathan his son, and the people that were found with them, halted in Gabaa, of Benjamin; and they wept: and the Philistines had encamped in Machmas.
009	1SA	013	017	And men came forth to destroy out of the land of the Philistines in three companies; one company turning by the way of Gophera toward the land of Sogal,
009	1SA	013	018	and another company turning the way of Baethoron, and another company turning by the way of Gabae that turns aside to Gai of Sabim.
009	1SA	013	019	And there was not found a smith in all the land of Israel, for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make themselves sword or spear.
009	1SA	013	020	And all Israel went down to the Land of the Philistines to forge every one his reaping-hook and his tool, and every one his axe and his sickle.
009	1SA	013	021	And it was near the time of vintage: and their tools were [valued at] three shekels for a plough-share, and there was the same rate for the axe and the sickle.
009	1SA	013	022	And it came to pass in the days of the war of Machmas, that there was not a sword or spear found in the hand of all the people, that were with Saul and Jonathan; but with Saul and Jonathan his son was there found.
009	1SA	013	023	And there went out some from the camp of the Philistines to the place beyond Machmas.
009	1SA	014	001	And when a certain day arrived, Jonathan the son of Saul said to the young man that bore his armour, Come, and let us go over to Messab of the Philistines that is on the other side yonder; but he told not his father.
009	1SA	014	002	And Saul sat on the top of the hill under the pomegranate tree that is in Magdon, and there were with him about six hundred men.
009	1SA	014	003	And Achia son of Achitob, the brother of Jochabed the son of Phinees, the son of Heli, [was] the priest of God in Selom wearing an ephod: and the people knew not that Jonathan was gone.
009	1SA	014	004	And in the midst of the passage whereby Jonathan sought to pass over to the encampment of the Philistines, there was both a sharp rock on this side, and a sharp rock on the other side: the name of the one [was] Bases, and the name of the other Senna.
009	1SA	014	005	The one way [was] northward to one coming to Machmas, and the other way [was] southward to one coming to Gabae.
009	1SA	014	006	And Jonathan said to the young man that bore his armour, Come, let us go over to Messab of these uncircumcised, if [peradventure] the Lord may do something for us; for the Lord is not straitened to save by many or by few.
009	1SA	014	007	And his armour-bearer said to him, Do all that thine heart inclines toward: behold, I [am] with thee, my heart [is] as thy heart.
009	1SA	014	008	And Jonathan said, Behold, we will go over to the men, and will come down suddenly upon them.
009	1SA	014	009	If they should say thus to us, Stand aloof there until we shall send you word; then we will stand still by ourselves, and will not go up against them.
009	1SA	014	010	[But] if they should say thus to us, Come up to us; then will we go up, for the Lord has delivered them into our hands; this [shall be] a sign to us.
009	1SA	014	011	And they both went in to Messab of the Philistines; and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of their Caves, where they had hidden themselves.
009	1SA	014	012	And the men of Messab answered Jonathan and his armour-bearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will shew you a thing: and Jonathan said to his armour-bearer, Come up after me, for the Lord has delivered them into the hands of Israel.
009	1SA	014	013	And Jonathan went up on his hands and feet, and his armour-bearer with him; and they looked on the face of Jonathan, and he smote them, and his armour-bearer did smite [them] after him.
009	1SA	014	014	And the first slaughter which Jonathan and his armour-bearer effected was twenty men, with darts and slings, and pebbles of the field.
009	1SA	014	015	And there was dismay in the camp, and in the field; and all the people in Messab, and the spoilers were amazed; and they would not act, and the land was terror-struck, and there was dismay from the lord.
009	1SA	014	016	And the watchmen of Saul beheld in Gabaa of Benjamin, and, behold, the army was thrown into confusion on every side.
009	1SA	014	017	And Saul said to the people with him, Number yourselves now, and see who has gone out from you: and they numbered themselves, and behold, Jonathan and his armour-bearer were not found.
009	1SA	014	018	And Saul said to Achia, Bring the ephod; for he wore the ephod in that day before Israel.
009	1SA	014	019	And it came to pass while Saul was speaking to the priest, that the sound in the camp of the Philistines continued to increase greatly; and Saul said to the priest, Withdraw thy hands.
009	1SA	014	020	And Saul went up and all the people that were with him, and they come to the battle: and, behold, [every] man's sword was against his neighbour, a very great confusion.
009	1SA	014	021	And the servants who had been before with the Philistines, who had gone up to the army, turned themselves also to be with the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan.
009	1SA	014	022	And all the Israelites who were hidden in mount Ephraim heard also that the Philistines fled; and they also gather themselves after them to battle: and the Lord saved Israel in that day; and the war passed through Bamoth; and all the people with Saul were about ten thousand men.
009	1SA	014	023	And the battle extended itself to every city in the mount Ephraim.
009	1SA	014	024	And Saul committed a great trespass of ignorance in that day, and he lays a curse on the people, saying, Cursed [is] the man who shall eat bread before the evening; so I will avenge myself on my enemy: and none of the people tasted bread, though all the land was dining.
009	1SA	014	025	And Jaal was a wood abounding in swarms of bees on the face of the ground.
009	1SA	014	026	And the people went into the place of the bees, and, behold, they continued speaking; and, behold, there was none that put his hand to his mouth, for the people feared the oath of the Lord.
009	1SA	014	027	And Jonathan had not heard when his father adjured the people; and he reached forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, an dipped it into the honeycomb, and returned his hand to his mouth, and his eyes recovered their sight.
009	1SA	014	028	And one of the people answered and said, Thy father solemnly adjured the people, saying, Cursed [is] the man who shall eat bread to-day. And the people were very faint,
009	1SA	014	029	and Jonathan knew it, and said, My father has destroyed the land: see how my eyes have received sight [now] that I have tasted a little of this honey.
009	1SA	014	030	Surely if the people had this day eaten freely of the spoils of their enemies which they found, the slaughter among the Philistines would have been greater.
009	1SA	014	031	And on that day he smote some of the Philistines in Machmas; and the people were very weary.
009	1SA	014	032	And the people turned to the spoil; and the people took flocks, and herds, and calves, and slew them on the ground, and the people ate with the blood.
009	1SA	014	033	And it was reported to Saul, saying, The people have sinned against the Lord, eating with the blood: and Saul said, Out of Getthaim roll a great stone to me hither.
009	1SA	014	034	And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and tell them to bring hither every one his calf, and every one his sheep: and let them slay it on this [stone] and sin not against the Lord in eating with the blood: and the people brought each one that which was in his hand, and they slew [them] there.
009	1SA	014	035	And Saul built an altar there to the Lord: this was the first altar that Saul built to the Lord.
009	1SA	014	036	And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines this night, and let us plunder among them till the day break, and let us not leave a man among them. And they said, Do all that is good in thy sight: and the priest said, let us draw nigh hither to God.
009	1SA	014	037	And Saul enquired of God, If I go down after the Philistines, wilt thou deliver them into the hands of Israel? And he answered him not in that day.
009	1SA	014	038	And Saul said, Bring hither all the chiefs of Israel, and know and see by whom this sin has been committed this day.
009	1SA	014	039	For as the Lord lives who has saved Israel, if answer should be against my son Jonathan, he shall surely die. And there was no one that answered out of all the people.
009	1SA	014	040	And he said to all the men of Israel, Ye shall be under subjection, and I an Jonathan my son will be under subjection: and the people said to Saul, Do that which is good in thy sight.
009	1SA	014	041	And Saul said, O Lord God of Israel, why hast thou not answered thy servant this day? [is] the iniquity in me, or in Jonathan my son? Lord God of Israel, give clear [manifestations]; and if [the lot] should declare this, give, I pray thee, to thy people of Israel, give, I pray, holiness. And Jonathan and Saul are taken, and the people escaped.
009	1SA	014	042	And Saul said, Cast [lots] between me and my son Jonathan: whomsoever the Lord shall cause to be taken by lot, let him die: and the people said to Saul, This thing is not [to be done]: and Saul prevailed against the people, and they cast [lots] between him and Jonathan his son, and Jonathan is taken by lot.
009	1SA	014	043	And Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done: and Jonathan told him, and said, I did indeed taste a little honey, with the end of my staff that was in my hand, and, lo! I [am to] die.
009	1SA	014	044	And Saul said to him, God do so to me, and more also, thou shalt surely die to-day.
009	1SA	014	045	And the people said to Saul, Shall he that has wrought this great salvation in Israel be put to death this day? [As] the Lord lives, there shall not fall to the ground one of the hairs of his head; for the people of God have wrought successfully this day. And the people prayed for Jonathan in that day, and he died not.
009	1SA	014	046	And Saul went up from following the Philistines; and the Philistines departed to their place.
009	1SA	014	047	And Saul received the kingdom, by lot he inherits the office [of ruling] over Israel: and he fought against all his enemies round about, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against the children of Edom, and against Baethaeor, and against the king of Suba, and against the Philistines: whithersoever he turned, he was victorious.
009	1SA	014	048	And he wrought valiantly, and smote Amalec, and rescued Israel out of the hand of them that trampled on him.
009	1SA	014	049	And the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Jessiu, and Melchisa: and [these were] the names of his two daughters, the name of the first-born Merob, and the name of the second Melchol.
009	1SA	014	050	And the name of his wife was Achinoom, the daughter of Achimaa: and the name of his captain of the host was Abenner, the son of Ner, son of a kinsman of Saul.
009	1SA	014	051	And Kis [was] the father of Saul, and Ner, the father of Abenezer, [was] son of Jamin, son of Abiel.
009	1SA	014	052	And the war was vehement against the Philistines all the days of Saul; and when Saul saw any mighty man, and any valiant man, then he took them to himself.
009	1SA	015	001	And Samuel said to Saul, The Lord sent me to anoint thee king over Israel: and now hear the voice of the Lord.
009	1SA	015	002	Thus said the Lord of hosts, Now will I take vengeance for what Amalec did to Israel, when he met him in the way as he came up out of Egypt.
009	1SA	015	003	And now go, and thou shalt smite Amalec and Hierim and all that belongs to him, and thou shalt not save anything of him alive, but thou shalt utterly destroy him: and thou shalt devote him and all his to [destruction], and thou shalt spare nothing belonging to him; and thou shalt slay both man and woman, and infant and suckling, and calf and sheep, and camel and ass.
009	1SA	015	004	And Saul summoned the people, and he numbered them in Galgala, four hundred thousand regular troops, and Juda thirty thousand regular troops.
009	1SA	015	005	And Saul came to the cities of Amalec, and laid wait in the valley.
009	1SA	015	006	And Saul said to the Kinite, Go, and depart out of the midst of the Amalekites, lest I put thee with them; for thou dealedst mercifully with the children of Israel when they went up out of Egypt. So the Kinite departed from the midst of Amalec.
009	1SA	015	007	And Saul smote Amalec from Evilat to Sur fronting Egypt.
009	1SA	015	008	And he took Agag the king of Amalec alive, and he slew all the people and Hierim with the edge of the sword.
009	1SA	015	009	And Saul and all the people saved Agag alive, and the best of the flocks, and of the herds, and of the fruits, of the vineyards, and of all the good things; and they would not destroy them: but every worthless and refuse thing they destroyed.
009	1SA	015	010	And the word of the Lord came to Samuel, saying,
009	1SA	015	011	I have repented that I have made Saul to be king: for he has turned back from following me, and has not kept my word. And Samuel was grieved, and cried to the Lord all night.
009	1SA	015	012	And Samuel rose early and went to meet Israel in the morning, and it was told Saul, saying, Samuel has come to Carmel, and he has raised up help for himself: and he turned his chariot, and came down to Galgala to Saul; and, behold, he was offering up a whole-burnt-offering to the Lord, the chief of the spoils which he brought out of Amalec.
009	1SA	015	013	And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said to him, Blessed [art] thou of the Lord: I have performed all that the Lord said.
009	1SA	015	014	And Samuel said, What then [is] the bleating of this flock in my ears, and the sound of the oxen which I hear?
009	1SA	015	015	And Saul said, I have brought them out of Amalec, that which the people preserved, even the best of the sheep, and of the cattle, that it might be sacrificed to the Lord thy God, and the rest have I utterly destroyed.
009	1SA	015	016	And Samuel said to Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the Lord has said to me this night: and he said to him, Say on.
009	1SA	015	017	And Samuel said to Saul, Art thou not little in his eyes, [though] a leader of one of the tribes of Israel? and [yet] the Lord anointed thee to be king over Israel.
009	1SA	015	018	And the Lord sent thee on a journey, and said to thee, Go, and utterly destroy: thou shalt slay the sinners against me, [even] the Amalekites; and thou shalt war against them until thou have consumed them.
009	1SA	015	019	And why didst not thou hearken to the voice of the Lord, but didst haste to fasten upon the spoils, and didst that which was evil in the sight of the Lord?
009	1SA	015	020	And Saul said to Samuel, Because I listened to the voice of the people: yet I went the way by which the Lord sent me, and I brought Agag the king of Amalec, and I destroyed Amalec.
009	1SA	015	021	But the people took of the spoils the best flocks and herds [out] of that which was destroyed, to sacrifice before the Lord our God in Galgal.
009	1SA	015	022	And Samuel said, Does the Lord take pleasure in whole-burnt-offerings and sacrifices, as in hearing the words of the Lord? behold, obedience [is] better than a good sacrifice, and hearkening than the fat of rams.
009	1SA	015	023	For sin is [as] divination; idols bring on pain and grief. Because thou hast rejected the word of the Lord, the Lord also shall reject thee from being king over Israel.
009	1SA	015	024	And Saul said to Samuel, I have sinned, in that I have transgressed the word of the Lord and thy direction; for I feared the people, and I hearkened to their voice.
009	1SA	015	025	And now remove, I pray thee, my sin, and turn back with me, and I will worship the Lord thy God.
009	1SA	015	026	And Samuel said to Saul, I will not turn back with thee, for thou hast rejected the word of the Lord, and the Lord will reject thee from being king over Israel.
009	1SA	015	027	And Samuel turned his face to depart, and Saul caught hold of the skirt of his garment, and tore it.
009	1SA	015	028	And Samuel said to him, The Lord has rent thy kingdom from Israel out of thy hand this day, and will give it to thy neighbour who is better than thou.
009	1SA	015	029	And Israel shall be divided to two: and [God] will not turn nor repent, for he is not as a man to repent.
009	1SA	015	030	And Saul said, I have sinned; yet honour me, I pray thee, before the elders of Israel, and before my people; and turn back with me, and I will worship the Lord thy God.
009	1SA	015	031	So Samuel turned back after Saul, and he worshipped the Lord.
009	1SA	015	032	And Samuel said, Bring me Agag the king of Amalec: and Agag came to him trembling; and Agag said Is death thus bitter?
009	1SA	015	033	And Samuel said to Agag, As thy sword has bereaved women of their children, so shall thy mother be made childless among women: and Samuel slew Agag before the Lord in Galgal.
009	1SA	015	034	And Samuel departed to Armathaim, and Saul went up to his house at Gabaa.
009	1SA	015	035	And Samuel did not see Saul again till the day of his death, for Samuel mourned after Saul, and the Lord repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.
009	1SA	016	001	And the Lord said to Samuel, How long dost thou mourn for Saul, whereas I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? Fill thy horn with oil, and come, I will send thee to Jessae, to Bethleem; for I have seen among his sons a king for me.
009	1SA	016	002	And Samuel said, How can I go? whereas Saul will hear of it, and slay me: and the Lord said, Take a heifer in thine hand and thou shall say, I am come to sacrifice to the Lord.
009	1SA	016	003	And thou shalt call Jessae to the sacrifice, and I will make known to thee what thou shalt do; and thou shalt anoint him whom I shall mention to thee.
009	1SA	016	004	And Samuel did all that the Lord told him; and he came to Bethleem: and the elders of the city were amazed at meeting him, and said, Dost thou come peaceably, thou Seer?
009	1SA	016	005	And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice to the Lord. Sanctify yourselves, and rejoice with me this day: and he sanctified Jessae and his sons, and he called them to the sacrifice.
009	1SA	016	006	And it came to pass when they came in, that he saw Eliab, and said, Surely the Lord's anointed [is] before him.
009	1SA	016	007	But the Lord said to Samuel, Look not on his appearance, nor on his stature, for I have rejected him; for God sees not as man looks; for man looks at the outward appearance, but God looks at the heart.
009	1SA	016	008	And Jessae called Aminadab, and he passed before Samuel: and he said, Neither has God chosen this one.
009	1SA	016	009	And Jessae caused Sama to pass by: and he said, Neither has God chosen this one.
009	1SA	016	010	And Jessae caused his seven sons to pass before Samuel: and Samuel said, the Lord has not chosen these.
009	1SA	016	011	And Samuel said to Jessae, Hast thou no more sons? And Jessae said, [There is] yet a little one; behold, he tends the flock. And Samuel said to Jessae, Send and fetch him for we may not sit down till he comes.
009	1SA	016	012	And he sent and fetched him: and he was ruddy, with beauty of eyes, and very goodly to behold. And the Lord said to Samuel, Arise, and anoint David, for he is good.
009	1SA	016	013	And Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the Lord came upon David from that day forward: and Samuel arose, and departed to Armathaim.
009	1SA	016	014	And the Spirit of the Lord departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the Lord tormented him.
009	1SA	016	015	And Saul's servants said to him, Behold now, and evil spirit from the Lord torments thee.
009	1SA	016	016	Let now thy servants speak before thee, and let them seek for our lord a man skilled to play on the harp; and it shall come to pass when an evil spirit comes upon thee and he shall play on his harp, that thou shalt be well, and he shall refresh thee.
009	1SA	016	017	And Saul said to his servants, Look now out for me a skilful player, and bring him to me.
009	1SA	016	018	And one of his servants answered and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jessae the Bethleemite, and he understands playing [on the harp], and the man [is] prudent, and a warrior, and wise in speech, and the man [is] handsome, and the Lord [is] with him.
009	1SA	016	019	And Saul sent messengers to Jessae, saying, Send to me thy son David who is with thy flock.
009	1SA	016	020	And Jessae took a homer of bread, and a bottle of wine, and one kid of the goats, and sent them by the hand of his son David to Saul.
009	1SA	016	021	And David went in to Saul, and stood before him; and he loved him greatly; and he became his armour-bearer.
009	1SA	016	022	And Saul sent to Jessae, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand before me, for he has found grace in my eyes.
009	1SA	016	023	And it came to pass when the evil spirit was upon Saul, that David took his harp, and played with his hand: and Saul was refreshed, and [it was] well with him, and the evil spirit departed from him.
009	1SA	017	001	And the Philistines gather their armies to battle, and gather themselves to Socchoth of Judaea, and encamp between Socchoth and Azeca Ephermen.
009	1SA	017	002	And Saul and the men of Israel gather together, and they encamp in the valley, and set the battle in array against the Philistines.
009	1SA	017	003	And the Philistines stand on the mountain on one side, and Israel stands on the mountain on the other side, and the valley was between them.
009	1SA	017	004	And there went forth a mighty man out of the army of the Philistines, Goliath, by name, out of Geth, his height [was] four cubits and a span.
009	1SA	017	005	And [he had] a helmet upon his head, and he wore a breastplate of chain armour; and the weight of his breastplate [was] five thousand shekels of brass and iron.
009	1SA	017	006	And greaves of grass [were] upon his legs, and a brazen target [was] between his shoulders.
009	1SA	017	007	And the staff of his spear [was] like a weaver's beam, and the spear's head [was formed] of six hundred shekels of iron; and his armour-bearer went before him.
009	1SA	017	008	And he stood and cried to the army of Israel, and said to them, Why are ye come forth to set yourselves in battle array against us? Am not I a Philistine, and ye Hebrews of Saul? Choose for yourselves a man, and let him come down to me.
009	1SA	017	009	And if he shall be able to fight against me, and shall smite me, then will we be your servants: but if I should prevail and smite him, ye shall be our servants, and serve us.
009	1SA	017	010	And the Philistine said, Behold, I have defied the armies of Israel this very day: give me a man, and we will both of us fight in single combat.
009	1SA	017	011	And Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine, and they were dismayed, and greatly terrified.
009	1SA	017	012	[And David son of an Ephrathite said, this Eplarathite was of Bethleem Juda, and his name was Jessae, and he had eight sons. And the man passed for an old man among men in the days of Saul.]
009	1SA	017	013	[And the three elder sons of Jessae went and followed Saul to the war, and the] [names of his sons that went to the war were, Eliab his ﬁrst-born, and his second Aminadab, and his third son Samma.]
009	1SA	017	014	[And David himself] [was the younger son, and the three elder followed Saul.]
009	1SA	017	015	[And David departed and returned from Saul,] [to feed his father’s sheep in Bethleem;]
009	1SA	017	016	[And the Philistine advanced morning and evening, and stood up forty days.]
009	1SA	017	017	[And Jessae said to David, Take now to thy brethren an ephah of this meal, and these ten loaves, and run to the camp and give them to thy brothers.]
009	1SA	017	018	[And thou shalt carry to the captain of the thousand] [these ten cheeses of milk, and thou shalt see how thy brethren fare, and learn what they want.]
009	1SA	017	019	[And Saul himself and all the men of Israel were in the valley of the Oak, warring with the Philistines.]
009	1SA	017	020	[And David rose early in the morning, and left the sheep to a keeper, and took and went as Jessae commanded him, and he came to the trench and to the army as it was going out to ﬁght, and they shouted for the battle.]
009	1SA	017	021	[And Israel and the Philistines formed their lines one opposite the other.]
009	1SA	017	022	[And David deposited his burden in the hand of a keeper, and ran to the line, and went and asked his brethren how they Were.]
009	1SA	017	023	[And while he was speaking with them, behold the Amessaean advanced, Goliath by name, the Philistine of Geth, of the armies of the Philistines, and he spoke] [as before, and David heard.]
009	1SA	017	024	[And all the men of Israel when they saw the man ﬂed from before him, and they were greatly terrified.]
009	1SA	017	025	[And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that comes up? for he has reproached Israel and has come up; and it shall be that the man who shall smite him, the king shall enrich him with great wealth and shall give him his daughter, and shall make his father’s house free in Israel.]
009	1SA	017	026	[and David spoke to the men who stood with him saying, Shall it indeed be done thus to the man who shall smite that Philistine, and take away reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he has defied the army of the living God?]
009	1SA	017	027	[And the people spoke to him according to this Word, saying Thus shall it be done to the man Who shall smite him.]
009	1SA	017	028	[And Eliab his elder brother heard as he spoke to the men, and Eliab was very angry with David and said, Why hast thou thus come down, and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride and the naughtiness of thine heart, for thou art come down to see the battle.]
009	1SA	017	029	[And David said what have I done now?] [Have I no business here?]
009	1SA	017	030	[And he turned from him towards another, and he spoke after the same manner; and the people answered him] [after the former manner.]
009	1SA	017	031	[And the Words which David spoke were heard and were reported] [to Saul. And he took him to himself.]
009	1SA	017	032	And David said to Saul, Let not, I pray thee, the heart of my lord be dejected within him: thy servant will go, and fight with this Philistine.
009	1SA	017	033	And Saul said to David, Thou wilt not in anywise be able to go against this Philistine to fight with him, for thou art a mere youth, and he a man of war from his youth.
009	1SA	017	034	And David said to Saul, Thy servant was tending the flock for his father; and when a lion came and a she-bear, and took a sheep out of the flock,
009	1SA	017	035	then I went forth after him, and smote him, and drew [the spoil] out of his mouth: and as he rose up against me, then I caught hold of his throat, and smote him, and slew him.
009	1SA	017	036	Thy servant smote both the lion and the bear, and the uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them: shall I not go and smite him, and remove this day a reproach from Israel? For who [is] this uncircumcised one, who has defied the army of the living God?
009	1SA	017	037	The Lord who delivered me out of the paw of the lion and out the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this uncircumcised Philistine. And Saul said to David, Go, and the Lord shall be with thee.
009	1SA	017	038	And Saul clothed David with a military coat, and [put] his brazen helmet on his head.
009	1SA	017	039	And he girt David with his sword over his coat: and he made trial walking [with them] once and again: and David said to Saul, I shall not be able to go with these, for I have not proved [them]: so they remove them from him.
009	1SA	017	040	And he took his staff in his hand, and he chose for himself five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in the shepherd's scrip which he had for his store, and his sling was in his hand; and he approached the Philistine.
009	1SA	017	041	And the Philistine advanced and drew nigh to David, and a man bearing his shield went before him, and the Philistine looked on.
009	1SA	017	042	And Goliath saw David, and despised him; for he was a lad, and ruddy, with a fair countenance.
009	1SA	017	043	And the Philistine said to David, Am I as a dog, that thou comest against me with a staff and stones? [and David said, Nay, but worse than a dog.] And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.
009	1SA	017	044	And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy flesh to the birds of the air, and to the beasts of the earth.
009	1SA	017	045	And David said to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with sword, and with spear, and with shield; but I come to thee in the name of the Lord God of hosts of the army of Israel, which thou hast defied
009	1SA	017	046	this day. And the Lord shall deliver thee this day into my hand; and I will slay thee, and take away thy head from off thee, and will give thy limbs and the limbs of the army of the Philistines this day to the birds of the sky, and to the wild beasts of the earth; and all the earth shall know that there is a God in Israel.
009	1SA	017	047	And all this assembly shall know that the Lord delivers not by sword or spear, for the battle [is] the Lord's, and the Lord will deliver you into our hands.
009	1SA	017	048	And the Philistine arose and went to meet David.
009	1SA	017	049	And David stretched out his hand to his scrip, and took thence a stone, and slang it, and smote the Philistine on his forehead, and the stone penetrated through the helmet into his forehead, and he fell upon his face to the ground.
009	1SA	017	050	[So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and a stone, and smote the Philistine and slew him, and there was no sword in the hand of David.]
009	1SA	017	051	And David ran, and stood upon him, and took his sword, and slew him, and cut off his head: and the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, and they fled.
009	1SA	017	052	And the men of Israel and Juda arose, and shouted and pursued them as far as the entrance to Geth, and as far as the gate of Ascalon: and the slain men of the Philistines fell in the way of the gates, both to Geth, and to Accaron.
009	1SA	017	053	And the men of Israel returned from pursuing after the Philistines, and they destroyed their camp.
009	1SA	017	054	And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armour in his tent.
009	1SA	017	055	And when Saul saw David going out to meet the Philistine, he said to Abener the captain of the host, Whose son is this youth? and Abener said, As thy sould lives, O King, I know not.
009	1SA	017	056	And the king said, Do thou ask whose son this youth is.
009	1SA	017	057	And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abener took him and brought him before Saul, and the head of the Philistine was in his hand.
009	1SA	017	058	And Saul said to him, Whose son art thou, young man? and David said, The son of thy servant Jessae the Bethleemite.
009	1SA	018	001	[And it came to pass when he had finished speaking to Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit to the soul of David and David loved him] [as his own soul.]
009	1SA	018	002	[And Saul took him in that day, and did not suffer him to return to his father's house.]
009	1SA	018	003	[And Jonathan and David made a covenant because he loved him as his own soul.]
009	1SA	018	004	[And Jonathan stripped himself of his] [upper garment, and gave it to David, and his mantle and all he had upon him, even to his sword and to his bow, and to his girdle.]
009	1SA	018	005	[And David went out withersoever Saul sent him, and] [acted wisely, and Saul set him over the men of war, and he was pleasing in the eyes of all the people, and also in the eyes of the servants of Saul.]
009	1SA	018	006	And there came out women in dances to meet David out of all the cities of Israel, with timbrels, and with rejoicing, and with cymbals.
009	1SA	018	007	And the women began [the strain], and said, Saul has smitten his thousands, and David his ten thousands.
009	1SA	018	008	And it seemed evil in the eyes of Saul concerning this matter, and he said, To David they have given ten thousands, and to me they have given thousands. [And what more can he have but the kingdom?]
009	1SA	018	009	[And Saul eyed David from that day and onward.]
009	1SA	018	010	[And it came to pass] [on the morrow that an evil spirit from God fell upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of his house. And David was playing on the harp with his hand, according to his daily custom. And Saul’s spear was in his hand.]
009	1SA	018	011	[And Saul took his spear and said, I will smite David even to the wall. But David escaped twice from his presence.]
009	1SA	018	012	And Saul was alarmed on account of David.
009	1SA	018	013	And he removed him from him, and made him a captain of a thousand for himself; and he went out and came in before the people.
009	1SA	018	014	And David was prudent in all his ways, and the Lord was with him.
009	1SA	018	015	And Saul saw that he was very wise, and he was afraid of him.
009	1SA	018	016	And all Israel and Juda loved David, because he came in and went out before the people.
009	1SA	018	017	[And Saul said to David, Behold my elder daughter Merob, I will give her to thee to Wife, only be thou to me a mighty man and ﬁght the wars of the Lord. And Saul said, Let not my hand be upon him, but the hand of the Philistines shall be upon him.]
009	1SA	018	018	[And David said to Saul, Who am I, and What is the life of my father’s family in Israel, that I should be the king’s son—in-law?]
009	1SA	018	019	[But it came to pass at the time when Merob Saul’s daughter should have been given to David, that she was given to Israel the Mothulathite to wife.]
009	1SA	018	020	And Melchol the daughter of Saul loved David; and it was told Saul, and the thing was pleasing in his eyes.
009	1SA	018	021	And Saul said, I will give her to him, and she shall be a stumbling-block to him. Now the hand of the Philistines was against Saul.
009	1SA	018	022	And Saul charged his servants, saying, Speak ye privately to David, saying, Behold, the king delights in thee, and all his servants love thee, and do thou becomes the king's son-in-law.
009	1SA	018	023	And the servants of Saul spoke these words in the ears of David; and David said, [Is it] a light thing in your eyes to become son-in-law to the king? Whereas I [am] an humble man, an not honourable?
009	1SA	018	024	And the servants of Saul reported to him according to these words, which David spoke.
009	1SA	018	025	And Saul said, Thus shall ye speak to David, The king wants no gift but a hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to avenge himself on the kings enemies. Now Saul thought to cast him into the hands of the Philistines.
009	1SA	018	026	And the servants of Saul report these words to David, and David was well pleased to become the son-in-law to the king.
009	1SA	018	027	And David arose, and went, he and his men, and smote among the Philistines a hundred men: and he brought their foreskins, and he becomes the king's son-in-law, and [Saul] gives him Melchol his daughter to wife.
009	1SA	018	028	And Saul saw that the Lord [was] with David, and [that] all Israel loved him.
009	1SA	018	029	And he was yet more afraid of David.
009	1SA	018	030	[And the chief of the Philistines went forth; and it came to pass that from] [the suficiency of their expedition David acted Wisely above all the servants of Saul; and his name was honoured exceedingly.]
009	1SA	019	001	And Saul spoke to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, to slay David.
009	1SA	019	002	And Jonathan, Saul's son, loved David much: and Jonathan told David, saying, Saul seeks to kill thee: take heed to thyself therefore to-morrow morning, and hide thyself, and dwell in secret.
009	1SA	019	003	And I will go forth, and stand near my father in the field where thou shalt be, and I will speak concerning thee to my father; and I will see what his answer may be, and I will tell thee.
009	1SA	019	004	And Jonathan spoke favorably concerning David to Saul his father, and said to him, Let not the king sin against thy servant David, for he has not sinned against thee, and his deeds [are] very good.
009	1SA	019	005	And he put his life in his hand, and smote the Philistine, and the Lord wrought a great deliverance; and all Israel saw, and rejoined: why then dost thou sin against innocent blood, to slay David without a cause?
009	1SA	019	006	And Saul hearkened to the voice of Jonathan; and Saul swore, saying, [As] the Lord lives, he shall not die.
009	1SA	019	007	And Jonathan called David, and told him all these words; and Jonathan brought David in to Saul, and he was before him as in former times.
009	1SA	019	008	And there was again war against Saul; and David did valiantly, and fought against the Philistines, and smote them with a very great slaughter, and they fled from before him.
009	1SA	019	009	And an evil spirit from God was upon Saul, and he was resting in his house, and a spear [was] in his hand, and David was playing on the harp with his hands.
009	1SA	019	010	And Saul sought to smite David with the spear; and David withdrew [suddenly] from the presence of Saul; and he drove the spear into the wall; and David retreated and escaped.
009	1SA	019	011	And it came to pass in that night, that Saul sent messengers to the house of David to watch him, in order to slay him in the morning; and Melchol David's wife told him, saying, Unless thou save thy life this night, to-morrow thou shalt be slain.
009	1SA	019	012	So Melchol lets David down by the window, and he departed, and fled, and escaped.
009	1SA	019	013	And Melchol took images, and laid them on the bed, and she put the liver of a goat by his head, and covered them with clothes.
009	1SA	019	014	And Saul sent messengers to take David; and they say that he is sick.
009	1SA	019	015	And he sends to David, saying, Bring him to me on the bed, that I may slay him.
009	1SA	019	016	And the messengers come, and, behold, the images [were] on the bed, and the goat's liver at his head.
009	1SA	019	017	And Saul said to Melchol, Why hast thou thus deceived me, and suffered my enemy to depart, and he has escaped? and Melchol said to Saul, He said, let me go, and if not, I will slay thee.
009	1SA	019	018	So David fled, and escaped, and comes to Samuel to Armathaim, and tells him all that Saul had done to him: and Samuel and David went, and dwelt in Navath in Rama.
009	1SA	019	019	And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David [is] in Navath in Rama.
009	1SA	019	020	And Saul sent messengers to take David, and they saw the assembly of the prophets, and Samuel stood [as] appointed over them; and the Spirit of God came upon the messengers of Saul, and they prophesy.
009	1SA	019	021	And it was told Saul, and he sent other messengers, and they also prophesied: and Saul sent again a third set of messengers, and they also prophesied.
009	1SA	019	022	And Saul was very angry, and went himself also to Armathaim, and he comes as far as the well of the threshing floor that is in Sephi; and he asked and said, Where [are] Samuel and David? And they said, Behold, in Navath in Rama.
009	1SA	019	023	And he went thence to Navath in Rama: and there came the Spirit of God upon him also, and he went on prophesying till he came to Navath in Rama.
009	1SA	019	024	And he took off his clothes, and prophesied before them; and lay down naked all that day and all that night: therefore they said, [Is] Saul also among the prophets?
009	1SA	020	001	And David fled from Navath in Rama, and comes into the presence of Jonathan; and he said, What have I done, and what [is] my fault, and wherein have I sinned before thy father, that he seeks my life?
009	1SA	020	002	And Jonathan said to him, Far be it from thee: thou shalt not die: behold, my father will not do any thing great or small without discovering it to me; and why should my father hide this matter from me? This thing is not [so].
009	1SA	020	003	And David answered Jonathan, and said, Thy father knows surely that I have found grace in thy sight, and he said, Let not Jonathan know this, lest he refuse his consent: but [as] the Lord lives and thy soul lives, as I said, [the space] is filled up between me and death.
009	1SA	020	004	And Jonathan said to David, What does thy soul desire, and what shall I do for thee.
009	1SA	020	005	And David said to Jonathan, Behold, to-morrow [is] the new moon, and I shall not on any account sit down to eat, but thou shalt let me go, and I will hide in the plain till the evening.
009	1SA	020	006	And if thy father do in anywise enquire for me, then shalt thou say, David earnestly asked leave of me to run to Bethleem his city, for [there is] there, a yearly sacrifice for all the family.
009	1SA	020	007	If he shall say thus, Well, — [all is] safe for thy servant: but if he shall answer harshly to thee, know that evil is determined by him.
009	1SA	020	008	And thou shalt deal mercifully with thy servant; for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the Lord with thyself: and if there is iniquity in thy servant, slay me thyself; but why dost thou thus bring me to thy father?
009	1SA	020	009	And Jonathan said, That be far from thee: for if I surely know that evil is determined by my father to come upon thee, although it should not be against thy cities, I will tell thee.
009	1SA	020	010	And David said to Jonathan, Who can tell me if thy father should answer roughly?
009	1SA	020	011	And Jonathan said to David, Go, and abide in the field. And they went out both into the field.
009	1SA	020	012	And Jonathan said to David, the Lord God of Israel knows that I will sound my father as I have an opportunity, three several times, and, behold, [if good] should be determined concerning David, and I do not send to thee to the field,
009	1SA	020	013	God do so to Jonathan and more also: as I shall [also] report the evil to thee, and make it known to thee, and I will let thee go; and thou shalt depart in peace, and the Lord shall be with thee, as he was with my father.
009	1SA	020	014	And if indeed I continue to live, then shalt thou deal mercifully with me; and if I indeed die,
009	1SA	020	015	thou shalt not withdraw thy mercy from my house for ever: and if thou doest not, when the Lord cuts off the enemies of David each from the face of the earth,
009	1SA	020	016	[should it happen] that the name of Jonathan be discovered by the house of David, then let the Lord seek out the enemies of David.
009	1SA	020	017	And Jonathan swore yet again to David, because he loved the soul of him that loved him.
009	1SA	020	018	And Jonathan said, To-morrow [is] the new moon, and thou wilt be enquired for, because thy seat will be observed as vacant.
009	1SA	020	019	And thou shalt stay three days, and watch an opportunity, and shalt come to thy place where thou mayest hide thyself in the day of thy business, and thou shalt wait by that ergab.
009	1SA	020	020	And I will shoot three arrows, aiming them at a mark.
009	1SA	020	021	And behold, I [will] send a lad, saying, Go find me the arrow.
009	1SA	020	022	If I should expressly say to the lad, The arrow [is] here, and on this side of thee, take it; [then] come, for it is well with thee, and there is no reason [for fear, as] the Lord lives: [but] if I should say thus to the young man, The arrow [is] on that side of thee, and beyond; go, for the Lord hath sent thee away.
009	1SA	020	023	And as for the word which thou and I have spoken, behold, the Lord [is] witness between me and thee for ever.
009	1SA	020	024	So David hides himself in the field, and the [new] month arrives, and the king comes to the table to eat.
009	1SA	020	025	And he sat upon his seat as in former times, even on his seat by the wall, and he went before Jonathan; and Abenner sat on one side of Saul, and the place of David was empty.
009	1SA	020	026	And Saul said nothing on that day, for he said, It seems to have fallen out that he is not clean, because he has not purified himself.
009	1SA	020	027	And it came to pass on the morrow, on the second day of the month, that the place of David was empty; and Saul said to Jonathan his son, Why has not the son of Jessae attended both yesterday and today at the table?
009	1SA	020	028	And Jonathan answered Saul, and said to him, David asked leave of me to go as far as Bethleem his city;
009	1SA	020	029	and he said, Let me go, I pray thee, for we have a family sacrifice in the city, and my brethren have sent for me; and now, if I have found grace in thine eyes, I will even go over and see my brethren: therefore he is not present at the table of the king.
009	1SA	020	030	And Saul was exceedingly angry with Jonathan, and said to him, Thou son of traitorous damsels! for do I not know that thou art an accomplice with the son of Jessae to thy same, and to the shame of thy mother's nakedness?
009	1SA	020	031	For so long as the son of Jessae lives upon the earth, thy kingdom shall not be established: now then send and take the young man, for he shall surely die.
009	1SA	020	032	And Jonathan answered Saul, Why is he to die? What has he done?
009	1SA	020	033	And Saul lifted up his spear against Jonathan to slay him: so Jonathan knew that this evil was determined on by his father to slay David.
009	1SA	020	034	And Jonathan sprang up from the table in great anger, and did not eat bread on the second [day] of the month, for he grieved bitterly for David, because his father determined [on mischief] against him.
009	1SA	020	035	And morning came, and Jonathan went out to the field, as he appointed [to do] for a signal to David, and a little boy [was] with him.
009	1SA	020	036	And he said to the boy, Run, find me the arrows which I shoot: and the boy ran, and [Jonathan] shot an arrow, and sent it beyond [him].
009	1SA	020	037	And the boy came to the place where the arrow was which Jonathan shot; and Jonathan cried out after the lad, and said, The arrow [is] on that side of thee and beyond thee.
009	1SA	020	038	And Jonathan cried out after his boy, saying, Make all speed, and stay not. And Jonathan's boy gathered up the arrows, and brought the arrows to his master.
009	1SA	020	039	And the boy knew nothing, only Jonathan and David [knew].
009	1SA	020	040	And Jonathan gave his weapons to his boy, and said to his boy, Go, enter into the city.
009	1SA	020	041	And when the lad went in, then David arose from the argab, and fell upon his face, and did obeisance to him three times, and they kissed each other, and wept for each other, for a great while.
009	1SA	020	042	And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, and as we have both sworn in the name of the Lord, saying, The Lord shall be witness between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for ever—[even so let it be]. And David arose and departed, and Jonathan went into the city.
009	1SA	021	001	And David comes to Nomba to Abimelech the priest: and Abimelech was amazed at meeting him, and said to him, Why [art] thou alone, and nobody with thee?
009	1SA	021	002	And David said to the priest, The king gave me a command to-day, and said to me, Let no one know the matter on which I send thee, an concerning which I have charged thee: and I have charged my servants [to be] in the place that is called, The faithfulness of God, phellani maemoni.
009	1SA	021	003	And now if there are under thy hand five loaves, give into my hand what is ready.
009	1SA	021	004	And the priest answered David, and said, There are no common loaves under my hand, for I have none but holy loaves: if the young men have been kept at least from women, then they shall eat [them].
009	1SA	021	005	And David answered the priest, and said to him, Yea, we have been kept from women for three days: when I came forth for the journey all the young men were purified; but this expedition is unclean, wherefore it shall be sanctified this day because of my weapons.
009	1SA	021	006	So Abimelech the priest gave him the shewbread; for there were no loaves there, but only the presence loaves which had been removed from the presence of the Lord, in order that hot bread should be set on, on the day on which he took them.
009	1SA	021	007	And there was there on that day one of Saul's servants detained before the Lord, and his name [was] Doec the Syrian, tending the mules of Saul.
009	1SA	021	008	And David said to Abimelech, See if there is here under thy hand spear or sword, for I have not brought in my hand my sword or my weapons, for the word of the king was urgent.
009	1SA	021	009	And the priest said, Behold the sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou smotest in the valley of Ela; and it is wrapt in a cloth: if thou wilt take it, take it for thyself, for there is no other except it here. And David said, Behold, there is none like it; give it me.
009	1SA	021	010	And he gave it him; and David arose, and fled in that day from he presence of Saul: and David came to Anchus king of Geth.
009	1SA	021	011	And the servants of Anchus said to him, [Is] not this David the king of the land? Did not the dancing women begin the son to him, saying, Saul has smitten his thousand, and David his ten thousands?
009	1SA	021	012	And David laid up the words in his heart, and was greatly afraid of Anchus king of Geth.
009	1SA	021	013	And he changed his appearance before him, and feigned himself a false character in that day; and drummed upon the doors of the city, and used extravagant gestures with his hands, and fell against the doors of the gate, and his spittle ran down upon his beard.
009	1SA	021	014	And Anchus said to his servants, Lo! ye see the man [is] mad: why have ye brought him in to me?
009	1SA	021	015	[Am] I in want of madmen, that ye have brought him in to me to play the madman? He shall not come into the house.
009	1SA	022	001	And David departed thence, and escaped; and he comes to the cave of Odollam, and his brethren hear, and the house of his father, and they go down to him there.
009	1SA	022	002	And there gathered to him every one that was in distress, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was troubled in mind; and he was a leader over them, and there were with him about four hundred men.
009	1SA	022	003	And David departed thence to Massephath of Moab, and said to the king of Moab, Let, I pray thee, my father and my mother be with thee, until I know what God will do to me.
009	1SA	022	004	And he persuaded the King of Moab, and they dwell with him continually, while David was in the hold.
009	1SA	022	005	And Gad the prophet said to David, Dwell not in the hold: go, and thou shalt enter the land of Juda. So David went, and came and dwelt in the city of Saric.
009	1SA	022	006	And Saul heard that David was discovered, and his men with him: now Saul dwelt in the hill below the field that is in Rama, and his spear [was] in his hand, and all his servants stood near him.
009	1SA	022	007	And Saul said to his servants that stood by him, Hear now, ye sons of Benjamin, will the son of Jessae indeed give all of you fields and vineyards, and will he make you all captains of hundreds and captains of thousands?
009	1SA	022	008	That ye are conspiring against me, and there is no one that informs me, whereas my son has made a covenant with the son of Jessae, and there is no one of you that is sorry for me, or informs me, that my son has stirred up my servant against me for an enemy, as [it is] this day?
009	1SA	022	009	And Doec the Syrian who was over the mules of Saul answered and said, I saw the son of Jessae as he came to Nomba to Abimelech son of Achitob the priest.
009	1SA	022	010	And [the priest] enquired of God for him, and gave him provision, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.
009	1SA	022	011	And the king sent to call Abimelech son of Achitob and all his father's sons, the priests that were in Nomba; and they all came to the king.
009	1SA	022	012	And Saul said, Hear now, thou son of Achitob. And he said, Lo! I [am here], speak, [my] lord.
009	1SA	022	013	And Saul said to him, Why have thou and the son of Jessae conspired against me, that thou shouldest give him bread and a sword, and shouldest enquire of God for him, to raise him up against me as an enemy, as [he is] this day?
009	1SA	022	014	And he answered the king, and said, And who [is] there among all thy servants faithful as David, and [he is] a son-in-law of the king, and [he is] executor of all thy commands, and [is] honourable in thy house?
009	1SA	022	015	Have I begun to-day to enquire of God for him? By no means: let not the king bring a charge against his servant, and against thee whole of my father's house; for thy servant knew not in all these matters anything great or small.
009	1SA	022	016	And king Saul said, Thou shalt surely die, Abimelech, thou, and all thy father's house.
009	1SA	022	017	And the king said to the footmen that attended on him, Draw nigh and slay the priests of the Lord, because their hand [is] with David, and because they knew that he fled, and they did not inform me. But the servants of the king would not lift their hands to fall upon the priest of the Lord.
009	1SA	022	018	And the king said to Doec, Turn thou, and fall upon the priests: and Doec the Syrian turned, and slew the priests of the Lord in that day, three hundred and five men, all wearing an ephod.
009	1SA	022	019	And he smote Nomba the city of the priest with the edge of the sword, both man, and woman, infant and suckling, and calf, and ox, and sheep.
009	1SA	022	020	And one son of Abimelech son of Achitob escapes, and his name [was] Abiathar, and he fled after David.
009	1SA	022	021	And Abiathar told David that Saul had slain all the priests of the Lord.
009	1SA	022	022	And David said to Abiathar, I knew it in that day, that Doec the Syrian would surely tell Saul: I am guilty of the death of the house of thy father.
009	1SA	022	023	Dwell with me; fear not, for wherever I shall seek a place [of safety] for my life, I will also seek a place for thy life, for thou art safely guarded [while] with me.
009	1SA	023	001	And it was told David, saying, behold, the Philistines war in Keila, and they rob, they trample on the threshing-floors.
009	1SA	023	002	And David enquired of the Lord, saying, Shall I go and smite these Philistines? And the Lord said, Go, and thou shalt smite these Philistines, and shalt save Keila.
009	1SA	023	003	And the men of David said to him, Behold, we are afraid here in Judea; and how shall it be if we go to Keila? Shall we go after the spoils of the Philistines?
009	1SA	023	004	And David enquired yet again of the Lord; and the Lord answered him, and said to him, Arise and go down to Keila, for I will deliver the Philistines into thy hands.
009	1SA	023	005	So David and his men with him went to Keila, and fought with the Philistines; and they fled from before him, and he carried off their cattle, and smote them with a great slaughter, and David rescued the inhabitants of Keila.
009	1SA	023	006	And it came to pass when Abiathar the son of Achimelech fled to David, that he went down with David to Keila, having and ephod in his hand.
009	1SA	023	007	And it was told Saul that David was come to Keila: and Saul said, God has sold him into my hands, for he is shut up, having entered into a city that has gates and bars.
009	1SA	023	008	And Saul charged all the people to go down to war to Keila, to besiege David and his men.
009	1SA	023	009	And David knew that Saul spoke openly of mischief against him: and David said to Abiathar the priest, Bring the ephod of the Lord.
009	1SA	023	010	And David said, Lord God of Israel, thy servant has indeed heard, that Saul seeks to come against Keila to destroy the city on my account.
009	1SA	023	011	Will [the place] be shut up? And now will Saul come down, as thy servant has heard? Lord God of Israel, tell thy servant.
009	1SA	023	012	And the Lord said, It will be shut up.
009	1SA	023	013	And David arose, and the men with him, in number about four hundred, and they went forth from Keila, and went whithersoever they could go: and it was told Saul that David had escaped from Keila, and he forbore to come.
009	1SA	023	014	And he dwelt in Maserem in the wilderness, in the narrow [passes]; and dwelt in the wilderness in mount Ziph, in the dry country. And Saul sought him continually, but the Lord delivered him not into his hands.
009	1SA	023	015	And David perceived that Saul went forth to seek David; and David was in the dry mountain in the New Ziph.
009	1SA	023	016	And Jonathan son of Saul rose, and went to David to Caene, and strengthened his hands in the Lord.
009	1SA	023	017	And he said to him, Fear not, for the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee; and thou shalt be king over Israel, and I shall be second to thee; and Saul my father knows it.
009	1SA	023	018	So they both made a covenant before the Lord; and David dwelt in Caene, and Jonathan went to his home.
009	1SA	023	019	And the Ziphites came up out of the dry country to Saul to the hill, saying, Behold, is not David hidden with us in Messara, in the narrows in Caene in the hill of Echela, which is on the right of Jessaemon?
009	1SA	023	020	And now [according to] all the king's desire to come down, let him come down to us; they have shut him up into the hands of the king.
009	1SA	023	021	And Saul said to them, Blessed [be] ye of the Lord, for ye have been grieved on my account.
009	1SA	023	022	Go, I pray you, and make preparations yet, and notice his place where his foot shall be, quickly, in that place which ye spoke of, lest by any means he should deal craftily.
009	1SA	023	023	Take notice, then, and learn, and I will go with you; and it shall come to pass that if he is in the land, I will search him out among all the thousands of Juda.
009	1SA	023	024	And the Ziphites arose, and went before Saul: and David and his men [were] in the wilderness of Maon, westward, to the right of Jessaemon.
009	1SA	023	025	And Saul and his men went to seek him: and they brought word to David, and he went down to the rock that was in the wilderness of Maon: and Saul heard, and followed after David to the wilderness of Maon.
009	1SA	023	026	And Saul and his men go on one side of the mountain, and David and his men are on the other side of the mountain: and David was hiding himself to escape from Saul: and Saul and his men encamped against David and his men, in order to take them.
009	1SA	023	027	And there came a messenger to Saul, saying, Haste thee, and come hither, for the Philistines have invaded the land.
009	1SA	023	028	So Saul returned from following after David, and went to meet the Philistines: therefore that place was called The divided Rock.
009	1SA	023	029	And David rose up from thence, and dwelt in the narrow passes of Engaddi.
009	1SA	024	001	And it came to pass when Saul returned from pursuing after the Philistines, that it was reported to him, saying, David [is] in the wilderness of Engaddi.
009	1SA	024	002	And he took with him three thousand men, chosen out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men in front of Saddaeem.
009	1SA	024	003	And he came to the flocks of sheep that were by the way, and there was a cave there; and Saul went in to make preparation, and David and his men were sitting in the inner part of the cave.
009	1SA	024	004	And the men of David said to him, Behold, this [is] the day of which the Lord spoke to thee, that he would deliver thine enemy into thy hands; and thou shalt do to him as [it is] good in thy sight. So David arose and cut off the skirt of Saul's garment secretly.
009	1SA	024	005	And it came to pass after this that David's heart smote him, because he had cut off the skirt of his garment.
009	1SA	024	006	And David said to his men, The Lord forbid it me, that I should do this ting to my lord the anointed of the Lord, to lift my hand against him; for he is the anointed of the Lord.
009	1SA	024	007	So David persuaded his men by [his] words, and did not suffer them to arise and slay Saul: and Saul arose and went his way.
009	1SA	024	008	And David rose up [and went] after him out of the cave: and David cried after Saul, saying, [My] lord, [O] king! and Saul looked behind him, and David bowed with his face to the ground, and did obeisance to him.
009	1SA	024	009	And David said to Saul, Why dost thou hearken to the words of the people, saying, Behold, David seeks thy life?
009	1SA	024	010	Behold, thine eyes have seen this day how that the Lord has delivered thee this day into my hands in the cave; and I would not slay thee, but spared thee, and said, I will not lift up my hand against my lord, for he is the Lord's anointed.
009	1SA	024	011	And behold, the skirt of thy mantle [is] in my hand, I cut off the skirt, and did not slay thee: know then and see to-day, there is no evil in my hand, nor impiety, nor rebellion; and I have not sinned against thee, yet thou layest snares for my soul to take it.
009	1SA	024	012	The Lord judge between me and thee, and the Lord requite thee on thyself: but my hand shall not be upon thee.
009	1SA	024	013	As the old proverb says, Transgression will proceed from the wicked ones: but my hand shall not be upon thee.
009	1SA	024	014	And now after whom dost thou come forth, O king of Israel? After whom dost thou pursue? After a dead dog, and after a flea?
009	1SA	024	015	The Lord be judge and umpire between me and thee, the Lord look upon and judge my cause, and rescue me out of thy hand.
009	1SA	024	016	And it came to pass when David had finished speaking these words to Saul, that Saul said, [Is] this thy voice, Son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.
009	1SA	024	017	And Saul said to David, Thou [art] more righteous that I, for thou hast recompensed me good, but I have recompensed thee evil.
009	1SA	024	018	And thou hast told me to-day what good thou hast done me, how the Lord shut me up into thy hands to-day, and thou didst not slay me.
009	1SA	024	019	And if any one should find his enemy in distress, and should send him forth in a good way, then the Lord will reward him good, as thou has done this day.
009	1SA	024	020	And now, behold, I know that thou shalt surely reign, and the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thy hand.
009	1SA	024	021	Now then swear to me by the Lord, that thou wilt not destroy my seed after me, that thou wilt not blot out my name from the house of my father.
009	1SA	024	022	So David swore to Saul: and Saul departed to his place, and David and his men went up to the strong-hold of Messera.
009	1SA	025	001	And Samuel died, and all Israel assembled, and bewailed him, and they bury him in his house in Armathaim: and David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Maon.
009	1SA	025	002	And there was a man in Maon, and his flocks were in Carmel, and [he was] a very great man; and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand she-goats: and he happened to be shearing his flock in Carmel.
009	1SA	025	003	And the man's name [was] Nabal, and his wife's name [was] Abigaia: and his wife [was] of good understanding and very beautiful in person: but the man [was] harsh, and evil in his doings, and the man [was] churlish.
009	1SA	025	004	And David heard in the wilderness, that Nabal the Carmelite was shearing his sheep.
009	1SA	025	005	And David sent ten young men, and he said to the young men, Go up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and ask him in my name how he is.
009	1SA	025	006	And thus shall ye say, May thou and thy house seasonably prosper, and all thine be in prosperity.
009	1SA	025	007	And now, behold, I have heard that thy shepherds who were with is in the wilderness are shearing thy sheep, and we hindered them not, neither did we demand any thing from them all the time they were in Carmel.
009	1SA	025	008	Ask thy servants, and they will tell thee. Let then thy servants find grace in thine eyes, for we are come on a good day; give we pray thee, whatsoever thy hand may find, to thy son David.
009	1SA	025	009	So the servants come and speak these words to Nabal, according to all these words in the name of David.
009	1SA	025	010	And Nabal sprang up, and answered the servants of David, and said, Who [is] David? and who [is] the son of Jessae? Now-a-days there is abundance of servants who depart every one from his master.
009	1SA	025	011	And shall I take my bread, and my wine, and my beasts that I have slain for my shearers, and shall I give them to men of whom I know not whence they are?
009	1SA	025	012	So the servants of David turned back, and returned, and came and reported to David according to these words.
009	1SA	025	013	And David said to his men, Gird on every man his sword. And they went up after David, about four hundred men: and two hundred abode with the stuff.
009	1SA	025	014	And one of the servants reported to Abigaia the wife of Nabal, saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our lord; but he turned away from them.
009	1SA	025	015	And the men were very good to us; they did not hinder us, neither did they demand from us any thing all the days that we were with them.
009	1SA	025	016	And when we were in the field, they were as a wall round about us, both by night and by day, all the days that we were with them feeding the flock.
009	1SA	025	017	And now do thou consider, and see what thou wilt do; for mischief is determined against our lord and against his house; and he [is] a vile character, and one cannot speak to him.
009	1SA	025	018	And Abigaia hasted, and took two hundred loaves, and two vessels of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five ephahs of fine flour, and one homer of dried grapes, and two hundred cakes of figs, and put them upon asses.
009	1SA	025	019	And she said to her servants, Go on before me, and behold I come after you: but she told not her husband.
009	1SA	025	020	And it came to pass when she had mounted her ass and was going down by the covert of the mountain, behold, David and his men came down to meet her, and she met them.
009	1SA	025	021	And David said, Perhaps I have kept all his possessions in the wilderness that he should wrong me, and we did not order the taking anything of all his goods; yet he has rewarded me evil for good.
009	1SA	025	022	So God do to David and more also, if I leave one male of all that belong to Nabal until the morning.
009	1SA	025	023	And Abigaia saw David, and she hasted and alighted from her ass; and she felt before David on her face, and did obeisance to him, [bowing] to the ground
009	1SA	025	024	[even] to his feet, and said, On me, my lord, be my wrong: let, I pray thee, thy servant speak in thine ears, and hear thou the words of thy servant.
009	1SA	025	025	Let not my lord, I pray thee, take to heart this pestilent man, for according to his name, so is he; Nabal [is] his name, and folly [is] with him: but I thy handmaid saw not the servants of my lord whom thou didst send.
009	1SA	025	026	And now, my lord, [as] the Lord lives, and thy soul lives, as the Lord has kept thee from coming against innocent blood, and from executing vengeance for thyself, now therefore let thine enemies, and those that seek evil against my lord, become as Nabal.
009	1SA	025	027	And now accept this token of goodwill, which thy servant has brought to my lord, and thou shalt give it to the servants that wait on my lord.
009	1SA	025	028	Remove, I pray thee, the trespass of thy servant; for the Lord will surely make for my lord a sure house, for the Lord fights the battles of my lord, and there shall no evil be ever found in thee.
009	1SA	025	029	And [if] a man shall rise up persecuting thee and seeking thy life, yet shall the life of my lord be bound up in the bundle of life with the Lord God, and thou shalt whirl the life of thine enemies [as] in the midst of a sling.
009	1SA	025	030	And it shall be when the Lord shall have wrought for my lord all the good things he has spoken concerning thee, and shall appoint thee to be ruler over Israel;
009	1SA	025	031	then this shall not be an abomination and offence to my lord, to have shed innocent blood without cause, and for my lord to have avenged himself: and so may the Lord do good to my lord, and thou shalt remember thine handmaid to do her good.
009	1SA	025	032	And David said to Abigaia, Blessed [be] the Lord God of Israel, who sent thee this very day to meet me:
009	1SA	025	033	and blessed [be] thy conduct, and blessed [be] thou, who hast hindered me this very day from coming to shed blood, and from avenging myself.
009	1SA	025	034	But surely as the Lord God of Israel lives, who hindered me this day from doing thee harm, if thou hadst not hasted and come to meet me, then I said, There shall [surely] not be left to Nabal till the morning one male.
009	1SA	025	035	And David took of her hand all that she brought to him, and said to her, Go in peace to thy house: see, I have hearkened to thy voice, and accepted thy petition.
009	1SA	025	036	And Abigaia came to Nabal: and, behold, he had a banquet in this house, as the banquet of a king, and the heart of Nabal [was] merry within him, and he [was] very drunken: and she told him nothing great or small till the morning light.
009	1SA	025	037	And it came to pass in the morning, when Nabal recovered from his wine, his wife told him these words; and his heart died within him, and he became as a stone.
009	1SA	025	038	And it came to pass after about ten days, that the Lord smote Nabal, and he died.
009	1SA	025	039	And David heard it and said, Blessed [be] the Lord, who has judged the cause of my reproach at the hand of Nabal, and has delivered his servant from the power of evil; and the Lord has returned the mischief of Nabal upon his own head. And David sent and spoke concerning Abigaia, to take her to himself for a wife.
009	1SA	025	040	So the servants of David came to Abigaia to Carmel, and spoke to her, saying, David has sent us to thee, to take thee to himself for a wife.
009	1SA	025	041	And she arose, and did reverence with her face to the earth, and said, Behold, thy servant [is] for an handmaid to wash the feet of thy servants.
009	1SA	025	042	And Abigaia arose, and mounted her ass, and five damsels followed her: and she went after the servants of David, and became his wife.
009	1SA	025	043	And David took Achinaam out of Jezrael, and they were both his wives.
009	1SA	025	044	And Saul gave Melchol his daughter, David's wife, to Phalti the son of Amis who was of Romma.
009	1SA	026	001	And the Ziphites come out of the dry country to Saul to the hill, saying, Behold, David hides himself with us in the hill Echela, opposite Jessemon.
009	1SA	026	002	And Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, and with him [went] three thousand men chosen out of Israel, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.
009	1SA	026	003	And Saul encamped in the hill of Echela in front of Jessemon, by the way, and David dwelt in the wilderness: and David saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness.
009	1SA	026	004	And David sent spies, and ascertained that Saul was come prepared out of Keila.
009	1SA	026	005	And David arose secretly, and goes into the place where Saul was sleeping, and there [was] Abenner the son of Ner, the captain of his host: and Saul was sleeping in a chariot, and the people had encamped along round about him.
009	1SA	026	006	And David answered and spoke to Abimelech the Chettite, and to Abessa the son Saruia the brother of Joab, saying, Who will go in with me to Saul into the camp? And Abessa said, I will go in with thee.
009	1SA	026	007	So David and Abessa go in among the people by night: and behold, Saul was fast asleep in the chariot, and his spear was stuck in the ground near his head, and Abenner and his people slept round about him.
009	1SA	026	008	And Abessa said to David, The Lord has this day shut up thine enemy into thine hands, and now I will smite him to the earth with the spear to the ground once [for all], and I will not smite him again.
009	1SA	026	009	And David said to Abessa, Do not lay him low, for who shall lift up his hand against the anointed of the Lord, and be guiltless?
009	1SA	026	010	And David said, [As] the Lord lives, if the Lord smite him not, or his day come and he die, or he go down to battle and be added [to his fathers, do not so].
009	1SA	026	011	The Lord forbid it me that I should lift up my hand against the anointed of the Lord: and now take, I pray thee, the spear from his bolster, and the pitcher of water, and let us return home.
009	1SA	026	012	So David took the spear, and the pitcher of water from his bolster, and they went home: and there was no one that saw, and no one that knew, and there was no one that awoke, all being asleep, for a stupor from the Lord had fallen upon them.
009	1SA	026	013	So David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of a hill afar off, and [there was] a good distance between them.
009	1SA	026	014	And David called to the people, and spoke to Abenner, saying, Wilt thou not answer, Abenner? and Abenner answered and said, Who art thou that callest?
009	1SA	026	015	And David said to Abenner, [Art] not thou a man? and who [is] like thee in Israel? Why then dost thou not guard thy lord the king? for one out of the people went in to destroy thy lord the king.
009	1SA	026	016	And this thing [is] not good which thou hast done. [As] the Lord lives, ye are worthy of death, ye who guard your lord the king, the anointed of the Lord: and now behold, I pray you, the spear of the king, and the cruse of water: where are the articles that should be at his head?
009	1SA	026	017	And Saul recognized the voice of David, and said, [Is] this thy voice, son David? and David said, I [am] thy servant, [my] lord, O king.
009	1SA	026	018	And he said, Why does my lord thus pursue after his servant? for in what have I sinned? and what unrighteousness has been found in me?
009	1SA	026	019	And now let my lord the king hear the word of his servant. If God stirs thee up against me, let thine offering be acceptable: but if the sons of men, they [are] cursed before the Lord, for they have cast me out this day so that I should not be established in the inheritance of the Lord, saying, Go, serve other Gods.
009	1SA	026	020	And now let not my blood fall to the ground before the Lord, for the king of Israel has come forth to seek thy life, as the night hawk pursues [its prey] in the mountains.
009	1SA	026	021	And Saul said, I have sinned: turn, son David, for I will not hurt thee, because my life was precious in thine eyes; and to-day I have been foolish and have erred exceedingly.
009	1SA	026	022	And David answered and said, Behold, the spear of the king: let one of the servants come over and take it.
009	1SA	026	023	And the Lord shall recompense each according to his righteousness and his truth, since the Lord delivered thee this day into my hands, and I would not lift my hand against the Lord's anointed.
009	1SA	026	024	And, behold, as thy life has been precious this very day in my eyes, so let my life be precious before the Lord, and may he protect me, and deliver me out of all affliction.
009	1SA	026	025	And Saul said to David, Blessed [be] thou, [my] son; and thou shalt surely do valiantly, and surely prevail. And David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place.
009	1SA	027	001	And David said in his heart, Now shall I be one day delivered [for death] into the hands of Saul; and there is no good thing for me unless I should escape into the land of the Philistines, and Saul should cease from seeking me through every coast of Israel: so I shall escape out of his hand.
009	1SA	027	002	So David arose, and the six hundred men that were with him, and he went to Anchus, son Ammach, king of Geth.
009	1SA	027	003	And David dwelt with Anchus, he and his men, each with his family; and David and both his wives, Achinaam, the Jezraelitess, and Abigaia the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.
009	1SA	027	004	And it was told Saul that David had fled to Geth; and he no longer sought after him.
009	1SA	027	005	And David said to Anchus, If now thy servant has found grace in thine eyes, let them give me, I pray thee, a place in one of the cities in the country, and I will dwell there: for why does thy servant dwell with thee in a royal city?
009	1SA	027	006	And he gave him Sekelac in that day: therefore Sekelac came into possession of the king of Judea to this day.
009	1SA	027	007	And the number of the days that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines was four months.
009	1SA	027	008	And David and his men went up, and made an attack on all the Gesirites and on the Amalekites: and behold, the land was inhabited, (even the land from Gelampsur) by those who come from the fortified [cities] even to the land of Egypt.
009	1SA	027	009	And he smote the land, and saved neither man nor woman alive; and they took flocks, and herds, and asses, and camels, and raiment; and they returned and came to Anchus.
009	1SA	027	010	And Anchus said to David, On whom have ye made an attack to-day? And David said to Anchus, On the south of Judea, and on the south of Jesmega, and on the south of the Kenezite.
009	1SA	027	011	And I have not saved man or woman alive to bring them to Geth, saying, Lest they carry a report to Geth against us, saying, These things David does. And this was his manner all the days that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines.
009	1SA	027	012	So David had the full confidence of Anchus, who said, He is thoroughly disgraced among his people in Israel and he shall be my servant for ever.
009	1SA	028	001	And it came to pass in those days that the Philistines gathered themselves together with their armies to go out to fight with Israel; and Anchus said to David, Know surely, that thou shalt go forth to battle with me, [thou], and thy men.
009	1SA	028	002	And David said to Anchus, Thus now thou shalt know what thy servant will do. And Anchus said to David, So will I make thee captain of my body-guard continually.
009	1SA	028	003	And Samuel died, and all Israel lamented for him, and they bury him in his city, in Armathaim. And Saul had removed those who had in them divining spirits, and the wizards, out of the land.
009	1SA	028	004	And the Philistines assemble themselves, and come and encamp in Sonam: and Saul gathers all the men of Israel, and they encamp in Gelbue.
009	1SA	028	005	And Saul saw the camp of the Philistines, and he was alarmed, and his heart was greatly dismayed.
009	1SA	028	006	And Saul enquired of the Lord; and the Lord answered him not by dreams, nor by manifestations, nor by prophets.
009	1SA	028	007	Then Saul said to his servants, Seek for me a woman who has in her a divining spirit, and I will go to her, and enquire of her: and his servants said to him, Behold, [there is] a woman who has in her a divining spirit at Aendor.
009	1SA	028	008	And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he goes, and two men with him, and they come to the woman by night; and he said to her, Divine to me, I pray thee, by the divining spirit within thee, and bring up to me him whom I shall name to thee.
009	1SA	028	009	And the woman said to him, Behold now, thou knowest what Saul has done, how he has cut off those who had in them divining spirits, and the wizards from the land, and why dost thou spread a snare for my life to destroy it?
009	1SA	028	010	And Saul swore to her, and said, [As] the Lord lives, no injury shall come upon thee on this account.
009	1SA	028	011	And the woman said, Whom shall I bring up to thee? and he said, Bring up to me Samuel.
009	1SA	028	012	And the woman saw Samuel, and cried out with a loud voice: and the woman said to Saul, Why hast thou deceived me? for thou art Saul.
009	1SA	028	013	And the king said to her, Fear not; tell me whom thou has seen. And the woman said to him, I saw gods ascending out of the earth.
009	1SA	028	014	And he said to her, What didst thou perceive? and she said to him, An upright man ascending out of the earth, and he [was] clothed with a mantle. And Saul knew that this was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to the earth, and did obeisance to him.
009	1SA	028	015	And Samuel said, Why hast thou troubled me, that I should come up? And Saul said, I am greatly distressed, and the Philistines war against me, and God has departed from me, and no longer hearkens to me either by the hand of the prophets or by dreams: and now I have called thee to tell me what I shall do.
009	1SA	028	016	And Samuel said, Why askest thou me, whereas the Lord has departed from thee, and taken part with thy neighbour?
009	1SA	028	017	And the Lord has done to thee, as the Lord spoke by me; and the Lord will rend thy kingdom out of thy hand, and will give it to thy neighbour David.
009	1SA	028	018	because thou didst not hearken to the voice of the Lord, and didst not execute his fierce anger upon Amalec, therefore the Lord has done this thing to thee this day.
009	1SA	028	019	And the Lord shall deliver Israel with thee into the hands of the Philistines, and to-morrow thou and thy sons with thee shall fall, and the Lord shall deliver the army of Israel into the hands of the Philistines.
009	1SA	028	020	And Saul instantly fell at his full length upon the earth, and was greatly afraid because of the words of Samuel; and there was no longer any strength in him, for he had eaten no bread all that day, and all that night.
009	1SA	028	021	And the woman went in to Saul, and saw that he was greatly disquieted, and said to him, Behold now, thine handmaid has hearkened to thy voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have heard the words which thou has spoken to me.
009	1SA	028	022	And now hearken, I pray thee, to the voice of thine handmaid, and I will set before thee a morsel of bread, and eat, and thou shalt be strengthened, for thou wilt be going on thy way.
009	1SA	028	023	But he would not eat; so his servants and the woman constrained him, and he hearkened to their voice, and rose up from the earth, and sat upon a bench.
009	1SA	028	024	And the woman had a fat heifer in the house; and she hasted and slew it; and she took meal and kneaded it, and baked unleavened cakes.
009	1SA	028	025	And she brought [the meat] before Saul, and before his servants; and they ate, and rose up, and departed that night.
009	1SA	029	001	And the Philistines gather all their armies to Aphec, and Israel encamped in Aendor, which is in Jezrael.
009	1SA	029	002	And the lords of the Philistines went on by hundreds and thousands, and David and his men went on in the rear with Anchus.
009	1SA	029	003	And the lords of the Philistines said, Who [are] these that pass by? And Anchus said to the captains of the Philistines, [Is] not this David the servant of Saul king of Israel? He has been with us some time, even this second year, and I have not found any fault in him from the day that he attached himself to me even until this day.
009	1SA	029	004	And the captains of the Philistines were displeased at him, and they say to him, Send the man away, and let him return to his place, where thou didst set him; and let him not come with us to the war, and let him not be a traitor in the camp: and wherewith will he be reconciled to his master? Will it not be with the heads of those men?
009	1SA	029	005	[Is] not this David whom they celebrated in dances, saying, Saul has smitten his thousands, and David his ten thousands?
009	1SA	029	006	And Anchus called David, and said to him, [As] the Lord lives, thou [art] right and approved in my eyes, and [so is] thy going out and thy coming in with me in the army, and I have not found [any] evil to charge against thee from the day that thou camest to me until this day: but thou art not approved in the eyes of the lords.
009	1SA	029	007	Now then return and go in peace, thus thou shalt not do evil in the sight of the lords of the Philistines.
009	1SA	029	008	And David said to Anchus, What have I done to thee? and what hast thou found in thy servant from the [first] day that I was before thee even until this day, that I should not come and war against the enemies of the lord my king?
009	1SA	029	009	And Anchus answered David, I know that thou [art] good in my eyes, but the lords of the Philistines say, He shall not come with us to the war.
009	1SA	029	010	Now then rise up early in the morning, thou and the servants of thy lord that are come with thee, and go to the place where I appointed you, and entertain no evil thought in thy heart, for thou [art] good in my sight: and rise early for your journey when it is light, and depart.
009	1SA	029	011	So David arose early, he and his men, to depart and guard the land of the Philistines: and the Philistines went up to Jezrael to battle.
009	1SA	030	001	And it came to pass when David and his men had entered Sekelac on the third day, that Amalec had made an incursion upon the south, and upon Sekelac, and smitten Sekelac, and burnt it with fire.
009	1SA	030	002	And as to the women and all things that were in it, great and small, they slew neither man nor woman, but carried them captives, and went on their way.
009	1SA	030	003	And David and his men came into the city, and, behold, it was burnt with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters were carried captive.
009	1SA	030	004	And David and his men lifted up their voice, and wept till there was no longer any power within them to weep.
009	1SA	030	005	And both the wives of David were carried captive, Achinaam, the Jezraelitess, and Abigaia the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.
009	1SA	030	006	And David was greatly distressed, because the people spoke of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, each for his sons and his daughters: but David strengthened himself in the Lord his God.
009	1SA	030	007	And David said to Abiathar the priest the son of Achimelech, Bring near the ephod.
009	1SA	030	008	And David enquired of the Lord, saying, Shall I pursue after this troop? shall I overtake them? and he said to him, Pursue, for thou shalt surely overtake them, and thou shalt surely rescue [the captives].
009	1SA	030	009	So David went, he an the six hundred men with him, an they come as far as the brook Bosor, and the superfluous ones stopped.
009	1SA	030	010	And he pursued them with four hundred men; and there remained behind two hundred men, who tarried on the other side of the brook Bosor.
009	1SA	030	011	And they find an Egyptian in the field, and they take him, and bring him to David; and they gave him bread and he ate, and they caused him to drink water.
009	1SA	030	012	And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and he ate, and his spirit was restored in him; for he had not eaten bread, and had not drunk water three days and three nights.
009	1SA	030	013	And David said to him, Whose art thou? and whence art thou? and the young man the Egyptian said, I am the servant of an Amalekite; and my master left me, because I was taken ill three days ago.
009	1SA	030	014	And we made an incursion on the south of the Chelethite, and on the parts of Judea, and on the south of Chelub, and we burnt Sekelac with fire.
009	1SA	030	015	And David said to him, Wilt thou bring me down to this troop? And he said, Swear now to me by God, that thou wilt not kill me, and that thou wilt not deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will bring thee down upon this troop.
009	1SA	030	016	So be brought him down thither, and behold, they [were] scattered abroad upon the surface of the whole land, eating and drinking, and feasting by [reason of] all the great spoils which they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Juda.
009	1SA	030	017	And David came upon them, and smote them from the morning till the evening, and on the next day; and not one of them escaped, except four hundred young men, who were mounted on camels, and fled.
009	1SA	030	018	And David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken, and he rescued both his wives.
009	1SA	030	019	And nothing was wanting to them of great or small, either of the spoils, or the sons and daughters, or anything that they had taken of theirs; and David recovered all.
009	1SA	030	020	And he took all the flocks, and the herds, and led them away before the spoils: and it was said of these spoils, These [are] the spoils of David.
009	1SA	030	021	And David comes to the two hundred men who were left behind that they should not follow after David, and he had caused them to remain by the brook of Bosor; and they came forth to meet David, and to meet his people with him: and David drew near to the people, and they asked him how he did.
009	1SA	030	022	Then every ill-disposed and bad man of the soldiers who had gone with David, answered and said, Because they did not pursue together with us, we will not give them of the spoils which we have recovered, only let each one lead away with him his wife and his children, and let them return.
009	1SA	030	023	And David said, Ye shall not do so, after the Lord has delivered [the enemy] to us, and guarded us, and the Lord has delivered into our hands the troop that came against u.
009	1SA	030	024	And who will hearken to these your words? for they are not inferior to us; for according to the portion of him that went down to the battle, so shall be the portion of him that abides with the baggage; they shall share alike.
009	1SA	030	025	And it came to pass from that day forward, that it became an ordinance and a custom in Israel until this day.
009	1SA	030	026	And David came to Sekelac, and sent of the spoils to the elders of Juda, and to his friends, saying, Behold [some] of the spoils of the enemies of the Lord;
009	1SA	030	027	to those in Baethsur, and to those in Rama of the south, and to those in Gethor.
009	1SA	030	028	And to those in Aroer, and to those in Ammadi, and to those in Saphi, and to those in Esthie,
009	1SA	030	029	and to those in Geth, and to those in Cimath, and to those in Saphec, and to those in Themath, and to those in Carmel, and to those in the cities of Jeremeel, and to those in the cities of the Kenezite;
009	1SA	030	030	and to those in Jerimuth, and to those in Bersabee, and to those in Nombe,
009	1SA	030	031	and to those in Chebron, and to all the places which David and his men had passed through.
009	1SA	031	001	And the Philistines fought with Israel: and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and they fall down wounded in the mountain in Gelbue.
009	1SA	031	002	And the Philistines press closely on Saul and his sons, and the Philistines smite Jonathan, and Aminadab, and Melchisa son of Saul.
009	1SA	031	003	And the battle prevails against Saul, and the shooters with arrows, even the archers find him, and he was wounded under the ribs.
009	1SA	031	004	And Saul said to his armour-bearer, Draw thy sword and pierce me through with it; lest these uncircumcised come and pierce me through, and mock me. But his armour-bearer would not, for he feared greatly: so Saul took his sword and fell upon it.
009	1SA	031	005	And his armour-bearer saw that Saul was dead, and he fell also himself upon his sword, and died with him.
009	1SA	031	006	So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armour-bearer, in that day together.
009	1SA	031	007	And the men of Israel who were on the other side of the valley, and those beyond Jordan, saw that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead; and they leave their cities and flee: and the Philistines come and dwell in them.
009	1SA	031	008	And it came to pass on the morrow that the Philistines come to strip the dead, and they find Saul and his three sons fallen on the mountains of Gelbue.
009	1SA	031	009	And they turned him, and stripped off his armour, and sent it into the land of the Philistines, sending round glad tidings to their idols and to the people.
009	1SA	031	010	And they set up his armour at the temple of Astarte, and they fastened his body on the wall of Baethsam.
009	1SA	031	011	And the inhabitants of Jabis Galaad hear what the Philistines did to Saul.
009	1SA	031	012	And they rose up, [even] every man of might, and marched all night, and took the body of Saul and the body of Jonathan his son from the wall of Baethsam; and they bring them to Jabis, and burn them there.
009	1SA	031	013	And they take their bones, and bury them in the field that is in Jabis, and fast seven days.

# BOOK	010	2SA	2 Samuel	Kings II
010	2SA	001	001	And it came to pass after Saul was dead, that David returned from smiting Amalec, and David abode two days in Sekelac.
010	2SA	001	002	And it came to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came from the camp, from the people of Saul, and his garments were rent, and earth [was] upon his head: and it came to pass when he went in to David, that he fell upon the earth, and did obeisance to him.
010	2SA	001	003	And David said to him, Whence comest thou? and he said to him, I have escaped out of the camp of Israel.
010	2SA	001	004	And David said to him, What [is] the matter? tell me. And he said, The people fled out of the battle, and many of the people have fallen and are dead, and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead.
010	2SA	001	005	And David said to the young man who brought him the tidings, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?
010	2SA	001	006	And the young man that brought the tidings, said to him, I happened accidentally to be upon mount Gelbue; and, behold, Saul was leaning upon his spear, and, behold, the chariots and captains of horse pressed hard upon him.
010	2SA	001	007	And he looked behind him, and saw me, and called me; and I said, Behold, [here am] I.
010	2SA	001	008	And he said to me, Who art thou? and I said, I am an Amalekite.
010	2SA	001	009	And he said to me, Stand, I pray thee, over me, and slay me, for a dreadful darkness has come upon me, for all my life [is] in me.
010	2SA	001	010	So I stood over him and slew him, because I knew he would not live after he was fallen; and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was upon his arm, and I have brought them hither to my lord.
010	2SA	001	011	And David laid hold of his garments, and rent them; and all the men who were with him rent their garments.
010	2SA	001	012	And they lamented, and wept, and fasted till evening, for Saul and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of Juda, and for the house of Israel, because they were smitten with the sword.
010	2SA	001	013	And David said to the young man who brought the tidings to him, Whence art thou? and he said, I am the son of an Amalekite sojourner.
010	2SA	001	014	And David said to him, How was it thou wast not afraid to lift thy hand to destroy the anointed of the Lord?
010	2SA	001	015	And David called one of his young men, and said, Go and fall upon him: and he smote him, and he died.
010	2SA	001	016	And David said to him, Thy blood [be] upon thine own head; for thy mouth has testified against thee, saying, I have slain the anointed of the Lord.
010	2SA	001	017	And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son.
010	2SA	001	018	And he gave orders to teach it the sons of Juda: behold, it is written in the book of Right.
010	2SA	001	019	Set up a pillar, O Israel, for the slain that died upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen!
010	2SA	001	020	Tell it not in Geth, and tell it not as glad tidings in the streets of Ascalon, lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.
010	2SA	001	021	Ye mountains of Gelbue, let not dew no rain descend upon you, nor fields of first-fruits [be upon you], for there the shield of the mighty ones has been grievously assailed; the shield of Saul was not anointed with oil.
010	2SA	001	022	From the blood of the slain, and from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan returned not empty; and the sword of Saul turned not back empty.
010	2SA	001	023	Saul and Jonathan, the beloved and the beautiful, were not divided: comely [were they] in their life, and in their death they were not divided: [they were] swifter than eagles, and they were stronger than lions.
010	2SA	001	024	Daughters of Israel, weep for Saul, who clothed you with scarlet together with your adorning, who added golden ornaments to your apparel.
010	2SA	001	025	How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan, even the slain ones upon thy high places!
010	2SA	001	026	I am grieved for thee, my brother Jonathan; thou wast very lovely to me; thy love to me was wonderful beyond the love of women.
010	2SA	001	027	How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!
010	2SA	002	001	And it came to pass after this that David enquired of the Lord, saying, Shall I go up into one of the cities of Juda? and the Lord said to him, Go up. And David said, Whither shall I go up? and he said, To Chebron.
010	2SA	002	002	And David went up thither to Chebron, [he] and both his wives, Achinaam the Jezraelitess, and Abigaia the wife of Nabal the Carmelite,
010	2SA	002	003	and the men that were with him, every one and his family; and they dwelt in the cities of Chebron.
010	2SA	002	004	And the men of Judea come, and anoint David there to reign over the house of Juda; and they reported to David, saying, The men of Jabis of the country of Galaad have buried Saul.
010	2SA	002	005	And David sent messengers to the rulers of Jabis of the country of Galaad, and David said to them, Blessed be ye of the Lord, because ye have wrought this mercy toward your lord, even toward Saul the anointed of the Lord, and ye have buried him and Jonathan his son.
010	2SA	002	006	And now may the Lord deal in mercy and truth towards you: and I also will requite towards you this good deed, because ye have done this.
010	2SA	002	007	And now let your hands be made strong, and be valiant; for your master Saul is dead, and moreover the house of Juda have anointed me to be king over them.
010	2SA	002	008	But Abenner, the son of Ner, the commander-in-chief of Saul's army, took Jebosthe son of Saul, and brought him up from the camp to Manaem
010	2SA	002	009	and made him king over the land of Galaad, and over Thasiri, and over Jezrael, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.
010	2SA	002	010	Jebosthe, Saul's son [was] forty years old, when he reigned over Israel; and he reigned two years, but not over the house of Juda, who followed David.
010	2SA	002	011	And the days which David reigned in Chebron over the house of Juda were seven years and six months.
010	2SA	002	012	And Abenner the son of Ner went forth, and the servants of Jebosthe the son of Saul, from Manaem to Gabaon.
010	2SA	002	013	And Joab the son of Saruia, and the servants of David, went forth from Chebron, and met them at the fountain of Gabaon, at the same place: and these sat down by the fountain on this side, and those by the fountain on that side.
010	2SA	002	014	And Abenner said to Joab, Let now the young men arise, and play before us. And Joab said, Let them arise.
010	2SA	002	015	And there arose and passed over by number twelve of the children of Benjamin, belonging to Jebosthe the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David.
010	2SA	002	016	And they seized every one the head of his neighbour with his hand, and his sword [was thrust] into the side of his neighbour, and they fall down together: and the name of that place was called The portion of the treacherous ones, which is in Gabaon.
010	2SA	002	017	And the battle was very severe on that day; and Abenner and the men of Israel were worsted before the servants of David.
010	2SA	002	018	And there were there the three sons of Saruia, Joab, and Abessa, and Asael: and Asael was swift in his feet as a roe in the field.
010	2SA	002	019	And Asael followed after Abenner, and turned not to go to the right hand or to the left from following Abenner.
010	2SA	002	020	And Abenner looked behind him, and said, Art thou Asael himself? and he said, I am.
010	2SA	002	021	And Abenner said to him, Turn thou to the right hand or to the left, and lay hold for thyself on one of the young men, and take to thyself his armour: but Asel would not turn back from following him.
010	2SA	002	022	And Abenner said yet again to Asael, Stand aloof from me, lest I smite thee to the ground? and how should I lift up my face to Joab?
010	2SA	002	023	And what does this mean? return to Joab thy brother? But he would not stand aloof; and Abenner smites him with the hinder end of the spear on the loins, and the spear went out behind him, and he falls there and dies on the spot: and it came to pass that every one that came to the place where Asael fell and died, stood still.
010	2SA	002	024	And Joab and Abessa pursued after Abenner, and the sun went down: and they went as far as the hill of Amman, which is in the front of Gai, by the desert way of Gabaon.
010	2SA	002	025	And the children of Benjamin who followed Abenner gather themselves together, and they formed themselves into one body, and stood on the top of a hill.
010	2SA	002	026	And Abenner called Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour perpetually? knowest thou not that it will be bitter at last? How long then wilt thou refuse to tell the people to turn from following our brethren?
010	2SA	002	027	And Joab said, As the Lord lives, if thou hadst not spoken, even from the morning the people had gone up every one from following his brother.
010	2SA	002	028	And Joab sounded the trumpet, and all the people departed, and did not pursue after Israel, and did not fight any longer.
010	2SA	002	029	And Abenner and his men departed at evening, [and went] all that night, and crossed over Jordan, and went along the whole adjacent [country], and they come to the camp.
010	2SA	002	030	And Joab returned from following Abenner, and he assembled all the people, and there were missing of the people of David, nineteen men, and Asael.
010	2SA	002	031	And the servants of David smote of the children of Benjamin, of the men of Abenner, three hundred and sixty men belonging to him.
010	2SA	002	032	And they take up Asael, and bury him in the tomb of his father in Bethleem. And Joab and the men with him went all the night, and the morning rose upon them in Chebron.
010	2SA	003	001	And there was war for a long time between the house of Saul and the house of David; and the house of David grew continually stronger; but the house of Saul grew continually weaker.
010	2SA	003	002	And sons were born to David in Chebron: and his first-born was Ammon the son of Achinoom the Jezraelitess.
010	2SA	003	003	And his second son [was] Daluia, the son of Abigaia the Carmelitess; and the third, Abessalom the son of Maacha the daughter of Tholmi the king of Gessir.
010	2SA	003	004	And the fourth [was] Ornia, the son of Aggith, and the fifth [was] Saphatia, the son of Abital.
010	2SA	003	005	And the sixth [was] Jetheraam, the son of Aegal the wife of David. These were born to David in Chebron.
010	2SA	003	006	And it came to pass while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abenner was governing the house of Saul.
010	2SA	003	007	And Saul had a concubine, Respha, the daughter of Jol; and Jebosthe the son of Saul said to Abenner, Why hast thou gone in to my father's concubine?
010	2SA	003	008	And Abenner was very angry with Jebosthe for this saying; and Abenner said to him, Am I a dog's head? I have this day wrought kindness with the house of Saul thy father, and with his brethren and friends, and have not gone over to the house of David, and dost thou this day seek a charge against me concerning injury to a woman?
010	2SA	003	009	God do thus and more also to Abenner, if as the Lord swore to David, so do I not to him this day;
010	2SA	003	010	to take away the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to raise up the throne of David over Israel and over Juda from Dan to Bersabee.
010	2SA	003	011	And Jebosthe could not any longer answer Abenner a word, because he feared him.
010	2SA	003	012	And Abenner sent messengers to David to Thaelam where he was, immediately, saying, Make thy covenant with me, and, behold, my hand [is] with thee to bring back to thee all the house of Israel.
010	2SA	003	013	And David said, With a good will I will make with thee a covenant: only I demand one condition of thee, saying, Thou shalt not see my face, unless thou bring Melchol the daughter of Saul, when thou comest to see my face.
010	2SA	003	014	And David sent messengers to Jebosthe the son of Saul, saying, Restore me my wife Melchol, whom I took for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines.
010	2SA	003	015	And Jebosthe sent, and took her from her husband, [even] from Phaltiel the son of Selle.
010	2SA	003	016	And her husband went with her weeping behind her as far as Barakim. And Abenner said to him, Go, return; and he returned.
010	2SA	003	017	And Abenner spoke to the elders of Israel, saying, In former days ye sought David to reign over you;
010	2SA	003	018	and now perform [it]: for the Lord has spoken concerning David, saying, By the hand of my servant David I will save Israel out of the hand of all their enemies.
010	2SA	003	019	And Abenner spoke in the ears of Benjamin: and Abenner went to speak in the ears of David at Chebron, all that seemed good in the eyes of Israel and in the eyes of the house of Benjamin.
010	2SA	003	020	And Abenner came to David to Chebron, and with him twenty men: and David made for Abenner and his men with him a banquet of wine.
010	2SA	003	021	And Abenner said to David, I will arise now, and go, and gather to my lord the king all Israel; and I will make with him a covenant, and thou shalt reign over all whom thy soul desires. And David sent away Abenner, and he departed in peace.
010	2SA	003	022	And, behold, the servants of David and Joab arrived from their expedition, and they brought much spoil with them: and Abenner was not with David in Chebron, because he had sent him away, and he had departed in peace.
010	2SA	003	023	And Joab and all his army came, and it was reported to Joab, saying, Abenner the son of Ner is come to David, and David has let him go, and he has departed in peace.
010	2SA	003	024	And Joab went in to the king, and said, What [is] this [that] thou hast done? behold, Abenner came to thee; and why hast thou let him go, and he has departed in peace?
010	2SA	003	025	Knowest thou not the mischief of Abenner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all things that thou doest?
010	2SA	003	026	And Joab returned from David, and sent messengers to Abenner after [him]; and they bring him back from the well of Seiram: but David knew [it] not.
010	2SA	003	027	And he brought back Abenner to Chebron, and Joab caused him to turn aside from the gate to speak to him, laying wait for him: and he smote him there in the loins, and he died for the blood of Asael the brother of Joab.
010	2SA	003	028	And David heard [of it] afterwards, and said, I and my kingdom are guiltless before the Lord even for ever of the blood of Abenner the son of Ner.
010	2SA	003	029	Let it fall upon the head of Joab, and upon all the house of his father; and let there not be wanting of the house of Joab one that has an issue, or a leper, or that leans on a staff, or that falls by the sword, or that wants bread.
010	2SA	003	030	For Joab and Abessa his brother laid wait continually for Abenner, because he slew Asael their brother at Gabaon in the battle.
010	2SA	003	031	And David said to Joab and to all the people with him, Rend your garments, and gird yourselves with sackcloth, and lament before Abenner. And king David followed the bier.
010	2SA	003	032	And they bury Abenner in Chebron: and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at his tomb, and all the people wept for Abenner.
010	2SA	003	033	And the king mourned over Abenner, and said, Shall Abenner die according to the death of Nabal?
010	2SA	003	034	Thy hands were not bound, and thy feet [were] not [put] in fetters: [one] brought [thee] not near as Nabal; thou didst fall before children of iniquity.
010	2SA	003	035	And all the people assembled to weep for him. And all the people came to cause David to eat bread while it was yet day: and David swore, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if I eat bread or any thing else before the sun goes down.
010	2SA	003	036	And all the people took notice, and all things that the king did before the people were pleasing in their sight.
010	2SA	003	037	So all the people and all Israel perceived in that day, that it was not of the king to slay Abenner the son of Ner.
010	2SA	003	038	And the king said to his servants, Know ye not that a great prince is this day fallen in Israel?
010	2SA	003	039	And that I am this day a [mere] kinsman [of his], and [as it were] a subject; but these men the sons of Saruia are too hard for me: the Lord reward the evil-doer according to his wickedness.
010	2SA	004	001	And Jebosthe the son of Saul heard that Abenner the son of Ner had died in Chebron; and his hands were paralyzed, and all the men of Israel grew faint.
010	2SA	004	002	And Jebosthe the son of Saul had two men that were captains of bands: the name of the one [was] Baana, and the name of the other Rechab, sons of Remmon the Berothite of the children of Benjamin; for Beroth was reckoned to the children of Benjamin.
010	2SA	004	003	And the Berothites ran away to Gethaim, and were sojourners there until this day.
010	2SA	004	004	And Jonathan Saul's son [had] a son lame of his feet, five years old, and he was [in the way] when the news of Saul and Jonathan his son came from Jezrael, and his nurse took him up, and fled; and it came to pass as he hasted and retreated, that he fell, and was lamed. And his name [was] Memphibosthe.
010	2SA	004	005	And Rechab and Baana the sons of Remmon the Berothite went, and they came in the heat of the day into the house of Jebosthe; and he was sleeping on a bed at noon.
010	2SA	004	006	And, behold, the porter of the house winnowed wheat, and he slumbered and slept: and the brothers Rechab and Baana went privily into the house:
010	2SA	004	007	And Jebosthe was sleeping on his bed in his chamber: and they smite him, and slay him, and take off his head: and they took his head, and went all the night by the western road.
010	2SA	004	008	And they brought the head of Jebosthe to David to Chebron, and they said to the king, Behold the head of Jebosthe the son of Saul thy enemy, who sought thy life; and the Lord has executed for my lord the king vengeance on his enemies, as [it is] this day: even on Saul thy enemy, and on his seed.
010	2SA	004	009	And David answered and Rechab and Baana his brother, the sons of Remmon the Berothite, and said to them, [As] the Lord lives, who has redeemed my soul out of all affliction;
010	2SA	004	010	he that reported to me that Saul was dead, even he was as one bringing glad tidings before me: but I seized him and slew him in Sekelac, to whom I ought, [as he thought], to have given a reward for his tidings.
010	2SA	004	011	And now evil men have slain a righteous men in his house on his bed: now then I will require his blood of your hand, and I will destroy you from off the earth.
010	2SA	004	012	And David commanded his young men, and they slay them, and cut off their hands and their feet; and they hung them up at the fountain in Chebron: and they buried the head of Jebosthe in the tomb of Abenezer the son of Ner.
010	2SA	005	001	And all the tribes of Israel come to David to Chebron, and they said to him, Behold, we [are] thy bone and thy flesh.
010	2SA	005	002	And heretofore Saul being king over us, thou was he that didst lead out and bring in Israel: and the Lord said to thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be for a leader to my people Israel.
010	2SA	005	003	And all the elders of Israel come to the king to Chebron; and king David made a covenant with them in Chebron before the Lord; and they anoint David king over all Israel.
010	2SA	005	004	David [was] thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.
010	2SA	005	005	Seven years and six months he reigned in Chebron over Juda, and thirty-three years he reigned over all Israel and Juda in Jerusalem.
010	2SA	005	006	And David and his men, departed to Jerusalem, to the Jebusite that inhabited the land: and it was said to David, Thou shalt not come in hither: for the blind and the lame withstood him, saying, David shall not come in hither.
010	2SA	005	007	And David took first the hold of Sion: this [is] the city of David.
010	2SA	005	008	And David said on that day, Every one that smites the Jebusite, let him attack with the dagger both the lame and the blind, and those that hate the soul of David. Therefore they say, The lame and the blind shall not enter into the house of the Lord.
010	2SA	005	009	And David dwelt in the hold, and it was called the city of David, and he built the city itself round about from the citadel, and [he built] his own house.
010	2SA	005	010	And David advanced and became great, and the Lord Almighty [was] with him.
010	2SA	005	011	And Chiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar wood, and carpenters, and stone-masons: and they built a house for David.
010	2SA	005	012	And David knew that the Lord had prepared him to be king over Israel, and that his kingdom was exalted for the sake of his people Israel.
010	2SA	005	013	And David took again wives and concubines out of Jerusalem, after he came from Chebron: and David had still more sons and daughters born to him.
010	2SA	005	014	And these [are] the names of those that were born to him in Jerusalem; Sammus, and Sobab, and Nathan, and Solomon.
010	2SA	005	015	And Ebear, and Elisue, and Naphec, and Jephies.
010	2SA	005	016	And Elisama, and Elidae, and Eliphalath, Samae, Jessibath, Nathan, Galamaan, Jebaar, Theesus, Eliphalat, Naged, Naphec, Janathan, Leasamys, Baalimath, Eliphaath.
010	2SA	005	017	And the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over Israel; and all the Philistines went up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went down to the strong hold.
010	2SA	005	018	And the Philistines came, and assembled in the valley of the giants.
010	2SA	005	019	And David enquired of the Lord, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? and wilt thou deliver them into my hands? and the Lord said to David, Go up, for I will surely deliver the Philistines into thine hands.
010	2SA	005	020	And David came from Upper Breaches, and smote the Philistines there: and David said, The Lord has destroyed the hostile Philistines before me, as water is dispersed; therefore the name of that place was called Over Breaches.
010	2SA	005	021	And they leave there their gods, and David and his men with him took them.
010	2SA	005	022	And the Philistines came up yet again, and assembled in the valley of Giants.
010	2SA	005	023	And David enquired of the Lord: and the Lord said, Thou shalt not go up to meet them: turn from them, and thou shalt meet them near the place of weeping.
010	2SA	005	024	And it shall come to pass when thou hearest the sound of a clashing together from the grove of weeping, then thou shalt go down to them, for then the Lord shall go forth before thee to make havoc in the battle with the Philistines.
010	2SA	005	025	And David did as the Lord commanded him, and smote the Philistines from Gabaon as far as the land of Gazera.
010	2SA	006	001	And David again gathered all the young men of Israel, about seventy thousand.
010	2SA	006	002	And David arose, and went, he and all the people that were with him, and some of the rulers of Juda, on an expedition [to a distant place], to bring back thence the ark of God, on which the name of the Lord of Host who dwells between the cherubs upon it is called.
010	2SA	006	003	And they put the ark of the Lord on a new waggon, and took it out of the house of Aminadab who lived on the hill, and Oza and his brethren the sons of Aminadab drove the waggon with the ark.
010	2SA	006	004	And his brethren went before the ark.
010	2SA	006	005	And David and the children of Israel [were] playing before the Lord on well-tuned instruments mightily, and with songs, and with harps, and with lutes, and with drums, and with cymbals, and with pipes.
010	2SA	006	006	And they come as far as the threshing floor of Nachor: and Oza reached forth his hand to the ark of God to keep it steady, and took hold of it; for the ox shook it out of its place.
010	2SA	006	007	And the Lord was very angry with Oza; and God smote him there: and he died there by the ark of the Lord before God.
010	2SA	006	008	And David was dispirited because the Lord made a breach upon Oza; and that place was called the breach of Oza until this day.
010	2SA	006	009	And David feared the Lord in that day, saying, How shall the ark of the Lord come in to me?
010	2SA	006	010	And David would not bring in the ark of the covenant of the Lord to himself into the city of David: and David turned it aside into the house of Abeddara the Gethite.
010	2SA	006	011	And the ark of the Lord lodged in the house of Abeddara the Gethite three months, and the Lord blessed all the house of Abeddara, and all his possessions.
010	2SA	006	012	And it was reported to king David, saying, The Lord has blessed the house of Abeddara, and all that he has, because of the ark of the Lord. And David went, and brought up the Ark of the Lord from the house of Abeddara to the city of David with gladness.
010	2SA	006	013	And there were with him bearing the ark seven bands, and for a sacrifice a calf and lambs.
010	2SA	006	014	And David sounded with well-tuned instruments before the Lord, and David [was] clothed with a fine long robe.
010	2SA	006	015	And David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the Lord with shouting, and with the sound of a trumpet.
010	2SA	006	016	And it came to pass as the ark arrived at the city of David, that Melchol the daughter of Saul looked through the window, and saw king David dancing and playing before the Lord; and she despised him in her heart.
010	2SA	006	017	And they bring the ark of the Lord, and set it in its place in the midst of the tabernacle which David pitched for it: and David offered whole-burnt-offerings before the Lord, [and] peace-offerings.
010	2SA	006	018	And David made an end of offering the whole-burnt-offerings and peace-offerings, and blessed the people in the name of the Lord of Hosts.
010	2SA	006	019	And he distributed to all the people, even to all the host of Israel from Dan to Bersabee, both men and women, to every one a cake of bread, and a joint of meat, and a cake from the frying-pan: and all the people departed every one to his home.
010	2SA	006	020	And David returned to bless his house. And Melchol the daughter of Saul came out to meet David and saluted him, and said, How was the king of Israel glorified to-day, who was to-day uncovered in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the dancers wantonly uncovers himself!
010	2SA	006	021	And David said to Melchol, I will dance before the Lord. Blessed [be] the Lord who chose me before thy father, and before all his house, to make me head over his people, even over Israel: therefore I will play, and dance before the Lord.
010	2SA	006	022	And I will again uncover myself thus, and I will be vile in thine eyes, and with the maid-servants by whom thou saidst that I was not had in honour.
010	2SA	006	023	And Melchol the daughter of Saul had no child till the day of her death.
010	2SA	007	001	And it came to pass when the king sat in his house, and the Lord had given him an inheritance on every side [free] from all his enemies round about him;
010	2SA	007	002	that the king said to Nathan the prophet, Behold now, I live in a house of cedar, and the ark of the Lord dwells in the midst of a tent.
010	2SA	007	003	And Nathan said to the king, Go and do all that [is] in thine heart, for the Lord [is] with thee.
010	2SA	007	004	And it came to pass in that night, that the word of the Lord came to Nathan, saying,
010	2SA	007	005	Go, and say to my servant David, Thus says the Lord, Thou shalt not build me a house for me to dwell in.
010	2SA	007	006	For I have not dwelt in a house from the day that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt to this day, but I have been walking in a lodge and in a tent,
010	2SA	007	007	wheresoever I went with all Israel. Have I ever spoken to any of the tribes of Israel, which I commanded to tend my people Israel, saying, Why have ye not built me a house of Cedar?
010	2SA	007	008	And now thus shalt thou say to my servant David, Thus says the Lord Almighty, I took thee from the sheep-cote, that thou shouldest be a prince over my people, over Israel.
010	2SA	007	009	And I was with thee wheresoever thou wentest, and I destroyed all thine enemies before thee, and I made thee renowned according to the renown of the great ones on the earth.
010	2SA	007	010	And I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, and they shall dwell by themselves, and shall be no more distressed; and the son of iniquity shall no more afflict them, as he [has done] from the beginning,
010	2SA	007	011	from the days when I appointed judges over my people Israel: and I will give thee rest from all thine enemies, and the Lord will tell thee that thou shalt build a house to him.
010	2SA	007	012	And it shall come to pass when thy days shall have been fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed after thee, even thine own issue, and I will establish his kingdom.
010	2SA	007	013	He shall build for me a house to my name, and I will set up his throne even for ever.
010	2SA	007	014	I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son. And when he happens to transgress, then will I chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the sons of men.
010	2SA	007	015	But my mercy I will not take from him, as I took it from those whom I removed from my presence.
010	2SA	007	016	And his house shall be made sure, and his kingdom for ever before me, and his throne shall be set up for ever.
010	2SA	007	017	According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so Nathan spoke to David.
010	2SA	007	018	And king David came in, and sat before the Lord, and said, Who am I, O Lord, my Lord, and what [is] my house, that thou hast loved me hitherto?
010	2SA	007	019	Whereas I was very little before thee, O Lord, my Lord, yet thou spokest concerning the house of thy servant for a long time to [to come]. And [is] this the law of man, O Lord, my Lord?
010	2SA	007	020	And what shall David yet say to thee? and now thou knowest thy servant, O Lord, my Lord.
010	2SA	007	021	And thou hast wrought for thy servant's sake, and according to thy heart thou hast wrought all this greatness, to make it known to thy servant,
010	2SA	007	022	that he may magnify thee, O my Lord; for there is no one like thee, and there is no God, but thou among all of whom we have heard with our ears.
010	2SA	007	023	And what other nation in the earth [is] as thy people Israel? whereas God was his guide, to redeem for himself a people to make thee a name, to do mightily and nobly, so that thou shouldest cast out nations an [their] tabernacles from the presence of thy people, whom thou didst redeem for thyself out of Egypt?
010	2SA	007	024	And thou has prepared for thyself thy people Israel to be a people for ever, and thou, Lord, art become their God.
010	2SA	007	025	And now, O my Lord, the Almighty Lord God of Israel, confirm the word for ever which thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and his house: and now as thou hast said,
010	2SA	007	026	Let thy name be magnified for ever.
010	2SA	007	027	Almighty Lord God of Israel, thou hast uncovered the ear of thy servant, saying, I will build thee a house: therefore thy servant has found [in] his heart to pray this prayer to thee.
010	2SA	007	028	And now, O Lord my Lord, thou art God; and thy words will be true, and thou hast spoken these good things concerning thy servant.
010	2SA	007	029	And now begin and bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee; for thou, O Lord, my Lord, hast spoken, and the house of thy servant shall be blessed with thy blessing so as to continue for ever.
010	2SA	008	001	And it came to pass after this, that David smote the Philistines, and put them to flight, and David took the tribute from out of the hand of the Philistines.
010	2SA	008	002	And David smote Moab, and measured them out with lines, having laid them down on the ground: and there were two lines for slaying, and two lines he kept alive: and Moab became servants to David, yielding tribute.
010	2SA	008	003	And David smote Adraazar the son of Raab king of Suba, as he went to extend his power to the river Euphrates.
010	2SA	008	004	And David took a thousand of his chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: and David houghed all his chariot [horses], and he reserved to himself a hundred chariots.
010	2SA	008	005	And Syria of Damascus comes to help Adraazar king of Suba, and David smote twenty-two thousand men belonging to the Syrian.
010	2SA	008	006	And David placed a garrison in Syria near Damascus, and the Syrians became servants and tributaries to David: and the Lord preserved David whithersoever he went.
010	2SA	008	007	And David took the golden bracelets which were on the servants of Adraazar king of Suba, and brought them to Jerusalem. And Susakim king of Egypt took them, when he went up to Jerusalem in the days of Roboam son of Solomon.
010	2SA	008	008	And king David took from Metebac, and from the choice cities of Adraazar, very much brass: with that Solomon made the brazen sea, and the pillars, and the lavers, and all the furniture.
010	2SA	008	009	And Thou the king of Hemath heard that David had smitten all the host of Adraazar.
010	2SA	008	010	And Thou sent Jedduram his son to king David, to ask him of his welfare, and to congratulate him on his fighting against Adraazar and smiting him, for he was an enemy to Adraazar: and in his hands were vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of brass.
010	2SA	008	011	And these king David consecrated to the Lord, with the silver and with the gold which he consecrated out of all the cities which he conquered,
010	2SA	008	012	out of Idumea, and out of Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalec, and from the spoils of Adraazar son of Raab king of Suba.
010	2SA	008	013	And David made [himself] a name: and when he returned he smote Idumea in Gebelem to [the number of] eighteen thousand.
010	2SA	008	014	And he set garrisons in Idumea, even in all Idumea: and all the Idumeans were servants to the king. And the Lord preserved David wherever he went.
010	2SA	008	015	And David reigned over all Israel: and David wrought judgment and justice over all his people.
010	2SA	008	016	And Joab the son of Saruia [was] over the host; and Josaphat the son of Achilud [was keeper] of the records.
010	2SA	008	017	And Sadoc the son of Achitob, and Achimelech son of Abiathar, [were] priests; and Sasa [was] the scribe,
010	2SA	008	018	and Banaeas son of Jodae [was] councillor, and the Chelethite and the Phelethite, and the sons of David, were princes of the court.
010	2SA	009	001	And David said, Is there yet any one left in the house of Saul, that I may deal kindly with him for Jonathan's sake?
010	2SA	009	002	And there was a servant of the house of Saul, and his name was Siba: and they call him to David; and the king said to him, Art thou Siba? and he said, I [am] thy servant.
010	2SA	009	003	And the king said, Is there yet a man left of the house of Saul, that I may act towards him with the mercy of God? and Siba said to the king, There is yet a son of Jonathan, lame [of] his feet.
010	2SA	009	004	And the king said, Where [is] he? and Siba said to the king, Behold, [he is] in the house of Machir the son of Amiel of Lodabar.
010	2SA	009	005	And king David went, and took him out of the house of Machir the son Amiel of Lodabar.
010	2SA	009	006	And Memphibosthe the son of Jonathan the son of Saul comes to the king David, and he fell upon his face and did obeisance to him: and David said to him, Memphibosthe: and he said, Behold thy servant.
010	2SA	009	007	And David said to him, Fear not, for I will surely deal mercifully with thee for the sake of Jonathan thy father, and I will restore to thee all the land of Saul the father of thy father; and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually.
010	2SA	009	008	And Memphibosthe did obeisance, and said, Who am I thy servant, that thou hast looked upon a dead dog like me?
010	2SA	009	009	And the king called Siba the servant of Saul, and said to him, All that belonged to Saul and to all his house have I given to the son of thy lord.
010	2SA	009	010	And thou, and thy sons, and thy servants, shall till the land for him; and thou shalt bring in bread to the son of thy lord, and he shall eat bread: and Memphibosthe the son of thy lord shall eat bread continually at my table. Now Siba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.
010	2SA	009	011	And Siba said to the king, According to all that my lord the king has commanded his servant, so will thy servant do. And Memphibosthe did eat at the table of David, as one of the sons of the king.
010	2SA	009	012	And Memphibosthe had a little son, and his name [was] Micha: and all the household of Siba [were] servants to Memphibosthe.
010	2SA	009	013	And Memphibosthe dwelt in Jerusalem, for he continually ate at the table of the king; and he was lame in both his feet.
010	2SA	010	001	And it came to pass after this that the king of the children of Ammon died, and Annon his son reigned in his stead.
010	2SA	010	002	And David said, I will shew mercy to Annon the son of Naas, as his father dealt mercifully with me. And David sent to comfort him concerning his father by the hand of his servants; and the servants of David came into the land of the children of Ammon.
010	2SA	010	003	And the princes of the children of Ammon said to Annon their lord, [Is it] to honour thy father before thee that David has sent comforters to thee? Has not David rather sent his servants to thee that they should search the city, and spy it out and examine it?
010	2SA	010	004	And Annon took the servants of David, and shaved their beards, and cut off their garments in the midst as far as their haunches, and sent them away.
010	2SA	010	005	And they brought David word concerning the men; and he sent to meet them, for the men were greatly dishonoured: and the king said, Remain in Jericho till your beards have grown, and [then] ye shall return.
010	2SA	010	006	And the children of Ammon saw that the people of David were ashamed; and the children of Ammon sent, and hired the Syrians of Baethraam, and the Syrians of Suba, and Roob, twenty thousand footmen, and the king of Amalec with a thousand men, and Istob with twelve thousand men.
010	2SA	010	007	And David heard, and sent Joab and all his host, [even] the mighty men.
010	2SA	010	008	And the children of Ammon went forth, and set the battle in array by the door of the gate: [those] of Syria, Suba, and Roob, and Istob, and Amalec, being by themselves in the field.
010	2SA	010	009	And Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him from that which was opposed in front and from behind, and he chose out [some] of all the young men of Israel, and they set themselves in array against Syria.
010	2SA	010	010	And the rest of the people he gave into the hand of Abessa his brother, and they set the battle in array opposite to the children of Ammon.
010	2SA	010	011	And he said, If Syria be too strong for me, then shall ye help me: and if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then will we be ready to help thee.
010	2SA	010	012	Be thou courageous, and let us be strong for our people, and for the sake of the cities of our God, and the Lord shall do that which is good in his eyes.
010	2SA	010	013	And Joab and his people with him advanced to battle against Syria, and they fled from before him.
010	2SA	010	014	And the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, and they fled from before Abessa, and entered into the city: and Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem.
010	2SA	010	015	And the Syrians saw that they were worsted before Israel, and they gathered themselves together.
010	2SA	010	016	And Adraazar sent and gathered the Syrians from the other side of the river Chalamak, and they came to Aelam; and Sobac the captain of the host of Adraazar [was] at their head.
010	2SA	010	017	And it was reported to David, and he gathered all Israel, and went over Jordan, and came to Aelam: and the Syrians set the battle in array against David, and fought with him.
010	2SA	010	018	And Syria fled from before Israel, and David destroyed of Syria seven hundred chariots, and forty thousand horsemen, and he smote Sobac the captain of his host, and he died there.
010	2SA	010	019	And all the kings the servants of Adraazar saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, and they went over to Israel, and served them: and Syria was afraid to help the children of Ammon any more.
010	2SA	011	001	And it came to pass when the time o the year for kings going out [to battle] had come round, that David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbath: but David remained at Jerusalem.
010	2SA	011	002	And it came to pass toward evening, that David arose off his couch, and walked on the roof of the king's house, and saw from the roof a woman bathing; and the woman was very beautiful to look upon.
010	2SA	011	003	And David sent and enquired about the woman: and [one] said, [Is] not this Bersabee the daughter of Eliab, the wife of Urias the Chettite?
010	2SA	011	004	And David sent messengers, and took her, and went in to her, and he lay with her: and she was purified from her uncleanness, and returned to her house.
010	2SA	011	005	And the woman conceived; and she sent and told David, and said, I am with child.
010	2SA	011	006	And David sent to Joab, saying, Send me Urias the Chettite; and Joab sent Urias to David.
010	2SA	011	007	And Urias arrived and went in to him, and David asked him how Joab was, and how the people were, and how the war went on.
010	2SA	011	008	And David said to Urias, Go to thy house, and wash thy feet: and Urias departed from the house of the king, and a portion [of meat] from the king followed him.
010	2SA	011	009	And Urias slept at the door of the king with the servants of his lord, and went not down to his house.
010	2SA	011	010	And they brought David word, saying, Urias has not gone down to his house. And David said to Urias, Art thou not come from a journey? why hast thou not gone down to thy house?
010	2SA	011	011	And Urias said to David, The ark, and Israel, and Juda dwell in tents; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open fields; and shall I go into my house to eat and drink, and lie with my wife? how [should I do this? as] thy soul lives, I will not do this thing.
010	2SA	011	012	And David said to Urias, Remain here to-day also, and to-morrow I will let thee go. So Urias remained in Jerusalem that day and the day following.
010	2SA	011	013	And David called him, and he ate before him and drank, and he made him drunk: and he went out in the evening to lie upon his bed with the servants of his lord, and went not down to his house.
010	2SA	011	014	And the morning came, and David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Urias.
010	2SA	011	015	And he wrote in the letter, saying, Station Urias in front of the severe [part] of the fight, and retreat from behind him, so shall he be wounded and die.
010	2SA	011	016	And it came to pass while Joab was watching against the city, that he set Urias in a place where he knew that valiant men were.
010	2SA	011	017	And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and some of the people of the servants of David fell, and Urias the Chettite died also.
010	2SA	011	018	And Joab sent, and reported to David all the events of the war, so as to tell them to the king.
010	2SA	011	019	And he charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast finished reporting all the events of the war to the king,
010	2SA	011	020	then it shall come to pass if the anger of the king shall arise, and he shall say to thee, Why did ye draw nigh to the city to fight? knew ye not that they would shoot from off the wall?
010	2SA	011	021	Who smote Abimelech the son of Jerobaal son of Ner? did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him from above the wall, and he died in Thamasi? why did ye draw near to the wall? then thou shalt say, Thy servant Urias the Chettite is also dead.
010	2SA	011	022	And the messenger of Joab went to the king to Jerusalem, and he came and reported to David all that Joab told him, all the affairs of the war. And David was very angry with Joab, and said to the messenger, Why did ye draw nigh to the wall to fight? knew ye not that ye would be wounded from off the wall? Who smote Abimelech the son of Jerobaal? did not a woman cast upon him a piece of millstone from the wall, and he died in Thamasi? why did ye draw near to the wall?
010	2SA	011	023	And the messenger said to David, The men prevailed against us, and they came out against us into the field, and we came upon them even to the door of the gate.
010	2SA	011	024	And the archers shot at thy servants from off the wall, and some of the king's servants died, and thy servant Urias the Chettite is dead also.
010	2SA	011	025	And David said to the messenger, Thus shalt thou say to Joab, Let not the matter be grievous in thine eyes, for the sword devours one way at one time and another way at another: strengthen thine array against the city, and destroy it, and strengthen him.
010	2SA	011	026	And the wife of Urias heard that Urias her husband was dead, and she mourned for her husband.
010	2SA	011	027	And the time of mourning expired, and David sent and took her into his house, and she became his wife, and bore him a son: but the thing which David did was evil in the eyes of the Lord.
010	2SA	012	001	And the Lord sent Nathan the prophet to David; and he went in to him, and said to him, There were two men in one city, one rich and the other poor.
010	2SA	012	002	And the rich [man] had very many flocks and herds.
010	2SA	012	003	But the poor [man had] only one little ewe lamb, which he had purchased, and preserved, and reared; an it grew up with himself and his children in common; it ate of his bread and drank of his cup, and slept in his bosom, and was to him as a daughter.
010	2SA	012	004	And a traveller came to the rich man, and he spared to take of his flocks and of his herds, to dress for the traveller that came to him; and he took the poor man's lamb, and dressed it for the man that came to him.
010	2SA	012	005	And David was greatly moved with anger against the man; and David said to Nathan, [As] the Lord lives, the man that did this thing shall surely die.
010	2SA	012	006	And he shall restore the lamb seven-fold, because he has not spared.
010	2SA	012	007	And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man that has done this. Thus says the Lord God of Israel, I anointed thee to be king over Israel, and I rescued thee out the hand of Saul;
010	2SA	012	008	and I gave thee the house of thy lord, and the wives of thy lord into thy bosom, and I gave to thee the house of Israel and Juda; and if that had been little, I would have given thee yet more.
010	2SA	012	009	Why hast thou set at nought the word of the Lord, to do that which is evil in his eyes? thou hast slain Urias the Chettite with the sword, and thou hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and thou hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.
010	2SA	012	010	Now therefore the sword shall not depart from thy house for ever, because thou has set me at nought, and thou hast taken the wife of Urias the Chettite, to be thy wife.
010	2SA	012	011	Thus says the Lord, Behold, I will raise up against thee evil out of thy house, and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and will give them to thy neighbour, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun.
010	2SA	012	012	For thou didst it secretly, but I will do this thing in the sight of all Israel, and before the sun.
010	2SA	012	013	And David said to Nathan, I have sinned against the Lord. And Nathan said to David, And the Lord has put away thy sin; thou shalt not die.
010	2SA	012	014	Only because thou hast given great occasion of provocation to the enemies of the Lord by this thing, thy son also that is born to thee shall surely die.
010	2SA	012	015	And Nathan departed to his house. And the Lord smote the child, which the wife of Urias the Chettite bore to David, and it was ill.
010	2SA	012	016	And David enquired of God concerning the child, and David fasted, and went in and lay all night upon the ground.
010	2SA	012	017	And the elders of his house arose [and went] to him to raise him up from the ground, but he would not [rise], nor did he eat bread with them.
010	2SA	012	018	And it came to pass on the seventh day that the child died: and the servants of David were afraid to tell him that the child was dead; for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive we spoke to him, and he hearkened not to our voice; and thou should we tell him that the child is dead?—so would he do [himself] harm.
010	2SA	012	019	And David understood that his servants were whispering, and David perceived that the child was dead: and David said to his servants, Is the child dead? and they said, He is dead.
010	2SA	012	020	Then David rose up from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his raiment, and went into the house of God, and worshipped him; and went into his own house, and called for bread to eat, and they set bread before him and he ate.
010	2SA	012	021	And his servants said to him, What [is] this thing that thou hast done concerning the child? while it was yet living thou didst fast, and weep, and watch: and when the child was dead thou didst rise up, and didst eat bread, and drink.
010	2SA	012	022	And David said, While the child yet lived, I fasted and wept; for I said, Who knows if the Lord will pity me, and the child live?
010	2SA	012	023	But now it is dead, why should I fast thus? shall I be able to bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.
010	2SA	012	024	And David comforted Bersabee his wife, and he went in to her, and lay with her; and she conceived and bore a son, and he called his named Solomon, and the Lord loved him.
010	2SA	012	025	And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet, and called his name Jeddedi, for the Lord's sake.
010	2SA	012	026	And Joab fought against Rabbath of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city.
010	2SA	012	027	And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbath, and taken the city of waters.
010	2SA	012	028	And now gather the rest of the people, and encamp against the city, an take it beforehand; lest I take the city first, and my name be called upon it.
010	2SA	012	029	And David gathered all the people, and went to Rabbath, and fought against it, and took it.
010	2SA	012	030	And he took the crown of Molchom their king from off his head, and the weight of it was a talent of gold, with precious stones, and it was upon the head of David; and he carried forth very much spoil of the city.
010	2SA	012	031	And he brought forth the people that were in it, and put them under the saw, and under iron harrows, and axes of iron, and made them pass through the brick-kiln: and thus he did to all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.
010	2SA	013	001	And it happened after this that Abessalom the son of David had a very beautiful sister, and her name [was] Themar; and Amnon the son of David loved her.
010	2SA	013	002	And Amnon was distressed even to sickness, because of Themar his sister; for she was a virgin, and it seemed very difficult for Amnon to do anything to her.
010	2SA	013	003	And Amnon had a friend, and his name [was] Jonadab, the son of Samaa the brother of David: and Jonadab [was] a very cunning man.
010	2SA	013	004	And he said to him, What ails thee that thou art thus weak? O son of the king, morning by morning? wilt thou not tell me? and Ammon said, I love Themar the sister of my brother Abessalom.
010	2SA	013	005	And Jonadab said to him, Lie upon thy bed, and make thyself sick, and thy father shall come in to see thee; and thou shalt say to him, Let, I pray thee, Themar my sister come, and feed me with morsels, and let her prepare food before my eyes, that I may see and eat at her hands.
010	2SA	013	006	So Ammon lay down, and made himself sick; and the king came in to see him: and Amnon said to the king, Let, I pray thee, my sister Themar come to me, and make a couple of cakes in my sight, and I will eat them at her hand.
010	2SA	013	007	And David sent to Themar to the house, saying, Go now to thy brother's house, and dress him food.
010	2SA	013	008	And Themar went to the house of her brother Amnon, and he [was] lying down: and she took the dough and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and baked the cakes.
010	2SA	013	009	And she took the frying pan and poured them out before him, but he would not eat. And Amnon said, Send out every man from about me. And they removed every man from about him.
010	2SA	013	010	And Amnon said to Themar, Bring in the food into the closet, and I will eat of thy hand. And Themar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them to her brother Amnon into the chamber.
010	2SA	013	011	And she brought [them] to him to eat, and he caught hold of her, and said to her, Come, lie with me, my sister.
010	2SA	013	012	And she said to him, Nay, my brother, do not humble me, for it ought not to be so done in Israel; do not this folly.
010	2SA	013	013	And I, whither shall I remove my reproach? and thou shalt be as one of the fools in Israel. And now, speak, I pray thee, to the king, for surely he will not keep me from thee.
010	2SA	013	014	But Amnon would not hearken to her voice; and he prevailed against her, and humbled her, and lay with her.
010	2SA	013	015	Then Amnon hated her with very great hatred; for the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her, for the last wickedness was greater than the first: and Amnon said to her, Rise, and be gone.
010	2SA	013	016	And Themar spoke to him concerning this great mischief, greater, [said she], than the other that thou didst me, to send me away: but Amnon would not hearken to her voice.
010	2SA	013	017	And he called his servant who had charge of the house, and said to him, Put now this [woman] out from me, and shut the door after her.
010	2SA	013	018	And she had on her a variegated robe, for so were the king's daughters that were virgins attired in their apparel: and his servant led her forth, and shut the door after her.
010	2SA	013	019	And Themar took ashes, and put them on her head; and she rent the variegated garment that was upon her: and she laid her hands on her head, and went crying continually.
010	2SA	013	020	And Abessalom her brother said to her, Has thy brother Amnon been with thee? now then, my sister, be silent, for he is thy brother: be not careful to mention this matter. So Themar dwelt as a widow in the house of her brother Abessalom.
010	2SA	013	021	And king David heard of all these things, and was very angry; but he did not grieve the spirit of his son Amnon, because be loved him, for he was his first-born.
010	2SA	013	022	And Abessalom spoke not to Amnon, good or bad, because Abessalom hated Amnon, on account of his humbling his sister Themar.
010	2SA	013	023	And it came to pass at the end of two whole years, that they were shearing [sheep] for Abessalom in Belasor near Ephraim: and Abessalom invited all the king's sons.
010	2SA	013	024	And Abessalom came to the king, and said, Behold, thy servant has a sheep-shearing; let now the king and his servants go with thy servant.
010	2SA	013	025	And the king said to Abessalom, Nay, my son, let us not all go, and let us not be burdensome to thee. And he pressed him; but he would not go, but blessed him.
010	2SA	013	026	And Abessalom said to him, And if not, let I pray thee, my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said to him, Why should he go with thee?
010	2SA	013	027	And Abessalom pressed him, and he sent with him Amnon and all the king's sons; and Abessalom made a banquet like the banquet of the king.
010	2SA	013	028	And Abessalom charged his servants, saying, Mark when the heart of Amnon shall be merry with wine, and I shall say to you, Smite Amnon, and slay him: fear not; for is it not I that command you? Be courageous, and be valiant.
010	2SA	013	029	And the servants of Abessalom did to Amnon as Abessalom commanded them: and all the sons of the king rose up, and they mounted every man his mule, and fled.
010	2SA	013	030	And it came to pass, when they were in the way, that a report came to David, saying, Abessalom has slain all the king's sons, and there is not one of them left.
010	2SA	013	031	Then the king arose, and rent his garments, and lay upon the ground: and all his servants that were standing round him rent their garments.
010	2SA	013	032	And Jonadab the son of Samaa brother of David, answered and said, Let not my Lord the king say that he has slain all the young men the sons of the king, for Amnon only of them all is dead; for he was appointed [to death] by the mouth of Abessalom from the day that he humbled his sister Themar.
010	2SA	013	033	And now let not my lord the king take the matter to heart, saying, All the king's sons are dead: for Amnon only of them is dead.
010	2SA	013	034	And Abessalom escaped: and the young man the watchman, lifted up his eyes, and looked; and, behold, much people went in the way behind him from the side of the mountain in the descent: and the watchman came and told the king, and said, I have seen men by the way of Oronen, by the side of the mountain.
010	2SA	013	035	And Jonadab said to the king, Behold, the king's sons are present: according to the word of thy servant, so has it happened.
010	2SA	013	036	And it came to pass when he had finished speaking, that, behold, the king's sons came, and lifted up their voices and wept: and the king also and all his servants wept with a very great weeping.
010	2SA	013	037	But Abessalom fled, and went to Tholmi son of Emiud the king of Gedsur to the land of Chamaachad: and king David mourned for his son continually.
010	2SA	013	038	So Abessalom fled, and departed to Gedsur, and was there three years.
010	2SA	013	039	And king David ceased to go out after Abessalom, for he was comforted concerning Amnon, touching his death.
010	2SA	014	001	And Joab the son of Saruia knew that the heart of the king was toward Abessalom.
010	2SA	014	002	And Joab sent to Thecoe, and took thence a cunning woman, and said to her, Mourn, I pray thee, and put on mourning apparel, and anoint thee not with oil, and thou shalt be as a woman mourning for one that is dead thus for many days.
010	2SA	014	003	And thou shalt go to the king, and speak to him according to this word. And Joab put the words in her mouth.
010	2SA	014	004	So the woman of Thecoe went in to the king and fell upon her face to the earth, and did him obeisance, and said, Help, O king, help.
010	2SA	014	005	And the king said to her, What is the matter with thee? And she said, I am indeed a widow woman, and my husband is dead.
010	2SA	014	006	And moreover thy handmaid had two sons, and they fought together in the field, and there was no one to part them; and the one smote the other his brother, and slew him.
010	2SA	014	007	And behold the whole family rose up against thine handmaid, and they said, Give up the one that smote his brother, and we will put him to death for the life of his brother, whom he slew, and we will take away even your heir: so they will quench my coal that is left, so as not to leave my husband remnant or name on the face of the earth.
010	2SA	014	008	And the king said to the woman, Go in peace to thy house, and I will give commandment concerning thee.
010	2SA	014	009	And the woman of Thecoe said to the king, On me, my lord, O king, and on my father's house [be] the iniquity, and the king and his throne [be] guiltless.
010	2SA	014	010	And the king said, Who was it that spoke to thee? thou shalt even bring him to me, and [one] shall not touch him any more.
010	2SA	014	011	And she said, Let now the king remember concerning his Lord God in that the avenger of blood is multiplied to destroy, and let them not take away my son. And he said, [As] the lord lives, not a hair of thy son shall fall to the ground.
010	2SA	014	012	And the woman said, Let now thy servant speak a word to my lord the king. And he said, Say on.
010	2SA	014	013	And the woman said, Why hast thou devised this thing against the people of God? or [is] this word out of the king's mouth as a transgression, so that the king should not bring back his banished?
010	2SA	014	014	For we shall surely die, and be as water poured upon the earth, which shall not be gathered up, and God shall take the life, even as he devises to thrust forth from him his outcast.
010	2SA	014	015	And now whereas I came to speak this word to my lord the king, [the reason is] that the people will see me, and thy handmaid will say, Let one now speak to my lord the king, if peradventure the king will perform the request of his handmaid;
010	2SA	014	016	for the king will hear. Let him rescue his handmaid out of the hand of the man that seeks to cast out me and my son from the inheritance of God.
010	2SA	014	017	And the woman said, If now the word of my lord the king be gracious, —[well]: for as an angel of God, so [is] my lord the king, to hear good and evil: and the Lord thy God shall be with thee.
010	2SA	014	018	And the king answered, and said to the woman, Hide not from me, I pray thee, the matter which I ask thee. And the woman said, Let my lord the king by all means speak.
010	2SA	014	019	And the king said, [Is] not the hand of Joab in all this matter with thee? and the woman said to the king, [As] thy soul lives, my lord, O king, there is no turning to the right hand or to the left from all that my lord the king has spoken; for thy servant Joab himself charged me, and he put all these words in the mouth of thine handmaid.
010	2SA	014	020	In order that this form of speech might come about [it was] that thy servant Joab has framed this matter: and my lord is wise as [is] the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth.
010	2SA	014	021	And the king said to Joab, Behold now, I have done to thee according to this thy word: go, bring back the young man Abessalom.
010	2SA	014	022	And Joab fell on his face to the ground, and did obeisance, and blessed the king: and Joab said, To-day thy servant knows that I have found grace in thy sight, my lord, O king, for my lord the king has performed the request of his servant.
010	2SA	014	023	And Joab arose, and went to Gedsur, and brought Abessalom to Jerusalem.
010	2SA	014	024	And the king said, Let him return to his house, and not see my face. And Abessalom returned to his house, and saw not the king's face.
010	2SA	014	025	And there was not a man in Israel so very comely as Abessalom: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.
010	2SA	014	026	And when he polled his head, (and it was at the beginning of every year that he polled it, because it grew, heavy upon him,) even when he polled it, he weighed the hair of his head, two hundred shekels according to the royal shekel.
010	2SA	014	027	And there were born to Abessalom three sons and one daughter, and her name was Themar: she was a very beautiful woman, and she becomes the wife of Roboam son of Solomon, and she bears to him Abia.
010	2SA	014	028	And Abessalom remained in Jerusalem two full years, and he saw not the king's face.
010	2SA	014	029	And Abessalom sent to Joab to bring him in to the king, and he would not come to him: and he sent to him the second time, and he would not come.
010	2SA	014	030	And Abessalom said to his servants, Behold, Joab's portion in the field [is] next to mine, and he has in it barley; go and set it on fire. And the servants of Abessalom set the field on fire: and the servants of Joab come to him with their clothes rent, and they said to him, The servants of Abessalom have set the field on fire.
010	2SA	014	031	And Joab arose, and came to Abessalom into the house, and said to him, Why have thy servants set my field on fire?
010	2SA	014	032	And Abessalom said to Joab, Behold, I sent to thee, saying, Come hither, and I will send thee to the king, saying, Why did I come out of Gedsur? it would have been better for me to have remained there: and now, behold, I have not seen the face of the king; but if there is iniquity in me, then put me to death.
010	2SA	014	033	And Joab went in to the king, and brought him word: and he called Abessalom, and he went in to the king, and did him obeisance, and fell upon his face to the ground, even in the presence of the king; and the king kissed Abessalom.
010	2SA	015	001	And it came to pass after this that Abessalom prepared for himself chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.
010	2SA	015	002	And Abessalom rose early, and stood by the side of the way of the gate: and it came to pass that every man who had a cause, came to the king for judgment, and Abessalom cried to him, and said to him, Of what city art thou? And he said, Thy servant [is] of one of the tribes of Israel.
010	2SA	015	003	And Abessalom said to him, See, thy affairs [are] right and clear, yet thou hast no one [appointed] of the king to hear thee.
010	2SA	015	004	And Abessalom said, O that one would make me a judge in the land; then every man who had a dispute or a cause would come to me, and I would judge him!
010	2SA	015	005	And it came to pass when a man came near to do him obeisance, that he stretched out his hand, and took hold of him, and kissed him.
010	2SA	015	006	And Abessalom did after this manner to all Israel that came to the king for judgment; and Abessalom gained the hearts of the men of Israel.
010	2SA	015	007	And it came to pass after forty years, that Abessalom said to his father, I will go now, and pay my vows, which I vowed to the Lord in Chebron.
010	2SA	015	008	For thy servant vowed a vow when I dwelt at Gedsur in Syria, saying, If the Lord should indeed restore me to Jerusalem, then will I serve the Lord.
010	2SA	015	009	And the king said to him, Go in peace. And he arose and went to Chebron.
010	2SA	015	010	And Abessalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, When ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then shall ye say, Abessalom is become king in Chebron.
010	2SA	015	011	And there went with Abessalom two hundred chosen men from Jerusalem; and they went in their simplicity, and knew not anything.
010	2SA	015	012	And Abessalom sent to Achitophel the Theconite, the counsellor of David, from his city, from Gola, where he was sacrificing: and there was a strong conspiracy; and the people with Abessalom were increasingly numerous.
010	2SA	015	013	And there came a messenger to David, saying, the heart of the men of Israel is gone after Abessalom.
010	2SA	015	014	And David said to all his servants who were with him in Jerusalem, Rise, and let us flee, for we have no refuge from Abessalom: make haste and go, lest he overtake us speedily, and bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.
010	2SA	015	015	And the king's servants said to the king, In all things which our lord the king chooses, behold [we are] thy servants.
010	2SA	015	016	And the king and all his house went out on foot: and the king left ten women of his concubines to keep the house.
010	2SA	015	017	And the king and all his servants went out on foot; and abode in a distant house.
010	2SA	015	018	And all his servants passed on by his side, and every Chelethite, and every Phelethite, and they stood by the olive tree in the wilderness: and all the people marched near him, and all his court, and all the men of might, and all the men of war, six hundred: and they were present at his side: and every Chelethite, and every Phelethite, and all the six hundred Gittites that came on foot out of Geth, and they went on before the king.
010	2SA	015	019	And the king said to Ethi, the Gittite, Why dost thou also go with us? return, and dwell with the king, for thou art a stranger, and thou has come forth as a sojourner out of thy place.
010	2SA	015	020	Whereas thou camest yesterday, shall I to-day cause thee to travel with us, and shalt thou [thus] change thy place? thou didst come forth yesterday, and to-day shall I set thee in motion to go along with us? I indeed will go whithersoever I may go: return then, and cause thy brethren to return with thee, and may the Lord deal mercifully and truly with thee.
010	2SA	015	021	And Ethi answered the king and said, [As] the Lord lives and as my lord the king lives, in the place wheresoever my lord shall be, whether it be for death or life, there shall thy servant be.
010	2SA	015	022	And the king said to Ethi, Come and pass over with me. So Ethi the Gittite and the king passed over, and all his servants, and all the multitude with him.
010	2SA	015	023	And all the country wept with a loud voice. And all the people passed by over the brook of Kedron; and the king crossed the brook Kedron: and all the people and the king passed on toward the way of the wilderness.
010	2SA	015	024	And behold also Sadoc, and all the Levites were with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of the Lord from Baethar: and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had passed out of the city.
010	2SA	015	025	And the king said to Sadoc, Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I should find favour in the eyes of the Lord, then will he bring me back, and he will shew me it and its beauty.
010	2SA	015	026	But if he should say thus, I have no pleasure in thee; behold, [here] I am, let him do to me according to that which is good in his eyes.
010	2SA	015	027	And the king said to Sadoc the priest, Behold, thou shalt return to the city in peace, and Achimaas thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar, your two sons with you.
010	2SA	015	028	Behold, I continue in arms in Araboth of the desert, until there come tidings from you to report to me.
010	2SA	015	029	So Sadoc and Abiathar brought back the ark of the Lord to Jerusalem, and it continued there.
010	2SA	015	030	And David went up by the ascent of [the mount of] Olives, ascending and weeping, and had his head covered, and went barefooted: and all the people that were with him covered [every] man his head; and they went up, ascending and weeping.
010	2SA	015	031	And it was reported to David, saying, Achitophel also [is] among the conspirators with Abessalom. And David said, O Lord my God, disconcert, I pray thee, the counsel of Achitophel.
010	2SA	015	032	And David came as far as Ros, where he worshipped God: and behold, Chusi the chief friend of David came out to meet him, having rent his garment, and earth [was] upon his head.
010	2SA	015	033	And David said to him, If thou shouldest go over with me, then wilt thou be a burden to me;
010	2SA	015	034	but if thou shall return to the city, and shalt say to Abessalom, Thy brethren are passed over, and the king thy father is passed over after me: and now I am thy servant, O king, suffer me to live: at one time even of late I was the servant of thy father, and now I [am] thy humble servant—so shalt thou disconcert for me, the counsel of Achitophel.
010	2SA	015	035	And, behold, [there are] there with thee Sadoc and Abiathar the priests; and it shall be that every word that thou shalt hear of the house of the king, thou shalt report it to Sadoc and Abiathar the priests.
010	2SA	015	036	Behold, [there are] there with them their two sons, Achimaas the son of Sadoc, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar; and by them ye shall report to me every word which ye shall hear.
010	2SA	015	037	So Chusi the friend of David went into the city, and Abessalom was lately gone into Jerusalem.
010	2SA	016	001	And David passed on a little way from Ros; and, behold, Siba the servant of Memphibosthe [came] to meet him; and he had a couple of asses laden, and upon them two hundred loaves, and a hundred [bunches of] raisins, and a hundred [cakes of] dates, and bottle of wine.
010	2SA	016	002	And the king said to Siba, What meanest thou by these? and Siba, said, The asses [are] for the household of the king to sit upon, and the loaves and the dates [are] for the young men to eat, and the wine [is] for them that are faint in the wilderness to drink.
010	2SA	016	003	And the king said, And where [is] the son of thy master? and Siba said to the king, Behold, he remains in Jerusalem; for he said, To-day shall the house of Israel restore to me the kingdom of my father.
010	2SA	016	004	And the king said to Siba, Behold, all Memphibosthe's property [is] thine. And Siba did obeisance and said, My lord, O king, let me find grace in thine eyes.
010	2SA	016	005	And king David came to Baurim; and, behold, there came out from thence a man of the family of the house of Saul, and his name [was] Semei the son of Gera. He came forth and cursed as he went,
010	2SA	016	006	and cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on the right and left hand of the king.
010	2SA	016	007	And thus Semei said when he cursed him, Go out, go out, thou bloody man, and man of sin.
010	2SA	016	008	The Lord has returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, because thou hast reigned in his stead; and the Lord has given the kingdom into the hand of Abessalom thy son: and, behold, thou [art taken] in thy mischief, because thou [art] a bloody man.
010	2SA	016	009	And Abessa the son of Saruia said to the king, Why does this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over now and take off his head.
010	2SA	016	010	And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Saruia? even let him alone, and so let him curse, for the Lord has told him to curse David: and who shall say, Why hast thou done thus?
010	2SA	016	011	And David said to Abessa and to all his servants, Behold, my son who came forth out of my bowels seeks my life; still more now may the son of Benjamin: let him curse, because the Lord has told him.
010	2SA	016	012	If by any means the Lord may look on my affliction, thus shall he return me good for his cursing this day.
010	2SA	016	013	And David and all the men with him went on the way: and Semei went by the side of the hill next to him, cursing as he went, and casting stones at him, and sprinkling him with dirt.
010	2SA	016	014	And the king, and all the people with him, came away and refreshed themselves there.
010	2SA	016	015	And Abessalom and all the men of Israel went into Jerusalem, and Achitophel with him.
010	2SA	016	016	And it came to pass when Chusi the chief friend of David came to Abessalom, that Chusi said to Abessalom, Let the king live.
010	2SA	016	017	And Abessalom said to Chusi, [Is] this thy kindness to thy friend? why wentest thou not forth with thy friend?
010	2SA	016	018	And Chusi said to Abessalom, Nay, but following whom the Lord, and this people, and all Israel have chosen, —his will I be, and with him I will dwell.
010	2SA	016	019	And again, whom shall I serve? should I not in the presence of his son? As I served in the sight of thy father, so will I be in thy presence.
010	2SA	016	020	And Abessalom said to Achitophel, Deliberate among yourselves concerning what we should do.
010	2SA	016	021	And Achitophel said to Abessalom, Go in to thy father's concubines, whom he left to keep his house; and all Israel shall hear that thou hast dishonoured thy father; and the hands of all that are with thee shall be strengthened.
010	2SA	016	022	And they pitched a tent for Abessalom on the roof, and Abessalom went in to his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.
010	2SA	016	023	And the counsel of Achitophel, which he counselled in former days, [was] as if one should enquire of the word of God: so [was] all the counsel of Achitophel both to David and also to Abessalom.
010	2SA	017	001	And Achitophel said to Abessalom, Let me now choose out for myself twelve thousand men, and I will arise and follow after David this night:
010	2SA	017	002	and I will come upon him when he [is] weary and weak-handed, and I will strike him with terror; and all the people with him shall flee, and I will smite the king only of all.
010	2SA	017	003	And I will bring back all the people to thee, as a bride returns to her husband: only thou seekest the life of one man, and all the people shall have peace.
010	2SA	017	004	And the saying [was] right in the eyes of Abessalom, and in the eyes of all the elders of Israel.
010	2SA	017	005	And Abessalom said, Call now also Chusi the Arachite, and let us hear what [is] in his mouth, even in his also.
010	2SA	017	006	And Chusi went in to Abessalom, and Abessalom spoke to him, saying, After this manner spoke Achitophel: shall we do according to his word? but if not, do thou speak.
010	2SA	017	007	And Chusi said to Abessalom, This counsel which Achitophel has counselled this one time [is] not good.
010	2SA	017	008	And Chusi said, Thou knowest thy father and his men, that they are very mighty, and bitter in their spirit, as a bereaved bear in the field, [and as a wild boar in the plain]: and thy father [is] a man of war, and will not give the people rest.
010	2SA	017	009	For, behold, he is now hidden in one of the hills or in some [other] place: and it shall come to pass when he falls upon them at the beginning, that [some one] will certainly hear, and say, There has been a slaughter among the people that follow after Abessalom.
010	2SA	017	010	Then even he [that is] strong, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, —it shall utterly melt: for all Israel knows that thy father [is] mighty, and they that are with him [are] mighty men.
010	2SA	017	011	For thus I have surely given counsel, that all Israel be generally gathered to thee from Dan even to Bersabee, as the sand that is upon the sea-shore for multitude: and that thy presence go in the midst of them.
010	2SA	017	012	And we will come upon him in one of the places where we shall find him, and we will encamp against him, as the dew falls upon the earth; and we will not leave of him and of his men so much as one.
010	2SA	017	013	And if he shall have taken refuge with his army in a city, then shall all Israel take ropes to that city, and we will draw it even into the river, that there may not be left there even a stone.
010	2SA	017	014	And Abessalom, and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Chusi the Arachite [is] better than the counsel of Achitophel. For the Lord ordained to disconcert the good counsel of Achitophel, that the Lord might bring all evil upon Abessalom.
010	2SA	017	015	And Chusi the Arachite said to Sadoc and Abiathar the priests, Thus and thus Achitophel counselled Abessalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and thus have I counselled.
010	2SA	017	016	And now send quickly and report to David, saying, Lodge not this night in Araboth of the wilderness: even go and make haste, lest [one] swallow up the king, and all the people with him.
010	2SA	017	017	And Jonathan and Achimaas stood by the well of Rogel, and a maid-servant went and reported to them, and they go and tell king David; for they might not be seen to enter into the city.
010	2SA	017	018	But a young man saw them and told Abessalom: and the two went quickly, and entered into the house of a man in Baurim; and he had a well in his court, and they went down into it.
010	2SA	017	019	And a woman took a covering, and spread it over the mouth of the well, and spread out ground corn upon it to dry, and the thing was not known.
010	2SA	017	020	And the servants of Abessalom came to the woman into the house, and said, Where [are] Achimaas and Jonathan? and the woman said to them, They are gone a little way beyond the water. And they sought and found them not, and returned to Jerusalem.
010	2SA	017	021	And it came to pass after they were gone, that they came up out of the pit, and went on their way; and reported to king David, and said to David, Arise ye and go quickly over the water, for thus has Achitophel counselled concerning you.
010	2SA	017	022	And David rose up and all the people with him, and they passed over Jordan till the morning light; there was not one missing who did not pass over Jordan.
010	2SA	017	023	And Achitophel saw that his counsel was not followed, and he saddled his ass, and rose and departed to his house into his city; and he gave orders to his household, and hanged himself, and died, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father.
010	2SA	017	024	And David passed over to Manaim: and Abessalom crossed over Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.
010	2SA	017	025	And Abessalom appointed Amessai in the room of Joab over the host. And Amessai was the son of a man whose name was Jether of Jezrael: he went in to Abigaia the daughter of Naas, the sister of Saruia the mother of Joab.
010	2SA	017	026	And all Israel and Abessalom encamped in the land of Galaad.
010	2SA	017	027	And it came to pass when David came to Manaim, that Uesbi the son of Naas of Rabbath of the sons of Ammon, and Machir son of Amiel of Lodabar, and Berzelli the Galaadite of Rogellim,
010	2SA	017	028	brought ten embroidered beds, (with double coverings,) and ten caldrons, and earthenware, and wheat, and barley, and flour, and meal, and beans, and pulse,
010	2SA	017	029	and honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheeses of kine: and they brought them to David and to his people with him to eat; for [one] said, The people [is] faint and hungry and thirsty in the wilderness.
010	2SA	018	001	And David numbered the people with him, and set over them captains of thousands and captains of hundreds.
010	2SA	018	002	And David sent away the people, the third part under the hand of Joab, and the third part under the hand of Abessa the son of Saruia, the brother of Joab, and the third part under the hand of Ethi the Gittite. And David said to the people, I also will surely go out with you.
010	2SA	018	003	And they said, Thou shalt not go out: for if we should indeed flee, they will not care for us; and if half of us should die, they will not mind us; for thou [art] as ten thousand of us: and now [it is] well that thou shalt be to us an aid to help us in the city.
010	2SA	018	004	And the king said to them, Whatsoever shall seem good in your eyes I will do. And the king stood by the side of the gate, and all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands.
010	2SA	018	005	And the king commanded Joab and Abessa and Ethi, saying, Spare for my sake the young man Abessalom. And all the people heard the king charging all the commanders concerning Abessalom.
010	2SA	018	006	And all the people went out into the wood against Israel; and the battle was in the wood of Ephraim.
010	2SA	018	007	And the people of Israel fell down there before the servants of David, and there was a great slaughter in that day, [even] twenty thousand men.
010	2SA	018	008	And the battle there was scattered over the face of all the land: and the wood consumed more of the people than the sword consumed among the people in that day.
010	2SA	018	009	And Abessalom went to meet the servants of David: and Abessalom was mounted on his mule, and the mule came under the thick boughs of a great oak; and his head was entangled in the oak, and he was suspended between heaven and earth; and the mule passed on from under him.
010	2SA	018	010	And a man saw it, and reported to Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Abessalom hanging in an oak.
010	2SA	018	011	And Joab said to the man who reported it to him, And, behold, thou didst see him: why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and I would have given thee ten [pieces] of silver, and a girdle.
010	2SA	018	012	And the man said to Joab, Were I even to receive a thousand shekels of silver, I would not lift my hand against the king's son; for in our ears the king charged thee and Abessa and Ethi, saying, Take care of the young man Abessalom for me,
010	2SA	018	013	so as to do no harm to his life: and nothing of the matter will be concealed from the king, and thou wilt set thyself against me.
010	2SA	018	014	And Joab said, I will begin this; I will not thus remain with thee. And Joab took three darts in his hand, and thrust them into the heart of Abessalom, while he was yet alive in the heart of the oak.
010	2SA	018	015	And ten young men that bore Joab's armour compassed Abessalom, and smote him and slew him.
010	2SA	018	016	And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing Israel, for Joab spared the people.
010	2SA	018	017	And he took Abessalom, and cast him into a great cavern in the wood, into a deep pit, and set up over him a very great heap of stones: and all Israel fled every man to his tent.
010	2SA	018	018	Now Abessalom while yet alive had taken and set up for himself the pillar near which he was taken, and set it up so as to have the pillar in the king's dale; for he said he had no son to keep his name in remembrance: and he called the pillar, Abessalom's hand, until this day.
010	2SA	018	019	And Achimaas the son of Sadoc said, Let me run now and carry glad tidings to the king, for the Lord has delivered him from the hand of his enemies.
010	2SA	018	020	And Joab said to him, Thou [shalt] not [be] a messenger of glad tidings this day; thou shalt bear them another day; but on this day thou shalt bear no tidings, because the king's son is dead.
010	2SA	018	021	And Joab said to Chusi, Go, report to the king all that thou hast seen. And Chusi did obeisance to Joab, and went out.
010	2SA	018	022	And Achimaas the son of Sadoc said again to Joab, Nay, let me also run after Chusi. And Joab said, Why wouldest thou thus run, my son? attend, thou hast no tidings for profit if thou go.
010	2SA	018	023	And he said, Why should I not run? and Joab said to him, Run. And Achimaas ran along the way of Kechar, and outran Chusi.
010	2SA	018	024	And David was sitting between the two gates: and the watchman went up on the top of the gate of the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone before him.
010	2SA	018	025	And the watchman cried out, and reported to the king. And the king said, If he be alone, [there are] good tidings in his mouth. And the man came and drew near.
010	2SA	018	026	And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman cried at the gate, and said, And look, another man running alone. And the king said, He also brings glad tidings.
010	2SA	018	027	And the watchman said, I see the running of the first as the running of Achimaas the son of Sadoc. And the king said, He [is] a good man, and will come to [report] glad tidings.
010	2SA	018	028	And Achimaas cried out and said to the king, Peace. And he did obeisance to the king with his face to the ground, and said, Blessed [be] the Lord thy God, who has delivered up the men that lifted up their hands against my lord the king.
010	2SA	018	029	And the king said, [Is] the young man Abessalom safe? and Achimaas said, I saw a great multitude [at the time] of Joab's sending the king's servant and thy servant, and I knew not what was there.
010	2SA	018	030	And the king said, Turn aside, stand still here. And he turned aside, and stood.
010	2SA	018	031	And, behold, Chusi came up, and said to the king, Let my lord the king hear glad tidings, for the Lord has avenged thee this day upon all them that rose up against thee.
010	2SA	018	032	And the king said to Chusi, Is it well with the young man Abessalom? and Chusi said, Let the enemies of my lord the king, and all whosoever have risen up against him for evil, be as that young man.
010	2SA	018	033	And the king was troubled, and went to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and thus he said as he went, My son Abessalom, my son, my son Abessalom; would God I had died for thee, [even] I [had died] for thee, Abessalom, my son, my son!
010	2SA	019	001	And they brought Joab word, saying, Behold, the king weeps and mourns for Abessalom.
010	2SA	019	002	And the victory was turned that day into mourning to all the people, for the people heard say that day, The king grieves after his son.
010	2SA	019	003	And the people stole away that day to go into the city, as people steal away when they are ashamed as they flee in the battle.
010	2SA	019	004	And the king hid his face: and the king cried with a loud voice, My son Abessalom! Abessalom my son!
010	2SA	019	005	And Joab went in to the king, into the house, and said, Thou hast this day shamed the faces of all thy servants that have delivered thee this day, and [have saved] the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters, and the lives of thy wives, and of thy concubines,
010	2SA	019	006	forasmuch as thou lovest them that hate thee, and hatest them that love thee; and thou hast this day declared, that thy princes and thy servants are nothing [in thy sight]: for I know this day, that if Abessalom were alive, [and] all of us dead to-day, then it would have been right in thy sight.
010	2SA	019	007	And now arise, and go forth, and speak comfortably to thy servants; for I have sworn by the Lord, that unless thou wilt go forth to-day, there shall not a man remain with thee this night: and know for thyself, this thing [will] indeed [be] evil to thee beyond all the evil that has come upon thee from thy youth until now.
010	2SA	019	008	Then the king arose, and sat in the gate: and all the people reported, saying, Behold, the king sits in the gate. And all the people went in before the king to the gate; for Israel had fled every man to his tent.
010	2SA	019	009	And all the people disputed among all the tribes of Israel, saying, King David delivered us from all our enemies, and he rescued us from the hand of the Philistines: and now he has fled from the land, and from his kingdom, and from Abessalom.
010	2SA	019	010	And Abessalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle: and now why are ye silent about bringing back the king? And the word of all Israel came to the king.
010	2SA	019	011	And king David sent to Sadoc and Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak to the elders of Israel, saying, Why are ye the last to bring back the king to his house? whereas the word of all Israel is come to the king to his house.
010	2SA	019	012	Ye [are] my brethren, ye [are] my bones and my flesh: why are ye the last to bring back the king to his house?
010	2SA	019	013	And ye shall say to Amessai, [Art] thou not my bone and my flesh? and now God do so to me, and more also, if thou shalt not be commander of the host before me continually in the room of Joab.
010	2SA	019	014	And he bowed the heart of all the men of Juda as that of one man; and they sent to the king, saying, Return thou, and all thy servants.
010	2SA	019	015	And the king returned, and came as far as Jordan. And the men of Juda came to Galgala on their way to meet the king, to cause the king to pass over Jordan.
010	2SA	019	016	And Semei the son of Gera, the Benjamite, of Baurim, hasted and went down with the men of Juda to meet king David.
010	2SA	019	017	And a thousand men of Benjamin [were] with him, and Siba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons with him, and his twenty servants with him: and they went directly down to Jordan before the king,
010	2SA	019	018	and they performed the service of bringing the king over; and there went over a ferry-boat to remove the household of the king, and to do that which was right in his eyes. And Semei the son of Gera fell on his face before the king, as he went over Jordan;
010	2SA	019	019	and said to the king, Let not my lord now impute iniquity, and remember not all the iniquity of thy servant in the day in which my lord went out from Jerusalem, so that the king should mind it.
010	2SA	019	020	For thy servant knows that I have sinned: and, behold, I am come to-day before all Israel and the house of Joseph, to go down and meet my lord the king.
010	2SA	019	021	And Abessai the son of Saruia answered and said, Shall not Semei therefore be put to death, because he cursed the Lord's anointed?
010	2SA	019	022	And David said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Saruia, that ye as it were lie in wait against me this day? to-day no man in Israel shall be put to death, for I know not if I this day reign over Israel.
010	2SA	019	023	And the king said to Semei, Thou shalt not die: and the king swore to him.
010	2SA	019	024	And Memphibosthe the son of Saul's son went down to meet the king, and had not dressed his feet, nor pared his nails, nor shaved himself, neither had he washed his garments, from the day that the king departed, until the day when he arrived in peace.
010	2SA	019	025	And it came to pass when he went into Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said to him, Why didst thou not go with me, Memphibosthe?
010	2SA	019	026	And Memphibosthe said to him, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me; for thy servant said to him, Saddle me the ass, and I will ride upon it, and go with the king; for thy servant [is] lame.
010	2SA	019	027	And he has dealt deceitfully with thy servant to my lord the king: but my lord the king [is] as an angel of God, and do thou that which is good in thine eyes.
010	2SA	019	028	For all the house of my father were but as dead men before my lord the king; yet thou hast set thy servant among them that eat at thy table: and what right have I any longer even to cry to the king?
010	2SA	019	029	And the king said to him, Why speakest thou any longer of thy matters? I have said, Thou and Siba shall divide the land.
010	2SA	019	030	And Memphibosthe said to the king, Yea, let him take all, since my lord the king has come in peace to his house.
010	2SA	019	031	And Berzelli the Galaadite came down from Rogellim, and crossed over Jordan with the king, that he might conduct the king over Jordan.
010	2SA	019	032	And Berzelli was a very old man, eighty years old; and he had maintained the king when he dwelt in Manaim; for he was a very great man.
010	2SA	019	033	And the king said to Berzelli, Thou shalt go over with me, and I will nourish thine old age with me in Jerusalem.
010	2SA	019	034	And Berzelli said to the king, How many [are] the days of the years of my life, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem?
010	2SA	019	035	I am this day eighty years old: can I then distinguish between good and evil? Can thy servant taste any longer what I eat or drink? can I any longer hear the voice of singing men or singing women? and wherefore shall thy servant any longer be a burden to my lord the king?
010	2SA	019	036	Thy servant will go a little way over Jordan with the king: and why does the king return me this recompense?
010	2SA	019	037	Let, I pray thee, thy servant remain, and I will die in my city, by the tomb of my father and of my mother. And, behold, thy servant Chamaam shall go over with my lord the king; and do thou to him as it seems good in thine eyes.
010	2SA	019	038	And the king said, Let Chamaam go over with me, and I will do to him what is good in my sight; and whatsoever thou shalt choose at my hand, I will do for thee.
010	2SA	019	039	And all the people went over Jordan, and the king went over; and the king kissed Berzelli, and blessed him; and he returned to his place.
010	2SA	019	040	And the king went over to Galgala, and Chamaam went over with him: and all the men of Juda went over with the king, and also half the people of Israel.
010	2SA	019	041	And behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said to the king, Why have our brethren the men of Juda stolen thee away, and caused the king and all his house to pass over Jordan, and all the men of David with him?
010	2SA	019	042	And all the men of Juda answered the men of Israel, and said, Because the king is near of kin to us: and why were you thus angry concerning this matter? have we indeed eaten of the king's food? or has he given us a gift, or has he sent us a portion?
010	2SA	019	043	And the men of Israel answered the men of Juda, and said, We have ten parts in the king, and we are older than you, we have also an interest in David above you: and why have ye thus insulted us, and why was not our advice taken before that of Juda, to bring back our king? And the speech of the men of Juda was sharper than the speech of the men of Israel.
010	2SA	020	001	And there was a transgressor [so] called there, and his name was Sabee, a Benjamite, the son of Bochori: and he blew the trumpet, and said, We have no portion in David, neither have we [any] inheritance in the son of Jessae: to thy tents, O Israel, every one.
010	2SA	020	002	And all the men of Israel went up from following David after Sabee the son of Bochori: but the men of Juda adhered to their king, from Jordan even to Jerusalem.
010	2SA	020	003	And David went into his house at Jerusalem: and the king took the ten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and he put them in a place of custody, and maintained them, and went not in to them; and they were kept living as widows, till the day of their death.
010	2SA	020	004	And the king said to Amessai, Call to me the men of Juda for three days, and do thou be present here.
010	2SA	020	005	And Amessai went to call Juda, and delayed beyond the time which David appointed him.
010	2SA	020	006	And David said to Amessai, Now shall Sabee the son of Bochori do us more harm than Abessalom: now then take thou with thee the servants of thy lord, and follow after him, lest he find for himself strong cities, so will he blind our eyes.
010	2SA	020	007	And there went out after him Amessai and the men of Joab, and the Cherethites, and the Phelethites, and all the mighty men: and they went out from Jerusalem to pursue after Sabee the son of Bochori.
010	2SA	020	008	And they [were] by the great stone that is in Gabaon: and Amessai went in before them: and Joab had upon him a military cloak over his apparel, and over it he was girded with a dagger fastened upon his loins in its scabbard: and the dagger came out, it even came out and fell.
010	2SA	020	009	And Joab said to Amessai, Art thou in health, [my] brother? and the right hand of Joab took hold of the beard of Amessai to kiss him.
010	2SA	020	010	And Amessai observed not the dagger that was in the hand of Joab: and Joab smote him with it on the loins, and his bowels were shed out upon the ground, and he did not repeat the blow, and he died: and Joab and Abessai his brother pursued after Sabee the son of Bochori.
010	2SA	020	011	And there stood over him one of the servants of Joab, and said, Who [is] he that is for Joab, and who [is] on the side of David following Joab?
010	2SA	020	012	And Amessai [was] weltering in blood in the midst of the way. And a man saw that all the people stood still; and he removed Amessai out of the path into a field, and he cast a garment upon him, because he saw every one that came to him standing still.
010	2SA	020	013	And when he was quickly removed from the road, every man of Israel passed after Joab to pursue after Sabee the son of Bochori.
010	2SA	020	014	And he went through all the tribes of Israel to Abel, and to Bethmacha; and all in Charri too were assembled, and followed after him.
010	2SA	020	015	And they came and besieged him in Abel and Phermacha: and they raised a mound against the city and it stood close to the wall; and all the people with Joab proposed to throw down the wall.
010	2SA	020	016	And a wise woman cried from the wall, and said, Hear, hear; say, I pray ye, to Joab, Draw near hither, and I will speak to him.
010	2SA	020	017	And he drew nigh to her, and the woman said to him, Art thou Joab? and he said, I [am]. And she said to him, Hear the words of thy handmaid; and Joab said, I do hear.
010	2SA	020	018	And she spoke, saying, Of old time they said thus, Surely one was asked in Abel, and Dan, whether the faithful in Israel failed in what they purposed; they will surely ask in Abel, even in like manner, whether they have failed.
010	2SA	020	019	I am a peaceable one of the strong ones in Israel; but thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother city in Israel: why dost thou seek to ruin the inheritance of the Lord?
010	2SA	020	020	And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should ruin or destroy.
010	2SA	020	021	Is not the case thus, that a man of mount Ephraim, Sabee, son of Bochori by name, has even lifted up his hand against king David? Give him only to me, and I will depart from the city. And the woman said to Joab, Behold, his head shall be thrown to thee over the wall.
010	2SA	020	022	And the woman went in to all the people, and she spoke to all the city in her wisdom; and they took off the head of Sabee the son of Bochori; and took it away and threw it to Joab: and he blew the trumpet, and the people separated from the city away from him, every man to his tent: and Joab returned to Jerusalem to the king.
010	2SA	020	023	And Joab [was] over all the forces of Israel: and Banaias the son of Jodae [was] over the Cherethites and over the Phelethites.
010	2SA	020	024	And Adoniram [was] over the tribute: and Josaphath the son of Achiluth [was] recorder.
010	2SA	020	025	And Susa [was] scribe: and Sadoc and Abiathar [were] priests.
010	2SA	020	026	Moreover Iras the [son of] Iarin was priest to David.
010	2SA	021	001	And there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David sought the face of the Lord. And the Lord said, [There is] guilt upon Saul and his house because of his bloody murder, whereby he slew the Gabaonites.
010	2SA	021	002	And King David called the Gabaonites, and said to them; —(now the Gabaonites are not the children of Israel, but [are] of the remnant of the Amorite, and the children of Israel had sworn to them: but Saul sought to smite them in his zeal for the children of Israel and Juda.)
010	2SA	021	003	And David said to the Gabaonites, What shall I do to you? and wherewithal shall I make atonement, that ye may bless the inheritance of the Lord?
010	2SA	021	004	And the Gabaonites said to him, We have no [question about] silver or gold with Saul and with his house; and there is no man for us to put to death in Israel.
010	2SA	021	005	And he said, What say ye? speak, and I will do it for you. And they said to the king, The man who would have made an end of us, and persecuted us, who plotted against us to destroy us, let us utterly destroy him, so that he shall have no standing in all the coasts of Israel.
010	2SA	021	006	Let one give us seven men of his sons, and let us hang them up in the sun to the Lord in Gabaon of Saul, as chosen out for the Lord. And the king said, I will give [them].
010	2SA	021	007	But the king spared Memphibosthe son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of the oath of the Lord that was between them, even between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.
010	2SA	021	008	And the king took the two sons of Respha the daughter of Aia, whom she bore to Saul, Hermonoi and Memphibosthe, and the five sons of Michol daughter of Saul, whom she bore to Esdriel son of Berzelli the Moulathite.
010	2SA	021	009	And he gave them into the hand of the Gabaonites, and they hanged them up to the sun in the mountain before the lord: and they fell, even the seven together: moreover they were put to death in the days of harvest at the commencement, in the beginning of barley-harvest.
010	2SA	021	010	And Respha the daughter of Aia took sackcloth, and fixed it for herself on the rock in the beginning of barley harvest, until water dropped upon them out of heaven: and she did not suffer the birds of the air to rest upon them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night.
010	2SA	021	011	And it was told David what Respha the daughter of Aia the concubine of Saul had done, [and they were faint, and Dan, the son of Joa of the offspring of the giants overtook them.]
010	2SA	021	012	And David went and took the bones of Saul, and the bones of Jonathan his son, from the men of the sons of Jabis Galaad, who stole them from the street of Baethsan; for the Philistines set them there in the day in which the Philistines smote Saul in Gelbue.
010	2SA	021	013	And he carried up thence the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son, and gathered the bones of them that had been hanged.
010	2SA	021	014	And they buried the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son, and the bones of them that had been hanged, in the land of Benjamin in the hill, in the sepulchre of Cis his father; and they did all things that the king commanded: and after this God hearkened to [the prayers of] the land.
010	2SA	021	015	And there was yet war between the Philistines and Israel: and David went down and his servants with him, and they fought with the Philistines, and David went.
010	2SA	021	016	And Jesbi, who was of the progeny of Rapha, and the head of whose spear [was] three hundred shekels of brass in weight, who also was girt with a club, even he thought to smite David.
010	2SA	021	017	And Abessa the son of Saruia helped him and smote the Philistine, and slew him. Then the men of David swore, saying, Thou shalt not any longer go out with us to battle, and thou shalt not quench the lamp of Israel.
010	2SA	021	018	And after this there was a battle again with the Philistines in Geth: then Sebocha the Astatothite slew Seph of the progeny of Rapha.
010	2SA	021	019	And there was a battle in Rom with the Philistines; and Eleanan son of Ariorgim the Bethleemite slew Goliath the Gittite; and the staff of his spear [was] as a weaver's beam.
010	2SA	021	020	And there was yet a battle in Geth: and there was a man of stature, and the fingers of his hands and the toes of his feet [were] six on each, four and twenty in number: and he also was born to Rapha.
010	2SA	021	021	And he defied Israel, and Jonathan son of Semei brother of David, smote him.
010	2SA	021	022	These four were born descendants of the giants in Geth, the family of Rapha; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.
010	2SA	022	001	And David spoke to the Lord the words of this song, in the day in which the Lord rescued him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul.
010	2SA	022	002	And the song was thus: O Lord, my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer,
010	2SA	022	003	my God; he shall be to me my guard, I will trust in him: [he is] my protector, and the horn of my salvation, my helper, and my sure refuge; thou shalt save me from the unjust man.
010	2SA	022	004	I will call upon the Lord who is worthy to be praised, and I shall be saved from my enemies.
010	2SA	022	005	For the troubles of death compassed me, the floods of iniquity amazed me:
010	2SA	022	006	the pangs of death surrounded me, the agonies of death prevented me.
010	2SA	022	007	When I am afflicted I will call upon the Lord, and will cry to my God, and he shall hear my voice out of his temple, and my cry shalt come into his ears.
010	2SA	022	008	And the earth was troubled and quaked, and the foundations of heaven were confounded and torn asunder, because the Lord was wroth with them.
010	2SA	022	009	There went up a smoke in his wrath, and fire out of his mouth devours: coals were kindled at it.
010	2SA	022	010	And he bowed the heavens, and came down, and [there was] darkness under his feet.
010	2SA	022	011	And he rode upon the cherubs and did fly, and was seen upon the wings of the wind.
010	2SA	022	012	And he made darkness his hiding-place; his tabernacle round about him was the darkness of waters, he condensed it with the clouds of the air.
010	2SA	022	013	At the brightness before him coals of fire were kindled.
010	2SA	022	014	The Lord thundered out of heaven, and the Most High uttered his voice.
010	2SA	022	015	And he sent forth arrows, and scattered them, and he flashed lightning, and dismayed them.
010	2SA	022	016	And the channels of the sea were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered, at the rebuke of the Lord, at the blast of the breath of his anger.
010	2SA	022	017	He sent from above and took me; he drew me out of many waters.
010	2SA	022	018	He delivered me from my strong enemies, from them that hated me, for they were stronger than I.
010	2SA	022	019	The days of my affliction prevented me; but the Lord was my stay.
010	2SA	022	020	And he brought me into a wide place, and rescued me, because he delighted in me.
010	2SA	022	021	And the Lord recompensed me according to my righteousness; even according to the purity of my hands did he recompense me.
010	2SA	022	022	Because, I kept the ways of the Lord, and did not wickedly depart from my God.
010	2SA	022	023	For all his judgments and his ordinances [were] before me: I departed not from them.
010	2SA	022	024	And I shall be blameless before him, and will keep myself from my iniquity.
010	2SA	022	025	And the Lord will recompense me according to my righteousness, and according to the purity of my hands in his eye-sight.
010	2SA	022	026	With the holy thou wilt be holy, and with the perfect man thou will be perfect,
010	2SA	022	027	and with the excellent thou wilt be excellent, and with the froward thou will be froward.
010	2SA	022	028	And thou wilt save the poor people, and wilt bring down the eyes of the haughty.
010	2SA	022	029	For thou, Lord, [art] my lamp, and the Lord shall shine forth to me in my darkness.
010	2SA	022	030	For by thee shall I run [as] a girded man, and by my God shall I leap over a wall.
010	2SA	022	031	As for the Mighty One, his way [is] blameless: the word of the Lord [is] strong [and] tried in the fire: he is a protector to all that put their trust in him.
010	2SA	022	032	Who [is] strong, but the Lord? and who will be a Creator except our God?
010	2SA	022	033	[It is] the Mighty One who strengthens me with might, and has prepared my way without fault.
010	2SA	022	034	He makes my feet like hart's feet, and sets me upon the high places.
010	2SA	022	035	He teaches my hands to war, and has broken a brazen bow by my arm.
010	2SA	022	036	And thou hast given me the shield of my salvation, and thy propitious dealing has increased me,
010	2SA	022	037	so as to make room under me for my going, and my legs did not totter.
010	2SA	022	038	I will pursue my enemies, and will utterly destroy them; and I will not turn again till I have consumed them.
010	2SA	022	039	And I will crush them, and they shall not rise; and they shall fall under my feet.
010	2SA	022	040	And thou shalt strengthen me with power for the war; thou shalt cause them that rise up against me to bow down under me.
010	2SA	022	041	And thou hast caused mine enemies to flee before me, even them that hated me, and thou hast slain them.
010	2SA	022	042	They shall cry, and there shall be no helper; to the Lord, but he hearkens not to them.
010	2SA	022	043	And I ground them as the dust of the earth, I beat them small as the mire of the streets.
010	2SA	022	044	And thou shalt deliver me from the striving of the peoples, thou shalt keep me [to be] the head of the Gentiles: a people which I knew not served me.
010	2SA	022	045	The strange children feigned [obedience] to me; they hearkened to me as soon as they heard.
010	2SA	022	046	The strange children shall be cast away, and shall be overthrown out of their hiding places.
010	2SA	022	047	The Lord lives, and blessed [be] my guardian, and my God, my strong keeper, shall be exalted.
010	2SA	022	048	The Lord who avenges me [is] strong, chastening the nations under me,
010	2SA	022	049	and bringing me out from my enemies: and thou shalt set me on high from among those that rise up against me: thou shalt deliver me from the violent man.
010	2SA	022	050	Therefore will I confess to thee, O Lord, among the Gentiles, and sing to thy name.
010	2SA	022	051	He magnifies the salvation of his king, and works mercy for his anointed, even for David and for his seed for ever.
010	2SA	023	001	And these [are] the last words of David. Faithful [is] David the son of Jessae, and faithful the man whom the Lord raised up to be the anointed of the God of Jacob, and beautiful [are] the psalms of Israel.
010	2SA	023	002	The Spirit of the Lord spoke by me, and his word [was] upon my tongue.
010	2SA	023	003	The God of Israel says, A watchman out of Israel spoke to me a parable: I said among men, How will ye strengthen the fear of the anointed?
010	2SA	023	004	And in the morning light of God, let the sun arise in the morning, from the light of which the Lord passed on, and as it were from the rain of the tender grass upon the earth.
010	2SA	023	005	For my house [is] not so with the Mighty One: for he has made an everlasting covenant with me, ready, guarded at every time; for all my salvation and all my desire [is], that the wicked should not flourish.
010	2SA	023	006	All these [are] as a thorn thrust forth, for they shall not be taken with the hand,
010	2SA	023	007	and a man shall not labour among them; and [one shall have] that which is fully armed with iron, and the staff of a spear, an he shall burn them with fire, and they shall be burnt in their shame.
010	2SA	023	008	These [are] the names of the mighty men of David: Jebosthe the Chananite is a captain of the third [part]: Adinon the Asonite, he drew his sword against eight hundred soldiers at once.
010	2SA	023	009	And after him Eleanan the son of his uncle, son of Dudi who was among the three mighty men with David; and when he defied the Philistines they were gathered there to war, and the men of Israel went up.
010	2SA	023	010	He arose an smote the Philistines, until his hand was weary, and his hand clave to the sword: and the Lord wrought a great salvation in that day, and the people rested behind him only to strip [the slain].
010	2SA	023	011	And after him Samaia the son of Asa the Arachite: and the Philistines were gathered to Theria; and there was there a portion of ground full of lentiles; and the people fled before the Philistines.
010	2SA	023	012	And he stood firm in the midst of the portion, and rescued it, and smote the Philistines; and the Lord wrought a great deliverance.
010	2SA	023	013	And three out of the thirty went down, and came to Cason to David, to the cave of Odollam; and [there was] an army of the Philistines, and they encamped in the valley of Raphain.
010	2SA	023	014	And David [was] then in the strong hold, and the garrison of the Philistines [was] then in Bethleem.
010	2SA	023	015	And David longed, and said, Who will give me water to drink out of the well that is in Bethleem by the gate? now the band of the Philistines [was] then in Bethleem.
010	2SA	023	016	And the three mighty men broke through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well that was in Bethleem in the gate: and they took it, and brought it to David, and he would not drink it, but poured it out before the Lord.
010	2SA	023	017	And he said, O Lord, forbid that I should do this, that I should drink of the blood of the men who went at [the risk of] their lives: and he would not drink it. These things did these three mighty men.
010	2SA	023	018	And Abessa the brother of Joab the son of Saruia, he [was] chief among the three, and he lifted up his spear against three hundred whom he slew; and he had a name among three.
010	2SA	023	019	Of those three [he was] most honourable, and he became a chief over them, but he reached not to the [first] three.
010	2SA	023	020	And Banaeas the son of Jodae, he was abundant in [mighty] deeds, from Cabeseel, and he smote the two sons of Ariel of Moab: and he went down and smote a lion in the midst of a pit on a snowy day.
010	2SA	023	021	He smote an Egyptian, a wonderful man, and in the hand of the Egyptian [was] a spear as the side of a ladder; and he went down to him with a staff, and snatched the spear from the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear.
010	2SA	023	022	These things did Banaeas the son of Jodae, and he had a name among the three mighty men.
010	2SA	023	023	He was honourable among the [second] three, but he reached not to the [first] three: and David made him his reporter. And these [are] the names of King David's mighty men.
010	2SA	023	024	Asael Joab's brother; he [was] among the thirty. Eleanan son of Dudi his uncle in Bethleem.
010	2SA	023	025	Saema the Rudaean.
010	2SA	023	026	Selles the Kelothite: Iras the son of Isca the Thecoite.
010	2SA	023	027	Abiezer the Anothite, of the sons of the Anothite.
010	2SA	023	028	Ellon the Aoite; Noere the Netophatite.
010	2SA	023	029	Esthai the son of Riba of Gabaeth, son of Benjamin the Ephrathite; Asmoth the Bardiamite; Emasu the Salabonite:
010	2SA	023	030	Adroi of the brooks.
010	2SA	023	031	Gadabiel son of the Arabothaeite.
010	2SA	023	032	the sons of Asan, Jonathan;
010	2SA	023	033	Samnan the Arodite; Amnan the son of Arai the Saraurite.
010	2SA	023	034	Aliphaleth the son of Asbites, the son of the Machachachite; Eliab the son of Achitophel the Gelonite.
010	2SA	023	035	Asarai the Carmelite the son of Uraeoerchi.
010	2SA	023	036	Gaal the son of Nathana. The son of much valour, [the son] of Galaaddi. Elie the Ammanite.
010	2SA	023	037	Gelore the Bethorite, armour-bearer to Joab, son of Saruia.
010	2SA	023	038	Iras the Ethirite. Gerab the Ethenite.
010	2SA	023	039	Urias the Chettite: thirty-seven in all.
010	2SA	024	001	And the Lord caused his anger to burn forth again in Israel, and [Satan] stirred up David against them, saying, Go, number Israel and Juda.
010	2SA	024	002	And the king said to Joab commander of the host, who was with him, Go now through all the tribes of Israel and Juda, from Dan even to Bersabee, and number the people, and I will know the number of the people.
010	2SA	024	003	And Joab said to the king, Now may the Lord add to the people a hundred-fold as many as they are, and [may] the eyes of my lord the king see it: but why does my lord the king desire this thing?
010	2SA	024	004	Nevertheless the word of the king prevailed against Joab an the captains of the host: And Joab and the captains of the host went out before the king to number the people of Israel.
010	2SA	024	005	And they went over Jordan, and encamped in Aroer, on the right of the city which is in the midst of the valley of Gad and Eliezer.
010	2SA	024	006	And they came to Galaad, and into the land of Thabason, which is Adasai, and they came to Danidan and Udan, and compassed Sidon.
010	2SA	024	007	And they came to Mapsar of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Evite and the Chananite: and they came by the South of Juda to Bersabee.
010	2SA	024	008	And they compassed the whole land; and they arrived at Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.
010	2SA	024	009	And Joab gave in the number of the census of the people to the king: and Israel consisted of eight hundred thousand men of might that drew sword; and the men of Juda, five hundred thousand fighting men.
010	2SA	024	010	And the heart of David smote him after he had numbered the people; and David said to the Lord, I have sinned grievously, O Lord, [in] what I have now done: remove, I pray thee, the iniquity of thy servant, for I have been exceedingly foolish.
010	2SA	024	011	And David rose early in the morning, and the word of the Lord came to the prophet Gad, the seer, saying, Go, and speak to David, saying,
010	2SA	024	012	Thus saith the Lord, I bring [one of] three things upon thee: now choose thee one of them, and I will do [it] to thee.
010	2SA	024	013	And Gad went in to David, and told him, and said to him, Choose [one of these things] to befall thee, whether there shall come upon thee [for] three years famine in thy land; or that thou shouldest flee three months before thine enemies, and they should pursue thee; or that there should be [for] three days mortality in thy land. Now then decide, and see what answer I shall return to him that sent me.
010	2SA	024	014	And David said to Gad, On every side I am much straitened: let me fall now into the hands of the Lord, for his compassions [are] very many; and let me not fall into the hands of man.
010	2SA	024	015	So David chose for himself the mortality: and [they were] the days of wheat-harvest; and the Lord sent a pestilence upon Israel from morning till noon, and the plague began among the people; and there died of the people from Dan even to Bersabee seventy thousand men.
010	2SA	024	016	And the angel of the Lord stretched out his hand against Jerusalem to destroy it, and the Lord repented of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed the people, [It is] enough now, withhold thine hand. And the angel of the Lord was by the threshing-floor of Orna the Jebusite.
010	2SA	024	017	And David spoke to the Lord when he saw the angel smiting the people, and he said, Behold, it is I that have done wrong, but these sheep what have they done? Let thy hand, I pray thee, be upon me, and upon my father's house.
010	2SA	024	018	And Gad came to David in that day, and said to him, Go up, and set up to the Lord and altar in the threshing-floor of Orna the Jebusite.
010	2SA	024	019	And David went up according to the word of Gad, as the Lord commanded him.
010	2SA	024	020	And Orna looked out, and saw the king and his servants coming on before him: and Orna went forth, and did obeisance to the king with his face to the earth.
010	2SA	024	021	And Orna said, Why has my lord the king come to his servant? and David said, To buy of thee the threshing-floor, in order to build an altar to the Lord that the plague may be restrained from off the people.
010	2SA	024	022	And Orna said to David, Let my lord the king take and offer to the Lord that which is good in his eyes: behold, [here are] oxen for a whole-burnt-offering, and the wheels and furniture of the oxen for wood.
010	2SA	024	023	Orna gave all to the king: and Orna said to the king, The Lord thy God bless thee.
010	2SA	024	024	And the king said to Orna, Nay, but I will surely buy it of thee at a fair price, and I will not offer to the Lord my God a whole-burnt-offering for nothing. So David purchased the threshing-floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.
010	2SA	024	025	And David built there an altar to the Lord, and offered up whole-burnt-offerings and peace-offerings: and Solomon made an addition to the altar afterwards, for it was little at first. And the Lord hearkened to the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.

# BOOK	011	1KI	1 Kings	Kings III
011	1KI	001	001	And king David [was] old and advanced in days, and they covered him with clothes, and he was not warmed.
011	1KI	001	002	And his servants said, Let them seek for the king a young virgin, and she shall wait on the king, and cherish him, and lie with him, and my lord the king shall be warmed.
011	1KI	001	003	So they sought for a fair damsel out of all the coasts of Israel; and they found Abisag the Somanite, and they brought her to the king.
011	1KI	001	004	And the damsel was extremely beautiful, and she cherished the king, and ministered to him, but the king knew her not.
011	1KI	001	005	And Adonias the son of Aggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king; and he prepared for himself chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.
011	1KI	001	006	And his father never at any time checked him, saying, Why hast thou done [thus]? and he was also very handsome in appearance, and his mother bore him after Abessalom.
011	1KI	001	007	And he conferred with Joab the son of Saruia, and with Abiathar the priest, and they followed after Adonias.
011	1KI	001	008	But Sadoc the priest, and Banaeas the son of Jodae, and Nathan the prophet, and Semei, and Resi, and the mighty men of David, did not follow Adonias.
011	1KI	001	009	And Adonias sacrificed sheep and calves and lambs by the stone of Zoelethi, which was near Rogel: and he called all his brethren, and all the adult [men] of Juda, servants of the king.
011	1KI	001	010	But Nathan the prophet, and Banaeas, and the mighty [men], and Solomon his brother, he did not call.
011	1KI	001	011	And Nathan spoke to Bersabee the mother of Solomon, saying, Hast thou not heard that Adonias the son of Aggith reigns, and our lord David knows it not?
011	1KI	001	012	And now come, let me, I pray, give thee counsel, and thou shalt rescue thy life, and the life of thy son Solomon.
011	1KI	001	013	Haste, and go in to king David, and thou shalt speak to him, saying, Hast not thou, my lord, O king, sworn to thine handmaid, saying, Thy son Solomon shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? why then does Adonias reign?
011	1KI	001	014	And behold, while thou art still speaking there with the king, I also will come in after thee, and will confirm thy words.
011	1KI	001	015	So Bersabee went in to the king into the chamber: and the king was very old, and Abisag the Somanite was ministering to the king.
011	1KI	001	016	And Bersabee bowed, and did obeisance to the king; and the king said, What is thy request?
011	1KI	001	017	And she said, My lord, thou didst swear by the Lord thy God to thine handmaid, saying, Thy son Solomon shall reign after me, and shall sit upon my throne.
011	1KI	001	018	And now, behold, Adonias reigns, and thou, my lord, O king, knowest [it] not.
011	1KI	001	019	And he has sacrificed calves and lambs and sheep in abundance, and has called all the king's sons, and Abiathar the priest and Joab the commander-in-chief of the host; but Solomon thy servant he has not called.
011	1KI	001	020	And thou, my lord, O king, —the eyes of all Israel [are] upon thee, to tell them who shall sit upon the throne of my lord the king after him.
011	1KI	001	021	And it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and Solomon my son shall be offenders.
011	1KI	001	022	And behold, while she was yet talking with the king, Nathan the prophet came. And it was reported to the king,
011	1KI	001	023	Behold, Nathan the prophet [is here]: and he came in to the king's presence, and did obeisance to the king with his face to the ground.
011	1KI	001	024	And Nathan said, My lord, O king, didst thou say, Adonias shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?
011	1KI	001	025	For he has gone down to-day, and has sacrificed calves and lambs and sheep in abundance, and has called all the king's sons, and the chiefs of the army, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they are eating and drinking before him, and they said, [Long] live king Adonias.
011	1KI	001	026	But he has not invited me thy servant, and Sadoc the priest, and Banaeas the son of Jodae, and Solomon thy servant.
011	1KI	001	027	Has this matter happened by the authority of my lord the king, and hast thou not made known to thy servant who shall sit upon the throne of my lord the king after him?
011	1KI	001	028	And king David answered and said, Call me Bersabee: and she came in before the king, and stood before him.
011	1KI	001	029	And the king swore, and said, [As] the Lord lives who redeemed my soul out of all affliction,
011	1KI	001	030	as I swore to thee by the Lord God of Israel, saying, Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead, so will I do this day.
011	1KI	001	031	And Bersabee bowed with her face to the ground, and did obeisance to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever.
011	1KI	001	032	And king David said, Call me Sadoc the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Banaeas the son of Jodae: and they came in before the king.
011	1KI	001	033	And the king said to them, Take the servants of your lord with you, and mount my son Solomon upon my own mule, and bring him down to Gion.
011	1KI	001	034	And there let Sadoc the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him to be king over Israel, and do ye sound the trumpet, and ye shall say, Let king Solomon live.
011	1KI	001	035	And he shall sit upon my throne, and reign in my stead: and I have given charge that he should be for a prince over Israel and Juda.
011	1KI	001	036	And Banaeas the son of Jodae answered the king and said, So let it be: may the Lord God of my lord the king confirm [it].
011	1KI	001	037	As the Lord was with my lord the king, so let him be with Solomon, and let him exalt his throne beyond the throne of my lord king David.
011	1KI	001	038	And Sadoc the priest went down, and Nathan the prophet, and Banaeas son of Jodae, and the Cherethite, and the Phelethite, and they mounted Solomon upon the mule of king David, and led him away to Gion.
011	1KI	001	039	And Sadoc the priest took the horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon, and blew the trumpet; and all the people said, Let king Solomon live.
011	1KI	001	040	And all the people went up after him, and they danced in choirs, and rejoiced with great joy, and the earth quaked with their voice.
011	1KI	001	041	And Adonias and all his guests heard, and they had [just] left off eating: and Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, and said, What [means] the voice of the city in tumult?
011	1KI	001	042	While he was yet speaking, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came in: and Adonias said, Come in, for thou art a mighty man, and [thou comest] to bring glad tidings.
011	1KI	001	043	And Jonathan answered and said, Verily our lord king David has made Solomon king:
011	1KI	001	044	and the king has sent with him Sadoc the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Banaeas the son of Jodae, and the Cherethite, and the Phelethite, and they have mounted him on the king's mule;
011	1KI	001	045	and Sadoc the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him in Gion, and have gone up thence rejoicing, and the city resounded: this [is] the sound which ye have heard.
011	1KI	001	046	And Solomon is seated upon the throne of the kingdom.
011	1KI	001	047	And the servants of the king have gone in to bless our lord king David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne; and the king worshipped upon his bed.
011	1KI	001	048	Moreover thus said the king, Blessed [be] the Lord God of Israel, who has this day appointed one of my seed sitting on my throne, and my eyes see it.
011	1KI	001	049	And all the guests of Adonias were dismayed, and every man went his way.
011	1KI	001	050	And Adonias feared because of Solomon, and arose, and departed, and laid hold on the horns of the altar.
011	1KI	001	051	And it was reported to Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonias fears king Solomon, and holds the horns of the altar, saying, Let Solomon swear to me this day, that he will not slay his servant with the sword.
011	1KI	001	052	And Solomon said, If he should be a valiant man, there shall not a hair of his fall to the ground; but if evil be found in him, he shall die.
011	1KI	001	053	And king Solomon sent, and they brought him away from the altar; and he went in and did obeisance to king Solomon: and Solomon said to him, Go to thy house.
011	1KI	002	001	And the days of David drew near that he should die: and he addressed his son Solomon, saying, I go the way of all the earth:
011	1KI	002	002	but be thou strong, and shew thyself a man;
011	1KI	002	003	and keep the charge of the Lord thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep the commandments and the ordinances and the judgments which are written in the law of Moses; that thou mayest understand what thou shalt do in all things that I command thee:
011	1KI	002	004	that the Lord may confirm his word which he spoke, saying, If thy children shall take heed to their way to walk before me in truth with all their heart, [I promise thee], saying, there shall not fail thee a man on the throne of Israel.
011	1KI	002	005	Moreover thou knowest all that Joab the son of Saruia did to me, what he did to the two captains of the forces of Israel, to Abenner the son of Ner, and to Amessai the son of Jether, that he slew them, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put innocent blood on his girdle that was about his loins, and on his sandal that was on his foot.
011	1KI	002	006	Therefore thou shalt deal [with him] according to thy wisdom, and thou shalt not bring down his grey hairs in peace to the grave.
011	1KI	002	007	But thou shalt deal kindly with the sons of Berzelli the Galaadite, and they shall be among those that eat at thy table; for thus they drew nigh to me when I fled from the face of thy brother Abessalom.
011	1KI	002	008	And, behold, [there is] with thee Semei the son of Gera, a Benjamite of Baurim: and he cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went into the camp; and he came down to Jordan to meet me, and I swore to him by the Lord, saying, I will not put thee to death with the sword.
011	1KI	002	009	But thou shalt by no means hold him guiltless, for thou art a wise man, and wilt know what thou shalt do to him, and shalt bring down his grey hairs with blood to the grave.
011	1KI	002	010	And David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.
011	1KI	002	011	And the days which David reigned over Israel [were] forty years; he reigned seven years in Chebron, and thirty-three years in Jerusalem.
011	1KI	002	012	And Solomon sat on the throne of his father David, and his kingdom was established greatly.
011	1KI	002	013	And Adonias the son of Aggith came in to Bersabee the mother of Solomon, and did obeisance to her: and she said, Dost thou enter peaceably? and he said, Peaceably:
011	1KI	002	014	I have business with thee. And she said to him, Say on.
011	1KI	002	015	And he said to her, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and all Israel turned their face toward me for a king; but the kingdom was turned [from me] and became my brother's: for it was [appointed] to him from the Lord.
011	1KI	002	016	And now I make one request of thee, do not turn away thy face. And Bersabee said to him, Speak [on].
011	1KI	002	017	And he said to her, Speak, I pray thee, to king Solomon, for he will not turn away his face from thee, and let him give me Abisag the Somanite for a wife.
011	1KI	002	018	And Bersabee said, Well; I will speak for thee to the king.
011	1KI	002	019	And Bersabee went in to king Solomon to speak to him concerning Adonias; and the king rose up to meet her, and kissed her, and sat on the throne, and a throne was set for the mother of the king, and she sat on his right hand.
011	1KI	002	020	And she said to him, I ask of thee one little request; turn not away my face from thee. And the king said to her, Ask, my mother, and I will not reject thee.
011	1KI	002	021	And she said, Let, I pray thee, Abisag the Somanite be given to Adonias thy brother to wife.
011	1KI	002	022	And king Solomon answered and said to his mother, And why hast thou asked Abisag for Adonias? ask for him the kingdom also; for he [is] my elder brother, and he has for his companion Abiathar the priest, and Joab the son of Saruia the commander-in-chief.
011	1KI	002	023	And king Solomon swore by the Lord, saying, God do so to me, and more also, [if it be not] that Adonias has spoken this word against his own life.
011	1KI	002	024	And now [as] the Lord lives who has established me, and set me on the throne of my father David, and he has made me a house, as the Lord spoke, this day shall Adonias be put to death.
011	1KI	002	025	So king Solomon sent by the hand of Banaeas the son of Jodae, and he slew him, and Adonias died in that day.
011	1KI	002	026	And the king said to Abiathar the priest, Depart thou quickly to Anathoth to thy farm, for thou art worthy of death this day; but I will not slay thee, because thou hast borne the ark of the covenant of the Lord before my father, and because thou was afflicted in all things wherein my father was afflicted.
011	1KI	002	027	And Solomon removed Abiathar from being a priest of the Lord, that the word of the Lord might be fulfilled, which he spoke concerning the house of Heli in Selom.
011	1KI	002	028	And the report came to Joab son of Saruia; for Joab had turned after Adonias, and he went not after Solomon: and Joab fled to the tabernacle of the Lord, and caught hold of the horns of the altar.
011	1KI	002	029	And it was told Solomon, saying, Joab has fled to the tabernacle of the Lord, and lo! he has hold of the horns of the altar. And king Solomon sent to Joab, saying, What ails thee, that thou hast fled to the altar? and Joab said, Because I was afraid of thee, and fled for refuge to the Lord. And Solomon sent Banaeas son of Jodae, saying, Go and slay him, and bury him.
011	1KI	002	030	And Banaeas son of Jodae came to Joab to the tabernacle of the Lord, and said to him, Thus says the king, Come forth. And Joab said, I will not come forth, for I will die here. And Banaeas son of Jodae returned and spoke to the king, saying, Thus has Joab spoken, and thus has he answered me.
011	1KI	002	031	And the king said to him, Go, and do to him as he has spoken, and kill him: and thou shalt bury him, and thou shalt remove this day the blood which he shed without cause, from me and from the house of my father.
011	1KI	002	032	And the Lord has returned upon his own head the blood of his unrighteousness, inasmuch as he attacked two men more righteous and better than himself, and slew them with the sword, and my father David knew not of their blood, [even] Abenner the son of Ner the commander-in-chief of Israel, and Amessa the son of Jether the commander-in-chief of Juda.
011	1KI	002	033	And their blood is returned upon his head, and upon the head of his seed for ever: but to David, and his seed, and his house, and his throne, may there be peace for ever from the Lord.
011	1KI	002	034	So Banaeas son of Jodae went up, and attacked him, and slew him, and buried him in his house in the wilderness.
011	1KI	002	035	And the king appointed Banaeas son of Jodae in his place over the host; and the kingdom was established in Jerusalem; and [as for] Sadoc the priest, the king appointed him to be high priest in the room of Abiathar. And Solomon son of David reigned over Israel and Juda in Jerusalem: and the Lord gave understanding to Solomon, and very much wisdom, and largeness of heart, as the sand by the sea-shore.
011	1KI	003	001	And the wisdom of Solomon abounded exceedingly beyond the wisdom of all the ancients, and beyond all the wise men of Egypt: and he took the daughter of Pharao, and brought her into the city of David, until he had finished building his own house, and the house of the Lord first, and the wall of Jerusalem round about. In seven years he made and finished [them]. And Solomon had seventy thousand bearers of burdens, and eight thousand hewers of stone in the mountain: and Solomon made the sea, and the bases, and the great lavers, and the pillars, and the fountain of the court, and the brazen sea— and he built the citadel as a defence above it, he made a breach in the wall of the city of David: thus the daughter of Pharao went up out of the city of David to her house which he built for her. Then he built the citadel: and Solomon offered up three whole-burnt-offerings in the year, and peace-offerings on the altar which he built to the Lord, and he burnt incense before the Lord, and finished the house. And these are the chief persons who presided over the works of Solomon; three thousand and six hundred masters of the people that wrought the works. And he burit Assur, and Magdo, and Gazer, and upper Baethoron, and Ballath: only after he had built the house of the Lord, and the wall of Jerusalem round about, afterwards he built these cities. And when David was yet living, he charged Solomon, saying, Behold, there is with thee Semei the son of Gera, of the seed of Benjamin out of Chebron: he cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went into the camp; and he came down to meet me at Jordan, and I swore to him by the Lord, saying, He shall not be slain with the sword. But now do not thou hold him guiltless, for thou art a man of understanding, and thou wilt know what thou shalt do to him, and thou shalt bring down his grey hairs with blood to the grave. And the king called Semei, and said to him, Build thee a house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and thou shalt not go out thence any whither. And it shall come to pass in the day that thou shalt go forth and cross over the brook Kedron, know assuredly that thou shalt certainly die: thy blood shall be upon thine head. And the king caused him to swear in that day. And Semei said to the king, Good [is] the word that thou hast spoken, my lord O king: thus will thy servant do. And Semei dwelt in Jerusalem three years. And it came to pass after the three years, that two servants of Semei ran away to Anchus son of Maacha king of Geth: and it was told Semei, saying, Behold, thy servants [are] in Geth. And Semei rose up, and saddled his ass, and went to Geth to Anchus to seek out his servants: and Semei went, and brought his servants out of Geth. And it was told Solomon, saying, Semei is gone out of Jerusalem to Geth, and has brought back his servants. And the king sent and called Semei, and said to him, Did I not adjure thee by the Lord, and testify to thee, saying, In whatsoever day thou shalt go out of Jerusalem, and go to the right or left, know certainly that thou shalt assuredly die? And why hast thou not kept the oath of the Lord, and the commandment which I commanded thee? And the king said to Semei, Thou knowest all thy mischief which thy heart knows, which thou didst to David my father: and the Lord has recompensed thy mischief on thine [own] head. And king Solomon [is] blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the Lord for ever. And Solomon commanded Banaeas the son of Jodae, and he went forth and slew him. And king Solomon was very prudent and wise: and Juda and Israel [were] very many, as the sand which is by the sea for multitude, eating, and drinking, and rejoicing: and Solomon was chief in all the kingdoms, and they brought gifts, and served Solomon all the days of his life. And Solomon began to open the domains of Libanus, and he built Thermae in the wilderness. And this was the daily provision of Solomon, thirty measures of fine flour, and sixty measures of ground meal, ten choice calves, and twenty oxen from the pastures, and a hundred sheep, besides stags, and does, and choice fed birds. For he ruled in all the country on this side the river, from Raphi unto Gaza, over all the kings on this side the river: and he was at peace on all sides round about; and Juda and Israel dwelt safely, every one under his vine and under his fig tree, eating and drinand feasting, from Dan even to Bersabee, all the days of Solomon. And these [were] the princes of Solomon; Azariu son of Sadoc the priest, and Orniu son of Nathan chief of the officers, and he went to his house; and Suba the scribe, and Basa son of Achithalam recorder, and Abi son of Joab commander-in-chief, and Achire son of Edrai [was] over the levies, and Banaeas son of Jodae over the household and over the brickwork, and Cachur the son of Nathan [was] counsellor. And Solomon had forty thousand brood mares for his chariots, and twelve thousand horses. And he reigned over all the kings from the river and to the land of the Philistines, and to the borders of Egypt: so Solomon the son of David reigned over Israel and Juda in Jerusalem.
011	1KI	003	002	Nevertheless the people burnt incense on the high places, because a house had not yet been built to the Lord.
011	1KI	003	003	And Solomon loved the Lord, [so as] to walk in the ordinances of David his father; only he sacrificed and burnt incense on the high places.
011	1KI	003	004	And he arose and went to Gabaon to sacrifice there, for that [was] the highest place, and great: Solomon offered a whole-burnt-offering of a thousand [victims] on the altar in Gabaon.
011	1KI	003	005	And the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream by night, and the Lord said to Solomon, Ask some petition for thyself.
011	1KI	003	006	And Solomon said, Thou hast dealt very mercifully with thy servant David my father according as he walked before thee in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee, and thou hast kept for him this great mercy, to set his son upon his throne, as [it is] this day.
011	1KI	003	007	And now, O Lord my God, thou hast appointed thy servant in the room of David my father; and I am a little child, and know not my going out an my coming in.
011	1KI	003	008	But thy servant [is] in the midst of thy people, whom thou hast chosen, a great people, which as this day cannot be numbered.
011	1KI	003	009	Thou shalt give therefore to thy servant a heart to hear and to judge thy people justly, and to discern between good and evil: for who will be able to judge this thy great people?
011	1KI	003	010	And it was pleasing before the Lord, that Solomon asked this thing.
011	1KI	003	011	And the Lord said to him, Because thou hast asked this thing of me, and hast not asked for thyself long life, and hast not asked wealth, nor hast asked the lives of thine enemies, but hast asked for thyself understanding to hear judgment;
011	1KI	003	012	behold, I have done according to thy word: behold, I have given thee an understanding and wise heart: there has not been [any one] like thee before thee, and after thee there shall not arise one like thee.
011	1KI	003	013	And I have given thee what thou hast not asked, wealth and glory, so that there has not been any one like thee among kings.
011	1KI	003	014	And if thou wilt walk in my way, to keep my commandments and my ordinances, as David thy father walked, then will I multiply thy days.
011	1KI	003	015	And Solomon awoke, and, behold, [it was] a dream: and he arose and came to Jerusalem, and stood before the altar that was in front of the ark of the covenant of the Lord in Sion: and he offered whole-burnt-offerings, and sacrificed peace-offerings, and made a great banquet for himself and all his servants.
011	1KI	003	016	Then there appeared two harlots before the king, and they stood before him.
011	1KI	003	017	And the one woman said, Hear me, [my] lord; I and this woman dwelt in one house, and we were delivered in the house.
011	1KI	003	018	And it came to pass on the third day after I was delivered, this woman also was delivered: and we [were] together; and there was no one with us besides our two selves in the house.
011	1KI	003	019	And this woman's child died in the night; because she overlaid it.
011	1KI	003	020	and she arose in the middle of the night, and took my son from my arms, and laid him in her bosom, and laid her dead son in my bosom.
011	1KI	003	021	and I arose in the morning to suckle my son, and he was dead: and, behold, I considered him in the morning, and, behold, it was not my son whom I bore.
011	1KI	003	022	And the other woman said, No, but the living [is] my son, and the dead [is] thy son. So they spoke before the king.
011	1KI	003	023	and the king said to them, Thou sayest, This [is] my son, [even] the living [one], and this woman's son [is] the dead one: and thou sayest, No, but the living [is] my son, and the dead [is] thy son.
011	1KI	003	024	And the king said, Fetch a sword. And they brought a sword before the king.
011	1KI	003	025	And the king said, Divide the live child, the suckling, in two; and give half of it to one, and half of it to the other.
011	1KI	003	026	And the woman whose the living child was, answered and said to the king, (for her bowels yearned over her son) and she said, I pray thee, [my] lord, give her the child, and in nowise slay it. But the other said, Let it be neither mine nor hers; divide [it].
011	1KI	003	027	Then the king answered and said, Give the child to her that said, 'Give it to her, and by no means slay it:' she [is] its mother.
011	1KI	003	028	and all Israel heard this judgment which the king judged, and they feared before the king; because they saw that the wisdom of God [was] in him, to execute judgment.
011	1KI	004	001	And king Solomon reigned over Israel.
011	1KI	004	002	And these [are] the princes which he had; Azarias son of Sadoc.
011	1KI	004	003	Eliaph, and Achia son of Seba, scribes; and Josaphat son of Achilud, recorder.
011	1KI	004	004	And Banaeas son of Jodae over the host; and Sadoc and Abiathar [were] priests.
011	1KI	004	005	And Ornia the son of Nathan [was] over the officers; and Zabuth son of Nathan [was] the king's friend.
011	1KI	004	006	And Achisar was steward, and Eliac the [chief] steward; and Eliab the son of Saph [was] over the family: and Adoniram the son of Audon over the tribute.
011	1KI	004	007	And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, to provide for the king and his household; each one's turn came to supply for a month in the year.
011	1KI	004	008	And these [were] their names: Been the son of Or in the mount of Ephraim, one.
011	1KI	004	009	The son of Dacar, in Makes, and in Salabin, and Baethsamys, and Elon as far as Bethanan, one.
011	1KI	004	010	The son of Esdi in Araboth; his [was] Socho, and all the land of Opher.
011	1KI	004	011	All Nephthador [belonged to] the son of Aminadab, Tephath daughter of Solomon was his wife, one.
011	1KI	004	012	Bana son of Achiluth [had] Ithaanach, and Mageddo, and [his was] the whole house of San which was by Sesathan below Esrae, and from Bethsan as far as Sabelmaula, as far as Maeber Lucam, one.
011	1KI	004	013	The son of Naber in Raboth Galaad, to him [fell] the lot of Ergab in Basan, sixty great cities with walls, and brazen bars, one.
011	1KI	004	014	Achinadab son of Saddo, [had] Maanaim.
011	1KI	004	015	Achimaas [was] in Nephthalim, and he took Basemmath daughter of Solomon to wife, one.
011	1KI	004	016	Baana son of Chusi, in Aser and in Baaloth, one,
011	1KI	004	017	Josaphat son of Phuasud [was] in Issachar.
011	1KI	004	018	Semei son of Ela, in Benjamin.
011	1KI	004	019	Gaber son of Adai in the land of Gad, [the land] of Seon king of Esebon, and of Og king of Basan, and one officer in the land of Juda.
011	1KI	004	020	And thus the officers provided king Solomon: and [they execute] every one in his month all the orders for the table of the king, they omit nothing.
011	1KI	004	021	And they carried the barley and the straw for the horses and the chariots to the place where the king might be, each according to his charge.
011	1KI	004	022	And these [were] the requisite supplies for Solomon: in one day thirty measures of fine flour, and sixty measures of fine pounded meal,
011	1KI	004	023	and ten choice calves, and twenty pastured oxen, and a hundred sheep, besides stags, and choice fatted does.
011	1KI	004	024	For he had dominion on this side the river, and he was at peace on all sides round about.
011	1KI	004	029	And the Lord gave understanding to Solomon, and very much wisdom, and enlargement of heart, as the sand on the seashore.
011	1KI	004	030	And Solomon abounded greatly beyond the wisdom of all the ancients, and beyond all the wise men of Egypt.
011	1KI	004	031	And he was wiser than all [other] men: and he was wiser than Gaethan the Zarite, and [than] Aenan, and [than] Chalcad and Darala the son of Mal.
011	1KI	004	032	And Solomon spoke three thousand proverbs, and his songs were five thousand.
011	1KI	004	033	And he spoke of trees, from the cedar in Libanus even to the hyssop which comes out through the wall: he spoke also of cattle, and of birds, and of reptiles, and of fishes.
011	1KI	004	034	And all the nations came to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and [ambassadors] from all the kings of the earth, as many as heard of his wisdom. And Solomon took to himself the daughter of Pharao to wife, and brought her into the city of David until he had finished the house of the Lord, and his own house, and the wall of Jerusalem. Then went up Pharao the king of Egypt, and took Gazer, and burnt it and the Chananite dwelling in Mergab; and Pharao gave them as a dowry to his daughter the wife of Solomon: and Solomon rebuilt Gazer.
011	1KI	005	001	And Chiram king of Tyre sent his servants to anoint Solomon in the room of David his father, because Chiram always loved David.
011	1KI	005	002	And Solomon sent to Chiram, saying,
011	1KI	005	003	Thou knewest my father David, that he could not build a house to the name of the Lord my God because of the wars that compassed him about, until the Lord put them under the soles of his feet.
011	1KI	005	004	And now the Lord my God has given me rest round about; there is no one plotting against [me], and there is no evil trespass [against me].
011	1KI	005	005	And, behold, I intend to build a house to the name of the Lord my God, as the Lord God spoke to my father David, saying, Thy son whom I will set on thy throne in thy place, he shall build a house to my name.
011	1KI	005	006	And now command, and let [men] cut wood for me out of Libanus: and, behold, my servants [shall be] with thy servants, and I will give thee the wages of thy service, according to all that thou shalt say, because thou knowest that we have no one skilled in cutting timber like the Sidonians.
011	1KI	005	007	And it came to pass, as soon as Chiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed [be] God to-day, who has given to David a wise son over this numerous people.
011	1KI	005	008	And he sent to Solomon, saying, I have listened concerning all that thou hast sent to me for: I will do all thy will: [as for] timber of cedar and fir,
011	1KI	005	009	my servants shall bring them down from Libanus to the sea: I will form them [into] rafts, [and bring them] to the place which thou shalt send to me [about]; and I will land them there, and thou shalt take [them] up: and thou shalt do my will, in giving bread to my household.
011	1KI	005	010	So Chiram gave to Solomon cedars, and fir trees, and all his desire.
011	1KI	005	011	And Solomon gave to Chiram twenty thousand measures of wheat as food for his house, and twenty thousand baths of beaten oil thus Solomon gave to Chiram yearly.
011	1KI	005	012	And the Lord gave wisdom to Solomon as he promised him; and there was peace between Chiram and Solomon, and they made a covenant between them.
011	1KI	005	013	And the king raised a levy out of all Israel, and the levy was thirty thousand men.
011	1KI	005	014	And he sent them to Libanus, ten thousand taking turn every month: they were a month in Libanus and two months at home: and Adoniram [was] over the levy.
011	1KI	005	015	And Solomon had seventy thousand bearers of burdens, and eighty thousand hewers of stone in the mountain;
011	1KI	005	016	besides the rulers that were appointed over the works of Solomon, [there were] three thousand six hundred masters who wrought in the works.
011	1KI	005	017	[And the king commanded and they] [brought great stones, precious stones for the foundation of the house, and unhewn stones.]
011	1KI	005	018	And they prepared the stones and the timber [during] three years.
011	1KI	006	001	And it came to pass in the four hundred and fortieth year after the departure of the children of Israel out of Egypt, in the fourth year and second month of the reign of king Solomon over Israel, that the king commanded that they should take great [and] costly stones for the foundation of the house, and hewn stones. And the men of Solomon, and the men of Chiram hewed [the stones], and laid them [for a foundation]. In the fourth year he laid the foundation of the house of the Lord, in the month Ziu, even in the second month. In the eleventh year, in the month Baal, this [is] the eighth month, the house was completed according to all its plan, and according to all its arrangement.
011	1KI	006	002	And the house which the king built to the Lord [was] forty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and its height five and twenty cubits.
011	1KI	006	003	And the porch in front of the temple—twenty cubits [was] its length according to the breadth of the house in front of the house: and he built the house, and finished it.
011	1KI	006	004	And he made to the house secret windows inclining inward.
011	1KI	006	005	And against the wall of the house he set chambers round about the temple and the ark.
011	1KI	006	006	The under side [was] five cubits broad, and the middle [part] six, and the third [was] seven cubits broad; for he formed an interval to the house round about without the house, that they might not touch the walls of the house.
011	1KI	006	007	And the house was built in the construction of it with rough hewn stones: and there was not heard in the house in the building of it hammer or axe, or any iron tool.
011	1KI	006	008	And the porch of the under side [was] below the right wing of the house, and [there was] a winding ascent into the middle [chamber], and from the middle to the third story.
011	1KI	006	009	So he built the house and finished it; and he made the ceiling of the house with cedars.
011	1KI	006	010	And he made the partitions through all the house, each five cubits high, and enclosed each partition with cedar boards.
011	1KI	006	015	And he framed the walls of the house within with cedar boards, from the floor of the house and on to the inner walls and to the beams: he lined the parts enclosed with boards within, and compassed the inward parts of the house with planks of fir.
011	1KI	006	016	And he built the twenty cubits from the top of the wall, one side from the floor to the beams, and he made it from the oracle to the most holy place.
011	1KI	006	017	And the temple was forty cubits [in extent],
011	1KI	006	019	in front of the oracle in the midst of the house within, [in order] to put there the ark of the covenant of the Lord.
011	1KI	006	020	The length [was] twenty cubits, and the breadth [was] twenty cubits, and the height of it was twenty cubits. And he covered it with perfect gold, and he made an altar in front of the oracle, and covered it with gold.
011	1KI	006	021	And he covered the whole house with gold, till he had finished [gilding] the whole house.
011	1KI	006	023	And he made in the oracle two cherubs of ten cubits measured size.
011	1KI	006	024	And the wing of one cherub was five cubits, and his other wing was five cubits; ten cubits from the tip of one wing to the tip of the other wing.
011	1KI	006	025	Thus it was with the other cherub, both were alike finished with one measure.
011	1KI	006	026	And the height of the one cherub [was] ten cubits, and so [was it] with the second cherub.
011	1KI	006	027	And both the cherubs [were] in the midst of the innermost part of the house; and they spread out their wings, and one wing touched the wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings in the midst of the house touched each other.
011	1KI	006	028	And he covered the cherubs with gold.
011	1KI	006	029	He graved all the walls of the house round about with the graving of cherubs, and [he sculptured] palm trees within and without [the house].
011	1KI	006	030	And he covered the floor of the house within and without with gold.
011	1KI	006	031	And for the door-way of the oracle he made doors of juniper wood, [there were] porches in a four-fold way.
011	1KI	006	034	In both the doors [were] planks of fir; the one door had two leaves and their hinges, and the other door had two leaves and turned [on hinges],
011	1KI	006	035	being carved with cherubs, and [there were] palm-trees and open flower-leaves, and it [was] overlaid with gold gilt upon the engraving.
011	1KI	006	036	And he built the inner court, three rows of hewn stones, and a row of wrought cedar round about, and he made the curtain of the court of the porch of the house that was in front of the temple.
011	1KI	007	001	And Solomon built a house for himself in thirteen years.
011	1KI	007	002	And he built the house with the wood of Libanus; its length [was] a hundred cubits, and its breadth [was] fifty cubits, and its height [was] of thirty cubits, and [it was made] with three rows of cedar pillars, and the pillars had side-pieces of cedar.
011	1KI	007	003	And he formed the house with chambers above on the sides of the pillars, and the number of the pillars [was each] row forty and five,
011	1KI	007	004	and [there were] three chambers, and space against space in three rows.
011	1KI	007	005	And all the doors and spaces formed like chambers [were] square, and from door to door [was a correspondence] in three rows.
011	1KI	007	006	And [he made] the porch of the pillars, [they were] fifty [cubits] long and fifty broad, the porch joining them in front; and the [other] pillars and the thick beam [were] in front of the house by the porches.
011	1KI	007	007	And [there was] the Porch of seats where he would judge, the porch of judgment.
011	1KI	007	008	And their house where he would dwell, [had] one court communicating with these according to this work; and [he built] the house for the daughter of Pharao whom Solomon had taken, according to this porch.
011	1KI	007	009	All these [were] of costly stones, sculptured at intervals within even from the foundation even to the top, and outward to the great court,
011	1KI	007	010	founded with large costly stones, stones of ten cubits and eight cubits [long].
011	1KI	007	011	And above with costly stones, according to the measure of hewn stones, and with cedars.
011	1KI	007	012	[There were] three rows of hewn [stones] round about the great hall, and a row of sculptured cedar.
011	1KI	007	013	And king Solomon sent, and took Chiram out of Tyre,
011	1KI	007	014	the son of a widow woman; and he [was] of the tribe of Nephthalim, and his father [was] a Tyrian; a worker in brass, and accomplished in art and skill and knowledge to work every work in brass: and he was brought in to king Solomon, and he wrought all the works.
011	1KI	007	015	And he cast the two pillars for the porch of the house: eighteen cubits [was] the height of [each] pillar, and a circumference of fourteen cubits encompassed it, even the thickness of the pillar: the flutings [were] four fingers [wide], and thus [was] the other pillar [formed].
011	1KI	007	016	And he made two molten chapiters to put on the heads of the pillars: five cubits [was] the height of one chapiter, and five cubits [was] the height of the other chapiter.
011	1KI	007	017	And he made two ornaments of net-work to cover the chapiters of the pillars; even a net for one chapiter, and a net for the other chapiter.
011	1KI	007	018	And hanging work, two rows of brazen pomegranates, formed with net-work, hanging work, row upon row: and thus he framed [the ornaments] for the second chapiter. And he set up the pillars of the porch of the temple: and he set up the one pillar, and called its name Jachum: and he set up the second pillar, and called its name Boloz.
011	1KI	007	019	And on the heads of the pillars he made lily-work against the porch, of four cubits,
011	1KI	007	020	and a chamber over both the pillars, and above the sides an addition [equal to] the chamber in width.
011	1KI	007	023	And he made the sea, ten cubits from one rim to the other, the same was completely circular round about: its height [was] five cubits, and its circumference thirty-three cubits.
011	1KI	007	024	And stays underneath its rim round about compassed it ten cubits round;
011	1KI	007	025	And [there were] twelve oxen under the sea: three looking to the north, and three looking to the west, and three looking to the south, and three looking to the east: and all their hinder parts [were] inward, and the sea [was] above upon them.
011	1KI	007	026	and its rim [was] as the work of the rim of a cup, a lily-flower, and the thickness of it [was] a span.
011	1KI	007	027	And he made ten brazen bases: five cubits [was] the length of one base, and four cubits the breadth of it, and its height [was] six cubits.
011	1KI	007	028	And this work of the bases [was] formed with a border the them, and [there was] a border between the ledges.
011	1KI	007	029	And upon their borders between the projection [were] lions, and oxen, and cherubs: and on the projections, even so above, and also below [were] the places of lions and oxen, hanging work.
011	1KI	007	030	And [there were] four brazen wheels to one base; and [there were] brazen bases, and their four sides [answering to them], side pieces under the bases.
011	1KI	007	031	And [there were] axles in the wheels under the base.
011	1KI	007	032	And the height of one wheel [was] a cubit and a half.
011	1KI	007	033	And the work of the wheels [was] as the work of chariot wheels: their axles, and their felloes, and [the rest of] their work, [were] all molten.
011	1KI	007	034	The four side pieces were at the four corners of each base; its shoulders [were formed] of the base.
011	1KI	007	035	And on the top of the base half a cubit [was] the size of it, [there was] a circle on the top of the base, and [there was] the top of its spaces and its borders: and it was open at the top of its spaces.
011	1KI	007	036	And its borders [were] cherubs, and lions, and palm-trees, upright, each [was] joined in front [and] within and round about.
011	1KI	007	037	According to the same form he made all the ten bases, [even] one order and one measure to all.
011	1KI	007	038	And he made ten brazen lavers, each laver containing forty baths, [and] measuring four cubits, each laver [placed] on a several base throughout the ten bases.
011	1KI	007	039	And he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house: and the sea was placed on the right side of the house eastward in the direction of the south.
011	1KI	007	040	And Chiram made the caldrons, and the pans, and the bowls; and Chiram finished making all the works that he wrought for king Solomon in the house of the Lord:
011	1KI	007	041	two pillars and the wreathen works of the pillars on the heads of the two pillars; and the two net-works to cover both the wreathen works of the flutings that were upon the pillars.
011	1KI	007	042	The four hundred pomegranates for both the net-works, two rows of pomegranates for one net-work, to cover both the wreathen works of the bases belonging to both pillars.
011	1KI	007	043	And the ten bases, and the ten lavers upon the bases.
011	1KI	007	044	And one sea, and the twelve oxen under the sea.
011	1KI	007	045	And the caldrons, and pans, and bowls, and all the furniture, which Chiram made for king Solomon for the house of the Lord: and [there were] eight and forty pillars of the house of the king and of the house of the Lord: all the works of the king which Chiram made were entirely of brass.
011	1KI	007	047	There was no reckoning of the brass of which he made all these works, from the very great abundance, there was no end of the weight of the brass. In the country round about Jordan did he cast them, in the clay land between Socchoth and Sira.
011	1KI	007	048	And king Solomon took the furniture which [Chiram] made for the house of the Lord, the golden altar, and the golden table of shewbread.
011	1KI	007	049	And [he put] the five candlesticks on the left, and five on the right in front of the oracle, [being] of pure gold, and the lamp-stands, and the lamps, and the snuffers of gold.
011	1KI	007	050	And [there were made] the porches, and the nails, and the bowls, and the spoons, and the golden censers, of pure gold: and the panels of the doors of the innermost part of the house, [even] the holy of holies, and the golden doors of the temple.
011	1KI	007	051	So the work of the house of the Lord which Solomon wrought was finished; and Solomon brought in the holy things of David his father, and all the holy things of Solomon; he put the silver, and the gold, and the furniture, into the treasures of the house of the Lord. And Solomon built a house for himself in thirteen years. And he built the house with the wood of Libanus; its length [was] a hundred cubits, and its breadth [was] fifty cubits, and its height [was] of thirty cubits, and [it was made] with three rows of cedar pillars, and the pillars had side-pieces of cedar. And he formed the house with chambers above on the sides of the pillars, and the number of the pillars [was each] row forty and five, and [there were] three chambers, and space against space in three rows. And all the doors and spaces formed like chambers [were] square, and from door to door [was a correspondence] in three rows. And [he made] the porch of the pillars, [they were] fifty [cubits] long and fifty broad, the porch joining them in front; and the [other] pillars and the thick beam [were] in front of the house by the porches. And [there was] the Porch of seats where he would judge, the porch of judgment. And their house where he would dwell, [had] one court communicating with these according to this work; and [he built] the house for the daughter of Pharao whom Solomon had taken, according to this porch. All these [were] of costly stones, sculptured at intervals within even from the foundation even to the top, and outward to the great court, founded with large costly stones, stones of ten cubits and eight cubits [long]. And above with costly stones, according to the measure of hewn stones, and with cedars. [There were] three rows of hewn [stones] round about the great hall, and a row of sculptured cedar: and Solomon finished all his house.
011	1KI	008	001	And it came to pass when Solomon had finished building the house of the Lord and his own house after twenty years, then king Solomon assembled all the elders of Israel in Sion, to bring the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of the city of David, this is Sion,
011	1KI	008	002	in the month of Athanin.
011	1KI	008	003	And the priests took up the ark,
011	1KI	008	004	and the tabernacle of testimony, and the holy furniture that was in the tabernacle of testimony.
011	1KI	008	005	And the king and all Israel [were occupied] before the ark, sacrificing sheep [and] oxen, without number.
011	1KI	008	006	And the priests bring in the ark into its place, into the oracle of the house, even into the holy of holies, under the wings of the cherubs.
011	1KI	008	007	For the cherubs spread out their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubs covered the ark and its holy things above.
011	1KI	008	008	And the holy staves projected, and the ends of the holy staves appeared out of the holy places in front of the oracle, and were not seen without.
011	1KI	008	009	There was nothing in the ark except the two tables of stone, the tables of the covenant which Moses put [there] in Choreb, which [tables] the Lord made [as a covenant] with the children of Israel in their going forth from the land of Egypt.
011	1KI	008	010	And it came to pass when the priests departed out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house.
011	1KI	008	011	And the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud, because the glory of the Lord filled the house.
011	1KI	008	014	And the king turned his face, and the king blessed all Israel, (and the whole assembly of Israel stood:)
011	1KI	008	015	and he said, Blessed [be] the Lord God of Israel to-day, who spoke by his mouth concerning David my father, and has fulfilled it with his hands, saying,
011	1KI	008	016	From the day that I brought out my people Israel out of Egypt, I have not chosen a city in [any] one tribe of Israel to build a house, so that my name should be there: but I chose Jerusalem that my name should be there, and I chose David to be over my people Israel.
011	1KI	008	017	And it was in the heart of my father to build a house to the name of the Lord God of Israel.
011	1KI	008	018	And the Lord said to David my father, Forasmuch as it came into thine heart to build a house to my name, thou didst well that it came upon thine heart.
011	1KI	008	019	Nevertheless thou shalt not build the house, but thy son that has proceeded out of thy bowels, he shall build the house to my name.
011	1KI	008	020	And the Lord has confirmed the word that he spoke, and I am risen up in the place of my father David, and I have sat down on the throne of Israel, as the Lord spoke, and I have built the house to the name of the Lord God of Israel.
011	1KI	008	021	And I have set there a place for the ark, in which is the covenant of the Lord, which the Lord made with our fathers, when he brought them out of the land of Egypt.
011	1KI	008	022	And Solomon stood up in front of the altar before all the congregation of Israel; and he spread out his hands toward heaven:
011	1KI	008	023	and he said, Lord God of Israel, there is no God like thee in heaven above and on the earth beneath, keeping covenant and mercy with thy servant who walks before thee with all his heart;
011	1KI	008	024	which thou hast kept toward thy servant David my father: for thou hast spoken by thy mouth and thou hast fulfilled it with thine hands, as [at] this day.
011	1KI	008	025	And now, O Lord God of Israel, keep for thy servant David my father, [the promises] which thou hast spoken to him, saying, There shall not be taken from thee a man sitting before me on the throne of Israel, provided only thy children shall take heed to their ways, to walk before me as thou hast walked before me.
011	1KI	008	026	And now, O Lord God of Israel, let, I pray thee, thy word to David my father be confirmed.
011	1KI	008	027	But will God indeed dwell with men upon the earth? if the heaven and heaven of heavens will not suffice thee, how much less even this house which I have built to thy name?
011	1KI	008	028	Yet, O Lord God of Israel, thou shalt look upon my petition, to hear the prayer which thy servant prays to thee in thy presence this day,
011	1KI	008	029	that thine eyes may be open toward this house day and night, even toward the place which thou saidst, My name shall be there, to hear the prayer which thy servant prays at this place day and night.
011	1KI	008	030	And thou shalt hearken to the prayer of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, which they shall pray toward this place; and thou shalt hear in thy dwelling-place in heaven, and thou shalt do and be gracious.
011	1KI	008	031	Whatsoever trespasses any [one] shall commit against his neighbour, —and if he shall take upon him an oath so that he should swear, and he shall come and make confession before thine altar in this house,
011	1KI	008	032	then shalt thou hear from heaven, and do, and thou shalt judge thy people Israel, that the wicked should be condemned, to recompense his way upon his head; and to justify the righteous, to give to him according to his righteousness.
011	1KI	008	033	When thy people Israel falls before enemies, because they shall sin against thee, and they shall return and confess to thy name, and they shall pray and supplicate in this house,
011	1KI	008	034	then shalt thou hear from heaven, and be gracious to the sins of thy people Israel, and thou shalt restore them to the land which thou gavest to their fathers.
011	1KI	008	035	When the heaven is restrained, and there is no rain, because they shall sin against thee, and the shall pray toward this place, and they shall make confession to thy name, and shall turn from their sins when thou shalt have humbled them,
011	1KI	008	036	then thou shalt hear from heaven, and be merciful to the sins of thy servant and of thy people Israel; for thou shalt shew them the good way to walk in it, and thou shalt give rain upon the earth which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance.
011	1KI	008	037	If there should be famine, if there should be death, because there should be blasting, locust, or if there be mildew, and if their enemy oppress them in [any] one of their cities, [with regard to] every calamity, every trouble,
011	1KI	008	038	every prayer, every supplication whatever shall be made by any man, as they shall know each the plague of his heart, and shall spread abroad his hands to this house,
011	1KI	008	039	then shalt thou hearken from heaven, out of thine established dwelling-place, and shalt be merciful, and shalt do, and recompense to [every] man according to his ways, as thou shalt know his heart, for thou alone knowest the heart of all the children of men:
011	1KI	008	040	that they may fear thee all the days that they live upon the land, which thou hast given to our fathers.
011	1KI	008	041	And for the stranger who is not of thy people,
011	1KI	008	042	when they shall come and pray toward this place,
011	1KI	008	043	then shalt thou hear [them] from heaven, out of thine established dwelling-place, and thou shalt do according to all that the stranger shall call upon thee for, that all the nations may know thy name, and fear thee, as [do] thy people Israel, and may know that thy name has been called on this house which I have builded.
011	1KI	008	044	[If it be] that thy people shall go forth to war against their enemies in the way by which thou shalt turn them, and pray in the name of the Lord toward the city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built to thy name,
011	1KI	008	045	then shalt thou hear from heaven their supplication and their prayer, and shalt execute judgment for them.
011	1KI	008	046	[If it be] that they shall sin against thee, (for there is not a man who will not sin,) and thou shalt bring them and deliver them up before their enemies, and they that take [them] captive shall carry [them] to a land far or near,
011	1KI	008	047	and they shall turn their hearts in the land whither they have been carried captives, and turn in the land of their sojourning, and supplicate thee, saying, We have sinned, we have done unjustly, we have transgressed,
011	1KI	008	048	and they shall turn to thee with all their heart, and with all their soul, in the land of their enemies whither thou hast carried them captives, and shall pray to thee toward their land which thou hast given to their fathers, and the city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built to thy name:
011	1KI	008	049	then shalt thou hear from heaven thine established dwelling-place,
011	1KI	008	050	and thou shalt be merciful to their unrighteousness wherein they have trespassed against thee, and according to all their transgressions wherewith they have transgressed against thee, and thou shalt cause them to be pitied before them that carried them captives, and they shall have compassion on them:
011	1KI	008	051	for [they are] thy people and thine inheritance, whom thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, out of the midst of the furnace of iron.
011	1KI	008	052	And let thine eyes and thine ears be opened to the supplication of thy servant, and to the supplication of thy people Israel, to hearken to them in all things for which they shall call upon thee.
011	1KI	008	053	Because thou hast set them apart for an inheritance to thyself out of all the nations of the earth, as thou spokest by the hand of thy servant Moses, when thou broughtest our fathers out of the land of Egypt, O Lord God.—Then spoke Solomon concerning the house, when he had finished building it—He manifested the sun in the heaven: the Lord said he would dwell in darkness: build thou my house, a beautiful house for thyself to dwell in anew. Behold, is not this written in the book of the song?
011	1KI	008	054	And it came to pass when Solomon had finished praying to the Lord all this prayer and supplication, that he rose up from before the altar of the Lord, [after] having knelt upon his knees, and his hands [were] spread out towards heaven.
011	1KI	008	055	And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a loud voice, saying,
011	1KI	008	056	Blessed [be] the Lord this day, who has given rest to his people Israel, according to all that he said: there has not failed one word among all his good words which he spoke by the hand of his servant Moses.
011	1KI	008	057	May the Lord our God be with us, as he was with our fathers; let him not desert us nor turn from us,
011	1KI	008	058	that he may turn our hearts toward him to walk in all his ways, and to keep all his commandments, and his ordinances which he commanded our fathers.
011	1KI	008	059	And let these words, which I have prayed before the Lord our God, [be] near to the Lord our God day and night, to maintain the cause of thy servant, and the cause of thy people Israel for ever.
011	1KI	008	060	that all the nations of the earth may know that the Lord God, he [is] God, and there is none beside.
011	1KI	008	061	And let our hearts be perfect toward the Lord our God, to walk also holily in his ordinances, and to keep his commandments, as at this day.
011	1KI	008	062	And the king and all the children of Israel offered sacrifice before the Lord.
011	1KI	008	063	And king Solomon offered for the sacrifices of peace-offering which he sacrificed to the Lord, two and twenty thousand oxen, and hundred and twenty thousand sheep: and the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the Lord.
011	1KI	008	064	In that day the king consecrated the middle of the court in the front of the house of the Lord; for there he offered the whole-burnt-offering, and the sacrifices, and the fat of the peace-offerings, because the brazen altar which was before the Lord [was too] little to bear the whole-burnt-offering and the sacrifices of peace-offerings.
011	1KI	008	065	And Solomon kept the feast in that day, and all Israel with him, even a great assembly from the entering in of Hemath to the river of Egypt, before the Lord our God in the house which he built, eating and drinking, and rejoicing before the Lord our God seven days.
011	1KI	008	066	And on the eighth day he sent away the people: and they blessed the king, and each departed to his tabernacle rejoicing, and [their] heart [was] glad because of the good things which the Lord had done to his servant David, and to Israel his people.
011	1KI	009	001	And it came to pass when Solomon had finished building the house of the Lord, and the king's house, and all the work of Solomon, whatever he wished to perform,
011	1KI	009	002	that the Lord appeared to Solomon a second time, as he appeared in Gabaon.
011	1KI	009	003	And the Lord said to him, I have heard the voice of thy prayer, and thy supplication which thou madest before me: I have done for thee according to all thy prayer: I have hallowed this house which thou hast built to put my name there for ever, and mine eyes and my heart shall be there always.
011	1KI	009	004	And if thou wilt walk before me as David thy father walked, in holiness of heart and uprightness, and so as to do according to all that I commanded him, and shalt keep my ordinances and my commandments:
011	1KI	009	005	then will I establish the throne of thy kingdom in Israel for ever, as I spoke to David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man to rule in Israel.
011	1KI	009	006	But if ye or your children do in any wise revolt from me, and do not keep my commandments and my ordinances, which Moses set before you, and ye go and serve other gods, and worship them:
011	1KI	009	007	then will I cut off Israel from the land which I have given them, and this house which I have consecrated to my name I will cast out of my sight; and Israel shall be a desolation and a by-word to all nations.
011	1KI	009	008	And this house, which is high, shall be [so that] every one that passes by it shall be amazed, and shall hiss; and they shall say, Wherefore has the Lord done thus to this land, and to this house?
011	1KI	009	009	And [men] shall say, Because they forsook the Lord their God, who brought out their fathers from Egypt, out of the house of bondage, and they attached themselves to strange gods, and worshipped them, and served them: therefore the Lord has brought this evil upon them. Then Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharao out of the city of David into his house which he built for himself in those days.
011	1KI	009	010	[During] twenty years in which Solomon was building the two houses, the house of the Lord, and the house of the king,
011	1KI	009	011	Chiram king of Tyre helped Solomon with cedar wood, and fir wood, and with gold, and all that he wished for: then the king gave Chiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.
011	1KI	009	012	So Chiram departed from Tyre, and went into Galilee to see the cities which Solomon gave to him; and they pleased him not. And he said,
011	1KI	009	013	What [are] these cities which thou hast given me, brother? And he called them Boundary until this day.
011	1KI	009	014	And Chiram brought to Solomon a hundred and twenty talents of gold,
011	1KI	009	026	even that for which king Solomon built a ship in Gasion Gaber near Aelath on the shore of the extremity of the sea in the land of Edom.
011	1KI	009	027	And Chiram sent in the ship together with the servants of Solomon servants of his own, mariners to row, men acquainted with the sea.
011	1KI	009	028	And they came to Sophira, and took thence a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and brought them to king Solomon.
011	1KI	010	001	And the queen of Saba heard of the name of Solomon, and the name of the Lord, and she came to try him with riddles.
011	1KI	010	002	And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train; and [there came] camels bearing spices, and very much gold, and precious stones: and she came in to Solomon, and told him all that was in her heart.
011	1KI	010	003	And Solomon answered all her questions: and there was not a question overlooked by the king which he did not answer her.
011	1KI	010	004	And the queen of Saba saw all the wisdom of Solomon, and the house which he built,
011	1KI	010	005	and the provision of Solomon and the sitting of his attendants, and the standing of his servants, and his raiment, and his cup-bearers, and his whole-burnt-offering which he offered in the house of the Lord, and she was utterly amazed.
011	1KI	010	006	And she said to king Solomon, [It was] a true report which I heard in my land of thy words and thy wisdom.
011	1KI	010	007	But I believed not them that told me, until I came and my eyes saw: and, behold, the words as they reported to me are not the half: thou hast exceeded in goodness all the report which I heard in my land.
011	1KI	010	008	Blessed [are] thy wives, blessed [are] these thy servants who stand before thee continually, who hear all thy wisdom.
011	1KI	010	009	Blessed be the Lord thy God, who has taken pleasure in thee, to set thee upon the throne of Israel, because the Lord loved Israel to establish [him] for ever; and he has made thee king over them, to execute judgment with justice, and in their causes.
011	1KI	010	010	And she gave to Solomon a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and very many spices, and precious stones: there had not come any other spices so abundant as those which the queen of Saba gave to king Solomon.
011	1KI	010	011	And the ship of Chiram which brought the gold from Suphir, brought very much hewn timber and precious stones.
011	1KI	010	012	And the king made the hewn timber [into] buttresses of the house of the Lord and the king's house, and lyres and harps for singers: such hewn timber had not come upon the earth, nor have been seen anywhere until this day.
011	1KI	010	013	And king Solomon gave to the queen of Saba all that she desired, whatsoever she asked, besides all that he had given her by the hand of king Solomon: and she returned, and came into her own land, she and her servants.
011	1KI	010	014	And the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold.
011	1KI	010	015	Besides the tributes of them that were subjects, both merchants and all the kings of the [country] beyond [the river], and of the princess of the land.
011	1KI	010	016	And Solomon made three hundred spears of beaten gold: three hundred shekels of gold were upon one spear.
011	1KI	010	017	And three hundred shields of beaten gold: and three pounds of gold were in one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.
011	1KI	010	018	And the king made a great ivory throne, and gilded it with pure gold.
011	1KI	010	019	The throne [had] six steps, and calves in bold relief to the throne behind it, and side-pieces on either hand of the place of the seat, and two lions standing by the side-pieces,
011	1KI	010	020	and twelve lions standing there on the six steps on either side: it was not so done in any [other] kingdom.
011	1KI	010	021	And all the vessels made by Solomon [were] of gold, and the lavers [were] golden, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold; there was no silver, for it was not accounted of in the days of Solomon.
011	1KI	010	022	For Solomon had a ship of Tharsis in the sea with the ships of Chiram: one ship came to the king every three years out of Tharsis, [laden with] gold and silver, and wrought stones, and hewn stones. This was the arrangement of the provision which king Solomon fetched to build the house of the Lord, and the house of the king, and the wall of Jerusalem, and the citadel; to fortify the city of David, and Assur, and Magdal, and Gazer, and Baethoron the upper, and Jethermath, and all the cities of the chariots, and all the cities of the horsemen, and the fortification of Solomon which he purposed to build in Jerusalem and in all the land, so that none of the people should rule over him that was left of the Chettite and the Amorite, and the Pherezite, and the Chananite, and the Evite, and the Jebusite, and the Gergesite, who were not of the children of Israel, their descendants who had been left with him in the land, whom the children of Israel could not utterly destroy; and Solomon made them tributaries until this day. But of the children of Israel Solomon made nothing; for they were the warriors, and his servants and rulers, and captains of the third order, and the captains of his chariots, and his horsemen.
011	1KI	010	023	And Solomon increased beyond all the kings of the earth in wealth and wisdom.
011	1KI	010	024	And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom which the Lord [had] put into his heart.
011	1KI	010	025	And they brought every one their gifts, vessels of gold, and raiment, and stacte, and spices, and horses, and mules, a rate year by year.
011	1KI	010	026	And Solomon had four thousand mares for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen: and he put them in the cities of his chariots, and with the king in Jerusalem: and he ruled over all the kings from the river to the land of the Philistines, and to the borders of Egypt.
011	1KI	010	027	And the king made gold and silver in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedars as the sycamores in the plain for multitude.
011	1KI	010	028	And the goings forth of Solomon's horsemen [was] also out of Egypt, and the king's merchants [were] of Thecue; and they received them out of Thecue at a price.
011	1KI	010	029	And that which proceeded out of Egypt went up [thus, even] a chariot for a hundred [shekels] of silver, and a horse for fifty [shekels] of silver: and thus for all the kings of the Chettians, and the kings of Syria, they came out by sea.
011	1KI	011	001	And king Solomon was a lover of women. And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines. And he took strange women, as well as the daughter of Pharao, Moabitish, Ammanitish women, Syrians and Idumeans, Chettites, and Amorites;
011	1KI	011	002	of the nations concerning whom the Lord forbade the children of Israel, [saying], Ye shall not go in to them, and they shall not come in to you, lest they turn away your hearts after their idols: Solomon clave to these in love.
011	1KI	011	004	And it came to pass in the time of the old age of Solomon, that his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God, as [was] the heart of David his father. And the strange women turned away his heart after their gods. Then Solomon built a high place to Chamos the idol of Moab, and to their king the idol of the children of Ammon,
011	1KI	011	005	and to Astarte the abomination of the Sidonians.
011	1KI	011	006	And thus he acted towards all his strange wives, who burnt incense and sacrificed to their idols. And Solomon did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord: he went not after the Lord, as David his father.
011	1KI	011	009	And the Lord was angry with Solomon, because he turned away his heart from the Lord God of Israel, who had appeared twice to him,
011	1KI	011	010	and charged him concerning this matter, by no means to go after other gods, but to take heed to do what the Lord God commanded him; neither was his heart perfect with the Lord, according to the heart of David his father.
011	1KI	011	011	And the Lord said to Solomon, Because it has been thus with thee, and thou hast not kept my commandments and my ordinances which I commanded thee, I will surely rend thy kingdom out of thy hand, and give it to thy servant.
011	1KI	011	012	Only in thy days I will not do it for David thy father's sake: [but] I will take it out of the hand of thy son.
011	1KI	011	013	Only I will not take away the whole kingdom: I will give one tribe to thy son for David my servant's sake, and for the sake of Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen.
011	1KI	011	014	And the Lord raised up an enemy to Solomon, Ader the Idumaean, and Esrom son of Eliadae who [dwelt] in Raama, [and] Adadezer king of Suba his master; (and men gathered to him, and he was head of the conspiracy, and he seized on Damasec,) and they were adversaries to Israel all the days of Solomon: and Ader the Idumaean [was] of the seed royal in Idumaea.
011	1KI	011	015	And it happened, that while David was utterly destroying Edom, while Joab captain of the host was going to bury the dead, when they slew every male in Idumaea;
011	1KI	011	016	(for Joab and all Israel abode there six months in Idumaea, until he utterly destroyed every male in Idumaea;)
011	1KI	011	017	that Ader ran away, he and all the Idumaeans of the servants of his father with him; and they went into Egypt; and Ader [was then] a little child.
011	1KI	011	018	And there rise up men out of the city of Madiam, and they come to Pharan, and take men with them, and come to Pharao king of Egypt: and Ader went in to Pharao, and he gave him a house, and appointed him provision.
011	1KI	011	019	And Ader found great favour in the sight of Pharao, and he gave him his wife's sister in marriage, the elder sister of Thekemina.
011	1KI	011	020	And the sister of Thekemina bore to him, [even] to Ader, Ganebath her son; and Thekemina brought him up in the midst of the sons of Pharao, and Ganebath was in the midst of the sons of Pharao.
011	1KI	011	021	And Ader heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host was dead; and Ader said to Pharao, Let me go, and I will return to my country.
011	1KI	011	022	And Pharao said to Ader, What lackest thou with me? that lo! thou seekest to depart to thy country? and Ader said to him, By all means let me go.
011	1KI	011	023	So Ader returned to his country; this [is] the mischief which Ader did, and he was a bitter enemy of Israel, and he reigned in the land of Edom.
011	1KI	011	026	And Jeroboam the son of Nabat, the Ephrathite of Sarira, the son of a widow, [was] servant of Solomon.
011	1KI	011	027	And this [was] the occasion of his lifting up [his] hands against king Solomon: now king Solomon built the citadel, he completed the fortification of the city of David his father.
011	1KI	011	028	And the man Jeroboam was very strong; and Solomon saw the young man that he was active, and he set him over the levies of the house of Joseph.
011	1KI	011	029	And it came to pass at that time, that Jeroboam went forth from Jerusalem, and Achia the Selonite the prophet found him in the way, and caused him to turn aside out of the way: and Achia was clad with a new garment, and they two [were] alone in the field.
011	1KI	011	030	And Achia laid hold of his new garment that was upon him, and tore it [into] twelve pieces:
011	1KI	011	031	and he said to Jeroboam, Take to thyself ten pieces, for thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Behold, I rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give thee ten tribes.
011	1KI	011	032	Yet he shall have two tribes, for my servant David's sake, and for the sake of Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel.
011	1KI	011	033	Because he forsook me, and sacrificed to Astarte the abomination of the Sidonians, and to Chamos, and to the idols of Moab, and to their king the abomination of the children of Ammon, and he walked not in my ways, to do that which was right before me, as David his father [did].
011	1KI	011	034	Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand, (for I will certainly resist him all the days of his life,) for David my servant's sake, whom I have chosen.
011	1KI	011	035	But I will take the kingdom out of the hand of his son, and give thee ten tribes.
011	1KI	011	036	But to his son I will give the two [remaining] tribes, that my servant David may have an establishment continually before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen for myself to put my name there.
011	1KI	011	037	And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign as thy soul desires, and thou shalt be king over Israel.
011	1KI	011	038	And it shall come to pass, if thou wilt keep all the commandments that I shall give thee, and wilt walk in my ways, and do that which is right before me, to keep my ordinances and my commandments, as David my servant did, that I will be with thee, and will build thee a sure house, as I built to David.
011	1KI	011	040	And Solomon sought to slay Jeroboam: but he arose and fled into Egypt, to Susakim king of Egypt, and he was in Egypt until Solomon died.
011	1KI	011	041	And the rest of the history of Solomon, and all that he did, and all his wisdom, behold are not these things written in the book of the life of Solomon?
011	1KI	011	042	And the days [during] which Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel [were] forty years.
011	1KI	011	043	And Solomon slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David his father. And it came to pass when Jeroboam son of Nabat heard [of it], even while he was yet in Egypt as he fled from the face of Solomon and dwelt in Egypt, he straightway comes into his own city, into the land of Sarira in the mount of Ephraim. And king Solomon slept with his fathers, and Roboam his son reigned in his stead.
011	1KI	012	001	And king Roboam goes to Sikima; for all Israel were coming to Sikima to make him king.
011	1KI	012	003	And the people spoke to king Roboam, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy;
011	1KI	012	004	but do thou now lighten somewhat of the hard service of thy father, and of his heavy yoke which he put upon us, and we will serve thee.
011	1KI	012	005	And he said to them, Depart for three days, and return to me. And they departed.
011	1KI	012	006	And the king referred [the matter] to the elders, who stood before Solomon his father while he was yet living, saying, How do ye advise that I should answer this people?
011	1KI	012	007	And they spoke to him, saying, If thou wilt this day be a servant to this people, and wilt serve them, and wilt speak to them good words, then will they be thy servants continually.
011	1KI	012	008	But he forsook the counsel of the old men which they gave him, and consulted with the young men who were brought up with him, who stood in his presence.
011	1KI	012	009	And he said to them, What counsel do ye give? And what shall I answer to this people who speak to me, saying, Lighten somewhat of the yoke which thy father has put upon us?
011	1KI	012	010	And the young men who had been brought up with him, who stood before his face, spoke to him, saying, Thus shalt thou say to this people who have spoken to thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, and do thou now lighten it from off us: thus shalt say to them, My little [finger shall be] thicker than my father's loins.
011	1KI	012	011	And whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I also will add to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.
011	1KI	012	012	And all Israel came to king Roboam on the third day, as the king spoke to them, saying, Return to me on the third day.
011	1KI	012	013	And the king answered the people harshly; and Roboam forsook the counsel of the old men which they counselled him.
011	1KI	012	014	And he spoke to them according to the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, and I will add to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.
011	1KI	012	015	And the king hearkened not to the people, because the change was from the Lord, that he might establish his word which he spoke by Achia the Selonite concerning Jeroboam the son of Nabat.
011	1KI	012	016	And all Israel saw that the king did not hearken to them: and the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? neither have we any inheritance in the son of Jessae. Depart, O Israel, to thy tents: now feed thine own house, David. So Israel departed to his tents.
011	1KI	012	018	And the king sent Adoniram who was over the tribute; and they stoned him with stones, and he died: and king Roboam made haste to rise to flee to Jerusalem.
011	1KI	012	019	So Israel rebelled against the house of David until this day.
011	1KI	012	020	And it came to pass when all Israel heard that Jeroboam had returned out of Egypt, that they sent and called him to the assembly, and they made him king over Israel: and none followed the house of David except the tribe of Juda and Benjamin only.
011	1KI	012	021	And Roboam went into Jerusalem, and he assembled the congregation of Juda, and the tribe of Benjamin, a hundred and twenty thousand young men, warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to recover the kingdom to Roboam the son of Solomon.
011	1KI	012	022	And the word of the Lord came to Samaia the man of God, saying,
011	1KI	012	023	Speak to Roboam the son of Solomon, king of Juda, and to all the house of Juda and Benjamin, and to the remnant of the people, saying,
011	1KI	012	024	Thus saith the Lord, Ye shall not go up, neither shall ye fight with your brethren the sons of Israel: return each man to his own home; for this thing is from me; and they hearkened to the word of the Lord, and they ceased from going up, according to the word of the Lord. So king Solomon sleeps with his fathers, and is buried with his fathers in the city of David; and Roboam his son reigned in his stead in Jerusalem, being sixteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twelve years I Jerusalem: and his mother's name [was] Naanan, daughter of Ana son of Naas king of the children of Ammon. And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, and walked not in the way of David his father. And there was a man of mount Ephraim, a servant to Solomon, and his name was Jeroboam: and the name of his mother was Sarira, a harlot: and Solomon made him head of the levies of the house of Joseph: and he built for Solomon Sarira in mount Ephraim; and he had three hundred chariots of horses: he built the citadel with the levies of the house of Ephraim; he fortified the city of David, and aspired to the kingdom, And Solomon sought to kill him; and he was afraid, and escaped to Susakim king of Egypt, and was with him until Solomon died. And Jeroboam heard in Egypt that Solomon was dead: and he spoke in the ears of Susakim king of Egypt, saying, Let me go, and I will depart into my land: and Susakim said to him, Ask and request, and I will grant it thee. And Susakim gave to Jeroboam Ano the eldest sister of Thekemina his wife: she was great among the daughters of the king, and she bore to Jerobaom Abia his son: and Jeroboam said to Susakim, Let me indeed go, and I will depart. And Jeroboam departed out of Egypt, and came into the land of Saria that was in mount Ephraim, and thither the whole in mount Ephraim, and thither the whole tribe of Ephraim assembles, and Jeroboam built a fortress there. And his young child was sick with a very severe sickness; and Jeroboam went to enquire concerning the child: and he said to Ano his wife, Arise, go, enquire of God concerning the child, whether he shall recover from his sickness. Now there was a man in Selom, an his name [was] Achia: and he was sixty years old, and the word of the Lord was with him. And Jeroboam said to his wife, Arise, and take in thine hand loaves for the man of God, and cakes for his children, and grapes, and a pot of honey. And the woman arose, and took in her hand bread, and two cakes, and grapes, and a pot of honey, for Achia: and the man [was] old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see. And she arose, up from Sarira and went; and it came to pass when she had come into the city to Achia the Selonite, that Achia said to his servant, Go out now to meet Ano the wife of Jeroboam, and thou shalt say to her, Come in, and stand not [still]: for thus saith the Lord, I send grievous tidings to thee. And Ano went in to the man of God; and Achia said to her, Why hast thou brought me bread and grapes, and cakes, and a pot of honey? Thus saith the Lord, Behold, thou shalt depart from me, and it shall come to pass when thou hast entered into the city, [even] into Sarira, that thy maidens shall come out to meet thee, and shall say to thee, The child is dead: for thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will destroy every male of Jeroboam, and there shall be the dead of Jeroboam in the city, [them] the dogs shall eat, and him that eat, and he shall lament for the child, saying, [Woe is me], Lord! For there has been found in him some good thing touching the Lord. And the woman departed, when she heard this: and it came to pass as she entered into Sarira, that the child died; and there came forth a wailing to meet [her]. And Jeroboam went to Sikima in mount Ephraim, and assembled there the tribes of Israel; and Roboam the son of Solomon went up thither. And the word of the Lord came to Samaias son of Enlami, saying, Take to thyself a new garment which has not gone into the water, and rend it into twelve pieces; and thou shalt five some to Jeroboam, and shalt say to him, thus saith the Lord, Take to thyself ten pieces to cover thee: and Jeroboam took [them]: and Samaias said, Thus saith the Lord concerning the ten tribes of Israel. And the people said to Roboam the son of Solomon, Thy father make his yoke heavy upon us, and made the meat of his table heavy; and now thou shalt lighten them upon us, and we will serve thee. And Roboam said to the people, Wait three days, and I will return you an answer: and Roboam said, Bring in to me the elders, and I will take counsel with them what I shall answer to the people on the third day, So Roboam spoke in their ears, as the people sent to him to [say]: and the elders of the people said, Thus the people have spoken to thee. And Roboam rejected their counsel, and it pleased him not: and he sent and brought in those who had been brought up with him; and he said to them, Thus and thus has the people sent to me to say: and they that had been brought up with him said, Thus shalt thou speak to the people saying, My little [finger] shall be thicker than my father's loins; my father scourged you with whips, but I will rule you with scorpions. And the saying pleased Roboam, and he answered the people as the young men, they that were brought up with him, counselled him: and all the people spoke as one man, every one to his neighbor, and they cried out all together, saying, We have no part in David, nor inheritance in the son of Jessae: to they tents, O Israel, every one; for this man is not for a prince or a ruler over us. And all the people was dispersed from Sikima, and they departed every one to his tent: and Roboam strengthened him self and departed, and mounted his chariot, and entered into Jerusalem: and there follow him the whole tribe of Juda, and the whole tribe of Benjamin. And it came to pass at the beginning of the year, that Roboam gathered all the men of Juda and Benjamin, and went up to fight with Jeroboam at Sikima. And the word of the Lord came to Sameas the man of God, saying, Speak to Roboam king of Juda, and to all the house of Juda and Benjamin, and to the remnant of the people, saying, Thus saith the Lord, Ye shall not go up, neither shall ye fight with your brethren the sons of Israel: return every man to his house, for this thing is from me. And they hearkened to the word of the Lord, and forbore to go up, according to the word of the Lord.
011	1KI	012	025	And Jeroboam built Sikima in mount Ephraim and dwelt in it, and went forth thence and built Phanuel.
011	1KI	012	026	And Jeroboam said in his heart, Behold, now the kingdom will return to the house of David.
011	1KI	012	027	If this people shall go up to offer sacrifice in the house of the Lord at Jerusalem, then the heart of the people will return to the Lord, and to their master, to Roboam king of Juda, and they will slay me.
011	1KI	012	028	And the king took counsel, and went, and made two golden heifers, and said to the people, Let it suffice you to have gone [hitherto] to Jerusalem: behold thy gods, O Israel, who brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.
011	1KI	012	029	And he put one in Bethel, and he put the other in Dan.
011	1KI	012	030	And this thing became a sin; and the people went before one as far as Dan, and left the house of the Lord.
011	1KI	012	031	And he made houses on the high places, and made priests of any part of the people, who were not of the sons of Levi.
011	1KI	012	032	And Jeroboam appointed a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, according to the feast in the land of Juda;
011	1KI	012	033	and went up to the altar which he made in Baethel to sacrifice to the heifers which he made, and he placed in Baethel the priests of the high places which he had made. And he went up to the altar which he had made, on the fifteenth day in the eighth month, at the feast which he devised out of his own heart; and he made a feast to the children of Israel, and went up to the altar to sacrifice.
011	1KI	013	001	And behold, there came a man of God out of Juda by the word of the Lord to Baethel, and Jeroboam stood at the altar to sacrifice.
011	1KI	013	002	And he cried against the altar by the word of the Lord, and said, O altar, altar, thus saith the Lord, Behold, a son is [to be] born to the house of David, Josias by name; and he shall offer upon thee the priests of the high places, [even] of them that sacrifice upon thee, and [he] shall burn men's bones upon thee.
011	1KI	013	003	And in that day one shall give a sign, saying, This [is] the word which the Lord has spoken, saying, Behold, the altar is rent, and the fatness upon it shall be poured out.
011	1KI	013	004	And it came to pass when king Jeroboam heard the words of the man of God who called on the altar that was in Baethel, that the king stretched forth his hand from the altar, saying, Take hold of him. And, behold, his hand, which he stretched forth against him, withered, and he could not draw it back to himself.
011	1KI	013	005	And the altar was rent, and the fatness was poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God gave by the word of the Lord.
011	1KI	013	006	And king Jeroboam said to the man of God, Intreat the Lord thy God, and let my hand be restored to me. And the man of God intreated the Lord, and he restored the king's hand to him, and it became as before.
011	1KI	013	007	And the king said to the man of God, Enter with me into the house, and dine, and I will give thee a gift.
011	1KI	013	008	And the man of God said to the king, If thou shouldest give me the half of thine house, I would not go in with thee, neither will I eat bread, neither will I drink water in this place; for thus the Lord charged me by [his] word, saying,
011	1KI	013	009	Eat no bread, and drink no water, and return not by the way by which thou camest.
011	1KI	013	010	So he departed by another way, and returned not by the way by which he came to Baethel.
011	1KI	013	011	And there dwelt an old prophet in Baethel; and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God did on that day in Baethel, and the words which he spoke to the king: and they turned the face of their father.
011	1KI	013	012	And their father spoke to them, saying, Which way went he? and his sons shew him the way by which the man of God who came out of Juda went up.
011	1KI	013	013	And he said to his sons, Saddle me the ass: and they saddled him the ass, and he mounted it,
011	1KI	013	014	and went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak: and he said to him, Art thou the man of God that came out of Juda? And he said to him, I [am].
011	1KI	013	015	And he said to him, Come with me, and eat bread.
011	1KI	013	016	And he said, I shall not by any means be able to return with thee, neither will I eat bread, neither will I drink water in this place.
011	1KI	013	017	For thus the Lord commanded me by word, saying, Eat not bread there, and drink not water, and return not thither by the way by which thou camest.
011	1KI	013	018	And he said to him, I also am a prophet as thou [art]; and an angel spoke to me by the word of the Lord, saying, Bring him back to thee into thy house, and let him eat bread and drink water: but he lied to him.
011	1KI	013	019	And he brought him back, and he ate bread and drank water in his house.
011	1KI	013	020	And it came to pass while they were sitting at the table, that the word of the Lord came to the prophet that brought him back;
011	1KI	013	021	and he spoke to the man of God that came out of Juda, saying, Thus saith the Lord, Because thou hast resisted the word of the Lord, and hast not kept the commandment which the Lord thy God commanded thee,
011	1KI	013	022	but hast returned, and eaten bread and drunk water in the place of which he spoke to thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat bread, and shalt not drink water; [therefore] thy body shall in nowise enter into the sepulchre of thy fathers.
011	1KI	013	023	And it came to pass after he had eaten bread and drunk water, that he saddled the ass for him, and he turned and departed.
011	1KI	013	024	And a lion found him in the way, and slew him; and his body was cast out in the way, and the ass was standing by it, and the lion [also] was standing by the body.
011	1KI	013	025	And, behold, men [were] passing by, and saw the carcase cast in the way, and the lion was standing near the carcase: and they went in and spoke [of it] in the city where the old prophet dwelt.
011	1KI	013	026	And [the prophet] that turned him back out of the way heard, and said, This is the man of God who rebelled against the word of the Lord.
011	1KI	013	027	[And he spoke to his sons, saying, Saddle me the ass, and they saddled it.]
011	1KI	013	028	And he went and found the body cast in the way, and the ass and the lion were standing by the body: and the lion had not devoured the body of the man of God, and had not torn the ass.
011	1KI	013	029	And the prophet took up the body of the man of God, and laid it on his ass; and the prophet brought him back to his city, to bury him in his own tomb,
011	1KI	013	030	and they bewailed him, [saying], Alas, brother.
011	1KI	013	031	And it came to pass after he had lamented him, that he spoke to his sons, saying, Whenever I die, bury me in this tomb wherein the man of God is buried; lay me by his bones, that my bones may be preserved with his bones.
011	1KI	013	032	For the word will surely come to pass which he spoke by the word of the Lord against the altar in Baethel, and against the high houses in Samaria.
011	1KI	013	033	And after this Jeroboam turned not from his sin, but he turned and made of part of the people priests of the [high places]: whoever would, he consecrated him, and he became a priest for the high places.
011	1KI	013	034	And this thing became sin to the house of Jeroboam, even to its destruction and its removal from the face of the earth.
011	1KI	014	021	And Roboam son of Solomon ruled over Juda. Roboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in the city Jerusalem, which the Lord chose to put his name there out of all the tribes of Israel: and his mother's name [was] Naama the Ammonitess.
011	1KI	014	022	And Roboam did evil in the sight of the Lord; and he provoked him in all the things which their fathers did in their sins which they sinned.
011	1KI	014	023	And they built for themselves high places, and pillars, and [planted] groves on every high hill, and under every shady tree.
011	1KI	014	024	And there was a conspiracy in the land, and they did according to all the abominations of the nations which the Lord removed from before the children of Israel.
011	1KI	014	025	And it came to pass in the fifth year of the reign of Roboam, Susakim king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem;
011	1KI	014	026	and took all the treasures of the house of the Lord, and the treasures of the king's house, and the golden spears which David took out of the hand of the sons of Adrazaar king of Suba, and brought them into Jerusalem, even all that he took, [and] the golden shields which Solomon had made, [and carried them away into Egypt.]
011	1KI	014	027	And king Roboam made brazen shields instead of them; and the chiefs of the golden shields which Solomon had made, and the chiefs of the body guard, who kept the gate of the house of the king, were placed in charge over them.
011	1KI	014	028	And it came to pass when the king went into the house of the Lord, that the body guard took them up, and fixed them in the chamber of the body guard.
011	1KI	014	029	And the rest of the history of Roboam, and all that he did, behold, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Juda?
011	1KI	014	030	And there was war between Roboam and Jeroboam continually.
011	1KI	014	031	And Roboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Abiu his son reigned in his stead.
011	1KI	015	001	And in the eighteenth year of the reign of Jeroboam son of Nabat, Abiu son of Roboam reigns over Juda.
011	1KI	015	002	And he reigned three years over Jerusalem: and his mother's name [was] Maacha, daughter of Abessalom.
011	1KI	015	003	And he walked in the sins of his father which he wrought in his presence, and his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God, as [was] the heart of his father [David].
011	1KI	015	004	Howbeit for David's sake the Lord gave him a remnant, that he might establish his children after him, and might establish Jerusalem.
011	1KI	015	005	Forasmuch as David did that which was right in the sight of the Lord: he turned not from any thing that he commanded him all the days of his life.
011	1KI	015	007	And the rest of the history of Abiu, and all that he did, behold, are not these written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Juda? And there was war between Abiu and Jeroboam.
011	1KI	015	008	And Abiu slept with his fathers in the twenty-fourth year of Jeroboam; and he is buried with his fathers in the city of David: And Asa his son reigns in his stead.
011	1KI	015	009	In the four and twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel, Asa begins to reign over Juda.
011	1KI	015	010	And he reigned forty-one years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name [was] Ana, daughter of Abessalom.
011	1KI	015	011	And Asa did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, as David his father.
011	1KI	015	012	And he removed the sodomites out of the land, and abolished all the practices which his fathers had kept up.
011	1KI	015	013	And he removed Ana his mother from being queen, forasmuch as she gathered a meeting in her grove: and Asa cut down her retreats, and burnt them with fire in the brook of Kedron.
011	1KI	015	014	But he removed not the high places; nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect with the Lord all his days.
011	1KI	015	015	And he brought in the pillars of his father, he even brought in his gold and silver pillars into the house of the Lord, and [his] vessels.
011	1KI	015	016	And there was war between Asa and Baasa king of Israel all their days.
011	1KI	015	017	And Baasa king of Israel went up against Juda, and built Rama, so that no one should go out or come in for Asa king of Juda.
011	1KI	015	018	And Asa took all the silver and the gold that was found in the treasures of the house of the Lord, and in the treasures of the king's house, and gave them into the hands of his servants; and king Asa sent them out to the son of Ader, the son of Taberema son of Azin king of Syria, who dwelt in Damascus, saying,
011	1KI	015	019	Make a covenant between me and thee, and between my father and thy father: lo! I have sent forth to thee gold and silver [for] gifts: come, break thy league with Baasa king of Israel, that he may go up from me.
011	1KI	015	020	And the son of Ader hearkened to king Asa, and sent the chiefs of his forces to the cities of Israel; and they smote Ain, Dan, and Abel of the house of Maacha, and all Chennereth, as far as the whole land of Nephthali.
011	1KI	015	021	And it came to pass when Baasa heard it, that he left off building Rama, and returned to Thersa.
011	1KI	015	022	And king Asa charged all Juda without exception: and they take up the stones of Rama and its timbers [with] which Baasa was building; and king Asa built with them upon the whole hill of Benjamin, and the watch-tower.
011	1KI	015	023	And the rest of the history of Asa, and all his mighty deeds which he wrought, and the cities which he built, behold, are not these written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Juda? Nevertheless in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet.
011	1KI	015	024	And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Josaphat his son reigns in his stead.
011	1KI	015	025	And Nabat son of Jeroboam reigns over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Juda, and he reigned two years in Israel.
011	1KI	015	026	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, and walked in the way of his father, and in his sins wherein he caused Israel to sin.
011	1KI	015	027	And Baasa son of Achia, [who was] over the house of Belaan son of Achia, conspired against him, and smote him in Gabathon of the Philistines; for Nabat and all Israel were besieging Gabathon.
011	1KI	015	028	And Baasa slew him in the third year of Asa son of Asa king of Juda; and reigned in his stead.
011	1KI	015	029	And it came to pass when he reigned, that he smote the whole house of Jeroboam, and left none that breathed of Jeroboam, until he has destroyed him utterly, according to the word of the Lord which he spoke by his servant Achia the Selonite,
011	1KI	015	030	for the sins of Jeroboam, who led Israel into sin, even by his provocation wherewith he provoked the Lord God of Israel.
011	1KI	015	031	And the rest of the history of Nabat, and all that he did, behold, are not these written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
011	1KI	015	032	[And there was a war between Asa and Baasa king of Israel in all their days.]
011	1KI	015	033	And in the third year of Asa king of Juda, Baasa the son of Achia begins to reign over Israel in Thersa, twenty and four years.
011	1KI	015	034	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, and walked in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, and in his sins, as he caused Israel to sin.
011	1KI	016	001	And the word of the Lord came by the hand of Ju son of Anani to Baasa, [saying],
011	1KI	016	002	Forasmuch as I lifted thee up from the earth, and made thee ruler over my people Israel; and thou hast walked in the way of Jeroboam, and hast caused my people Israel to sin, to provoke me with their vanities;
011	1KI	016	003	Behold, I raise up [enemies] after Baasa, and after his house; and I will make thy house as the house of Jeroboam son of Nabat.
011	1KI	016	004	Him that dies of Baasa in the city the dogs shall devour, and him that dies of his in the field the birds of the sky shall devour.
011	1KI	016	005	Now the rest of the history of Baasa, and all that he did, and his mighty acts, behold, are not these written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
011	1KI	016	006	And Baasa slept with his fathers, and they bury him in Thersa; and Ela his son reigns in his stead.
011	1KI	016	007	And the Lord spoke by Ju the son of Anani against Baasa, and against his house, [even] all the evil which he wrought before the Lord to provoke him to anger by the works of his hands, in being like the house of Jeroboam; and because he smote him.
011	1KI	016	008	And Ela son of Baasa reigned over Israel two years in Thersa.
011	1KI	016	009	And Zambri, captain of half his cavalry, conspired against him, while he was in Thersa, drinking himself drunk in the house of Osa the steward at Thersa.
011	1KI	016	010	And Zambri went in and smote him and slew him, and reigned in his stead.
011	1KI	016	011	And it came to pass when he reigned, when he sat upon his throne,
011	1KI	016	012	that he smote all the house of Baasa, according to the word which the Lord spoke against the house of Baasa, and to Ju the prophet,
011	1KI	016	013	for all the sins of Baasa and Ela his son, as he led Israel astray to sin, to provoke the Lord God of Israel with their vanities.
011	1KI	016	014	And the rest of the deeds of Ela which he did, behold, are not these written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
011	1KI	016	015	And Zambri reigned in Thersa seven days: and the army of Israel [was] encamped against Gabathon of the Philistines.
011	1KI	016	016	And the people heard in the army, saying, Zambri has conspired and smitten the king: and the people of Israel made Ambri the captain of the host king in that day in the camp over Israel.
011	1KI	016	017	And Ambri went up, and all Israel with him, out of Gabathon; and they besieged Thersa.
011	1KI	016	018	And it came to pass when Zambri saw that his city was taken, that he goes into the inner chamber of the house of the king, and burnt the king's house over him, and died.
011	1KI	016	019	Because of his sins which he committed, doing that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, so as to walk in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, and in his sins wherein he caused Israel to sin.
011	1KI	016	020	And the rest of the history of Zambri, and his conspiracies wherein he conspired, behold, are not these written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
011	1KI	016	021	Then the people of Israel divides; half the people goes after Thamni the son of Gonath to make him king; and half the people goes after Ambri.
011	1KI	016	022	The people that followed Ambri overpowered the people that followed Thamni son of Gonath; and Thamni died and Joram his brother at that time, and Ambri reigned after Thamni.
011	1KI	016	023	In the thirty-first year of king Asa, Ambri begins to reign over Israel twelve years: he reigns six years in Thersa.
011	1KI	016	024	And Ambri bought the mount Semeron of Semer the lord of the mountain for two talents of silver; and he built [upon] the mountain, and they called the name of the mountain [on] which he built, after the name of Semer the lord of the mount, Semeron.
011	1KI	016	025	And Ambri did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, and wrought wickedly beyond all that were before him.
011	1KI	016	026	And he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, and in his sins wherewith he caused Israel to sin, to provoke the Lord God of Israel by their vanities.
011	1KI	016	027	And the rest of the acts of Ambri, and all that he did, and all his might, behold, [are] not these things written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
011	1KI	016	028	And Ambri slept with his fathers, and is buried in Samaria; and Achaab his son reigns in his stead. And in the eleventh year of Ambri Josaphat the son of Asa reigns, [being] thirty-five years old in the beginning of his reign, and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name [was] Gazuba, daughter of Seli. And he walked in the way of Asa his father, and turned not from it, [even] from doing right in the eyes of the Lord: only they removed not [any] of the high places; they sacrificed and burnt incense on the high places. Now the engagements which Josaphat made with the king of Israel, and all his mighty deeds which he performed, and the enemies whom he fought against, behold, [are] not these written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Juda? and the remains of the prostitution which they practiced in the days of Asa his father, he removed out of the land: and there was no king in Syria, [but] a deputy. And king Josaphat made a ship at Tharsis to go to Sophir for gold: but it went not, for the ship was broken at Gasion Gaber. Then the king of Israel said to Josaphat, I will send forth thy servants and my servants in the ship: but Josaphat would not. And Josaphat slept with his fathers, and is buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Joram his son reigned in his stead.
011	1KI	016	029	In the second year of Josaphat king of Juda, Achaab son of Ambri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty-two years.
011	1KI	016	030	And Achaab did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, and did more wickedly than all that were before him.
011	1KI	016	031	And it was not enough for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, but he took to wife, Jezabel the daughter of Jethebaal king of the Sidonians; and he went and served Baal, and worshiped him.
011	1KI	016	032	And he set up an alter to Baal, in the house of his abominations, which he built in Samaria.
011	1KI	016	033	And Achaab made a grove; and Achaab did yet more abominably, to provoke the Lord God of Israel, and [to sin against] his own life so that he should be destroyed: he did evil above all the kings of Israel that were before him.
011	1KI	016	034	And in his days Achiel the Baethelite built Jericho: he laid the foundation of it in Abiron his first-born, and he set up the doors of it in Segub his younger son, according to the word of the Lord which he spoke by Joshua the son of Naue.
011	1KI	017	001	And Eliu the prophet, the Thesbite of Thesbae of Galaad, said to Achaab, As the Lord God of hosts, the God of Israel, lives, before whom I stand, there shall not be these years dew nor rain, except by the word of my mouth.
011	1KI	017	002	And the word of the Lord came to Eliu, [saying],
011	1KI	017	003	Depart hence eastward, and hide thee by the brook of Chorrath, that is before Jordan.
011	1KI	017	004	And it shall be [that] thou shalt drink water of the brook, and I will charge the ravens to feed thee there.
011	1KI	017	005	And Eliu did according to the word of the Lord, and he sat by the brook of Chorrath before Jordan.
011	1KI	017	006	And the ravens brought him loaves in the morning, and flesh in the evening and he drank water of the brook.
011	1KI	017	007	And it came to pass after some time, that the brook was dried up, because there had been no rain upon the earth.
011	1KI	017	008	And the word of the Lord came to Eliu, [saying],
011	1KI	017	009	Arise, and go to Sarepta of the Sidonian [land]: behold, I have there commanded a widow-woman to maintain thee.
011	1KI	017	010	And he arose and went to Sarepta, and came to the gate of the city: and, behold, a widow-woman was there gathering sticks; and Eliu cried after her, and said to her, Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.
011	1KI	017	011	And she went to fetch it; and Eliu cried after her, and said, Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of the bread that is in thy hand.
011	1KI	017	012	And the woman said, [As] the Lord thy God lives, I have not a cake, but only a handful of meal in the pitcher, and a little oil in a cruse, and, behold, I am going to gather two sticks, and I shall go in and dress it for myself and my children, and we shall eat it and die.
011	1KI	017	013	And Eliu said to her, Be of good courage, go in and do according to thy word: but make me thereof a little cake, and thou shalt bring [it] out to me first, and thou shalt make [some] for thyself and thy children last.
011	1KI	017	014	For thus saith the Lord, The pitcher of meal shall not fail, and the cruse of oil shall not diminish, until the day that the Lord gives rain upon the earth.
011	1KI	017	015	And the woman went and did [so], and did eat, she, and he, and her children.
011	1KI	017	016	And the pitcher of meal failed not, and the cruse of oil was not diminished, according to the word of the Lord which he spoke by the hand of Eliu.
011	1KI	017	017	And it came to pass afterward, that the son of the woman the mistress of the house was sick; and his sickness was very severe, until there was no breath left in him.
011	1KI	017	018	And she said to Eliu, What have I to do with thee, O man of God? hast thou come in to me to bring my sins to remembrance, and to slay my son?
011	1KI	017	019	And Eliu said to the woman, Give me thy son. And he took him out of her bosom, and took him up to the chamber in which he himself lodged, and laid him on the bed.
011	1KI	017	020	And Eliu cried aloud, and said, Alas, O Lord, the witness of the widow with whom I sojourn, thou hast wrought evil [for her] in slaying her son.
011	1KI	017	021	And he breathed on the child thrice, and called on the Lord, and said, O Lord my God, let, I pray thee, the soul of this child return to him.
011	1KI	017	022	And it was so, and the child cried out,
011	1KI	017	023	and he brought him down from the upper chamber into the house, and gave him to his mother; and Eliu said, See, thy son lives.
011	1KI	017	024	And the woman said to Eliu, Behold, I know that thou [art] a man of God, and the word of the Lord in thy mouth [is] true.
011	1KI	018	001	And it came to pass after many days, that the word of the Lord came to Eliu in the third year, saying, Go, and appear before Achaab, and I will bring rain upon the face of the earth.
011	1KI	018	002	And Eliu went to appear before Achaab: and the famine [was] severe in Samaria.
011	1KI	018	003	And Achaab called Abdiu the steward. Now Abdiu feared the Lord greatly.
011	1KI	018	004	And it came to pass when Jezabel smote the prophets of the Lord, that Abdiu took a hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.
011	1KI	018	005	And Achaab said to Abdiu, Come, and let us go through the land, and to the fountains of water, and to the brooks, if by any means we may find grass, and may save the horses and mules, and so they will not perish from the tents.
011	1KI	018	006	And they made a division of the way between them to pass through it: Achaab went one way, and Abdiu went by another way alone.
011	1KI	018	007	And Abdiu was alone in the way; and Eliu came alone to meet him: and Abdiu hasted, and fell upon his face, and said, My lord Eliu, art thou [indeed] he?
011	1KI	018	008	And Eliu said to him, I [am]: go say to thy master, Behold, Eliu [is here].
011	1KI	018	009	And Abdiu said, What sin have I committed, that thou givest thy servant into the hand of Achaab to slay me?
011	1KI	018	010	[As] the Lord thy God lives, there is not a nation or kingdom, whither my lord has not sent to seek thee; and if they said, He is not [here], then has he set fire to the kingdom and its territories, because he has not found thee.
011	1KI	018	011	And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Eliu [is here].
011	1KI	018	012	And it shall come to pass when I shall have departed from thee, that the Spirit of the Lord shall carry thee to a land which I know not, and I shall go in to tell the matter to Achaab, and he will not find thee and will slay me: yet thy servant fears the Lord from his youth.
011	1KI	018	013	Has it not been told to thee my lord, what I did when Jezabel slew the prophets of the Lord, that I hid a hundred men of the prophets of the Lord, by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?
011	1KI	018	014	And now thou sayest to me, Go, say to thy master, Behold, Eliu [is here]: and he shall slay me.
011	1KI	018	015	And Eliu said, [As] the Lord of Hosts before whom I stand lives, to-day I will appear before him.
011	1KI	018	016	And Abdiu went to meet Achaab, and told him: and Achaab hasted forth, and went to meet Eliu.
011	1KI	018	017	And it came to pass when Achaab saw Eliu, that Achaab said to Eliu, Art thou he that perverts Israel?
011	1KI	018	018	And Eliu said, I do not pervert Israel; but it is thou and thy father's house, in that ye forsake the Lord your God, and thou hast gone after Baalim.
011	1KI	018	019	And now send, gather to me all Israel to mount Carmel, and the prophets of shame four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves four hundred, that eat [at] Jezabel's table.
011	1KI	018	020	And Achaab sent to all Israel, and gathered all the prophets to mount Carmel.
011	1KI	018	021	And Eliu drew near to them all: and Eliu said to them, How long wilt ye halt on both feet? if the Lord be God, follow him; but if Baal, follow him. And the people answered not a word.
011	1KI	018	022	And Eliu said to the people, I am left, the only one prophet of the Lord; and the prophets of Baal [are] four hundred and fifty men, and the prophets of the groves four hundred.
011	1KI	018	023	Let them give us two oxen, and let them choose one for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on the wood, and put no fire [on] the wood: and I will dress the other bullock, and put on no fire.
011	1KI	018	024	And do ye call loudly on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the Lord my God, and it shall come to pass that the God who shall answer by fire, he [is] God. And all the people answered and said, The word which thou hast spoken [is] good.
011	1KI	018	025	And Eliu said to the prophets of shame, Choose to yourselves one calf, and dress it first, for ye [are] many; and call ye on the name of your god; but apply no fire.
011	1KI	018	026	And they took the calf and drest it, and called on the name of Baal from morning till noon, and said, hear us, O Baal, hear us. And there was no voice, neither was there hearing, and they ran up and down on the alter which they [had] made.
011	1KI	018	027	And it was noon, and Eliu the Thesbite mocked them, and said, Call with a loud voice, for he is a god; for he is meditating, or else perhaps he is engaged in business, or perhaps he is asleep, and is to be awaked.
011	1KI	018	028	And they cried with a loud voice, and cut themselves according to their custom with knives and lancets until the blood gushed out upon them.
011	1KI	018	029	And they prophesied until the evening came; and it came to pass as it was the time of the offering of the sacrifice, that Eliu the Thesbite spoke to the prophets of the abominations, saying, Stand by for the present, and I will offer my sacrifice. And they stood aside and departed.
011	1KI	018	030	And Eliu said to the people, Come near to me. And all the people came near to him.
011	1KI	018	031	And Eliu took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of Israel, as the Lord spoke to him, saying, Israel shall be thy name.
011	1KI	018	032	And he built up the stones in the name of the Lord, and repaired the altar that had been broken down; and he made a trench that would hold two measures of seed round about the altar.
011	1KI	018	033	And he piled the cleft wood on the altar which he [had] made, and divided the whole-burnt-offering, and laid [it] on the wood, and laid [it] in order on the altar, and said, Fetch me four pitchers of water, and pour [it] on the whole-burnt-offering, and on the wood. And they did so.
011	1KI	018	034	And he said, Do it the second time. And they did it the second time. And he said, Do it the third time. And they did it the third time.
011	1KI	018	035	And the water ran round about the altar, and they filled the trench with water.
011	1KI	018	036	And Eliu cried aloud to the heaven, and said, Lord God of Abraam, and Isaac, and Israel, answer me, O Lord, answer me this day by fire, and let all this people know that thou art the Lord, the God of Israel, and I [am] thy servant, and for thy sake I have wrought these works.
011	1KI	018	037	Hear me, O Lord, hear me, and let this people know that thou art the Lord God, and thou hast turned back the heart of this people.
011	1KI	018	038	Then fire fell from the Lord out of heaven, and devoured the whole-burnt-offerings, and the wood and the water that was in the trench, and the fire licked up the stones and the earth.
011	1KI	018	039	And all the people fell upon their faces, and said, Truly the Lord [is] God; he [is] God.
011	1KI	018	040	And Eliu said to the people, Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape. And they took them; and Eliu brings them down to the brook Kisson, and he slew them there.
011	1KI	018	041	And Eliu said to Achaab, Go up, and eat and drink, for [there is] a sound of the coming of rain.
011	1KI	018	042	And Achaab went up to eat and to drink; and Eliu went up to Carmel, and stooped to the ground, and put his face between his knees,
011	1KI	018	043	and said to his servant, Go up, and look toward the sea. And the servant looked, and said, There is nothing: and Eliu said, Do thou then go again seven times.
011	1KI	018	044	And the servant went again seven times: and it came to pass at the seventh time, that, behold, a little cloud like the sole of a man's foot brought water; and he said, Go up, and say to Achaab, make ready thy chariot, and go down, lest the rain overtake thee.
011	1KI	018	045	And it came to pass in the meanwhile, that the heaven grew black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Achaab wept, and went to Jezrael.
011	1KI	018	046	And the hand of the Lord [was] upon Eliu, and he girt up his loins, and ran before Achaab to Jezrael.
011	1KI	019	001	And Achaab told Jezabel his wife all that Eliu [had] done, and how he [had] slain the prophets with the sword.
011	1KI	019	002	And Jezabel sent to Eliu, and said, If thou art Eliu and I am Jezabel, God do so to me, and more also, if I do not make thy life by this time to-morrow as the life of one of them.
011	1KI	019	003	And Eliu feared, and rose, and departed for his life: and he comes to Bersabee [to] the land of Juda, and he left his servant there.
011	1KI	019	004	And he himself went a day's journey in the wilderness, and came and sat under a juniper tree; and asked concerning his life that he might die, and said, Let it be enough now, O Lord, take, I pray thee, my life from me; for I am no better than my fathers.
011	1KI	019	005	And he lay down and slept there under a tree; and behold, some one touched him, and said to him, Arise and eat.
011	1KI	019	006	And Eliu looked, and, behold, at his head there was a cake of meal and a cruse of water; and he arose, and ate and drank, and returned and lay down.
011	1KI	019	007	And the angel of the Lord returned again, and touched him, and said to him, Arise, and eat, for the journey [is] far from thee.
011	1KI	019	008	And he arose, and ate and drank, and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights to mount Choreb.
011	1KI	019	009	And he entered there into a cave, and rested there; and, behold, the word of the Lord [came] to him, and he said, What [doest] thou here, Eliu?
011	1KI	019	010	And Eliu said, I have been very jealous for the Lord Almighty, because the children of Israel have forsaken thee: they have digged down thine altars, and have slain thy prophets with the sword; and I only am left alone, and they seek my life to take it.
011	1KI	019	011	And he said, Thou shalt go forth to-morrow, and shalt stand before the Lord in the mount; behold, the Lord will pass by. And, behold, a great [and] strong wind rending the mountains, and crushing the rocks before the Lord; [but] the Lord [was] not in the wind; and after the wind an earthquake; [but] the Lord [was] not in the earthquake:
011	1KI	019	012	and after the earthquake a fire; [but] the Lord [was] not in the fire: and after the fire the voice of a gentle breeze.
011	1KI	019	013	And it came to pass when Eliu heard, that he wrapt his face in his mantle, and went forth and stood in the cave: and, behold, a voice [came] to him and said, What [doest] thou here, Eliu?
011	1KI	019	014	And Eliu said, I have been very jealous for the Lord Almighty; for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, and they have overthrown thine altars, and have slain thy prophets with the sword! and I am left entirely alone, and they seek my life to take it.
011	1KI	019	015	And the Lord said to him, Go, return, and thou shalt come into the way of the wilderness of Damascus: and thou shalt go and anoint Azael to be king over Syria.
011	1KI	019	016	And Ju the son of Namessi shalt thou anoint to be king over Israel; and Elisaie the son of Saphat shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy room.
011	1KI	019	017	And it shall come to pass, that him that escapes from the sword of Azael, Ju shall slay; and him that escapes from the sword of Ju, Elisaie shall slay.
011	1KI	019	018	And thou shalt leave in Israel seven thousand men, all the knees which had not bowed themselves to Baal, and every mouth which had not worshipped him.
011	1KI	019	019	And he departed thence, and finds Elisaie the son of Saphat, and he was ploughing with oxen; [there were] twelve yoke before him, and he with the twelve, and he passed by to him, and cast his mantle upon him.
011	1KI	019	020	And Elisaie left the cattle, and ran after Eliu and said, I will kiss my father, and follow after thee. And Eliu said, Return, for I have done [a work] for thee.
011	1KI	019	021	And he returned from following him, and took a yoke of oxen, and slew them, and boiled them with the instruments of the oxen, and gave to the people, and they ate: and he arose, and went after Eliu, and ministered to him.
011	1KI	020	001	And Nabuthai the Jezraelite had a vineyard, near the threshingfloor of Achaab king of Samaria.
011	1KI	020	002	And Achaab spoke to Nabuthai, saying, Give me thy vineyard, and I will have it for a garden of herbs, for it [is] near my house: and I will give thee another vineyard better than it; or if it please thee, I will give thee money, the price of this thy vineyard, and I will have it for a garden of herbs.
011	1KI	020	003	And Nabuthai said to Achaab, My God forbid me that I should give thee the inheritance of my fathers.
011	1KI	020	004	And the spirit of Achaab was troubled, and he lay down upon his bed, and covered his face, and ate no bread.
011	1KI	020	005	And Jezabel his wife went in to him, and spoke to him, [saying], Why [is] thy spirit troubled, and [why] dost thou eat no bread?
011	1KI	020	006	And he said to her, Because I spoke to Nabuthai the Jezraelite, saying, Give me thy vineyard for money; or if thou wilt, I will give thee another vineyard for it: and he said, I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers.
011	1KI	020	007	And Jezabel his wife said to him, Dost thou now thus act the king over Israel? arise, and eat bread, and be thine own [master], and I will give thee the vineyard of Nabuthai the Jezraelite.
011	1KI	020	008	And she wrote a letter in the name of Achaab, and sealed it with his seal, and sent the letter to the elders, and to the freemen who dwelt with Nabuthai.
011	1KI	020	009	And it was written in the letters, saying, Keep a fast, and set Naboth in a chief place among the people.
011	1KI	020	010	And set two men, sons of transgressors, before him, and let them testify against him, saying, He blessed God and the king: and let them lead him forth, and stone him, and let them die.
011	1KI	020	011	And the men of his city, the elders, and the nobles who dwelt in his city, did as Jezabel sent to them, and as it had been written in the letters which she sent to them.
011	1KI	020	012	And they proclaimed a fast, and set Nebuthai in a chief place among the people.
011	1KI	020	013	And two men, sons of transgressors, came in, and sat opposite him, and bore witness against him, saying, Thou hast blessed God and the king. And they led him forth out of the city, and stoned him with stones, and he died.
011	1KI	020	014	And they sent to Jezabel, saying, Nabuthai is stoned, and is dead.
011	1KI	020	015	And it came to pass, when Jezabel heard [it], that she said to Achaab, Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Nabuthai the Jezraelite, who would not sell it to thee: for Nebuthai is not alive, for he is dead.
011	1KI	020	016	And it came to pass, when Achaab heard that Nabuthai the Jezraelite was dead, that he rent his garments, and put on sackcloth. And it came to pass afterward, that Achaab arose and went down to the vineyard of Nabuthai the Jezraelite, to take possession of it.
011	1KI	020	017	And the Lord spoke to Eliu the Thesbite, saying,
011	1KI	020	018	Arise, and go down to meet Achaab king of Israel, who is in Samaria, for he [is] in the vineyard of Nabuthai, for he has gone down thither to take possession of it.
011	1KI	020	019	And thou shalt speak to him, saying, Thus saith the Lord, Forasmuch as thou hast slain and taken possession, therefore thus saith the Lord, In every place where the swine and the dogs have licked the blood of Nabuthai, there shall the dogs lick thy blood; and the harlots shall wash themselves in thy blood.
011	1KI	020	020	And Achaab said to Eliu, Hast thou found me, mine enemy? and he said, I have found [thee]: because thou hast wickedly sold thyself to work evil in the sight of the Lord, to provoke him to anger;
011	1KI	020	021	behold, I bring evil upon thee: and I will kindle a fire after thee, and I will utterly destroy every male of Achaab, and him that is shut up and him that is left in Israel.
011	1KI	020	022	And I will make thy house as the house of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, and as the house of Baasa son of Achia, because of the provocations wherewith thou hast provoked [me], and caused Israel to sin.
011	1KI	020	023	And the Lord spoke of Jezabel, saying, The dogs shall devour her within the fortification of Jezrael.
011	1KI	020	024	Him that is dead of Achaab in the city shall the dogs eat, and him that is dead of him in the field shall the birds of the sky eat.
011	1KI	020	025	But Achaab [did] wickedly, in that he sold himself to do that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, as his wife Jezabel led him astray.
011	1KI	020	026	And he did very abominably in following after the abominations, according to all that the Amorite did, whom the Lord utterly destroyed from before the children of Israel.
011	1KI	020	027	And because of the word, Achaab was pierced with sorrow before the Lord, and he both went weeping, and rent his garment, and girt sackcloth upon his body, and fasted; he put on sackcloth also in the day that he smote Nabuthai the Jezraelite, and went his way.
011	1KI	020	028	And the word of the Lord came by the hand of his servant Eliu concerning Achaab, and the Lord said,
011	1KI	020	029	Hast thou seen how Achaab has been pricked [to the heart] before me? I will not bring on the evil in his days, but in his son's days will I bring on the evil.
011	1KI	020	030	And the son of Ader gathered all his forces, and went up and besieged Samaria, [he] and thirty-two kings with him, and all [his] horse and chariots: and they went up and besieged Samaria, and fought against it.
011	1KI	020	031	And he sent into the city to Achaab king of Israel, and said to him, Thus says the son of Ader,
011	1KI	020	032	Thy silver and thy gold are mine, and thy wives and thy children are mine.
011	1KI	020	033	And the king of Israel answered and said, As thou hast said, my lord, O king, I am thine, and all mine [also].
011	1KI	020	034	And the messengers came again, and said, Thus says the son of Ader, I sent to thee, saying, Thou shalt give me thy silver and thy gold, and thy wives and thy children.
011	1KI	020	035	For at this time to-morrow I will send my servants to thee, and they shall search thy house, and the houses of thy servants, and it shall be that all the desirable objects of their eyes on which they shall lay their hands, they shall even take [them].
011	1KI	020	036	And the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said, Take notice now and consider, that this man seeks mischief: for he has sent to me concerning my wives, and concerning my sons, an concerning my daughters: I have not kept back from him my silver and my gold.
011	1KI	020	037	And the elders and all the people said to him, Hearken not, and consent not.
011	1KI	020	038	And he said to the messengers of the son of Ader, Say to your master, All things that thou hast sent to thy servant about at first I will do; but this thing I shall not be able to do. And the men departed, and carried back the answer to him.
011	1KI	020	039	And the son of Ader sent to him, saying, So do God to me, and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for foxes to all the people, even my infantry.
011	1KI	020	040	And the king of Israel answered and said, Let it be sufficient; let not the humpbacked boast as he that is upright.
011	1KI	020	041	And it came to pass when he returned him this answer, he and all the kings with him were drinking in tents: and he said to his servants, Form a trench. And they made a trench against the city.
011	1KI	020	042	And, behold, a prophet came to Achaab king of Israel, and said, Thus saith the Lord, Hast thou seen this great multitude? behold, I give it this day into thine hands; and thou shalt know that I [am] the Lord.
011	1KI	020	043	And Achaab said, Whereby? And he said, Thus saith the Lord, by the young men of the heads of the districts. And Achaab said, Who shall begin the battle? and he said, Thou.
011	1KI	021	001	And Achaab numbered the young men the heads of the districts, and they were two hundred and thirty: and afterwards he numbered the people, [even] every man fit for war, seven thousand.
011	1KI	021	002	And he went forth at noon, an the son of Ader was drinking [and] getting drunk in Socchoth, he and the kings, [even] thirty and two kings, his allies.
011	1KI	021	003	And the young men the heads of the districts went forth first; and they send and report to the king of Syria, saying, There are men come forth out of Samaria.
011	1KI	021	004	And he said to them, If they come forth peaceably, take them alive; and if they come forth to war, take them alive:
011	1KI	021	005	and let not the young men the heads of the districts go forth of the city. And the force that was behind them
011	1KI	021	006	smote each one the man next to him; and each one a second time smote the man next to him: and Syria fled, and Israel pursued them; and the son of Ader, [even] the king of Syria, escapes on the horse of a horseman.
011	1KI	021	007	And the king of Israel went forth, and took all the horses and the chariots, and smote [the enemy] with a great slaughter in Syria.
011	1KI	021	008	And the prophet came to the king of Israel, and said, Strengthen thyself, and observe, and see what thou shalt do; for at the return of the year the son of Ader king of Syria comes up against thee.
011	1KI	021	009	And the servants of the king of Syria, even they said, The God of Israel [is] a God of mountains, and not a God of valleys; therefore has he prevailed against us: but if we should fight against them in the plain, verily we shall prevail against them.
011	1KI	021	010	And do thou this thing: Send away the kings, each one to his place, and set princes in their stead.
011	1KI	021	011	And we will give thee [another] army according to the army that was destroyed, and cavalry according to the cavalry, and chariots according to the chariots, and we will fight against them in the plain, and we shall prevail against them. And he hearkened to their voice, and did so.
011	1KI	021	012	And it came to pass at the return of the year, that the son of Ader reviewed Syria, and went up to Apheca to war against Israel.
011	1KI	021	013	And the children of Israel were numbered, and came to meet them: and Israel encamped before them as two little flocks of goats, but Syria filled the land.
011	1KI	021	014	And there came the man of God, and said to the king of Israel, Thus saith the Lord, Because Syria has said, The Lord God of Israel [is] a God of the hills, and he [is] not a God of the valleys, therefore will I give this great army into thy hand, and thou shalt know that I [am] the Lord.
011	1KI	021	015	And they encamp one over against the other before them seven days. And it came to pass on the seventh day that the battle drew on, and Israel smote Syria, [even] a hundred thousand footmen in one day.
011	1KI	021	016	And the rest fled to Apheca, into the city; and the wall fell upon twenty-seven thousand men that were left: and the son of Ader fled, and entered into an inner chamber, into a closet.
011	1KI	021	017	And he said to his servants, I know that the kings of Israel are merciful kings: let us now put sackcloth upon our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and let us go forth to the king of Israel, if by any means he will save our souls alive.
011	1KI	021	018	So they girt sackcloth upon their loins, and put ropes upon their heads, and said to the king of Israel, Thy servant the son of Ader says, Let our souls live, I pray thee. And he said, Does he yet live? He is my brother.
011	1KI	021	019	And the men divined, and offered drink-offerings; and they caught the word out of his mouth, and said, Thy brother the son of Ader. And he said, Go ye in and fetch him. And the son of Ader went out to him, and they cause him to go up to him into the chariot.
011	1KI	021	020	And he said to him, The cities which my father took from thy father I will restore to thee; and thou shalt make streets for thyself in Damascus, as my father made streets in Samaria; and I will let thee go with a covenant. And he made a covenant with him, and let him go.
011	1KI	021	021	And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said to his neighbour by the word of the Lord, Smite me, I pray, And the man would not smite him.
011	1KI	021	022	And he said to him, Because thou hast not hearkened to the voice of the Lord, therefore, behold, as thou departest from me, a lion shall smite thee: and he departed from him, and a lion found him, and smote him.
011	1KI	021	023	And he finds another man, and says, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man smote him, and in smiting wounded [him].
011	1KI	021	024	And the prophet went and stood before the king of Israel by the way, and bound his eyes with a bandage.
011	1KI	021	025	And it came to pass as the king passed by, that he cried aloud to the king, and said, Thy servant went out to war, and, behold, a man brought [another] man to me, and said to me, Keep his man; and if he should by any means escape, then thy life shall go for his life, or thou shalt pay a talent of silver.
011	1KI	021	026	And it came to pass, that thy servant looked round this way and that way, and the man was gone. And the king of Israel said to him, Behold, thou hast also destroyed snares [set] for me.
011	1KI	021	027	And he hasted, and took away the bandage from his eyes; and the king of Israel recognized him, that he was one of the prophets.
011	1KI	021	028	And he said to him, Thus saith the Lord, Because thou hast suffered to escape out of thine hand a man appointed to destruction, therefore thy life shall go for his life, and thy people for his people.
011	1KI	021	029	And the king of Israel departed confounded and discouraged, and came to Samaria.
011	1KI	022	001	And he rested three years, and there was no war between Syria and Israel.
011	1KI	022	002	And it came to pass in the third year, that Josaphat king of Juda went down to the king of Israel.
011	1KI	022	003	And the king of Israel said to his servants, Know ye that Remmath Galaad [is] ours, and we are slow to take it out of the hand of the king of Syria?
011	1KI	022	004	And the king of Israel said to Josaphat, Wilt thou go up with us to Remmath Galaad to battle?
011	1KI	022	005	And Josaphat said, As I [am], so [art] thou also; as my people, [so is] thy people; as my horses, [so are] thy horses. And Josaphat king of Juda said to the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray thee, of the Lord to-day.
011	1KI	022	006	And the king of Israel gathered all the prophets together, about four hundred men; and the king said to them, Shall I go up to Remmath Galaad to battle, or shall I forbear? and they said, Go up, and the Lord will surely give [it] into the hands of the king.
011	1KI	022	007	And Josaphat said to the king of Israel, Is there not here a prophet of the Lord, that we may enquire of the Lord by him?
011	1KI	022	008	And the king of Israel said to Josaphat, There is one man here [for us] to enquire of the Lord by; but I hate him, for he does not speak good of me, but only evil; Michaias son of Jemblaa. And Josaphat king of Juda said, Let not the king say so.
011	1KI	022	009	And the king of Israel called a eunuch and said, [Bring hither] quickly Michaias son of Jemblaa.
011	1KI	022	010	And the king of Israel and Josaphat king of Juda sat, each on his throne, armed in the gates of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.
011	1KI	022	011	And Sedekias son of Chanaan made for himself iron horns, and said, Thus saith the Lord, With these thou shalt push Syria, until it be consumed.
011	1KI	022	012	And all the prophets prophesied in like manner, saying, Go up to Remmath Galaad, and [the thing] shall prosper, and the Lord shall deliver it and the king of Syria into thine hands.
011	1KI	022	013	And the messenger that went to call Michaias spoke to him, saying, Behold now, all the prophets speak with one mouth good concerning the king, let now thy words be like the words of one of them, and speak good things.
011	1KI	022	014	And Michaias said, [As] the Lord lives, whatsoever the Lord shall say to me, that will I speak.
011	1KI	022	015	And he came to the king: and the king said to him, Michaias, shall I go up to Remmath Galaad to battle, or shall I forbear? and he said, Go up, and the Lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king.
011	1KI	022	016	And the king said to him, How often shall I adjure thee, that thou speak to me truth in the name of the Lord?
011	1KI	022	017	And he said, Not so. I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains as a flock without a shepherd: and the Lord said, [Is] not God lord of these? let each one return to his home in peace.
011	1KI	022	018	And the king of Israel said to Josaphat king of Juda, Did I not say to thee that this man does not prophesy good to me, for [he speaks] nothing but evil?
011	1KI	022	019	And Michaias said, Not so, [it is] not I: hear the word of the Lord; [it is] not so. I saw the God of Israel sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven stood about him on his right hand and on his left.
011	1KI	022	020	And the Lord said, Who will deceive Achaab king of Israel, that he may go up and fall in Remmath Galaad? and one spoke one way, and another another way.
011	1KI	022	021	And there came forth a spirit and stood before the Lord, and said, I will deceive him.
011	1KI	022	022	And the Lord said to him, Whereby? And he said, I will go forth, and will be a false spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Thou shalt deceive him, yea, and shalt prevail: go forth, and do so.
011	1KI	022	023	And now, behold, the Lord has put a false spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets, and the Lord has spoken evil against thee.
011	1KI	022	024	And Sedekias the son of Chanaan came near and smote Michaias on the cheek, and said, What sort of a spirit of the Lord [has] spoken in thee?
011	1KI	022	025	And Michaias said, Behold, thou shalt see in that day, when thou shalt go into an innermost chamber to hide thyself there.
011	1KI	022	026	And the king of Israel said, Take Michaias, and convey him away to Semer the keeper of the city;
011	1KI	022	027	and tell Joas the king's son to put this [fellow] in prison, and to feed him with bread of affliction and water of affliction until I return in peace.
011	1KI	022	028	And Michaias said, If thou return at all in peace, the Lord has not spoken by me.
011	1KI	022	029	So the king of Israel went up, and Josaphat king of Juda with him to Remmath Galaad.
011	1KI	022	030	And the king of Israel said to Josaphat king of Juda, I will disguise myself, and enter into the battle, and do thou put on my raiment. So the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle.
011	1KI	022	031	And the king of Syria had charged the thirty-two captains of his chariots, saying, Fight not [against] small or great, but against the king of Israel only.
011	1KI	022	032	And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Josaphat king of Juda, that they said, this seems [to be] the king of Israel. And they compassed him about to fight [against] him; and Josaphat cried out.
011	1KI	022	033	And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw that this was not the king of Israel, that they returned from him.
011	1KI	022	034	And one drew a bow with a good aim, and smote the king of Israel between the lungs and the breast-plate: and he said to his charioteer, Turn thine hands, and carry me away out of the battle, for I am wounded.
011	1KI	022	035	And the war was turned in that day, and the king was standing on the chariot, against Syria from morning till evening; and he shed the blood out of his wound, into the bottom of the chariot, and died at even, and the blood ran out of the wound into the bottom of the chariot.
011	1KI	022	036	And the herald of the army stood at sunset, saying, Let every man go to his own city and his own land,
011	1KI	022	037	for the king is dead. And they came to Samaria, and buried the king in Samaria.
011	1KI	022	038	And they washed the chariot at the fountain of Samaria; and the swine and the dogs licked up the blood, and the harlots washed themselves in the blood, according to the word of the Lord which he spoke.
011	1KI	022	039	And the rest of the acts of Achaab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he built, and all the cities which he built, behold, [are] not these things written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
011	1KI	022	040	And Achaab slept with his fathers, and Ochozias his son reigned in his stead.
011	1KI	022	041	And Josaphat the son of Asa reigned over Juda: in the fourth year of Achaab king of Israel began Josaphat to reign.
011	1KI	022	042	Thirty and five years old [was he] when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name [was] Azuba daughter of Salai.
011	1KI	022	043	And he walked in all the way of Asa his father: he turned not from it, even from doing that which was right in the eyes of the Lord. Only he took not away [any] of the high places: the people still sacrificed and burnt incense on the high places.
011	1KI	022	044	And Josaphat was at peace with the king of Israel.
011	1KI	022	045	And the rest of the acts of Josaphat, and his mighty deeds, whatever he did, behold, [are] not these things written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Juda?
011	1KI	022	050	And Josaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried by his fathers in the city of David his father, and Joram his son reigned in his stead.
011	1KI	022	051	And Ochozias son of Achaab reigned over Israel in Samaria: in the seventeenth year of Josaphat king of Juda, Ochozias son of Achaab reigned over Israel in Samaria two years.
011	1KI	022	052	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, and walked in the way of Achaab his father, and in the way of Jezabel his mother, and in the sins of the house of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, who caused Israel to sin.
011	1KI	022	053	And he served Baalim, and worshipped them, and provoked the Lord God of Israel, according to all that had been done before him.

012	2KI	001	001	And Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Achaab.
012	2KI	001	002	And Ochozias fell through the lattice that was in his upper chamber in Samaria and was sick; and he sent messengers, and said to them, Go and enquire of Baal fly, the god of Accaron, whether I shall recover of this my sickness. And they went to enquire of him.
012	2KI	001	003	And an angel of the Lord called Eliu the Thesbite, saying, Arise, and go to meet the messengers of Ochozias king of Samaria, and thou shalt say to them, [Is it] because there is no God in Israel, [that] ye go to enquire of Baal fly, the God of Accaron? but [it shall] not [be] so.
012	2KI	001	004	For thus saith the Lord, The bed on which thou art gone up, thou shalt not come down from it, for thou shalt surely die. And Eliu went, and said [so] to them.
012	2KI	001	005	And the messengers returned to him, and he said to them, Why have ye returned?
012	2KI	001	006	And they said to him, A man came up to meet us, and said to us, Go, return to the king that sent you, and say to him, Thus saith the Lord, [Is it] because there is no God in Israel, [that] thou goest to enquire of Baal fly, the God of Accaron? [it shall] not [be] so: the bed on which thou art gone up, thou shalt not come down from it, for thou shalt surely die.
012	2KI	001	007	So they returned and reported to the king as Eliu said: and he said to them, What [was] the manner of the man who went up to meet you, and spoke to you these words?
012	2KI	001	008	And they said to him, [He was] a hairy man, and girt with a leathern girdle about his loins. And he said, This is Eliu the Thesbite.
012	2KI	001	009	And he sent to him a captain of fifty and his fifty; and he went up to him: and, behold, Eliu sat on the top of a mountain. And the captain of fifty spoke to him, and said, O man of God, the king has called thee, come down.
012	2KI	001	010	And Eliu answered and said to the captain of fifty, And if I [am] a man of God, fire shall come down out of heaven, and devour thee and thy fifty. And fire came down out of heaven, and devoured him and his fifty.
012	2KI	001	011	And the king sent a second time to him another captain of fifty, and his fifty. And the captain of fifty spoke to him, and said, O man of God, thus says the king, Come down quickly.
012	2KI	001	012	And Eliu answered and spoke to him, and said, If I [am] a man of God, fire shall come down out of heaven, and devour thee and thy fifty. And fire came down out of heaven, and devoured him and his fifty.
012	2KI	001	013	And the king sent yet again a captain and his fifty. And the third captain of fifty came, and knelt on his knees before Eliu, and entreated him, and spoke to him and said, O man of God, let my life, and the life of these fifty thy servants, be precious in thine eyes.
012	2KI	001	014	Behold, fire came down from heaven, and devoured the two first captains of fifty: and now, I pray, let my life be precious in thine eyes.
012	2KI	001	015	And the angel of the Lord spoke to Eliu, and said, Go down with him, be not afraid of them. And Eliu rose up, and went down with him to the king.
012	2KI	001	016	And Eliu spoke to him, and said, Thus saith the Lord, Why hast thou sent messengers to enquire of Baal fly, the god of Accaron? [it shall] not [be] so: the bed on which thou art gone up, thou shalt not come down from it, for thou shalt surely die.
012	2KI	001	017	So he died according to the word of the Lord which Eliu has spoken.
012	2KI	001	018	And the rest of the acts of Ochozias which he did, behold, [are] they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? and Joram son of Achaab reigns over Israel in Samaria twelve years [beginning] in the eighteenth year of Josaphat king of Juda: and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, only not as his brethren, nor as his mother: and he removed the pillars of Baal which his father made, and broke them in pieces: only he was joined to the sins of the house of Jeroboam, who led Israel to sin; he departed not from them. And the Lord was very angry with the house of Achaab.
012	2KI	002	001	And it came to pass, when the Lord was going to take Eliu with a whirlwind as it were into heaven, that Eliu and Elisaie went out of Galgala.
012	2KI	002	002	And Eliu said to Elisaie, Stay here, I pray thee; for God has sent me to Baethel. And Elisaie said, [As] the Lord lives and thy soul lives, I will not leave thee; so they came to Baethel.
012	2KI	002	003	And the sons of the prophets who were in Baethel came to Elisaie, and said to him, Dost thou know, that the Lord this day is going to take thy lord away from thy head? And he said, Yea, I know [it]; be silent.
012	2KI	002	004	And Eliu said to Elisaie, Stay here, I pray thee; for the Lord has sent me to Jericho. And he said, [As] the Lord lives and thy soul lives, I will not leave thee. And they came to Jericho.
012	2KI	002	005	And the sons of the prophets who were in Jericho drew near to Elisaie, and said to him, Dost thou know that the Lord is about to take away thy master to-day from thy head? And he said, Yea, I know [it]; hold your peace.
012	2KI	002	006	And Eliu said to him, Stay here, I pray thee, for the Lord has sent me to Jordan. And Elisaie said, [As] the Lord lives and thy soul lives, I will not leave thee: and they both went on.
012	2KI	002	007	And fifty men of the sons of the prophets [went also], and they stood opposite afar off: and both stood on [the bank] of Jordan.
012	2KI	002	008	And Eliu took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote the water: and the water was divided on this side and on that side, and they both went over on dry ground.
012	2KI	002	009	And it came to pass while they were crossing over, that Eliu said to Elisaie, Ask what I shall do for thee before I am taken up from thee. And Elisaie said, Let there be, I pray thee, a double [portion] of thy spirit upon me.
012	2KI	002	010	And Eliu said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: if thou shalt see me when I am taken up from thee, then shall it be so to thee; and if not, it shall not be [so].
012	2KI	002	011	And it came to pass as they were going, they went on talking; and, behold, a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and it separated between them both; and Eliu was taken up in a whirlwind as it were into heaven.
012	2KI	002	012	And Elisaie saw, and cried, Father, father, the chariot of Israel, and the horseman thereof! And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his garments, and rent them into two pieces.
012	2KI	002	013	And Elisaie took up the mantle of Eliu, which fell from off him upon Elisaie; and Elisaie returned, and stood upon the brink of Jordan;
012	2KI	002	014	and he took the mantle of Eliu, which fell from off him, and smote the water, and said, Where is the Lord God of Eliu? and he smote the waters, and they were divided hither and thither; and Elisaie went over.
012	2KI	002	015	And the sons of the prophets who were in Jericho on the opposite side saw him, and said, The spirit of Eliu has rested upon Elisaie. And they came to meet him, and did obeisance to him to the ground.
012	2KI	002	016	And they said to him, Behold now, [there are] with thy servants fifty men of strength: let them go now, and seek thy lord: peradventure the Spirit of the Lord has taken him up, and cast him into Jordan, or on one of the mountains, or on one of the hills. And Elisaie said, Ye shall not send.
012	2KI	002	017	And they pressed him until he was ashamed; and he said, Send. And they sent fifty men, and sought three days, and found him not.
012	2KI	002	018	And they returned to him, for he dwelt in Jericho: and Elisaie said, Did I not say to you, Go not?
012	2KI	002	019	And the men of the city said to Elisaie, Behold, the situation of the city [is] good, as [our] lord sees; but the waters [are] bad, and the ground barren.
012	2KI	002	020	And Elisaie said, Bring me a new pitcher, and put salt in it. And they took [one], and brought [it] to him.
012	2KI	002	021	And Elisaie went out to the spring of the waters, and cast salt therein, and says, Thus saith the Lord, I have healed these waters; there shall not be any longer death thence or barren [land].
012	2KI	002	022	And the waters were healed until this day, according to the word of Elisaie which he spoke.
012	2KI	002	023	And he went up thence to Baethel: and as he was going up by the way there came up also little children from the city, and mocked him, and said to him, Go up, bald-head, go up.
012	2KI	002	024	And he turned after them, and saw them, and cursed them in the name of the Lord. And, behold, there came out two bears out of the wood, and they tore forty and two children of them.
012	2KI	002	025	And he went thence to mount Carmel, and returned thence to Samaria.
012	2KI	003	001	And Joram the son of Achaab began to reign in Israel in the eighteenth year of Josaphat king of Juda, and he reigned twelve years.
012	2KI	003	002	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, only not as his father, nor as his mother: and he removed the pillars of Baal which his father had made.
012	2KI	003	003	Only he adhered to the sin of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, who made Israel to sin; he departed not from it.
012	2KI	003	004	And Mosa king of Moab was a sheep-master, and he rendered to the king of Israel in the beginning [of the year], a hundred thousand lambs, and a hundred thousand rams, with the wool.
012	2KI	003	005	And it came to pass, after the death of Achaab, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.
012	2KI	003	006	And king Joram went forth in that day out of Samaria, and numbered Israel.
012	2KI	003	007	And he went and sent to Josaphat king of Juda, saying, The king of Moab has rebelled against me: wilt thou go with me against Moab to war? And he said, I will go up: thou art as I, I am as thou; as my people, so [is] thy people, as my horses, so [are] thy horses.
012	2KI	003	008	And he said, What way shall I go up? and he said, The way of the wilderness of Edom.
012	2KI	003	009	And the king of Israel went, and the king of Juda, and the king of Edom: and they fetched a compass of seven days' journey; and there was no water for the army, and for the cattle that went with them.
012	2KI	003	010	And the king of Israel said, Alas! that the Lord should have called the three kings on their way, to give them into the hand of Moab.
012	2KI	003	011	And Josaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the Lord, that we may enquire of the Lord by him? And one of the servants of the king of Israel answered and said, [There is] here Elisaie son of Saphat, who poured water on the hands of Eliu.
012	2KI	003	012	And Josaphat said, He has the word of the Lord. And the king of Israel, and Josaphat king of Juda, and the king of Edom, went down to him.
012	2KI	003	013	And Elisaie said to the king of Israel, What have I to do with thee? go to the prophets of thy father, and the prophets of thy mother. And the king of Israel said to him, Has the Lord called the three kings to deliver them into the hands of Moab?
012	2KI	003	014	And Elisaie said, [As] the Lord of hosts before whom I stand lives, unless I regarded the presence of Josaphat the king of Juda, I would not have looked on thee, nor seen thee.
012	2KI	003	015	And now fetch me a harper. And it came to pass, as the harper harped, that the hand of the Lord came upon him.
012	2KI	003	016	And he said, Thus saith the Lord, Make this valley full of trenches.
012	2KI	003	017	For thus saith the Lord, Ye shall not see wind, neither shall ye see rain, yet this valley shall be filled with water, and ye, and your flocks, and your cattle shall drink.
012	2KI	003	018	And this [is] a light [thing] in the eyes of the Lord: I will also deliver Moab into your hand.
012	2KI	003	019	And ye shall smite every strong city, and ye shall cut down every good tree, and ye shall stop all wells of water, and spoil every good piece [of land] with stones.
012	2KI	003	020	And it came to pass in the morning, when the sacrifice was offered, that, behold! waters came from the way of Edom, and the land was filled with water.
012	2KI	003	021	And all Moab heard that the three kings were come up to fight against them; and they cried out on every [side, even] all that were girt with a girdle, and they said, Ho! and stood upon the border.
012	2KI	003	022	And they rose early in the morning, and the sun rose upon the waters, and Moab saw the waters on the opposite side red as blood.
012	2KI	003	023	And they said, This [is] the blood of the sword; and the kings have fought, and each man has smitten his neighbour; now then to the spoils, Moab.
012	2KI	003	024	And they entered into the camp of Israel; and Israel arose and smote Moab, and they fled from before them; and they went on and smote Moab as they went.
012	2KI	003	025	And they razed the cities, and cast every man his stone on every good piece [of land] and filled it; and they stopped every well, and cut down every good tree, until they left [only] the stones of the wall cast down; and the slingers compassed [the land], and smote it.
012	2KI	003	026	And the king of Moab saw that the battle prevailed against him; and he took with him seven hundred men that drew sword, to cut through to the king of Edom: and they could not.
012	2KI	003	027	And he took his eldest son whom he had designed to reign in his stead, and offered him up for a whole-burnt-offering on the walls. And there was a great indignation against Israel; and they departed from him, and returned to their land.
012	2KI	004	001	And one of the wives of the sons of the prophets cried to Elisaie, saying, Thy servant my husband is dead; and thou knowest that thy servant feared the Lord: and the creditor is come to take my two sons to be his servants.
012	2KI	004	002	And Elisaie said, What shall I do for thee? tell me what thou hast in the house. And she said, Thy servant has nothing in the house, except oil wherewith I anoint myself.
012	2KI	004	003	And he said to her, Go, borrow for thyself vessels without of all thy neighbours, [even] empty vessels; borrow not a few.
012	2KI	004	004	And thou shalt go in and shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons, and thou shalt pour forth into these vessels, and remove that which is filled.
012	2KI	004	005	And she departed from him, and shut the door upon herself and upon her sons: they brought the vessels near to her, and she poured in until the vessels were filled.
012	2KI	004	006	And she said to her sons, Bring me yet a vessel. And they said to her, There is not a vessel more. And the oil stayed.
012	2KI	004	007	And she came and told the man of God: and Elisaie said, Go, and sell the oil, and thou shalt pay thy debts, and thou and thy sons shall live of the remaining oil.
012	2KI	004	008	And a day came, when Elisaie passed over to Soman, and [there was] a great lady there, and she constrained him to eat bread: and it came to pass as often as he went into [the city, that] he turned aside to eat there.
012	2KI	004	009	And the woman said to her husband, See now, I know that this [is] a holy man of God who comes over continually to us.
012	2KI	004	010	Let us now make for him an upper chamber, a small place; and let us put there for him a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a candlestick: and it shall come to pass that when he comes in to us, he shall turn in thither.
012	2KI	004	011	And a day came, and he went in thither, and turned aside into the upper chamber, and lay there.
012	2KI	004	012	And he said to Giezi his servant, Call me this Somanite. and he called her, and she stood before him.
012	2KI	004	013	And he said to him, Say now to her, Behold, thou hast taken all this trouble for us; what should I do for thee? Hast thou any request [to make] to the king, or to the captain of the host? And she said, I dwell in the midst of my people.
012	2KI	004	014	And he said to Giezi, What must we do for her? and Giezi his servant said, Indeed she has no son, and her husband [is] old.
012	2KI	004	015	And he called her, and she stood by the door.
012	2KI	004	016	And Elisaie said to her, At this time [next year], as the season [is], thou [shalt be] alive, and embrace a son. And she said, Nay, my lord, do not lie to thy servant.
012	2KI	004	017	And the woman conceived, and bore a son at the very time, as the season was, being alive, as Elisaie said to her.
012	2KI	004	018	And the child grew: and it came to pass when he went out to his father to the reapers,
012	2KI	004	019	that he said to his father, My head, my head. and [his father] said to a servant, carry him to his mother.
012	2KI	004	020	And he carried him to his mother, and he lay upon her knees till noon, and died.
012	2KI	004	021	And she carried him up and laid him on the bed of the man of god; and she shut the door upon him, and went out.
012	2KI	004	022	And she called her husband, and said, Send now for me one of the young men, and one of the asses, and I will ride quickly to the man of God, and return.
012	2KI	004	023	And he said, Why art thou going to him to-day? It is neither new moon, nor the Sabbath. And she said, [It is] well.
012	2KI	004	024	And she saddled the ass, and said to her servant, Be quick, proceed: spare not on my account to ride, unless I shall tell thee. Go, and thou shalt proceed, and come to the man of God to mount Carmel.
012	2KI	004	025	And she rode and came to the man of God to the mountain: and it came to pass when Elisaie saw her coming, that he said to Giezi his servant, See now, that Somanite comes.
012	2KI	004	026	Now run to meet her, and thou shalt say, [Is it] well with thee? [is it] well with thy husband? [is it] well with the child? and she said, [It is] well.
012	2KI	004	027	And she came to Elisaie to the mountain, and laid hold of his feet; and Giezi drew near to thrust her away. And Elisaie said, Let her alone, for her soul [is] much grieved in her, and the Lord has hidden [it] from me, and has not told [it] me.
012	2KI	004	028	And she said, Did I ask a son of my lord? For did I not say, Do not deal deceitfully with me?
012	2KI	004	029	And Elisaie said to Giezi, Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in thy hand, and go: if thou meet any man, thou shalt not salute him, and if a man salute thee thou shalt not answer him: and thou shalt lay my staff on the child's face.
012	2KI	004	030	And the mother of the child said, [As] the Lord lives and [as] thy soul lives, I will not leave thee. And Elisaie arose, and went after her.
012	2KI	004	031	And Giezi went on before her, and laid his staff on the child's face: but there was neither voice nor any hearing. So he returned to meet him, and told him, saying, The child is not awaked.
012	2KI	004	032	And Elisaie went into the house, and, behold, the dead child was laid upon his bed.
012	2KI	004	033	And Elisaie went into the house, and shut the door upon themselves, the two, and prayed to the Lord.
012	2KI	004	034	And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands; and bowed himself upon him, and the flesh of the child grew warm.
012	2KI	004	035	And he returned, and walked up and down in the house: and he went up, and bowed himself on the child seven times; and the child opened his eyes.
012	2KI	004	036	And Elisaie cried out to Giezi, and said, Call this Somanite. So he called her, and she came in to him: and Elisaie said, Take thy son.
012	2KI	004	037	And the woman went in, and fell at his feet, and did obeisance [bowing] to the ground; and she took her son, and went out.
012	2KI	004	038	And Elisaie returned to Galgala: and a famine [was] in the land; and the sons of the prophets sat before him: and Elisaie said to his servant, Set on the great pot, and boil pottage for the sons of the prophets.
012	2KI	004	039	And he went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a vine in the field, and gathered of it wild gourds, his garment full; and he cast it into the caldron of pottage, for they knew [them] not.
012	2KI	004	040	And he poured it out for the men to eat: and it came to pass, when they were eating of the pottage, that lo! they cried out, and said, [There is] death in the pot, O man of God. And they could not eat.
012	2KI	004	041	And he said, Take meal, and cast it into the pot. And Elisaie said to his servant Giezi, Pour out for the people, and let them eat. And there was no longer there any hurtful thing in the pot.
012	2KI	004	042	And there came a man over from Baetharisa, and brought to the man of God twenty barley loaves and cakes of figs, of the first-fruits. And he said, Give to the people, and let them eat.
012	2KI	004	043	And his servant said, Why should I set this before a hundred men? and he said, Give to the people, and let them eat; for thus saith the Lord, They shall eat and leave.
012	2KI	004	044	And they ate and left, according to the word of the Lord.
012	2KI	005	001	Now Naiman, the captain of the host of Syria, was a great man before his master, and highly respected, because by him the Lord had given deliverance to Syria, and the man was mighty in strength, [but] a leper.
012	2KI	005	002	And the Syrians went forth in small bands, and took captive out of the land of Israel a little maid: and she waited on Naiman's wife.
012	2KI	005	003	And she said to her mistress, O that my lord were before the prophet of God in Samaria; then he would recover him from his leprosy.
012	2KI	005	004	And she went in and told her lord, and said, Thus and thus spoke the maid from the land of Israel.
012	2KI	005	005	And the king of Syria said to Naiman, Go to, go, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel. And he went, and took in his hand ten talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of raiment.
012	2KI	005	006	And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, Now then, as soon as this letter shall reach thee, behold, I have sent to thee my servant Naiman, and thou shalt recover him from his leprosy.
012	2KI	005	007	And it came to pass, when the king of Israel read the letter, [that] he rent his garments, and said, [Am] I God, to kill and to make alive, that this [man] sends to me to recover a man of his leprosy? consider, however, I pray you, and see that this [man] seeks an occasion against me.
012	2KI	005	008	And it came to pass, when Elisaie heard that the king of Israel had rent his garments, that he sent to the king of Israel, saying, Wherefore hast thou rent thy garments? Let Naiman, I pray thee, come to me, and let him know that there is a prophet in Israel.
012	2KI	005	009	So Naiman came with horse and chariot, and stood at the door of the house of Elisaie.
012	2KI	005	010	And Elisaie sent a messenger to him, saying, Go and wash seven times in Jordan, and thy flesh shall return to thee, and thou shalt be cleansed.
012	2KI	005	011	And Naiman was angry, and departed, and said, Behold, I said, He will by all means come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of his God, and lay his hand upon the place, and recover the leper.
012	2KI	005	012	[Are] not the Abana and Pharphar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not go and wash in them, and be cleansed? and he turned and went away in a rage.
012	2KI	005	013	And his servants came near and said to him, [Suppose] the prophet had spoken a great thing to thee, wouldest thou not perform it? yet he has but said to thee, Wash, and be cleansed.
012	2KI	005	014	So Naiman went down, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan, according to the word of Elisaie: and his flesh returned to him as the flesh of a little child, and he was cleansed.
012	2KI	005	015	And he and all his company returned to Elisaie, and he came and stood before him, and said, Behold, I know that there is no God in all the earth, save only in Israel: and now receive a blessing of thy servant.
012	2KI	005	016	And Elisaie said, [As] the Lord lives, before whom I stand, I will not take [one]. And he pressed him to take [one]: but he would not.
012	2KI	005	017	And Naiman said, Well then, if not, let there be given to thy servant, I pray thee, the load [of a] yoke of mules; and thou shalt give me of the red earth: for henceforth thy servant will not offer whole-burnt-offering or sacrifice to other gods, but only to the Lord by [reason of] this thing.
012	2KI	005	018	And let the Lord be propitious to thy servant when my master goes into the house of Remman to worship there, and he shall lean on my hand, and I shall bow down in the house of Remman when he bows down in the house of Remman; even let the Lord, I pray, be merciful to thy servant in this matter.
012	2KI	005	019	And Elisaie said to Naiman, Go in peace. And he departed from him a little way.
012	2KI	005	020	And Giezi the servant of Elisaie said, Behold, my Lord has spared this Syrian Naiman, so as not to take of his hand what he has brought: as the Lord lives, I will surely run after him, and take somewhat of him.
012	2KI	005	021	So Giezi followed after Naiman: and Naiman saw him running after him, and turned back from his chariot to meet him.
012	2KI	005	022	And [Giezi] said, All is well: my master has sent me, saying, Behold, now are there come to me two young men of the sons of the prophets from mount Ephraim; give them, I pray thee, a talent of silver, and two changes of raiment.
012	2KI	005	023	And [Naiman] said, Take two talents of silver. And he took two talents of silver in two bags, and two changes of raiment, and put them upon two of his servants, and they bore them before him.
012	2KI	005	024	And he came to a secret place, and took them from their hands, and laid them up in the house, and dismissed the men.
012	2KI	005	025	And he went in himself and stood before his master; and Elisaie said to him,
012	2KI	005	026	Whence [comest thou], Giezi? and Giezi said, Thy servant has not been hither or thither. And Elisaie said to him, Went not my heart with thee, when the man returned from his chariot to meet thee? and now thou hast received silver, and now thou hast received raiment, and olive yards, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and maidservants.
012	2KI	005	027	The leprosy also of Naiman shall cleave to thee, and to thy seed for ever. And he went out from his presence leprous, like snow.
012	2KI	006	001	And the sons of the prophets said to Elisaie, Behold now, the place wherein we dwell before thee is too narrow for us.
012	2KI	006	002	Let us go, we pray thee, unto Jordan, and take thence every man a beam, and make for ourselves a habitation there.
012	2KI	006	003	And he said, Go. And one of them said gently, Come with thy servants. And he said, I will go.
012	2KI	006	004	And he went with them, and they came to Jordan, and began to cut down wood.
012	2KI	006	005	And behold, one was cutting down a beam, and the axe head fell into the water: and he cried out, Alas! master: and it was hidden.
012	2KI	006	006	And the man of God said, Where did it fall? and he shewed him the place: and he broke off a stick, and threw it in there, and the iron came to the surface.
012	2KI	006	007	And he said, Take it up to thyself. And he stretched out his hand, and took it.
012	2KI	006	008	And the king of Syria was at war with Israel: and he consulted with his servants, saying, I will encamp in such a place.
012	2KI	006	009	And Elisaie sent to the king of Israel, saying, Take heed that thou pass not by that place, for the Syrians are hidden there.
012	2KI	006	010	And the king of Israel sent to the place which Elisaie mentioned to him, and saved himself thence not once or twice.
012	2KI	006	011	And the mind of the king of Syria was very much disturbed concerning this thing; and he called his servants, and said to them, Will ye not tell me who betrays me to the king of Israel?
012	2KI	006	012	And one of his servants said, Nay, my Lord, O king, for Elisaie the prophet that is in Israel reports to the king of Israel all the words whatsoever thou mayest say in thy bedchamber.
012	2KI	006	013	And he said, Go, see where this man [is], and I will send and take him. And they sent word to him, saying, Behold, [he is] in Dothaim.
012	2KI	006	014	And he sent thither horses, and chariots, and a mighty host: and they came by night, and compassed about the city.
012	2KI	006	015	And the servant of Elisaie rose up early and went out; and, behold, a host compassed the city, and horses and chariots: and the servant said to him, O master, what shall we do?
012	2KI	006	016	And Elisaie said, Fear not, for they who are with us [are] more than they that are with them.
012	2KI	006	017	And Elisaie prayed, and said, Lord, open, I pray thee, the eyes of the servant, and let him see. And the Lord opened his eyes, and he saw: and, behold, the mountain [was] full of horses, and there were chariots of fire round about Elisaie.
012	2KI	006	018	And they came down to him; and he prayed to the Lord, and said, Smite, I pray thee, this people with blindness. And he smote them with blindness, according to the word of Elisaie.
012	2KI	006	019	And Elisaie said to them, This [is] not the city, and this [is] not the way: follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom ye seek. And he led them away to Samaria.
012	2KI	006	020	And it came to pass when they entered into Samaria, that Elisaie said, Open, I pray thee, O Lord, their eyes, and let them see. And the Lord opened their eyes, and they saw; and, behold, they were in the midst of Samaria.
012	2KI	006	021	And the king of Israel said to Elisaie, when he saw them, Shall I [not] verily smite them, [my] father?
012	2KI	006	022	And he said, Thou shalt not smite them, unless thou wouldest smite those whom thou hast taken captive with thy sword and with thy bow: set bread and water before them, and let them eat and drink, and depart to their master.
012	2KI	006	023	And he set before them a great feast, and they ate and drank: and he dismissed them and they departed to their master. And the bands of Syria came no longer into the land of Israel.
012	2KI	006	024	And it came to pass after this, that the son of Ader king of Syria gathered all his army, and went up, and besieged Samaria.
012	2KI	006	025	And there was a great famine in Samaria: and, behold, they besieged it, until an ass's head was [valued] at fifty pieces of silver, and the fourth part of a cab of dove's dung at five pieces of silver.
012	2KI	006	026	And the king of Israel was passing by on the wall, and a woman cried to him, saying, Help, my lord, O king.
012	2KI	006	027	And he said to her, Unless the Lord help thee, whence shall I help thee? from the corn-floor, or from the wine-press?
012	2KI	006	028	And the king said to her, What is [the matter] with thee? And the woman said to him, This [woman] said to me, Give thy son, and we will eat him to-day, and we will eat my son to-morrow.
012	2KI	006	029	So we boiled my son, and ate him; and I said to her on the second day, Give thy son, and let us eat him: and she has hidden her son.
012	2KI	006	030	And it came to pass, when the king of Israel heard the words of the woman, [that] he rent his garments; and he passed by on the wall, and the people saw sackcloth within upon his flesh.
012	2KI	006	031	And he said, God do so to me and more also, if the head of Elisaie shall stand upon him this day.
012	2KI	006	032	And Elisaie was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him; and [the king] sent a man before him: before the messenger came to him, he also said to the elders, Do ye see that this son of a murderer has sent to take away my head? See, as soon as the messenger shall have come, shut the door, and forcibly detain him at the door: [is] not the sound of his master's feet behind him?
012	2KI	006	033	While he was yet speaking with them, behold, a messenger came to him: and he said, Behold, this evil [is] of the Lord; why should I wait for the Lord any longer?
012	2KI	007	001	And Elisaie said, Hear thou the word of the Lord; Thus saith the Lord, As at this time, to-morrow a measure of fine flour [shall be sold] for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gates of Samaria.
012	2KI	007	002	And the officer on whose hand the king rested, answered Elisaie, and said, Behold, [if] the Lord shall make flood-gates in heaven, might this thing be? and Elisaie said, Behold, thou shalt see with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof.
012	2KI	007	003	And there were four leprous men by the gate of the city: and one said to his neighbour, Why sit we here until we die?
012	2KI	007	004	If we should say, Let us go into the city, then [there is] famine in the city, and we shall die there: and if we sit here, then we shall die. Now then come, and let us fall upon the camp of the Syrians: if they should take us alive, then we shall live; and if they should put us to death, then we shall [only] die.
012	2KI	007	005	And they rose up while it was yet night, to go into the camp of Syria; and they came into a part of the camp of Syria, and behold, there [was] no man there.
012	2KI	007	006	For the Lord had made the army of Syria to hear a sound of chariots, and a sound of horses, [even] the sound of a great host: and [each] man said to his fellow, Now has the king of Israel hired against us the kings of the Chettites, and the kings of Egypt, to come against us.
012	2KI	007	007	And they arose and fled while it was yet dark, and left their tents, and their horses, and their asses in the camp, as they were, and fled for their lives.
012	2KI	007	008	And these lepers entered a little way into the camp, and went into one tent, and ate and drank, and took thence silver, and gold, and raiment; and they went and returned thence, and entered into another tent, and took thence, and went and hid [the spoil].
012	2KI	007	009	And [one] man said to his neighbour, We are not doing [well] thus: this day is a day of glad tidings, and we hold our peace, and are waiting till the morning light, and shall find mischief: now them come, and let us go into [the city], and report to the house of the king.
012	2KI	007	010	So they went and cried toward the gate of the city, and reported to them, saying, We went into the camp of Syria, and, behold, there is not there a man, nor voice of man, only horses tied and asses, and their tents as they were.
012	2KI	007	011	And the porters cried aloud, and reported to the house of the king within.
012	2KI	007	012	And the king rose up by night, and said to his servants, I will now tell you what the Syrians have done to us. They knew that we are hungry; and they have gone forth from the camp and hidden themselves in the field, saying, They will come out of the city, and we shall catch them alive, and go into the city.
012	2KI	007	013	And one of his servants answered and said, Let them now take five of the horses that were left, which were left here; behold, they are the number left to all the multitude of Israel; and we will send thither and see.
012	2KI	007	014	So they took two horsemen; and the king of Israel sent after the king of Syria, saying, Go, and see.
012	2KI	007	015	And they went after them even to Jordan: and, behold, all the way was full of garments and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away in their panic. and the messengers returned, and brought word to the king.
012	2KI	007	016	And the people went out, and plundered the camp of Syria: and a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel, according to the word of the Lord, and two measures of barley for a shekel.
012	2KI	007	017	And the king appointed the officer on whose hand the king leaned [to have charge] over the gate: and the people trampled on him in the gate, and he died, as the man of God [had] said, who spoke when the messenger came down to him.
012	2KI	007	018	So it came to pass as Elisaie had spoken to the king, saying, Two measures of barley [shall be sold] for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a shekel; and it shall be as at this time to-morrow in the gate of Samaria.
012	2KI	007	019	And the officer answered Elisaie, and said, Behold, [if] the Lord makes flood-gates in heaven, shall this thing be? and Elisaie said, Behold, thou shalt see [it] with thine eyes, but thou shalt not eat thereof.
012	2KI	007	020	And it was so: for the people trampled on him in the gate, and he died.
012	2KI	008	001	And Elisaie spoke to the woman, whose son he [had] restored to life, saying, Arise, and go thou and thy house, and sojourn wherever thou mayest sojourn: for the Lord has called for a famine upon the land; indeed it is come upon the land [for] seven years.
012	2KI	008	002	And the woman arose, and did according to the word of Elisaie, both she and her house; and they sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years.
012	2KI	008	003	And it came to pass after the expiration of the seven years, that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines to the city; and came to cry to the king for her house and for her lands.
012	2KI	008	004	And the king spoke to Giezi the servant of Elisaie the man of God, saying, Tell me, I pray thee, all the great things which Elisaie has done.
012	2KI	008	005	And it came to pass, as he was telling the king how he had restored to life the dead son, behold, the woman whose son Elisaie restored to life [came] crying to the king for her house and for her lands. And Giezi said, My lord, O king, this [is] the woman, and this [is] her son, whom Elisaie restored to life.
012	2KI	008	006	And the king asked the woman, and she told him: and the king appointed her a eunuch, saying, Restore all that was hers, and all the fruits of the field from the day that she left the land until now.
012	2KI	008	007	And Elisaie came to Damascus; and the king of Syria the son of Ader was ill, and they brought him word, saying, The man of God is come hither.
012	2KI	008	008	And the king said to Azael, Take in thine hand a present, and go to meet the man of God, and enquire of the Lord by him, saying, Shall I recover of this my disease?
012	2KI	008	009	And Azael went to meet him, and he took a present in his hand, and all the good things of Damascus, forty camels' load, and came and stood before him, and said to Elisaie, Thy son the son of Ader, the king of Syria, has sent me to thee to enquire, saying, Shall I recover of this my disease?
012	2KI	008	010	And Elisaie said, Go, say, Thou shalt certainly live; yet the Lord has shewed me that thou shalt surely die.
012	2KI	008	011	And he stood before him, and fixed [his countenance] till he was ashamed: and the man of God wept.
012	2KI	008	012	And Azael said, Why does my lord weep? And he said, Because I know all the evil that thou wilt do to the children of Israel: thou wilt utterly destroy their strong holds with fire, and thou wilt slay their choice men with the sword, and thou wilt dash their infants [against the ground], and their women with child thou wilt rip up.
012	2KI	008	013	And Azael said, Who is thy servant? a dead dog, that he should do this thing? And Elisaie said, The Lord has shewn me thee ruling over Syria.
012	2KI	008	014	And he departed from Elisaie, and went in to his lord; and he said to him, What said Elisaie to thee? and he said, He said to me, Thou shalt surely live.
012	2KI	008	015	And it came to pass on the next day that he took a thick cloth, and dipped it in water, and put it on his face, and he died: and Azael reigned in his stead.
012	2KI	008	016	In the fifth year of Joram son of Achaab king of Israel, and while Josaphat was king of Juda, Joram the son of Josaphat king of Juda began to reign.
012	2KI	008	017	Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.
012	2KI	008	018	And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Achaab; for the daughter of Achaab was his wife: and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord.
012	2KI	008	019	But the Lord would not destroy Juda for David his servant's sake, as he said he would give a light to him and to his sons continually.
012	2KI	008	020	In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Juda, and they made a king over themselves.
012	2KI	008	021	And Joram went up to Sior, and all the chariots that were with him: and it came to pass after he had arisen, that he smote Edom who compassed him about, and the captains of the chariots; and the people fled to their tents.
012	2KI	008	022	Yet Edom revolted from under the hand of Juda till this day. Then Lobna revolted at that time.
012	2KI	008	023	And the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, behold, are not these written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Juda?
012	2KI	008	024	So Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of his father David: and Ochozias his son reigned in his stead.
012	2KI	008	025	In the twelfth year of Joram son of Achaab king of Israel, Ochozias son of Joram began to reign.
012	2KI	008	026	Twenty and two years old [was] Ochozias when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem: and the name of his mother [was] Gotholia, daughter of Ambri king of Israel.
012	2KI	008	027	And he walked in the way of the house of Achaab, and did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, as did the house of Achaab.
012	2KI	008	028	And he went with Joram the son of Achaab to war against Azael king of the Syrians in Remmoth Galaad; and the Syrians wounded Joram.
012	2KI	008	029	And king Joram returned to be healed in Jezrael of the wounds with which they wounded him in Remmoth, when he fought with Azael king of Syria. And Ochozias son of Joram went down to see Joram the son of Achaab in Jezrael, because he was sick.
012	2KI	009	001	And Elisaie the prophet called one of the sons of the prophets, and said to him, Gird up thy loins, and take this cruse of oil in thy hand, and go to Remmoth Galaad.
012	2KI	009	002	And thou shalt enter there, and shalt see there Ju the son of Josaphat son of Namessi, and shalt go in and make him rise up from among his brethren, and shalt bring him into a secret chamber.
012	2KI	009	003	And thou shalt take the cruse of oil, and pour [it] on his head, and say thou, Thus saith the Lord, I have anointed thee king over Israel: and thou shalt open the door, and flee, and not tarry.
012	2KI	009	004	And the young man the prophet went to Remmoth Galaad.
012	2KI	009	005	And he went in, and, behold, the captains of the host were sitting; and he said, I have a message to thee, O captain. And Ju said, To which of all us? And he said, To thee, O captain.
012	2KI	009	006	And he arose, and went into the house: and he poured the oil upon his head, and said to him, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, I have anointed thee to be king over the people of the Lord, even over Israel.
012	2KI	009	007	And thou shalt utterly destroy the house of Achaab thy master from before me, and shalt avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the Lord, at the hand of Jezabel,
012	2KI	009	008	and at the hand of the whole house of Achaab: and thou shalt utterly cut off from the house of Achaab every male, and him that is shut up and left in Israel.
012	2KI	009	009	And I will make the house of Achaab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, and as the house of Baasa the son of Achia.
012	2KI	009	010	And the dogs shall eat Jezabel in the portion of Jezreel, and there shall be none to bury her. And he opened the door, and fled.
012	2KI	009	011	And Ju went forth to the servants of his lord, and they said to him, [Is] all well? Why came this mad fellow in to thee? And he said to them, Ye know the man, and his communication.
012	2KI	009	012	And they said, [It is] wrong: tell us now. And Ju said to them, Thus and thus spoke he to me, saying, —and he said, Thus saith the Lord, I have anointed thee to be king over Israel.
012	2KI	009	013	And when they heard it, they hasted, and took every man his garment, and put it under him on the top of the stairs, and blew with the trumpet, and said, Ju is king.
012	2KI	009	014	So Ju the son of Josaphat the son of Namessi conspired against Joram, and Joram was defending Remmoth Galaad, he and all Israel, because of Azael king of Syria.
012	2KI	009	015	And king Joram had returned to be healed in Jezrael of the wounds which the Syrians had given him, in his war with Azael king of Syria. And Ju said, If your heart is with me, let there not go forth out of the city one fugitive to go and report to Jezrael.
012	2KI	009	016	And Ju rode and advanced, and came down to Jezrael; for Joram king of Israel was getting healed in Jezrael of the arrow-wounds wherewith the Syrians [had] wounded him in Rammath in the war with Azael king of Syria; for he [was] strong and a mighty man: and Ochozias king of Juda was come down to see Joram.
012	2KI	009	017	And there went up a watchman upon the tower of Jezrael, and saw the dust [made by] Ju as he approached; and he said, I see dust. And Joram said, Take a horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, Peace.
012	2KI	009	018	And there went a horseman to meet them, and said, Thus says the king, Peace. And Ju said, What hast thou to do with peace? turn behind me. And the watchman reported, saying, The messenger came up to them, and has not returned.
012	2KI	009	019	And he sent another horseman, and he came to him, and said, Thus says the king, Peace. And Ju said, What hast thou to do with peace? turn behind me.
012	2KI	009	020	And the watchman reported, saying, He came up to them, and has not returned: and the driver drives Ju the son of Namessi, for it is with furious [haste].
012	2KI	009	021	And Joram said, Make ready. And one made ready the chariot: and Joram the king of Israel went forth, and Ochozias king of Juda, each in his chariot, and they went to meet Ju, and found him in the portion of Nabuthai the Jezraelite.
012	2KI	009	022	And it came to pass when Joram saw Ju, that he said, [Is it] peace, Ju? And Ju said, How [can it be] peace? as yet [there are] the whoredoms of thy mother Jezabel, and her abundant witchcrafts.
012	2KI	009	023	And Joram turned his hands, and fled, and said to Ochozias, Treachery, Ochozias.
012	2KI	009	024	And Ju bent his bow with his full strength, and smote Joram between his arms, and his arrow went out at his heart, and he bowed upon his knees.
012	2KI	009	025	And [Ju] said to Badecar his chief officer, Cast him into the portion of ground of Nabuthai the Jezraelite, for I and thou remember, riding [as we were] on chariots after Achaab his father, that the Lord took up this burden against him, [saying],
012	2KI	009	026	Surely, I have seen yesterday the blood of Nabuthai, and the blood of his sons, saith the Lord; and I will recompense him in this portion, saith the Lord. Now then, I pray thee, take him up and cast him into the portion, according to the word of the Lord.
012	2KI	009	027	And Ochozias king of Juda saw [it], and fled by the way of Baethgan. And Ju pursued after him, and said, [Slay] him also. And one smote him in the chariot at the going up of Gai, which is Jeblaam: and he fled to Mageddo, and died there.
012	2KI	009	028	And his servants put him on a chariot, and brought him to Jerusalem, and they buried him in his sepulchre in the city of David.
012	2KI	009	029	And in the eleventh year of Joram king of Israel, Ochozias began to reign over Juda.
012	2KI	009	030	And Ju came to Jezrael; and Jezabel heard [of it], and coloured her eyes, and adorned her head, and looked through the window.
012	2KI	009	031	And Ju entered into the city; and she said, Had Zambri, the murderer of his master, peace?
012	2KI	009	032	And he lifted up his face toward the window, and saw her, and said, Who art thou? Come down with me. And two eunuchs looked down towards him.
012	2KI	009	033	And he said, Throw her [down]. And they threw her [down]; and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses: and they trampled on her.
012	2KI	009	034	And [Ju] went in and ate and drank, and said, Look now, after this cursed woman, and bury her, for she is a king's daughter.
012	2KI	009	035	And they went to bury her; but they found nothing of her but the skull, and the feet, and the palms of her hands.
012	2KI	009	036	And they returned and told him. And he said, [It is] the word of the Lord, which he spoke by the hand of Eliu the Thesbite, saying, In the portion of Jezrael shall the dogs eat the flesh of Jezabel.
012	2KI	009	037	And the carcass of Jezabel shall be as dung on the face of the field in the portion of Jezrael, so that they shall not say, [This is] Jezabel.
012	2KI	010	001	And Achaab [had] seventy sons in Samaria. And Ju wrote a letter, and sent it into Samaria to the rulers of Samaria, and to the elders, and to the guardians of [the children of] Achaab, saying.
012	2KI	010	002	Now then, as soon as this letter shall have reached you, whereas [there are] with you the sons of your master, and with you chariots and horses, and strong cities, and arms,
012	2KI	010	003	do ye accordingly look out the best and fittest among your master's sons, and set him on the throne of his father, and fight for the house of your master.
012	2KI	010	004	And they feared greatly, and said, Behold, two kings stood not before him: and how shall we stand?
012	2KI	010	005	So they that were over the house, and they that were over the city, and the elders and the guardians, sent to Ju, saying, We also [are] thy servants, and whatsoever thou shalt say to us we will do; we will not make [any] man king: we will do that which is right in thine eyes.
012	2KI	010	006	And Ju wrote them a second letter, saying, If ye [are] for me, and hearken to my voice, take the heads of the men your master's sons, and bring [them] to me at this time to-morrow in Jezrael. Now the sons of the king were seventy men; these great men of the city brought them up.
012	2KI	010	007	And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took the king's sons, and slew them, [even] seventy men, and put their heads in baskets, and sent them to him at Jezrael.
012	2KI	010	008	And a messenger came and told [him], saying, They have brought the heads of the king's sons. And he said, Lay them [in] two heaps by the door of the gate until the morning.
012	2KI	010	009	And the morning came, and he went forth, and stood, and said to all the people, Ye are righteous: behold, I conspired against my master, and slew him: but who slew all these?
012	2KI	010	010	See now that there shall not fall to the ground anything of the word of the Lord which the Lord spoke against the house of Achaab: for the Lord has performed all that he spoke of by the hand of his servant Eliu.
012	2KI	010	011	And Ju smote all that were left of the house of Achaab in Jezrael, and all his great men, and his acquaintance, and his priests, so as not to leave him [any] remnant.
012	2KI	010	012	And he arose and went to Samaria, [and] he [was] in the house of sheep-shearing in the way.
012	2KI	010	013	And Ju found the brethren of Ochozias king of Juda, and said, Who [are] ye? And they said, We [are] the brethren of Ochozias, and we have come down to salute the sons of the king, and the sons of the queen.
012	2KI	010	014	And he said, Take them alive. And they slew them at the shearing-house, forty and two men: he left not a man of them.
012	2KI	010	015	And he went thence and found Jonadab the son of Rechab [coming] to meet him; and he saluted him, and Ju said to him, Is thy heart right with my heart, as my heart [is] with thy heart? And Jonadab said, It is. And Ju said, If it is then, give me thy hand. And he gave him his hand, and he took him up to him into the chariot.
012	2KI	010	016	And he said to him, Come with me, and see me zealous for the Lord. And he caused him to sit in his chariot.
012	2KI	010	017	And he entered into Samaria, and smote all that were left of Achaab in Samaria, until he had utterly destroyed him, according to the word of the Lord, which he spoke to Eliu.
012	2KI	010	018	And Ju gathered all the people, and said to them, Achaab served Baal a little; Ju shall serve him much.
012	2KI	010	019	Now then do all [ye] the prophets of Baal call all his servants and his priests to me; let not a man be wanting: for I have a great sacrifice [to offer] to Baal; every one who shall be missing shall die. But Ju did it in subtilty, that he might destroy the servants of Baal.
012	2KI	010	020	And Ju said, Sanctify a solemn festival to Baal, and they made a proclamation.
012	2KI	010	021	And Ju sent throughout all Israel, saying, Now then let all [Baal's] servants, and all his priests, and all his prophets [come], let none be lacking: for I am going to offer a great sacrifice; whosoever shall be missing, shall not live. So all the servants of Baal came, and all his priests, and all his prophets: there was not one left who came not. And they entered into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was filled from one end to the other.
012	2KI	010	022	And he said to the man who was over the house of the wardrobe, Bring forth a robe for all the servants of Baal. And the keeper of the robes brought forth to them.
012	2KI	010	023	And Ju and Jonadab the son of Rechab entered into the house of Baal, and said to the servants of Baal, Search, and see whether there is among you any of the servants of the Lord, or only the servants of Baal, by themselves.
012	2KI	010	024	And he went in to offer sacrifices and whole-burnt-offerings; and Ju set for himself eighty men without, and said, Every man who shall escape of the men whom I bring into your hand, the life of him [that spares him] shall go for his life.
012	2KI	010	025	And it came to pass, when he had finished offering the whole-burnt-offering, that Ju said to the footmen and to the officers, Go ye in and slay them; let not a man of them escape. So they smote them with the edge of the sword, and the footmen and the officers cast [the bodies] forth, and went to the city of the house of Baal.
012	2KI	010	026	And they brought out the pillar of Baal, and burnt it.
012	2KI	010	027	And they tore down the pillars of Baal, and made his house a draught-house until this day.
012	2KI	010	028	So Ju abolished Baal out of Israel.
012	2KI	010	029	Nevertheless Ju departed not from following the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, who led Israel to sin: [these were] the golden heifers in Baethel and in Dan.
012	2KI	010	030	And the Lord said to Ju, Because of all thy deeds wherein thou hast acted well in doing that which was right in my eyes, according to all things which thou hast done to the house of Achaab [as they were] in my heart, thy sons to the fourth generation shall sit upon the throne of Israel.
012	2KI	010	031	But Ju took no heed to walk in the law of the Lord God of Israel with all his heart: he departed not from following the sins of Jeroboam, who made Israel to sin.
012	2KI	010	032	In those days the Lord began to cut Israel short; and Azael smote them in every coast of Israel;
012	2KI	010	033	from Jordan eastward all the land of Galaad belonging to the Gadites, of Gaddi and that of Ruben, and of Manasses, from Aroer, which is on the brink of the brook of Arnon, and Galaad and Basan.
012	2KI	010	034	And the rest of the acts of Ju, and all that he did, and all his might, and the wars wherein he engaged, [are] not these things written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
012	2KI	010	035	And Ju slept with his fathers; and they buried him in Samaria: and Joachaz his son reigned in his stead.
012	2KI	010	036	And the days which Ju reigned over Israel [were] twenty-eight years in Samaria.
012	2KI	011	001	And Gotholia the mother of Ochozias saw that her son was dead, and she destroyed all the seed royal.
012	2KI	011	002	And Josabee daughter of king Joram, sister of Ochozias, took Joas the son of her brother, and stole him from among the king's sons that were put to death, [secreting] him and his nurse in the bedchamber, and hid him from the face of Gotholia, and he was not slain.
012	2KI	011	003	And he remained with her hid in the house of the Lord six years: and Gotholia reigned over the land.
012	2KI	011	004	And in the seventh year Jodae sent and took the captains of hundreds of the Chorri and of the Rhasim, and brought them to him into the house of the Lord, and made a covenant of the Lord with them, and adjured them, and Jodae shewed them the king's son.
012	2KI	011	005	And charged them, saying, This [is] the thing which ye shall do.
012	2KI	011	006	Let a third part of you go in [on] the sabbath-day, and keep ye the watch of the king's house in the porch; and another third in the gate of the high way, and a third at the gate behind the footmen; and keep ye the guard of the house.
012	2KI	011	007	And there [shall be] two parties among you, even every one that goes out on the Sabbath, and they shall keep the guard of the Lord's house before the king.
012	2KI	011	008	And do ye compass the king about every man with his weapon in his hand, and he that goes into the ranges shall die: and they shall be with the king in his going out and in his coming in.
012	2KI	011	009	And the captains of hundreds did all things that the wise Jodae commanded; and they took each his men, both those that went in on the sabbath-day, and those that went out on the sabbath-day, and went in to Jodae the priest.
012	2KI	011	010	And the priest gave to the captains of hundreds the swords and spears of king David that were in the house of the Lord.
012	2KI	011	011	And the footmen stood each with his weapon in his hand from the right corner of the house to the left corner of the house, [by] the altar and the house round about the king.
012	2KI	011	012	And he brought forth the king's son, and put upon him the crown and [gave him] the testimony; and he made him king, and anointed him: and they clapped [their] hands, and said, Long live the king.
012	2KI	011	013	And Gotholia heard the sound of the people running, and she went in to the people to the house of the Lord.
012	2KI	011	014	And she looked, and, behold, the king stood near a pillar according to the manner; and the singers and the trumpeters were before the king and all the people of the land [even] rejoicing and sounding with trumpets: and Gotholia rent her garments, and cried, A conspiracy, a conspiracy.
012	2KI	011	015	And Jodae the priest commanded the captains of hundreds who were over the host, and said to them, Bring her forth without the ranges, [and] he that goes in after her shall certainly die by the sword. For the priest said, Let her not however be slain in the house of the Lord.
012	2KI	011	016	And they laid hands upon her, and went in by the way of the horses' entrance into the house of the Lord, and she was slain there.
012	2KI	011	017	And Jodae made a covenant between the Lord and the king and the people, that they should be the Lord's people; also between the king and the people.
012	2KI	011	018	And all the people of the land went into the house of Baal, and tore it down, and completely broke in pieces his altars and his images, and they slew Mathan the priest of Baal before the altars. And the priest appointed overseers over the house of the Lord.
012	2KI	011	019	And he took the captains of the hundreds, and the Chorri, and the Rhasim, and all the people of the land, and brought down the king out of the house of the Lord; and they went in by the way of the gate of the footmen of the king's house, and seated him there on the throne of the kings.
012	2KI	011	020	And all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was at rest: and they slew Gotholia with the sword in the house of the king.
012	2KI	011	021	Joas [was] seven years old when he began to reign.
012	2KI	012	001	Joas began to reign in the seventh year of Ju, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name [was] Sabia of Bersabee.
012	2KI	012	002	And Joas did that which was right in the sight of the Lord all the days that Jodae the priest instructed him.
012	2KI	012	003	Only there were not [any] of the high places removed, and the people still sacrificed there, and burned incense on the high places.
012	2KI	012	004	And Joas said to the priests, [As for] all the money of the holy things that is brought into the house of the Lord, the money of valuation, [as] each man brings the money of valuation, all the money which any man may feel disposed to bring into the house of the Lord,
012	2KI	012	005	let the priests take it to themselves, every man from [the proceeds of] his sale: and they shall repair the breaches of the house in all [places] wheresoever a breach shall be found.
012	2KI	012	006	And it came to pass in the twenty-third year of king Joas the priests [had] not repaired the breaches of the house.
012	2KI	012	007	And king Joas called Jodae the priest, and the [other] priests, and said to them, Why have ye not repaired the breaches of the house? now then receive no [more] money from your sales, for ye shall give it to [repair the] breaches of the house.
012	2KI	012	008	And the priests consented to receive no more money of the people, and not to repair the breaches of the house.
012	2KI	012	009	And Jodae the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in the lid of it, and set it by the altar in the house of a man [belonging to] the house of the Lord, and the priests that kept the door put [therein] all the money that was found in the house of the Lord.
012	2KI	012	010	And it came to pass, when they saw that [there was] much money in the chest, that the king's scribe and the high priest went up, and they tied up and counted the money that was found in the house of the Lord.
012	2KI	012	011	And they gave the money that had been collected into the hands of them that wrought the works, the overseers of the house of the Lord; and they gave it out to the carpenters and to the builders that wrought in the house of the Lord.
012	2KI	012	012	And to the masons, and to the hewers of stone, to purchase timber and hewn stone to repair the breaches of the house of the Lord, for all that was spent on the house of the Lord to repair [it].
012	2KI	012	013	Only there were not to be made for the house of the Lord silver plates, studs, bowls, or trumpets, any vessel of gold or vessel of silver, of the money that was brought into the house of the Lord:
012	2KI	012	014	for they were to give it to the workmen, and they repaired therewith the house of the Lord.
012	2KI	012	015	Also they took no account of the men into whose hands they gave the money to give to the workmen, for they acted faithfully.
012	2KI	012	016	Money for a sin-offering, and money for a trespass-offering, whatever happened to be brought into the house of the Lord, went to the priests.
012	2KI	012	017	Then went up Azael king of Syria, and fought against Geth, and took it: and Azael set his face to go against Jerusalem.
012	2KI	012	018	And Joas king of Juda took all the holy things which Josaphat, and Joram, Ochozias, his fathers, and kings of Juda [had] consecrated, and what he had himself dedicated, and all the gold that was found in the treasures of the Lord's house and the king's house, and he sent [them] to Azael king of Syria; and he went up from Jerusalem.
012	2KI	012	019	And the rest of the acts of Joas, and all that he did, behold, [are] not these things written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Juda?
012	2KI	012	020	And his servants rose up and made a conspiracy, and smote Joas in the house of Mallo that is in Sela.
012	2KI	012	021	And Jezirchar the son of Jemuath, and Jezabuth Somer's son, his servants, smote him, and he died; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David: and Amessias his son reigned in his stead.
012	2KI	013	001	In the twenty-third year of Joas son of Ochozias king of Juda began Joachaz the son of Ju to reign in Samaria, [and he reigned] seventeen years.
012	2KI	013	002	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, and walked after the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, who led Israel to sin; he departed not from them.
012	2KI	013	003	And the Lord was very angry with Israel, and delivered them into the hand of Azael king of Syria, and into the hand of the son of Ader son of Azael, all their days.
012	2KI	013	004	And Joachaz besought the Lord, and the Lord hearkened to him, for he saw the affliction of Israel, because the king of Syria afflicted them.
012	2KI	013	005	And the Lord gave deliverance to Israel, and they escaped from under the hand of Syria: and the children of Israel dwelt in their tents as heretofore.
012	2KI	013	006	Only they departed not from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, who led Israel to sin: they walked in them—moreover the grove also remained in Samaria.
012	2KI	013	007	Whereas there was not left any army to Joachaz, except fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand infantry: for the king of Syria had destroyed them, and they made them as dust for trampling.
012	2KI	013	008	And the rest of the acts of Joachaz, and all that he did, and his mighty acts [are] not these things written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
012	2KI	013	009	And Joachaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in Samaria: and Joas his son reigned in his stead.
012	2KI	013	010	In the thirty-seventh year of Joas king of Juda, Joas the son of Joachaz began to reign over Israel in Samaria sixteen years.
012	2KI	013	011	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord; he departed not from all the sin of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, who led Israel to sin: he walked in it.
012	2KI	013	012	And the rest of the acts of Joas, and all that he did, and his mighty acts which he performed together with Amessias king of Juda, [are] not these written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
012	2KI	013	013	And Joas slept with his fathers, and Jeroboam sat upon his throne, and he was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.
012	2KI	013	014	Now Elisaie was sick of his sickness, whereof he died: and Joas king of Israel went down to him, and wept over his face, and said, [My] father, [my] father, the chariot of Israel, and the horseman thereof!
012	2KI	013	015	And Elisaie said to him, Take bow and arrows. And he took to himself a bow and arrows.
012	2KI	013	016	And he said to the king, Put thy hand on the bow. And Joas put his hand upon [it]: and Elisaie put his hands upon the king's hands.
012	2KI	013	017	And he said, Open the window eastward. And he opened it. And Elisaie said, Shoot. And he shot. And [Elisaie] said, The arrow of the Lord's deliverance, and the arrow of deliverance from Syria; and thou shalt smite the Syrians in Aphec until thou have consumed them.
012	2KI	013	018	And Elisaie said to him, Take bow and arrows. And he took them. And [he] said to the king of Israel, Smite upon the ground. And the king smote three times, and stayed.
012	2KI	013	019	And the man of God was grieved at him, and said, If thou hadst smitten five or six times, then thou shouldest have smitten Syria till thou hadst consumed them; but now thou shalt smite Syria [only] thrice.
012	2KI	013	020	And Elisaie died, and they buried him. And the bands of the Moabites came into the land, at the beginning of the year.
012	2KI	013	021	And it came to pass as they were burying a man, that behold, they saw a band [of men], and they cast the man into the grave of Elisaie: and as soon as he touched the bones of Elisaie, he revived and stood up on his feet.
012	2KI	013	022	And Azael greatly afflicted Israel all the days of Joachaz.
012	2KI	013	023	And the Lord had mercy and compassion upon them, and had respect to them because of his covenant with Abraam, and Isaac, and Jacob; and the Lord would not destroy them, and did not cast them out from his presence.
012	2KI	013	024	And Azael king of Syria died, and the son of Ader his son reigned in his stead.
012	2KI	013	025	And Joas the son of Joachaz returned, and took the cities out of the hand of the son of Ader the son of Azael, which he had taken out of the hand of Joachaz his father in the war: thrice did Joas smite him, and he recovered the cities of Israel.
012	2KI	014	001	In the second year of Joas the son of Joachaz king of Israel, did Amessias also the son of Joas the king of Juda begin to reign.
012	2KI	014	002	Twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name [was] Joadim of Jerusalem.
012	2KI	014	003	And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, but not as David his father: he did according to all things that his father Joas did.
012	2KI	014	004	Only he removed not the high places: as yet the people sacrificed and burnt incense on the high places.
012	2KI	014	005	And it came to pass when the kingdom was established in his hand, that he slew his servants that had slain the king his father.
012	2KI	014	006	But he slew not the sons of those that had slain him; according as it is written in the book of the laws of Moses, as the Lord gave commandment, saying, The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, and the children shall not be put to death for the fathers; but every one shall die for his own sins.
012	2KI	014	007	He smote of Edom ten thousand in the valley of salt, and took the Rock in the war, and called its name Jethoel until this day.
012	2KI	014	008	Then Amessias sent messengers to Joas son of Joachaz son of Ju king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one another in the face.
012	2KI	014	009	And Joas the king of Israel sent to Amessias king of Juda, saying, The thistle that was in Libanus sent to the cedar that was in Libanus, saying, Give my daughter to thy son to wife: and the wild beasts of the field that were in Libanus passed by and trod down the thistle.
012	2KI	014	010	Thou hast smitten and wounded Edom, and thy heart has lifted thee up: stay at home and glorify thyself; for wherefore art thou quarrelsome to thy hurt? So [both] thou wilt fall and Juda with thee.
012	2KI	014	011	Nevertheless Amessias hearkened not: so Joas king of Israel went up, and he and Amessias king of Juda looked one another in the face in Baethsamys of Juda.
012	2KI	014	012	And Juda was overthrown before Israel, and [every] man fled to his tent.
012	2KI	014	013	And Joas king of Israel took Amessias the son of Joas the son of Ochozias, in Baethsamys; and he came to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem, [beginning] at the gate of Ephraim as far as the gate of the corner, four hundred cubits.
012	2KI	014	014	And he took the gold, and the silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of the Lord, and in the treasures of the king's house, and the hostages, and returned to Samaria.
012	2KI	014	015	And the rest of the acts of Joas, [even] all that he did in his might, how he warred with Amessias king of Juda, are not these things written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
012	2KI	014	016	And Joas slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel; and Jeroboam his son reigned in his stead.
012	2KI	014	017	And Amessias the son of Joas king of Juda lived after the death of Joas son of Joachaz king of Israel fifteen years.
012	2KI	014	018	And the rest of the acts of Amessias, and all that he did, [are] not these written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Juda?
012	2KI	014	019	And they formed a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachis: and they sent after him to Lachis, and slew him there.
012	2KI	014	020	And they brought him upon horses; and he was buried in Jerusalem with his fathers in the city of David.
012	2KI	014	021	And all the people of Juda took Azarias, and he was sixteen years old, and made him king in the room of his father Amessias.
012	2KI	014	022	He built Aeloth, and restored it to Juda, after the king slept with his fathers.
012	2KI	014	023	In the fifteenth year of Amessias son of Joas king of Juda began Jeroboam son of Joas to reign over Israel in Samaria forty and one years.
012	2KI	014	024	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord: he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, who led Israel to sin.
012	2KI	014	025	He recovered the coast of Israel from the entering in of Aemath to the sea of Araba, according to the word of the Lord God of Israel, which he spoke by his servant Jonas the son of Amathi, the prophet of Gethchopher.
012	2KI	014	026	For the Lord saw [that] the affliction of Israel [was] very bitter, and that they were few in number, straitened and in want, and destitute, and Israel had no helper.
012	2KI	014	027	And the Lord said that he would not blot out the seed of Israel from under heaven; so he delivered them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joas.
012	2KI	014	028	And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam and all that he did, and his mighty deeds, which he achieved in war, and how he recovered Damascus and Aemath to Juda in Israel, [are] not these things written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
012	2KI	014	029	And Jeroboam slept with his fathers, even with the kings of Israel; and Zacharias his son reigned in his stead.
012	2KI	015	001	In the twenty-seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel Azarias the son of Amessias king of Juda began to reign.
012	2KI	015	002	Sixteen years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty-two years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Jechelia of Jerusalem.
012	2KI	015	003	And he did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord, according to all things that Amessias his father did.
012	2KI	015	004	Only he took not away [any] of the high places: as yet the people sacrificed and burnt incense on the high places.
012	2KI	015	005	And the Lord plagued the king, and he was leprous till the day of his death; and he reigned in a separate house. And Joatham the king's son [was] over the household, judging the people of the land.
012	2KI	015	006	And the rest of the acts of Azarias, and all that he did, [are] not these written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Juda?
012	2KI	015	007	And Azarias slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David: and Joatham his son reigned in his stead.
012	2KI	015	008	In the thirty and eighth year of Azarias king of Juda Zacharias the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in Samaria six months.
012	2KI	015	009	And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the Lord, as his fathers had done: he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, who made Israel to sin.
012	2KI	015	010	And Sellum the son of Jabis [and others] conspired against him, and they smote him [in] Keblaam, and slew him, and he reigned in his stead.
012	2KI	015	011	And the rest of the acts of Zacharias, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
012	2KI	015	012	[This was] the word of the Lord which he spoke to Ju, saying, Thy sons of the fourth generation shall sit upon the throne of Israel: and it was so.
012	2KI	015	013	And Sellum the son of Jabis reigned: and in the thirty and ninth year of Azarias king of Juda began Sellum to reign a full month in Samaria.
012	2KI	015	014	And Manaem the son of Gaddi went up out of Tharsila, and came to Samaria, and smote Sellum the son of Jabis in Samaria, and slew him.
012	2KI	015	015	And the rest of the acts of Sellum, and his conspiracy wherein he was engaged, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
012	2KI	015	016	Then Manaem smote both Thersa and all that was in it, and its borders extending beyond Thersa, because they opened not to him: and he smote it, and ripped up the women with child.
012	2KI	015	017	In the thirty and ninth year of Azarias king of Juda began Manaem the son of Gaddi to reign over Israel in Samaria ten years.
012	2KI	015	018	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord: he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, who led Israel to sin.
012	2KI	015	019	In his days went up Phua king of the Assyrians against the land: and Manaem gave to Phua a thousand talents of silver to aid him with his power.
012	2KI	015	020	And Manaem raised the silver [by a tax] upon Israel, even on every mighty man in wealth, to give to the king of the Assyrians, fifty shekels [levied] on each man; and the king of the Assyrians departed, and remained not there in the land.
012	2KI	015	021	And the rest of the acts of Manaem, and all that he did, behold, are not these written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
012	2KI	015	022	And Manaem slept with his fathers; and Phakesias his son reigned in his stead.
012	2KI	015	023	In the fiftieth year of Azarias king of Juda, began Phakesias the son of Manaem to reign over Israel in Samaria two years.
012	2KI	015	024	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, who made Israel to sin.
012	2KI	015	025	And Phakee the son of Romelias, his officer, conspired against him, and smote him in Samaria in the front of the king's house, with Argob and Aria, and with him [there were] fifty men of the four hundred: and he slew him, and reigned in his stead.
012	2KI	015	026	And the rest of the acts of Phakesias, and all that he did, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
012	2KI	015	027	In the fifty-second year of Azarias king of Juda began Phakee the son of Romelias to reign over Israel in Samaria twenty years.
012	2KI	015	028	And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the Lord: he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, who led Israel to sin.
012	2KI	015	029	In the days of Phakee king of Israel came Thalgath-phellasar king of the Assyrians, and took Ain, and Abel, and Thamaacha, and Anioch, and Kenez, and Asor, and Galaa, and Galilee, [even] all the land of Nephthali, and carried them away to the Assyrians.
012	2KI	015	030	And Osee son of Ela formed a conspiracy against Phakee the son of Romelias, and smote him, and slew him, and reigned in his stead, in the twentieth year of Joatham the son of Azarias.
012	2KI	015	031	And the rest of the acts of Phakee, and all that he did, behold, these [are] written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
012	2KI	015	032	In the second year of Phakee son of Romelias king of Israel began Joatham the son of Azarias king of Juda to reign.
012	2KI	015	033	Twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name [was] Jerusa daughter of Sadoc.
012	2KI	015	034	And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, according to all things that his father Azarias did.
012	2KI	015	035	Nevertheless he took not away the high places: as yet the people sacrificed and burnt incense on the high places. He built the upper gate of the Lord's house.
012	2KI	015	036	And the rest of the acts of Joatham, and all that he did, [are] not these written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Juda?
012	2KI	015	037	In those days the Lord began to send forth against Juda Raasson king of Syria, and Phakee son of Romelias.
012	2KI	015	038	And Joatham slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Achaz his son reigned in his stead.
012	2KI	016	001	In the seventeenth year of Phakee son of Romelias began Achaz the son of Joatham king of Juda to reign.
012	2KI	016	002	Twenty years old was Achaz when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem; and he did not that which was right in the eyes of the Lord his God faithfully, as David his father [had done].
012	2KI	016	003	And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, yea, he made his son to pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the heathen whom the Lord cast out from before the children of Israel.
012	2KI	016	004	And he sacrificed and burnt incense on the high places, and upon the hills, and under every shady tree.
012	2KI	016	005	Then went up Raasson king of Syria and Phakee son of Romelias king of Israel against Jerusalem to war, and besieged Achaz, but could not prevail [against him].
012	2KI	016	006	At that time Raasson king of Syria recovered Aelath to Syria, and drove out the Jews from Aelath, and the Idumeans came to Aelath, and dwelt there until this day.
012	2KI	016	007	And Achaz sent messengers to Thalgath-phellasar king of the Assyrians, saying, I am thy servant and thy son: come up, deliver me out of the hand of the king of Syria, and out of the hand of the king of Israel, who are rising up against me.
012	2KI	016	008	And Achaz took the silver and the gold that was found in the treasures of the house of the Lord, and of the king's house, and sent gifts to the king.
012	2KI	016	009	And the king of the Assyrians hearkened to him: and the king of the Assyrians went up to Damascus and took it, and removed the inhabitants, and slew king Raasson.
012	2KI	016	010	And king Achaz went to Damascus to meet Thalgath-phellasar king of the Assyrians at Damascus; and he saw an altar at Damascus. And king Achaz sent to Urias the priest the pattern of the altar, and its proportions, and all its workmanship.
012	2KI	016	011	And Urias the priest built the altar, according to all [the directions] which king Achaz sent from Damascus.
012	2KI	016	012	And the king saw the altar, and went up to it,
012	2KI	016	013	and offered his whole-burnt-offering, and his meat-offering, and his drink-offering, and poured out the blood of his peace-offerings on the brazen altar that was before the Lord.
012	2KI	016	014	And he brought forward [the one] before the house of the Lord from between the altar and the house of the Lord, and he set it openly by the side of the altar northwards.
012	2KI	016	015	And king Achaz charged Urias the priest, saying, Offer upon the great altar the whole-burnt-offering in the morning and the meat-offering in the evening, and the whole-burnt-offering of the king, and his meat-offering, and the whole-burnt-offering of all the people, and their meat-offering, and their drink-offering; and thou shalt pour all the blood of the whole-burnt-offering, and all the blood of [any other] sacrifice upon it: and the brazen altar shall be for me in the morning.
012	2KI	016	016	And Urias the priest did according to all that king Achaz commanded him.
012	2KI	016	017	And king Achaz cut off the borders of the bases, and removed the laver from off them, and took down the sea from the brazen oxen that were under it, and set it upon a base of stone.
012	2KI	016	018	And he made a base for the throne in the house of the Lord, and he turned the king's entrance without in the house of the Lord because of the king of the Assyrians.
012	2KI	016	019	And the rest of the acts of Achaz, even all that he did, [are] not these written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Juda?
012	2KI	016	020	And Achaz slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David: and Ezekias his son reigned in his stead.
012	2KI	017	001	In the twelfth year of Achaz king of Juda began Osee the son of Ela to reign in Samaria over Israel nine years.
012	2KI	017	002	And he did evil in the eyes of the Lord, only not as the kings of Israel that were before him.
012	2KI	017	003	Against him came up Salamanassar king of the Assyrians; and Osee became his servant, and rendered him tribute.
012	2KI	017	004	And the king of the Assyrians found iniquity in Osee, in that he sent messengers to Segor king of Egypt, and brought not a tribute to the king of the Assyrians in that year: and the king of the Assyrians besieged him, and bound him in the prison-house.
012	2KI	017	005	And the king of the Assyrians went up against all the land, and went up to Samaria, and besieged it [for] three years.
012	2KI	017	006	In the ninth year of Osee the king of the Assyrians took Samaria, and carried Israel away to the Assyrians, and settled them in Alae, and in Abor, [near] the rivers of Gozan, and [in] the mountains of the Medes.
012	2KI	017	007	For it came to pass that the children of Israel [had] transgressed against the Lord their God, who had brought them up out of the land of Egypt, from under the hand of Pharao king of Egypt, and they feared other gods,
012	2KI	017	008	and walked in the statutes of the nations which the Lord cast out before the face of the children of Israel, and of the kings of Israel as many as did [such things],
012	2KI	017	009	and [in those] of the children of Israel as many as secretly practised customs, not as [they should have done], against the Lord their God:
012	2KI	017	010	and they built for themselves high places in all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city. And they made for themselves pillars and groves on every high hill, and under every shady tree.
012	2KI	017	011	And burned incense there on all high places, as the nations [did] whom the Lord removed from before them, and dealt with familiar spirits, and they carved [images] to provoke the Lord to anger.
012	2KI	017	012	And they served the idols, of which the Lord said to them, Ye shall not do this thing [against] the Lord.
012	2KI	017	013	And the Lord testified against Israel and against Juda, even by the hand of all his prophets, [and] of every seer, saying, Turn ye from your evil ways, and keep my commandments and my ordinances, and all the law which I commanded your fathers, [and] all that I sent to them by the hand of my servants the prophets.
012	2KI	017	014	But they hearkened not, and made their neck harder than the neck of their fathers.
012	2KI	017	015	And they kept not any of his testimonies which he charged them; and they walked after vanities, and became vain, and after the nations round about them, concerning which the Lord had charged them not to do accordingly.
012	2KI	017	016	They forsook the commandments of the Lord their God, and made themselves graven images, [even] two heifers, and they made groves, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served Baal.
012	2KI	017	017	And they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire, and used divinations and auspices, and sold themselves to work wickedness in the sight of the Lord, to provoke him.
012	2KI	017	018	And the Lord was very angry with Israel, and removed them out of his sight; and there was only left the tribe of Juda quite alone.
012	2KI	017	019	Nay even Juda kept not the commandments of the Lord their God, but they walked according to the customs of Israel which they practised, and rejected the Lord.
012	2KI	017	020	And the Lord was angry with the whole seed of Israel, and troubled them, and gave them into the hand of them that spoiled them, until he cast them out of his presence.
012	2KI	017	021	Forasmuch as Israel revolted from the house of David, and they made Jeroboam the son of Nabat king: and Jeroboam drew off Israel from following the Lord, and led them to sin a great sin.
012	2KI	017	022	And the children of Israel walked in all the sin of Jeroboam which he committed; they departed not from it,
012	2KI	017	023	until the Lord removed Israel from his presence, as the Lord spoke by all his servants the prophets; and Israel was removed from off their land to the Assyrians until this day.
012	2KI	017	024	And the king of Assyria brought from Babylon the men of Chutha, [and men] from Aia, and from Aemath, and Seppharvaim, and they were settled in the cities of Samaria in the place of the children of Israel: and they inherited Samaria, and were settled in its cities.
012	2KI	017	025	And it was so at the beginning of their establishment there [that] they feared not the Lord, and the Lord sent lions among them, and they slew some of them.
012	2KI	017	026	And they spoke to the king of the Assyrians, saying, The nations whom thou hast removed and substituted in the cities of Samaria [for the Israelites], know not the manner of the God of the land: and he has sent the lions against them, and, behold, they are slaying them, because they know not the manner of the God of the land.
012	2KI	017	027	And the king of the Assyrians commanded, saying, Bring some [Israelites] thence, and let them go and dwell there, and they shall teach them the manner of the God of the land.
012	2KI	017	028	And they brought one of the priests whom they had removed from Samaria, and he settled in Baethel, and taught them how they should fear the Lord.
012	2KI	017	029	But the nations made each their own gods, and put them in the house of the high places which the Samaritans [had] made, each nation in the cities in which they dwelt.
012	2KI	017	030	And the men of Babylon made Socchoth Benith, and the men of Chuth made Ergel, and the men of Haemath made Asimath.
012	2KI	017	031	And the Evites made Eblazer and Tharthac, and the [inhabitant] of Seppharvaim [did evil] when they burnt their sons in the fire to Adramelech and Anemelech, the gods of Seppharvaim.
012	2KI	017	032	And they feared the Lord, yet they established their abominations in the houses of the high places which they made in Samaria, each nation in the city in which they dwelt: and they feared the Lord, and they made for themselves priests of the high places, and sacrificed for themselves in the house of the high places.
012	2KI	017	033	And they feared the Lord, and served their gods according to the manner of the nations, whence [their lords] brought them.
012	2KI	017	034	Until this day they did according to their manner: they fear [the Lord], and they do according to their customs, and according to their manner, and according to the law, and according to the commandment which the Lord commanded the sons of Jacob, whose name he made Israel.
012	2KI	017	035	And the Lord made a covenant with them, and charged them, saying, Ye shall not fear other gods, neither shall ye worship them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them:
012	2KI	017	036	but only to the Lord, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great strength and with a high arm: him shall ye fear, and him shall ye worship; to him shall ye sacrifice.
012	2KI	017	037	Ye shall observe continually the ordinances, and the judgments, and the law, and the commandments which he wrote for you to do; and ye shall not fear other gods.
012	2KI	017	038	Neither shall ye forget the covenant which he made with you: and ye shall not fear other gods.
012	2KI	017	039	But ye shall fear the Lord your God, and he shall deliver you from all your enemies.
012	2KI	017	040	Neither shall ye comply with their practice, which they follow.
012	2KI	017	041	So these nations feared the Lord, and served their graven images: yea, their sons and their son's sons do until this day even as their fathers did.
012	2KI	018	001	And it came to pass in the third year of Osee son of Ela king of Israel [that] Ezekias son of Achaz king of Juda began to reign.
012	2KI	018	002	Five and twenty years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name [was] Abu, daughter of Zacharias.
012	2KI	018	003	And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, according to all that his father David did.
012	2KI	018	004	He removed the high places, and broke in pieces the pillars, and utterly destroyed the groves, and the brazen serpent which Moses made: because until those days the children of Israel burnt incense to it: and he called it Neesthan.
012	2KI	018	005	He trusted in the Lord God of Israel; and after him there was not any like him among the kings of Juda, nor among those that were before him.
012	2KI	018	006	And he clave to the Lord, he departed not from following him; and he kept his commandments, as many as he commanded Moses.
012	2KI	018	007	And the Lord was with him; and he was wise in all that he undertook: and he revolted from the king of the Assyrians, and served him not.
012	2KI	018	008	He smote the Philistines [even] to Gaza, and to the border of it, from the tower of the watchmen even to the strong city.
012	2KI	018	009	And it came to pass in the fourth year of King Ezekias (this is the seventh year of Osee son of Ela king of Israel,) [that] Salamanassar king of the Assyrians came up against Samaria, and besieged it.
012	2KI	018	010	And he took it at the end of three years, in the sixth year of Ezekias, (this [is] the ninth year of Osee king of Israel, when Samaria was taken.)
012	2KI	018	011	And the king of the Assyrians carried away the Samaritans to Assyria, and put them in Alae and in Abor, [by] the river Gozan, and [in] the mountains of the Medes;
012	2KI	018	012	because they hearkened not to the voice of the Lord their God, and transgressed his covenant, [even] in all things that Moses the servant of the Lord commanded, and hearkened not [to them], nor did [them].
012	2KI	018	013	And in the fourteenth year of king Ezekias came up Sennacherim king of the Assyrians against the strong cities of Juda, and took them.
012	2KI	018	014	And Ezekias king of Juda sent messengers to the king of the Assyrians to Lachis, saying, I have offended; depart from me: whatsoever thou shalt lay upon me, I will bear. And the king of Assyria laid upon Ezekias king of Juda [a tribute of] three hundred talents of silver, and thirty talents of gold.
012	2KI	018	015	And Ezekias gave all the silver that was found in the house of the Lord, and in the treasures of the king's house.
012	2KI	018	016	At that time Ezekias cut off [the gold from] the doors of the temple, and [from] the pillars which Ezekias king of Juda [had] overlaid with gold, and gave it to the king of the Assyrians.
012	2KI	018	017	And the king of the Assyrians sent Tharthan and Raphis and Rapsakes from Lachis to king Ezekias with a strong force against Jerusalem. And they went up and came to Jerusalem, and stood by the aqueduct of the upper pool, which is by the way of the fuller's field.
012	2KI	018	018	And they cried to Ezekias: and there came to him Heliakim the son of Chelcias the steward, and Somnas the scribe, and Joas the son of Saphat the recorder.
012	2KI	018	019	And Rapsakes said to them, Say now to Ezekias, Thus says the king, the great king of the Assyrians, What [is] this confidence wherein thou trustest?
012	2KI	018	020	Thou hast said, (but [they are] mere words,) [I have] counsel and strength for war. Now then in whom dost thou trust, that thou hast revolted from me?
012	2KI	018	021	See now, art thou trusting for thyself on this broken staff of reed, [even] upon Egypt? whosoever shall stay himself upon it, it shall even go into his hand, and pierce it: so [is] Pharao king of Egypt to all that trust on him.
012	2KI	018	022	And whereas thou hast said to me, We trust on the Lord God: [is] not this he, whose high places and altars Ezekias has removed, and has said to Juda and Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem?
012	2KI	018	023	And now, I pray you, make and agreement with my lord the king of the Assyrians, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou shalt be able on thy part to set riders upon them.
012	2KI	018	024	How then wilt thou turn away the face of one petty governor, from among the least of my lord's servants? whereas thou trustest for thyself on Egypt for chariots and horsemen.
012	2KI	018	025	And now have we come up without the Lord against this place to destroy it? The Lord said to me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.
012	2KI	018	026	And Heliakim the son of Chelkias, and Somnas, and Joas, said to Rapsakes, Speak now to thy servants in the Syrian language, for we understand it; and speak not with us in the Jewish language: and why dost thou speak in the ears of the people that are on the wall?
012	2KI	018	027	And Rapsakes said to them, Has my master sent me to thy master, and to thee, to speak these words? [has he] not [sent me] to the men who sit on the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own water together with you.
012	2KI	018	028	And Rapsakes stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jewish language, and spoke, and said, Hear the words of the great king of the Assyrians:
012	2KI	018	029	thus says the king, Let not Ezekias encourage you with words: for he shall not be able to deliver you out of his hand.
012	2KI	018	030	And let not Ezekias cause you to trust on the Lord, saying, The Lord will certainly deliver us; this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of the Assyrians: hearken not to Ezekias:
012	2KI	018	031	for thus says the king of the Assyrians, Gain my favour, and come forth to me, and every man shall drink [of the wine] of his own vine, and every man shall eat of his own fig-tree, and shall drink water out of his own cistern;
012	2KI	018	032	until I come and remove you to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, and bread and vineyards, a land of olive oil, and honey, and ye shall live and not die: and do not ye hearken to Ezekias, for he deceives you, saying, The Lord shall deliver you.
012	2KI	018	033	Have the Gods of the nations at all delivered each their own land out of the hand of the king of the Assyrians?
012	2KI	018	034	Where is the god of Haemath, and of Arphad? where is the god of Seppharvaim, Ana, and Aba? for have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?
012	2KI	018	035	Who [is there] among all the gods of the countries, who have delivered their countries out of my hand, that the Lord should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?
012	2KI	018	036	But [the men] were silent, and answered him not a word: for [there was] a commandment of the king, saying, Ye shall not answer him.
012	2KI	018	037	And Heliakim the son of Chelcias, the steward, and Somnas the scribe, and Joas the son of Saphat the recorder came in to Ezekias, having rent their garments; and they reported to him the words of Rapsakes.
012	2KI	019	001	And it came to pass when king Ezekias heard it, that he rent his clothes, and put on sackcloth, an went into the house of the Lord.
012	2KI	019	002	And he sent Heliakim the steward, and Somnas the scribe, and the elders of the priests, clothed with sackcloth, to Esaias the prophet the son of Amos.
012	2KI	019	003	And they said to him, Thus says Ezekias, This day [is] a day of tribulation, and rebuke, and provocation: for the children are come to the travail-[pangs], but the mother has no strength.
012	2KI	019	004	Peradventure the Lord thy God will hear all the words of Rapsakes, whom the king of Assyria his master has sent to reproach the living God and to revile him with the words which the Lord thy God has heard: and thou shalt offer [thy] prayer for the remnant that is found.
012	2KI	019	005	So the servants of king Ezekias came to Esaias.
012	2KI	019	006	And Esaias said to them, Thus shall ye say to your master, Thus saith the Lord, Be not afraid of the words which thou hast heard, wherewith the servants of the king of the Assyrians have blasphemed.
012	2KI	019	007	Behold, I send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a report, and shall return to his own land; and I will overthrow him with the sword in his own land.
012	2KI	019	008	So Rapsakes returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Lobna: for he heard that he [had] departed from Lachis.
012	2KI	019	009	And he heard concerning Tharaca king of the Ethiopians, saying, Behold, he is come forth to fight with thee: and he returned, and sent messengers to Ezekias, saying,
012	2KI	019	010	Let not thy God on whom thou trustest encourage thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hands of the king of the Assyrians.
012	2KI	019	011	Behold, thou hast heard all that the kings of the Assyrians have done in all the lands, to waste them utterly: and shalt thou be delivered?
012	2KI	019	012	Have the gods of the nations at all delivered them, whom my fathers destroyed; both Gozan, and Charran, and Raphis, and the sons of Edem who were in Thaesthen?
012	2KI	019	013	Where is the king of Haemath, and the king of Arphad? and where is the king of the city of Seppharvaim, of Ana, and Aba?
012	2KI	019	014	And Ezekias took the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it: and he went up to the house of the Lord, and Ezekias spread it before the Lord,
012	2KI	019	015	and said, O Lord God of Israel that dwellest over the cherubs, thou art the only god in all the kingdoms of the earth; thou hast made heaven and earth.
012	2KI	019	016	Incline thine ear, O Lord, and hear: open, Lord, thine eyes, and see: and hear the words of Sennacherim, which he has sent to reproach the living God.
012	2KI	019	017	For truly, Lord, the kings of Assyria have wasted the nations,
012	2KI	019	018	and have cast their gods into the fire: because they are no gods, but the works of men's hands, wood and stone; and they have destroyed them.
012	2KI	019	019	And now, O Lord our God, deliver us out of his hand, and all the kingdoms of the earth shall know that thou alone [art] the Lord God.
012	2KI	019	020	And Esaias the son of Amos sent to Ezekias, saying, Thus saith the Lord God of hosts, the God of Israel, I have heard thy prayer to me concerning Sennacherim king of the Assyrians.
012	2KI	019	021	This [is] the word which the Lord has spoken against him; The virgin daughter of Sion has made light of thee, and mocked thee; the daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head at thee.
012	2KI	019	022	Whom hast thou reproached, and whom hast thou reviled? and against whom hast thou lifted up thy voice, and raised thine eyes on high? [Is it] against the Holy One of Israel?
012	2KI	019	023	By thy messengers thou has reproached the Lord, and hast said, I will go up with the multitude of my chariots, to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Libanus, and I have cut down the height of his cedar, [and] his choice cypresses; and I have come into the midst of the forest and of Carmel.
012	2KI	019	024	I have refreshed [myself], and have drunk strange waters, and I have dried up with the sole of my foot all the rivers of fortified places.
012	2KI	019	025	I have brought about [the matter], I have brought it to a conclusion; and it is come to the destruction of the bands of warlike prisoners, [even of] strong cities.
012	2KI	019	026	And they that dwelt in them were weak in hand, they quaked and were confounded, they became [as] grass of the field, or [as] the green herb, the grass [growing on] houses, and that which is trodden down by him that stands [upon it].
012	2KI	019	027	But I know thy down-sitting, and thy going forth, and thy rage against me.
012	2KI	019	028	Because thou was angry against me, and thy fierceness is come up into my ears, therefore will I put my hooks in thy nostrils, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.
012	2KI	019	029	And this shall be a sign to thee; eat this year the things that grow of themselves, and in the second year the things which spring up: and in the third year [let there be] sowing, and reaping, and planting of vineyards, and eat ye the fruit of them.
012	2KI	019	030	And he shall increase him that has escaped of the house of Juda: and the remnant [shall strike] root beneath, and it shall produce fruit above.
012	2KI	019	031	For from Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and he that escapes from the mountain of Sion: the zeal of the Lord of host shall do this.
012	2KI	019	032	[Is it] not so? Thus saith the Lord concerning the king of the Assyrians, He shall not enter into this city, and he shall not shoot an arrow there, neither shall a shield come against it, neither shall he heap a mound against it.
012	2KI	019	033	By the way by which he comes, by it shall he return, and he shall not enter into this city, saith the Lord.
012	2KI	019	034	And I will defend this city as with a shield, for my own sake, and for my servant David's sake.
012	2KI	019	035	And it came to pass at night that the angel of the Lord went forth, an smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and eighty-five thousand: and they rose early in the morning, and, behold, [these were] all dead corpses.
012	2KI	019	036	And Sennacherim king of the Assyrians departed, and went and returned, and dwelt in Nineve.
012	2KI	019	037	And it came to pass, while he was worshipping in the house of Meserach his god, that Adramelech and Sarasar his sons smote him with the sword: and they escaped into the land of Ararath; and Asordan his son reigned in his stead.
012	2KI	020	001	In those days was Ezekias sick [even] to death. And the prophet Esaias the son of Amos came in to him, and said to him, Thus saith the Lord, Give charge to thy household; [for] thou shalt die, and not live.
012	2KI	020	002	And Ezekias turned to the wall, and prayed to the Lord, saying,
012	2KI	020	003	Lord, remember, I pray thee, how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thine eyes. And Ezekias wept with a great weeping.
012	2KI	020	004	And Esaias was in the middle court, and the word of the Lord came to him, saying,
012	2KI	020	005	Turn back, and thou shalt say to Ezekias the ruler of my people, Thus saith the Lord God of thy father David, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will heal thee: on the third day thou shalt go up to the house of the Lord.
012	2KI	020	006	And I will add to thy days fifteen years; and I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of the Assyrians, and I will defend this city for my own sake, and for my servant's David sake.
012	2KI	020	007	And he said, Let them take a cake of figs, and lay it upon the ulcer, and he shall be well.
012	2KI	020	008	And Ezekias said to Esaias, What [is] the sign that the Lord will heal me, and I shall go up to the house of the Lord on the third day?
012	2KI	020	009	And Esaias said, This [is] the sign from the Lord, that the Lord will perform the word which he has spoken, the shadow [of the dial] shall advance ten degrees: [or] if it should go back ten degrees [this would also be the sign].
012	2KI	020	010	And Ezekias said, [It is] a light thing for the shadow to go down ten degrees: nay, but let the shadow return ten degrees backward on the dial.
012	2KI	020	011	And Esaias the prophet cried to the Lord: and the shadow returned back ten degrees on the dial.
012	2KI	020	012	At that time Marodach Baladan, son of Baladan king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Ezekias, because he had heard that Ezekias was sick.
012	2KI	020	013	And Ezekias rejoiced at them, and shewed all the house of his spices, the silver and the gold, the spices, and the fine oil, and the armory, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing which Ezekias did not shew them in his house, and in all his dominion.
012	2KI	020	014	And Esaias the prophet went in to king Ezekias, and said to him, What said these men? and whence came they to thee? And Ezekias said, they came to me from a distant land, [even] from Babylon.
012	2KI	020	015	And he said, What saw they in thy house? And he said, They saw all things that [are] in my house: there was nothing in my house which I shewed not to them; yea, all that was in my treasures also.
012	2KI	020	016	And Esaias said to Ezekias, Hear the word of the Lord:
012	2KI	020	017	Behold, the days come, that all things that are in thy house shall be taken, and all that thy fathers have treasured up until this day, to Babylon; and there shall not fail a word, which the Lord has spoken.
012	2KI	020	018	And as for thy sons which shall come forth of thee, which thou shalt beget, [the enemy] shall take them, and they shall be eunuchs in the house of the king of Babylon.
012	2KI	020	019	And Ezekias said to Esaias, Good [is] the word of the Lord which he has spoken: [only] let there be peace in my days.
012	2KI	020	020	And the rest of the acts of Ezekias, and all his might, and all that he made, the fountain and the aqueduct, and [how] he brought water into the city, [are] not these things written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Juda?
012	2KI	020	021	And Ezekias slept with his fathers: and Manasses his son reigned in his stead.
012	2KI	021	001	Manasses [was] twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name [was] Apsiba.
012	2KI	021	002	And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the Lord, according to the abominations of the nations which the Lord cast out from before the children of Israel.
012	2KI	021	003	And he built again the high places, which Ezekias his father [had] demolished; and set up an altar to Baal, and made groves as Achaab king of Israel [made them]; and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them.
012	2KI	021	004	And he built an altar in the house of the Lord, whereas he had said, In Jerusalem I will place my name.
012	2KI	021	005	And he built an altar to all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the Lord.
012	2KI	021	006	And he caused his sons to pass through the fire, and used divination and auspices, and made groves, and multiplied wizards, so as to do that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, to provoke him to anger.
012	2KI	021	007	And he set up the graven image of the grove in the house of which the Lord said to David, and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, will I even place my name for ever.
012	2KI	021	008	And I will not again remove the foot of Israel from the land which I gave to their fathers, [even of those] who shall keep all that I commanded, according to all the commandments which my servant Moses commanded them.
012	2KI	021	009	But they hearkened not; and Manasses led them astray to do evil in the sight of the Lord, beyond the nations whom the Lord utterly destroyed from before the children of Israel.
012	2KI	021	010	And the Lord spoke by his servants the prophets, saying,
012	2KI	021	011	Forasmuch as Manasses the king of Juda has wrought all these evil abominations, beyond all that the Amorite did, who lived before [him], and has led Juda also into sin by their idols,
012	2KI	021	012	[it shall] not [be] so. Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Behold, I bring calamities upon Jerusalem and Juda, so that both the ears of every one that hears shall tingle.
012	2KI	021	013	And I will stretch out over Jerusalem the measure of Samaria, and the plummet of the house of Achaab: and I will wipe Jerusalem as a jar is wiped, and turned upside down in the wiping.
012	2KI	021	014	And I will reject the remnant of my inheritance, and will deliver them into the hands of their enemies; and they shall be for a plunder and for a spoil to all their enemies:
012	2KI	021	015	forasmuch as they have done wickedly in my sight, and have provoked me from the day that I brought out their fathers out of Egypt, even until this day.
012	2KI	021	016	Moreover Manasses shed very much innocent blood, until he filled Jerusalem [with it] from one end to the other, beside his sins with which he caused Juda to sin, in doing evil in the eyes of the Lord.
012	2KI	021	017	And the rest of the acts of Manasses, and all that he did, and his sin which he sinned, [are] not these things written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Juda?
012	2KI	021	018	And Manasses slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his house, [even] in the garden of Oza: and Amos his son reigned in his stead.
012	2KI	021	019	Twenty and two years old [was] Amos when he began to reign, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name [was] Mesollam, daughter of Arus of Jeteba.
012	2KI	021	020	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, as Manasses his father did.
012	2KI	021	021	And he walked in all the way in which his father walked, and served the idols which his father served, and worshipped them.
012	2KI	021	022	And he forsook the Lord God of his fathers, and walked not in the way of the Lord.
012	2KI	021	023	And the servants of Amos conspired against him, and slew the king in his house.
012	2KI	021	024	And the people of the land slew all that had conspired against king Amos; and the people of the land made Josias king in his room.
012	2KI	021	025	And the rest of the acts of Amos, [even] all that he did, behold, [are] not these written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Juda?
012	2KI	021	026	And they buried him in his tomb in the garden of Oza: and Josias his son reigned in his stead.
012	2KI	022	001	Josias [was] eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned thirty and one years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name [was] Jedia, daughter of Edeia of Basuroth.
012	2KI	022	002	And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, and walked in all the way of David his father; he turned not aside to the right hand or to the left.
012	2KI	022	003	And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josias, in the eighth month, the king sent Sapphan the son of Ezelias the son of Mesollam, the scribe of the house of the Lord, saying,
012	2KI	022	004	Go up to Chelcias the high priest, and take account of the money that is brought into the house of the Lord, which they that keep the door have collected of the people.
012	2KI	022	005	And let them give it into the hand of the workmen that are appointed in the house of the Lord. And he gave it to the workmen in the house of the Lord, to repair the breaches of the house,
012	2KI	022	006	[even] to the carpenters, and builders, and masons, [and] also to purchase timber and hewn stones, to repair the breaches of the house.
012	2KI	022	007	Only they did not call them to account for the money that was given to them, because they dealt faithfully.
012	2KI	022	008	And Chelcias the high priest said to Saphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the Lord. And Chelcias gave the book to Sapphan, and he read it.
012	2KI	022	009	And he went into the house of the Lord to the king, and reported the matter to the king, and said, Thy servants have collected the money that was found in the house of the Lord, and have given it into the hand of the workmen that are appointed in the house of the Lord.
012	2KI	022	010	And Sapphan the scribe spoke to the king, saying, Chelcias the priest has given me a book. And Sapphan read it before the king.
012	2KI	022	011	And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the book of the law, that he rent his garments.
012	2KI	022	012	And the king commanded Chelcias the priest, and Achikam the son of Sapphan, and Achobor the son of Michaias, and Sapphan the scribe, and Asaias the king's servant, saying,
012	2KI	022	013	Go, enquire of the Lord for me, and for all the people, and for all Juda, and concerning the words of this book that has been found: for the wrath of the Lord that has been kindled against us [is] great, because our fathers hearkened not to the words of this book, to do according to all the things written concerning us.
012	2KI	022	014	So Chelcias the priest went, and Achicam, and Achobor, and Sapphan, and Asaias, to Olda the prophetess, the mother of Sellem the son of Thecuan son of Aras, keeper of the robes; and she dwelt in Jerusalem in Masena; and they spoke to her.
012	2KI	022	015	And she said to them, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Say to the man that sent you to me,
012	2KI	022	016	Thus saith the Lord, Behold, I bring evil upon this place, and upon them that dwell in it, [even] all the words of the book which the king of Juda has read:
012	2KI	022	017	because they have forsaken me, and burnt incense to other gods, that they might provoke me with the works of their hands: therefore my wrath shall burn forth against this place, and shall not be quenched.
012	2KI	022	018	And to the king of Juda that sent you to enquire of the Lord, —thus shall ye say to him, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, [As for] the words which thou hast heard;
012	2KI	022	019	because thy heart was softened, and thou was humbled before [me], when thou heardest all that I spoke against this place, and against the inhabitants of it, that it should be utterly destroyed and accursed, and thou didst rend thy garments, and weep before me; I also have heard, saith the Lord.
012	2KI	022	020	It shall not be so [therefore]: behold, I [will] add thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy tomb in peace, and thine eyes shall not see [any] among all the evils which I bring upon this place.
012	2KI	023	001	So they reported the word to the king: and the king sent and gathered all the elders of Juda and Jerusalem to himself.
012	2KI	023	002	And the king went up to the house of the Lord, and every man of Juda and all who dwelt in Jerusalem with him, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the people small and great; and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of the Lord.
012	2KI	023	003	And the king stood by a pillar, and made a covenant before the Lord, to walk after the Lord, to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his ordinances with all the heart and with all the soul, to confirm the words of this covenant; [even] the things written in this book. And all the people stood to the covenant.
012	2KI	023	004	And the king commanded Chelcias the high priest, and the priests of the second order, and them that kept the door, to bring out of the temple of the Lord all the vessels that were made for Baal, and for the grove, and all the host of heaven, and he burned them without Jerusalem in the fields of Kedron, and took the ashes of them to Baethel.
012	2KI	023	005	And he burned the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Juda [had] appointed, (and they burned incense in the high places and in the cities of Juda, and the places around about Jerusalem); and them that burned incense to Baal, and to the sun, and to the moon, and to Mazuroth, and to all the host of heaven.
012	2KI	023	006	And he carried out the grove from the house of the Lord to the brook Kedron, and burned it at the brook Kedron, and reduced it to powder, and cast its powder on the sepulchres of the sons of the people.
012	2KI	023	007	And he pulled down the house of the sodomites that were by the house of the Lord, where the women wove tents for the grove.
012	2KI	023	008	And he brought up all the priest from the cities of Juda, and defiled the high places where the priests burned incense, from Gaebal even to Bersabee; and he pulled down the house of the gates that was by the door of the gate of Joshua the ruler of the city, on a man's left hand at the gate of the city.
012	2KI	023	009	Only the priests of the high places went not up to the altar of the Lord in Jerusalem, for they only ate leavened bread in the midst of their brethren.
012	2KI	023	010	And he defiled Tapheth which is in the valley of the son of Ennom, [constructed] for a man to cause his son or his daughter to pass through fire to Moloch.
012	2KI	023	011	And he burned the horses which the king of Juda had given to the sun in the entrance of the house of the Lord, by the treasury of Nathan the king's eunuch, in the suburbs; and he burned the chariot of the sun with fire.
012	2KI	023	012	And the altars that were on the roof of the upper chamber of Achaz, which the kings of Juda had made, and the altars which Manasses had made in the two courts of the house of the Lord, did the king pull down and forcibly remove from thence, and cast their dust into the brook of Kedron.
012	2KI	023	013	And the king defiled the house that was before Jerusalem, on the right hand of the mount of Mosthath, which Solomon king of Israel built to Astarte the abomination of the Sidonians, and to Chamos the abomination of Moab, and to Moloch the abomination of the children of Ammon.
012	2KI	023	014	And he broke in pieces the pillars, and utterly destroyed the groves, and filled their places with the bones of men.
012	2KI	023	015	Also the high altar in Baethel, which Jeroboam the son of Nabat, who made Israel to sin, had made, even that high altar he tore down, and broke in pieces the stones of it, and reduced it to powder, and burnt the grove.
012	2KI	023	016	And Josias turned aside, and saw the tombs that were there in the city, and sent, and took the bones out of the tombs, and burnt them on the altar, and defiled it, according to the word of the Lord which the man of God spoke, when Jeroboam stood by the altar at the feast: and he turned and raised his eyes to the tomb of the man of God that spoke these words.
012	2KI	023	017	And he said, What [is] that mound which I see? And the men of the city said to him, [It is the grave of] the man of God that came out of Juda, and uttered these imprecations which he imprecated upon the altar of Baethel.
012	2KI	023	018	And he said, Let him alone; let no one disturb his bones. So his bones were spared, together with the bones of the prophet that came out of Samaria.
012	2KI	023	019	Moreover Josias removed all the houses of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel made to provoke the Lord, and did to them all that he did in Baethel.
012	2KI	023	020	And he sacrificed all the priests of the high places that were there on the altars, and burnt the bones of men upon them, and returned to Jerusalem.
012	2KI	023	021	And the king commanded all the people, saying, Keep the passover to the Lord your God, as it is written in the book of this covenant.
012	2KI	023	022	For a passover [such as] this had not been kept from the days of the judges who judged Israel, even all the days of the kings of Israel, and of the kings of Juda.
012	2KI	023	023	But in the eighteenth year of king Josias, was the passover kept to the Lord in Jerusalem.
012	2KI	023	024	Moreover Josias removed the sorcerers, and the wizards, and the theraphin, and the idols, and all the abominations that had been set up in the land of Juda and in Jerusalem, that he might keep the words of the law that were written in the book, which Chelcias the priest found in the house of the Lord.
012	2KI	023	025	There was no king like him before him, who turned to the Lord with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his strength, according to all the law of Moses; and after him there rose not one like him.
012	2KI	023	026	Nevertheless the Lord turned not from the fierceness of his great anger, wherewith he was wroth in his anger against Juda, because of the provocations, wherewith Manasses provoked him.
012	2KI	023	027	And the Lord said, I will also remove Juda from my presence, as I removed Israel, and will reject this city which I have chosen [even] Jerusalem, and the house [of] which I said, My name shall be there.
012	2KI	023	028	And the rest of the acts of Josias, and all that he did, [are] not these things written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Juda?
012	2KI	023	029	And in his days went up Pharao Nechao king of Egypt against the king of the Assyrians to the river Euphrates: and Josias went out to meet him: and Nechao slew him in Mageddo when he saw him.
012	2KI	023	030	And his servants carried him dead from Mageddo, and brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his sepulchre: and the people of the land took Joachaz the son of Josias, and anointed him, and made him king in the room of his father.
012	2KI	023	031	Twenty and three years old was Joachaz when he began to reign, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem: and his mother's name [was] Amital, daughter of Jeremias of Lobna.
012	2KI	023	032	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, according to all that his fathers did.
012	2KI	023	033	And Pharao Nechao removed him to Rablaam in the land of Emath, so that he should not reign in Jerusalem; and imposed a tribute on the land, a hundred talents of silver, and a hundred talents of gold.
012	2KI	023	034	And Pharao Nechao made Eliakim son of Josias king of Juda king over them in the place of his father Josias, and he changed his name [to] Joakim, and he took Joachaz and brought him to Egypt, and he died there.
012	2KI	023	035	And Joakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharao; but he assessed the land to give the money at the command of Pharao: they gave the silver and the gold [each] man according to his assessment together with the people of the land to give to Pharao Nechao.
012	2KI	023	036	Twenty-five years old [was] Joakim when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name [was] Jeldaph, daughter of Phadail of Ruma.
012	2KI	023	037	And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the lord, according to all that his fathers had done.
012	2KI	024	001	In his days went up Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, and Joakim became his servant three years; and [then] he turned and revolted from him.
012	2KI	024	002	And the lord sent against him the bands of the Chaldeans, and the bands of Syria, and the bans of Moab, and the bands of the children of Ammon, and sent them into the land of Juda to prevail [against it], according to the word of the Lord, which he spoke by his servants the prophets.
012	2KI	024	003	Moreover it was the purpose of the Lord concerning Juda, to remove them from his presence, because of the sins of Manasses, according to all that he did.
012	2KI	024	004	Moreover he shed innocent blood, and filled Jerusalem with innocent blood, and the Lord would not pardon [it].
012	2KI	024	005	And the rest of the acts of Joakim, and all that he did, behold, [are] not these written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Juda?
012	2KI	024	006	And Joakim slept with his fathers: and Joachim his son reigned in his stead.
012	2KI	024	007	And the king of Egypt came no more out of his land: for the king of Babylon took away all that belonged to the king of Egypt from the river of Egypt as far as the river Euphrates.
012	2KI	024	008	Eighteen years old [was] Joachim when he began to reign, an he reigned three months in Jerusalem: and his mother's name [was] Nestha, daughter of Ellanastham, of Jerusalem.
012	2KI	024	009	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, according to all that his father did.
012	2KI	024	010	At that time went up Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon to Jerusalem, and the city was besieged.
012	2KI	024	011	And Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon came against the city, and his servants besieged it.
012	2KI	024	012	And Joachim king of Juda came forth to the king of Babylon, he and his servants, and his mother, and his princes, and his eunuchs; and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign.
012	2KI	024	013	And he brought forth thence all the treasures of the house of the Lord, and the treasures of the king's house, and he cut up all the golden vessels which Solomon the king of Israel [had] made in the temple of the Lord, according to the word of the Lord.
012	2KI	024	014	And he carried away [the inhabitants of] Jerusalem, and all the captains, and the mighty men, taking captive ten thousand prisoners, and every artificer and smith: and only the poor of the land were left.
012	2KI	024	015	And he carried Joachim away to Babylon, and the king's mother, and the king's wives, and his eunuchs: and he carried away the mighty men of the land into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon.
012	2KI	024	016	And all the men of might, even seven thousand, and one thousand artificers and smiths: all [were] mighty [men] fit for war; and the king of Babylon carried them captive to Babylon.
012	2KI	024	017	And the king of Babylon made Batthanias his son king in his stead, and called his name Sedekias.
012	2KI	024	018	Twenty and one years old [was] Sedekias when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name [was] Amital daughter of Jeremias.
012	2KI	024	019	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, according to all that Joachim did.
012	2KI	024	020	For it was according to the Lord's anger against Jerusalem and on Juda, until he cast them out of his presence, that Sedekias revolted against the king of Babylon.
012	2KI	025	001	And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, [that] Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon came, and all his host, against Jerusalem; and he encamped against it, and built a mound against it.
012	2KI	025	002	And the city was besieged until the eleventh year of king Sedekias on the ninth day of the month.
012	2KI	025	003	And the famine prevailed in the city, and there was no bread for the people of the land.
012	2KI	025	004	And the city was broken up, and all the men of war went forth by night, by the way of the gate between the walls, this is [the gate] of the king's garden: and the Chaldeans [were set] against the city round about: and [the king] went by the way of the plain.
012	2KI	025	005	And the force of the Chaldeans pursued the king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho: and all his army was dispersed from about him.
012	2KI	025	006	And they took the king, and brought him to the king of Babylon to Reblatha; and he gave judgment upon him.
012	2KI	025	007	And he slew the sons of Sedekias before his eyes, and put out the eyes of Sedekias, and bound him in fetters, and brought him to Babylon.
012	2KI	025	008	And in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month (this [is] the nineteenth year of Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon), came Nabuzardan, captain of the guard, who stood before the king of Babylon, to Jerusalem.
012	2KI	025	009	And he burnt the house of the Lord, and the king's house, and all the houses of Jerusalem, even every house did the captain of the guard burn.
012	2KI	025	010	And the force of the Chaldeans pulled down the wall of Jerusalem round about.
012	2KI	025	011	And Nabuzardan the captain of the guard removed the rest of the people that were left in the city, and the men who had deserted to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the multitude.
012	2KI	025	012	But the captain of the guard left of the poor of the land to be vine-dressers and husbandmen.
012	2KI	025	013	And the Chaldeans broke to pieces the brazen pillars that were in the house of the Lord, and the bases, and the brazen sea that was in the house of the Lord, and carried their brass to Babylon.
012	2KI	025	014	And the caldrons, and the shovels, and the bowls, and the censers, and all the brazen vessels with which they minister, he took.
012	2KI	025	015	And the captain of the guard took the fire-pans, and the gold and silver bowls.
012	2KI	025	016	Two pillars, and one sea, and the bases which Solomon made for the house of the Lord: there was no weight of the brass of all the vessels.
012	2KI	025	017	The height of one pillar [was] eighteen cubits, and the chapiter upon it was of brass: and the height of the chapiter was three cubits: the border, and the pomegranates on the chapiter round about were all of brass: and so it was with the second pillar with its border.
012	2KI	025	018	And the captain of the guard took Saraias the high-priest, and Sophonias the second in order, and the three doorkeepers.
012	2KI	025	019	And they took out of the city one eunuch who was commander of the men of war, and five men that saw the face of the king, that were found in the city, and the secretary of the commander-in-chief, who took account of the people of the land, and sixty men of the people of the land that were found in the city.
012	2KI	025	020	And Nabuzardan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Reblatha.
012	2KI	025	021	And the king of Babylon smote them and slew them at Reblatha in the land of Aemath. So Juda was carried away from his land.
012	2KI	025	022	And [as for] the people that were left in the land of Juda, whom Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon left, even over them he set Godolias son of Achicam son of Saphan.

013	1CH	010	002	And the Philistines pursued after Saul, and after his sons; and the Philistines smote Jonathan, and Aminadab, and Melchisue, sons of Saul.
013	1CH	010	003	And the battle prevailed against Saul, and the archers hit him with bows and arrows, and they were wounded of the bows.
013	1CH	010	004	And Saul said to his armour-bearer, Draw thy sword, and pierce me through with it, lest these uncircumcised come and mock me. But his armour-bearer would not, for he was greatly afraid: so Saul took a sword, and fell upon it.
013	1CH	010	005	And his armour-bearer saw that Saul was dead, and he also fell upon his sword.
013	1CH	010	006	So Saul died, and his three sons on that day, and all his family died at the same time.

013	1CH	010	008	And it came to pass on the next [day] that the Philistines came to strip the slain, and they found Saul and his sons fallen on mount Gelbue.
013	1CH	010	009	And they stripped him, and took his head, and his armour, and sent them into the land of the Philistines round about, to proclaim the glad tidings to their idols, and to the people.
013	1CH	010	010	And they put their armour in the house of their god, and they put his head in the house of Dagon.
013	1CH	010	011	And all the dwellers in Galaad heard of all that the Philistines had done to Saul and to Israel.
013	1CH	010	012	And all the mighty men rose up from Galaad, and they took the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabis, and buried their bones under the oak in Jabis, and fasted seven days.
013	1CH	010	013	So Saul died for his transgressions, wherein he transgressed against God, against the word of the Lord, forasmuch as he kept [it] not, because Saul enquired of a wizard to seek [counsel], and Samuel the prophet answered him:
013	1CH	010	014	and he sought not the Lord: so he slew him, and turned the kingdom to David the son of Jesse.
013	1CH	011	001	And all Israel came to David in Chebron, saying, Behold, we [are] thy bones and thy flesh.
013	1CH	011	002	And heretofore when Saul was king, thou wast he that led Israel in and out, and the Lord of Israel said to thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be for a ruler over Israel.
013	1CH	011	003	And all the elders of Israel came to the king to Chebron; and king David made a covenant with them in Chebron before the Lord: and they anointed David to be king over Israel, according to the word of the Lord by Samuel.
013	1CH	011	004	And the king and his men went to Jerusalem, this [is] Jebus; and there the Jebusites the inhabitants of the land said to David,
013	1CH	011	005	Thou shalt not enter in hither. But he took the strong hold of Sion: this [is] the city of David.
013	1CH	011	006	And David said, Whoever first smites the Jebusite, even he shall be chief and captain. And Joab the son of Saruia went up first, and became chief.
013	1CH	011	007	And David dwelt in the strong hold; therefore he called it the city of David.
013	1CH	011	008	And he fortified the city round about.
013	1CH	011	009	And David continued to increase, and the Lord Almighty [was] with him.
013	1CH	011	010	And these [are] the chiefs of the mighty men, whom David had, who strengthened [themselves] with him in his kingdom, with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the Lord concerning Israel.
013	1CH	011	011	And this [is] the list of the mighty [men] of David; Jesebada, son of Achaman, first of the thirty: he drew his sword once against three hundred whom he slew at one time.
013	1CH	011	012	And after him Eleazar son of Dodai, the Achochite: he was among the three mighty men.
013	1CH	011	013	He was with David in Phasodamin, and the Philistines were gathered there to battle, and [there was] a portion of the field full of barley; and the people fled before the Philistines.
013	1CH	011	014	And he stood in the midst of the portion, and rescued it, and smote the Philistines; and the Lord wrought a great deliverance.
013	1CH	011	015	And three of the thirty chiefs went down to the rock to David, to the cave of Odollam, and the camp of the Philistines [was] in the giants' valley.
013	1CH	011	016	And David [was] then in the hold, and the garrison of the Philistines [was] then in Bethleem.
013	1CH	011	017	And David longed, and said, Who will give me water to drink of the well of Bethleem, that is in the gate?
013	1CH	011	018	And the three broke through the camp of the Philistines, and they drew water out of the well that was in Bethleem, which was in the gate, and they took it, and came to David: but David would not drink it, and poured it out to the Lord, and said,
013	1CH	011	019	God forbid that I should do this thing: shall I drink the blood of these men with their lives? for with [the peril of] their lives they brought it. So he would not drink it. These things did the three mighty [men].
013	1CH	011	020	And Abisa the brother of Joab, he was chief of three: he drew his sword against three hundred slain at one time, and he had a name among the [second] three.
013	1CH	011	021	He was more famous than the two [others] of the three, and he was chief [over] them; yet he reached not to the [first] three.
013	1CH	011	022	And Banaia the son of Jodae was the son of a mighty man: many [were] his acts for Cabasael: he smote two lion-like men of Moab, and he went down and smote a lion in a pit on a snowy day.
013	1CH	011	023	And he smote an Egyptian, a wonderful man five cubits [high]; and in the hand of the Egyptian [there was] a spear like a weavers' beam; and Banaia went down to him with a staff, and took the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear.
013	1CH	011	024	These things did Banaia son of Jodae, and his name [was] among the three mighties.
013	1CH	011	025	He was distinguished beyond the thirty, yet he reached not to the [first] three: and David set him over his family.
013	1CH	011	026	And the mighty [men] of the forces [were], Asael the brother of Joab, Eleanan the son of Dodoe of Bethleem,

013	1CH	012	001	And these [are] they that came to Sikelag, when he yet kept himself close because of Saul the son of Kis; and these [were] among the mighty, aiding [him] in war,
013	1CH	012	002	and [using] the bow with the right hand and with the left, and slingers with stones, and [shooters] with bows. Of the brethren of Saul of Benjamin,
013	1CH	012	003	the chief [was] Achiezer, and Joas son of Asma the Gabathite, and Joel and Jophalet, sons of Asmoth, and Berchia, and Jeul of Anathoth,

013	1CH	012	007	and Jelia and Zabadia, sons of Iroam, and the [men] of Gedor.
013	1CH	012	008	And from Gad these separated themselves to David from the wilderness, strong mighty men of war, bearing shields and spears, and their faces [were as] the face of a lion, and they were nimble as roes upon the mountains in speed.
013	1CH	012	009	Aza the chief, Abdia the second, Eliab the third,
013	1CH	012	010	Masmana the fourth, Jeremias the fifth,

013	1CH	012	013	Jeremia the tenth, Melchabanai the eleventh.
013	1CH	012	014	These [were] chiefs of the army of the sons of Gad, the least one commander of a hundred, and the greatest one of a thousand.
013	1CH	012	015	These [are] the [men] that crossed over Jordan in the first month, and it had overflowed all its banks; and they drove out all the inhabitants of the valleys, from the east to the west.
013	1CH	012	016	And there came [some] of the sons of Benjamin and Juda to the assistance of David.
013	1CH	012	017	And David went out to meet them, and said to them, If ye are come peaceably to me, let my heart be at peace with you: but if [ye are come] to betray me to my enemies unfaithfully, the God of your fathers look upon it, and reprove it.
013	1CH	012	018	And the Spirit came upon Amasai, a captain of the thirty, and he said, Go, David, son of Jesse, thou and thy people, peace, peace be to thee, and peace to thy helpers, for thy God has helped thee. And David received them, and made them captains of the forces.
013	1CH	012	019	And [some] came to David from Manasse, when the Philistines came against Saul to war: and he helped them not, because the captains of the Philistines took counsel, saying, With the heads of those men will he return to his master Saul.
013	1CH	012	020	When David was going to Sikelag, there came to him of Manasse, Edna and Jozabath, and Rodiel, and Michael, and Josabaith, and Elimuth, and Semathi: [these] are the captains of thousands of Manasse.
013	1CH	012	021	And they fought on the side of David against a troop, for they [were] all men of might; and they were commanders in the army, [because] of [their] might.
013	1CH	012	022	For daily men came to David, [till they amounted] to a great force, as the force of God.
013	1CH	012	023	And these [are] the names of the commanders of the army, who came to David to Chebron, to turn the kingdom of Saul to him according to the word of the Lord.

013	1CH	012	029	And of the sons of Benjamin, the brethren of Saul, three thousand: and still the greater part of them kept the guard of the house of Saul.
013	1CH	012	030	And of the sons of Ephraim, twenty thousand and eight hundred mighty men, famous in the houses of their fathers.
013	1CH	012	031	And of the half-tribe of Manasse, eighteen thousand, even [those] who were named by name, to make David king.
013	1CH	012	032	And of the sons of Issachar having wisdom with regard to the times, knowing what Israel should do, two hundred; and all their brethren with them.
013	1CH	012	033	And of Zabulon they that went out to battle, with all weapons of war, [were] fifty thousand to help David, not weak-handed.
013	1CH	012	034	And of Nephthali a thousand captains, and with them [men] with shields and spears, thirty-seven thousand.
013	1CH	012	035	And of the Danites [men] ready for war twenty-eight thousand and eight hundred.
013	1CH	012	036	And of Aser, they that went out to give aid in war, forty thousand.
013	1CH	012	037	And from the country beyond Jordan, from Ruben, and the Gadites, and from the half-tribe of Manasse, a hundred and twenty thousand, with all weapons of war.
013	1CH	012	038	All these [were] men of war, setting [the army] in battle array, with a peaceful mind [towards him], and they came to Chebron to make David king over all Israel: and the rest of Israel [were of] one mind to make David king.
013	1CH	012	039	And they were there three days eating and drinking, for their brethren [had] made preparations.
013	1CH	012	040	And their neighbours, as far as Issachar and Zabulon and Nephthali, brought to them upon camels, and asses, and mules, and upon calves, victuals, meal, cakes of figs, raisins, wine, and oil, calves and sheep abundantly: for [there was] joy in Israel.
013	1CH	013	001	And David took counsel with the captains of thousands and captains of hundreds, [even with] every commander.
013	1CH	013	002	And David said to the whole congregation of Israel, If it [seem] good to you, and it should be prospered by the Lord our God, let us send to our brethren that are left in all the land of Israel, and let the priests the Levites who are with them in the cities of their possession [come], and let them be gathered to us.
013	1CH	013	003	And let us bring over to us the ark of our God; for men have not enquired [at] it since the days of Saul.
013	1CH	013	004	And all the congregation said that they would do thus; for the saying was right in the eyes of all the people.
013	1CH	013	005	So David assembled all Israel, from the borders of Egypt even to the entering in of Hemath, to bring in the ark of God from the city of Jarim.
013	1CH	013	006	And David brought it up: and all Israel went up to the city of David, which belonged to Juda, to bring up thence the ark of the Lord God who sits between the cherubim, whose name is called [on it].
013	1CH	013	007	And they set the ark of God on a new waggon [brought] out of the house of Aminadab: and Oza and his brethren drove the waggon.
013	1CH	013	008	And David and all Israel [were] playing before the Lord with all their might, and [that] together with singers, and with harps, and with lutes, with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.
013	1CH	013	009	And they came as far as the threshing-floor: and Oza put forth his hand to hold the ark, because the bullock moved it from [its place].
013	1CH	013	010	And the Lord was very angry with Oza, and smote him there, because of his stretching forth his hand upon the ark: and he died there before God.
013	1CH	013	011	And David was dispirited, because the Lord [had] made a breach on Oza: and he called that place the Breach of Oza until this day.
013	1CH	013	012	And David feared God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God in to myself?
013	1CH	013	013	So David brought not the ark home to himself into the city of David, but he turned it aside into the house of Abeddara the Gethite.
013	1CH	013	014	And the ark of God abode in the house of Abeddara three months: and God blessed Abeddara and all that he had.
013	1CH	014	001	And Chiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar timbers, and masons, and carpenters, to build a house for him.
013	1CH	014	002	And David knew that the Lord [had] designed him to be king over Israel; because his kingdom was highly exalted, on account of his people Israel.
013	1CH	014	003	And David took more wives in Jerusalem: and there were born to David more sons and daughters.
013	1CH	014	004	And these [are] the names of those that were born, who were [born] to him in Jerusalem; Samaa, Sobab, Nathan, and Solomon,
013	1CH	014	005	and Baar, and Elisa, and Eliphaleth,
013	1CH	014	006	and Nageth, and Naphath, and Japhie,
013	1CH	014	007	and Elisamae, and Eliade, and Eliphala.
013	1CH	014	008	And the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel: and all the Philistines went up to seek David; and David heard [it], and went out to meet them.
013	1CH	014	009	And the Philistines came and assembled together in the giants' valley.
013	1CH	014	010	And David enquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? and wilt thou deliver them into my hand? And the Lord said to him, Go up, and I will deliver them into thy hands.
013	1CH	014	011	And he went up to Baal Pharasin, and David smote them there; and David said, God has broken through enemies by my hand like a breach of water: therefore he called the name of that place, the Breach of Pharasin.
013	1CH	014	012	And the Philistines left their gods there; and David gave orders to burn them with fire.
013	1CH	014	013	And the Philistines once more assembled themselves in the giants' valley.
013	1CH	014	014	And David enquired of God again; and God said to him, Thou shalt not go after them; turn away from them, and thou shalt come upon them near the pear trees.
013	1CH	014	015	And it shall be, when thou shalt hear the sound of their tumult in the tops of the pear trees, then thou shalt go into the battle: for God has gone out before thee to smite the army of the Philistines.
013	1CH	014	016	And he did as God commanded him: and he smote the army of the Philistines from Gabaon to Gazera.
013	1CH	014	017	And the name of David was [famous] in all the land; and the Lord put the terror of him on all the nations.
013	1CH	015	001	And [David] made for himself houses in the city of David, and he prepared a place for the ark of God, and made a tent for it.
013	1CH	015	002	Then said David, It is not [lawful for any] to bear the ark of God, but the Levites; for the Lord has chosen them to bear the ark of the Lord, and to minister to him for ever.
013	1CH	015	003	And David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the Lord to the place which he [had] prepared for it.
013	1CH	015	004	And David gathered together the sons of Aaron the Levites.
013	1CH	015	005	Of the sons of Caath; [there was] Uriel the chief, and his brethren, a hundred and twenty.
013	1CH	015	006	Of the sons of Merari; Asaia the chief, and his brethren, two hundred and twenty.
013	1CH	015	007	Of the sons of Gedson; Joel the chief, and his brethren, a hundred and thirty.
013	1CH	015	008	Of the sons of Elisaphat; Semei the chief, and his brethren, two hundred.
013	1CH	015	009	Of the sons of Chebrom; Eliel the chief, and his brethren eighty.
013	1CH	015	010	Of the sons of Oziel; Aminadab the chief, and his brethren a hundred and twelve.
013	1CH	015	011	And David called Sadoc and Abiathar the priests, and the Levites, Uriel, Asaia, and Joel, and Semaia, and Eliel, and Aminadab,
013	1CH	015	012	and said to them, Ye [are] the heads of the families of the Levites: sanctify yourselves, you and your brethren, and ye shall carry up the ark of the God of Israel, [to the place] which I have prepared for it.
013	1CH	015	013	For because ye were not [ready] at the first, our God made a breach upon us, because we sought him not according to the ordinance.
013	1CH	015	014	So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves, to bring up the ark of the God of Israel.
013	1CH	015	015	And the sons of the Levites took the ark of God, (as Moses commanded by the word of God according to the scripture) upon their shoulders with staves.
013	1CH	015	016	And David said to the chiefs of the Levites, Set your brethren the singers with musical instruments, lutes, harps, and cymbals, to sound aloud with a voice of joy.
013	1CH	015	017	So the Levites appointed Aeman the son of Joel; Asaph the son of Barachias [was one] of his brethren; and Aethan the son of Kisaeus was of the sons of Merari their brethren;
013	1CH	015	018	and with them their brethren of the second rank, Zacharias, and Oziel, and Semiramoth, and Jeiel, and Elioel, and Eliab, and Banaia, and Maasaia, and Matthathia, and Eliphena, and Makellia, and Abdedom, and Jeiel, and Ozias, the porters.
013	1CH	015	019	And the singers, Aeman, Asaph, and Aethan, with brazen cymbals to make [a sound] to be heard.
013	1CH	015	020	Zacharias, and Oziel, Semiramoth, Jeiel, Oni, Eliab, Maasaeas, Banaeas, with lutes, on alaemoth.
013	1CH	015	021	And Mattathias, and Eliphalu, and Makenia, and Abdedom, and Jeiel, and Ozias, with harps of Amasenith, to make a loud noise.
013	1CH	015	022	And Chonenia chief of the Levites [was] master of the bands, because he was skilful.
013	1CH	015	023	And Barachia and Elcana [were] door-keepers of the ark.
013	1CH	015	024	And Somnia, and Josaphat, and Nathanael, and Amasai, and Zacharia, and Banaea, and Eliezer, the priests, were sounding with trumpets before the ark of God: and Abdedom and Jeia [were] door-keepers of the ark of God.
013	1CH	015	025	So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains of thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant from the house of Abdedom with gladness.
013	1CH	015	026	And it came to pass when God strengthened the Levites bearing the ark of the covenant of the Lord, that they sacrificed seven calves and seven rams.
013	1CH	015	027	And David [was] girt with a fine linen robe, and all the Levites [who were] bearing the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and the singers, and Chonenias the master of the band of singers; also upon David [there was] a robe of fine linen.
013	1CH	015	028	And all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the Lord with shouting, and with the sound of a horn, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, playing loudly on lutes and harps.
013	1CH	015	029	And the ark of the covenant of the Lord arrived, and came to the city of David; and Melchol the daughter of Saul looked down through the window, and saw king David dancing and playing: and she despised him in her heart.
013	1CH	016	001	So they brought in the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tabernacle which David pitched for it; and they offered whole-burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before God.
013	1CH	016	002	And David finished offering up whole-burnt-offerings and peace-offerings, and blessed the people in the name of the Lord.
013	1CH	016	003	And he divided to every man of Israel (both men and women), to [every] man one baker's loaf, and a cake.
013	1CH	016	004	And he appointed before the ark of the covenant of the Lord, Levites to minister [and] lift up the voice, and to give thanks and praise the Lord God of Israel:
013	1CH	016	005	Asaph [was] the chief, and next to him Zacharias, Jeiel, Semiramoth, and Jeiel, Mattathias, Eliab, and Banaeas, and Abdedom: and Jeiel sounding with musical instruments, lutes [and] harps, and Asaph with cymbals:
013	1CH	016	006	and Banaeas and Oziel the priests [sounding] continually with trumpets before the ark of the covenant of God in that day.
013	1CH	016	007	Then David first gave orders to praise the Lord by the hand of Asaph and his brethren.
013	1CH	016	008	Song. Give thanks to the Lord, call upon him by his name, make known his designs among the people.
013	1CH	016	009	Sing [songs] to him, and sing hymns to him, relate to all [people] his wonderful deeds, which the Lord has wrought.
013	1CH	016	010	Praise his holy name, the heart that seeks his pleasure shall rejoice.
013	1CH	016	011	Seek the Lord and be strong, seek his face continually.
013	1CH	016	012	Remember his wonderful works which he has wrought, his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;
013	1CH	016	013	[ye] seed of Israel his servants, [ye] seed of Jacob his chosen ones.
013	1CH	016	014	He [is] the Lord our God; his judgments [are] in all the earth.
013	1CH	016	015	Let us remember his covenant for ever, his word which he commanded to a thousand generations,
013	1CH	016	016	which he covenanted with Abraham, and his oath [sworn] to Isaac.
013	1CH	016	017	He confirmed it to Jacob for an ordinance, to Israel [as] an everlasting covenant,
013	1CH	016	018	saying, To thee will I give the land of Chanaan, the line of your inheritance:
013	1CH	016	019	when they were few in number, when they were but little, and dwelt as strangers in it;
013	1CH	016	020	and went from nation to nation, and from one kingdom to another people.
013	1CH	016	021	He suffered not a man to oppress them, and he reproved kings for their sakes,
013	1CH	016	022	saying, Touch not my anointed ones, and deal not wrongfully with my prophets.
013	1CH	016	023	Sing ye to the Lord, all the earth; proclaim his salvation from day to day.
013	1CH	016	024	Declare among the nations his glory, his wondrous deeds among all peoples.
013	1CH	016	025	For the Lord [is] great, and greatly to be praised: he [is] to be feared above all gods.
013	1CH	016	026	For all the gods of the nations [are] idols; but our God made the heavens.
013	1CH	016	027	Glory and praise [are] in his presence; strength and rejoicing [are] in his place.
013	1CH	016	028	Give to the Lord, ye families of the nations, give to the Lord glory and strength.
013	1CH	016	029	Give to the Lord the glory [belonging] to his name: take gifts and offer [them] before him; and worship the Lord in his holy courts.
013	1CH	016	030	Let the whole earth fear before him; let the earth be established, and not be moved.
013	1CH	016	031	Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth exult; and let them say among the nations, The Lord reigns.
013	1CH	016	032	The sea with its fullness shall resound and the tree of the field, and all things in it.
013	1CH	016	033	Then shall the trees of the wood rejoice before the Lord, for he is come to judge the earth.
013	1CH	016	034	Give thanks to the Lord, for [it is] good, for his mercy [is] for ever.
013	1CH	016	035	And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us, and rescue us from among the heathen, that we may praise thy holy name, and glory in thy praises.
013	1CH	016	036	Blessed [be] the Lord God of Israel from everlasting and to everlasting: And all the people shall say, Amen. So they praised the Lord.
013	1CH	016	037	And they left there Asaph and his brethren before the ark of the covenant of the Lord, to minister before the ark continually, according to the service of each day: from day to day.
013	1CH	016	038	And Abdedom and his brethren [were] sixty and eight; and Abdedom the son of Idithun, and Osa, [were] to be door-keepers.
013	1CH	016	039	And [they appointed] Sadoc the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of the Lord in the high place in Gabaon,
013	1CH	016	040	to offer up whole-burnt-offerings continually morning and evening, and according to all things written in the law of the Lord, which he commanded the children of Israel by Moses the servant of God.
013	1CH	016	041	And with him [were] Aeman and Idithun, and the rest chosen out by name to praise the Lord, for his mercy [endures] for ever.
013	1CH	016	042	And with them [there were] trumpets and cymbals to sound aloud, and musical instruments for the songs of God: and the sons of Idithun [were] at the gate.
013	1CH	016	043	And all the people went every one to his home: and David returned to bless his house.
013	1CH	017	001	And it came to pass as David dwelt in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, Behold, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of the covenant of the Lord [is] under [curtains] of skins.
013	1CH	017	002	And Nathan said to David, Do all that is in thy heart; for God [is] with thee.
013	1CH	017	003	And it came to pass in that night, that the word of the Lord came to Nathan, [saying],
013	1CH	017	004	Go and say to David my servant, Thus said the Lord, Thou shalt not build me a house for me to dwell in it.
013	1CH	017	005	For I have not dwelt in a house from the day that I brought up Israel until this day, but I have been in a tabernacle and a tent,
013	1CH	017	006	in all places through which I have gone with all Israel: did I ever speak to [any] one tribe of Israel whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, [Why is it] that ye have not built me a house of cedar?
013	1CH	017	007	And now thus shalt thou say to my servant David, Thus saith the Lord Almighty, I took thee from the sheepfold, from following the flocks, to be a ruler over my people Israel:
013	1CH	017	008	and I was with thee in all places whither thou wentest, and I destroyed all thine enemies from before thee, and I made for thee a name according to the name of the great ones that are upon the earth.
013	1CH	017	009	And I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and I will plant him, and he shall dwell by himself, and shall no longer be anxious; and the son of iniquity shall no longer afflict him, as at the beginning,
013	1CH	017	010	and from the days when I appointed judges over my people Israel. Also I have humbled all thine enemies, and I will increase thee, and the Lord will build thee a house.
013	1CH	017	011	And it shall come to pass when thy days shall be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed after thee, which shall be of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.
013	1CH	017	012	He shall build me a house, and I will set up his throne for ever.
013	1CH	017	013	I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son: and my mercy will I not withdraw from him, as I withdrew [it] from them that were before thee.
013	1CH	017	014	And I will establish him in my house and in his kingdom for ever; and his throne shall be set up for ever.
013	1CH	017	015	According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so spoke Nathan to David.
013	1CH	017	016	And king David came and sat before the Lord, and said, Who am I, O Lord God? and what [is] my house, that thou hast loved me for ever?
013	1CH	017	017	And these things were little in thy sight, O God: thou hast also spoken concerning the house of thy servant for a long time to come, and thou hast looked upon me as a man looks upon his fellow, and hast exalted me, O Lord God.
013	1CH	017	018	What shall David do more toward thee to glorify [thee]? and thou knowest thy servant.
013	1CH	017	019	And thou hast wrought all this greatness according to thine heart.
013	1CH	017	020	O Lord, there is none like thee, and there is no God beside thee, according to all things which we have heard with our ears.
013	1CH	017	021	Neither is there another nation upon the earth [such] as thy people Israel, whereas God led him in the way, to redeem a people for himself, to make for himself a great and glorious name, to cast out nations from before thy people, whom thou redeemedst out of Egypt.
013	1CH	017	022	And thou hast appointed thy people Israel as a people to thyself for ever; and thou, Lord, didst become a God to them.
013	1CH	017	023	And now, Lord, let the word which thou spokest to thy servant, and concerning his house, be confirmed for ever, and do thou as thou hast spoken.
013	1CH	017	024	And let thy name [be] established and magnified for ever, [men] saying, Lord, Lord, Almighty God of Israel: and [let] the house of thy servant David [be] established before thee.
013	1CH	017	025	For thou, O Lord my God, hast revealed to the ear of thy servant that thou wilt build him a house; therefore thy servant has found a willingness to pray before thee.
013	1CH	017	026	And now, Lord, thou thyself art God, and thou hast spoken these good things concerning thy servant.
013	1CH	017	027	And now thou hast begun to bless the house of thy servant, so that it should continue for ever before thee: for thou, Lord, hast blessed [it], and do thou bless [it] for ever.
013	1CH	018	001	And it came to pass afterwards, that David smote the Philistines, and routed them, and took Geth and its villages out of the hand of the Philistines.
013	1CH	018	002	And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became servants to David, [and] tributaries.
013	1CH	018	003	And David smote Adraazar king of Suba of Emath, as he was going to establish power toward the river Euphrates.
013	1CH	018	004	And David took of them a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand infantry: and David houghed all the chariot [horses], but there were reserved of them a hundred chariots.
013	1CH	018	005	And the Syrian came from Damascus to help Adraazar king of Suba; and David smote of the Syrian [army] twenty and two thousand men.
013	1CH	018	006	And David put a garrison in Syria near Damascus; and they became tributary servants to David: and the Lord delivered David wherever he went.
013	1CH	018	007	And David took the golden collars that were on the servants of Adraazar, and brought them to Jerusalem.
013	1CH	018	008	And David took out of Matabeth, and out of the chief cities of Adraazar very much brass: of this Solomon made the brazen sea, and the pillars, and the brazen vessels.
013	1CH	018	009	And Thoa king of Emath heard that David had smitten the whole force of Adraazar king of Suba.
013	1CH	018	010	And he sent Aduram his son to king David to ask how he was, and to congratulate him because he had fought against Adraazar, and smitten him; for Thoa was the enemy of Adraazar.
013	1CH	018	011	And all the golden and silver and brazen vessels, even these king David consecrated to the Lord, with the silver and the gold which he took from all the nations; from Idumaea, and Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalec.
013	1CH	018	012	And Abesa son of Saruia smote the Idumeans in the valley of Salt, eighteen thousand.
013	1CH	018	013	And he put garrisons in the valley; and all the Idumaeans became David's servants: and the Lord delivered David wherever he went.
013	1CH	018	014	So David reigned over all Israel; and he executed judgment and justice to all his people.
013	1CH	018	015	And Joab the son of Saruia [was] over the army, and Josaphat the son of Achilud [was] recorder.
013	1CH	018	016	And Sadoc son of Achitob, and Achimelech son of Abiathar, [were] the priests; and Susa [was] the scribe;
013	1CH	018	017	and Banaeas the son of Jodae [was] over the Cherethite and the Phelethite, and the sons of David were the chief deputies of the king.
013	1CH	019	001	And it came to pass after this, [that] Naas the king of the children of Ammon died, and Anan his son reigned in his stead.
013	1CH	019	002	And David said, I will act kindly toward Anan the son of Naas, as his father acted kindly towards me. And David sent messengers to condole with him on the death of his father. So the servants of David came into the land of the children of Ammon to Anan, to comfort him.
013	1CH	019	003	And the chiefs of the children of Ammon said to Anan, Is it to honour thy father before thee, that David has sent comforters to thee? Have not his servants come to thee that they might search the city, and to spy out the land?
013	1CH	019	004	And Anan took the servants of David, and shaved them, and cut off the half of their garments as far as their tunic, and sent them away.
013	1CH	019	005	And there came men to report to David concerning the men: and he sent to meet them, for they were greatly disgraced: and the king said, Dwell in Jericho until your beards have grown, and return.
013	1CH	019	006	And the children of Ammon saw that the people of David were ashamed, and Anan and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire for themselves chariots and horsemen out of Syria of Mesopotamia, and out of Syria Maacha, and from Sobal.
013	1CH	019	007	And they hired for themselves two and thirty thousand chariots, and the king of Maacha and his people; and they came and encamped before Medaba: and the children of Ammon assembled out of their cities, and came to fight.
013	1CH	019	008	And David heard, and sent Joab and all the host of mighty men.
013	1CH	019	009	And the children of Ammon came forth, and set themselves in array for battle by the gate of the city: and the kings that were come forth encamped by themselves in the plain.
013	1CH	019	010	And Joab saw that they were fronting [him] to fight against him before and behind, and he chose [some] out of all the young men of Israel, and they set themselves in array against the Syrian.
013	1CH	019	011	And the rest of the people he gave into the hand of his brother Abesai, and they set themselves in array against the children of Ammon.
013	1CH	019	012	And he said, If the Syrian should prevail against me, then shalt thou deliver me: and if the children of Ammon should prevail against thee, then will I deliver thee.
013	1CH	019	013	Be of good courage, and let us be strong, for our people, and for the cities of our God: and the Lord shall do what [is] good in his eyes.
013	1CH	019	014	So Joab and the people that were with him set themselves in battle array against the Syrians, and they fled from them.
013	1CH	019	015	And the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians fled, and they also fled from before Abesai, and from before Joab his brother, and they came to the city: and Joab came to Jerusalem.
013	1CH	019	016	And the Syrian saw that Israel had defeated him, and he sent messengers, and they brought out the Syrians from beyond the river; and Sophath the commander-in-chief of the forces of Adraazar [was] before them.
013	1CH	019	017	And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel, and crossed over Jordan, and came upon them, and set the battle in array against them. So David set [his army] in array to fight against the Syrians, and they fought against him.
013	1CH	019	018	And the Syrians fled from before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians seven thousand [riders in] chariots, and forty thousand infantry, and he slew Sophath the commander-in-chief of the forces.
013	1CH	019	019	And the servants of Adraazar saw that they were defeated before Israel, and they made peace with David and served him: and the Syrians would not any more help the children of Ammon.
013	1CH	020	001	And it came to pass at the return of the year, at the [time of the] going forth of kings [to war], that Joab gathered the whole force of the army, and they ravaged the land of the children of Ammon; and he came and besieged Rabba. But David abode in Jerusalem. And Joab smote Rabba and destroyed it.
013	1CH	020	002	And David took the crown of Molchom their king off his head, and the weight of it was found [to be] a talent of gold, and on it were precious stones; and it was [placed] on the head of David: and he brought out the spoils of the city [which were] very great.
013	1CH	020	003	And he brought out the people that were in it, and sawed them asunder with saws, and [cut them] with iron axes, and with harrows: and thus David did to all the children of Ammon. And David and all his people returned to Jerusalem.
013	1CH	020	004	And it came to pass afterward that there was again war with the Philistines in Gazer: then Sobochai the Sosathite smote Saphut of the sons of the giants, and laid him low.
013	1CH	020	005	And there [was] war again with the Philistines; and Eleanan the son of Jair smote Lachmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, and the wood of his spear [was] as a weavers' beam.
013	1CH	020	006	And there was again war in Geth, and there was a man of extraordinary size, and his fingers [and toes were] six on each hand and foot, four and twenty; and he was descended from the giants.
013	1CH	020	007	And he defied Israel, and Jonathan the son of Samaa the brother of David slew him.
013	1CH	020	008	These were born to Rapha in Geth; all four were giants, and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.
013	1CH	021	001	And the devil stood up against Israel, and moved David to number Israel.
013	1CH	021	002	And king David said to Joab and to the captains of the forces, Go, number Israel from Bersabee even to Dan, and bring me [the account], and I shall know their number.
013	1CH	021	003	And Joab said, May the Lord add to his people, a hundred-fold as many as they [are], and [let] the eyes of my lord the king see [it]: all [are] the servants of my lord. Why does my lord seek this thing? [do it not], lest it become a sin to Israel.
013	1CH	021	004	Nevertheless the king's word prevailed against Joab; and Joab went out and passed through all Israel, and came to Jerusalem.
013	1CH	021	005	And Joab gave the number of the mustering of the people to David: and all Israel was a million and a hundred thousand men that drew sword: and the sons of Juda [were] four hundred and seventy thousand men that drew sword.
013	1CH	021	006	But he numbered not Levi and Benjamin among them; for the word of the king was painful to Joab.
013	1CH	021	007	And [there was] evil in the sight of the Lord respecting this thing; and he smote Israel.
013	1CH	021	008	And David said to God, I have sinned exceedingly, in that I have done this thing: and now, I pray thee, remove the sin of thy servant; for I have been exceedingly foolish.
013	1CH	021	009	And the Lord spoke to Gad the seer, saying,
013	1CH	021	010	Go and speak to David, saying, Thus saith the Lord, I bring three things upon thee: choose one of them for thyself, and I will do it to thee.
013	1CH	021	011	And Gad came to David, and said to him, Thus saith the Lord, Choose for thyself,
013	1CH	021	012	either three years of famine, or that thou shouldest flee three months from the face of thine enemies, and the sword of thine enemies [shall be employed] to destroy thee, or that the sword of the Lord and pestilence [should be] three days in the land, and the angel of the Lord [shall be] destroying in all the inheritance of Israel. And now consider what I shall answer to him that sent the message.
013	1CH	021	013	And David said to Gad, They are very hard for me, even [all] the three: let me fall now into the hands of the Lord, for his mercies [are] very abundant, and let me not fall by any means into the hands of man.
013	1CH	021	014	So the Lord brought pestilence upon Israel: and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men.
013	1CH	021	015	And God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was destroying, the Lord saw, and repented for the evil, and said to the angel that was destroying, Let it suffice thee; withhold thine hand. And the angel of the Lord stood by the threshing-floor of Orna the Jebusite.
013	1CH	021	016	And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the Lord, standing between the earth and the heaven, and his sword drawn in his hand, stretched out over Jerusalem: and David and the elders clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces.
013	1CH	021	017	And David said to God, [Was it] not I [that] gave orders to number the people? and I am the guilty one; I have greatly sinned: but these sheep, what have they done? O Lord God, let thy hand be upon me, and upon my father's house, and not on thy people for destruction, O Lord!
013	1CH	021	018	And the angel of the Lord told Gad to tell David, that he should go up to erect and altar to the Lord, in the threshing-floor of Orna the Jebusite.
013	1CH	021	019	And David went up according to the word of Gad, which he spoke in the name of the Lord.
013	1CH	021	020	And Orna turned and saw the king; and he hid himself and his four sons with him. Now Orna was threshing wheat.
013	1CH	021	021	And David came to Orna; and Orna came forth from the threshing-floor, and did obeisance to David with his face to the ground.
013	1CH	021	022	And David said to Orna, Give me thy place of the threshing-floor, and I will build upon it an altar to the Lord: give it me for its worth in money, and the plague shall cease from [among] the people.
013	1CH	021	023	And Orna said to David, Take it to thyself, and let my lord the king do what is right in his eyes: see, I have given the calves for a whole-burnt-offering, and the plough for wood, and the corn for a meat-offering; I have given all.
013	1CH	021	024	And king David said to Orna, Nay; for I will surely buy it for its worth in money: for I will not take thy property for the Lord, to offer a whole-burnt-offering to the Lord without cost [to myself].
013	1CH	021	025	And David gave to Orna for his place six hundred shekels of gold [by] weight.
013	1CH	021	026	And David built there an altar to the Lord, and offered up whole-burnt-offerings and peace-offerings: and he cried to the Lord, and he answered him by fire out of heaven on the altar of whole-burnt-offerings, and [it] consumed the whole-burnt-offering.
013	1CH	021	027	And the Lord spoke to the angel; and he put up the sword into its sheath.
013	1CH	021	028	At that time when David saw that the Lord answered him in the threshing-floor of Orna the Jebusite, he also sacrificed there.
013	1CH	021	029	And the tabernacle of the Lord which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of whole-burnt-offerings, [were] at that time in the high place at Gabaon.
013	1CH	021	030	And David could not go before it to enquire of God; for he hasted not because of the sword of the angel of the Lord.
013	1CH	022	001	And David said, This is the house of the Lord God, and this [is] the altar for whole-burnt-offering for Israel.
013	1CH	022	002	And David gave orders to gather all the strangers that were in the land of Israel; and he appointed stone-hewers to hew polished stones to build the house to God.
013	1CH	022	003	And David prepared much iron for the nails of the doors and the gate; the hinges also and brass in abundance, there was no weighing [of it].
013	1CH	022	004	And cedar threes without number: for the Sidonians and the Tyrians brought cedar trees in abundance to David.
013	1CH	022	005	And David said, My son Solomon [is] a tender child, and the house [for me] to build to the Lord [is] for superior magnificence for a name and for a glory through all the earth: I will make preparation for it. And David prepared abundantly before his death.
013	1CH	022	006	And he called Solomon his son, and commanded him to build the house for the Lord God of Israel.
013	1CH	022	007	And David said to Solomon, [My] child, it was in my heart to build a house to the name of the Lord God.
013	1CH	022	008	But the word of the Lord came to me, saying, Thou hast shed blood abundantly, and hast carried on great wars: thou shalt not build a house to my name, because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth before me.
013	1CH	022	009	Behold, a son shall be born to thee, he shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about: for his name [shall be] Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness to Israel in his days.
013	1CH	022	010	He shall build a house to my name; and he shall be a son to me, and I will be a father to him; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom in Israel for ever.
013	1CH	022	011	And now, my son, the Lord shall be with thee, and prosper [thee]; and thou shalt build a house to the Lord thy God, as he spoke concerning thee.
013	1CH	022	012	Only may the Lord give thee wisdom and prudence, and strengthen thee over Israel, both to keep and to do the law of the Lord thy God.
013	1CH	022	013	Then will he prosper [thee], if thou take heed to do the commandments and judgments which the Lord commanded Moses for Israel: be courageous and strong; fear not, nor be terrified.
013	1CH	022	014	And, behold, I according to my poverty have prepared for the house of the Lord a hundred thousand talents of gold, and a million talents of silver, and brass and iron without measure; for it is abundant; and I have prepared timber and stones; and do thou add to these.
013	1CH	022	015	And [of them that are] with thee do thou add to the multitude of workmen; [let there be] artificers and masons, and carpenters, and every skilful [workman] in every work;
013	1CH	022	016	in gold and silver, brass and iron, [of which] there is no number. Arise and do, and the Lord [be] with thee.
013	1CH	022	017	And David charged all the chief men of Israel to help Solomon his son, [saying],
013	1CH	022	018	[Is] not the Lord with you? and he has given you rest round about, for he has given into your hands the inhabitants of the land; and the land is subdued before the Lord, and before his people.
013	1CH	022	019	Now set your hearts and souls to seek after the Lord your God: and rise, and build a sanctuary to your God to carry in the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and the holy vessels of God, into the house that is to be built to the name of the Lord.
013	1CH	023	001	And David was old and full of days; and he made Solomon his son king over Israel in his stead.
013	1CH	023	002	And he assembled all the chief men of Israel, and the priests, and the Levites.
013	1CH	023	003	And the Levites numbered [themselves] from thirty years old and upward; and their number by their polls amounted to thirty and eight thousand men.
013	1CH	023	004	Of the overseers over the works of the house of the Lord [there were] twenty-four thousand, and [there were] six thousand scribes and judges;
013	1CH	023	005	and four thousand door-keepers, and four thousand to praise the Lord with instruments which he made to praise the Lord.
013	1CH	023	006	And David divided them [into] daily courses, for the sons of Levi, for Gedson, Caath, and Merari.
013	1CH	023	007	And for [the family of] Gedson, Edan, and Semei.
013	1CH	023	008	The sons of Edan [were] Jeiel, the chief, and Zethan, and Joel, three.
013	1CH	023	009	The sons of Semei; Salomith, Jeiel, and Dan, three: these [were] the chiefs of the families of Edan.
013	1CH	023	010	And to the sons of Semei, Jeth, and Ziza, and Joas, and Beria: these [were] the four sons of Semei.
013	1CH	023	011	And Jeth was the chief, and Ziza the second: and Joas and Beria did not multiply sons, and they became [only] one reckoning according to the house of their father.
013	1CH	023	012	The sons of Caath; Ambram, Isaar, Chebron, Oziel, four.
013	1CH	023	013	The sons of Ambram; Aaron and Moses: and Aaron was appointed for the consecration of the most holy things, he and his sons for ever, to burn incense before the Lord, to minister and bless in his name for ever.
013	1CH	023	014	And [as for] Moses the man of God, his sons were reckoned to the tribe of Levi.

013	1CH	023	016	The sons of Gersam; Subael the chief.
013	1CH	023	017	And the sons of Eliezer were, Rabia the chief: and Eliezer had no other sons; but the sons of Rabia were very greatly multiplied.

013	1CH	023	024	These [are] the sons of Levi according to the houses of their fathers; chiefs of their families according to their numbering, according to the number of their names, according to their polls, doing the works of service of the house of the Lord, from twenty years old and upward.
013	1CH	023	025	For David said, The Lord God of Israel has given rest to his people, and has taken up his abode in Jerusalem for ever.
013	1CH	023	026	And the Levites bore not the tabernacle, and all the vessels of it for its service.
013	1CH	023	027	For by the last words of David was the number of the Levites [taken] from twenty years old and upward.
013	1CH	023	028	For he appointed them to wait on Aaron, to minister in the house of the Lord, over the courts, and over the chambers, and over the purification of all the holy things, and over the works of the service of the house of God;
013	1CH	023	029	and for the shew-bread, and for the fine flour of the meat-offering, and for the unleavened cakes, and for the fried cake, and for the dough, and for every measure;

013	1CH	023	032	And they are to keep the charge of the tabernacle of witness, and the charge of the holy place, and the charges of the sons of Aaron their brethren, to minister in the house of the Lord.
013	1CH	024	001	And [they number] the sons of Aaron in [their] division, Nadab, and Abiud, and Eleazar, and Ithamar.
013	1CH	024	002	And Nadab and Abiud died before their father, and they had no sons: so Eleazar and Ithamar the sons of Aaron ministered as priests.
013	1CH	024	003	And David distributed them, even Sadoc of the sons of Eleazar, and Achimelech of the sons of Ithamar, according to their numbering, according to their service, according to the houses of their fathers.
013	1CH	024	004	And there were found [among] the sons of Eleazar more chiefs of the mighty ones, than of the sons of Ithamar: and he divided them, sixteen heads of families to the sons of Eleazar, eight according to [their] families to the sons of Ithamar.
013	1CH	024	005	And he divided them according to their lots, one with the other; for there were those who had charge of the holy things, and those who had charge of the [house] of the Lord among the sons of Eleazar, and among the sons of Ithamar.

013	1CH	026	031	Of the [family] of Chebron Urias [was] chief, even of the Chebronites according to their generations, according to their families. In the fortieth year of his reign they were numbered, and there were found mighty men among them in Jazer of Galaad.
013	1CH	026	032	And his brethren [were] two thousand seven hundred mighty men, chiefs of their families, and king David set them over the Rubenites, and the Gaddites, and the half-tribe of Manasse, for every ordinance of the Lord, and business of the king.

013	1CH	027	023	But David took not their number from twenty years old and under: because the Lord said that he would multiply Israel as the stars of the heaven.
013	1CH	027	024	And Joab the son of Saruia began to number the people, and did not finish the work, for there was hereupon wrath on Israel; and the number was not recorded in the book of the chronicles of king David.
013	1CH	027	025	And over the king's treasures [was] Asmoth the son of Odiel; and over the treasures in the country, and in the towns, and in the villages, and in the towers, [was] Jonathan the son of Ozia.

013	1CH	027	033	Achitophel [was] the king's counsellor: and Chusi the chief friend of the king.
013	1CH	027	034	And after this Achitophel Jodae the son of Banaeas [came] next, and Abiathar: and Joab [was] the king's commander-in-chief.
013	1CH	028	001	And David assembled all the chief [men] of Israel, the chief of the judges, and all the chief [men] of the courses [of attendance] on the person of the king, and the captains of thousands and hundreds, and the treasurers, and the lords of his substance, and of all the king's property, and of his sons, together with the eunuchs, and the mighty men, and the warriors of the army, at Jerusalem.
013	1CH	028	002	And David stood in the midst of the assembly, and said, Hear me, my brethren, and my people: it was in my heart to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and a place for the feet of our Lord, and I prepared [materials] suitable for the building:
013	1CH	028	003	but God said, Thou shalt not build me a house to call my name upon it, for thou art a man of war, and hast shed blood.
013	1CH	028	004	Yet the Lord God of Israel chose me out of the whole house of my father to be king over Israel for ever; and he chose Juda as the kingly [house], and out of the house of Juda [he chose] the house of my father; and among the sons of my father he preferred me, that I should be king over all Israel.
013	1CH	028	005	And of all my sons, (for the Lord has given me many sons,) he has chosen Solomon my son, to set him on the throne of the kingdom of the Lord over Israel.
013	1CH	028	006	And God said to me, Solomon thy son shall build my house and my court: for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be to him a father.
013	1CH	028	007	And I will establish his kingdom for ever, if he continue to keep my commandments, and my judgments, as [at] this day.
013	1CH	028	008	And now [I charge you] before the whole assembly of the Lord, and in the audience of our God, keep and seek all the commandments of the Lord our God, that ye may inherit the good land, and leave it for your sons to inherit after you for ever.
013	1CH	028	009	And now, [my] son Solomon, know the God of thy fathers, and serve him with a perfect heart and willing soul: for the Lord searches all hearts, and knows every thought: if thou seek him, he will be found of thee; but if thou shouldest forsake him, he will forsake thee for ever.
013	1CH	028	010	See now, for the Lord has chosen thee to build him a house for a sanctuary, be strong and do [it].
013	1CH	028	011	And David gave Solomon his son the plan of the temple, and its buildings, and its treasuries, and its upper chambers, and the inner store-rooms, and the place of the atonement,
013	1CH	028	012	and the plan which he had in his mind of the courts of the house of the Lord, and of all the chambers round about, [designed] for the treasuries of the house of God, and of the treasuries of the holy things, and of the chambers for resting:
013	1CH	028	013	and [the plan] of the courses of the priests and Levites, for all the work of the service of the house of the Lord, and of the stores of vessels for ministration of the service of the house of the Lord.
013	1CH	028	014	And [he gave him] the account of their weight, both of gold and silver [vessels].
013	1CH	028	015	He gave him the weight of the candlesticks, and of the lamps.
013	1CH	028	016	He gave him likewise the weight of the tables of shewbread, of each table of gold, and likewise of the [tables of] silver:
013	1CH	028	017	also of the flesh-hooks, and vessels for drink-offering, and golden bowls: and the weight of the gold and silver [articles], and censers, [and] bowls, according to the weight of each.
013	1CH	028	018	And he shewed him the weight [of the utensils] of the altar of incense, [which was] of pure gold, and the plan of the chariot of the cherubs that spread out their wings, and overshadowed the ark of the covenant of the Lord.
013	1CH	028	019	David gave all to Solomon in the Lord's handwriting, according to the knowledge given him of the work of the pattern.
013	1CH	028	020	And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong, and play the man, and do: fear not, neither be terrified; for the Lord my God [is] with thee; he will not forsake thee, and will not fail thee, until thou hast finished all the work of the service of the house of the Lord. And behold the pattern of the temple, even his house, and its treasury, and the upper chambers, and the inner store-rooms, and the place of propitiation, and the plan of the house of the Lord.
013	1CH	028	021	And see, [here are] the courses of the priests and Levites for all the service of the house of the Lord, and [there shall be] with thee [men] for every workmanship, and every one of ready skill in every art: also the chief men and all the people, [ready] for all thy commands.
013	1CH	029	001	And David the king said to all the congregation, Solomon my son, whom the Lord has chosen, [is] young and tender, and the work [is] great; for [it is] not for man, but for the Lord God.
013	1CH	029	002	I have prepared according to all [my] might for the house of my God gold, silver, brass, iron, wood, onyx stones, and costly and variegated stones for setting, and every precious stone, and much Parian [marble].
013	1CH	029	003	And still farther, because I took pleasure in the house of my God, I have gold and silver which I have procured for myself, and, behold, I have given them to the house of my God over and above, beyond what I have prepared for the holy house.
013	1CH	029	004	Three thousand talents of gold of Suphir, and seven thousand talents of fine silver, for the overlaying of the walls of the sanctuary:
013	1CH	029	005	[for thee to use] the gold for [things of] gold, and the silver for things of silver, and for every work by the hand of the artificers. And who is willing to dedicate himself in work this day for the Lord?
013	1CH	029	006	Then the heads of families, and the princes of the children of Israel, and the captains of thousands and captains of hundreds, and the overseers of the works, and the king's builders, offered willingly.
013	1CH	029	007	And they gave for the works of the house of the Lord five thousand talents of gold, and ten thousand gold [pieces], and ten thousand talents of silver, and eighteen thousand talents of brass, and a hundred thousand talents of iron.
013	1CH	029	008	And they who had [precious] stone, gave it into the treasuries of the house of the Lord by the hand of Jeiel the Gedsonite.
013	1CH	029	009	And the people rejoiced because of the willingness, for they offered willingly to the Lord with a full heart: and king David rejoiced greatly.
013	1CH	029	010	And king David blessed the Lord before the congregation, saying, Blessed art thou, O Lord God of Israel, our Father, from everlasting and to everlasting.
013	1CH	029	011	Thine, O Lord, [is] the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the might: for thou art Lord of all things that are in heaven and upon the earth: before thy face every king and nation is troubled.
013	1CH	029	012	From thee [come] wealth and glory: thou, O Lord, rulest over all, the Lord of all dominion, and in thy hand [is] strength and rule; and [thou art] almighty with thy hand to increase and establish all things.
013	1CH	029	013	And now, Lord, we give thanks to thee, and praise thy glorious name.
013	1CH	029	014	But who am I, and what [is] my people, that we have been able to be thus forward [in offering] to thee? for all things [are] thine, and of thine own have we given thee,
013	1CH	029	015	for we are strangers before thee, and sojourners, as all our fathers [were]: our days upon the earth [are] as a shadow, and there is no remaining.
013	1CH	029	016	O Lord our God, as for all this abundance which I have prepared that a house should be built to thy holy name, it is of thy hand, and all [is] thine.
013	1CH	029	017	And I know, Lord, that thou art he that searches the hearts, and thou lovest righteousness. I have willingly offered all these things in simplicity of heart; and now I have seen with joy thy people here present, willingly offering to thee.
013	1CH	029	018	O Lord God of Abraham, and Isaac, and Israel, our fathers, preserve these things in the thought of the heart of thy people for ever, and direct their hearts to thee.
013	1CH	029	019	And to Solomon my son give a good heart, to perform thy commandments, and [to observe] thy testimonies, and thine ordinances, and to accomplish the building of thy house.
013	1CH	029	020	And David said to the whole congregation, Bless ye the Lord our God. And all the congregation blessed the Lord God of their fathers, and they bowed the knee and worshipped the Lord, and [did obeisance] to the king.
013	1CH	029	021	And David sacrificed to the Lord, and offered up whole-burnt-offerings to the Lord on the morrow after the first day, a thousand calves, a thousand rams, a thousand lambs, and their drink-offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel.
013	1CH	029	022	And they ate and drank joyfully that day before the Lord: and they made Solomon the son of David king a second time, and anointed him king before the Lord, and Sadoc to the priesthood.
013	1CH	029	023	And Solomon sat upon the throne of his father David, and was highly honoured; and all Israel obeyed him.
013	1CH	029	024	The princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons of king David his father, were subject to him.
013	1CH	029	025	And the Lord magnified Solomon over all Israel, and gave him royal glory, such as was not upon any king before him.
013	1CH	029	026	And David the son of Jessae reigned over Israel forty years;
013	1CH	029	027	seven years in Chebron, and thirty-three years in Jerusalem.
013	1CH	029	028	And he died in a good old age, full of days, in wealth, and glory: and Solomon his son reigned in his stead.
013	1CH	029	029	And the rest of the acts of David, the former and the latter, are written in the history of Samuel the seer, and in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the history of Gad the seer,
013	1CH	029	030	concerning all his reign, and his power, and the times which went over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the earth.

014	2CH	001	001	And Solomon the son of David was established over his kingdom, and the Lord his God was with him, and increased him exceedingly.
014	2CH	001	002	And Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the captains of thousands, and to the captains of hundreds, and to the judges, and to all the rulers over Israel, even the heads of the families;
014	2CH	001	003	and Solomon and all the congregation went to the high place that was in Gabaon, where was God's tabernacle of witness, which Moses the servant of the Lord made in the wilderness.
014	2CH	001	004	But David had brought up the ark of God out of the city of Cariathiarim; for David had prepared a place for it, for he had pitched a tabernacle for it in Jerusalem.
014	2CH	001	005	And the brazen altar which Beseleel the son of Urias, the son of Or, had made, was there before the tabernacle of the Lord: and Solomon and the congregation enquired at it.
014	2CH	001	006	And Solomon brought [victims] thither to the brazen altar that was before the Lord in the tabernacle, and offered upon it a thousand whole-burnt-offerings.
014	2CH	001	007	In that night God appeared to Solomon, and said to him, Ask what I shall give thee.
014	2CH	001	008	And Solomon said to God, Thou hast dealt very mercifully with my father David, and hast made me king in his stead.
014	2CH	001	009	And now, O Lord God, let, I pray thee, thy name be established upon David my father; for thou hast made me king over a people numerous as the dust of the earth.
014	2CH	001	010	Now give me wisdom and understanding, that I may go out and come in before this people: for who shall judge this thy great people?
014	2CH	001	011	And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thy heart, and thou hast not asked great wealth, nor glory, nor the life of thine enemies, and thou hast not asked long life; but hast asked for thyself wisdom and understanding, that thou mightest judge my people, over whom I have made thee king:
014	2CH	001	012	I give thee this wisdom and understanding; and I will give thee wealth, and riches, and glory, so that there shall not have been [any] like thee among the kings before thee, neither shall there be such after thee.
014	2CH	001	013	And Solomon came from the high place that was in Gabaon to Jerusalem, [from] before the tabernacle of witness, and reigned over Israel.
014	2CH	001	014	And Solomon collected chariots and horsemen: and he had fourteen hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen: and he set them in the cities of chariots, and the people [were] with the king in Jerusalem.
014	2CH	001	015	And the king made silver and gold in Jerusalem [to be] as stones, and cedars in Judea as sycamores in the plain for multitude.
014	2CH	001	016	And Solomon imported horses from Egypt, and the charge of the king's merchants for going [was as follows], and they traded,
014	2CH	001	017	and went and brought out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred [pieces] of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty [pieces] of silver: and so they brought for all the kings of the Chettites, and for the kings of Syria by their means.
014	2CH	002	001	And Solomon said that he would build a house to the name of the Lord, and a house for his kingdom.
014	2CH	002	002	And Solomon gathered seventy thousand men that bore burdens, and eighty thousand hewers of stone in the mountain, and [there were] three thousand six hundred superintendents over them.
014	2CH	002	003	And Solomon sent to Chiram king of Tyre, saying, Whereas thou didst deal [favourably] with David my father, and didst send him cedars to build for himself a house to dwell in,
014	2CH	002	004	behold, I also his son am building a house to the name of the Lord my God, to consecrate it to him, to burn incense before him, and [to offer] shewbread continually, and to offer up whole-burnt-offerings continually morning and evening, and on the sabbaths, and at the new moons, and at the feasts of the Lord our God: this [is] a perpetual [statute] for Israel.
014	2CH	002	005	And the house which I am building [is to be] great: for the Lord our God [is] great beyond all gods.
014	2CH	002	006	And who will be able to build him a house? for the heaven and heaven of heavens do not bear his glory: and who am I, that I should build him a house, save only to burn incense before him?
014	2CH	002	007	And now send me a man wise and skilled to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and in scarlet, and in blue, and one that knows how to grave together with the craftsmen who are with me in Juda and in Jerusalem, which materials my father David prepared.
014	2CH	002	008	And send me from Libanus cedar wood, and wood of juniper, and pine; for I know that thy servants are skilled in cutting timber in Libanus: and, behold, thy servants shall go with my servants,
014	2CH	002	009	to prepare timber for me in abundance: for the house which I am building [must be] great and glorious.
014	2CH	002	010	And, behold, I have given freely to thy servants that work and cut the wood, corn for food, [even] twenty thousand measures of wheat, and twenty thousand measures of barley, and twenty thousand measures of wine, and twenty thousand measures of oil.
014	2CH	002	011	And Chiram king of Tyre answered in writing, and sent to Solomon, saying, Because the Lord loved his people, he made thee king over them.
014	2CH	002	012	And Chiram said, Blessed [be] the Lord God of Israel, who made heaven and earth, who has given to king David a wise son, and one endowed with knowledge and understanding, who shall build a house for the Lord, and a house for his kingdom.
014	2CH	002	013	And now I have sent thee a wise and understanding man [who belonged] to Chiram my father
014	2CH	002	014	(his mother [was] of the daughters of Dan, and his father [was] a Tyrian), skilled to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in stones and wood; and to weave with purple, and blue, and fine linen, and scarlet; and to engrave, and to understand every device, whatsoever thou shalt give him [to do] with thy craftsmen, and the craftsmen of my lord David thy father.
014	2CH	002	015	And now, the wheat, and the barley, and the oil, and the wine which my lord mentioned, let him send to his servants.
014	2CH	002	016	And we will cut timber out of Libanus according to all thy need, and we will bring it on rafts to the sea of Joppa, and thou shalt bring it to Jerusalem.
014	2CH	002	017	And Solomon gathered all the foreigners that were in the land of Israel, after the numbering with which David his father numbered them; and there were found a hundred and fifty-three thousand six hundred.
014	2CH	002	018	And he made of them seventy thousand burden-bearers, and eighty thousand hewers of stone, and three thousand six hundred taskmasters over the people.
014	2CH	003	001	And Solomon began to build the house of the Lord in Jerusalem in the mount of Amoria, where the Lord appeared to his father David, in the place which David had prepared in the threshing-floor of Orna the Jebusite.
014	2CH	003	002	And he began to build in the second month, in the fourth year of his reign.
014	2CH	003	003	And thus Solomon began to build the house of God: the length in cubits—even the first measurement from end to end, was sixty cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.
014	2CH	003	004	And the portico in front of the house, its length in front of the breadth of the house [was] twenty cubits, and its height a hundred and twenty cubits: and he gilded it within with pure gold.
014	2CH	003	005	And he lined the great house with cedar wood, and gilded it with pure gold, and carved upon it palm-trees and chains.
014	2CH	003	006	And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty; and he gilded it with gold of the gold from Pharuim.
014	2CH	003	007	And he gilded the house, and its [inner] walls, and the door-posts, and the roofs, and the doors with gold; and he carved cherubs on the walls.
014	2CH	003	008	And he built the holy of holies, its length was according to the front [of the other house], the breadth of the house [was] twenty cubits, and the length twenty cubits: and he gilded [it] with pure gold for cherubs, to [the amount of] six hundred talents.
014	2CH	003	009	And the weight of the nails, [even] the weight of each was fifty shekels of gold: and he gilded the upper chamber with gold.
014	2CH	003	010	And he made two cherubs in the most holy house, wood-work, and he gilded them with gold.
014	2CH	003	011	And the wings of the cherubs were twenty cubits in length: and one wing of five cubits touched the wall of the house: and the other wing of five cubits touched the wing of the other cherub.
014	2CH	003	013	And the wings of these cherubs expanded were of the length of twenty cubits: and they stood upon their feet, and their faces were toward the house.
014	2CH	003	014	And he made the vail of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and wove cherubs in it.
014	2CH	003	015	Also he made in front of the house two pillars, in height thirty-five cubits, and their chapters of five cubits.
014	2CH	003	016	And he made chains, [as] in the oracle, and put [them] on the heads of the pillars; and he made a hundred pomegranates, and put them on the chains.
014	2CH	003	017	And he set up the pillars in front of the temple, one on the right hand and the other on the left: and he called the name of the one on the right hand 'Stability,' and the name of the one on the left 'Strength.'
014	2CH	004	001	And he made a brazen altar, the length of it twenty cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits, and the height ten cubits.
014	2CH	004	002	And he made the molten sea, in diameter ten cubits, entirely round, and the height of it five cubits, and the circumference thirty cubits.
014	2CH	004	003	And beneath it the likeness of calves, they compass it round about: ten cubits compass the laver round about, they cast the calves two rows in their casting,
014	2CH	004	004	wherein they made them twelve calves, —three looking northwards, and three westwards, and three southwards, and three eastwards: and the sea was upon them above, [and] their hinder parts were inward.
014	2CH	004	005	And its thickness was a hand-breadth, and its brim as the brim of a cup, graven with flowers of lilies, holding three thousand measures: and he finished [it].
014	2CH	004	006	And he made ten lavers, and set five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them the instruments of the whole-burnt-offerings, and to rinse [the vessels] in them; and the sea [was] for the priests to wash in.
014	2CH	004	007	And he made the ten golden candlesticks according to their pattern, and he put them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left.
014	2CH	004	008	And he made ten tables, and put them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left: and he made a hundred golden bowls.
014	2CH	004	009	Also he made the priests' court, and the great court, and doors to the court, and their panels [were] overlaid with brass.
014	2CH	004	010	And he set the sea at the corner of the house on the right, as it were fronting the east.
014	2CH	004	011	And Chiram made the fleshhooks, and the fire-pans, and the grate of the altar, and all its instruments: and Chiram finished doing all the work which he wrought for king Solomon in the house of God:
014	2CH	004	012	two pillars, and upon them an embossed work for the chapiters on the heads of the two pillars, and two nets to cover the heads of the chapiters which are on the heads of the pillars;
014	2CH	004	013	and four hundred golden bells for the two nets, and two rows of pomegranates in each net, to cover the two embossed rims of the chapiters which are upon the pillars.
014	2CH	004	014	And he made the ten bases, and he made the lavers upon the bases;
014	2CH	004	015	and the one sea, and the twelve calves under it;
014	2CH	004	016	and the foot-baths, and the buckets, and the caldrons, and the flesh-hooks, and all their furniture (which Chiram made, and brought to king Solomon in the house of the Lord) of pure brass.
014	2CH	004	017	In the country round about Jordan the king cast them, in the clay ground in the house of Socchoth, and between [that and] Saredatha.
014	2CH	004	018	So Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance, for the quantity of brass failed not.
014	2CH	004	019	And Solomon made all the vessels of the house of the Lord, and the golden altar, and the tables, and upon them [were to be] the loaves of shewbread;
014	2CH	004	020	also the candlesticks, and the lamps to give light according to the pattern, and in front of the oracle, of pure gold.
014	2CH	004	021	And their snuffers, and their lamps [were made], and [he made] the bowls, and the censers, and the fire-pans, of pure gold.
014	2CH	004	022	And [there was] the inner door of the house [opening] into the holy of holies, and [he made] the inner doors of the temple of gold. So all the work which Solomon wrought for the house of the Lord was finished.
014	2CH	005	001	And Solomon brought in the holy things of his father David, the silver, and the gold, and the [other] vessels, and put them in the treasury of the house of the Lord.
014	2CH	005	002	Then Solomon assembled all the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, [even] the leaders of the families of the children of Israel, to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of the city of David, —this [is] Sion.
014	2CH	005	003	And all Israel were assembled [unto] the king in the feast, this [is] the seventh month.
014	2CH	005	004	And all the elders of Israel came; and all the Levites took up the ark,
014	2CH	005	005	and the tabernacle of witness, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle; and the priests and the Levites brought it up.
014	2CH	005	006	And king Solomon, and all the elders of Israel, and the religious of them, and they of them that were gathered before the ark, [were] sacrificing calves and sheep, which could not be numbered or reckoned for multitude.
014	2CH	005	007	And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the Lord into its place, into the oracle of the house, [even] into the holy of holies, under the wings of the cherubs.
014	2CH	005	008	And the cherubs stretched out their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubs covered the ark, and its staves above.
014	2CH	005	009	And the staves projected, and the heads of the staves were seen from the holy place in front of the oracle, they were not seen without: and there they were to this day.
014	2CH	005	010	There was nothing in the ark except the two tables which Moses placed [there] in Choreb, which God gave in covenant with the children of Israel, when they went out of the land of Egypt.
014	2CH	005	011	And it came to pass, when the priests when out of the holy place, (for all the priests that were found were sanctified, they were not [then] arranged according to their daily course,)
014	2CH	005	012	that all the singing Levites [assigned] to the sons of Asaph, to Aeman, to Idithun, and to his sons, and to his brethren, of them that were clothed in linen garments, with cymbals and lutes and harps, [were] standing before the altar, and with them a hundred and twenty priests, blowing trumpets.
014	2CH	005	013	And there was one voice in the trumpeting and in the psalm-singing, and in the loud utterance with one voice to give thanks and praise the Lord; and when they raised their voice together with trumpets and cymbals, and instruments of music, and said, Give thanks to the Lord, for [it is] good, for his mercy [endures] for ever: —then the house was filled with the cloud of the glory of the Lord.
014	2CH	005	014	And the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud: for the glory of the Lord filled the house of God.
014	2CH	006	001	Then said Solomon, The Lord said that he would dwell in thick darkness.
014	2CH	006	002	But I have built a house to thy name, holy to thee, and prepared [for thee] to dwell in for ever.
014	2CH	006	003	And the king turned his face, and blessed all the congregation of Israel: and all the congregation of Israel stood by.
014	2CH	006	004	And he said, Blessed [be] the Lord God of Israel: he has even fulfilled with his hands as he spoke with his mouth to my father David, saying,
014	2CH	006	005	From the day when I brought up my people out of the land of Egypt, I chose no city of all the tribes of Israel, to build a house that my name should be there; neither did I choose a man to be a leader over my people Israel.
014	2CH	006	006	But I chose Jerusalem that my name should be there; and I chose David to be over my people Israel.
014	2CH	006	007	And it came into the heart of David my father, to build a house for the name of the Lord God of Israel.
014	2CH	006	008	But the Lord said to my father David, Whereas it came into thy heart to build a house for my name, thou didst well that it came into thy heart.
014	2CH	006	009	Nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; for thy son who shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house for my name.
014	2CH	006	010	And the Lord has confirmed this word, which he spoke; and I am raised up in the room of my father David, and I sit upon the throne of Israel as the Lord said, and I have built the house for the name of the Lord God of Israel:
014	2CH	006	011	and I have set there the ark in which [is] the covenant of the Lord, which he made with Israel.
014	2CH	006	012	And he stood before the altar of the Lord in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread out his hands.
014	2CH	006	013	For Solomon [had] made a brazen scaffold, and set it in the midst of the court of the sanctuary; the length of it [was] five cubits, and the breadth of it five cubits, and the height of it three cubits: and he stood upon it, and fell upon his knees before the whole congregation of Israel, and spread abroad his hands to heaven,
014	2CH	006	014	and said, Lord God of Israel, there is no God like thee in heaven, or on the earth; keeping covenant and mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with [their] whole heart.
014	2CH	006	015	Even as thou hast kept [them] with thy servant David my father, as thou hast spoken to him in words: —thou hast both spoken with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled [it] with thy hands, as it is this day.
014	2CH	006	016	and now, Lord God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father the things which thou spokest to him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man before me sitting on the throne of Israel, if only thy sons will take heed to their way to walk in my law, as thou didst walk before me.
014	2CH	006	017	And now, Lord God of Israel, let, I pray thee, thy word be confirmed, which thou hast spoken to thy servant David.
014	2CH	006	018	For will God indeed dwell with men upon the earth? if the heaven and the heaven of heavens will not suffice thee, what then is this house which I have built?
014	2CH	006	019	Yet thou shalt have respect to the prayer of thy servant, and to my petition, O Lord God, so as to hearken to the petition and the prayer which thy servant prays before thee this day:
014	2CH	006	020	so that thine eyes should be open over this house by day and by night, towards this place, whereon thou saidst thy name should be called, so as to hear the prayer which thy servant prays towards this house.
014	2CH	006	021	And thou shalt hear the supplication of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, whatsoever prayers they shall make towards this place: and thou shalt hearken in thy dwelling-place out of heaven, yea thou shalt hear, and be merciful.
014	2CH	006	022	If a man sin against his neighbour, and he bring an oath upon him so as to make him swear, and he come and swear before the altar in this house;
014	2CH	006	023	then shalt thou hearken out of heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, to recompense the transgressor, and to return his ways upon his head: and to justify the righteous, to recompense him according to his righteousness.
014	2CH	006	024	And if thy people Israel should be put to the worse before the enemy, if they should sin against thee, and [then] turn and confess to thy name, and pray and make supplication before thee in this house;
014	2CH	006	025	then shalt thou hearken out of heaven and shalt be merciful to the sins of thy people Israel, and thou shalt restore them to the land which thou gavest to them and to their fathers.
014	2CH	006	026	When heaven is restrained, and there is no rain, because they shall have sinned against thee, and [when] they shall pray towards this place, and praise thy name, and shall turn from their sins, because thou shalt afflict them;
014	2CH	006	027	then shalt thou hearken from heaven, and thou shalt be merciful to the sins of thy servants, and of thy people Israel; for thou shalt shew them the good way in which they shall walk; and thou shalt send rain upon thy land, which thou gavest to thy people for an inheritance.
014	2CH	006	028	If there should be famine upon the land, if there should be death, a pestilent wind an blight; if there should be locust and caterpiller, and if the enemy should harass them before their cities: in whatever plague and whatever distress [they may be];
014	2CH	006	029	Then whatever prayer and whatever supplication shall be made by any man and all thy people Israel, if a man should know his own plague and his own sickness, and should spread forth his hands toward this house;
014	2CH	006	030	then shalt thou hear from heaven, out of thy prepared dwelling-place, and shalt be merciful, and shalt recompense to the man according to his ways, as thou shalt know his heart [to be]; for thou alone knowest the heart of the children of men:
014	2CH	006	031	that they may reverence all thy ways all the days which they live upon the face of the land, which thou gavest to our fathers.
014	2CH	006	032	And every stranger who is not himself of thy people Israel, and who shall have come from a distant land because of thy great name, and thy mighty hand, and thy high arm; when they shall come and worship toward this place; —
014	2CH	006	033	then shalt thou hearken out of heaven, out of thy prepared dwelling-place, and shalt do according to all that the stranger shall call upon thee for; that all the nations of the earth may know thy name, and that they may fear thee, as thy people Israel [do], and that they may know that thy name is called upon this house which I have built.
014	2CH	006	034	And if thy people shall go forth to war against their enemies by the way by which thou shalt send them, and shall pray to thee toward this city which thou hast chosen, and [toward] the house which I have built to thy name;
014	2CH	006	035	then shalt thou hear out of heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause.
014	2CH	006	036	Whereas if they shall sin against thee, (for there is no man who will not sin,) and thou shalt smite them, and deliver them up before their enemies, and they that take them captive shall carry them away into a land of enemies, to a land far off or near;
014	2CH	006	037	and [if] they shall repent in their land whither they were carried captive, and shall also turn and make supplication to thee in their captivity, saying, We have sinned, we have transgressed, we have wrought unrighteously;
014	2CH	006	038	and [if] they shall turn to thee with all their heart and all their soul in the land of them that carried them captives, whither they carried them captives, and shall pray toward their land which thou gavest to their fathers, and the city which thou didst choose, and the house which I built to thy name: —
014	2CH	006	039	then shalt thou hear out of heaven, out of thy prepared dwelling-place, their prayer and their supplication, and thou shalt execute justice, and shalt be merciful to thy people that sin against thee.
014	2CH	006	040	And now, Lord, let, I pray thee, thine eyes be opened, and thine ears be attentive to the petition [made in] this place.
014	2CH	006	041	And now, O Lord God, arise into thy resting-place, thou, and the ark of thy strength: let thy priests, O Lord God, clothe themselves with salvation, and thy sons rejoice in prosperity.
014	2CH	006	042	O Lord God, turn not away the face of thine anointed: remember the mercies of thy servant David.
014	2CH	007	001	And when Solomon had finished praying, then the fire came down from heaven, and devoured the whole-burnt-offerings and the sacrifices; and the glory of the Lord filled the house.
014	2CH	007	002	And the priests could not enter into the house of the Lord at that time, for the glory of the Lord filled the house.
014	2CH	007	003	And all the children of Israel saw the fire descending, and the glory of the Lord was upon the house: and they fell upon their face to the ground on the pavement, and worshipped, and praised the Lord; for [it is] good [to do so], because his mercy [endures] for ever.
014	2CH	007	004	And the king and all the people [were] offering sacrifices before the Lord.
014	2CH	007	005	And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of calves twenty and two thousand, of sheep a hundred and twenty thousand: so the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.
014	2CH	007	006	And the priests were standing at their watches, and the Levites with instruments of music of the Lord, belonging to king David, to give thanks before the Lord, for his mercy [endures] for ever, with the hymns of David, by their ministry: and the priests were blowing the trumpets before them, and all Israel standing.
014	2CH	007	007	And Solomon consecrated the middle of the court that was in the house of the Lord: for he offered there the whole-burnt-offerings and the fat of the peace-offerings, for the brazen altar which Solomon had made was not sufficient to receive the whole-burnt-offerings, and the meat-offerings, and the fat.
014	2CH	007	008	And Solomon kept the feast at that time seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great assembly, from the entering in of Aemath, and as far as the river of Egypt.
014	2CH	007	009	And on the eighth day he kept a solemn assembly: for he kept a feast of seven days as the dedication of the altar.
014	2CH	007	010	And on the twenty-third day of the seventh month he dismissed the people to their tents, rejoicing, and with a glad heart because of the good deeds which the Lord had done to David, and to Solomon, and to Israel his people.
014	2CH	007	011	So Solomon finished the house of the Lord, and the king's house: and in whatever Solomon wished in his heart to do in the house of the Lord and in his own house, he prospered.
014	2CH	007	012	And the Lord appeared to Solomon by night, and said to him, I have heard thy prayer, and I have chosen this place to myself for a house of sacrifice.
014	2CH	007	013	If I should restrain the heaven and there should be no rain, and if I should command the locust to devour the trees, and if I should send pestilence upon my people;
014	2CH	007	014	then if my people, on whom my name is called, should repent, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their evil ways, I also will hear from heaven, and I will be merciful to their sins, and I will heal their land.
014	2CH	007	015	And now my eyes shall be open, and my ears attentive to the prayer of this place.
014	2CH	007	016	And now I have chosen and sanctified this house, that my name should be there for ever: and my eyes and my heart shall be there always.
014	2CH	007	017	And if thou wilt walk before me as David thy father [did], and wilt do according to all that I have commanded thee, and wilt keep my ordinances and my judgments;
014	2CH	007	018	then will I establish the throne of thy kingdom, as I covenanted with David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man ruling in Israel.
014	2CH	007	019	But if ye should turn away, and forsake my ordinances and my commandments, which I have set before you, and go and serve other gods, and worship them;
014	2CH	007	020	then will I remove you from the land which I gave them; and this house which I have consecrated to my name I will remove out of my sight, and I will make it a proverb and a by-word among all nations.
014	2CH	007	021	And [as for] this lofty house, every one that passes by it shall be amazed, and shall say, Wherefore has the Lord done [thus] to this land, and to this house?
014	2CH	007	022	And [men] shall say, Because they forsook the Lord God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and they attached themselves to other gods, and worshipped them, and served them: and therefore he has brought upon them all this evil.
014	2CH	008	001	And it came to pass after twenty years, in which Solomon built the house of the Lord, and his own house,
014	2CH	008	002	that Solomon rebuilt the cities which Chiram had given to Solomon, and caused the children of Israel to dwell in them.
014	2CH	008	003	And Solomon came to Baesoba, and fortified it.
014	2CH	008	004	And he built Thoedmor in the wilderness, and all the strong cities which he built in Emath.
014	2CH	008	005	And he built Baethoron the upper, and Baethoron the lower, strong cities, —they had walls, gates, and bars;
014	2CH	008	006	and Balaath, and all the strong cities which Solomon had, and all his chariot cities, and cities of horsemen, and all things that Solomon desired according to his desire of building, in Jerusalem, and in Libanus, and in all his kingdom.
014	2CH	008	007	[As for] all the people that was left of the Chettites, and the Amorites, and the Pherezites, and the Evites, and the Jebusites, who are not of Israel,
014	2CH	008	008	but were of the children of them whom the children Israel destroyed not, that were left after them in the land, even them did Solomon make tributaries to this day.
014	2CH	008	009	But Solomon did not make any of the children of Israel servants in his kingdom; for, behold, [they were] warriors and rulers, and mighty [men], and captains of chariots and horsemen.
014	2CH	008	010	And these are the chiefs of the officers of king Solomon, two hundred and fifty overseeing the work among the people.
014	2CH	008	011	And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharao from the city of David to the house which he had built for her: for he said, My wife shall not dwell in the city of David, the king of Israel, for [the place] is holy into which the ark of the Lord has entered.
014	2CH	008	012	Then Solomon offered up to the Lord whole-burnt-offerings on the altar which he had built to the Lord before the temple,
014	2CH	008	013	according to the daily rate, to offer up [sacrifices] according to the commandments of Moses, on the sabbaths, and at the new moons, and at the feasts, three times in the year, at the feast of unleavened bread, and at the feast of weeks, and at the feast of tabernacles.
014	2CH	008	014	And he established, according to the order of his father David, the courses of the priests, and [that] according to their public ministrations: and the Levites [were appointed] over their charges, to praise and minister before the priests according to the daily order: and the porters were appointed according to their courses to the different gates: for thus [were] the commandments of David the man of God.
014	2CH	008	015	They transgressed not the commandments of the king concerning the priests and the Levites with regard to everything else, and with regard to the treasures.
014	2CH	008	016	Now all the work had been prepared from the day when the foundation was laid, until Solomon finished the house of the Lord.
014	2CH	008	017	Then Solomon went to Gasion Gaber, and to Aelath near the sea in the land of Idumea.
014	2CH	008	018	And Chiram sent by the hand of his servants ships, and servants skilled in naval affairs; and they went with the servants of Solomon to Sophira, and brought thence four hundred and fifty talents of gold, and they came to king Solomon.
014	2CH	009	001	And the queen of Saba heard [of] the name of Solomon, and she came to Jerusalem with a very large force, to prove Solomon with hard questions, and [she had] camels bearing spices in abundance, and gold, and precious stones: and she came to Solomon, and told him all that was in her mind.
014	2CH	009	002	And Solomon told her all her words; and there passed not a word from Solomon which he told her not.
014	2CH	009	003	And the queen of Saba saw the wisdom of Solomon, and the house which he had built,
014	2CH	009	004	and the meat of the tables, and the sitting of his servants, and the standing of his ministers, and their raiment; and his cupbearers, and their apparel; and the whole-burnt-offerings which he offered up in the house of the Lord; then she was in ecstasy.
014	2CH	009	005	And she said to the king, [It was] a true report which I heard in my land concerning thy words, and concerning thy wisdom.
014	2CH	009	006	Yet I believed not the reports until I came, and my eyes saw: and, behold, the half of the abundance of thy wisdom was not told me: thou hast exceeded the report which I heard.
014	2CH	009	007	Blessed [are] thy men, blessed [are] these thy servants, who stand before thee continually, and hear thy wisdom.
014	2CH	009	008	Blessed be the Lord thy God, who took pleasure in thee, to set thee upon his throne for a king, to the Lord thy God: forasmuch as the Lord thy God loved Israel to establish them for ever, therefore he has set thee over them for a king to execute judgment and justice.
014	2CH	009	009	And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and spices in very great abundance, and precious stones: and there were not [any where else] such spices as those which the queen of Saba gave king Solomon.
014	2CH	009	010	And the servants of Solomon and the servants of Chiram brought gold to Solomon out of Suphir, and pine timber, and precious stones.
014	2CH	009	011	And the king made of the pine timber steps to the house of the Lord, and to the king's house, and harps and lutes for the singers: and such were not seen before in the land of Juda.
014	2CH	009	012	And king Solomon gave to the queen of Saba all that she requested, besides all that she brought to king Solomon: and she returned to her [own] land.
014	2CH	009	013	And the weight of the gold that was brought to Solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold,
014	2CH	009	014	besides what the men who were regularly appointed and the merchants brought, and all the kings of Arabia and princes of the land: all brought gold and silver to king Solomon.
014	2CH	009	015	And king Solomon made two hundred shields of beaten gold: there were six hundred [shekels] of pure gold to one shield.
014	2CH	009	016	And three hundred buckles of beaten gold: [the weight] of three hundred gold shekels went to one buckler: and the king placed them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.
014	2CH	009	017	And the king made a great throne of ivory, and he gilded it with pure gold.
014	2CH	009	018	And [there were] six steps to the throne, riveted with gold, and elbows on either side of the seat of the throne, and two lions standing by the elbows:
014	2CH	009	019	and twelve lions standing there on the six steps on each side. There was not the like in any [other] kingdom.
014	2CH	009	020	And all king Solomon's vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were covered with gold: silver was not thought anything of in the days of Solomon.
014	2CH	009	021	For a ship went for the king to Tharsis with the servants of Chiram: once every three years came vessels from Tharsis to the king, laden with gold, and silver, and ivory, and apes.
014	2CH	009	022	And Solomon exceeded all [other] kings both in riches and wisdom.
014	2CH	009	023	And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.
014	2CH	009	024	And they brought every one his gifts, silver vessels and golden vessels, and raiment, myrrh and spices, horses and mules, a rate every year.
014	2CH	009	025	And Solomon had four thousand mares for chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen; and he put them in the chariot cities, and with the king in Jerusalem.
014	2CH	009	026	And he rules over all the kings from the river even to the land of the Philistines, and to the borders of Egypt.
014	2CH	009	027	And the king made gold and silver in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars as the sycamore trees in the plain for abundance.
014	2CH	009	028	And Solomon imported horses from Egypt, and from every [other] country.
014	2CH	009	029	And the rest of the acts of Solomon, the first and the last, behold, these are written in the words of Nathan the prophet, and in the words of Achia the Selonite, and in the visions of Joel the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nabat.
014	2CH	009	030	And Solomon reigned over all Israel forty years.
014	2CH	009	031	And Solomon fell asleep, and they buried him in the city of David his father: and Roboam his son reigned in his stead.
014	2CH	010	001	And Roboam came to Sychem: for all Israel came to Sychem to make him king.
014	2CH	010	002	And it came to pass when Jeroboam the son of Nabat heard [it], (now he was in Egypt, forasmuch as he had fled thither from the face of king Solomon, and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt,) that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt.
014	2CH	010	003	And they sent and called him: and Jeroboam and all the congregation came to Roboam, saying,
014	2CH	010	004	Thy father made our yoke grievous: now then abate [somewhat] of thy father's grievous rule, and of his heavy yoke which he put upon us, and we will serve thee.
014	2CH	010	005	And he said to them, Go away for three days, and [then] come to me. So the people departed.
014	2CH	010	006	And king Roboam assembled the elders that stood before his father Solomon in his life-time, saying, How do ye counsel [me] to return an answer to this people?
014	2CH	010	007	And they spoke to him, saying, If thou wouldest this day befriend this people, and be kind to them, and speak to them good words, then will they be thy servants for ever.
014	2CH	010	008	But he forsook the advice of the old men, who took counsel with him, and he took counsel with the young men who had been brought up with him, who stood before him.
014	2CH	010	009	And he said to them, What do ye advise that I should answer this people, who spoke to me, saying, Ease [somewhat] of the yoke which thy father laid upon us?
014	2CH	010	010	And the young men that had been brought up with him spoke to him, saying, Thus shalt thou speak to the people that spoke to thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, and do thou lighten [somewhat of it] from us; thus shalt thou say, My little finger [shall be] thicker than my father's loins.
014	2CH	010	011	And whereas my father chastised you with a heavy yoke, I will also add to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, and I will chastise you with scorpions.
014	2CH	010	012	And Jeroboam and all the people came to Roboam on the third day, as the king had spoken, saying, Return to me on the third day.
014	2CH	010	013	And the king answered harshly; and king Roboam forsook the counsel of the old men,
014	2CH	010	014	and spoke to them according to the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to it: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.
014	2CH	010	015	And the king hearkened not to the people, for there was a change [of their minds] from God, saying, The Lord has confirmed his word, which he spoke by the hand of Achia the Selonite concerning Jeroboam the son of Nabat, and [concerning] all Israel;
014	2CH	010	016	for the king did not hearken to them. And the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David, or inheritance in the son of Jessae? to thy tents, O Israel: now see to thine own house, David. So all Israel went to their tents.
014	2CH	010	017	But the men of Israel, even those who dwelt in the cities of Juda, [remained] and made Roboam king over them.
014	2CH	010	018	And king Roboam sent to them Adoniram that was over the tribute; and the children of Israel stoned him with stones, and he died. And king Roboam hasted to mount [his] chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.
014	2CH	010	019	So Israel rebelled against the house of David until this day.
014	2CH	011	001	And Roboam came to Jerusalem; and he assembled Juda and Benjamin, a hundred and eighty thousand young men fit for war, and he waged war with Israel to recover the kingdom to Roboam.
014	2CH	011	002	And the Word of the Lord came to Samaias the man of God, saying,
014	2CH	011	003	Speak to Roboam the [son] of Solomon, and to all Juda and Benjamin, saying,
014	2CH	011	004	Thus saith the Lord, Ye shall not go up, and ye shall not war against your brethren: return every one to his home; for this thing is of me. And they hearkened to the word of the Lord, and returned from going against Jeroboam.
014	2CH	011	005	And Roboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and he built walled cities in Judea.
014	2CH	011	006	And he built Bethleem, and Aetan and Thecoe,
014	2CH	011	007	and Baethsura, and Sochoth, and Odollam,
014	2CH	011	008	and Geth, and Marisa, and Ziph,
014	2CH	011	009	and Adorai, and Lachis, and Azeca,
014	2CH	011	010	and Saraa, and Aelom, and Chebron, which belong to Juda and Benjamin, walled cities.
014	2CH	011	011	And he fortified them with walls, and placed in them captains, and stores of provisions, oil and wine,
014	2CH	011	012	shields and spears in every several city, and he fortified them very strongly, and he had on his side Juda and Benjamin.
014	2CH	011	013	And the priests and the Levites who were in all Israel were gathered to him out of all the coasts.
014	2CH	011	014	For the Levites left the tents of their possession, and went to Juda to Jerusalem, because Jeroboam and his sons had ejected them so that they should not minister to the Lord.
014	2CH	011	015	And he made for himself priests of the high places, and for the idols, and for the vanities, and for the calves which Jeroboam made.
014	2CH	011	016	And he cast out from the tribes of Israel those who set their heart to seek the Lord God of Israel: and they came to Jerusalem, to sacrifice to the Lord God of their fathers.
014	2CH	011	017	And they strengthened the kingdom of Juda; and [Juda] strengthened Roboam the [son] of Solomon for three years, for he walked three years in the ways of David and Solomon.
014	2CH	011	018	And Roboam took to himself for a wife, Moolath daughter of Jerimuth the son of David, and Abigaia daughter of Heliab the son of Jessae.
014	2CH	011	019	And she bore him sons; Jeus, and Samoria, and Zaam.
014	2CH	011	020	And afterwards he took to himself Maacha the daughter of Abessalom; and she bore him Abia, and Jetthi, and Zeza, and Salemoth.
014	2CH	011	021	And Roboam loved Maacha the daughter of Abessalom more than all his wives and all his concubines: for he had eighteen wives and sixty concubines; and he begot twenty-eight sons, and sixty daughters.
014	2CH	011	022	And he made Abia the son of Maacha chief, [even] a leader among his brethren, for he intended to make him king.
014	2CH	011	023	And he was exalted beyond all his [other] sons in all the coasts of Juda and Benjamin, and in the strong cities; and he gave them provisions in great abundance: and he desired many wives.
014	2CH	012	001	And it came to pass when the kingdom of Roboam was established, and when he had grown strong, [that] he forsook the commandments of the Lord, and all Israel with him.
014	2CH	012	002	And it came to pass in the fifth year of the reign of Roboam, Susakim king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had sinned against the Lord,
014	2CH	012	003	with twelve hundred chariots, and sixty thousand horses: and there was no number of the multitude that came with him from Egypt; Libyans, Trogodytes, and Ethiopians.
014	2CH	012	004	And they obtained possession of the strong cities, which were in Juda, and came to Jerusalem.
014	2CH	012	005	And Samaias the prophet came to Roboam, and to the princes of Juda that were gathered to Jerusalem for fear of Susakim, and said to them, Thus said the Lord, Ye have left me, and I will leave you in the hand of Susakim.
014	2CH	012	006	And the elders of Israel and the king were ashamed, and said, The Lord [is] righteous.
014	2CH	012	007	And when the Lord saw that they repented, then came the word of the Lord to Samaias, saying, They have repented; I will not destroy them, but I will set them in safety for a little while, and my wrath shall not be poured out on Jerusalem.
014	2CH	012	008	Nevertheless they shall be servants, and know my service, and the service of the kings of the earth.
014	2CH	012	009	So Susakim king of Egypt went up against Jerusalem, and took the treasures that were in the house of the Lord, and the treasures that were in the king's house: he took all; and he took the golden shields which Solomon had made.
014	2CH	012	010	And king Roboam made brazen shields instead of them. And Susakim set over him captains of footmen, as keepers of the gate of the king.
014	2CH	012	011	And it came to pass, when the king went into the house of the Lord, the guards and the footmen went in, and they that returned to meet the footmen.
014	2CH	012	012	And when he repented, the anger of the Lord turned from him, and did not destroy him utterly; for there were good things in Juda.
014	2CH	012	013	So king Roboam strengthened [himself] in Jerusalem, and reigned: and Roboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, in the city which the Lord chose out of all the tribes of the children of Israel to call his name there: and his mother's name was Noomma the Ammanitess.
014	2CH	012	014	And he did evil, for he directed not his heart to seek the Lord.
014	2CH	012	015	And the acts of Roboam, the first and the last, behold, are they not written in the book of Samaia the prophet, and Addo the seer, with his achievements.
014	2CH	012	016	And Roboam made war with Jeroboam all [his] days. And Roboam died with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David: and Abia his son reigned in his stead.
014	2CH	013	001	In the eighteenth year of the reign of Jeroboam Abia began to reign over Juda.
014	2CH	013	002	He reigned three years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name [was] Maacha, daughter of Uriel of Gabaon. And there was war between Abia and Jeroboam.
014	2CH	013	003	And Abia set the battle in array with an army, with mighty men of war, [even] four hundred thousand mighty men: and Jeroboam set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand, [they were] mighty warriors of the host.
014	2CH	013	004	And Abia rose up from the mount Somoron, which is in mount Ephraim, and said, Hear ye, Jeroboam, and all Israel:
014	2CH	013	005	[Is it] not for you to know that the Lord God of Israel has given a king over Israel for ever to David, and to his sons, by a covenant of salt?
014	2CH	013	006	But Jeroboam the [son] of Nabat, the servant of Solomon [the son] of David, is risen up, and has revolted from his master:
014	2CH	013	007	and there are gathered to him pestilent men, transgressors, and he has risen up against Roboam the [son] of Solomon, while Roboam was young and fearful in heart, and he withstood him not.
014	2CH	013	008	And now ye profess to resist the kingdom of the Lord in the hand of the sons of David; and ye [are] a great multitude, and with you are golden calves, which Jeroboam made you for gods.
014	2CH	013	009	Did ye not cast out the priests of the Lord, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and make to yourselves priests of the people of any [other] land? whoever came to consecrate himself with a calf of the heard and seven rams, he forthwith became a priest to that which is no god.
014	2CH	013	010	But we have not forsaken the Lord our God, and his priests, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, minister to the Lord; and in their daily courses
014	2CH	013	011	they sacrifice to the Lord whole-burnt-offering, morning and evening, and compound incense, and [set] the shewbread on the pure table; and [there is] the golden candlestick, and the lamps for burning, to light in the evening: for we keep the charge of the Lord God of our fathers; but ye have forsaken him.
014	2CH	013	012	And, behold, the Lord and his priests are with us at our head, and the signal trumpets to sound an alarm over us. Children of Israel, fight not against the Lord God of our fathers; for ye shall not prosper.
014	2CH	013	013	Now Jeroboam had caused an ambush to come round upon him from behind: and he [himself] was before Juda, and the ambush behind.
014	2CH	013	014	And Juda looked back, and, behold, the battle [was] against them before and behind: and they cried to the Lord, and the priests sounded with the trumpets.
014	2CH	013	015	And the men of Juda shouted: and it came to pass, when the men of Juda shouted, that the Lord smote Jeroboam and Israel before Abia and Juda.
014	2CH	013	016	And the children of Israel fled from before Juda; and the Lord delivered them into their hands.
014	2CH	013	017	And Abia and his people smote them with a great slaughter: and there fell slain of Israel five hundred thousand mighty men.
014	2CH	013	018	So the children of Israel were brought low in that day, and the children of Juda prevailed, because they trusted on the Lord God of their fathers.
014	2CH	013	019	And Abia pursued after Jeroboam, and he took from him the cities, Baethel and her towns, and Jesyna and her towns, and Ephron and her towns.
014	2CH	013	020	And Jeroboam did not recover strength again all the days of Abia: and the Lord smote him, and he died.
014	2CH	013	021	But Abia strengthened himself, and took to himself fourteen wives, and he begot twenty-two sons, and sixteen daughters.
014	2CH	013	022	And the rest of the acts of Abia, and his deeds, and his sayings, are written in the book of the prophet Addo.
014	2CH	014	001	And Abia died with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David; and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In the days of Asa the land of Juda had rest ten years.
014	2CH	014	002	And he did that which was good and right in the sight of the Lord his God.
014	2CH	014	003	And he removed the altars of the strange [gods], and the high places, and broke the pillars in pieces, and cut down the groves:
014	2CH	014	004	and he told Juda to seek earnestly the Lord God of their fathers, and to perform the law and commandments.
014	2CH	014	005	And he removed from all the cities of Juda the altars and the idols, and established in quietness
014	2CH	014	006	fortified cities in the land of Juda; for the land was quiet, and he had no war in these years; for the Lord gave him rest.
014	2CH	014	007	And he said to Juda, Let us fortify these cities, and make walls, and towers, and gates, and bars: we shall prevail over the land, for as we have sought out the Lord our God, he has sought out us, and has given us rest round about, and prospered us.
014	2CH	014	008	And Asa had a force of armed men bearing shields and spears in the land of Juda, [even] three hundred thousand, and in the land of Benjamin two hundred and eighty thousand targeteers and archers: all these were mighty warriors.
014	2CH	014	009	And Zare the Ethiopian went out against them, with a force of a million, and three hundred chariots; and came to Maresa.
014	2CH	014	010	And Asa went out to meet him, and set the battle in array in the valley north of Maresa.
014	2CH	014	011	And Asa cried to the Lord his God, and said, O Lord, it is not impossible with thee to save by many or by few: strengthen us, O Lord our God; for we trust in thee, and in thy name have we come against this great multitude. O Lord our God, let not man prevail against thee.
014	2CH	014	012	And the Lord smote the Ethiopians before Juda; and the Ethiopians fled.
014	2CH	014	013	And Asa and his people pursued them to Gedor; and the Ethiopians fell, so that they could not recover themselves; for they were crushed before the Lord, and before his host; and they took many spoils.
014	2CH	014	014	And they destroyed their towns roundabout Gedor; for a terror of the Lord was upon them: and they spoiled all their cities, for they had much spoil.
014	2CH	014	015	Also they destroyed the tents of cattle, and the Alimazons, and took many sheep and camels, and returned to Jerusalem.
014	2CH	015	001	And Azarias the son of Oded—upon him came the Spirit of the Lord,
014	2CH	015	002	and he went out to meet Asa, and all Juda and Benjamin, and said, Hear me, Asa, and all Juda and Benjamin. The Lord [is] with you, while ye are with him; and if ye seek him out, he will be found of you; but if ye forsake him, he will forsake you.
014	2CH	015	003	And Israel [has been] a long time without the true God, and without a priest to expound [the truth], and without the law.
014	2CH	015	004	But he shall turn them to the Lord God of Israel, and he will be found of them.
014	2CH	015	005	And in that time there is no peace to one going out, or to one coming in, for the terror of the Lord is upon all that inhabit the lands.
014	2CH	015	006	And nation shall fight against nation, and city against city; for God has confounded them with every [kind of] affliction.
014	2CH	015	007	But be ye strong, and let not your hands be weakened: for there is a reward for your work.
014	2CH	015	008	And when [Asa] heard these words, and the prophesy of Adad the prophet, then he strengthened himself, and cast out the abominations from all the land of Juda and Benjamin, and from the cities which Jeroboam possessed, in mount Ephraim, and he renewed the altar of the Lord, which was before the temple of the Lord.
014	2CH	015	009	And he assembled Juda and Benjamin, and the strangers that dwelt with him, of Ephraim, and of Manasse, and of Symeon: for many of Israel were joined to him, when they saw that the Lord his God was with him.
014	2CH	015	010	And they assembled at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.
014	2CH	015	011	And he sacrificed to the Lord in that day of the spoils which they brought, seven hundred calves and seven thousand sheep.
014	2CH	015	012	And he entered into a covenant that they should seek the Lord God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul.
014	2CH	015	013	And that whoever should not seek the Lord God of Israel, should die, whether young or old, whether man or woman.
014	2CH	015	014	And they swore to the Lord with a loud voice, and with trumpets, and with cornets.
014	2CH	015	015	And all Juda rejoiced concerning the oath: for they swore with all their heart, and they sought him with all their desires; and he was found of them: and the Lord gave them rest round about.
014	2CH	015	016	And he removed Maacha his mother from being priestess to Astarte; and he cut down the idol, and burnt it in the brook of Kedron.
014	2CH	015	017	Nevertheless they removed not the high places: they still existed in Israel: nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.
014	2CH	015	018	And he brought in the holy things of David his father, and the holy things of the house of God, silver, and gold, and vessels.
014	2CH	015	019	And there was no war [waged] with him until the thirty-fifth year of the reign of Asa.
014	2CH	016	001	And in the thirty-eighth year of the reign of Asa, the king of Israel went up against Juda, and built Rama, so as not to allow egress or ingress to Asa king of Juda.
014	2CH	016	002	And Asa took silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of the Lord, and of the king's house, and sent [them] to the son of Ader king of Syria, which dwelt in Damascus, saying,
014	2CH	016	003	Make a covenant between me and thee, and between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent thee gold and silver: come, and turn away from me Baasa king of Israel, and let him depart from me.
014	2CH	016	004	And the son of Ader hearkened to king Asa, and sent the captains of his host against the cities of Israel; and smote Aeon, and Dan, and Abelmain, and all the country round Nephthali.
014	2CH	016	005	And it came to pass when Baasa heard [it] he left off building Rama, and put a stop to his work:
014	2CH	016	006	then king Asa took all Juda, and took the stones of Rama, and its timber, [with] which Baasa [had] built; and he built with them Gabae and Maspha.
014	2CH	016	007	And at that time came Anani the prophet to Asa king of Juda, and said to him, Because thou didst trust on the king of Syria, and didst not trust on the Lord thy God, therefore the army of Syria is escaped out of thy hand.
014	2CH	016	008	Were not the Ethiopians and Libyans a great force, in courage, in horsemen, in great numbers? and did not He deliver them into thy hands, because thou trustedst in the Lord?
014	2CH	016	009	For the eyes of the Lord look upon all the earth, to strengthen every heart that is perfect toward him. In this thou hast done foolishly; henceforth there shall be war with thee.
014	2CH	016	010	And Asa was angry with the prophet, and put him in prison, for he was angry at this: and Asa vexed some of the people at that time.
014	2CH	016	011	And, behold, the acts of Asa, the first and the last, [are] written in the book of the kings of Juda and Israel.
014	2CH	016	012	And Asa was diseased [in] his feet in the thirty-ninth year of his reign, until he was very ill: but in his disease he sought not to the Lord, but to the physicians.
014	2CH	016	013	And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the fortieth year of his reign.
014	2CH	016	014	And they buried him in the sepulchre which he had dug for himself in the city of David, and they laid him on a bed, and filled [it] with spices and [all] kinds of perfumes of the apothecaries; and they made for him a very great funeral.
014	2CH	017	001	And Josaphat his son reigned in his stead, Josaphat strengthened himself against Israel.
014	2CH	017	002	And he put garrisons in all the strong cities of Juda, and appointed captains in all the cities of Juda, and in the cities of Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken.
014	2CH	017	003	And the Lord was with Josaphat, for he walked in the first ways of his father, and did not seek to idols;
014	2CH	017	004	but he sought to the Lord God of his father, and walked in the commandments of his father, and not according to the works of Israel.
014	2CH	017	005	And the Lord prospered the kingdom in his hand; and all Juda gave gifts to Josaphat; and he had great wealth and glory.
014	2CH	017	006	And his heart was exalted in the way of the Lord; and he removed the high places and the groves from the land of Juda.
014	2CH	017	007	And in the third year of his reign, he sent his chief men, and his mighty men, Abdias and Zacharias, and Nathanael, and Michaias, to teach in the cities of Juda.
014	2CH	017	008	And with them [were] the Levites, Samaias, and Nathanias, and Zabdias, and Asiel, and Semiramoth, and Jonathan, and Adonias, and Tobias, and Tobadonias, Levites, and with them Elisama and Joram, the priests.
014	2CH	017	009	And they taught in Juda, and [there was] with them the book of the law of the Lord, and they passed through the cities of Juda, and taught the people.
014	2CH	017	010	And a terror of the Lord was upon all the kingdoms of the land round about Juda, and they made no war against Josaphat.
014	2CH	017	011	And [some] of the Philistines brought to Josaphat gifts, and silver, and presents; and the Arabians brought him seven thousand seven hundred rams.
014	2CH	017	012	And Josaphat increased in greatness exceedingly, and built in Judea places of abode, and strong cities.
014	2CH	017	013	And he had many works in Judea: and the mighty men of war, [the men] of strength, [were] in Jerusalem.
014	2CH	017	014	And this [is] their number according to the houses of their fathers; even the captains of thousands in Juda [were], Ednas the chief, and with him mighty men of strength three hundred thousand.
014	2CH	017	015	And after him, Joanan the captain, and with him two hundred eighty thousand.
014	2CH	017	016	And after him Amasias the [son] of Zari, who was zealous for the Lord; and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of strength.
014	2CH	017	017	And out of Benjamin [there was] a mighty man of strength, even Eliada, and with him two hundred thousand archers and targeteers.
014	2CH	017	018	And after him Jozabad, and with him a hundred and eighty thousand mighty men of war.
014	2CH	017	019	These were the king's servants besides those whom the king put in the strong cities in all Judea.
014	2CH	018	001	And Josaphat had yet great wealth and glory, and he connected himself by marriage with the house of Achaab.
014	2CH	018	002	And he went down after a term of years to Achaab to Samaria: and Achaab slew for him sheep and calves, in abundance, and for the people with him, and he much desired him to go up with him to Ramoth of the country of Galaad.
014	2CH	018	003	And Achaab king of Israel said to Josaphat king of Juda, Wilt thou go with me to Ramoth of the country of Galaad? And he said to him, As I [am], so also [art] thou, as thy people, [so] also [is] my people with thee for the war.
014	2CH	018	004	And Josaphat said to the king of Israel, Seek, I pray thee, the Lord to-day.
014	2CH	018	005	And the king of Israel gathered the prophets, four hundred men, and said to them, Shall I go to Ramoth Galaad to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up, and God shall deliver [it] into the hands of the king.
014	2CH	018	006	And Josaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the Lord besides, that we may enquire of him?
014	2CH	018	007	And the king of Israel said to Josaphat, There is yet one man by whom to enquire of the Lord; but I hate him, for he does not prophesy concerning me for good, for all his days [are] for evil: this [is] Michaias the son of Jembla. And Josaphat said, Let not the king say so.
014	2CH	018	008	And the king called an eunuch, and said, [Fetch] quickly Michaias the son of Jembla.
014	2CH	018	009	And the king of Israel and Josaphat king of Juda were sitting each on his throne, and clothed in their robes, sitting in the open space at the entrance of the gate of Samaria: and all the prophets were prophesying before them.
014	2CH	018	010	And Sedekias son of Chanaan made for himself iron horns, and said, Thus saith the Lord, With these thou shalt thrust Syria until it be consumed.
014	2CH	018	011	And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth Galaad, and thou shalt prosper; and the Lord shall deliver it into the hands of the king.
014	2CH	018	012	And the messenger that went to call Michaias spoke to him, saying, Behold, the prophets have spoken favourably concerning the king with one mouth; let now, I pray thee, thy words be as [the words] of one of them, and do thou speak good things.
014	2CH	018	013	And Michaias said, [As] the Lord lives, whatever God shall say to me, that will I speak.
014	2CH	018	014	And he came to the king, and the king said to him, Michaias, shall I go up to Ramoth Galaad to battle, or shall I forbear? And he said, Go up, and thou shalt prosper, and they shall be given into your hands.
014	2CH	018	015	And the king said to him, How often shall I solemnly charge thee that thou speak to me nothing but truth in the name of the Lord?
014	2CH	018	016	And he said, I saw Israel scattered on the mountains, as sheep without a shepherd: and the Lord said, These have no commander; let each return to his home in peace.
014	2CH	018	017	And the king of Israel said to Josaphat, Said I not to thee, that he would not prophesy concerning me good, but evil?
014	2CH	018	018	But he said, Not so. Hear ye the word of the Lord: I saw the Lord sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven stood by on his right hand and on his left.
014	2CH	018	019	And the Lord said, Who will deceive Achaab king of Israel, that he may go up, and fall in Ramoth Galaad? And one spoke this way, and another spoke that way.
014	2CH	018	020	And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the Lord, and said, I will deceive him. And the Lord said, Whereby?
014	2CH	018	021	And he said, I will go forth, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And [the Lord] said, Thou shalt deceive [him], and shalt prevail: go forth, and do so.
014	2CH	018	022	And now, behold, the Lord has put a false spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets, and the Lord has spoken evil against thee.
014	2CH	018	023	Then Sedekias the son of Chanaan drew near, and smote Michaias on the cheek, and said to him, By what way passed the Spirit of the Lord from me to speak to thee?
014	2CH	018	024	And Michaias said, Behold, thou shalt see in that day, when thou shalt go from chamber to chamber to hide thyself.
014	2CH	018	025	And the king of Israel said, Take Michaias, and carry him back to Emer the governor of the city, and to Joas the captain, the king's son;
014	2CH	018	026	and ye shall say, Thus said the king, Put this fellow into the prison house, and let him eat the bread of affliction, and [drink] the water of affliction, until I return in peace.
014	2CH	018	027	And Michaias said, If thou do at all return in peace, the Lord has not spoken by me. And he said, Hear, all ye people.
014	2CH	018	028	So the king of Israel, and Josaphat king of Juda, went up to Ramoth Galaad.
014	2CH	018	029	And the king of Israel said to Josaphat, Disguise me, and I will enter into the battle: and do thou put on my raiment. so the king of Israel disguised himself, and entered into the battle.
014	2CH	018	030	Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots that were with him, saying, Fight neither against small nor great, but only against the king of Israel.
014	2CH	018	031	And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Josaphat, that they said, It is the king of Israel: and they compassed him about to fight against him: and Josaphat cried out, and the Lord delivered him; and God turned them away from him.
014	2CH	018	032	And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned away from him.
014	2CH	018	033	And a man drew a bow with a good aim, and smote the king of Israel between the lungs and the breast-plate: and he said to the charioteer, Turn thine hand, drive me out of the battle, for I am wounded.
014	2CH	018	034	And the battle turned in that day; and the king of Israel remained on the chariot against Syria until evening, and died at sunset.
014	2CH	019	001	And Josaphat king of Juda returned to his house at Jerusalem.
014	2CH	019	002	And there went out to meet him Jeu the prophet the son of Anani, and said to him, King Josaphat, doest thou help a sinner, or act friendly towards one hated of the Lord? Therefore has wrath come upon thee from the Lord.
014	2CH	019	003	Nevertheless [some] good things have been found in thee, forasmuch as thou didst remove the groves from the land of Juda, and didst direct thine heart to seek after the Lord.
014	2CH	019	004	And Josaphat dwelt in Jerusalem: and he again went out among the people from Bersabee to the mount of Ephraim, and turned them back to the Lord God of their fathers.
014	2CH	019	005	And he appointed judges in all the strong cities of Juda, city by city.
014	2CH	019	006	And he said to the judges, Take good heed what ye do: for ye judge not for man, but for the Lord, and with you are matters of judgment.
014	2CH	019	007	And now let the fear of the Lord be upon you, and be wary, and do [your duty]: for there is no unrighteousness with the Lord our God, neither [is it for him] to respect persons, nor take bribes.
014	2CH	019	008	Moreover Josaphat appointed in Jerusalem some of the priests, and Levites, and heads of houses of Israel, for the judgment of the Lord, and to judge the dwellers in Jerusalem.
014	2CH	019	009	And he charged them, saying, Thus shall ye do in the fear of the Lord, in truth and with a perfect heart.
014	2CH	019	010	Whatsoever man of your brethren that dwell in their cities [shall bring] the cause that comes before you, between blood [and] blood, and between precept and commandment, and ordinances and judgments, ye shall even decide for them; so they shall not sin against the Lord, and there shall not be wrath upon you, and upon your brethren: thus ye shall do, and ye shall not sin.
014	2CH	019	011	And, behold, Amarias the priest is head over you in every matter of the Lord; and Zabdias the son of Ismael is head over the house of Juda in every matter of the king; and the scribes and Levites are before you: be strong and active, and the Lord shall be with the good.
014	2CH	020	001	And after this came the children of Moab, and the children of Ammon, and with them [some] of the Minaeans, against Josaphat to battle.
014	2CH	020	002	And they came and told Josaphat, saying, There is come against thee a great multitude from Syria, from beyond the sea; and, behold, they are in Asasan Thamar, this is Engadi.
014	2CH	020	003	And Josaphat was alarmed, and set his face to seek the Lord earnestly, and he proclaimed a fast in all Juda.
014	2CH	020	004	And Juda gathered themselves together to seek after the Lord: even from all the cities of Juda they came to seek the Lord.
014	2CH	020	005	And Josaphat stood up in the assembly of Juda in Jerusalem, in the house of the Lord, in front of the new court.
014	2CH	020	006	And he said, O Lord God of my fathers, art not thou God in heaven above, and art not thou Lord of all the kingdoms of the nations? and [is there] not in thy hand the might of dominion, and there is no one who can resist thee?
014	2CH	020	007	Art not thou the Lord that didst destroy the inhabitants of this land before the face of thy people Israel, and didst give it to thy beloved seed of Abraham for ever?
014	2CH	020	008	And they dwelt in it, and built in it a sanctuary to thy name, saying,
014	2CH	020	009	If there should come upon us evils, sword, judgment, pestilence, famine, we will stand before this house, and before thee, (for thy name [is] upon this house,) and we will cry to thee because of the affliction, and thou shalt hear, and deliver.
014	2CH	020	010	And now, behold, the children of Ammon, and Moab, and mount Seir, with regard to whom thou didst not permit Israel to pass through their border, when they had come out of the land of Egypt, (for they turned away from them, and did not destroy them;)—
014	2CH	020	011	yet now, behold, they make attempts against us, to come forth to cast us out from our inheritance which thou gavest us.
014	2CH	020	012	O Lord our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no strength to resist this great multitude that is come against us; and we know not what we shall do to them: but our eyes are toward thee.
014	2CH	020	013	And all Juda was standing before the Lord, and their children, and their wives.
014	2CH	020	014	And Oziel the [son] of Zacharias, of the children of Banaias, of the sons of Eleiel, the sons of Matthanias the Levite, of the sons of Asaph, —upon him came the Spirit of the Lord in the assembly:
014	2CH	020	015	and he said, Hear ye, all Juda, and the dwellers in Jerusalem, and king Josaphat: Thus saith the Lord to you, even you, Fear not, neither be alarmed, before all this great multitude; for the battle is not years, but God's.
014	2CH	020	016	To-morrow go ye down against them: behold, they come up by the ascent of Assis, and ye shall find them at the extremity of the river of the wilderness of Jeriel.
014	2CH	020	017	It is not for you to fight: understand these things, and see the deliverance of the Lord with you, Juda and Jerusalem: fear not, neither be afraid to go forth to-morrow to meet them; and the Lord shall be with you.
014	2CH	020	018	And Josaphat bowed with his face [to the ground] with all Juda and the dwellers in Jerusalem, [and] they fell before the Lord to worship the Lord.
014	2CH	020	019	And the Levites of the children of Caath, and [they] of the sons of Core, rose up to praise the Lord God of Israel with a loud voice on high.
014	2CH	020	020	And they rose early in the morning and went out to the wilderness of Thecoe: and as they went out, Josaphat stood and cried, and said, Hear me, Juda, and the dwellers in Jerusalem; put your trust in the Lord God, and your trust shall be honored; trust in his prophet, and ye shall prosper.
014	2CH	020	021	And he took counsel with the people, and set appointed men to sing psalms and praises, to give thanks, and sing the holy songs of praise in going forth before the host: and they said, Give thanks to the Lord, for his mercy [endures] for ever.
014	2CH	020	022	And when they began the praise and thanksgiving, the Lord caused the children of Ammon to fight against Moab, and [the inhabitants of] mount Seir that came out against Juda; and they were routed.
014	2CH	020	023	Then the children of Ammon and Moab rose up against the dwellers in mount Seir, to destroy and consume them; and when they had made an end of [destroying] the inhabitants of Seir, they rose up against one another so that they were utterly destroyed.
014	2CH	020	024	And Juda came to the watch-tower of the wilderness, and looked, and saw the multitude, and, behold, [they were] all fallen dead upon the earth, not one escaped.
014	2CH	020	025	And Josaphat and his people went out to spoil them, and they found much cattle, and furniture, and spoils, and precious things: and they spoiled them, and they were three days gathering the spoil, for it was abundant.
014	2CH	020	026	And it came to pass on the fourth day they were gathered to the Valley of Blessing; for there they blessed the Lord: therefore they called the name of the place the Valley of Blessing, until this day.
014	2CH	020	027	And all the men of Juda returned to Jerusalem, and Josaphat led them with great joy; for the Lord gave them joy over their enemies.
014	2CH	020	028	And they entered into Jerusalem with lutes and harps and trumpets, [going] into the house of the lord.
014	2CH	020	029	And there was a terror of the Lord upon all the kingdoms of the land, when they heard that the Lord fought against the enemies of Israel.
014	2CH	020	030	And the kingdom of Josaphat was at peace; and his God gave him rest round about.
014	2CH	020	031	And Josaphat reigned over Juda, being thirty-five years [old] when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Azuba, daughter of Sali.
014	2CH	020	032	And he walked in the ways of his father Asa, and turned not aside from doing that which was right in the sight of the Lord.
014	2CH	020	033	nevertheless the high places yet remained; and as yet the people did not direct their heart to the Lord God of their fathers.
014	2CH	020	034	And the rest of the acts of Josaphat, the first and the last, behold, they are written in the history of Jeu [the son] of Anani, who wrote the book of the kings of Israel.
014	2CH	020	035	And afterwards Josaphat king of Juda entered into an alliance with Ochozias king of Israel, (now this was an unrighteous man,)
014	2CH	020	036	by acting [with] and going to him, to build ships to go to Tharsis: and he built ships in Gasion Gaber.
014	2CH	020	037	And Eliezer thee [son] of Dodia of Marisa prophesied against Josaphat, saying, Forasmuch as thou hast allied thyself with Ochozias, the Lord has broken thy work, and thy vessels have been wrecked. And they could not go to Tharsis.
014	2CH	021	001	And Josaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David: and Joran his son reigned in his stead.
014	2CH	021	002	And he had brothers, the six sons of Josaphat, Azarias, and Jeiel, and Zacharias, and Azarias, and Michael, and Zaphatias: all these [were] the sons of Josaphat king of Juda.
014	2CH	021	003	And their father gave them many gifts, silver, and gold, and arms, together with fortified cities in Juda: but he gave the kingdom to Joram, for he [was] the first-born.
014	2CH	021	004	And Joram entered upon his kingdom, and strengthened himself, and slew all his brothers with the sword, and [some] of the princes of Israel.
014	2CH	021	005	When he was thirty and two years old, Joram succeeded to his kingdom, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.
014	2CH	021	006	And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Achaab; for a daughter of Achaab was his wife: and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord:
014	2CH	021	007	nevertheless the Lord would not utterly destroy the house of David, because of the covenant which he made with David, and as he said to him that he would give a light to him and his sons for ever.
014	2CH	021	008	In those days Edom revolted from Juda, and they made a king over themselves.
014	2CH	021	009	And Joram went with the princes, and all the cavalry with him: and it came to pass that he arose by night, and smote Edom that compassed him about, and the captains of the chariots, and the people fled to their tents.
014	2CH	021	010	And Edom revolted from Juda until this day. Then Lomna at that time revolted from [under] his hand, because he forsook the Lord God of his fathers.
014	2CH	021	011	For he built high places in the cities of Juda, and caused the dwellers in Jerusalem to go a-whoring, and led Juda astray.
014	2CH	021	012	And there came to him [a message] in writing from Eliu the prophet, saying, Thus saith the Lord God of thy father David, Because thou hast not walked in the way of thy father Josaphat, nor in the ways of Asa king of Juda,
014	2CH	021	013	but hast walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and hast caused Juda and the dwellers in Jerusalem to go a-whoring, as the house of Achaab caused [Israel] to go a-whoring, and thou hast slain thy brethren, the sons of thy father, who were better than thyself;
014	2CH	021	014	behold, the Lord shall smite thee with a great plague among thy people, and thy sons, and thy wives, and all thy store:
014	2CH	021	015	and thou [shalt be afflicted] with a grievous disease, with a disease of the bowels, until thy bowels shall fall out day by day with the sickness.
014	2CH	021	016	So the Lord stirred up the Philistines against Joram, and the Arabians, and those who bordered on the Aethiopians:
014	2CH	021	017	and they went up against Juda, and prevailed against them, and took away all the store which they found in the house of the king, and his sons, and his daughters; and there was no son left to him but Ochozias the youngest of his sons.
014	2CH	021	018	And after all these things the Lord smote him in the bowels with an incurable disease.
014	2CH	021	019	And it continued from day to day: and when the time of the days came [to] two years, his bowels fell out with the disease, and he died by a grievous distemper: and his people performed no funeral, like the funeral of his fathers.
014	2CH	021	020	He was thirty and two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem. And he departed without honour, and was buried in the city of David, but not in the tombs of the kings.
014	2CH	022	001	And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ochozias his youngest son king in his stead: for the band of robbers that came against them, even the Arabians and the Alimazonians, had slain all the elder ones. So Ochozias son of Joram king of Juda reigned.
014	2CH	022	002	Ochozias began to reign when he was twenty years old, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Gotholia, the daughter of Ambri.
014	2CH	022	003	And he walked in the way of the house of Achaab; for his mother was his counsellor to do evil.
014	2CH	022	004	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord as the house of Achaab [had done]: for they were his counselors after the death of his father to his destruction.
014	2CH	022	005	And he walked in their counsels, and he went with Joram son of Achaab king of Israel to war against Azael king of Syria to Ramoth Galaad: and the archers smote Joram.
014	2CH	022	006	And Joram returned to Jezrael to be healed of the wounds wherewith the Syrians smote him in Ramoth, when he fought against Azael king of Syria. And Ochozias son of Joram, king of Juda, went down to see Joram the son of Achaab at Jezrael because he was sick.
014	2CH	022	007	And destruction from God came upon Ochozias in [his] coming to Joram; for when he had come, Joram went out with him against Jeu the son of Namessei, the anointed of the Lord against the house of Achaab.
014	2CH	022	008	And it came to pass, when Jeu was taking vengeance on the house of Achaab, that he found the princes of Juda and the brethren of Ochozias ministering to Ochozias, and he slew them.
014	2CH	022	009	And he gave orders to seek Ochozias: and they took him while he was healing his wounds in Samaria, and they brought him to Jeu, and he slew him; and they buried him, for they said, He is the son of Josaphat, who sought the Lord with all his heart. So there was none in the house of Ochozias to secure their power in the kingdom.
014	2CH	022	010	And Gotholia the mother of Ochozias saw that her son was dead, and she arose and destroyed all the seed royal in the house of Juda.
014	2CH	022	011	But Josabeeth, the daughter of the king, took Joas the son of Ochozias and rescued him secretly out of the midst of the sons of the king that were put to death, and she placed him and his nurse in a bedchamber. So Josabeeth daughter of king Joram, sister of Ochozias, wife of Jodae the priest, hid him, and she [even] hid him from Gotholia, and she did not slay him.
014	2CH	022	012	And he was with him hid in the house of God six years; and Gotholia reigned over the land.
014	2CH	023	001	And in the eighth year Jodae strengthened [himself], and took the captains of hundreds, Azarias the son of Joram, and Ismael the son of Joanan, and Azarias the son of Obed, and Maasaeas the son of Adia, and Elisaphan the son of Zacharias, with him unto the house of the Lord.
014	2CH	023	002	And they went round about Juda, and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Juda, and heads of the families of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem.
014	2CH	023	003	and all the congregation of Juda made a covenant with the king in the house of God. And he shewed them the king's son, and said to them, Lo, let the king's son reign, as the Lord said concerning the house of David.
014	2CH	023	004	Now this [is] the thing which ye shall do. Let a third part of you, [even] of the priests and of the Levites, enter in on the sabbath, even into the gates of the entrances;
014	2CH	023	005	and let a third part be in the house of the king; and another third at the middle gate: and all the people in the courts of the Lord's house.
014	2CH	023	006	And let not [any one] enter into the house of the Lord, except the priests and the Levites, and the servants of the Levites; they shall enter in, because they are holy: and let all the people keep the watch of the Lord.
014	2CH	023	007	And the Levites shall compass the king round about, every man's weapon in his hand; and whoever [else] goes into the house shall die: but they shall be with the king when he goes out, and when he comes in.
014	2CH	023	008	And the Levites and all Juda did according to all that the priest Jodae commanded them, and they took each his men from the beginning of the sabbath to the end of the sabbath, for Jodae the priest did not dismiss the courses.
014	2CH	023	009	And Jodae gave to the men the swords, and the shields, and the arms, which [had] belonged to King David, in the house of God.
014	2CH	023	010	And he set the whole people, every man with his arms, from the right side of the house to the left side of the altar and the house, over against the king round about.
014	2CH	023	011	And he brought out the king's son, and put on him the crown and the testimony, and Jodae the priest and his sons proclaimed him king, and anointed him, and said, Long live the king!
014	2CH	023	012	And Gotholia heard the sound of the people running, and acknowledging and praising the king: and she went in to the king into the house of the Lord.
014	2CH	023	013	And she looked, and, behold, the king [stood] in his place, and the princes and trumpets were at the entrance, and the princes were round the king: and all the people of the land rejoiced, and sounded the trumpets, and there were the singers singing with instruments, and singing hymns of praise. and Gotholia rent her robe, and cried, ye surely are plotting against [me].
014	2CH	023	014	And Jodae the priest went forth, and Jodae the priest charged the captains of hundreds, even the captains of the host, and said to them, Thrust her forth outside the house, and follow her, and let her be slain with the sword. For the priest said, Let her not be slain in the house of the Lord.
014	2CH	023	015	So they let her go [out]; and she went through the horsemen's gate of the house of the king, and they slew her there.
014	2CH	023	016	And Jodae made a covenant between himself, and the people, and the king, that the people should be the Lord's.
014	2CH	023	017	And all the people of the land went into the house of Baal, and tore down it and its altars, and they ground his images to powder, and they slew Matthan the priest of Baal before his altars.
014	2CH	023	018	And Jodae the priest committed the works of the house of the Lord into the and of the priests and Levites, and he re-established the courses of the priests and Levites which David appointed over the house of the Lord, and [he appointed them] to offer whole-burnt-offerings to the Lord, as it is written in the law of Moses, with gladness, and with songs by the hand of David.
014	2CH	023	019	And the porters stood at the gates of the house of the Lord, that no one unclean in any respect should enter in.
014	2CH	023	020	And he took the heads of families, and the mighty men, and the chiefs of the people, and all the people of the land, and they conducted the king into the house of the Lord; and he went through the inner gate into the king's house, and they seated the king on the throne of the kingdom.
014	2CH	023	021	And all the people of the land rejoiced; and the city was quiet: and they slew Gotholia.
014	2CH	024	001	Joas was seven years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Sabia of Bersabee.
014	2CH	024	002	And Joas did that which right in the sight of the Lord all the days of Jodae the priest.
014	2CH	024	003	And Jodae took to himself two wives, and they bore sons and daughters.
014	2CH	024	004	And it came to pass afterward that it came into the heart of Joas to repair the house of the Lord.
014	2CH	024	005	And he gathered the priests and the Levites, and said to them, Go out into the cities of Juda, and collect money of all Israel to repair the house of the Lord from year to year, and make haste to speak [of it]. But the Levites hasted not.
014	2CH	024	006	And king Joas called Jodae the chief, and said to him, Why hast thou not looked after the Levites, so that they should bring from Juda and Jerusalem that which was prescribed by Moses the man of God, when he assembled Israel at the tabernacle of witness?
014	2CH	024	007	For Gotholia was a transgressor, and her sons tore down the house of God; for they offered the holy things of the house of the Lord to Baalim.
014	2CH	024	008	And the king said, Let a box be made, and let it be put at the gate of the house of the Lord without.
014	2CH	024	009	And let [men] proclaim in Juda an in Jerusalem, that [the people] should bring to the Lord, as Moses the servant of God spoke concerning Israel in the wilderness.
014	2CH	024	010	And all the princes and all the people gave, and brought in, and cast into the box until it was filled.
014	2CH	024	011	And it came to pass, when they brought in the box to the officers of the king by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that the money was more than sufficient, then came the king's scribe, and the officer of the high priest, and emptied the box, and restored it to its place. Thus they did day by day, and collected much money.
014	2CH	024	012	And the king and Jodae the priest gave it to the workmen employed in the service of the house of the Lord, and they hired masons and carpenters to repair the house of the Lord, also smiths and braziers to repair the house of the Lord.
014	2CH	024	013	And the workmen wrought, and the works prospered in their hands, and they established the house of the Lord on its foundation, and strengthened [it].
014	2CH	024	014	And when they had finished [it], they brought to the king and to Jodae the remainder of the money, and they made vessels for the house of the Lord, vessels of service for whole-burnt-offerings, and gold and silver [censers]: and they offered up whole-burnt-offerings in the house of the Lord continually all the days of Jodae.
014	2CH	024	015	And Jodae grew old, being full of days, and he died, being a hundred and thirty years old at his death.
014	2CH	024	016	And they buried him with the kings in the city of David, because he had dealt well with Israel, and with God and his house.
014	2CH	024	017	And it came to pass after the death of Jodae, [that] the princes of Juda went in, and did obeisance to the king. Then the king hearkened to them.
014	2CH	024	018	And they forsook the house of the Lord God of their fathers, and served the Astartes and idols: and there was wrath upon Juda and Jerusalem in that day.
014	2CH	024	019	yet he sent prophets to them, to turn them to the Lord; but they hearkened not: and he testified to them, but they obeyed not.
014	2CH	024	020	And the Spirit of God came upon Azarias the son of Jodae the priest, and he stood up above the people, and said, Thus saith the Lord, Why do ye transgress the commandments of the Lord? so shall ye not prosper; for ye have forsaken the Lord, and he will forsake you.
014	2CH	024	021	And they conspired against him, and stone him by command of king Joas in the court of the Lord's house.
014	2CH	024	022	So Joas remembered not the kindness which his father Jodae had exercised towards him, but slew his son. And as he died, he said, The Lord look upon [it], and judge.
014	2CH	024	023	And it came to pass after the end of the year, [that] the host of Syria went up against him, and came against Juda and Jerusalem: and they slew all the chiefs of the people among the people, and all their spoils they sent to the king of Damascus.
014	2CH	024	024	For the army of Syria came with few men, yet God gave into their hands a very large army, because they had forsaken the God of their fathers; and he brought judgments on Joas.
014	2CH	024	025	And after they had departed from him, when they had left him in sore diseases, then his servants conspired against him because of the blood of the son of Jodae the priest, and slew him on his bed, and he died, and they buried him in the city of David, but they buried him not in the sepulchre of the kings.
014	2CH	024	026	And they that conspired against him were Zabed the son of Samaath the Ammanite, and Jozabed the son of Samareth the Moabite.
014	2CH	024	027	And all his sons, and the five came to him: and the other [matters], behold, they are written in the book of the kings. And Amasias his son reigned in his stead.
014	2CH	025	001	Amasias began to reign when he was twenty and five years old, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name [was] Joadaen of Jerusalem.
014	2CH	025	002	And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, but not with a perfect heart.
014	2CH	025	003	And it came to pass, when the kingdom was established in his hand, that he slew his servants who had slain the king his father.
014	2CH	025	004	But he slew not their sons, according to the covenant of the law of the Lord, as it is written, [and] as the Lord commanded, saying, The fathers shall not die for the children, and the sons shall not die for the fathers, but they shall die each for his own sin.
014	2CH	025	005	And Amasias assembled the house of Juda, and appointed them according to the houses of their families for captains of thousands and captains of hundreds in all Juda and Jerusalem: and he numbered them from twenty years old and upwards, and found them three hundred thousand able to go out to war, holding spear and shield.
014	2CH	025	006	Also he hired of Israel a hundred thousand mighty [men for] a hundred talents of silver.
014	2CH	025	007	And there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not the host of Israel go with thee; for the Lord is not with Israel, [even] all the sons of Ephraim.
014	2CH	025	008	For if thou shalt undertake to strengthen [thyself] with these, then the lord shall put thee to flight before the enemies: for it is of the Lord both to strengthen and to put to flight.
014	2CH	025	009	And Amasias said to the man of God, But what shall I do [for] the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel? And the man of God said, The Lord can give thee much more than these.
014	2CH	025	010	And Amasias separated from the army that came to him from Ephraim, that they might go away to their place; and they were very angry with Juda, and they returned to their place with great wrath.
014	2CH	025	011	And Amasias strengthened [himself], and took his people, and went to the valley of salt, and smote there the children of Seir ten thousand.
014	2CH	025	012	And the children of Juda took ten thousand prisoners, and they carried them to the top of the precipice, and cast them headlong from the top of the precipice, and they were all dashed to pieces.
014	2CH	025	013	And the men of the host whom Amasias sent back so that they should not go with him to battle, [went] and attacked the cities of Juda, from Samaria to Baethoron; and they smote three thousand among them, and took much spoil.
014	2CH	025	014	And it came to pass, after Amasias had returned from smiting Idumea, that he brought home the gods of the children of Seir, and set them up for himself as gods, and bowed down before them, and he sacrificed to them.
014	2CH	025	015	And the anger of the Lord came upon Amasias, and he sent him a prophet, and he said to him, Why hast thou sought the gods of the people, which have not rescued their own people out of thine hand?
014	2CH	025	016	And it came to pass when the prophet was speaking to him, that he said to him, have I made thee king's counsellor? take heed lest thou be scourged: and the prophet forebore, and said, I know that [God] is disposed against thee to destroy thee, because thou hast done this thing, and hast not hearkened to my counsel.
014	2CH	025	017	And Amasias king of Juda took counsel, and sent to Joas, son of Joachaz, son of Jeu, king of Israel, saying, Come, and let us look one another in the face.
014	2CH	025	018	And Joas king of Israel sent to Amasias king of Juda, saying, The thistle that was in Libanus sent to the cedar that was in Libanus, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife; but, behold, thy wild beasts of the field that are in Libanus shall come: and the wild beasts did come, and trod down the thistle.
014	2CH	025	019	Thou hast said, Behold, I have smitten Idumea, and thy stout heart exalts thee: now stay at home; for why dost thou implicate thyself in mischief, that thou shouldest fall, and Juda with thee.
014	2CH	025	020	Nevertheless Amasias hearkened not, for it was of the Lord to deliver him into [the enemy's] hands, because he sought after the gods of the Idumeans.
014	2CH	025	021	So Joas king of Israel went up; and they saw one another, he and Amasias king of Juda, in Baethsamys, which is of Juda.
014	2CH	025	022	And Juda was put to flight before Israel, and they fled every man to his tent.
014	2CH	025	023	And Joas king of Israel took prisoner Amasias king of Juda, [son] of Joas, son of Joachaz, in Baethsamys, and brought him to Jerusalem; and he pulled down [part] of the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.
014	2CH	025	024	And [he took] all the gold and the silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of the Lord and with Abdedom, and the treasures of the king's house, and the hostages, and he returned to Samaria.
014	2CH	025	025	And Amasias the [son] of Joas king of Juda lived after the death of Joas the [son] of Joachaz king of Israel fifteen years.
014	2CH	025	026	And the rest of the acts of Amasias, the first and the last, Lo! are they not written in the book of the kings of Juda and Israel?
014	2CH	025	027	And at the time when Amasias departed from the Lord, then they formed a conspiracy against him; and he fled from Jerusalem to Lachis: and they sent after him to Lachis, and slew him there.
014	2CH	025	028	And they took him up on horses, and buried him with his fathers in the city of David.
014	2CH	026	001	Then all the people of the land took Ozias, and he was sixteen years old, and they made him king in the room of his father Amasias.
014	2CH	026	002	He built Aelath, he recovered it to Juda, after the king slept with his fathers.
014	2CH	026	003	Ozias began to reign at the age of sixteen years, and he reigned fifty-two years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Jechelia of Jerusalem.
014	2CH	026	004	And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, according to all that Amasias his father did.
014	2CH	026	005	And he sought the Lord in the days of Zacharias, who understood the fear of the Lord; and in his days he sought the Lord, and the Lord prospered him.
014	2CH	026	006	And he went out and fought against the Philistines, and pulled down the walls of Geth, and the walls of Jabner, and the walls of Azotus, and he built cities [near] Azotus, and among the Philistines.
014	2CH	026	007	And the Lord strengthened him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians that dwelt on the rock, and against the Minaeans.
014	2CH	026	008	And the Minaeans gave gifts to Ozias; and his fame spread as far as the entering in of Egypt, for he strengthened [himself] exceedingly.
014	2CH	026	009	And Ozias built towers in Jerusalem, both at the gate of the corners, and at the valley gate, and at the corners and he fortified them.
014	2CH	026	010	And he built towers in the wilderness, and dug many wells, for he had many cattle in the low country and in the plain; and vinedressers in the mountain country and in Carmel: for he was a husbandman.
014	2CH	026	011	And Ozias had a host of warriors, and that went out orderly to war, and returned orderly in number; and their number was [made] by the hand of Jeiel the scribe, and Maasias the judge, by the hand of Ananias the king's deputy.
014	2CH	026	012	The whole number of the chiefs of families of the mighty men of war [was] two thousand six hundred;
014	2CH	026	013	and with them was a warrior force, three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred: these waged war mightily to help the king against [his] enemies.
014	2CH	026	014	And Ozias prepared for them, [even] for all the host, shields, and spears, and helmets, and breastplates, and bows, and slings for stones.
014	2CH	026	015	And he made in Jerusalem machines invented by a wise contriver, to be upon the towers and upon the corners, to cast darts and great stones: and [the fame] of their preparation was heard at a distance; for he was wonderfully helped, till he was strong.
014	2CH	026	016	And when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to his destruction; and he transgressed against the Lord his God, and went into the temple of the Lord to turn incense on the altar of incense.
014	2CH	026	017	And there went in after him Azarias the priest, and with him eighty priests of the Lord, mighty men.
014	2CH	026	018	And they withstood Ozias the king, and said to him, [It is] not for thee, Ozias, to burn incense to the Lord, but only for the priests the sons of Aaron, who are consecrated to sacrifice: go forth of the sanctuary, for thou hast departed from the Lord; and this shall not be for glory to thee from the Lord god.
014	2CH	026	019	And Ozias was angry, and in his hand [was] the censer to burn incense in the temple: and when he was angry with the priests, then the leprosy rose up in his forehead before the priests in the house of the Lord, over the altar of incense.
014	2CH	026	020	And Azarias the chief priest, and the [other] priests, turned [to look] at him, and, behold, he [was] leprous in his forehead; and they got him hastily out thence, for he also hasted to go out, because the Lord had rebuked him.
014	2CH	026	021	And Ozias the king was a leper to the day of his death, and he dwelt [as] a leper in a separate house; for he was cut off from the house of the Lord: and Joathan his son [was set] over his kingdom, judging the people of the land.
014	2CH	026	022	And the rest of the acts of Ozias, the first and the last, [are] written by Jessias the prophet.
014	2CH	026	023	And Ozias slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the field of the burial [place] of the kings, for they said, He is a leper; and Joatham his son reigned in his stead.
014	2CH	027	001	Joatham [was] twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name [was] Jerusa, daughter of Sadoc.
014	2CH	027	002	And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, according to all that his father Ozias did: but he went not into the temple of the Lord. And still the people corrupted themselves.
014	2CH	027	003	He built the high gate of the house of the Lord, and he built much in the wall of Opel.
014	2CH	027	004	In the mountain of Juda, and in the woods, [he built] both dwelling-places and towers.
014	2CH	027	005	He fought against the king of the children of Ammon, and prevailed against him: and the children of Ammon gave him even annually a hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of wheat, and ten thousand of barley. These the king of the children of Ammon brought to him annually in the first and second and third years.
014	2CH	027	006	Joatham grew strong, because he prepared his ways before the Lord his God.
014	2CH	027	007	And the rest of the acts of Joatham, and his war, and his deeds, behold, [they are] written in the book of the kings of Juda and Israel.
014	2CH	027	009	And Joatham slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David: and Achaz his son reigned in his stead.
014	2CH	028	001	Achaz was five and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: and he did not that which was right in the sight of the Lord, as David his father.
014	2CH	028	002	But he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, for he made graven images.
014	2CH	028	003	And [he sacrificed] to their idols in the valley of Benennom, and passed his children through the fire, according to the abominations of the heathen, whom the Lord cast out from before the children of Israel.
014	2CH	028	004	And he burnt incense upon the high places, and upon the roofs, and under every shady tree.
014	2CH	028	005	And the Lord his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria; and he smote him, and took captive of them a great band of prisoners, and carried him to Damascus. Also [God] delivered him into the hands of the king of Israel, who smote him with a great slaughter.
014	2CH	028	006	And Phakee the son of Romelias king of Israel, slew in Juda in one day a hundred and twenty thousand mighty men; because they had forsaken the Lord God of their fathers.
014	2CH	028	007	And Zechri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Maasias the king's son, and Ezrican the chief of his house, and Elcana the king's deputy.
014	2CH	028	008	And the children of Israel took captive of their brethren three hundred thousand, women, and sons, and daughters, and they spoiled them of much property, and brought the spoils to Samaria.
014	2CH	028	009	And there was there a prophet of the Lord, his name [was] Oded: and he went out to meet the host that were coming to Samaria, and said to them, Behold, the wrath of the Lord God of your fathers [is] upon Juda, and he has delivered them into your hands, and ye have slain them in wrath, and it has reached even to heaven.
014	2CH	028	010	And now ye talk of keeping the children of Juda and Jerusalem for servants and handmaidens. Lo, am I not with you to testify for the Lord your God?
014	2CH	028	011	And now hearken to me, and restore the prisoners of your brethren whom ye have taken: for the fierce anger of the Lord [is] upon you.
014	2CH	028	012	And the chiefs of the sons of Ephraim rose up, Udias the son of Joanas, and Barachias the son of Mosolamoth, and Ezekias the son of Sellem, and Amasias the son of Eldai, against those that came from the war,
014	2CH	028	013	and said to them, Ye shall not bring in hither the prisoners to us, for whereas sin against the Lord [is] upon us, ye mean to add to our sins, and to our trespass: for our sin [is] great, and the fierce anger of the Lord [is] upon Israel.
014	2CH	028	014	So the warriors left the prisoners and the spoils before the princes and all the congregation.
014	2CH	028	015	And the men who were called by name rose up, and took hold of the prisoners, and clothed all the naked from the spoils, and gave them garments and shoes, and gave them [food] to eat, and [oil] to anoint themselves [with], and they helped also every one that was weak with asses, and placed them in Jericho, the city of palm-trees, with their brethren; and they returned to Samaria.
014	2CH	028	016	At that time king Achaz sent to the king of Assyria to help him, and on this occasion,
014	2CH	028	017	because the Idumeans had attacked [him], and smitten Juda, and taken a number of prisoners.
014	2CH	028	018	Also the Philistines had made an attack on the cities of the plain country, and the cities of the south of Juda, and taken Baethsamys, and [the things in the house of the Lord, and the things in the house of the king, and of the princes: and they gave to the king] Aelon, and Galero, and Socho and her villages, and Thamna and her villages, and Gamzo and her villages: and they dwelt there.
014	2CH	028	019	For the Lord humbled Juda because of Achaz king of Juda, because he grievously departed from the Lord.
014	2CH	028	020	And there came against him Thalgaphellasar king of Assyria, and he afflicted him.
014	2CH	028	021	And Achaz took the things [that were] in the house of the Lord, and the things in the house of the king, and of the princes, and gave them to the king of Assyria: but he was no help to him,
014	2CH	028	022	but only [troubled him] in his affliction: and he departed yet more from the Lord, and king Achaz said,
014	2CH	028	023	I will seek after the gods of Damascus that smite me. And he said, Forasmuch as the gods of the king of Syria themselves strengthen them, therefore will I sacrifice to them, and they will help me. But they became a stumbling-block to him, and to all Israel.
014	2CH	028	024	And Achaz removed the vessels of the house of the Lord, and cut them in pieces, and shut the doors of the house of the Lord, and made to himself altars in every corner in Jerusalem:
014	2CH	028	025	and in each several city in Juda he made high places to burn incense to strange gods: and they provoked the Lord God of their fathers.
014	2CH	028	026	And the rest of his acts, and his deeds, the first and the last, behold, [they are] written in the book of the kings of Juda and Israel.
014	2CH	028	027	And Achaz slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David; for they did not bring him into the sepulchres of the kings of Israel: and Ezekias his son reigned in his stead.
014	2CH	029	001	And Ezekias began to reign at the age of twenty-five years, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Abia, daughter of Zacharias.
014	2CH	029	002	And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, according to all that his father David had done.
014	2CH	029	003	And it came to pass, when he was established over his kingdom, in the first month, he opened the doors of the house of the Lord, and repaired them.
014	2CH	029	004	And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and put them on the east side,
014	2CH	029	005	and said to them, Hear, ye Levites: now sanctify yourselves, and sanctify the house of the Lord God of your fathers, and cast out the impurity from the holy places.
014	2CH	029	006	For our fathers have revolted, and done that which was evil before the Lord our God, and have forsaken him, and have turned away their face from the tabernacle of the Lord, and have turned [their] back.
014	2CH	029	007	And they have shut up the doors of the temple, and put out the lamps, and have not burnt incense, and have not offered whole-burnt-offerings in the holy [place] to the God of Israel.
014	2CH	029	008	And the Lord was very angry with Juda and Jerusalem, and made them an astonishment, and a desolation, and a hissing, as ye see with your eyes.
014	2CH	029	009	And, behold, your fathers have been smitten with the sword, and your sons and your daughters and your wives are in captivity in a land not their own, as it is even now.
014	2CH	029	010	Therefore it is now in my heart to make a covenant, a covenant with the Lord God of Israel, that he may turn away his fierce wrath from us.
014	2CH	029	011	And now be not wanting [to your duty], for the Lord has chosen you to stand before him to minister, and to be ministers and burners of incense to him.
014	2CH	029	012	Then the Levites rose up, Maath the son of Amasi, and Joel the son of Azarias, of the sons of Caath: and of the sons of Merari, Kis the son of Abdi, and Azarias the son of Haelel: and of the sons of Gedsoni, Jodaad the son of Zemmath, and Joadam: these [were] the sons of Joacha.
014	2CH	029	013	And of the sons of Elisaphan; Zambri, and Jeiel: and of the sons of Asaph; Zacharias, and Matthanias:
014	2CH	029	014	and of the sons of Aeman; Jeiel, and Semei: and of the sons of Idithun; Samaisa, and Oziel.
014	2CH	029	015	And they gathered their brethren, and they purified themselves according to the king's command by the order of the Lord, to purify the house of the Lord.
014	2CH	029	016	And the priests entered into the house of the Lord, to purify [it], and they cast out all the uncleanness that was found in the house of the Lord, even into the court of the house of the Lord: and the Levites received [it] to cast into the brook of Kedron without.
014	2CH	029	017	And [Ezekias] began on the first day, [even] on the new moon of the first month, to purify, and on the eighth day of the month they entered into the temple of the Lord: and they purified the house of the Lord in eight days; and on the thirteenth day of the first month they finished [the work].
014	2CH	029	018	And they went in to king Ezekias, and said, We have purified all the things in the house of the Lord, the altar of whole-burnt-offering, and its vessels, and the table of shew-bread, and its vessels;
014	2CH	029	019	and all the vessels which king Achaz polluted in his reign, in his apostasy, we have prepared and purified: behold, they are before the altar of the Lord.
014	2CH	029	020	And king Ezekias rose early in the morning, and gathered the chief men of the city, and went up to the house of the Lord.
014	2CH	029	021	And he brought seven calves, seven rams, seven lambs, seven kids of goats for a sin-offering, for the kingdom, and for the holy things, and for Israel: and he told the priests the sons of Aaron to go up to the altar of the Lord.
014	2CH	029	022	And they slew the calves, and the priests received the blood, and poured it on the altar: and they slew the rams, and poured the blood upon the altar: also they slew the lambs, and poured the blood round the altar.
014	2CH	029	023	And they brought the goats for a sin-offering before the king and the congregation; and laid their hands upon them.
014	2CH	029	024	And the priests slew them, and offered their blood as a propitiation on the altar; and they made atonement for all Israel: for the king said, The whole-burnt-offering, and the sin-offering [are] for all Israel.
014	2CH	029	025	And he stationed the Levites in the house of the Lord with cymbals, and lutes, and harps, according to the commandment of king David, and of Gad the king's seer, and Nathan the prophet: for by the commandment of the Lord the order [was] in the hand of the prophets.
014	2CH	029	026	And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets.
014	2CH	029	027	And Ezekias told [them] to offer up the whole-burnt-offering on the altar: and when they began to offer the whole-burnt-offering, they began to sing to the Lord, and the trumpets [accompanied] the instruments of David king of Israel.
014	2CH	029	028	And all the congregation worshipped, and the psalm-singers [were] singing, and the trumpets sounding, until the whole-burnt-sacrifice had been completely offered.
014	2CH	029	029	And when they had done offering [it], the king and all that were present bowed, and worshipped.
014	2CH	029	030	And king Ezekias and the princes told the Levites to sing hymns to the Lord in the words of David, and of Asaph the prophet: and they sang hymns with gladness, and fell down and worshipped.
014	2CH	029	031	Then Ezekias answered and said, Now ye have consecrated yourselves to the Lord, bring near and offer sacrifices of praise in the house of the Lord. And the congregation brought sacrifices and thank-offerings into the house of the Lord; and every one who was ready in his heart [brought] whole-burnt-offerings.
014	2CH	029	032	And the number of the whole-burnt-offerings which the congregation brought, was seventy calves, a hundred rams, two hundred lambs: all these [were] for a whole-burnt-offering to the Lord.
014	2CH	029	033	And the consecrated calves were six hundred, [and] the sheep three thousand.
014	2CH	029	034	But the priests were few, and could not flay the whole-burnt-offering, so their brethren the Levites helped them, until the work was finished, and until the priests had purified themselves: for the Levites [more] zealously purified [themselves] than the priests.
014	2CH	029	035	And the whole-burnt-offering [was] abundant, with the fat of the complete peace-offering, and the drink-offerings of the whole-burnt-sacrifice. So the service was established in the house of the Lord.
014	2CH	029	036	And Ezekias and all the people rejoiced, because God has prepared the people: for the thing was done suddenly.
014	2CH	030	001	And Ezekias sent to all Israel and Juda, and wrote letters to Ephraim and Manasse, that they should come into the house of the Lord to Jerusalem, to keep the passover to the Lord God of Israel.
014	2CH	030	002	For the king, and the princes, and all the congregation in Jerusalem, designed to keep the passover in the second month.
014	2CH	030	003	For they could not keep it at that time, because a sufficient number of priest had not purified themselves, and the people was not gathered to Jerusalem.
014	2CH	030	004	And the proposal pleased the king and the congregation.
014	2CH	030	005	And they established a decree that a proclamation should go through all Israel, from Bersabee to Dan, that they should come and keep the passover to the Lord God of Israel at Jerusalem: for the multitude had not done it lately according to the scripture.
014	2CH	030	006	And the posts went with the letters from the king and the princes to all Israel and Juda, according to the command of the king, saying, Children of Israel, return to the Lord God of Abraam, and Isaac, and Israel, and bring back them that have escaped [even] those that were left of the hand of the king of Assyria.
014	2CH	030	007	And be not as your fathers, and your brethren, who revolted from the Lord God of their fathers, and he gave them up to desolation, as ye see.
014	2CH	030	008	And now harden not your hearts, as your fathers [did]: give glory to the Lord God, and enter into his sanctuary, which he has sanctified for ever: and serve the Lord your God, and he shall turn away [his] fierce anger from you.
014	2CH	030	009	For when ye turn to the Lord, your brethren and your children shall be pitied before all that have carried them captives, and he will restore [you] to this land: for the Lord our God is merciful and pitiful, and will not turn away his face from you, if we return to him.
014	2CH	030	010	So the posts went through from city to city in mount Ephraim, and Manasse, and as far as Zabulon: and they as it were laughed them to scorn, and mocked them.
014	2CH	030	011	But the men of Aser, and [some] of Manasses and of Zabulon, were ashamed, and came to Jerusalem and Juda.
014	2CH	030	012	And the hand of the Lord was [present] to give them one heart to come, to do according to the commands of the king and of the princes, by the word of the Lord.
014	2CH	030	013	And a great multitude were gathered to Jerusalem to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great congregation.
014	2CH	030	014	And they arose, and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem, and all on which they burnt incense to false [gods] they tore down and cast into the brook Kedron.
014	2CH	030	015	Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the second month: and the priests and the Levites repented, and purified [themselves], and brought whole-burnt-offerings into the house of the Lord.
014	2CH	030	016	And they stood at their post, according to their ordinance, according to the commandment of Moses the man of God: and the priests received the blood from the hand of the Levites.
014	2CH	030	017	For a great part of the congregation was not sanctified; and the Levites were [ready] to kill the passover for every one who could not sanctify himself to the Lord.
014	2CH	030	018	For the greatest part of the people of Ephraim, and Manasse, and Issachar, and Zabulon, had not purified [themselves], but ate the passover contrary to the scripture. On this account also Ezekias prayed concerning them, saying,
014	2CH	030	019	The good Lord be merciful with regard to every heart that sincerely seeks the Lord God of their fathers, and [is] not [purified] according to the purification of the sanctuary.
014	2CH	030	020	And the Lord hearkened to Ezekias, and healed the people.
014	2CH	030	021	And the children of Israel who were present in Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great joy; and they continued to sing hymns to the Lord daily, and the priests and the Levites [played] on instruments to the Lord.
014	2CH	030	022	And Ezekias encouraged all the Levites, and those that had good understanding of the Lord: and they completely kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days, offering peace-offerings, and confessing to the Lord God of their fathers.
014	2CH	030	023	And the congregation purposed together to keep other seven days: and they kept seven days with gladness.
014	2CH	030	024	For Ezekias set apart for Juda, [even] for the congregation, a thousand calves and seven thousand sheep; and the princes set apart for the people a thousand calves and ten thousand sheep: and the holy things of the priests abundantly.
014	2CH	030	025	And all the congregation, the priests and the Levites, rejoiced, and all the congregation of Juda, and they that were present of Jerusalem, and the strangers that came from the land of Israel, and the dwellers in Juda.
014	2CH	030	026	And there was great joy in Jerusalem: from the days of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not such a feast in Jerusalem.
014	2CH	030	027	Then the priests the Levites rose up and blessed the people: and their voice was heard, and their prayer came into his holy dwelling-place, [even] into heaven.
014	2CH	031	001	And when all these things were finished, all Israel that were found in the cities of Juda went out, and broke in pieces the pillars, and cut down the groves, and tore down the high places and the altars out of all Judea and Benjamin, also of Ephraim and Manasse, till they made an end: and all Israel returned, every one to his inheritance, and to their cities.
014	2CH	031	002	And Ezekias appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites, and the courses of each one according to his ministry, to the priests and to the Levites, for the whole-burnt-offering, and for the peace-offering, and to praise, and to give thanks, and to minister in the gates, [and] in the courts of the house of the Lord.
014	2CH	031	003	And the king's proportion out of his substance [was appointed] for the whole-burnt-offerings, the morning and the evening one, and the whole-burnt-offerings for the sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for the feasts that were ordered in the law of the Lord.
014	2CH	031	004	And they told the people who dwelt in Jerusalem, to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might be strong in the ministry of the house of the Lord.
014	2CH	031	005	And as he gave the command, Israel brought abundantly first-fruits of corn, and wine, and oil, and honey, and every fruit of the field: and the children of Israel and Juda brought tithes of everything abundantly.
014	2CH	031	006	And they that dwelt in the cities of Juda themselves also brought tithes of calves and sheep, and tithes of goats, and consecrated them to the Lord their God, and they brought them and laid them in heaps.
014	2CH	031	007	In the third month the heaps began to be piled, and in the seventh month they were finished.
014	2CH	031	008	And Ezekias and the princes came and saw the heaps, and blessed the Lord, and his people Israel.
014	2CH	031	009	Then Ezekias enquired of the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps.
014	2CH	031	010	And Azarias the priest, the chief over the house of Sadoc, spoke to him, and said, From the time that the first-fruits began to be brought into the house of the Lord, we have eaten and drunk, and left even abundantly; for the Lord has blessed his people, and we have left to this amount.
014	2CH	031	011	And Ezekias told them yet farther to prepare chambers for the house of the Lord; and they prepared [them],
014	2CH	031	012	and they brought thither the first-fruits and the tithes faithfully: and Chonenias the Levite was superintendent over them, and Semei his brother was next.
014	2CH	031	013	and Jeiel, and Ozias, and Naeth, and Asael, and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Samachia, and Maath, and Banaias, and his sons, were appointed by Chonenias and Semei his brother, as Ezekias the king, and Azarias who was over the house of the Lord commanded.
014	2CH	031	014	And Core, the [son] of Jemna the Levite, the porter eastward, [was] over the gifts, to distribute the first-fruits of the Lord, and the most holy things,
014	2CH	031	015	by the hand of Odom, and Benjamin, and Jesus, and Semei, and Amarias, and Sechonias, by the hand of the priests faithfully, to give to their brethren according to the courses, as well to great as small;
014	2CH	031	016	besides the increase of males from three years old and upward, to every one entering into the house of the Lord, [a portion] according to a daily rate, for service in the daily courses of their order.
014	2CH	031	017	This [is] the distribution of the priests according to the houses of their families; and the Levites in their daily courses from twenty years old and upward [were] in [their] order,
014	2CH	031	018	to assign stations for all the increase of their sons and their daughters, for the whole number: for they faithfully sanctified the holy place.
014	2CH	031	019	As for the sons of Aaron that executed the priests' office, —even those from their cities the men in each several city who were named expressly, —[were appointed] to give a portion to every male among the priests, and to every one reckoned among the Levites.
014	2CH	031	020	And Ezekias did so through all Juda, and did that which was good and right before the Lord his God.
014	2CH	031	021	And in every work which he began in service in the house of the Lord, and in the law, and in the ordinances, he sought his God with all his soul, and wrought, and prospered.
014	2CH	032	001	And after these things and this faithful dealing, came Sennacherim king of the Assyrians, and he came to Juda, and encamped against the fortified cities, and intended to take them for himself.
014	2CH	032	002	And Ezekias saw that Sennacherim was come, and [that] his face [was set] to fight against Jerusalem.
014	2CH	032	003	And he took counsel with his elders and his mighty [men] to stop the wells of water which were without the city: and they helped him.
014	2CH	032	004	And he collected many people, and stopped the wells of water, and the river that flowed through the city, saying, Lest the king of Assyria come, and find much water, and strengthen [himself].
014	2CH	032	005	And Ezekias strengthened [himself], and built all the wall that had been pulled down, and the towers, and another wall in front without, and fortified the strong place of the city of David, and prepared arms in abundance.
014	2CH	032	006	And he appointed captains of war over the people, and they were gathered to [meet] him to the open place of the gate of the valley, and he encouraged them, saying,
014	2CH	032	007	Be strong and courageous, and fear not, neither be dismayed before the King of Assyria, and before all the nation that [is] with him: for [there are] more with us than with him.
014	2CH	032	008	With him [are] arms of flesh; but with us [is] the Lord our God to save [us], and to fight our battle. And the people were encouraged at the words of Ezekias king of Juda.
014	2CH	032	009	And afterward Sennacherim king of the Assyrians sent his servants to Jerusalem; and [he went] himself against Lachis, and all his army with him, and sent to Ezekias king of Juda, and to all Juda that [was] in Jerusalem, saying,
014	2CH	032	010	Thus says Sennacherim king of the Assyrians, On what do ye trust, that ye will remain in the siege in Jerusalem?
014	2CH	032	011	Does not Ezekias deceive you, to deliver you to death and famine and thirst, saying, The Lord our God will deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria?
014	2CH	032	012	Is not this Ezekias who has taken down his altars and his high places and has spoken to Juda and the dwellers in Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall worship before this altar and burn incense upon it?
014	2CH	032	013	Know ye not what I and my fathers have done to all the nations of the countries? Could the gods of the nations of all the earth at all rescue their people out of my hand?
014	2CH	032	014	Who is there among all the gods of those nations whom my fathers utterly destroyed, [worthy of trust]? Could they deliver their people out of my hand, that your God should deliver you out of my hand?
014	2CH	032	015	Now then, let not Ezekias deceive you, and let him not make you thus confident, and believe him not: for no god of any kingdom or nation is at all able to deliver his people out of my hand, or the hand of my fathers: therefore your God shall not deliver you out of my hand.
014	2CH	032	016	And his servants continued to speak against the Lord God, and against his servant Ezekias.
014	2CH	032	017	And he wrote a letter to reproach the Lord God of Israel, and spoke concerning him, saying, As the gods of the nations of the earth have not delivered their people out of my hand, so the God of Ezekias shall by no means deliver his people out of my hand.
014	2CH	032	018	And he cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language to the people of Jerusalem on the wall, [calling them] to assist them, and pull down [the walls], that they might take the city.
014	2CH	032	019	And he spoke against the God of Jerusalem, even as against the gods of the nations of the earth, the works of the hands of men.
014	2CH	032	020	And king Ezekias and Esaias the prophet the son of Amos prayed concerning these things, and they cried to heaven.
014	2CH	032	021	And the Lord sent an angel, and he destroyed every mighty man and warrior, and leader and captain in the camp of the king of Assyria: and he returned with shame of face to his own land and came into the house of his god: and [some] of them that came out of his bowels slew him with the sword.
014	2CH	032	022	So the Lord delivered Ezekias and the dwellers in Jerusalem out of the hand of Sennacherim King of Assyria, and out of the hand of all [his enemies], and gave them rest round about.
014	2CH	032	023	And many brought gifts to the Lord to Jerusalem, and presents to Ezekias king of Juda; and he was exalted in the eyes of all the nations after these things.
014	2CH	032	024	In those days Ezekias was sick even to death, and prayed to the Lord: and he hearkened to him, and gave him a sign.
014	2CH	032	025	But Ezekias did not recompense the Lord according to the return which he made him, but his heart was lifted up: and wrath came upon him, and upon Juda and Jerusalem.
014	2CH	032	026	And Ezekias humbled himself after the exaltation of his heart, he and the dwellers in Jerusalem; and the wrath of the Lord did not come upon them in the days of Ezekias.
014	2CH	032	027	And Ezekias had wealth and very great glory: and he made for himself treasuries of gold, and silver, and precious stones, also for spices, and stores for arms, and for precious vessels;
014	2CH	032	028	and cities for the produce of corn, and wine, and oil; and stalls and mangers for every [kind of] cattle, and folds for flocks;
014	2CH	032	029	and cities which he built for himself, and store of sheep and oxen in abundance, for the Lord gave him a very great store.
014	2CH	032	030	The same Ezekias stopped up the course of the water of Gion above, and brought the water down straight south of the city of David. And Ezekias prospered in all his works.
014	2CH	032	031	Notwithstanding, in regard to the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who were sent to him to enquire of him [concerning] the prodigy which came upon the land, the Lord left him, to try him, to know what was in his heart.
014	2CH	032	032	And the rest of the acts of Ezekias, and his kindness, behold, they are written in the prophecy of Esaias the son of Amos the prophet, and in the book of the kings of Juda and Israel.
014	2CH	032	033	And Ezekias slept with his fathers, and they buried him in a high place among the sepulchres of the sons of David: and all Juda and the dwellers in Jerusalem gave him glory and honour at his death. And Manasses his son reigned in his stead.
014	2CH	033	001	Manasses was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem.
014	2CH	033	002	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, according to all the abominations of the heathen, whom the Lord destroyed from before the face of the children of Israel.
014	2CH	033	003	And he returned and built the high places, which his father Ezekias had pulled down, and set up images to Baalim, and made groves, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them.
014	2CH	033	004	And he built altars in the house of the Lord, concerning which the Lord said, In Jerusalem shall be my name for ever.
014	2CH	033	005	And he built altars to all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the Lord.
014	2CH	033	006	He also passed his children through the fire in the valley of Benennom; and he divined, and used auspices, and sorceries, and appointed those who had divining spirits, and enchanters, and wrought abundant wickedness before the Lord, to provoke him.
014	2CH	033	007	And he set the graven [image], the molten [statue], the idol which he made, in the house of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put my name for ever;
014	2CH	033	008	and I will not again remove the foot of Israel from the land which I gave to their fathers, if only they will take heed to do all things which I have commanded them, according to all the law and the ordinances and the judgments [given] by the hand of Moses.
014	2CH	033	009	So Manasses led astray Juda and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, to do evil beyond all the nations which the Lord cast out from before the children of Israel.
014	2CH	033	010	And the Lord spoke to Manasses, and to his people: but they hearkened not.
014	2CH	033	011	And the Lord brought upon them the captains of the host of the king of Assyria, and they took Manasses in bonds, and bound him in fetters, and brought him to Babylon.
014	2CH	033	012	And when he was afflicted, he sought the face of the Lord his God, and was greatly humbled before the face of the God of his fathers;
014	2CH	033	013	and he prayed to him: and he hearkened to him, and listened to his cry, and brought him back to Jerusalem to his kingdom: and Manasses knew that the Lord he is God.
014	2CH	033	014	And afterward he built a wall without the city of David, from the southwest southward in the valleys and at the entrance through the fish-gate, as men go out by the gate round about, even as far as Opel: and he raised it much, and set captains of the host in all the fortified cities in Juda.
014	2CH	033	015	And he removed the strange gods, and the graven [image] out of the house of the Lord, and all the altars which he had built in the mount of the house of the Lord, and in Jerusalem, and without the city.
014	2CH	033	016	And he repaired the altar of the Lord, and offered upon it a sacrifice of peace-offering and thank-offering, and he told Juda to serve the Lord God of Israel.
014	2CH	033	017	Nevertheless the people still sacrificed on the high places, only to the Lord their God.
014	2CH	033	018	And the rest of the acts of Manasses, and his prayer to God, and the words of the seers that spoke to him in the name of the God of Israel,
014	2CH	033	019	behold, [they are] in the account of his prayer; and [God] hearkened to him. And all his sins, and his backslidings, and the spots on which he built the high places, and set there groves and graven images, before he repented, behold, they are written in the books of the seers.
014	2CH	033	020	And Manasses slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the garden of his house: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.
014	2CH	033	021	Amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem.
014	2CH	033	022	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, as his father Manasses did: and Amon sacrificed to all the idols which his father Manasses had made, and served them.
014	2CH	033	023	And he was not humbled before the Lord as his father Manasses was humbled; for his son Amon abounded in transgression.
014	2CH	033	024	And his servants conspired against him, and slew him in his house.
014	2CH	033	025	And the people of the land slew the men who had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josias his son king in his stead.
014	2CH	034	001	Josias was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem.
014	2CH	034	002	And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, and walked in the ways of his father David, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left.
014	2CH	034	003	And in the eighth year of his reign, and he [being] yet a youth, he began to seek the Lord God of his father David: and in the twelfth year of his reign he began to purge Juda and Jerusalem from the high places, and the groves, and the ornaments for the altars, and the molten images.
014	2CH	034	004	And he pulled down the altars of Baalim that were before his face, and the high places that were above them; and he cut down the groves, and the graven images, and broke in pieces the molten images, and reduced them to powder, and cast [it] upon the surface of the tombs of those who [had] sacrificed to them.
014	2CH	034	005	And he burnt the bones of the priests upon the altars, and purged Juda and Jerusalem.
014	2CH	034	006	And [he did so] in the cities of Manasse, and Ephraim, and Symeon, and Nephthali, and the places round about them.
014	2CH	034	007	And he pulled down the altars and the groves, and he cut the idols in small pieces, and cut off all the high places from all the land of Israel, and returned to Jerusalem.
014	2CH	034	008	And in the eighteenth year of his reign, after having cleansed the land, and the house, he sent Saphan the son of Ezelias, and Maasa prefect of the city, and Juach son of Joachaz his recorder, to repair the house of the Lord his God.
014	2CH	034	009	And they came to Chelcias the high priest, and gave the money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites who kept the gate collected of the hand of Manasse and Ephraim, and of the princes, and of every one that was left in Israel, and of the children of Juda and Benjamin, and of the dwellers in Jerusalem.
014	2CH	034	010	And they gave it into the hand of the workmen, who were appointed in the house of the Lord, and they gave it to the workmen who wrought in the house of the Lord, to repair and strengthen the house.
014	2CH	034	011	They gave [it] also to the carpenters and builders, to buy squared stones, and timber for beams to cover the houses which the kings of Juda had destroyed.
014	2CH	034	012	And the men [were] faithfully [engaged] in the works: and over them were superintendents, Jeth and Abdias, Levites of the sons of Merari, and Zacharias and Mosollam, of the sons of Caath, [appointed] to oversee; and every Levite, and every one that understood [how] to play on musical instruments.
014	2CH	034	013	And [overseers were] over the burden-bearers, and over all the workmen in the respective works; and of the Levites [were appointed] scribes, and judges, and porters.
014	2CH	034	014	And when they brought forth the money that had been brought into the house of the Lord, Chelcias the priest found a book of the law of the Lord [given] by the hand of Moses.
014	2CH	034	015	And Chelcias answered and said to Saphan the scribe, I have found a book of the law in the house of the Lord. And Chelcias gave the book to Saphan.
014	2CH	034	016	And Saphan brought in the book to the king, and moreover gave an account to the king, [saying, This is] all the money given into the hand of thy servants that work.
014	2CH	034	017	And they have collected the money that was found in the house of the Lord, and given it into the hand of the overseers, and into the hand of them that do the work.
014	2CH	034	018	And Saphan the scribe brought word to the king, saying, Chelcias the priest has given me a book. And Saphan read it before the king.
014	2CH	034	019	And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the law, that he rent his garments.
014	2CH	034	020	And the king commanded Chelcias, and Achicam the son of Saphan, and Abdom the son of Michaias, and Saphan the scribe, and Asia the servant of the king, saying,
014	2CH	034	021	Go, enquire of the Lord for me, and for every one that is left in Israel and Juda, concerning the words of the book that is found: for great is the wrath of the Lord [which] has been kindled amongst us, because our fathers have not hearkened to the words of the Lord, to do according to all the things written in this book.
014	2CH	034	022	And Chelcias went, and [the others] whom the king told, to Olda the prophetess, the wife of Sellem son of Thecoe, son of Aras, who kept the commandments; and she dwelt in Jerusalem in the second [quarter]: and they spoke to her accordingly.
014	2CH	034	023	And she said to them, Thus has the Lord God of Israel said, Tell the man who sent you to me,
014	2CH	034	024	Thus saith the Lord, Behold, I bring evil upon this place, [even] all the words that are written in the book that was read before the king of Juda:
014	2CH	034	025	because they have forsaken me, and burnt incense to strange gods, that they might provoke me by all the works of their hands; and my wrath is kindled against this place, and it shall not be quenched.
014	2CH	034	026	And concerning the king of Juda, who sent you to seek the Lord, —thus shall ye say to him, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, [As for] the words which thou has heard,
014	2CH	034	027	forasmuch as thy heart was ashamed, and thou was humbled before me when thou heardest my words against this place, and against the inhabitants of it, and thou wast humbled before me, and didst rend thy garments, and didst weep before me; I also have heard, saith the Lord.
014	2CH	034	028	Behold, I [will] gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace, and thine eyes shall not look upon all the evils which I am bringing upon this place, and upon the inhabitants of it. And they brought back word to the king.
014	2CH	034	029	And the king sent and gathered the elders of Juda and Jerusalem.
014	2CH	034	030	And the king went up to the house of the Lord, [he] and all Juda, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the people great and small: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that were found in the house of the Lord.
014	2CH	034	031	And the king stood at a pillar, and made a covenant before the Lord, to walk before the Lord, to keep his commandments and testimonies, and his ordinances, with all [his] heart and with all [his] soul, so as to perform the words of the covenant that were written in this book.
014	2CH	034	032	And he caused all that were found in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand; and the inhabitants of Jerusalem made a covenant in the house of the Lord God of their fathers.
014	2CH	034	033	And Josias removed all the abominations out of the whole land which belonged to the children of Israel, and caused all that were found in Jerusalem and in Israel, to serve the Lord their God all his days: he departed not from following the Lord God of his fathers.
014	2CH	035	001	And Josias kept a passover to the Lord his God; and sacrificed the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month.
014	2CH	035	002	And he appointed the priests at their charges, and encouraged them for the services of the house of the Lord.
014	2CH	035	003	And he told the Levites that were able [to act] in all Israel, that they should consecrate themselves to the Lord: and they put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel built: and the king said, Ye must not carry anything on your shoulders: now then minister to the Lord your God, and to his people Israel.
014	2CH	035	004	And prepare yourselves according to the houses of your families, and according to your daily courses, according to the writing of David king of Israel, and [the order] by the hand of his son Solomon.
014	2CH	035	005	And stand ye in the house according to the divisions of the houses of your families for your brethren the sons of the people; [so] also let there be for the Levites a division of the house of their family.
014	2CH	035	006	And kill ye the passover, and prepare [it] for your brethren, to do according to the word of the Lord, by the hand of Moses.
014	2CH	035	007	And Josias gave as an offering to the children of the people, sheep, and lambs, and kids of the young of the goats, all for the passover, [even for] all that were found, in number [amounting to] thirty thousand, and three thousand calves, these [were] of the substance of the king.
014	2CH	035	008	And his princes gave an offering to the people, and to the priests, and to the Levites: and Chelcias and Zacharias and Jeiel the chief men gave to the priests of the house of God, they even gave for the passover sheep, and lambs, and kids, two thousand six hundred, and three hundred calves.
014	2CH	035	009	And Chonenias, and Banaeas, and Samaeas, and Nathanael his brother, and Asabias, and Jeiel, and Jozabad, heads of the Levites, gave an offering to the Levites for the passover, of five thousand sheep and five hundred calves.
014	2CH	035	010	And the service was duly ordered, and the priests stood in their place, and the Levites in their divisions, according to the command of the king.
014	2CH	035	011	And they slew the passover, and the priests sprinkled the blood from their hand, and the Levites flayed [the victims].
014	2CH	035	012	And they prepared the whole-burnt-offering to give to them, according to the division by the houses of families, [even] to the sons of the people, to offer to the Lord, as it is written in the book of Moses.
014	2CH	035	013	And thus [they did] till the morning. And they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance; and boiled the holy [pieces] in copper vessels and caldrons, and [the feast] went on well, and they quickly served all the children of the people.
014	2CH	035	014	And after they had prepared for themselves and for the priests, for the priests [were engaged] in offering the whole-burnt-offerings and the fat until night, then the Levites prepared for themselves, and for their brethren the sons of Aaron.
014	2CH	035	015	And the sons of Asaph the psalm-singers [were] at their post according to the commands of David, and Asaph, and Aeman, and Idithom, the prophets of the king: also, the chiefs and the porters of the several gates; —it was not for them to stir from the service of the holy things, for their brethren the Levites prepared for them.
014	2CH	035	016	So all the service of the Lord was duly ordered and prepared in that day, for keeping the passover, and offering the whole-burnt-sacrifices on the altar of the Lord, according to the command of king Josias.
014	2CH	035	017	And the children of Israel that were present kept the passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days.
014	2CH	035	018	And there was no passover like it in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet, or any king of Israel: they kept not such a passover as Josias, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Juda and Israel that were present, and the dwellers in Jerusalem, kept to the Lord.
014	2CH	035	019	In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josias this passover was kept, after all these things that Josias did in the house. And king Josias burnt those who had in them a divining spirit, and the wizards, and the images, and the idols, and the sodomites which were in the land of Juda and in Jerusalem, that he might confirm the words of the law that were written in the book which Chelcias the priest found in the house of the Lord. There was no [king] like him before him, who turned to the Lord with all his heart, and all his soul, and all his strength, according to all the law of Moses, and after him there rose up none like him. Nevertheless the Lord turned not from the anger of his fierce wrath, wherewith the Lord was greatly angry against Juda, for all the provocations wherewith Manasses provoked him: and the Lord said, I will even remove Juda also from my presence, as I have removed Israel, and I have rejected the city which I chose, [even] Jerusalem, and thehouse of which I said, My name shall be there.
014	2CH	035	020	And Pharao Nechao king of Egypt went up against the king of the Assyrians to the river Euphrates, and king Josias went to meet him.
014	2CH	035	021	And he sent messengers to him, saying, What have I to do with thee, O king of Juda? I am not come to-day to war against thee; and God has told me to hasten: beware of the God that is with me, lest he destroy thee.
014	2CH	035	022	However, Josias turned not his face from him, but strengthened himself to fight against him, and hearkened not to the words of Nechao by the mouth of God, and he came to fight in the plain of Mageddo.
014	2CH	035	023	And the archers shot at king Josias; and the king said to his servants, Take me away, for I am severely wounded.
014	2CH	035	024	And his servants lifted him out of the chariot, and put him in the second chariot which he had, and brought him to Jerusalem; and he died, and was buried with his fathers: and all Juda and Jerusalem lamented over Josias.
014	2CH	035	025	And Jeremias mourned over Josias, and all the chief men and chief women uttered a lamentation over Josias until this day: and they made it an ordinance for Israel, and, behold, it is written in the lamentations.
014	2CH	035	026	And the rest of the acts of Josias, and his hope, are written in the law of the Lord.
014	2CH	035	027	And his acts, the first and the last, behold, [they are] written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.
014	2CH	036	001	And the people of the land took Joachaz the son of Josias, and anointed him, and made him king over Jerusalem in the room of his father.
014	2CH	036	002	Joachaz [was] twenty-three years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Amital, daughter of Jeremias of Lobna. And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, according to all that his fathers had done. And Pharao Nechao bound him in Deblatha in the land of Aemath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem.
014	2CH	036	003	And the king brought him over to Egypt; and imposed a tribute on the land, a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.
014	2CH	036	004	And Pharao Nechao made Eliakim the son of Josias king over Juda in the room of his father Josias, and changed his name [to] Joakim. And Pharao Nechao took his brother Joachaz and brought him into Egypt, and he died there: but [he] had given the silver and gold to Pharao. At that time the land began to be taxed to give the money at the command of Pharao; and every one as he could borrowed the silver and the gold of the people of the land, to give to Pharao Nechao.
014	2CH	036	005	Joachim was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name [was] Zechora, daughter of Nerias of Rama. And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, according to all that his fathers did. In his days came Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon into the land, and he served him three years, and [then] revolted from him. And the Lord sent against them the Chaldeans, and plundering parties of Syrians, and plundering parties of the Moabites, and of the children of Ammon, and of Samaria; but after this they departed, according to the word of the Lord by the hand of his servants the prophets. Nevertheless the wrath of the Lord was upon Juda, so that they should be removed from his presence, because of the sins of Manasses in all that he did, and for the innocent blood which Joakim shed, for he had filled Jerusalem with innocent blood; yet the Lord would not utterly destroy them.
014	2CH	036	006	And Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon came up against him, and bound him with brazen fetters, and carried him away to Babylon.
014	2CH	036	007	And he carried away a part of the vessels of the house of the Lord to Babylon, and put them in his temple in Babylon.
014	2CH	036	008	And the rest of the acts of Joakim, and all that he did, behold, [are] not these things written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Juda? And Joakim slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in Ganozae: and Jechonias his son reigned in his stead.
014	2CH	036	009	Jechonias [was] eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem, and did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord.
014	2CH	036	010	And at the turn of the year, king Nabuchodonosor sent, and brought him to Babylon, with the precious vessels of the house of the Lord, and made Sedekias his father's brother king over Juda and Jerusalem.
014	2CH	036	011	Sedekias [was] twenty-one years old when he began to reign, and be reigned eleven years in Jerusalem.
014	2CH	036	012	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord his God: he was not ashamed before the prophet Jeremias, nor because of the word of the Lord;
014	2CH	036	013	in that he rebelled against king Nabuchodonosor, which he adjured him by God [not to do]: but he stiffened his neck, and hardened his heart, so as not to return to the Lord God of Israel.
014	2CH	036	014	And all the great men of Juda, and the priests, and the people of the land transgressed abundantly in the abominations of the heathen, and polluted the house of the Lord which [was] in Jerusalem.
014	2CH	036	015	And the Lord God of their fathers sent by the hand of his prophets; rising early and sending his messengers, for he spared his people, and his sanctuary.
014	2CH	036	016	Nevertheless they sneered at his messengers, and set at nought his words, and mocked his prophets, until the wrath of the Lord rose up against his people, till there was no remedy.
014	2CH	036	017	And he brought against them the king of the Chaldeans, and slew their young men with the sword in the house of his sanctuary, and did not spare Sedekias, and had no mercy upon their virgins, and they led away their old men: he delivered all things into their hands.
014	2CH	036	018	And all the vessels of the house of God, the great and the small, and the treasures of the house of the Lord, and all the treasures of the king and the great men; he brought all to Babylon.
014	2CH	036	019	And he burnt the house of the Lord, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem, and burnt its palaces with fire, and [utterly destroyed] every beautiful vessel.
014	2CH	036	020	And he carried away the remnant to Babylon; and they were servants to him and to his sons until [the establishment of] the kingdom of the Medes.
014	2CH	036	021	That the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremias might be fulfilled, until the land should enjoy its sabbaths in resting [and] sabbath keeping all the days of its desolation, till the accomplishment of seventy years.
014	2CH	036	022	In the first year of Cyrus king of the Persians, after the fulfillment of the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremias, the Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of the Persians, and told him to make proclamation in writing throughout all his kingdom, saying,
014	2CH	036	023	Thus says Cyrus king of the Persians to all the kingdoms of the earth, The Lord God of heaven has given me [power], and he has commanded me to build a house to him in Jerusalem, in Judea. Who [is there] of you of all his people? His God shall be with him, and let him go up.

015	EZR	001	001	Now in the first year of Cyrus king of the Persians, that the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremias might be fulfilled, the Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of the Persians, and he issued a proclamation through all his kingdom, and that in writing, saying,
015	EZR	001	002	Thus said Cyrus king of the Persians, The Lord God of heaven has given me all the kingdoms of the earth, and he has given me a charge to build him a house in Jerusalem that is in Judea.
015	EZR	001	003	Who [is] there among you of all his people? for his God shall be with him, and he shall go up to Jerusalem that is in Judea, and let him build the house of the God of Israel: he [is] the God that is in Jerusalem.
015	EZR	001	004	And [let] every [Jew] that is left [go] from every place where he sojourns, and the men of his place shall help him with silver, and gold, and goods, and cattle, together with the voluntary offering for the house of God that is in Jerusalem.
015	EZR	001	005	Then the chiefs of the families of Juda and Benjamin arose, and the priests, and the Levites, all whose spirit the Lord stirred up to go up to build the house of the Lord that [is] in Jerusalem.
015	EZR	001	006	And all that were round about strengthened their hands with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, and with cattle, and with presents, besides the voluntary offerings.

015	EZR	003	002	Then stood up Jesus the [son] of Josedec, and his brethren the priests, and Zorobabel the [son] of Salathiel, and his brethren, and they built the altar of the God of Israel, to offer upon it whole-burnt-offerings, according to the things that were written in the law of Moses the man of God.
015	EZR	003	003	And they set up the altar on its place, for there was a terror upon them because of the people of the lands: and the whole-burnt-offerings was offered up upon it to the Lord morning and evening.
015	EZR	003	004	And they kept the feast of tabernacles, according to that which was written, and [offered] whole-burnt-offerings daily in number according to the ordinance, the exact daily rate.
015	EZR	003	005	And after this the perpetual whole-burnt-offering, and [offering] for the season of new moon, and for all the hallowed feasts to the Lord, and for every one that offered a free-will-offering to the Lord.
015	EZR	003	006	On the first day of the seventh month they began to offer whole-burnt-offerings to the Lord: but the foundation of the house of the Lord was not laid.
015	EZR	003	007	And they gave money to the stone-hewers and carpenters, and meat and drink, and oil, to the Sidonians, and Tyrians, to bring cedar trees from Libanus to the sea of Joppa, according to the grant of Cyrus king of the Persians to them.
015	EZR	003	008	And in the second year of their coming to the house of God in Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zorobabel the [son] of Salathiel, and Jesus the [son] of Josedec, and the rest of their brethren the priests and the Levites, and all who came from the captivity to Jerusalem, and they appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, over the workmen in the house of the Lord.
015	EZR	003	009	And Jesus and his sons and his brethren stood, Cadmiel and his sons the sons of Juda, over them that wrought the works in the house of God: the sons of Enadad, their sons and their brethren the Levites.
015	EZR	003	010	And they laid a foundation for building the house of the Lord: and the priests in their robes stood with trumpets and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise the Lord, according to the order of David king of Israel.
015	EZR	003	011	And they answered [each other] with praise and thanksgiving to the Lord, [saying], For [it is] good, for his mercy to Israel [endures] for ever. And all the people shouted with a loud voice to praise the Lord at the laying the foundation of the house of the Lord.
015	EZR	003	012	But many of the priests and the Levites, and the elder men, heads of families, who had seen the former house on its foundation, and [who saw] this house with their eyes, wept with a loud voice: but the multitude shouted with joy to raise a song.
015	EZR	003	013	And the people did not distinguish the voice of the glad shout from the voice of the weeping of the people: for the people shouted with a loud voice, and the voice was heard even from afar off.
015	EZR	004	001	And they that afflicted Juda and Benjamin heard, that the children of the captivity were building a house to the Lord God of Israel.
015	EZR	004	002	And they drew near to Zorobabel, and to the heads of families, and said to them, We will build with you; for as ye [do], we seek [to serve] our God, and we do sacrifice to him from the days of Asaradan king of Assur, who brought us hither.
015	EZR	004	003	then Zorobabel, and Jesus and the rest of the heads of the families of Israel said to them, [It is] not for us and you to build a house to our God, for we ourselves will build together to the Lord our God, as Cyrus the king of the Persians commanded us.
015	EZR	004	004	And the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Juda, and hindered them in building,
015	EZR	004	005	and [continued] hiring [persons] against them, plotting to frustrate their counsel, all the days of Cyrus king of the Persians, and until the reign of Darius king of the Persians.
015	EZR	004	006	And in the reign of Assuerus, even in the beginning of his reign, they wrote a letter against the inhabitants of Juda and Jerusalem.
015	EZR	004	007	And in the days of Arthasastha, Tabeel wrote peaceably to Mithradates and to the rest of his fellow-servants: the tribute-gatherer wrote to Arthasastha king of the Persians a writing in the Syrian tongue, and [the same] interpreted.
015	EZR	004	008	Reum the chancellor, and Sampsa the scribe wrote an epistle against Jerusalem to King Arthasastha, [saying,]
015	EZR	004	009	Thus has judged Reum the chancellor, and Sampsa the scribe, and the rest of our fellow-servants, the Dinaeans, the Apharsathachaeans, the Tarphalaeans, the Apharsaeans, the Archyaeans, the Babylonians, the Susanachaeans, Davaeans,
015	EZR	004	010	and the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Assenaphar removed, and settled them in the cities of Somoron, and the rest [of them] beyond the river.
015	EZR	004	011	This [is] the purport of the letter, which they sent to him: Thy servants the men beyond the river to king Arthasastha.
015	EZR	004	012	Be it known to the king, that the Jews who came up from thee to us have come to Jerusalem the rebellious and wicked city, which they are building, and its walls are set in order, and they have established the foundations of it.
015	EZR	004	013	Now then be it known to the king, that if that city be built up, and its walls completed, thou shalt have no tribute, neither will they pay [anything], and this injures kings.
015	EZR	004	014	And it is not lawful for us to see the dishonour of the king: therefore have we sent and made known [the matter] to the king;
015	EZR	004	015	That examination may be made in thy fathers' book of record; and thou shalt find, and thou shalt know that city [is] rebellious, and does harm to kings and countries, and there are in the midst of it from very old time refuges for [runaway] slaves: therefore this city has been made desolate.
015	EZR	004	016	We therefore declare to the king, that, if that city be built, and its walls be set up, thou shalt not have peace.
015	EZR	004	017	Then the king sent to Reum the chancellor, and Sampsa the scribe, and the rest of their fellow-servants who dwelt in Samaria, and the rest beyond the river, [saying,]Peace; and he says,
015	EZR	004	018	The tribute-gatherer whom ye sent to us, has been called before me.
015	EZR	004	019	And a decree has been made by me, and we have examined, and found that city of old time exalts itself against kings, and that rebellions and desertions take place within it.
015	EZR	004	020	And there were powerful kings in Jerusalem, and they ruled over all the [country] beyond the river, and abundant revenues and tribute were given to them.
015	EZR	004	021	Now therefore make a decree to stop the work of those men, and that city shall no more be built.
015	EZR	004	022	[See] that ye be careful of the decree, [not] to be remiss concerning this matter, lest at any time destruction should abound to the harm of kings.
015	EZR	004	023	Then the tribute-gatherer of king Arthasastha read [the letter] before Reum the chancellor, and Sampsa the scribe, and his fellow-servants: and they went in haste to Jerusalem and through Juda, and caused them to cease with horses and an [armed] force.
015	EZR	004	024	Then ceased the work of the house of God in Jerusalem, and it was at a stand until the second year of the reign of Darius king of the Persians.
015	EZR	005	001	And Aggaeus the prophet, and Zacharias the [son] of Addo, prophesied a prophesy to the Jews in Juda and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel, [even] to them.
015	EZR	005	002	Then rose up Zorobabel the [son] of Salathiel, and Jesus the son of Josedec, and began to build the house of God that was in Jerusalem: and with them [were] the prophets of God assisting them.
015	EZR	005	003	At the same time came there upon them Thanthanai, the governor on this side the river, and Satharbuzanai, and their fellow-servants, and spoke thus to them, Who has ordained a decree for you to build this house, and to [provide] this preparation?
015	EZR	005	004	Then they spoke thus to them, What are the names of the men that build this city?
015	EZR	005	005	But the eyes of God were upon the captivity of Juda, and they did not cause them to cease till the decree was brought to Darius; and then was sent by the tribute-gatherer concerning this
015	EZR	005	006	the copy of a letter, which Thanthanai, the governor of the part on this side the river, and Satharbuzanai, and their fellow-servants the Apharsachaeans who were on this side of the river, sent to king Darius.
015	EZR	005	007	They sent an account to him, and thus it was written in it: All peace to king Darius.
015	EZR	005	008	Be it known to the king, that we went into the land of Judea, to the house of the great God; and it is building with choice stones, and they are laying timbers in the walls, and that work is prospering, and goes on favorably in their hands.
015	EZR	005	009	Then we asked those elders, and thus we said to them, Who gave you the order to build this house, and to [provide] this preparation?
015	EZR	005	010	And we asked them their names, [in order] to declare [them] to thee, so as to write to thee the names of their leading men.
015	EZR	005	011	And they answered us thus, saying, We [are] the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and we [are] building the house which had been built many years before this, and a great king of Israel built it, and established it for them.
015	EZR	005	012	But after that our fathers provoked the God of heaven, he gave them into the hands of Nabuchodonosor the Chaldean, king of Babylon, and he destroyed this house, and carried the people captive to Babylon.
015	EZR	005	013	And in the first year of king Cyrus, Cyrus the king made a decree that this house of God should be built.
015	EZR	005	014	And the gold and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nabuchodonosor brought out from the house that was in Jerusalem, and carried them into the temple of the king, them did king Cyrus bring out from the temple of the king, and gave them to Sabanasar the treasurer, who was over the treasurer;
015	EZR	005	015	and said to him, Take all the vessels, and go, put them in the house that is in Jerusalem in their place.
015	EZR	005	016	Then that Sabanazar came, and laid the foundations of the house of God in Jerusalem: and from that time even until now it has been building, and has not been finished.
015	EZR	005	017	And now, if it [seem] good to the king, lest search be made in the treasure-house of the king at Babylon, that thou mayest know [if it be] that a decree was made by king Cyrus to build that house of God that was in Jerusalem, and let the king send to us when he has learnt concerning this [matter].
015	EZR	006	001	Then Darius the king made a decree, and caused a search to be made in the record-offices, where the treasure is stored in Babylon.
015	EZR	006	002	And there was found in the city, in the palace, a volume, and this was the record written in it.
015	EZR	006	003	In the first year of king Cyrus, Cyrus the king made a decree concerning the holy house of God that was in Jerusalem, [saying,]Let the house be built, and the place where they sacrifice the sacrifices. (Also he appointed its elevation, in height sixty cubits; its breadth [was] of sixty cubits.)
015	EZR	006	004	And [let there be] three strong layers of stone, and one layer of timber; and the expense shall be paid out of the house of the king.
015	EZR	006	005	And the silver and the gold vessels of the house of God, which Nabuchodonosor carried off from the house that was in Jerusalem, and carried to Babylon, let them even be given, and be carried to the temple that is in Jerusalem, and put in the place where they were set in the house of God.
015	EZR	006	006	Now, ye rulers beyond the river, Satharbuzanai, and their fellow-servants the Apharsachaeans, who [are] on the other side of the river, give [these things], keeping far from that place.
015	EZR	006	007	Now let alone the work of the house of God: let the rulers of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build that house of God on its place.
015	EZR	006	008	Also a decree has been made by me, if haply ye may do somewhat in concert with the elders of the Jews for the building of that house of God: to wit, out of the king's property, [even] the tributes beyond the river, let there be money to defray the expenses carefully granted to those men, so that they be not hindered.
015	EZR	006	009	And whatever need [there may be], ye shall give both the young of bulls and rams, and lambs for whole-burnt-offerings to the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, oil: —let it be given them according to the word of the priests that are in Jerusalem, day by day whatsoever they shall ask;
015	EZR	006	010	that they may offer sweet savours to the God of heaven, and that they may pray for the life of the king and his sons.
015	EZR	006	011	And a decree has been made by me, that every man who shall alter this word, timber shall be pulled down from his house, and let him be lifted up and slain upon it, and his house shall be confiscated.
015	EZR	006	012	And may the God whose name dwells there, overthrow every king and people who shall stretch out his hand to alter or destroy the house of God which is in Jerusalem. I Darius have made a decree; let it be diligently [attended to].
015	EZR	006	013	Then Thanthanai the governor on this side beyond the river, Satharbuzanai, and his fellow-servants, according to that which king Darius sent, so they did diligently.
015	EZR	006	014	And the elders of the Jews and the Levites built, at the prophecy of Aggaeus the prophet, and Zacharias the son of Addo: and they built up, and finished [it], by the decree of the God of Israel, and by the decree of Cyrus, and Darius, and Arthasastha, kings of the Persians.
015	EZR	006	015	And they finished this house by the third day of the month Adar, which is the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king.
015	EZR	006	016	And the children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the rest of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication of the house of God with gladness.
015	EZR	006	017	And they offered for the dedication of the house of God a hundred calves, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs, twelve kids of the goats for a sin-offering for all Israel, according to the number of the tribes of Israel.
015	EZR	006	018	And they set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in their separate orders, for the services of God in Jerusalem, according to the writing of the book of Moses.
015	EZR	006	019	And the children of the captivity kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month.
015	EZR	006	020	For the priests and Levites were purified, all were clean to a man, and they slew the passover for all the children of the captivity, and for their brethren the priests, and for themselves.
015	EZR	006	021	And the children of Israel ate the passover, [even] they that were of the captivity, and every one who separated himself to them from the uncleanness of the nations of the land, to seek the Lord God of Israel.
015	EZR	006	022	and they kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with gladness, because the Lord made them glad, and he turned the heart of the king of Assyria to them, to strengthen their hands in the works of the house of the God of Israel.
015	EZR	007	001	Now after these things, in the reign of Arthasastha king of the Persians, came up Esdras the son of Saraias, the son of Azarias, the son of Chelcias,
015	EZR	007	002	the son of Selum, the son of Sadduc, the son of Achitob,
015	EZR	007	003	the son of Samarias, the son of Esria, the son of Mareoth,
015	EZR	007	004	the son of Zaraia, the son of Ozias, the son of Bokki,
015	EZR	007	005	the son of Abisue, the son of Phinees, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the first priest.
015	EZR	007	006	This Esdras went up out of Babylon; and he was a ready scribe in the law of Moses, which the Lord God of Israel gave: and the king gave him [leave], for the hand of the Lord his God was upon him in all things which he sought.
015	EZR	007	007	And [some] of the children of Israel went up, and [some] of the priests, and of the Levites, and the singers, and the door-keepers, and the Nathinim, to Jerusalem, in the seventh year of Arthasastha the king.
015	EZR	007	008	And they came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, this [was] the seventh year of the king.
015	EZR	007	009	For in the first [day] of the first month he began the going up from Babylon, and in the first day of the fifth month, they came to Jerusalem, for the good hand of his God was upon him.
015	EZR	007	010	For Esdras had determined in his heart to seek the law, and to do and teach the ordinances and judgments in Israel.
015	EZR	007	011	And this [is] the copy of the order which Arthasastha gave to Esdras the priest, the scribe of the book of the words of the commandments of the Lord, and of his ordinances to Israel.
015	EZR	007	012	Arthasastha, king of kings, to Esdras, the scribe of the law of the Lord God of heaven, Let the order and the answer be accomplished.
015	EZR	007	013	A decree is made by me, that every one who is willing in my kingdom of the people of Israel, and of the priests and Levites, to go to Jerusalem, [be permitted] to go with thee.
015	EZR	007	014	[One] has been sent from the king and the seven councillors, to visit Judea and Jerusalem, according to the law of their God that is in thine hand.
015	EZR	007	015	And for the house of the Lord [there have been sent] silver and gold, which the king and the councillors have freely given to the God of Israel, who dwells in Jerusalem.
015	EZR	007	016	And all the silver and gold, whatsoever thou shalt find in all the land of Babylon, with the freewill-offering of the people, and the priests that offer freely for the house of God which is in Jerusalem.
015	EZR	007	017	And as for every one that arrives [there], speedily order him by this letter [to bring] calves, rams, lambs, and their meat-offerings, and their drink-offerings; and thou shalt offer them on the altar of the house of your God which is in Jerusalem.
015	EZR	007	018	And whatever it shall seem good to thee and to thy brethren to do with the rest of the silver and the gold, do as it is pleasing to your God.
015	EZR	007	019	And deliver the vessels that are given thee for the service of the house of God, before God in Jerusalem.
015	EZR	007	020	And as to the rest of the need of the house of thy God, thou shalt give from the king's treasure-houses,
015	EZR	007	021	and from me, whatever it shall seem [good] to thee to give. I king Arthasastha have made a decree for all the treasuries that are in the [country] beyond the river, that whatever Esdras the priest and scribe of the God of heaven may ask you, it shall be done speedily,
015	EZR	007	022	to [the amount of] a hundred talents of silver, and a hundred measures of wheat, and a hundred baths of wine, and a hundred baths of oil, and salt without reckoning.
015	EZR	007	023	Let whatever is in the decree of the God of heaven, be done: take heed lest any one make an attack on the house of the God of heaven, lest at any time there shall be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons.
015	EZR	007	024	Also this has been declared to you, with respect to all the priests, and Levites, the singers, porters, Nathinim and ministers of the house of God, let no tribute be [paid] to thee; thou shalt not have power to oppress them.
015	EZR	007	025	And thou, Esdras, as the wisdom of God [is] in thy hand, appoint scribes and judges, that they may judge for all the people beyond the river, all that know the law of the Lord thy God; and ye shall make it known to him that knows not.
015	EZR	007	026	And whosoever shall not do the law of God, and the law of the king readily, judgment shall be taken upon him, whether for death or for chastisement, or for a fine of his property, or casting into prison.
015	EZR	007	027	Blessed [be] the Lord God of our fathers, who has put it thus into the heart of the king, to glorify the house of the Lord which is in Jerusalem;
015	EZR	007	028	and has given me favour in the eyes of the king, and of his councillors, and all the rulers of the king, the exalted ones. And I was strengthened according to the good hand of God upon me, and I gathered chief men of Israel to go up with me.
015	EZR	008	001	And these [are] the heads of their families, the leaders that went up with me in the reign of Arthasastha the king of Babylon.
015	EZR	008	002	Of the sons of Phinees; Gerson: of the sons of Ithamar; Daniel: of the sons of David; Attus.
015	EZR	008	003	Of the sons of Sachania, and the sons of Phoros; Zacharias: and with him a company [of] a hundred and fifty.
015	EZR	008	004	Of the sons of Phaath-Moab; Eliana the son of Saraia, and with him two hundred that were males.
015	EZR	008	005	And of the sons of Zathoes; Sechenias the son of Aziel, and with him three hundred males.
015	EZR	008	006	And of the sons of Adin; Obeth the son of Jonathan, and with him fifty males.
015	EZR	008	007	And of the sons of Elam; Isaeas the son of Athelia, and with him seventy males.
015	EZR	008	008	And of the sons of Saphatia; Zabadias the son of Michael, and with him eighty males.
015	EZR	008	009	And of the sons of Joab; Abadia the son of Jeiel, and with him two hundred and eighteen males.
015	EZR	008	010	And of the sons of Baani; Selimuth the son of Josephia, and with him a hundred and sixty males.
015	EZR	008	011	And of the sons of Babi; Zacharias the son of Babi, and with him twenty-eight males.
015	EZR	008	012	And of the sons of Asgad; Joanan the son of Accatan, and with him a hundred and ten males.
015	EZR	008	013	And of the sons of Adonicam [were the] last, and these [were] their names, Eliphalat, Jeel, and Samaea, and with them sixty males.
015	EZR	008	014	And of the sons of Baguae, Uthai, and Zabud, and with him seventy males.
015	EZR	008	015	And I gathered them to the river that comes to Evi, and we encamped there three days: and I reviewed the people and the priests, and found none of the sons of Levi there.
015	EZR	008	016	And I sent men of understanding to Eleazar, to Ariel, to Semeias, and to Alonam, and to Jarib, and to Elnatham, and to Nathan, and to Zacharias, and to Mesollam, and to Joarim, and to Elnathan.
015	EZR	008	017	And I forwarded them to the rulers with the money of the place, and I put words in their mouth to speak to their brethren the Athinim with the money of the place, that they should bring us singers for the house of our God.
015	EZR	008	018	And they came to us, as the good hand of our God was upon us, even a man of understanding of the sons of Mooli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel, and at the commencement came his sons and his brethren, eighteen.
015	EZR	008	019	And Asebia, and Isaia of the sons of Merari, his brethren and his sons, twenty.
015	EZR	008	020	And of the Nathinim; whom David and the princes had appointed for the service of the Levites [there were] two hundred and twenty Nathinim; all were gathered by [their] names.
015	EZR	008	021	And I proclaimed there a fast, at the river Aue, that [we] should humble ourselves before our God, to seek of him a straight way for us, and for our children, and for all our property.
015	EZR	008	022	For I was ashamed to ask of the king a guard and horsemen to save us from the enemy in the way: for we had spoken to the king, saying, The hand of our God [is] upon all that seek him, for good; but his power and his wrath [are] upon all that forsake him.
015	EZR	008	023	So we fasted, and asked of our God concerning this; and he hearkened to us.
015	EZR	008	024	And I gave charge to twelve of the chiefs of the priests, to Saraia, to Asabia, and ten of their brethren with them.
015	EZR	008	025	And I weighed to them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of the first-fruits of the house of our God, which the king, and his councillors, and his princes, and all Israel that were found, had dedicated.
015	EZR	008	026	I even weighed into their hands six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and a hundred silver vessels, and a hundred talents of gold;
015	EZR	008	027	and twenty golden bowls, [weighing] about a thousand drachms, and superior vessels of fine shining brass, [precious] as gold.
015	EZR	008	028	And I said to them, Ye [are] holy to the Lord; and the vessels [are] holy; and the silver and the gold are freewill-offerings to the Lord God of our fathers.
015	EZR	008	029	Be watchful and keep them, until ye weigh [them] before the chief priests and the Levites, and the chiefs of families in Jerusalem, at the chambers of the house of the Lord.
015	EZR	008	030	So the priests and the Levites took the weight of the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, to bring to Jerusalem into the house of our God.
015	EZR	008	031	And we departed from the river of Aue on the twelfth day of the first month, to come to Jerusalem: and the hand of our God was upon us, and delivered us from the hand of the enemy and adversary in the way.
015	EZR	008	032	And we came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days.
015	EZR	008	033	And it came to pass on the fourth day that we weighed the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, in the house of our God, into the hand of Merimoth the son of Uria the priest; and with him [was] Eleazar the son of Phinees, and with them Jozabad the son of Jesus, and Noadia the son of Banaia, the Levites.
015	EZR	008	034	All things [were reckoned] by number and weight, and the whole weight was written [down].
015	EZR	008	035	At that time the children of the banishment that came from the captivity offered whole-burnt-offerings to the God of Israel, twelve calves for all Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven lambs, twelve goats for a sin-offering; all whole-burnt-offerings to the Lord.
015	EZR	008	036	And they gave the king's mandate to the king's lieutenants, and the governors beyond the river: and they honoured the people and the house of God.
015	EZR	009	001	And when these things were finished, the princes drew near to me, saying, The people of Israel, and the priests, and the Levites, have not separated themselves from the people of the lands in their abominations, [even] the Chananite, the Ethite, the Pherezite, the Jebusite, the Ammonite, the Moabite, and the Moserite and the Amorite.
015	EZR	009	002	For they have taken of their daughters for themselves and their sons; and the holy seed has passed among the nations of the lands, and the hand of the rulers [has been] first in this transgression.
015	EZR	009	003	And when I heard this thing, I rent my garments, and trembled, and plucked [some] of the hairs of my head and of my beard, and sat down mourning.
015	EZR	009	004	Then there assembled to me all that followed the word of the God of Israel, on account of the transgression of the captivity; and I remained mourning until the evening sacrifice.
015	EZR	009	005	And at the evening sacrifice I rose up from my humiliation; and when I had rent my garments, then I trembled, and I bow myself on my knees, and spread out my hands to the Lord God,
015	EZR	009	006	and I said, O Lord, I am ashamed and confounded, O my God, to lift up my face to thee: for our transgressions have abounded over our head, and our trespasses have increased even to heaven.
015	EZR	009	007	From the days of our fathers we have been in a great trespass until this day: and because of our iniquities we, and our kings, and our children, have been delivered into the hand of the kings of the Gentiles by the sword, and by captivity, and by spoil, and with shame of our face, as at this day.
015	EZR	009	008	And now our God has dealt mercifully with us, so as to leave us to escape, and to give us an establishment in the place of his sanctuary, to enlighten our eyes, and to give a little quickening in our servitude.
015	EZR	009	009	For we are slaves, yet in our servitude the Lord our God has not deserted us; and he has extended favour to us in the sight of the kings of the Persians, to give us a quickening, that they should raise up the house of our God, and restore the desolate places of it, and to give us a fence in Juda and Jerusalem.
015	EZR	009	010	What shall we say, our God, after this? for we have forsaken thy commandments,
015	EZR	009	011	which thou hast given us by the hand of thy servants the prophets, saying, The land, into which ye go to inherit it, is a land subject to disturbance by the removal of the people of the nations for their abominations, wherewith they have filled it from one end to the other by their uncleanness.
015	EZR	009	012	And now give not your daughters to their sons, and take not of their daughters for your sons, neither shall ye seek their peace or their good for ever: that ye may be strong, and eat the good of the land, and transmit it as an inheritance to your children for ever.
015	EZR	009	013	And after all that is come upon us because of our evil deeds, and our great trespass, [it is clear] that there is none such as our God, for thou has lightly visited our iniquities, and given us deliverance;
015	EZR	009	014	whereas we have repeatedly broken thy commandments, and intermarried with the people of the lands: be not very angry with us to [our] utter destruction, so that there should be no remnant or escaping one.
015	EZR	009	015	O Lord God of Israel, thou [art] righteous; for we remain [yet] escaped, as at this day: behold, we [are] before thee in our trespasses: for we cannot stand before thee on this account.
015	EZR	010	001	So when Esdras [had] prayed, and when he [had] confessed, weeping and praying before the house of God, a very great assembly of Israel came together to him, men and women and youths; for the people wept, and wept aloud.
015	EZR	010	002	And Sechenias the son of Jeel, of the sons of Elam, answered and said to Esdras, We have broken covenant with our God, and have taken strange wives of the nations of the land: yet now there is patience [of hope] to Israel concerning this thing.
015	EZR	010	003	Now then let us make a covenant with our God, to put away all the wives, and their offspring, as thou shalt advise:
015	EZR	010	004	arise, and alarm them with the commands of our God; and let [it] be done according to the law. Rise up, for the matter [is] upon thee; and we [are] with thee: be strong and do.
015	EZR	010	005	Then Esdras arose, and caused the rulers, the priests, and Levites, and all Israel, to swear that they would do according to this word: and they swore.
015	EZR	010	006	And Esdras rose up from before the house of God, and went to the treasury of Joanan the son of Elisub; he even went thither: he ate no bread, and drank no water; for he mourned over the unfaithfulness [of them] of the captivity.
015	EZR	010	007	And they made proclamation throughout Juda and Jerusalem to all the children of the captivity, that they should assemble at Jerusalem, [saying],
015	EZR	010	008	Every one who shall not arrive within three days, as [is] the counsel of the rulers and the elders, all his substance shall be forfeited, and he shall be separated from the congregation of the captivity.
015	EZR	010	009	So all the men of Juda and Benjamin assembled at Jerusalem within the three days. This [was] the ninth month: on the twentieth day of the month all the people sat down in the street of the house of the Lord, because of their alarm concerning the word, and because of the storm.
015	EZR	010	010	And Esdras the priest arose, and said to them, Ye have broken covenant, and have taken strange wives, to add to the trespass of Israel.
015	EZR	010	011	Now therefore give praise to the Lord God of our fathers, and do that which is pleasing in his sight: and separate yourselves from the peoples of the land, and from the strange wives.
015	EZR	010	012	Then all the congregation answered and said, This thy word [is] powerful upon us to do it.
015	EZR	010	013	But the people [is] numerous, and the season [is] stormy, and there is no power to stand without, and the work is more than enough for one day or for two; for we have greatly sinned in this matter.
015	EZR	010	014	Let now our rulers stand, and for all those in our cities who have taken strange wives, let them come at appointed times, and with them elders from every several city, and judges, to turn away the fierce wrath of our God from us concerning this matter.
015	EZR	010	015	Only Jonathan the son of Asael, and Jazias the son of Thecoe [were] with me concerning this; and Mesollam, and Sabbathai the Levite helped them.
015	EZR	010	016	And the children of the captivity did thus: and Esdras the priest, and heads of families according to [their] house were separated, and all by their names, for they returned in the first day of the tenth month to search out the matter.
015	EZR	010	017	And they made an end with all the men who had taken strange wives by the first day of the first month.
015	EZR	010	018	And there were found [some] of the sons of the priests who had taken strange wives: of the sons of Jesus the son of Josedec, and his brethren; Maasia, and Eliezer, and Jarib, and Gadalia.
015	EZR	010	019	And they pledged themselves to put away their wives, and [offered] a ram of the flock for a trespass-offering because of their trespass.
015	EZR	010	020	And of the sons of Emmer; Anani, and Zabdia.
015	EZR	010	021	And of the sons of Eram; Masael, and Elia, and Samaia, and Jeel, and Ozia.
015	EZR	010	022	And of the sons of Phasur; Elionai, Maasia, and Ismael, and Nathanael, and Jozabad, and Elasa.
015	EZR	010	023	And of the Levites; Jozabad, and Samu, and Colia (he [is] Colitas,) and Phetheia, and Judas, and Eliezer.
015	EZR	010	024	And of the singers; Elisab: and of the porters; Solmen, and Telmen, and Oduth.
015	EZR	010	025	Also of Israel: of the sons of Phoros; Ramia, and Azia, and Melchia, and Meamin, and Eleazar, and Asabia, and Banaia.
015	EZR	010	026	And of the sons of Helam; Matthania, and Zacharia, and Jaiel, and Abdia, and Jarimoth, and Elia.
015	EZR	010	027	And of the sons of Zathua; Elionai, Elisub, Matthanai, and Armoth, and Zabad, and Oziza.
015	EZR	010	028	And of the sons of Babei; Joanan, Anania, and Zabu, and Thali.
015	EZR	010	029	And of the sons of Banui; Mosollam, Maluch, Adaias, Jasub, and Saluia, and Remoth.
015	EZR	010	030	And of the sons of Phaath Moab; Edne, and Chalel, and Banaia, Maasia, Matthania, Beseleel, and Banui, and Manasse.
015	EZR	010	031	And of the sons of Eram; Eliezer, Jesia, Melchia, Samaias, Semeon,
015	EZR	010	032	Benjamin, Baluch, Samaria.
015	EZR	010	033	And of the sons of Asem; Metthania, Matthatha, Zadab, Eliphalet, Jerami, Manasse, Semei.
015	EZR	010	034	And of the sons of Bani; Moodia, Amram, Uel,
015	EZR	010	035	Banaia, Badaia, Chelkia,
015	EZR	010	036	Uvania, Marimoth, Eliasiph,
015	EZR	010	037	Matthania, Matthanai:
015	EZR	010	038	and [so] did the children of Banui, and the children of Semei,
015	EZR	010	039	and Selemia, and Nathan, and Adaia,
015	EZR	010	040	Machadnabu, Sesei, Sariu,
015	EZR	010	041	Ezriel, and Selemia, and Samaria,
015	EZR	010	042	and Sellum, Amaria, Joseph.
015	EZR	010	043	Of the sons of Nabu; Jael, Matthanias, Zabad, Zebennas, Jadai, and Joel, and Banaia.
015	EZR	010	044	All these had taken strange wives, and had begotten sons of them.

# BOOK	016	NEH	Nehemiah	Nehemiah
016	NEH	001	001	The words of Neemias the son of Chelcia. And it came to pass in the month Chaseleu, of the twentieth year, that I was in Susan the palace.
016	NEH	001	002	And Anani, one of my brethren, came, he and [some] men of Juda; and I asked them concerning those that had escaped, who had been left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.
016	NEH	001	003	And they said to me, The remnant, [even] those that are left of the captivity, [are] there in the land, in great distress and reproach: and the walls of Jerusalem [are] thrown down, and its gates are burnt with fire.
016	NEH	001	004	And it came to pass, when I heard these words, [that] I sat down and wept, and mourned for [several] days, and continued fasting and praying before the God of heaven.
016	NEH	001	005	And I said, Nay, I pray thee, O Lord God of heaven, the mighty, the great and terrible, keeping thy covenant and mercy to them that love him, and to those that keep his commandments:
016	NEH	001	006	let now thine ear be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou mayest hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee at this time, this day [both] day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants, and make confession for the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against thee: both I and the house of my father have sinned.
016	NEH	001	007	We have altogether broken [covenant] with thee, and we have not kept the commandments, and the ordinances, and the judgments, which thou didst command thy servant Moses.
016	NEH	001	008	Remember, I pray thee, the word wherewith thou didst charge thy servant Moses, saying, If ye break covenant [with me], I will disperse you among the nations.
016	NEH	001	009	But if ye turn again to me, and keep my commandments, and do them; if ye should be scattered under the utmost [bound] of heaven, thence will I gather them, and I will bring them into the place which I have chosen to cause my name to dwell there.
016	NEH	001	010	Now they [are] thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast redeemed with thy great power, and with thy strong hand.
016	NEH	001	011	[Turn] not [away], I pray thee, O Lord, but let thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who desire to fear thy name: and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and cause him to find mercy in the sight of this man. Now I was the king's cup-bearer.
016	NEH	002	001	And it came to pass in the month Nisan of the twentieth year of king Arthasastha, that the wine was before me: and I took the wine, and gave [it] to the king: and there was not another before him.
016	NEH	002	002	And the king said to me, Why is thy countenance sad, and dost thou not control thyself? and now this is nothing but sorrow of heart. Then I was very much alarmed,
016	NEH	002	003	and I said to the king, Let the king live for ever: why should not my countenance be said, forasmuch as the city, even the home of the sepulchres of my fathers, has been laid waste, and her gates have been devoured with fire?
016	NEH	002	004	And the king said to me, For what dost thou ask thus? So I prayed to the God of heaven.
016	NEH	002	005	And I said to the king, If [it seem] good to the king, and if thy servant shall have found favour in thy sight, [I ask] that [thou] wouldest send him into Juda, to the city of the sepulchres of my fathers; then will I rebuild it.
016	NEH	002	006	And the king, and his concubine that sat next to him, said to me, For how long will thy journey be, and when wilt thou return? and [the proposal] was pleasing before the king, and he sent me away, and I appointed him a time.
016	NEH	002	007	And I said to the king, If [it seem] good to the king, let him give me letters to the governors beyond the river, so as to forward me till I come to Juda;
016	NEH	002	008	and a letter to Asaph the keeper of the garden which belongs to the king, that he may give me timber to cover the gates, and for the wall of the city, and for the house into which I shall enter. And the king gave to me, according as the good hand of God [was upon me].
016	NEH	002	009	And I came to the governors beyond the river, and I gave them the king's letters. (Now the king had sent with me captains of the army and horsemen.)
016	NEH	002	010	And Sanaballat the Aronite heard [it], and Tobia the servant, the Ammonite, and it was grievous to them that a man was come to seek good for the children of Israel.
016	NEH	002	011	So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.
016	NEH	002	012	And I rose up by night, I and a few men with me; and I told no man what God put into my heart to do with Israel; and there was no beast with me, except the beast which I rode upon.
016	NEH	002	013	And I went forth by the gate of the valley by night, and to the mouth of the well of fig trees, and to the dung-gate: and I mourned over the wall of Jerusalem which they were destroying, and her gates were devoured with fire.
016	NEH	002	014	And I passed on to the fountain gate, and to the king's pool; and there was no room for the beast to pass under me.
016	NEH	002	015	And I went up by the wall of the brook by night, and mourned over the wall, and passed through the gate of the valley, and returned.
016	NEH	002	016	And the sentinels knew not why I went, nor what I was doing; and until that time I told [it] not to the Jews, or to the priests, or to the nobles, or to the captains, or to the rest [of the men] who wrought the works.
016	NEH	002	017	Then I said to them, Ye see this evil, in which we are, how Jerusalem is desolate, and her gates have been set on fire: come, and let us build throughout the wall of Jerusalem, and we shall be no longer a reproach.
016	NEH	002	018	And I told them of the hand of God which was good upon me, also about the words of the king which he spoke to me: and I said, Let us arise and build. And their hands were strengthened for the good [work].
016	NEH	002	019	And Sanaballat the Aronite, and Tobia the servant, the Ammonite, and Gesam the Arabian, heard [it], and they laughed us to scorn, and came to us, and said, What [is] this thing that ye are doing? are ye revolting against the king?
016	NEH	002	020	And I answered them, and said to them, The God of heaven, he shall prosper us, and we his servants are pure, and we will build: but ye have no part, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem.
016	NEH	003	001	Then Eliasub the high priest, and his brethren the priests, rose up, and built the sheep-gate; they sanctified it, and set up the doors of it; even to the tower of the hundred they sanctified [it], to the tower of Anameel.
016	NEH	003	002	And [they builded] by the side of the men of Jericho, and by the side of the sons of Zacchur, the son of Amari.
016	NEH	003	003	And the sons of Asana built the fish-gate; they roofed it, and covered in its doors, and bolts, and bars.
016	NEH	003	004	And next to them [the order] reached to Ramoth the son of Uria, the son of Accos, and next to them Mosollam son of Barachias the son of Mazebel took [his] place: and next to them Sadoc the son of Baana took [his] place.
016	NEH	003	005	And next to them the Thecoim took [their] place; but the Adorim applied not their neck to their service.
016	NEH	003	006	And Joida the son of Phasec, and Mesulam son of Basodia, repaired the old gate; they covered it in, and set up its doors, and its bolts, and its bars.
016	NEH	003	007	And next to them repaired Maltias the Gabaonite, and Evaron the Meronothite, the men of Gabaon and Maspha, to the throne of the governor on this side the river.
016	NEH	003	008	And next to him Oziel the son of Arachias of the smiths, carried on the repairs: and next to them Ananias the son of one of the apothecaries repaired, and they finished Jerusalem to the broad wall.
016	NEH	003	009	And next to them repaired Raphaea the son of Sur, the ruler of half the district round about Jerusalem.
016	NEH	003	010	And next to them repaired Jedaia the son of Eromaph, and [that] in front of his house: and next to him repaired Attuth son of Asabania.
016	NEH	003	011	And next [to him] repaired Melchias son of Heram, and Asub son of Phaat Moab, even to the tower of the furnaces.
016	NEH	003	012	And next to him repaired Sallum the son of Alloes, the ruler of half the district round about Jerusalem, he and his daughters.
016	NEH	003	013	Anun and the inhabitants of Zano repaired the gate of the valley: they built it, and set up its doors, and its bolts, and its bars, and a thousand cubits of the wall as far as the dung-gate.
016	NEH	003	014	And Melchia the son of Rechab, the ruler of the district round about Beth-accharim, repaired the dung-gate, he and his sons; and they covered it, and set up its doors, and its bolts, and its bars.
016	NEH	003	015	But Solomon the son of Choleze repaired the gate of the fountain, the ruler of part of Maspha; he built it, and covered it, and set up its doors and its bars, and the wall of the pool of the skins by the meadow of the king, and as far as the steps that lead down from the city of David.
016	NEH	003	016	After him repaired Neemias son of Azabuch, ruler of half the district round about Bethsur, as far as the garden of David's sepulchre, and as far as the artificial pool, and as far as the house of the mighty men.
016	NEH	003	017	After him repaired the Levites, [even] Raum the son of Bani: next to him repaired Asabia, ruler of half the district round about Keila, in his district.
016	NEH	003	018	And after him repaired his brethren, Benei son of Enadad, ruler of half the district round about Keila.
016	NEH	003	019	And next to him repaired Azur the son of Joshua, ruler of Masphai, another portion of the tower of ascent, where it meets the corner.
016	NEH	003	020	After him repaired Baruch the son of Zabu, a second portion, from the corner as far as the door of the house of Eliasub the high priest.
016	NEH	003	021	After him repaired Meramoth the son of Uria the son of Accos, a second part from the door of the house of Eliasub, to the end of the house of Eliasub.
016	NEH	003	022	And after him repaired the priests, the men of Ecchechar.
016	NEH	003	023	And after him repaired Benjamin and Asub over against their house: and after him repaired Azarias son of Maasias the son of Ananias, [the parts] near to his house.
016	NEH	003	024	After him repaired Bani the son of Adad, another portion from the house of Azaria as far as the corner and to the turning,
016	NEH	003	025	of Phalach the son of Uzai, opposite the corner, and [where is] also the tower that projects from the king's house, even the upper one of the prison-house: and after him [repaired] Phadaea the son of Phoros.
016	NEH	003	026	And the Nathinim dwelt in Ophal, as far as the garden of the water-gate eastward, and [there is] the projecting tower.
016	NEH	003	027	And after them the Thecoim repaired, another portion opposite the great projecting tower, even as far as the wall of Ophla.
016	NEH	003	028	The priests repaired above the horse-gate, [every] man over against his own house.
016	NEH	003	029	And after him Sadduc the son of Emmer repaired opposite his own house: and after him repaired Samaea son of Sechenia, guard of the east-gate.
016	NEH	003	030	After him repaired Anania son of Selemia, and Anom, the sixth son of Seleph, another portion: after him Mesulam the son of Barachia repaired over against his treasury.
016	NEH	003	031	After him repaired Melchia the son of Sarephi as far as the house of the Nathinim, and the chapmen over against the gate of Maphecad, and as far as the steps of the corner.
016	NEH	003	032	And between [that and] the sheep-gate the smiths and chapmen repaired.
016	NEH	004	001	Now it came to pass, when Sanaballat heard that we were building the wall, that it was grievous to him, and he was very angry, and railed against the Jews.
016	NEH	004	002	And he said before his brethren (that [is] the army of the Samaritans) [Is it true] that these Jews are building their city? do they indeed offer sacrifices? will they prevail? and will they this day restore the stones, after they have been burnt and made a heap of rubbish?
016	NEH	004	003	And Tobias the Ammanite came near to him, and said to them, Do they sacrifice or eat in their place? shall not a fox go up and pull down their wall of stones?
016	NEH	004	004	Hear, O our God, for we have become a scorn; and return thou their reproach upon their head, and make them a scorn in a land of captivity,
016	NEH	004	005	and do not cover [their] iniquity.
016	NEH	004	007	But it came to pass, when Sanaballat and Tobia, and the Arabians, and the Ammanites, heard that the building of the walls of Jerusalem was advancing, [and] that the breaches began to be stopped, that it appeared very grievous to them.
016	NEH	004	008	And all of them assembled together, to come to fight against Jerusalem, and to destroy it utterly.
016	NEH	004	009	So we prayed to our God and set watchmen against them day and night, because of them.
016	NEH	004	010	And Juda said, The strength of the enemies is broken, yet [there is] much rubbish, and we shall not be able to build the wall.
016	NEH	004	011	And they that afflicted us said, They shall not know, and they shall not see, until we come into the midst of them, and slay them, and cause the work to cease.
016	NEH	004	012	And it came to pass, when the Jews who lived near them came, that they said to us, They are coming up against us from every quarter.
016	NEH	004	013	So I set [men] in the lowest part of the place behind the wall in the lurking-places, I even set the people according to their families, with their swords, their spears, and their bows.
016	NEH	004	014	And I looked, and arose, and said to the nobles, and to the captains, and to the rest of the people, Be not afraid of them: remember our great and terrible God, and fight for your brethren, your sons, your daughters, your wives, and your houses.
016	NEH	004	015	And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was made known to us, and God had frustrated their counsel, that we all returned to the wall, [every] man to his work.
016	NEH	004	016	And it came to pass from that day [that] half of them that had been driven forth, wrought the work, and half of them kept guard; and [there were] spears, and shields, and bows, and breast-plates, and rulers behind the whole house of Juda,
016	NEH	004	017	even of them that were building the wall: —and those who carried the burdens [were] under arms: [each] with one hand wrought his work, and with the other held his dart.
016	NEH	004	018	And the builders [wrought] each man having his sword girt upon his loins, and so they built: and the trumpeter with his trumpet next to him.
016	NEH	004	019	And I said to the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, The work [is] great and abundant, and we are dispersed upon the wall, each at a great distance from his brother.
016	NEH	004	020	In whatsoever place ye shall hear the sound of the cornet, thither gather yourselves together to us; and our God shall fight for us.
016	NEH	004	021	So we [continued] labouring at the work: and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning until the stars appeared.
016	NEH	004	022	And at that time I said to the people, Lodge ye every man with his servant in the midst of Jerusalem, and let the night be a watch-time to you, and the day a work-time.
016	NEH	004	023	And I was [there], and the watchmen behind me, and there was not a man of us that put off his garments.
016	NEH	005	001	And the cry of the people and their wives [was] great against their brethren the Jews.
016	NEH	005	002	And some said, We [are] numerous with our sons and our daughters; so we will take corn, and eat, and live.
016	NEH	005	003	And some said, [As to] our fields and vineyards and houses, let us pledge [them], and we will take corn, and eat.
016	NEH	005	004	And some said, We have borrowed money for the king's tributes: —our fields, and our vineyards, and houses [are pledged].
016	NEH	005	005	And now our flesh [is] as the flesh of our brethren, our children [are] as their children: yet, behold, we are reducing our sons and our daughters to slavery, and some of our daughters are enslaved: and there is no power of our hands, for our fields and our vineyards [belong] to the nobles.
016	NEH	005	006	And I was much grieved as I heard their cry and these words.
016	NEH	005	007	And my heart took counsel within me, and I contended against the nobles, and the princes, and I said to them, Should every man demand of his brother what ye demand? And I appointed against them a great assembly,
016	NEH	005	008	and I said to them, We of our free-will have redeemed our brethren the Jews that were sold to the Gentiles; and do ye sell your brethren? and shall they be delivered to us? And they were silent, and found no answer.
016	NEH	005	009	And I said, The thing which ye do [is] not good; ye will not so walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the Gentiles our enemies.
016	NEH	005	010	Both my brethren, and my acquaintances, and I, have lent them money and corn: let us now leave off this exaction.
016	NEH	005	011	Restore to them, I pray, as at this day, their fields, and their vineyards, and their olive-yards, and their houses, and bring forth to them corn and wine and oil of the money.
016	NEH	005	012	And they said, We will restore, and we will not exact of them; we will do thus as thou sayest. Then I called the priests, and bound them by oath to do according to this word.
016	NEH	005	013	And I shook out my garment, and said, So may God shake out every man who shall not keep to this word, from his house, and from his labours, he shall be even thus shaken out, as an outcast and empty. And all the congregation said, Amen, and they praised the Lord: and the people did this thing.
016	NEH	005	014	From the day that he charged me to be their ruler in the land of Juda, from the twentieth year even to the thirty-second year of Arthasastha, twelve years, I and my brethren ate not [provision] extorted from them.
016	NEH	005	015	But as for the former acts of extortion wherein [those who were] before me oppressed them, they even took of them their last money, forty didrachms for bread and wine; and the [very] outcasts of them exercised authority over the people: but I did not so, because of the fear of God.
016	NEH	005	016	Also in the work of the wall I treated them not with rigor, I bought not land: and all that were gathered together [came] thither to the work.
016	NEH	005	017	And the Jews, to [the number of] a hundred and fifty men, besides those coming to us from the nations round about, [were] at my table.
016	NEH	005	018	And there came [to me] for one day one calf, and I had six choice sheep and a goat; and every ten days wine in abundance of all sorts: yet with these I required not the bread of extortion, because the bondage was heavy upon this people.
016	NEH	005	019	Remember me, O God, for good, [in] all that I have done to this people.
016	NEH	006	001	Now it came to pass, when Sanaballat, and Tobias, and Gesam the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had built the wall, and [that] there was no opening left therein; ([but] hitherto I had not set up the doors on the gates;)
016	NEH	006	002	that Sanaballat and Gesam sent to me, saying, Come and let us meet together in the villages in the plain of Ono. But they [were] plotting to do me mischief.
016	NEH	006	003	So I sent messengers to them, saying, I am doing a great work, and I shall not be able to come down, lest the work should cease: as soon as I shall have finished it, I will come down to you.
016	NEH	006	004	And they sent to me [again] to this effect; and I sent them [word] accordingly.
016	NEH	006	005	Then Sanaballat sent his servant to me with an open letter in his hand.
016	NEH	006	006	And in it was written, It has been reported among the Gentiles that thou and the Jews are planning to revolt: therefore thou art building the wall, and thou wilt be a king to them.
016	NEH	006	007	And moreover thou has appointed prophets to thyself, that thou mightest dwell in Jerusalem as a king over Juda: and now these words will be reported to the king. Now then, come, let us take counsel together.
016	NEH	006	008	And I sent to him, saying, It has not happened according to these words, [even] as thou sayest, for thou framest them falsely out of thy heart.
016	NEH	006	009	For all were trying to alarm us, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from this work, and it shall not be done. Now therefore I have strengthened my hands.
016	NEH	006	010	And I came into the house of Semei the son of Dalaia the Son of Metabeel, and he was shut up; and he said, Let us assemble together in the house of God, in the midst of it, and let us shut the doors of it; for they are coming by night to slay thee.
016	NEH	006	011	And I said, Who is the man that shall enter into the house, that he may live?
016	NEH	006	012	And I observed, and, behold, God had not sent him, for the prophecy was a fable [devised] against me:
016	NEH	006	013	and Tobias and Sanaballat had hired against me a multitude, that I might be frightened, and do this, and sin, and become to them an ill name, that they might reproach me.
016	NEH	006	014	Remember, O God, Tobias and Sanaballat, according to these their deeds, and the prophetess Noadia, and the rest of the prophets who tried to alarm me.
016	NEH	006	015	So the wall was finished on the twenty-fifth day of the [month] Elul, in fifty-two days.
016	NEH	006	016	And it came to pass, when all our enemies heard [of it], that all the nations round about us feared, and great alarm fell upon them, and they knew that it was of our God that this work should be finished.
016	NEH	006	017	And in those days letters came to Tobias from many nobles of Juda, and those of Tobias came to them.
016	NEH	006	018	For many in Juda were bound to him by oath, because he was son-in-law of Sechenias the son of Herae; and Jonan his son had taken the daughter of Mesulam the son of Barachia to wife.
016	NEH	006	019	And they reported his words to me, and carried out my words to him: and Tobias sent letters to terrify me.
016	NEH	007	001	And it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed,
016	NEH	007	002	that I gave charge to Ananias my brother, and Ananias the ruler of the palace, over Jerusalem: for he was a true man, and one that feared God beyond many.
016	NEH	007	003	And I said to them, The gates of Jerusalem shall not be opened till sunrise; and while they are still watching, let the doors be shut, and bolted; and set watches of them that dwell in Jerusalem, [every] man at his post, and [every] man over against his house.
016	NEH	007	004	Now the city [was] wide and large; and the people [were] few in it, and the houses were not built.
016	NEH	007	005	And God put [it] into my heart, and I gathered the nobles, and the rulers, and the people, into companies: and I found a register of the company that came up first, and I found written in it as follows:
016	NEH	007	006	Now these [are] the children of the country, that came up from captivity, of the number which Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon carried away, and they returned to Jerusalem and to Juda, [every] man to his city;
016	NEH	007	007	with Zorobabel, and Jesus, and Neemia, Azaria, and Reelma, Naemani, Mardochaeus, Balsan, Maspharath, Esdra, Boguia, Inaum, Baana, Masphar, men of the people of Israel.
016	NEH	007	008	The children of Phoros, two thousand one hundred and seventy-two.

016	NEH	007	010	The children of Era, six hundred and fifty-two.

016	NEH	007	020	The children of Edin, six hundred and fifty-five.

016	NEH	007	038	The children of Sanana, three thousand nine hundred and thirty.
016	NEH	007	039	The priests; the sons of Jodae, [pertaining] to the house of Jesus, nine hundred and seventy-three.

016	NEH	007	041	The children of Phaseur, one thousand two hundred and forty-seven.
016	NEH	007	042	The children of Eram, a thousand and seventeen.
016	NEH	007	043	The Levites; the children of Jesus the son of Cadmiel, with the children of Uduia, seventy-four.
016	NEH	007	044	The singers; the children of Asaph, a hundred and forty-eight.
016	NEH	007	045	The porters; the children of Salum, the children of Ater, the children of Telmon, the children of Acub, the children of Atita, the children of Sabi, a hundred and thirty-eight.

016	NEH	007	051	the children of Gezam, the children of Ozi, the children of Phese,
016	NEH	007	052	the children of Besi, the children of Meinon, the children of Nephosasi,
016	NEH	007	053	the children of Bacbuc, the children of Achipha, the children of Arur,
016	NEH	007	054	the children of Basaloth, the children of Mida, the children of Adasan,
016	NEH	007	055	the children of Barcue, the children of Sisarath, the children of Thema,
016	NEH	007	056	the children of Nisia, the children of Atipha.
016	NEH	007	057	The children of the servants of Solomon; the children of Sutei, the children of Sapharat, the children of Pherida,

016	NEH	007	059	the children of Saphatia, the children of Ettel, the children of Phacarath, the children of Sabaim, the children of Emim.
016	NEH	007	060	All the Nathinim, and children of the servants of Solomon, [were] three hundred and ninety-two.
016	NEH	007	061	And these went up from Thelmeleth, Thelaresa, Charub, Eron, Jemer: but they could not declare the houses of their families, or their seed, whether they were of Israel.
016	NEH	007	062	The children of Dalaia, the children of Tobia, the children of Necoda, six hundred and forty-two.
016	NEH	007	063	And of the priests; the children of Ebia, the children of Acos, the children of Berzelli, for they took wives of the daughters of Berzelli the Galaadite, and they were called by their name.
016	NEH	007	064	These sought the pedigree of their company, and it was not found, and they were removed [as polluted] from the priesthood.
016	NEH	007	065	And the Athersastha said, that they should not eat of the most holy things, until a priest should stand up to give light.
016	NEH	007	066	And all the congregation was about forty-two thousand three hundred and sixty,
016	NEH	007	067	besides their men-servants and their maid-servants: these were seven thousand three hundred and thirty seven: and the singing-men and singing-women, two hundred and forty-five.
016	NEH	007	069	Two thousand seven hundred asses.
016	NEH	007	070	And part of the heads of families gave into the treasury to Neemias for the work a thousand pieces of gold, fifty bowls, and thirty priests' [garments].
016	NEH	007	071	And [some] of the heads of families gave into the treasuries of the work, twenty thousand pieces of gold, and two thousand three hundred pounds of silver.
016	NEH	007	072	And the rest of the people gave twenty thousand pieces of gold, and two thousand two hundred pounds of silver, and sixty-seven priests' [garments].
016	NEH	007	073	And the priests, and Levites, and porters, and singers, and [some] of the people, and the Nathinim, and all Israel, dwelt in their cities.
016	NEH	008	001	And the seventh month arrived, and the children of Israel [were settled] in their cities; and all the people were gathered as one man to the broad place before the water-gate, and they told Esdras the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses, which the Lord commanded Israel.
016	NEH	008	002	So Esdras the priest brought the law before the congregation both of men and women, and every one who had understanding [was present] to hearken, on the first day of the seventh month.
016	NEH	008	003	And he read in it from the time of sun-rise to the middle of the day, before the men and the women; and they understood [it], and the ears of all the people [were attentive] to the book of the law.
016	NEH	008	004	And Esdras the scribe stood on a wooden stage, and there stood next to him Mattathias, and Samaeas, and Ananias, and Urias, and Chelcia, and Massia, on his right hand; and on his left Phadaeas, and Misael, and Melchias, and Asom, and Asabadma, and Zacharias, and Mesollam.
016	NEH	008	005	And Esdras opened the book before all the people, for he was above the people; and it came to pass when he had opened it, [that] all the people stood.
016	NEH	008	006	And Esdras blessed the Lord, the great God: and all the people answered, and said, Amen, lifting up their hands: and they bowed down and worshipped the Lord with their face to the ground.
016	NEH	008	007	And Jesus and Banaias and Sarabias instructed the people in the law, and the people [stood] in their place.
016	NEH	008	008	And they read in the book of the law of God, and Esdras taught, and instructed them distinctly in the knowledge of the Lord, and the people understood [the law] in the reading.
016	NEH	008	009	And Neemias, and Esdras the priest and scribe, and the Levites, and they that instructed the people, spoke and said to all the people, It is a holy day to the Lord our God; do not mourn, nor weep. For all the people wept when they heard the words of the law.
016	NEH	008	010	And [the governor] said to them, Go, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions to them that have nothing; for the day is holy to our Lord: and faint not, for the Lord is our strength.
016	NEH	008	011	And the Levites caused all the people to be silent, saying, Be silent, for [it is] a holy day, and despond not.
016	NEH	008	012	So all the people departed to eat, and to drink, and to send portions, and to make great mirth, for they understood the words which he made known to them.
016	NEH	008	013	And on the second day the heads of families assembled with all the people, [also] the priests and Levites, to Esdras the scribe, to attend to all the words of the law.
016	NEH	008	014	And they found written in the law which the Lord commanded Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in booths, in the feast in the seventh month:
016	NEH	008	015	and that they should sound with trumpets in all their cities, and in Jerusalem. And Esdras said, Go forth to the mountain, and bring branches of olive, and branches of cypress trees, and branches of myrtle, and branches of palm trees, and branches of [every] thick tree, to make booths, according to that which was written.
016	NEH	008	016	And the people went forth, and brought [them], and made booths for themselves, each one upon his roof, and in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the streets of the city, and as far as the gate of Ephraim.
016	NEH	008	017	And all the congregation who had returned from the captivity, made booths, and dwelt in booths: for the children of Israel [had] not done so from the days of Jesus the son of Naue until that day: and there was great joy.
016	NEH	008	018	And [Esdras] read in the book of the law of God daily, from the first day even to the last day: and they kept the feast seven days; and on the eighth day a solemn assembly, according to the ordinance.
016	NEH	009	001	Now on the twenty-fourth day of this month the children of Israel assembled with fasting, and in sackcloths, and with ashes on their head.
016	NEH	009	002	And the children of Israel separated themselves from every stranger, and stood and confessed their sins, and the iniquities of their fathers.
016	NEH	009	003	And they stood in their place, and read in the book of the law of the Lord their god: and they confessed [their sins] to the Lord, and worshipped the Lord their God.
016	NEH	009	004	[And] there stood upon the stairs, of the Levites, Jesus, and the sons of Cadmiel, Sechenia the son of Sarabia, sons of Choneni; and they cried with a loud voice to the Lord their God.
016	NEH	009	005	And the Levites, Jesus and Cadmiel, said, Rise up, bless the Lord our God forever and ever: and let them bless thy glorious name, and exalt it with all blessing and praise.
016	NEH	009	006	And Esdras said, Thou art the only true Lord; thou madest the heaven, and the heaven of heavens, and all their array, the earth, and all things that are in it, the seas, and all things in them; and thou quickenest all things, and the hosts of heaven worship thee.
016	NEH	009	007	Thou art the Lord God, thou didst choose Abram, and broughtest him out of the land of the Chaldeans, and gavest him the name of Abraam:
016	NEH	009	008	and thou foundest his heart faithful before thee, and didst make a covenant with him to give to him and to his seed the land of the Chananites, and the Chettites, and Amorites, and Pherezites, and Jebusites, and Gergesites; and thou hast confirmed thy words, for thou [art] righteous.
016	NEH	009	009	And thou sawest the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and thou heardest their cry at the Red Sea.
016	NEH	009	010	And thou shewedst signs and wonders in Egypt, on Pharao and all his servants, and on all the people of his land: for thou knowest that they behaved insolently against them: and thou madest thyself a name, as at this day.
016	NEH	009	011	And thou didst cleave the sea before them, and they passed through the midst of the sea on dry land; and thou didst cast into the deep them that were about to pursue them, as a stone in the mighty water.
016	NEH	009	012	And thou guidedst them by day by a pillar of cloud, and by night by a pillar of fire, to enlighten for them the way wherein they should walk.
016	NEH	009	013	Also thou camest down upon mount Sina, and thou spakest to them out of heaven, and gavest them right judgments, and laws of truth, ordinances, and good commandments.
016	NEH	009	014	And thou didst make known to them thy holy sabbath; thou didst enjoin upon them commandments, and ordinances, and a law, by the hand of thy servant Moses.
016	NEH	009	015	And thou gavest them bread from heaven for their food, and thou broughtest them forth water from a rock for their thirst; and thou badest them go in to inherit the land over which thou stretchedst out thy hand to give [it] them.
016	NEH	009	016	But they and our fathers behaved proudly, and hardened their neck, and did not hearken to thy commandments,
016	NEH	009	017	and refused to listen, and remembered not thy wonders which thou wroughtest with them; and they hardened their neck, and appointed a leader to return to their slavery in Egypt: but thou, O God, [art] merciful and compassionate, long-suffering, and abundant in mercy, and thou didst not forsake them.
016	NEH	009	018	And still farther they even made to themselves a molten calf, and said, These [are] the gods that brought us up out of Egypt: and they wrought great provocations.
016	NEH	009	019	Yet thou in thy great compassions didst not forsake them in the wilderness: thou didst not turn away from them the pillar of the cloud by day, to guide them in the way, nor the pillar of fire by night, to enlighten for them the way wherein they should walk.
016	NEH	009	020	And thou gavest thy good Spirit to instruct them, and thou didst not withhold thy manna from their mouth, and gavest them water in their thirst.
016	NEH	009	021	And thou didst sustain them forty years in the wilderness; thou didst not allow anything to fail them: their garments did not wax old, and their feet were not bruised.
016	NEH	009	022	Moreover, thou gavest them kingdoms, and didst divide nations to them: and they inherited the land of Seon king of Esebon, and the land of Og king of Basan.
016	NEH	009	023	And thou didst multiply their children as the stars of heaven, and broughtest them into the land of which thou spokest to their fathers;
016	NEH	009	024	And they inherited it: and thou didst destroy from before them the dwellers in the land of the Chananites, and thou gavest into their hands them and their kings, and the nations of the land, to do unto them as it pleased them.
016	NEH	009	025	And they took lofty cities, and inherited houses full of all good things, wells dug, vineyards, and oliveyards, and every fruit tree in abundance: so they ate, and were filled, and grew fat, and rioted in thy great goodness.
016	NEH	009	026	But they turned, and revolted from thee, and cast thy law behind their backs; and they slew thy prophets, who testified against them to turn them back to thee, and they wrought great provocations.
016	NEH	009	027	Then thou gavest them into the hand of them that afflicted them, and they did afflict them: and they cried to thee in the time of their affliction, and thou didst hear them from thy heaven, and in thy great compassions gavest them deliverers, and didst save them from the hand of them that afflicted them.
016	NEH	009	028	But when they rested, they did evil again before thee: so thou leftest them in the hands of their enemies, and they ruled over them: and they cried again to thee, and thou heardest [them] from heaven, and didst deliver them in thy great compassions.
016	NEH	009	029	And thou didst testify against them, to bring them back to thy law: but they hearkened not, but sinned against thy commandments and thy judgments, which if a man do, he shall live in them; and they turned their back, and hardened their neck, and heard not.
016	NEH	009	030	Yet thou didst bear long with them many years, and didst testify to them by thy Spirit by the hand of thy prophets: but they hearkened not; so thou gavest them into the hand of the nations of the land.
016	NEH	009	031	But thou in thy many mercies didst not appoint them to destruction, and didst not forsake them; for thou art strong, and merciful, and pitiful.
016	NEH	009	032	And now, O our God, the powerful, the great, the mighty, and the terrible, keeping thy covenant and thy mercy, let not all the trouble seem little in thy sight which has come upon us, and our kings, and our princes, and our priests, and our prophets, and our fathers, and upon all thy people, from the days of the kings of Assur even to this day.
016	NEH	009	033	But thou [art] righteous in all the things that come upon us; for thou hast wrought faithfully, but we have greatly sinned.
016	NEH	009	034	And our kings, and our princes, and our priests, and our fathers, have not performed thy law, and have not given heed to thy commandments, and [have not kept] thy testimonies which thou didst testify to them.
016	NEH	009	035	And they did not serve thee in thy kingdom, and in thy great goodness which thou gavest to them, and in the large and fat land which thou didst furnish before them, and they turned not from their evil devices.
016	NEH	009	036	Behold, we are servants this day, and [as for] the land which thou gavest to our fathers to eat the fruit of it and the good things of it, behold, we are servants upon it:
016	NEH	009	037	and its produce [is] abundant for the kings whom thou didst appoint over us because of our sins; and they have dominion over our bodies, and over our cattle, as it pleases them, and we are in great affliction.
016	NEH	009	038	And in regard to all these circumstances we make a covenant, and write [it], and our princes, our Levites, [and] our priests, set their seal to [it].
016	NEH	010	001	And over them that sealed were Neemias the Artasastha, son of Achalia, and Zedekias,

016	NEH	010	028	And the rest of the people, the priests, the Levites, the porters, the singers, the Nathinim, and every one who drew off from the nations of the land to the law of God, their wives, their sons, their daughters, every one who had knowledge and understanding,
016	NEH	010	029	were urgent with their brethren, and bound them under a curse, and entered into a curse, and into an oath, to walk in the law of God, which was given by the hand of Moses, the servant of God; to keep and to do all the commandments of the Lord, and his judgments, and his ordinances;
016	NEH	010	030	and that we will not, [they said,]give our daughters to the people of the land, nor will we take their daughters to our sons.
016	NEH	010	031	And [as for] the people of the land who bring wares and all [manner of] merchandise to sell on the sabbath-day, we [will] not buy of them on the sabbath or on the holy day: and we will leave the seventh year, and the exaction of every debt.
016	NEH	010	032	And we will impose ordinances upon ourselves, to levy on ourselves the third part of a didrachm yearly for the service of the house of our God;
016	NEH	010	033	the shewbread, and the continual meat-offering, and for the continual whole-burnt-offering, of the sabbaths, of the new moon, for the feast, and for the holy things, and the sin-offerings, to make atonement for Israel, and for the works of the house of our God.
016	NEH	010	034	And we cast lots for the office of wood-bearing, [we] the priests, and the Levites, and the people, to bring [wood] into the house of our God, according to the house of our families, at certain set times, year by year, to burn on the altar of the Lord our God, as it is written in the law:

016	NEH	010	037	And the first-fruits of our corn, and the fruit of every tree, of wine, and of oil, will we bring to the priests to the treasury of the house of God; and a tithe of our land to the Levites: for the Levites themselves shall receive tithes in all the cities of the land we cultivate.
016	NEH	010	038	And the priest the son of Aaron shall be with the Levites in the tithe of the Levite: and the Levites shall bring up the tenth part of [their] tithe to the house of our God, into the treasuries of the house of God.
016	NEH	010	039	For the children of Israel and the children of Levi shall bring into the treasuries the first-fruits of the corn, and wine, and oil; and there [are] the holy vessels, and the priests, and the ministers, and the porters, and the singers: and we will not forsake the house of our God.
016	NEH	011	001	And the chiefs of the people dwelt in Jerusalem: and the rest of the people cast lots, to bring one of [every] ten to dwell in Jerusalem the holy city, and nine parts in the [other] cities.
016	NEH	011	002	And the people blessed all the men that volunteered to dwell in Jerusalem.
016	NEH	011	003	Now these [are] the chiefs of the province who dwelt in Jerusalem, and in the cities of Juda; [every] man dwelt in his possession in their cities: Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the Nathinim, and the children of the servants of Solomon.

016	NEH	011	015	And of the Levites; Samaia, son of Esricam,
016	NEH	011	017	Matthanias son of Micha, and Jobeb son of Samui,
016	NEH	011	018	two hundred and eighty-four.
016	NEH	011	019	And the porters; Acub, Telamin, and their brethren, a hundred and seventy-two.
016	NEH	011	022	And the overseer of the Levites [was] the son of Bani, son of Ozi, son of Asabia, the son of Micha. Of the sons of Asaph the singers [some were] over the house of God,
016	NEH	011	023	For so was the king's commandment concerning them.
016	NEH	011	024	And Phathaia son of Baseza was in attendance on the king in every matter for the people,
016	NEH	011	025	and with regard to villages in their country district: and [some] of the children of Juda dwelt in Cariatharboc,
016	NEH	011	026	and in Jesu,
016	NEH	011	027	and in Bersabee:
016	NEH	011	030	And their villages [were] Lachis and her hands: and they pitched their tents in Bersabee.
016	NEH	011	031	And the children of Benjamin [dwelt] from Gabaa [to] Machmas.
016	NEH	011	036	And of the Levites there were divisions to Juda [and] to Benjamin.
016	NEH	012	001	Now these [are] the priests and the Levites that went up with Zorobabel the son of Salathiel and Jesus: Saraia, Jeremia, Esdra,
016	NEH	012	002	Amaria, Maluch,
016	NEH	012	003	Sechenia.
016	NEH	012	007	These [were] the chiefs of the priests, and their brethren in the days of Jesus.
016	NEH	012	008	And the Levites [were], Jesus, Banui, Cadmiel, Sarabia, Jodae, Matthania: he [was] over the bands,
016	NEH	012	009	and his brethren [were appointed] to the daily courses.
016	NEH	012	010	And Jesus begot Joakim, and Joakim begot Eliasib, and Eliasib [begot] Jodae,
016	NEH	012	011	and Jodae begot Jonathan, and Jonathan begot Jadu.
016	NEH	012	012	And in the days of Joakim, his brethren the priests and the heads of families [were, belonging] to Saraia, Amaria; to Jeremia, Anania;
016	NEH	012	013	to Esdra, Mesulam; to Amaria, Joanan;
016	NEH	012	014	to Amaluch, Jonathan; to Sechenia, Joseph;
016	NEH	012	015	to Are, Mannas; to Marioth, Elcai;
016	NEH	012	016	to Adadai, Zacharia; to Ganathoth, Mesolam;
016	NEH	012	017	to Abia, Zechri; to Miamin, Maadai; to Pheleti, [one];
016	NEH	012	018	to Balgas, Samue; to Semia, Jonathan;

016	NEH	012	021	to Elkia, Asabias; to Jedeiu, Nathanael.
016	NEH	012	022	The Levites in the days of Eliasib, Joada, and Joa, and Joanan, and Idua, [were] recorded heads of families: also the priests, in the reign of Darius the Persian.
016	NEH	012	023	And the sons of Levi, heads of families, [were] written in the book of the chronicles, even to the days of Joanan son of Elisue.
016	NEH	012	024	And the heads of the Levites [were] Asabia, and Sarabia, and Jesu: and the sons of Cadmiel, and their brethren over against them, were to sing hymns of praise, according to the commandment of David the man of God, course by course.
016	NEH	012	025	When I gathered the porters,
016	NEH	012	026	[it was] in the days of Joakim son of Jesus, son of Josedec, and in the days of Neemia: and Esdras the priest [was] scribe.
016	NEH	012	027	And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites in their places, to bring them to Jerusalem, to keep a feast of dedication and gladness with thanksgiving, and they sounded cymbals with songs, and [had] psalteries and harps.
016	NEH	012	028	And the sons of the singers were assembled both from the neighbourhood round about to Jerusalem, and from the villages,
016	NEH	012	029	and from the country: for the singers built themselves villages by Jerusalem.
016	NEH	012	030	And the priests and the Levites purified themselves, and they purified the people, and the porters, and the wall.
016	NEH	012	031	And they brought up the princes of Juda on the wall, and they appointed two great [companies] for thanksgiving, and they passed on the right hand on the wall of the dung-gate.
016	NEH	012	032	And after them went Osaia, and half the princes of Juda,
016	NEH	012	033	and Azarias, and Esdras, and Mesollam,
016	NEH	012	034	and Juda, and Benjamin, and Samaias and Jeremia.
016	NEH	012	035	And [some] of the sons of the priest with trumpets, Zacharias son of Jonathan, son of Samaias, son of Matthania, son of Michaia, son of Zacchur, son of Asaph:
016	NEH	012	036	and his brethren, Samaia, and Oziel, Gelol, Jama, Aia, Nathanael, and Juda, Anani, to praise with the hymns of David the man of God; and Esdras the scribe [was] before them,
016	NEH	012	037	at the gate, to praise before them, and they went up by the steps of the city of David, in the ascent of the wall, above the house of David, even to the water-gate
016	NEH	012	039	of Ephraim, and to the fish-gate, and by the tower of Anameel, and as far as the sheep-gate.
016	NEH	012	042	And the singers were heard, and were numbered.
016	NEH	012	043	And in that day they offered great sacrifices, and rejoiced; for God had made them very joyful: and their wives and their children rejoiced: and the joy in Jerusalem was heard from afar off.
016	NEH	012	044	And in that day they appointed men over the treasuries, for the treasures, the first-fruits, and the tithes, and [for] the chiefs of the cities who were assembled among them, [to furnish] portions for the priests and Levites: for [there was] joy in Juda over the priests and over the Levites that waited.
016	NEH	012	045	And they kept the charges of their God, and the charges of the purification, and [ordered] the singers and the porters, according to the commandments of David and his son Solomon.
016	NEH	012	046	For in the days of David Asaph was originally first of the singers, and [they sang] hymns and praise to God.
016	NEH	012	047	And all Israel in the days of Zorobabel, and in the days of Neemias, gave the portions of the singers and the porters, a daily rate: and consecrated them to the Levites: and the Levites consecrated them to the sons of Aaron.
016	NEH	013	001	In that day they read in the book of Moses in the ears of the people; and it was found written in it, that the Ammonites and Moabites should not enter into the congregation of God for ever;
016	NEH	013	002	because they met not the children of Israel with bread and water, but hired Balaam against them to curse them: but our God turned the curse into a blessing.
016	NEH	013	003	And it came to pass, when they heard the law, that they were separated, [even] every alien in Israel.
016	NEH	013	004	And before this time Eliasib the priest dwelt in the treasury of the house of our God, connected with Tobias;
016	NEH	013	005	and he made himself a great treasury, and there they were formerly in the habit of bestowing the offerings, and the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithe of the corn, and the wine, and the oil, the ordered portion of the Levites, and singers, and porters; and the first-fruits of the priests.
016	NEH	013	006	But in all this [time] I was not in Jerusalem; for in the thirty-second year of Arthasastha king of Babylon I came to the king, and after a certain time I made my request of the king;
016	NEH	013	007	and I came to Jerusalem, and I understood the mischief which Eliasib had done in the case of Tobias, in making for him a treasury in the court of the house of God.
016	NEH	013	008	And it appeared very evil to me: so I cast forth all the furniture of the house of Tobias from the treasury.
016	NEH	013	009	And I gave orders, and they purified the treasuries: and I restored thither the vessels of the house of God, [and] the offerings, and the frankincense.
016	NEH	013	010	And I understood that the portion of the Levites had not been given: and they had fled every one to his field, the Levites and the singers doing the work.
016	NEH	013	011	And I strove with the commanders, and said, Wherefore has the house of God been abandoned? and I assembled them, and set them in their place.
016	NEH	013	012	And all Juda brought a tithe of the wheat and the wine and the oil into the treasuries,
016	NEH	013	013	to the charge of Selemia the priest, and Sadoc the scribe, and Phadaea of the Levites: and next to them [was] Anan the son of Zacchur, son of Matthanias; for they were accounted faithful: [it was] their office to distribute to their brethren.
016	NEH	013	014	Remember me, O God, in this, and let not my kindness be forgotten which I have wrought in [regard to] the house of the Lord God.
016	NEH	013	015	In those days I saw in Juda [men] treading wine-presses on the sabbath, and carrying sheaves, and loading asses with both wine, and grapes, and figs, and every [kind of] burden, and bringing them into Jerusalem on the sabbath-day:
016	NEH	013	016	and I testified in the day of their sale. Also their dwelt in it [men] bringing fish, and selling every [kind of] merchandise to the children of Juda and in Jerusalem on the sabbath.
016	NEH	013	017	And I strove with the free children of Juda, and said to them, What [is] this evil thing which ye do, and profane the sabbath-day?
016	NEH	013	018	Did not your fathers thus, and our God brought upon them and upon us and upon this city all these evils? and do ye bring additional wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath?
016	NEH	013	019	And it came to pass, when the gates were set up in Jerusalem, before the sabbath, that I spoke, and they shut the gates; and I gave orders that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and I set [some] of my servants at the gates, that none should bring [in] burdens on the sabbath-day.
016	NEH	013	020	So all [the merchants] lodged, and carried on traffic without Jerusalem once or twice.
016	NEH	013	021	Then I testified against them, and said to them, Why do ye lodge in front of the wall? if ye do so again, I will stretch out my hand upon you. From that time they came not on the sabbath.
016	NEH	013	022	and I told the Levites who were purifying themselves, and came and kept the gates, that they should sanctify the sabbath-day. Remember me, O God, for these things, and spare me according to the abundance of thy mercy.
016	NEH	013	023	And in those days I saw the Jews who had married women of Ashdod, of Ammon, [and] of Moab:
016	NEH	013	024	and their children spoke half in the language of Ashdod, and did not know how to speak in the Jewish language.
016	NEH	013	025	And I strove with them and cursed them; and I smote some of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, [saying,]Ye shall not give your daughters to their sons, and ye shall not take of their daughters to your sons.
016	NEH	013	026	Did not Solomon king of Israel sin thus? though there was no king like him among many nations, and he was beloved of God, and God made him king over all Israel; yet strange women turned him aside.
016	NEH	013	027	So we will not hearken to you to do all this evil, to break covenant with our God, —to marry strange wives.
016	NEH	013	028	and Elisub the high priest, [one] of the sons of Joada, [being] son-in-law of Sanaballat the Uranite, I chased him away from me.
016	NEH	013	029	Remember them, O God, for their [false] connection with the priesthood, and [the breaking] the covenant of the priesthood, and [for defiling] the Levites.
016	NEH	013	030	So I purged them from all foreign connection, and established courses for the priests and the Levites, [every] man according to his work.
016	NEH	013	031	And the offering of the wood-bearers [was] at certain set times, and in the [times of the] first-fruits. Remember me, O our God, for good.

# BOOK	017	EST	Esther	Esther
017	EST	001	001	And it came to pass after these things in the days of Artaxerxes, —(this Artaxerxes ruled over a hundred and twenty-seven provinces from India)—
017	EST	001	002	in those days, when king Artaxerxes was on the throne in the city of Susa,
017	EST	001	003	in the third year of his reign, he made a feast to his friends, and the other nations, and to the nobles of the Persians and Medes, and the chief of the satraps.
017	EST	001	004	And after this, after he had shewn to them the wealth of his kingdom, and the abundant glory of his wealth during a hundred and eighty days,
017	EST	001	005	when, [I say], the days of the marriage feast were completed, the king made a banquet to the nations who were present in the city six days, in the court of the king’s house,
017	EST	001	006	[which was] adorned with [hangings] of fine linen and flax on cords of fine linen and purple, fastened to golden and silver studs, on pillars of Parian marble and stone: [there were] golden and silver couches on a pavement of emerald stone, and of pearl, and of Parian stone, and open-worked coverings variously flowered, [having] roses worked round about;
017	EST	001	007	gold and silver cups, and a small cup of carbuncle set out of the value of thirty thousand talents, abundant and sweet wine, which the king himself drank.
017	EST	001	008	And this banquet was not according to the appointed law; but so the king would have it: and he charged the stewards to perform his will and that of the company.
017	EST	001	009	Also Astin the queen made a banquet for the women in the palace where king Artaxerxes [dwelt].
017	EST	001	010	Now on the seventh day the king, being merry, told Aman, and Bazan, and Tharrha, and Barazi, and Zatholtha, and Abataza, and Tharaba, the seven chamberlains, servants of king Artaxerxes,
017	EST	001	011	to bring in the queen to him, to enthrone her, and crown her with the diadem, and to shew her to the princes, and her beauty to the nations: for she was beautiful.
017	EST	001	012	But queen Astin hearkened not to him to come with the chamberlains: so the king was grieved and angered.
017	EST	001	013	And he said to his friends, Thus has Astin spoken: pronounce therefore upon this [case] law and judgment.
017	EST	001	014	So Arkesæus, and Sarsathæus, and Malisear, the princes of the Persians and Medes, who were near the king, who sat chief [in rank] by the king, drew near to him,
017	EST	001	015	and reported to him according to the laws how it was proper to do to queen Astin, because she had not done the things commanded of the king by the chamberlains.
017	EST	001	016	And Muchæus said to the king and to the princes, Queen Astin has not wronged the king only, but also all the king’s rulers and princes:
017	EST	001	017	for he has told them the words of the queen, and how she disobeyed the king. As then, [said he], she refused [to obey] king Artaxerxes,
017	EST	001	018	so this day shall the other ladies of the chiefs of the Persians and Medes, having heard what she said to the king, dare in the same way to dishonour their husbands.
017	EST	001	019	If then it seem good to the king, let him make a royal decree, and let it be written according to the laws of the Medes and Persians, and let him not alter [it]: and let not the queen come in to him any more; and let the king give her royalty to a woman better than she.
017	EST	001	020	And let the law of the king which he shall have made, be widely proclaimed, in his kingdom: and so shall all the women give honour to their husbands, from the poor even to the rich.
017	EST	001	021	And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did as Muchæus had said,
017	EST	001	022	and sent into all his kingdom through the several provinces, according to their language, in order that men might be feared in their own houses.
017	EST	002	001	And after this the king’s anger was pacified, and he no more mentioned Astin, bearing in mind what she had said, and how he had condemned her.
017	EST	002	002	Then the servants of the king said, Let there be sought for the king chaste [and] beautiful young virgins.
017	EST	002	003	And let the king appoint local governors in all the provinces of his kingdom, and let them select fair [and] chaste young damsels [and bring them] to the city Susa, into the women’s apartment, and let them be consigned to the king’s chamberlain, the keeper of the women; and let things for purification and other attendance be given [to them].
017	EST	002	004	And let the woman who shall please the king be queen instead of Astin. And the thing pleased the king; and he did so.
017	EST	002	005	Now there was a Jew in the city Susa, and his name was Mardochæus, the [son] of Jairus, [the son] of Semeias, [the son] of Cisæus, of the tribe of Benjamin;
017	EST	002	006	who had been brought a prisoner from Jerusalem, which Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon had carried into captivity.
017	EST	002	007	And he had a foster-child, daughter of Aminadab his father’s brother, and her name [was] Esther; and when her parents were dead, he brought her up for a wife for himself: and the damsel was beautiful.
017	EST	002	008	And because the king’s ordinance was published, many damsels were gathered to the city Susa under the hand of Gai; and Esther was brought to Gai the keeper of the women.
017	EST	002	009	And the damsel pleased him, and she found favour in his sight; and he hasted to give her the things for purification, and her portion, and the seven maidens appointed her out of the palace: and he treated her and her maidens well in the women’s apartment.
017	EST	002	010	But Esther discovered not her family nor her kindred: for Mardochæus had charged her not to tell.
017	EST	002	011	But Mardochæus used to walk every day by the women’s court, to see what would become of Esther.
017	EST	002	012	Now this was the time for a virgin to go in to the king, when she should have fulfilled twelve months; for so are the days of purification fulfilled, six months while they are anointing themselves with oil of myrrh, and six months with spices and women’s purifications.
017	EST	002	013	And then [the damsel] goes in to the king; and [the officer] to whomsoever he shall give the command, will bring her to come in with him from the women’s apartment to the king’s chamber.
017	EST	002	014	She enters in the evening, and in the morning she departs to the second women’s apartment, where Gai the king’s chamberlain [is] keeper of the women: and she goes not in to the king again, unless she should be called by name.
017	EST	002	015	And when the time was fulfilled for Esther the daughter of Aminadab the brother of Mardochæus’ father to go in to the king, she neglected nothing which the chamberlain, the women’s keeper, commanded; for Esther found grace in the sight of all that looked upon her.
017	EST	002	016	So Esther went in to king Artaxerxes in the twelfth month, which is Adar, in the seventh year of his reign.
017	EST	002	017	And the king loved Esther, and she found favour beyond all the [other] virgins: and he put on her the queen’s crown.
017	EST	002	018	And the king made a banquet for all his friends and great men for seven days, and he highly celebrated the marriage of Esther; and he made a release to those who were under his dominion.
017	EST	002	019	But Mardochæus served in the palace.
017	EST	002	020	Now Esther had not discovered her kindred; for so Mardochæus commanded her, to fear God, and perform his commandments, as when she was with him: and Esther changed not her manner of life.
017	EST	002	021	And two chamberlains of the king, the chiefs of the body-guard, were grieved, because Mardochæus was promoted; and they sought to kill king Artaxerxes.
017	EST	002	022	And the matter was discovered to Mardochæus, and he made it known to Esther, and she declared to the king the matter of the conspiracy.
017	EST	002	023	And the king examined the two chamberlains, and hanged them: and the king gave orders to make a note for a memorial in the royal records of the good offices of Mardochæus, as a commendation.
017	EST	003	001	And after this king Artaxerxes highly honoured Aman [son] of Amadathes, the Bugæan, and exalted him, and set his seat above all his friends.
017	EST	003	002	And all in the palace did him obeisance, for so the king had given orders to do: but Mardochæus did not do him obeisance.
017	EST	003	003	And they in the king’s palace said to Mardochæus, Mardochæus, why dost thou transgress the commands of the king?
017	EST	003	004	[Thus] they spoke daily to him, but he hearkened not unto them; so they represented to Aman that Mardochæus resisted the commands of the king: and Mardochæus had shewn to them that he was a Jew.
017	EST	003	005	And when Aman understood that Mardochæus did not obeisance to him, he was greatly enraged,
017	EST	003	006	and took counsel to destroy utterly all the Jews who were under the rule of Artaxerxes.
017	EST	003	007	And he made a decree in the twelfth year of the reign of Artaxerxes, and cast lots daily and monthly, to slay in one day the race of Mardochæus: and the lot fell on the fourteenth [day] of the month which is Adar.
017	EST	003	008	And he spoke to king Artaxerxes, saying, There is a nation scattered among the nations in all thy kingdom, and their laws differ from [those of] all the [other] nations; and they disobey the laws of the king; and it is not expedient for the king to let them alone.
017	EST	003	009	If it seem good to the king, let him make a decree to destroy them: and I will remit into the king’s treasury ten thousand talents of silver.
017	EST	003	010	And the king took off his ring, and gave it into the hands of Aman, to seal the decrees against the Jews.
017	EST	003	011	And the king said to Aman, Keep the silver, and treat the nation as thou wilt.
017	EST	003	012	So the king’s recorders were called in the first month, on the thirteenth [day], and they wrote as Aman commanded to the captains and governors in every province, from India even to Ethiopia, to a hundred and twenty-seven provinces; and to the rulers of the nations according to their [several] languages, in the name of king Artaxerxes.
017	EST	003	013	And [the message] was sent by posts throughout the kingdom of Artaxerxes, to destroy utterly the race of the Jews on the first day of the twelfth month, which is Adar, and to plunder their goods. [And the following is the copy of the letter; The great king Artaxerxes writes thus to the rulers and inferior governors of a hundred and twenty-seven provinces, from India even to Ethiopia, who hold authority under [him]. Ruling over many nations, and having obtained dominion over the whole world, I was minded, (not elated by the confidence of power, but ever conducting [myself] with great moderation and with gentleness,) to make the lives of [my] subjects continually tranquil, desiring both to maintain the kingdom quiet and orderly to [its] utmost limits, and to restore the peace desired by all men. But when I had enquired of my counsellors how this should be brought to pass, Aman, who excels in soundness of judgment among us, and has been manifestly well inclined without wavering and with unshaken fidelity, and has obtained the second post in the kingdom, informed us that a certain ill-disposed people is mixed up with all the tribes throughout the world, opposed in their laws to every [other] nation, and continually neglecting the commands of the kings, so that the united government blamelessly administered by us is not quietly established. Having then conceived that this nation alone [of all others] is continually set in opposition to every man, introducing as a change a foreign code of laws, and injuriously plotting to accomplish the worst of evils against our interests, and against the happy establishment of the monarchy; we have accordingly appointed those who are signified to you in the letters written by Aman, who is set over [the public] affairs and is our second governor, to destroy them all utterly with their wives and children by the swords of the enemies, without pitying or sparing any, on the fourteenth day of the twelfth month Adar, of the present year; that the people aforetime and now ill-disposed [to us] having been violently consigned to death in one day, may hereafter secure to us continually a well constituted and quiet [state of] affairs.]
017	EST	003	014	And the copies of the letters were published in every province; and an order was given to all the nations to be ready against that day.
017	EST	003	015	And the business was hastened, and [that] at Susa: and the king and Aman began to drink; but the city was troubled.
017	EST	004	001	But Mardochæus having perceived what was done, rent his garments, and put on sackcloth, and sprinkled dust upon himself; and having rushed forth through the open street of the city, he cried with a loud voice, A nation that has done no wrong is going to be destroyed.
017	EST	004	002	And he came to the king’s gate, and stood; for it was not lawful for him to enter into the palace, wearing sackcloth and ashes.
017	EST	004	003	And in every province where the letters were published, [there was] crying and lamentation and great mourning on the part of the Jews: they spread for themselves sackcloth and ashes.
017	EST	004	004	And the queen’s maids and chamberlains went in and told her: and when she had heard what was done, she was disturbed; and she sent to clothe Mardochæus, and take away his sackcloth; but he consented not.
017	EST	004	005	So Esther called for her chamberlain Achrathæus, who waited upon her; and she sent to learn the truth from Mardochæus.
017	EST	004	007	And Mardochæus shewed him what was done, and the promise which Aman had made the king of ten thousand talents [to be paid] into the treasury, that he might destroy the Jews.
017	EST	004	008	And he gave him the copy [of the writing] that was published in Susa concerning their destruction, to shew to Esther; and told him to charge her to go in and intreat the king, and to beg him for the people, remembering, [said he], the days of thy low estate, how thou wert nursed by my hand: because Aman who holds the next place to the king has spoken against us for death. Do thou call upon the Lord, and speak to the king concerning us, to deliver us from death.
017	EST	004	009	So Achrathæus went in and told her all these words.
017	EST	004	010	And Esther said to Achrathæus, Go to Mardochæus, and say,
017	EST	004	011	All the nations of the empire know, that whoever, man or woman, shall go in to the king into the inner court uncalled, that person cannot live: only to whomsoever the king shall stretch out [his] golden sceptre, he shall live: and I have not been called to go in to the king, for these thirty days.
017	EST	004	012	And Achrathæus reported to Mardochæus all the words of Esther.
017	EST	004	013	Then Mardochæus said to Achrathæus, Go, and say to her, Esther, say not to thyself that thou alone wilt escape in the kingdom, more than all the [other] Jews.
017	EST	004	014	For if thou shalt refuse to hearken on this occasion, help and protection will be to the Jews from another quarter; but thou and thy father’s house will perish: and who knows, if thou hast been made queen for this [very] occasion?
017	EST	004	015	And Esther sent the [man] that came to her to Mardochæus, saying,
017	EST	004	016	Go and assemble the Jews that are in Susa, and fast ye for me, and eat not and drink not for three days, night and day: and I also and my maidens will fast; and then I will go in to the king contrary to the law, even if I must die.
017	EST	004	017	So Mardochæus went and did all that Esther commanded him. [And he besought the Lord, making mention of all the works of the Lord; and he said, Lord God, king ruling over all, for all things are in thy power, and there is no one that shall oppose thee in thy purpose to save Israel.—For thou hast made the heaven and the earth, and every wonderful thing in the [world] under heaven. And thou art Lord of all, and there is no one who shall resist thee the Lord. Thou knowest all things: thou knowest, Lord, that it is not in insolence, nor haughtiness, nor love of glory, that I have done this, to refuse obeisance to the haughty Aman. For I would gladly have kissed the soles of his feet for the safety of Israel. But I have done this, that I might not set the glory of man above the glory of God: and I will not worship any one except thee, my Lord, and I will not do these things in haughtiness. And now, O Lord God, the King, the God of Abraam, spare thy people, for [our enemies] are looking upon us to [our] destruction, and they have desired to destroy thine ancient inheritance. Do not overlook thy peculiar people, whom thou hast redeemed for thyself out of the land of Egypt. Hearken to my prayer, and be propitious to thine inheritance, and turn our mourning into gladness, that we may live and sing praise to thy name, O Lord; and do not utterly destroy the mouth of them that praise thee, O Lord. And all Israel cried with [all] their might, for their death [was] before their eyes. And queen Esther betook herself for refuge to the Lord, being taken [as it were] in the agony of death. And having taken off her glorious apparel, she put on garments of distress and mourning; and instead of grand perfumes she filled her head with ashes and dung, and she greatly brought down her body, and she filled every place of her glad adorning with the [torn] curls of her hair. And she besought the Lord God of Israel, and said, O my Lord, thou alone art our king: help me [who am] destitute, and have no helper but thee, for my danger [is] near at hand. I have heard from my birth, in the tribe of my kindred, that thou, Lord, tookest Israel out of all the nations, and our fathers out of all their kindred for a perpetual inheritance, and hast wrought for them all that thou hast said. And now we have sinned before thee, and thou hast delivered us into the hands of our enemies, because we honoured their gods: thou art righteous, O Lord. But now they have not been contented with the bitterness of our slavery, but have laid their hands on the hands of their idols, [in order] to abolish the decree of thy mouth, and utterly to destroy thine inheritance, and to stop the mouth of them that praise thee, and to extinguish the glory of thine house and thine altar, and to open the mouth of the Gentiles to [speak] the praises of vanities, and [in order] that a mortal king should be admired for ever. O Lord, do not resign thy sceptre to them that are not, and let them not laugh at our fall, but turn their counsel against themselves, and make an example of him who has begun [to injure] us. Remember [us], O Lord, manifest thyself in the time of our affliction, and encourage me, O king of gods, and ruler of all dominion. Put harmonious speech into my mouth before the lion, and turn his heart to hate him that fights against us, to the utter destruction of him and of them that consent with him. But deliver us by thine hand, and help me [who am] destitute, and have none but thee, O Lord. Thou knowest all things, and knowest that I hate the glory of transgressors, and that I abhor the couch of the uncircumcised, and of every stranger. Thou knowest my necessity, for I abhor the symbol of my proud station, which is upon my head in the days of my splendour: I abhor it as a menstruous cloth, and I wear it not in the days of my tranquillity. And thy handmaid has not eaten [at] the table of Aman, and I have not honoured the banquet of the king, neither have I drunk wine of libations. Neither has thy handmaid rejoiced since the day of my promotion until now, except in thee, O Lord God of Abraam. O God, who hast power over all, hearken to the voice of the desperate, and deliver us from the hand of them that devise mischief; and deliver me from my fear.
017	EST	005	001	And it came to pass on the third day, when she had ceased praying, that she put off her mean dress, and put on her glorious apparel. And being splendidly arrayed, [and] having called upon God the Overseer and Preserver of all things, she took her two maids, and she leaned upon one, as a delicate female, and the other followed bearing her train. And she [was] blooming in the perfection of her beauty; and her face [was] cheerful, as [it were] benevolent, but her heart [was] straitened for fear. And having passed through all the doors, she stood before the king: and he was sitting upon his royal throne, and he had put on all his glorious apparel, [covered] all over with gold and precious stones, and was very terrible. And having raised his face resplendent with glory, he looked with intense anger: and the queen fell, and changed her colour as she fainted; and she bowed herself upon the head of the maid that went before [her]. But God changed the spirit of the king to gentleness, and in intense feeling he sprang from off his throne, and took her into his arms, until she recovered: and he comforted her with peaceable words, and said to her, What is [the matter], Esther? I [am] thy brother; be of good cheer, thou shalt not die, for our command is openly declared [to thee], Draw nigh.
017	EST	005	002	And having raised the golden sceptre he laid it upon her neck, and embraced her, and said, Speak to me. And she said to him, I saw thee, [my] lord, as an angel of God, and my heart was troubled for fear of thy glory; for thou, [my] lord, art to be wondered at, and thy face [is] full of grace. And while she was speaking, she fainted and fell. Then the king was troubled, and all his servants comforted her.]
017	EST	005	003	And the king said, What wilt thou, Esther? and what is thy request? [ask] even to the half of my kingdom, and it shall be thine.
017	EST	005	004	And Esther said, To-day is my great day: if then it seem good to the king, let both him and Aman come to the feast which I will prepare this day.
017	EST	005	005	And the king said, Hasten Aman hither, that we may perform the word of Esther. So they both come to the feast of which Esther had spoken.
017	EST	005	006	And at the banquet the king said to Esther, What is [thy request], queen Esther? [speak], and thou shalt have all that thou requirest.
017	EST	005	007	And she said, My request and my petition [are]:
017	EST	005	008	if I have found favour in the sight of the king, let the king and Aman come again to-morrow to the feast which I shall prepare for them, and to-morrow I will do the same.
017	EST	005	009	So Aman went out from the king very glad [and] merry: but when Aman saw Mardochæus the Jew in the court, he was greatly enraged.
017	EST	005	010	And having gone into his own house, he called his friends, and his wife Zosara.
017	EST	005	011	And he shewed them his wealth, and the glory with which the king had invested him, and how he had caused him to take precedence and bear chief rule in the kingdom.
017	EST	005	012	And Aman said, The queen has called no one to the feast with the king but me, and I am invited to-morrow.
017	EST	005	013	But these things please me not, while I see Mardochæus the Jew in the court.
017	EST	005	014	And Zosara his wife and his friends said to him, Let there be a gallows made for thee of fifty cubits, and in the morning do thou speak to the king, and let Mardochæus be hanged on the gallows: but do thou go in to the feast with the king, and be merry. And the saying pleased Aman, and the gallows was prepared.
017	EST	006	001	But the Lord removed sleep from the king that night: and he told his servant to bring in the books, the registers of daily events, to read to him.
017	EST	006	002	And he found the records written concerning Mardochæus, how he had told the king concerning the two chamberlains of the king, when they were keeping guard, and sought to lay hands on Artaxerxes.
017	EST	006	003	And the king said, What honour or favour have we done to Mardochæus? And the king’s servants said, Thou hast not done anything to him.
017	EST	006	004	And while the king was enquiring about the kindness of Mardochæus, behold, Aman [was] in the court. And the king said, Who [is] in the court? Now Aman was come in to speak to the king, that he should hang Mardochæus on the gallows, which he had prepared.
017	EST	006	005	And the king’s servants said, Behold, Aman stands in the court. And the king said, Call him.
017	EST	006	006	And the king said to Aman, What shall I do to the man whom I wish to honour? And Aman said within himself, Whom would the king honour but myself?
017	EST	006	007	and he said to the king, As for the man whom the king wishes to honour,
017	EST	006	008	let the king’s servants bring the robe of fine linen which the king puts on, and the horse on which the king rides,
017	EST	006	009	and let him give [it] to one of the king’s noble friends, and let him array the man whom the king loves; and let him mount him on the horse, and proclaim through the street of the city, saying, Thus shall it be [done] to every man whom the king honours.
017	EST	006	010	Then the king said to Aman, Thou hast well said: so do to Mardochæus the Jew, who waits in the palace, and let not a word of what thou hast spoken be neglected.
017	EST	006	011	So Aman took the robe and the horse, and arrayed Mardochæus, and mounted him on the horse, and went through the street of the city, and proclaimed, saying, Thus shall it be to every man whom the king wishes to honour.
017	EST	006	012	And Mardochæus returned to the palace: but Aman went home mourning, and having his head covered.
017	EST	006	013	And Aman related the events that had befallen him to Zosara his wife, and to [his] friends: and his friends and his wife said to him, If Mardochæus [be] of the race of the Jews, [and] thou hast begun to be humbled before him, thou wilt assuredly fall, and thou wilt not be able to withstand him, for the living God [is] with him.
017	EST	006	014	While they were yet speaking, the chamberlains arrived, to hasten Aman to the banquet which Esther had prepared.
017	EST	007	001	So the king and Aman went in to drink with the queen.
017	EST	007	002	And the king said to Esther at the banquet on the second day, What is it, queen Esther? and what [is] thy request, and what [is] thy petition? and it shall be [done] for thee, to the half of my kingdom.
017	EST	007	003	And she answered and said, If I have found favour in the sight of the king, let [my] life be granted to my petition, and my people to my request.
017	EST	007	004	For both I and my people are sold for destruction, and pillage, and slavery; [both] we and our children for bondmen and bondwomen: and I consented not to it, for the slanderer [is] not worthy of the king’s palace.
017	EST	007	005	And the king said, Who [is] this that has dared to do this thing?
017	EST	007	006	And Esther said, The adversary [is] Aman, this wicked man. Then Aman was troubled before the king and the queen.
017	EST	007	007	And the king rose up from the banquet to go into the garden: and Aman began to intreat the queen; for he saw that he was in an evil case.
017	EST	007	008	And the king returned from the garden; and Aman had fallen upon the bed, intreating the queen. And the king said, Wilt thou even force [my] wife in my house? And when Aman heard it, he changed countenance.
017	EST	007	009	And Bugathan, one of the chamberlains, said to the king, Behold, Aman has also prepared a gallows for Mardochæus, who spoke concerning the king, and a gallows of fifty cubits high has been set up in the premises of Aman. And the king said, Let him be hanged thereon.
017	EST	007	010	So Aman was hanged on the gallows that had been prepared for Mardochæus: and then the king’s wrath was appeased.
017	EST	008	001	And in that day king Artaxerxes gave to Esther all that belonged to Aman the slanderer: and Mardochæus was called by the king; for Esther had shewn that he was related to her.
017	EST	008	002	And the king took the ring which he had taken away from Aman, and gave it to Mardochæus: and Esther appointed Mardochæus over all that had been Aman’s.
017	EST	008	003	And she spoke yet again to the king, and fell at his feet, and besought [him] to do away the mischief of Aman, and all that he had done against the Jews.
017	EST	008	004	Then the king stretched out to Esther the golden sceptre: and Esther arose to stand near the king.
017	EST	008	005	And Esther said, If it seem good to thee, and I have found favour [in thy sight], let an order be sent that the letters sent by Aman may be reversed, that were written for the destruction of the Jews, who are in thy kingdom.
017	EST	008	006	For how shall I be able to look upon the affliction of my people, and how shall I be able to survive the destruction of my kindred?
017	EST	008	007	And the king said to Esther, If I have given and freely granted thee all that was Aman’s, and hanged him on a gallows, because he laid his hands upon the Jews, what dost thou yet further seek?
017	EST	008	008	Write ye also in my name, as it seems good to you, and seal [it] with my ring: for whatever [orders] are written at the command of the king, and sealed with my ring, it is not lawful to gainsay them.
017	EST	008	009	So the scribes were called in the first month, which is Nisan, on the three and twentieth day of the same year; and [orders] were written to the Jews, whatever [the king had] commanded to the local governors and chiefs of the satraps, from India even to Ethiopia, a hundred and twenty-seven satraps, according to the several provinces, according to their dialects.
017	EST	008	010	And they were written by order of the king, and sealed with his ring, and they sent the letters by the posts:
017	EST	008	011	wherein he charged them to use their [own] laws in every city, and to help each other, and to treat their adversaries, and those who attacked them, as they pleased,
017	EST	008	012	on one day in all the kingdom of Artaxerxes, on the thirteenth [day] of the twelfth month, which is Adar.
017	EST	008	013	And the following is the copy of the letter of the orders. [The great king Artaxerxes sends greeting to the rulers of provinces [in] a hundred and twenty-seven satrapies, from India to Ethiopia, even to those who are faithful to our interests. Many who have been frequently honoured by the most abundant kindness of their benefactors have conceived ambitious designs, and not only endeavour to hurt our subjects, but moreover, not being able to bear prosperity, they also endeavour to plot against their own benefactors. And they not only would utterly abolish gratitude from among men, but also, elated by the boastings of men who are strangers to all that is good, they suppose that they shall escape the sin-hating vengeance of the ever-seeing God. And oftentimes [evil] exhortation has made partakers of the guilt of shedding innocent blood, and has involved in irremediable calamities, many of those who were appointed to offices of authority, who had been entrusted with the management of their friends’ affairs; while [men], by the false sophistry of an evil disposition, have deceived the simple candour of the ruling powers. And it is possible to see [this], not so much from more ancient traditionary accounts, as it is immediately in your power [to see it] by examining what things have been wickedly perpetrated by the baseness of men unworthily holding power. And [it is right] to take heed with regard to the future, that we may maintain the government in undisturbed peace for all men, adopting [needful] changes, and ever judging those cases which come under [our] notice, with truly equitable decision. For whereas Aman, a Macedonian, the son of Amadathes, in reality an alien from the blood of the Persians, and differing widely from our mild course of government, having been hospitably entertained by us, obtained so large a share of our universal kindness, as to be called our father, and to continue the person next to the royal throne, reverenced of all; [he, however], overcome by the pride [of his station], endeavoured to deprive us of our dominion, and our life; having by various and subtle artifices demanded for destruction both Mardochæus our deliverer and perpetual benefactor, and Esther the blameless consort of [our] kingdom, with their whole nation. For by these methods he thought, having surprised us in a defenceless state, to transfer the dominion of the Persians to the Macedonians. But we find that the Jews, who have been consigned to destruction by the most abominable of men, are not malefactors, but living according to the justest laws, and being the sons of the living God, the most high and mighty, who maintains the kingdom, to us as well as to our forefathers, in the most excellent order. Ye will therefore do well in refusing to obey the letters sent by Aman the son of Amadathes, because he that has done these things, has been hanged with his whole family at the gates of Susa, Almighty God having swiftly returned to him a worthy recompence. [We enjoin you] then, having openly published a copy of this letter in every place, to give the Jews permission to use their own lawful customs, and to strengthen them, that on the thirteenth of the twelfth month Adar, on the self-same day, they may defend themselves against those who attacked them in a time of affliction. For in the place of the destruction of the chosen race, Almighty God has granted them this [time of] gladness. Do ye therefore also, among your [notable] feasts, keep a distinct day with all festivity, that both now and hereafter it may be a day of deliverance to us and those who are well disposed toward the Persians, but to those that plotted against us a memorial of destruction. And every city and province collectively, which shall not do accordingly, shall be consumed with vengeance by spear and fire: it shall be made not only inaccessible to men, but also most hateful to wild beasts and birds for ever.] And let the copies be posted in conspicuous places throughout the kingdom, and let all the Jews be ready against this day, to fight against their enemies.
017	EST	008	014	So the horsemen went forth with haste to perform the king’s commands; and the ordinance was also published in Susa.
017	EST	008	015	And Mardochæus went forth robed in the royal apparel, and wearing a golden crown, and a diadem of fine purple linen: and the people in Susa saw [it] and rejoiced.
017	EST	008	016	And the Jews had light and gladness,
017	EST	008	017	in every city and province wherever the ordinance was published: wherever the proclamation took place, the Jews had joy and gladness, feasting and mirth: and many of the Gentiles were circumcised, and became Jews, for fear of the Jews.
017	EST	009	001	For in the twelfth month, on the thirteenth day of the month which is Adar, the letters written by the king arrived.
017	EST	009	002	In that day the adversaries of the Jews perished: for no one resisted, through fear of them.
017	EST	009	003	For the chiefs of the satraps, and the princes and the royal scribes, honoured the Jews; for the fear of Mardochæus lay upon them.
017	EST	009	004	For the order of the king was in force, that he should be celebrated in all the kingdom.
017	EST	009	006	And in the city Susa the Jews slew five hundred men:
017	EST	009	007	both Pharsannes, and Delphon and Phasga,
017	EST	009	008	and Pharadatha, and Barea, and Sarbaca,
017	EST	009	009	and Marmasima, and Ruphæus, and Arsæus, and Zabuthæus,
017	EST	009	010	the ten sons of Aman the son of Amadathes the Bugæan, the enemy of the Jews, and they plundered [their property] on the same day:
017	EST	009	011	and the number of them that perished in Susa was rendered to the king.
017	EST	009	012	And the king said to Esther, The Jews have slain five hundred men in the city Susa; and how, thinkest thou, have they used them in the rest of the country? What then dost thou yet ask, that it may be [done] for thee?
017	EST	009	013	And Esther said to the king, Let it be granted to the Jews so to treat them to-morrow as to hang the ten sons of Aman.
017	EST	009	014	And he permitted it to be so done; and he gave up to the Jews of the city the bodies of the sons of Aman to hang.
017	EST	009	015	And the Jews assembled in Susa on the fourteenth [day] of Adar, and slew three hundred men, but plundered no property.
017	EST	009	016	And the rest of the Jews who were in the kingdom assembled, and helped one another, and obtained rest from their enemies: for they destroyed fifteen thousand of them on the thirteenth [day] of Adar, but took no spoil.
017	EST	009	017	And they rested on the fourteenth of the same month, and kept it as a day of rest with joy and gladness.
017	EST	009	018	And the Jews in the city Susa assembled also on the fourteenth [day] and rested; and they kept also the fifteenth with joy and gladness.
017	EST	009	019	On this account then [it is that] the Jews dispersed in every foreign land keep the fourteenth of Adar [as] a holy day with joy, sending portions each to his neighbour.
017	EST	009	020	And Mardochæus wrote these things in a book, and sent them to the Jews, as many as were in the kingdom of Artaxerxes, both them that were near and them that were afar off,
017	EST	009	021	to establish these [as] joyful days, and to keep the fourteenth and fifteenth of Adar;
017	EST	009	022	for on these days the Jews obtained rest from their enemies: and [as to] the month, which was Adar, in which a change was made for them, from mourning to joy, and from sorrow to a good day, to spend the whole of it [in] good days of feasting and gladness, sending portions to their friends, and to the poor.
017	EST	009	023	And the Jews consented [to this] accordingly as Mardochæus wrote to them,
017	EST	009	024	[shewing] how Aman the son of Amadathes the Macedonian fought against them, how he made a decree and cast lots to destroy them utterly;
017	EST	009	025	also how he went in to the king, telling [him] to hang Mardochæus: but all the calamities he tried to bring upon the Jews came upon himself, and he was hanged, and his children.
017	EST	009	026	Therefore these days were called Phruræ, because of the lots; (for in their language they are called Phruræ;) because of the words of this letter, and [because of] all they suffered on this account, and all that happened to them.
017	EST	009	027	And [Mardochæus] established it, and the Jews took upon themselves, and upon their seed, and upon those that were joined to them [to observe it], neither would they on any account behave differently: but these days [were to be] a memorial kept in every generation, and city, and family, and province.
017	EST	009	028	And these days of the Phruræ, [said they], shall be kept for ever, and their memorial shall not fail in any generation.
017	EST	009	029	And queen Esther, the daughter of Aminadab, and Mardochæus the Jew, wrote all that they had done, and the confirmation of the letter of Phruræ.
017	EST	009	031	And Mardochæus and Esther the queen appointed [a fast] for themselves privately, even at that time also having formed their plan against their own health.
017	EST	009	032	And Esther established it by a command for ever, and it was written for a memorial.
017	EST	010	001	And the king levied [a tax] upon [his] kingdom both by land and sea.
017	EST	010	002	And [as for] his strength and valour, and the wealth and glory of his kingdom, behold, they are written in the book of the Persians and Medes, for a memorial.
017	EST	010	003	And Mardochæus was viceroy to king Artaxerxes, and was a great man in the kingdom, and honoured by the Jews, and passed his life beloved of all his nation. [And Mardochæus said, These things have been done of God. For I remember the dream which I had concerning these matters: for not one particular of them has failed. [There was] the little fountain, which became a river, and there was light, and the sun, and much water. The river is Esther, whom the king married, and made queen. And the two serpents are I and Aman. And the nations are those [nations] that combined to destroy the name of the Jews. But [as for] my nation, this is Israel, [even] they that cried to God, and were delivered: for the Lord delivered his people, and the Lord rescued us out of all these calamities; and God wrought such signs and great wonders as have not been done among the nations. Therefore did he ordain two lots, one for the people of God, and one for all the [other] nations. And these two lots came for an appointed season, and for a day of judgment, before God, and for all the nations. And God remembered his people, and vindicated his inheritance. And they shall observe these days, in the month Adar, on the fourteenth and on the fifteenth [day] of the month, with an assembly, and joy and gladness before God, throughout the generations for ever among his people Israel. In the fourth year of the reign of Ptolemy and Cleopatra, Dositheus, who said that he was a priest and a Levite, and Ptolemy his son, brought in the published letter of Phruræ, which they said existed, and [which] Lysimachus the son of Ptolemy, who was in Jerusalem, had interpreted.]

# BOOK	018	JOB	Job	Job
018	JOB	001	001	There was a certain man in the land of Ausis, whose name [was] Job; and than man was true, blameless, righteous, [and] godly, abstaining from everything evil.
018	JOB	001	002	And he had seven sons and three daughters.
018	JOB	001	003	And his cattle consisted of seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred she-asses in the pastures, and a very great household, and he had a great husbandry on the earth; and that man was [most] noble of the [men] of the east.
018	JOB	001	004	And his sons visiting one another prepared a banquet every day, taking with them also their three sisters to eat and drink with them.
018	JOB	001	005	And when the days of the banquet were completed, Job sent and purified them, having risen up in the morning, and offered sacrifices for them, according to their number, and one calf for a sin-offering for their souls: for Job said, Lest peradventure my sons have thought evil in their minds against God. Thus, then Job did continually.
018	JOB	001	006	And it came to pass on a day, that behold, the angels of God came to stand before the Lord, and the devil came with them.
018	JOB	001	007	And the Lord said to the devil, Whence art thou come? And the devil answered the Lord, and said, I am come from compassing the earth, and walking up and down in the world.
018	JOB	001	008	And the Lord said to him, Hast thou diligently considered my servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a man blameless, true, godly, abstaining from everything evil?
018	JOB	001	009	Then the devil answered, and said before the Lord, Does Job worship the Lord for nothing?
018	JOB	001	010	Hast thou not made a hedge about him, and about his household, and all his possessions round about? and hast thou not blessed the works of his hands, and multiplied his cattle upon the land?
018	JOB	001	011	But put forth thine hand, and touch all that he has: verily he will bless thee to [thy] face.
018	JOB	001	012	Then the Lord said to the devil, Behold, I give into thine hand all that he has, but touch not himself. So the devil went out from the presence of the Lord.
018	JOB	001	013	And it came to pass on a certain day, that Job's sons and his daughters were drinking wine in the house of their elder brother.
018	JOB	001	014	And, behold, there came a messenger to Job, and said to him, The yokes of oxen were ploughing, and the she-asses were feeding near them;
018	JOB	001	015	and the spoilers came and took them for a prey, and slew the servants with the sword; and I having escaped alone am come to tell thee.
018	JOB	001	016	While he was yet speaking, there came another messenger, and said to Job, Fire has fallen from heaven, and burnt up the sheep, and devoured the shepherds like wise; and I having escaped alone am come to tell thee.
018	JOB	001	017	While he was yet speaking, there came another messenger, and said to Job, The horsemen formed three companies against us, and surrounded the camels, and took them for a prey, and slew the servants with the sword; and I only escaped, and am come to tell thee.
018	JOB	001	018	While he is yet speaking, another messenger comes, saying to Job, While thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking with their elder brother,
018	JOB	001	019	suddenly a great wind came on from the desert, and caught the four corners of the house, and the house fell upon thy children, and they are dead; and I have escaped alone, and am come to tell thee.
018	JOB	001	020	So Job arose, and rent his garments, and shaved the hair of his head, and fell on the earth, and worshipped,
018	JOB	001	021	and said, I myself came forth naked from my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither; the Lord gave, the Lord has taken away: as it seemed good to the Lord, so has it come to pass; blessed be the name of the Lord.
018	JOB	001	022	In all these events that befell him Job sinned not at all before the Lord, and did not impute folly to God.
018	JOB	002	001	And it came to pass on a certain day, that the angels of God came to stand before the Lord, and the devil came among them to stand before the Lord.
018	JOB	002	002	And the Lord, said to the devil, Whence comest thou? Then the devil said before the Lord, I am come from going through the world, and walking about the whole earth.
018	JOB	002	003	And the Lord said to the devil, Hast thou then observed my servant Job, that there is none of [men] upon the earth like him, a harmless, true, blameless, godly man, abstaining from all evil? and he yet cleaves to innocence, whereas thou has told [me] to destroy his substance without cause?
018	JOB	002	004	And the devil answered and said to the Lord, Skin for skin, all that a man has will he give as a ransom for his life.
018	JOB	002	005	Nay, but put forth thine hand, and touch his bones and his flesh: verily he will bless thee to [thy] face.
018	JOB	002	006	And the Lord said to the devil, Behold, I deliver him up to thee; only save his life.
018	JOB	002	007	So the devil went out from the Lord, and smote Job with sore boils from [his] feet to [his] head.
018	JOB	002	008	And he took a potsherd to scrape away the discharge, and sat upon a dung-heap outside the city.
018	JOB	002	009	And when much time had passed, his wife said to him, How long wilt thou hold out, saying, Behold, I wait yet a little while, expecting the hope of my deliverance? for, behold, thy memorial is abolished from the earth, [even thy] sons and daughters, the pangs and pains of my womb which I bore in vain with sorrows; and thou thyself sittest down to spend the nights in the open air among the corruption of worms, and I am a wanderer and a servant from place to place and house to house, waiting for the setting of the sun, that I may rest from my labours and my pangs which now beset me: but say some word against the Lord, and die.
018	JOB	002	010	But he looked on her, and said to her, Thou hast spoken like one of the foolish women. If we have received good things of the hand of the Lord, shall we not endure evil things? In all these things that happened to him, Job sinned not at all with his lips before God.
018	JOB	002	011	Now his three friends having heard of all the evil that was come upon him, came to him each from his own country: Eliphaz the king of the Thaemans, Baldad sovereign of the Saucheans, Sophar king of he Minaeans: and they came to him with one accord, to comfort and to visit him.
018	JOB	002	012	And when they saw him from a distance they did not know him; and they cried with a loud voice, and wept, and rent every one his garment, and sprinkled dust upon [their heads],
018	JOB	002	013	and they sat down beside him seven days and seven nights, and no one of them spoke; for they saw that his affliction was dreadful and very great.
018	JOB	003	001	After this Job opened his mouth, and cursed his day,
018	JOB	003	002	saying,
018	JOB	003	003	Let the day perish in which I was born, and that night in which they said, Behold a man-child!
018	JOB	003	004	Let that night be darkness, and let not the Lord regard it from above, neither let light come upon it.
018	JOB	003	005	But let darkness and the shadow of death seize it; let blackness come upon it;
018	JOB	003	006	let that day and night be cursed, let darkness carry them away; let it not come into the days of the year, neither let it be numbered with the days of the months.
018	JOB	003	007	But let that night be pain, and let not mirth come upon it, nor joy.
018	JOB	003	008	But let him that curses that day curse it, [even] he that is ready to attack the great whale.
018	JOB	003	009	Let the stars of that night be darkened; let it remain [dark], and not come into light; and let it not see the morning star arise:
018	JOB	003	010	because it shut not up the gates of my mother's womb, for [so] it would have removed sorrow from my eyes.
018	JOB	003	011	For why died I not in the belly? and [why] did I not come forth from the womb and die immediately?
018	JOB	003	012	and why did the knees support me? and why did I suck the breasts?
018	JOB	003	013	Now I should have lain down and been quiet, I should have slept and been at rest,
018	JOB	003	014	with kings [and] councillors of the earth, who gloried in [their] swords;
018	JOB	003	015	or with rulers, whose gold was abundant, who filled their houses with silver:
018	JOB	003	016	or [I should have been] as an untimely birth proceeding from his mother's womb, or as infants who never saw light.
018	JOB	003	017	There the ungodly have burnt out the fury of rage; there the wearied in body rest.
018	JOB	003	018	And the men of old time have together ceased to hear the exactor's voice.
018	JOB	003	019	The small and great are there, and the servant that feared his lord.
018	JOB	003	020	For why is light given to those who are in bitterness, and life to those souls which are in griefs?
018	JOB	003	021	who desire death, and obtain it not, digging [for it] as [for] treasures;
018	JOB	003	022	and would be very joyful if they should gain it?
018	JOB	003	023	Death [is] rest to [such] a man, for God has hedged him in.
018	JOB	003	024	For my groaning comes before my food, and I weep being beset with terror.
018	JOB	003	025	For the terror of which I meditated has come upon me, and that which I had feared has befallen me.
018	JOB	003	026	I was not at peace, nor quiet, nor had I rest; yet wrath came upon me.
018	JOB	004	001	Then Eliphaz the Thaemanite answered and said,
018	JOB	004	002	Hast thou been often spoken to in distress? but who shall endure the force of thy words?
018	JOB	004	003	For whereas thou hast instructed many, and hast strengthened the hands of the weak one,
018	JOB	004	004	and hast supported the failing with words, and hast imparted courage to feeble knees.
018	JOB	004	005	Yet now [that] pain has come upon thee, and touched thee, thou art troubled.
018	JOB	004	006	Is not thy fear [founded] in folly, thy hope also, and the mischief of thy way?
018	JOB	004	007	Remember then who has perished, being pure? or when were the true-hearted utterly destroyed?
018	JOB	004	008	Accordingly as I have seen men ploughing barren places, and they that sow them will reap sorrows for themselves.
018	JOB	004	009	They shall perish by the command of the Lord, and shall be utterly consumed by the breath of his wrath.
018	JOB	004	010	The strength of the lion, and the voice of the lioness, and the exulting cry of serpents are quenched.
018	JOB	004	011	The old lion has perished for want of food, and the lions' whelps have forsaken one another.
018	JOB	004	012	But if there had been any truth in thy words, none of these evils would have befallen thee. Shall not mine ear receive excellent [revelations] from him?
018	JOB	004	013	But [as when] terror falls upon men, with dread and a sound in the night,
018	JOB	004	014	horror and trembling seized me, and caused all my bones greatly to shake.
018	JOB	004	015	And a spirit came before my face; and my hair and flesh quivered.
018	JOB	004	016	I arose and perceived it not: I looked, and there, was no form before my eyes: but I only heard a breath and a voice, [saying],
018	JOB	004	017	What, shall a mortal be pure before the Lord? or a man be blameless in regard to his works?
018	JOB	004	018	Whereas he trust not in his servants, and perceives perverseness in his angels.
018	JOB	004	019	But [as for] them that dwell in houses of clay, of whom we also are formed of the same clay, he smites them like a moth.
018	JOB	004	020	And from the morning to evening they no longer exist: they have perished, because they cannot help themselves.
018	JOB	004	021	For he blows upon them, and they are withered: they have perished for lack of wisdom.
018	JOB	005	001	But call, if any one will hearken to thee, or if thou shalt see any of the holy angels.
018	JOB	005	002	For wrath destroys the foolish one, and envy slays him that has gone astray.
018	JOB	005	003	And I have seen foolish ones taking root: but suddenly their habitation was devoured.
018	JOB	005	004	Let their children be far from safety, and let them be crushed at the doors of vile men, and let there be no deliverer.
018	JOB	005	005	For what they have collected, the just shall eat; but they shall not be delivered out of calamities: let their strength be utterly exhausted.
018	JOB	005	006	For labour cannot by any means come out of the earth, nor shall trouble spring out of the mountains:
018	JOB	005	007	yet man is born to labour, and [even so] the vulture's young seek the high places.
018	JOB	005	008	Nevertheless I will beseech the Lord, and will call upon the Lord, the sovereign of all;
018	JOB	005	009	who does great things and untraceable, glorious things also, and marvellous, of which there is no number:
018	JOB	005	010	who gives rain upon the earth, sending water on the earth:
018	JOB	005	011	who exalts the lowly, and raises up them that are lost:
018	JOB	005	012	frustrating the counsels of the crafty, and their hands shall not perform the truth:
018	JOB	005	013	who takes the wise in their wisdom, and subverts the counsel of the crafty
018	JOB	005	014	In the day darkness shall come upon them, and let them grope in the noon-day even as in the night:
018	JOB	005	015	and let them perish in war, and let the weak escape from the hand of the mighty.
018	JOB	005	016	And let the weak have hope, but the mouth of the unjust be stopped.
018	JOB	005	017	But blessed [is] the man whom the Lord has reproved; and reject not thou the chastening of the Almighty.
018	JOB	005	018	for he causes [a man] to be in pain, and restores [him] again: he smites, and his hands heal.
018	JOB	005	019	Six time he shall deliver thee out of distresses: and in the seventh harm shall not touch thee.
018	JOB	005	020	In famine he shall deliver thee from death: and in war he shall free thee from the power of the sword.
018	JOB	005	021	He shall hide thee from the scourge of the tongue: and thou shalt not be afraid of coming evils.
018	JOB	005	022	Thou shalt laugh at the unrighteous and the lawless: and thou shalt not be afraid of wild beasts.
018	JOB	005	023	For the wild beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.
018	JOB	005	024	Then shalt thou know that thy house shall be at peace, and the provision for thy tabernacle shall not fail.
018	JOB	005	025	And thou shalt know that thy seed [shall be] abundant; and thy children shall be like the herbage of the field.
018	JOB	005	026	And thou shalt come to the grave like ripe corn reaped in its season, or as a heap of the corn-flour collected in proper time.
018	JOB	005	027	Behold, we have thus sought out these matters; these are what we have heard: but do thou reflect with thyself, if thou hast done anything [wrong].
018	JOB	006	001	But Job answered and said,
018	JOB	006	002	Oh that one would indeed weigh the wrath that is upon me, and take up my griefs in a balance together!
018	JOB	006	003	And verily they would be heavier than the sand by the seashore: but, as it seems, my words are vain.
018	JOB	006	004	For the arrows of the Lord are in my body, whose violence drinks up my blood: whenever I am going to speak, they pierce me.
018	JOB	006	005	What then? will the wild ass bray for nothing, if he is not seeking food? or again, will the ox low at the manger, when he has a fodder?
018	JOB	006	006	Shall bread be eaten without salt? or again, is there taste in empty words?
018	JOB	006	007	For my wrath cannot cease; for I perceive my food as the smell of a lion [to be] loathsome.
018	JOB	006	008	For oh that he would grant [my desire], and my petition might come, and the Lord would grant my hope!
018	JOB	006	009	Let the Lord begin and wound me, but let him not utterly destroy me.
018	JOB	006	010	Let the grave be my city, upon the walls of which I have leaped: I will not shrink from it; for I have not denied the holy words of my God.
018	JOB	006	011	For what is my strength, that I continue? what is my time, that my soul endures?
018	JOB	006	012	Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh of brass?
018	JOB	006	013	Or have I not trusted in him? but help is [far] from me.
018	JOB	006	014	Mercy has rejected me; and the visitation of the Lord has disregarded me.
018	JOB	006	015	My nearest relations have not regarded me; they have passed me by like a failing brook, or like a wave.
018	JOB	006	016	They who used to reverence me, now have come against me like snow or congealed ice.
018	JOB	006	017	When it has melted at the approach of heat, it is not known what it was.
018	JOB	006	018	Thus I also have been deserted of all; and I am ruined, and become an outcast.
018	JOB	006	019	Behold the ways of the Thaemanites, ye that mark the paths of the Sabaeans.
018	JOB	006	020	They too that trust in cities and riches shall come to shame.
018	JOB	006	021	But ye also have come to me without pity; so that beholding my wound ye are afraid.
018	JOB	006	022	What? have I made any demand of you? or do I ask for strength from you,
018	JOB	006	023	to deliver me from enemies, or to rescue me from the hand of the mighty ones?
018	JOB	006	024	Teach ye me, and I will be silent: if in anything I have erred, tell me.
018	JOB	006	025	But as it seems, the words of a true man are vain, because I do not ask strength of you.
018	JOB	006	026	Neither will your reproof cause me to cease my words, for neither will I endure the sound of your speech.
018	JOB	006	027	Even because ye attack the fatherless, and insult your friend.
018	JOB	006	028	But now, having looked upon your countenances, I will not lie.
018	JOB	006	029	Sit down now, and let there not be unrighteousness; and unite again with the just.
018	JOB	006	030	For there is no injustice in my tongue; and does not my throat meditate understanding?
018	JOB	007	001	Is not the life of man upon earth a state of trial? and his existence as that of a hireling by the day?
018	JOB	007	002	Or as a servant that fears his master, and one who has grasped a shadow? or as a hireling waiting for his pay?
018	JOB	007	003	So have I also endured months of vanity, and nights of pain have been appointed me.
018	JOB	007	004	Whenever I lie down, I say, When [will it be] day? and whenever I rise up, again [I say] when [will it be] evening? and I am full of pains from evening to morning.
018	JOB	007	005	And my body is covered with loathsome worms; and I waste away, scraping off clods of dust from my eruption.
018	JOB	007	006	And my life is lighter than a word, and has perished in vain hope.
018	JOB	007	007	Remember then that my life is breath, and mine eye shalt not yet again see good.
018	JOB	007	008	The eye of him that sees me shall not see me [again]: thine eyes are upon me, and I am no more.
018	JOB	007	009	[I am] as a cloud that is cleared away from the sky: for if a man go down to the grave, he shall not come up again:
018	JOB	007	010	and he shall surely not return to his own house, neither shall his place know him any more.
018	JOB	007	011	Then neither will I refrain my mouth: I will speak being in distress; being in anguish I will disclose the bitterness of my soul.
018	JOB	007	012	Am I a sea, or a serpent, that thou hast set a watch over me?
018	JOB	007	013	I said that my bed should comfort me, and I would privately counsel with myself on my couch.
018	JOB	007	014	Thou scarest me with dreams, and dost terrify me with visions.
018	JOB	007	015	Thou wilt separate life from my spirit; and yet [keep] my bones from death.
018	JOB	007	016	For I shall not live for ever, that I should patiently endure: depart from me, for my life [is] vain.
018	JOB	007	017	For what is man, that thou hast magnified him? or that thou givest heed to him?
018	JOB	007	018	Wilt thou visit him till the morning, and judge him till [the time of] rest?
018	JOB	007	019	How long dost thou not let me alone, nor let me go, until I shall swallow down my spittle?
018	JOB	007	020	If I have sinned, what shall I be able to do, O thou that understandest the mind of men? why hast thou made me as thine accuser, and [why] am I a burden to thee?
018	JOB	007	021	Why hast thou not forgotten my iniquity, and purged my sin? but now I shall depart to the earth; and in the morning I am no more.
018	JOB	008	001	Then Baldad the Sauchite answered, and said,
018	JOB	008	002	How long wilt thou speak these things, [how long shall] the breath of thy mouth [be] abundant in words?
018	JOB	008	003	Will the Lord be unjust when he judges; or will he that has made all things pervert justice?
018	JOB	008	004	If thy sons have sinned before him, he has cast them away because of their transgression.
018	JOB	008	005	But be thou early in prayer to the Lord Almighty.
018	JOB	008	006	If thou art pure and true, he will hearken to thy supplication, and will restore to thee the habitation of righteousness.
018	JOB	008	007	Though then thy beginning should be small, yet thy end should be unspeakably great.
018	JOB	008	008	For ask of the former generation, and search diligently among the race of [our] fathers:
018	JOB	008	009	(for we are of yesterday, and know nothing; for our life upon the earth is a shadow:)
018	JOB	008	010	shall not these teach thee, and report [to thee], and bring out words from [their] heart?
018	JOB	008	011	Does the rush flourish without water, or shall the flag grow up without moisture?
018	JOB	008	012	When it is yet on the root, and [though] it has not been cut down, does not any herb wither before it has received moisture?
018	JOB	008	013	Thus then shall be the end of all that forget the Lord: for the hope of the ungodly shall perish.
018	JOB	008	014	For his house shall be without inhabitants, and his tent shall prove a spider's web.
018	JOB	008	015	If he should prop up his house, it shall not stand: and when he has taken hold of it, it shall not remain.
018	JOB	008	016	For it is moist under the sun, and his branch shall come forth out of his dung-heap.
018	JOB	008	017	He lies down upon a gathering of stones, and shall live in the mist of flints.
018	JOB	008	018	If [God] should destroy [him], his place shall deny him. Hast thou not seen such things,
018	JOB	008	019	that such is the overthrow of the ungodly? and out of the earth another shall grow.
018	JOB	008	020	For the Lord will by no means reject the harmless man; but he will not receive any gift of the ungodly.
018	JOB	008	021	But he will fill with laughter the mouth of the sincere, and their lips with thanksgiving.
018	JOB	008	022	But their adversaries shall clothe themselves with shame; and the habitation of the ungodly shall perish.
018	JOB	009	001	Then Job answered and said,
018	JOB	009	002	I know of a truth that it is so: for how shall a mortal man be just before the Lord?
018	JOB	009	003	For if he would enter into judgment with him, [God] would not hearken to him, so that he should answer to one of his charges of a thousand.
018	JOB	009	004	For he is wise in mind, and mighty, and great: who has hardened himself against him and endured?
018	JOB	009	005	Who wears out the mountains, and [men] know it not: who overturns them in anger.
018	JOB	009	006	Who shakes the [earth] under heaven from its foundations, and its pillars totter.
018	JOB	009	007	Who commands the sun, and it rises not; and he seals up the stars.
018	JOB	009	008	Who alone has stretched out the heavens, and walks on the sea as on firm ground.
018	JOB	009	009	Who makes Pleias, and Hesperus, and Arcturus, and the chambers of the south.
018	JOB	009	010	Who does great and unsearchable things; glorious also and excellent things, innumerable.
018	JOB	009	011	If ever he should go beyond me, I shall not see him: if he should pass by me, neither thus have I known [it].
018	JOB	009	012	If he would take away, who shall turn him back? or who shall say to him, What hast thou done?
018	JOB	009	013	For [if] he has turned away [his] anger, the whales under heaven have stooped under him.
018	JOB	009	014	Oh then that he would hearken to me, or judge my cause.
018	JOB	009	015	For though I be righteous, he will not hearken to me: I will intreat his judgment.
018	JOB	009	016	And if I should call and he should not hearken, I cannot believe that he has listened to my voice.
018	JOB	009	017	Let him not crush me with a dark storm: but he has made by bruises many without cause.
018	JOB	009	018	For he suffers me not to take breath, but he has filled me with bitterness.
018	JOB	009	019	For indeed he is strong in power: who then shall resist his judgment?
018	JOB	009	020	For though I should seem righteous, my mouth will be profane: and though I should seem blameless, I shall be proved perverse.
018	JOB	009	021	For even if I have sinned, I know it not [in] my soul: but my life is taken away.
018	JOB	009	022	Wherefore I said, Wrath slays the great and mighty man.
018	JOB	009	023	For the worthless die, but the righteous are laughed to scorn.
018	JOB	009	024	For they are delivered into the hands of the unrighteous [man]: he covers the faces of the judges [of the earth]: but if it be not he, who is it?
018	JOB	009	025	But my life is swifter than a post: [my days] have fled away, and they knew it not.
018	JOB	009	026	Or again, is there a trace of [their] path [left] by ships? or is there one of the flying eagle as it seeks [its] prey?
018	JOB	009	027	And if I should say, I will forget to speak, I will bow down my face and groan;
018	JOB	009	028	I quake in all my limbs, for I know that thou wilt not leave me alone [as] innocent.
018	JOB	009	029	But since I am ungodly, why have I not died?
018	JOB	009	030	For if I should wash myself with snow, and purge myself with pure hands,
018	JOB	009	031	thou hadst thoroughly plunged me in filth, and my garment had abhorred me.
018	JOB	009	032	For thou art not man like me, with whom I could contend, that we might come together to judgment.
018	JOB	009	033	Would that [he] our mediator were [present], and a reprover, and one who should hear [the cause] between both.
018	JOB	009	034	Let him remove [his] rod from me, and let not his fear terrify me:
018	JOB	009	035	so shall I not be afraid, but I will speak: for I am not thus conscious [of guilt].
018	JOB	010	001	Weary in my soul, I will pour my words with groans upon him: I will speak being straitened in the bitterness of my soul.
018	JOB	010	002	And I will say to the Lord, Do not teach me to be impious; and wherefore hast thou thus judged me?
018	JOB	010	003	Is it good before thee if I be unrighteous? for thou hast disowned the work of thy hands, and attended to the counsel of the ungodly.
018	JOB	010	004	Or dost thou see as a mortal sees? or wilt thou look as a man sees?
018	JOB	010	005	Or is thy life human, or thy years [the years] of a man,
018	JOB	010	006	that thou hast enquired into mine iniquity, and searched out my sins?
018	JOB	010	007	For thou knowest that I have not committed iniquity: but who is he that can deliver out of thy hands?
018	JOB	010	008	Thy hands have formed me and made me; afterwards thou didst change [thy mind], and smite me.
018	JOB	010	009	Remember that thou hast made me [as] clay, and thou dost turn me again to earth.
018	JOB	010	010	Hast thou not poured me out like milk, and curdled me like cheese?
018	JOB	010	011	And thou didst clothe me with skin and flesh, and frame me with bones and sinews.
018	JOB	010	012	And thou didst bestow upon me life and mercy, and thy oversight has preserved my spirit.
018	JOB	010	013	Having these things in thyself, I know that thou canst do all things; for nothing is impossible with thee.
018	JOB	010	014	And if I should sin, thou watchest me; and thou hast not cleared me from iniquity.
018	JOB	010	015	Or if I should be ungodly, woe is me: and if I should be righteous, I cannot lift myself up, for I am full of dishonour.
018	JOB	010	016	For I am hunted like a lion for slaughter; for again thou hast changed and art terribly destroying me;
018	JOB	010	017	renewing against me my torture: and thou hast dealt with me in great anger, and thou hast brought trials upon me.
018	JOB	010	018	Why then didst thou bring me out of the womb? and why did I not die, and no eye see me,
018	JOB	010	019	and I become as if I had not been? for why was I not carried from the womb to the grave?
018	JOB	010	020	Is not the time of my life short? suffer me to rest a little,
018	JOB	010	021	before I go whence I shall not return, to a land of darkness and gloominess;
018	JOB	010	022	to a land of perpetual darkness, where there is no light, neither [can any one] see the life of mortals.
018	JOB	011	001	Then Sophar the Minaean answered and said,
018	JOB	011	002	He that speaks much, should also hear on the other side: or does the fluent speaker think himself to be righteous? blessed [is] the short lived offspring of woman.
018	JOB	011	003	Be not a speaker of many words; for is there none to answer thee?
018	JOB	011	004	For say not, I am pure in my works, and blameless before him.
018	JOB	011	005	But oh that the Lord would speak to thee, and open his lips to thee!
018	JOB	011	006	Then shall he declare to thee the power of wisdom; for it shall be double of that which is with thee: and then shalt thou know, that a just recompence of thy sins has come to thee from the Lord.
018	JOB	011	007	Wilt thou find out the traces of the Lord? or hast thou come to the end [of that] which the Almighty has made?
018	JOB	011	008	Heaven [is] high; and what wilt thou do? and there are deeper things than those in hell; what dost thou know?
018	JOB	011	009	Or longer than the measure of the earth, or the breadth of the sea.
018	JOB	011	010	And if he should overthrow all things, who will say to him, What hast thou done?
018	JOB	011	011	For he knows the works of transgressors; and when he sees wickedness, he will not overlook [it].
018	JOB	011	012	But man vainly buoys himself up with words; and a mortal born of woman [is] like an ass in the desert.
018	JOB	011	013	For if thou hast made thine heart pure, and liftest up [thine] hands towards him;
018	JOB	011	014	if there is any iniquity in thy hands, put if far from thee, and let not unrighteousness lodge in thy habitation.
018	JOB	011	015	For thus shall thy countenance shine again, as pure water; and thou shalt divest thyself of uncleanness, and shalt not fear.
018	JOB	011	016	And thou shalt forget trouble, as a wave that has passed by; and thou shalt not be scared.
018	JOB	011	017	And thy prayer [shall be] as the morning star, and life shall arise to thee [as] from the noonday.
018	JOB	011	018	And thou shalt be confident, because thou hast hope; and peace shall dawn to thee from out of anxiety and care.
018	JOB	011	019	For thou shalt be at ease, and there shall be no one to fight against thee; and many shall charge, and make supplication to thee.
018	JOB	011	020	But safety shall fail them; for their hope is destruction, and the eyes of the ungodly shall waste away.
018	JOB	012	001	And Job answered and said,
018	JOB	012	002	So then ye [alone] are men, and wisdom shall die with you?
018	JOB	012	003	[But] I also have a heart as well as you.
018	JOB	012	004	For a righteous and blameless man has become a subject for mockery.
018	JOB	012	005	For it had been ordained that he should fall under others at the appointed time, and that his houses should be spoiled by transgressors: let not however any one trust that, being evil, he shall be [held] guiltless,
018	JOB	012	006	even as many as provoke the Lord, as if there were indeed to be no inquisition [made] of them.
018	JOB	012	007	But ask now the beasts, if they may speak to thee; and the birds of the air, if they may declare to thee.
018	JOB	012	008	Tell the earth, if it may speak to thee: and the fishes of the sea shall explain to thee.
018	JOB	012	009	Who then has not known in all these things, that the hand of the Lord has made them?
018	JOB	012	010	Whereas the life of all living things is in his hand, and the breath of every man.
018	JOB	012	011	For the ear tries words, and the palate tastes meats.
018	JOB	012	012	In length of time is wisdom, and in long life knowledge.
018	JOB	012	013	With him are wisdom and power, with him counsel and understanding.
018	JOB	012	014	If he should cast down, who will build up? if he should shut up against man, who shall open?
018	JOB	012	015	If he should withhold the water, he will dry the earth: and if he should let it loose, he overthrows and destroys it.
018	JOB	012	016	With him are strength and power: he has knowledge and understanding.
018	JOB	012	017	He leads counsellors away captive, and maddens the judges of the earth.
018	JOB	012	018	He seats kings upon thrones, and girds their loins with a girdle.
018	JOB	012	019	He sends away priests into captivity, and overthrows the mighty ones of the earth.
018	JOB	012	020	He changes the lips of the trusty, and he knows the understanding of the elders.
018	JOB	012	021	He pours dishonour upon princes, and heals the lowly.
018	JOB	012	022	Revealing deep things out of darkness: and he has brought into light the shadow of death.
018	JOB	012	023	Causing the nations to wander, and destroying them: overthrowing the nations, and leading them [away].
018	JOB	012	024	Perplexing the minds of the princes of the earth: and he causes them to wander in a way, they have not known, [saying],
018	JOB	012	025	Let them grope [in] darkness, and [let there be] no light, and let them wander as a drunken man.
018	JOB	013	001	Behold, mine eye has seen these things, and mine ear has heard [them].
018	JOB	013	002	And I know all that ye too know; and I have not less understanding than you.
018	JOB	013	003	Nevertheless I will speak to the Lord, and I will reason before him, if he will.
018	JOB	013	004	But ye are all bad physicians, and healers of diseases.
018	JOB	013	005	But would that ye were silent, and it would be wisdom to you in the end.
018	JOB	013	006	But hear ye the reasoning of my mouth, and attend to the judgment of my lips.
018	JOB	013	007	Do ye not speak before the Lord, and utter deceit before him?
018	JOB	013	008	Or will ye draw back? nay do, ye yourselves be judges.
018	JOB	013	009	For [it were] well if he would thoroughly search you: for though doing all things [in your power] ye should attach yourselves to him,
018	JOB	013	010	he will not reprove you at all the less: but if moreover ye should secretly respect persons,
018	JOB	013	011	shall not his whirlpool sweep you round, and terror from him fall upon you?
018	JOB	013	012	And your glorying shall prove in the end to you like ashes, and your body [like a body] of clay.
018	JOB	013	013	Be silent, that I may speak, and cease from [mine] anger,
018	JOB	013	014	while I may take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in my hand.
018	JOB	013	015	Though the Mighty One should lay hand upon me, forasmuch as he has begun, verily I will speak, and plead before him.
018	JOB	013	016	And this shall turn to me for salvation; for fraud shall have no entrance before him.
018	JOB	013	017	Hear, hear ye my words, for I will declare in your hearing.
018	JOB	013	018	Behold, I am near my judgment: I know that I shall appear evidently just.
018	JOB	013	019	For who is he that shall plead with me, that I should now be silent, and expire?
018	JOB	013	020	But grant me two things: then I will not hide myself from thy face.
018	JOB	013	021	Withhold [thine] hand from me: and let not thy fear terrify me.
018	JOB	013	022	Then shalt thou call, and I will hearken to thee: or thou shalt speak, and I will give thee an answer.
018	JOB	013	023	How many are my sins and my transgressions? teach me what they are.
018	JOB	013	024	Wherefore hidest thou thyself from me, and deemest me thine enemy?
018	JOB	013	025	Wilt thou be startled [at me], as [at] a leaf shaken by the wind? or wilt thou set thyself against me as against grass borne upon the breeze?
018	JOB	013	026	for thou hast written evil things against me, and thou hast compassed me with the sins of my youth.
018	JOB	013	027	And thou hast placed my foot in the stocks; and thou hast watched all my works, and hast penetrated my heels.
018	JOB	013	028	[I am as] that which waxes old like a bottle, or like a moth-eaten garment.
018	JOB	014	001	For a mortal born of a woman [is] short lived, and full of wrath.
018	JOB	014	002	Or he falls like a flower that has bloomed; and he departs like a shadow, and cannot continue.
018	JOB	014	003	Hast thou not taken account even of him, and caused him to enter into judgment before thee?
018	JOB	014	004	For who shall be pure from uncleanness? not even one;
018	JOB	014	005	if even his life should be [but] one day upon the earth: and his months are numbered by him: thou hast appointed [him] for a time, and he shall by no means exceed [it].
018	JOB	014	006	Depart from him, that he may be quiet, and take pleasure in his life, [though] as a hireling.
018	JOB	014	007	For there is hope for a tree, even if it should be cut down, [that] it shall blossom again, and its branch shall not fail.
018	JOB	014	008	For though its root should grow old in the earth, and its stem die in the rock;
018	JOB	014	009	it will blossom from the scent of water, and will produce a crop, as one newly planted.
018	JOB	014	010	But a man that has died is utterly gone; and when a mortal has fallen, he is no more.
018	JOB	014	011	For the sea wastes in [length of] time, and a river fails and is dried up.
018	JOB	014	012	And man that has lain down [in death] shall certainly not rise again till the heaven be dissolved, and they shall not awake from their sleep.
018	JOB	014	013	For oh that thou hadst kept me in the grave, and hadst hidden me until thy wrath should cease, and thou shouldest set me a time in which thou wouldest remember me!
018	JOB	014	014	For if a man should die, shall he live [again], having accomplished the days of his life? I will wait till I exist again?
018	JOB	014	015	Then shalt thou call, and I will hearken to thee: but do not thou reject the work of thine hands.
018	JOB	014	016	But thou hast numbered my devices: and not one of my sins shall escape thee?
018	JOB	014	017	An thou hast sealed up my transgressions in a bag, and marked if I have been guilty of any transgression unawares.
018	JOB	014	018	And verily a mountain falling will utterly be destroyed, and a rock shall be worn out of its place.
018	JOB	014	019	The waters wear the stones, and waters falling headlong [overflow] a heap of the earth: and thou destroyest the hope of man.
018	JOB	014	020	Thou drivest him to an end, and he is gone: thou settest thy face against him, and sendest him away;
018	JOB	014	021	and though his children be multiplied, he knows [it] not; and if they be few, he is not aware.
018	JOB	014	022	But his flesh is in pain, and his soul mourns.
018	JOB	015	001	Then Eliphaz the Thaemanite answered and said,
018	JOB	015	002	Will a wise man give for answer a [mere] breath of wisdom? and does he fill up the pain of his belly,
018	JOB	015	003	reasoning with improper sayings, and with words wherein is no profit?
018	JOB	015	004	Hast not thou moreover cast off fear, and accomplished such words before the Lord?
018	JOB	015	005	Thou art guilty by the words of thy mouth, neither hast thou discerned the words of the mighty.
018	JOB	015	006	Let thine own mouth, and not me, reprove thee: and thy lips shall testify against thee.
018	JOB	015	007	What! art thou the first man that was born? or wert thou established before the hills?
018	JOB	015	008	Or hast thou heard the ordinance of the Lord? or has God used thee as [his] counsellor? and has wisdom come [only] to thee?
018	JOB	015	009	For what knowest thou, that, we know not? or what understandest thou, which we do not also?
018	JOB	015	010	Truly among us [are] both the old and very aged man, more advanced in days than thy father.
018	JOB	015	011	Thou hast been scourged for [but] few of thy sins: thou hast spoken haughtily [and] extravagantly.
018	JOB	015	012	What has thine heart dared? or what have thine eyes [aimed at],
018	JOB	015	013	that thou hast vented [thy] rage before the Lord, and delivered such words from [thy] mouth?
018	JOB	015	014	For who, being a mortal, [is such] that he shall be blameless? or, [who that is] born of a woman, that he should be just?
018	JOB	015	015	Forasmuch as he trusts not his saints; and the heaven is not pure before him.
018	JOB	015	016	Alas then, abominable and unclean is man, drinking unrighteousness as a draught.
018	JOB	015	017	But I will tell thee, hearken to me; I will tell thee now what I have seen;
018	JOB	015	018	things wise men say, and their fathers have not hidden.
018	JOB	015	019	To them alone the earth was given, and no stranger came upon them.
018	JOB	015	020	All the life of the ungodly [is spent] in care, and the years granted to the oppressor are numbered.
018	JOB	015	021	And his terror is in his ears: just when he seems to be at peace, his overthrow will come.
018	JOB	015	022	Let him not trust that he shall return from darkness, for he has been already made over to the power of the sword.
018	JOB	015	023	And he has been appointed to be food for vultures; and he knows within himself that he is doomed to be a carcass: and a dark day shall carry him away as with a whirlwind.
018	JOB	015	024	Distress also and anguish shall come upon him: he shall fall as a captain in the first rank.
018	JOB	015	025	For he has lifted his hands against the Lord, and he has hardened his neck against the Almighty Lord.
018	JOB	015	026	And he has run against him with insolence, on the thickness of the back of his shield.
018	JOB	015	027	For he has covered his face with his fat, and made layers of fat upon his thighs.
018	JOB	015	028	And let him lodge in desolate cities, and enter into houses without inhabitant: and what they have prepared, others shall carry away.
018	JOB	015	029	Neither shall he at all grow rich, nor shall his substance remain: he shall not cast a shadow upon the earth.
018	JOB	015	030	Neither shall he in any wise escape the darkness: let the wind blast his blossom, and let his flower fall off.
018	JOB	015	031	Let him not think that he shall endure; for his end shall be vanity.
018	JOB	015	032	His harvest shall perish before the time, and his branch shall not flourish.
018	JOB	015	033	And let him be gathered as the unripe grape before the time, and let him fall as the blossom of the olive.
018	JOB	015	034	For death is the witness of an ungodly man, and fire shall burn the houses of them that receive gifts.
018	JOB	015	035	And he shall conceive sorrows, and his end shall be vanity, and his belly shall bear deceit.
018	JOB	016	001	But Job answered and said,
018	JOB	016	002	I have heard many such things: poor comforters are ye all.
018	JOB	016	003	What! is there any reason in vain words? or what will hinder thee from answering?
018	JOB	016	004	I also will speak as ye [do]: if indeed your soul were in my [soul's] stead, then would I insult you with words, and I would shake my head at you.
018	JOB	016	005	And would there were strength in my mouth, and I would not spare the movement of my lips.
018	JOB	016	006	For if I should speak, I shall not feel the pain of my wound: and if I should be silent, how shall I be wounded the less?
018	JOB	016	007	But now he has made me weary, and a worn-out fool; and thou hast laid hold of me.
018	JOB	016	008	My falsehood has become a testimony, and has risen up against me: it has confronted me to my face.
018	JOB	016	009	In his anger he has cast me down; he has gnashed his teeth upon me: the weapons of his robbers have fallen upon me.
018	JOB	016	010	He has attacked me with the keen glances of his eyes; with his sharp [spear] he has smitten me [down] upon my knees; and they have run upon me with one accord.
018	JOB	016	011	For the Lord has delivered me into the hands of unrighteous men, and thrown me upon the ungodly.
018	JOB	016	012	When I was at peace he distracted me: he took me by the hair of the head, and plucked it out: he set me up as a mark.
018	JOB	016	013	They surrounded me with spears, aiming at my reins: without sparing [me] they poured out my gall upon the ground.
018	JOB	016	014	They overthrew me with fall upon fall: they ran upon me in [their] might.
018	JOB	016	015	They sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and my strength has been spent on the ground.
018	JOB	016	016	My belly has been parched with wailing, and darkness is on my eyelids.
018	JOB	016	017	Yet there was no injustice in my hands, and my prayer is pure.
018	JOB	016	018	Earth, cover not over the blood of my flesh, and let my cry have no place.
018	JOB	016	019	And now, behold, my witness is in heaven, and my advocate is on high.
018	JOB	016	020	Let my supplication come to the Lord, and let mine eye weep before him.
018	JOB	016	021	Oh that a man might plead before the Lord, even [as] the son of man with his neighbor!
018	JOB	016	022	But my years are numbered and [their end] come, and I shall go by the way by which I shall not return.
018	JOB	017	001	I perish, carried away by the wind, and I seek for burial, and obtain [it] not.
018	JOB	017	002	Weary I intreat; and what have I done? and strangers have stolen my goods.
018	JOB	017	003	Who is this? let him join hands with me.
018	JOB	017	004	For thou hast hid their heart from wisdom; therefore thou shalt not exalt them.
018	JOB	017	005	He shall promise mischief to [his] companions: but [their] eyes have failed for [their] children.
018	JOB	017	006	But thou has made me a byword amount the nations, and I am become a scorn to them.
018	JOB	017	007	For my eyes are dimmed through pain; I have been grievously beset by all.
018	JOB	017	008	Wonder has seized true men upon this; and let the just rise up against the transgressor.
018	JOB	017	009	But let the faithful hold on his own way, and let him that is pure of hands take courage.
018	JOB	017	010	Howbeit, do ye all strengthen [yourselves] and come now, for I do not find truth in you.
018	JOB	017	011	My days have passed in groaning, and my heart-strings are broken.
018	JOB	017	012	I have turned the night into day: the light is short because of darkness.
018	JOB	017	013	For if I remain, Hades is my habitation: and my bed has been made in darkness.
018	JOB	017	014	I have called upon death to be my father, and corruption [to be] my mother and sister.
018	JOB	017	015	Where then is yet my hope? or [where] shall I see my good?
018	JOB	017	016	Will they go down with me to Hades, or shall we go down together to the tomb?
018	JOB	018	001	Then Baldad the Sauchite answered and said,
018	JOB	018	002	How long wilt thou continue? forbear, that we also may speak.
018	JOB	018	003	For wherefore have we been silent before thee like brutes?
018	JOB	018	004	Anger has possessed thee: for what if thou shouldest die; would [the earth] under heaven be desolate? or shall the mountains be overthrown from their foundations?
018	JOB	018	005	But the light of the ungodly shall be quenched, and their flame shall not go up.
018	JOB	018	006	His light [shall be] darkness in [his] habitation, and his lamp shall be put out with him.
018	JOB	018	007	Let the meanest of men spoil his goods, and let his counsel deceive [him].
018	JOB	018	008	His foot also has been caught in a snare, [and] let it be entangled in a net.
018	JOB	018	009	And let snares come upon him: he shall strengthen those that thirst for his destruction.
018	JOB	018	010	His snare is hid in the earth, and that which shall take him is by the path.
018	JOB	018	011	Let pains destroy him round about, and let many [enemies] come about him,
018	JOB	018	012	[vex him] with distressing hunger: and a signal destruction has been prepared for him.
018	JOB	018	013	Let the soles of his feet be devoured: and death shall consume his beauty.
018	JOB	018	014	And let health be utterly banished from his tabernacle, and let distress seize upon him with a charge from the king.
018	JOB	018	015	It shall dwell in his tabernacle in his night: his excellency shall be sown with brimstone.
018	JOB	018	016	His roots shall be dried up from beneath, and his crop shall fall away from above.
018	JOB	018	017	Let his memorial perish out of the earth, and his name shall be publicly cast out.
018	JOB	018	018	Let [one] drive him from light into darkness.
018	JOB	018	019	He shall not be known among his people, nor his house preserved on the earth.
018	JOB	018	020	But strangers shall dwell in his possessions: the last groaned for him, and wonder seized the first.
018	JOB	018	021	These are the houses of the unrighteous, and this is the place of them that know not the Lord.
018	JOB	019	001	Then Job answered and said,
018	JOB	019	002	How long will ye vex my soul, and destroy me with words? only know that the Lord has dealt with me thus.
018	JOB	019	003	Ye speak against me; ye do not feel for me, but bear hard upon me.
018	JOB	019	004	Yea verily, I have erred in truth, (but the error abides with myself) in having spoken words which it was not right [to speak]; and my words err, and are unreasonable.
018	JOB	019	005	But alas! for ye magnify yourselves against me, and insult me with reproach.
018	JOB	019	006	Know then that it is the Lord that has troubled [me], and has raised his bulwark against me.
018	JOB	019	007	Behold, I laugh at reproach; I will not speak: [or] I will cry out, but [there is] nowhere judgment.
018	JOB	019	008	I am fenced round about, and can by no means escape: he has set darkness before my face.
018	JOB	019	009	And he has stripped me of my glory, and has taken the crown from my head.
018	JOB	019	010	He has torn me around about, and I am gone: and he has cut off my hope like a tree.
018	JOB	019	011	And he has dreadfully handled me in anger, and has counted me for an enemy.
018	JOB	019	012	His troops also came upon me with one accord, liars in wait compassed my ways.
018	JOB	019	013	My brethren have stood aloof from me; they have recognized strangers [rather] than me: and my friends have become pitiless.
018	JOB	019	014	My nearest of kin have not acknowledged me, and they that knew my name, have forgotten me.
018	JOB	019	015	[As for] my household, and my maid-servants, I was a stranger before them.
018	JOB	019	016	I called my servant, and he hearkened not; and my mouth intreated [him].
018	JOB	019	017	And I besought my wife, and earnestly intreated the sons of my concubines.
018	JOB	019	018	But they rejected me for ever; whenever I rise up, they speak against me.
018	JOB	019	019	They that saw me abhorred me: the very persons whom I had loved, rose up against me.
018	JOB	019	020	My flesh is corrupt under my skin, and my bones are held in [my] teeth.
018	JOB	019	021	Pity me, pity me, O friends; for it is the hand of the Lord that has touched me.
018	JOB	019	022	Wherefore do ye persecute me as also the Lord [does], and are not satisfied with my flesh?
018	JOB	019	023	For oh that my words were written, and that they were recorded in a book forever,
018	JOB	019	024	with an iron pen and lead, or graven in the rocks!
018	JOB	019	025	For I know that he is eternal who is about to deliver me,
018	JOB	019	026	[and] to raise up upon the earth my skin that endures these [sufferings]: for these things have been accomplished to me of the Lord;
018	JOB	019	027	which I am conscious of in myself, which mine eye has seen, and not another, but all have been fulfilled to me in [my] bosom.
018	JOB	019	028	But if ye shall also say, What shall we say before him, and [so] find the root of the matter in him?
018	JOB	019	029	Do ye also beware of deceit: for wrath will come upon transgressors; and then shall they know where their substance is.
018	JOB	020	001	Then Sophar the Minaean answered and said,
018	JOB	020	002	I did not suppose that thou wouldest answer thus: neither do ye understand more than I.
018	JOB	020	003	I will hear my shameful reproach; and the spirit of my understanding answers me.
018	JOB	020	004	Hast thou [not] known these things of old, from the time that man was set upon the earth?
018	JOB	020	005	But the mirth of the ungodly is a signal downfall, and the joy of transgressors is destruction:
018	JOB	020	006	although his gifts should go up to heaven, and his sacrifice reach the clouds.
018	JOB	020	007	For when he shall seem to be now established, then he shall utterly perish: and they that knew him shall say, Where is he?
018	JOB	020	008	Like a dream that has fled away, he shall not be found; and he has fled like a vision of the night.
018	JOB	020	009	The eye has looked upon him, but shall not [see him] again; and his place shall no longer perceive him.
018	JOB	020	010	Let [his] inferiors destroy his children, and let his hands kindle the fire of sorrow.
018	JOB	020	011	His bones have been filled with [vigour of] his youth, and it shall lie down with him in the dust.
018	JOB	020	012	Though evil be sweet in his mouth, [though] he will hide it under his tongue;
018	JOB	020	013	though he will not spare it, and will not leave it, but will keep it in the midst of his throat:
018	JOB	020	014	yet he shall not at all be able to help himself; the gall of an asp is in his belly.
018	JOB	020	015	[His] wealth unjustly collected shall be vomited up; a messenger [of wrath] shall drag him out of his house.
018	JOB	020	016	And let him suck the poison of serpents, and let the serpent's tongue slay him.
018	JOB	020	017	Let him not see the milk of the pastures, nor the supplies of honey and butter.
018	JOB	020	018	He has laboured unprofitably and in vain, [for] wealth of which he shall not taste: [it is] as a lean thing, unfit for food, which he cannot swallow.
018	JOB	020	019	For he has broken down the houses of many mighty men: and he has plundered an habitation, though he built [it] not.
018	JOB	020	020	There is no security to his possessions; he shall not be saved by his desire.
018	JOB	020	021	There is nothing remaining of his provisions; therefore his goods shall not flourish.
018	JOB	020	022	But when he shall seem to be just satisfied, he shall be straitened; and all distress shall come upon him.
018	JOB	020	023	If by any means he would fill his belly, let [God] send upon him the fury of wrath; let him bring a torrent of pains upon him.
018	JOB	020	024	And he shall by no means escape from the power of the sword; let the brazen bow wound him.
018	JOB	020	025	And let the arrow pierce through his body; and let the stars be against his dwelling-place: let terrors come upon him.
018	JOB	020	026	And let all darkness wait for him: a fire that burns not out shall consume him; and let a stranger plague his house.
018	JOB	020	027	And let the heaven reveal his iniquities, and the earth rise up against him.
018	JOB	020	028	Let destruction bring his house to an end; let a day of wrath come upon him.
018	JOB	020	029	This is the portion of an ungodly man from the Lord, and the possession of his goods [appointed him] by the all-seeing [God].
018	JOB	021	001	But Job answered and said,
018	JOB	021	002	Hear ye, hear ye my words, that I may not have this consolation from you.
018	JOB	021	003	Raise me, and I will speak; then ye shall not laugh me to scorn.
018	JOB	021	004	What! is my reproof of man? and why should I not be angry?
018	JOB	021	005	Look upon me, and wonder, laying your hand upon your cheek.
018	JOB	021	006	For even when I remember, I am alarmed, and pains seize my flesh.
018	JOB	021	007	Wherefore do the ungodly live, and grow old even in wealth?
018	JOB	021	008	Their seed is according to [their] desire, and their children are in [their] sight.
018	JOB	021	009	Their houses are prosperous, neither [have they] any where [cause for] fear, neither is there a scourge from the Lord upon them.
018	JOB	021	010	Their cow does not cast her calf, and their [beast] with young is safe, and does not miscarry.
018	JOB	021	011	And they remain as an unfailing flock, and their children play before [them], taking up the psaltery and harp;
018	JOB	021	012	and they rejoice at the voice of a song.
018	JOB	021	013	And they spend their days in wealth, and fall asleep in the rest of the grave.
018	JOB	021	014	Yet [such a man] says to the Lord, Depart from me; I desire not to know thy ways.
018	JOB	021	015	What is the Mighty One, that we should serve him? and what profit is there that we should approach him?
018	JOB	021	016	For their good things were in [their] hands, but he regards not the works of the ungodly.
018	JOB	021	017	Nevertheless, the lamp of the ungodly also shall be put out, and destruction shall come upon them, and pangs of vengeance shall seize them.
018	JOB	021	018	And they shall be as chaff before the wind, or as dust which the storm has taken up.
018	JOB	021	019	Let his substance fail [to supply] his children: [God] shall recompense him, and he shall know it.
018	JOB	021	020	Let his eyes see his own destruction, and let him not be saved by the Lord.
018	JOB	021	021	For his desire is in his house with him, and the number of his months has been suddenly cut off.
018	JOB	021	022	Is it not the Lord who teaches understanding and knowledge? and does not he judge murders?
018	JOB	021	023	One shall die in his perfect strength, and wholly at ease and prosperous;
018	JOB	021	024	and his inwards are full of fat, and his marrow is diffused [throughout him].
018	JOB	021	025	And another dies in bitterness of soul, not eating any good thing.
018	JOB	021	026	But they lie down in the earth together, and corruption covers them.
018	JOB	021	027	So I know you, that ye presumptuously attack me:
018	JOB	021	028	so that ye will say, Where is the house of the prince? and where is the covering of the tabernacles of the ungodly?
018	JOB	021	029	Ask those that go by the way, and do not disown their tokens.
018	JOB	021	030	For the wicked hastens to the day of destruction: they shall be led away for the day of his vengeance.
018	JOB	021	031	Who will tell him his way to his face, whereas he has done [it]? who shall recompense him?
018	JOB	021	032	And he has been led away to the tombs, and he has watched over the heaps.
018	JOB	021	033	The stones of the valley have been sweet to him, and every man shall depart after him, and [there are] innumerable [ones] before him.
018	JOB	021	034	How then do ye comfort me in vain? whereas I have no rest from your molestation.
018	JOB	022	001	Then Eliphaz the Thaemanite answered and said,
018	JOB	022	002	Is it not the Lord that teaches understanding and knowledge?
018	JOB	022	003	For what matters it to the Lord, if thou wert blameless in [thy] works? or is it profitable that thou shouldest perfect thy way?
018	JOB	022	004	Wilt thou maintain and plead thine own cause? and will he enter into judgment with thee?
018	JOB	022	005	Is not thy wickedness abundant, and thy sins innumerable?
018	JOB	022	006	And thou hast taken security of thy brethren for nothing, and hast taken away the clothing of the naked.
018	JOB	022	007	Neither hast thou given water to the thirsty to drink, but hast taken away the morsel of the hungry.
018	JOB	022	008	And thou hast accepted the persons of some; and thou hast established those [that were already settled] on the earth.
018	JOB	022	009	But thou hast sent widows away empty, and has afflicted orphans.
018	JOB	022	010	Therefore snares have compassed thee, and disastrous war has troubled thee.
018	JOB	022	011	The light has proved darkness to thee, and water has covered thee on thy lying down.
018	JOB	022	012	Does not he that dwells in the high places observe? and has he not brought down the proud?
018	JOB	022	013	And thou has said, What does the Mighty One know? does he judge in the dark?
018	JOB	022	014	A cloud is his hiding-place, and he shall not be seen; and he passes through the circle of heaven.
018	JOB	022	015	Wilt thou [not] mark the old way, which righteous men have trodden?
018	JOB	022	016	who were seized before their time: their foundations [are as] an overflowing stream.
018	JOB	022	017	Who say, What will the Lord do to us? or what will the Almighty bring upon us?
018	JOB	022	018	Yet he filled their houses with good things: but the counsel for the wicked is far from him.
018	JOB	022	019	The righteous have seen [it], and laughed, and the blameless one has derided [them].
018	JOB	022	020	Verily their substance has been utterly destroyed, and the fire shall devour what is left of their [property].
018	JOB	022	021	Be firm, I pray thee, if thou canst endure; then thy fruit shall prosper.
018	JOB	022	022	And receive a declaration from his mouth, and lay up his words in thine heart.
018	JOB	022	023	And if thou shalt turn and humble thyself before the Lord, thou hast [thus] removed unrighteousness far from thy habitation.
018	JOB	022	024	Thou shalt lay up for thyself [treasure] in a heap on the rock; and Sophir [shall be] as the rock of the torrent.
018	JOB	022	025	So the Almighty shall be thy helper from enemies, and he shall bring thee forth pure as silver that has been tried by fire.
018	JOB	022	026	Then shalt thou have boldness before the Lord, looking up cheerfully to heaven.
018	JOB	022	027	And he shall hear thee when thou prayest to him, and he shall grant thee [power] to pay thy vows.
018	JOB	022	028	And he shall establish to thee again a habitation of righteousness and there shall be light upon thy paths.
018	JOB	022	029	Because thou hast humbled thyself; and thou shalt say, [Man] has behaved proudly, but he shall save him that is of lowly eyes.
018	JOB	022	030	He shall deliver the innocent, and do thou save thyself by thy pure hands.
018	JOB	023	001	Then Job answered and said,
018	JOB	023	002	Yea, I know that pleading is out of my reach; and his hand has been made heavy upon my groaning.
018	JOB	023	003	Who would then know that I might find him, and come to an end [of the matter]?
018	JOB	023	004	And I would plead my own cause, and he would fill my mouth with arguments.
018	JOB	023	005	And I would know the remedies which he would speak to me, and I would perceive what he would tell me.
018	JOB	023	006	Though he should come on me in [his] great strength, then he would not threaten me;
018	JOB	023	007	for truth and reproof are from him; and he would bring forth my judgment to an end.
018	JOB	023	008	For if I shall go first, and exist no longer, still what do I know [concerning] the latter end?
018	JOB	023	009	When he wrought on the left hand, then I observed [it] not: his right hand shall encompass me but I shall not see [it].
018	JOB	023	010	For he knows already my way; and he has tried me as gold.
018	JOB	023	011	And I will go forth according to his commandments, for I have kept his ways; and I shall not turn aside from his commandments,
018	JOB	023	012	neither shall I transgress; but I have hid his words in my bosom.
018	JOB	023	013	And if too he has thus judged, who is he that has contradicted, for he has both willed [a thing] and done it.
018	JOB	023	015	Therefore am I troubled at him; and when I was reproved, I thought of him. Therefore let me take good heed before him: I will consider, and be afraid of him.
018	JOB	023	016	But the Lord has softened my heart, and the Almighty has troubled me.
018	JOB	023	017	For I knew not that darkness would come upon me, and thick darkness has covered [me] before my face.
018	JOB	024	001	But why have the seasons been hidden from the Lord,
018	JOB	024	002	while the ungodly have passed over the bound, carrying off the flock with the shepherd?
018	JOB	024	003	They have led away, the ass of the fatherless, and taken the widow's ox for a pledge.
018	JOB	024	004	They have turned aside the weak from the right way: and the meek of the earth have hidden themselves together.
018	JOB	024	005	And they have departed like asses in the field, having gone forth on my account according to their own order: his bread is sweet to [his] little ones.
018	JOB	024	006	They have reaped a field that was not their own before the time: the poor have laboured in the vineyards of the ungodly without pay and without food.
018	JOB	024	007	They have caused many naked to sleep without clothes, and they have taken away the covering of their body.
018	JOB	024	008	They are wet with the drops of the mountains: they have embraced the rock, because they had no shelter.
018	JOB	024	009	They have snatched the fatherless from the breast, and have afflicted the outcast.
018	JOB	024	010	And they have wrongfully caused [others] to sleep without clothing, and taken away the morsel of the hungry.
018	JOB	024	011	They have unrighteously laid wait in narrow places, and have not known the righteous way.
018	JOB	024	012	Who have cast forth [the] poor from the city and their own houses, and the soul of the children has groaned aloud.
018	JOB	024	013	Why then has he not visited these? forasmuch as they were upon the earth, and took no notice, and they knew not the way of righteousness, neither have they walked in their [appointed] paths?
018	JOB	024	014	But having known their works, he delivered them into darkness: and in the night one will be as a thief:
018	JOB	024	015	and the eye of the adulterer has watched [for] the darkness, saying, Eye shall not perceive me, and he puts a covering on his face.
018	JOB	024	016	In darkness he digs through houses: by day they conceal themselves securely: they know not the light.
018	JOB	024	017	For the morning is to them all [as] the shadow of death, for [each] will be conscious of the terror of the shadow of death.
018	JOB	024	018	He is swift on the face of the water: let his portion be cursed on the earth; and let their plants be laid bare.
018	JOB	024	019	[Let them be] withered upon the earth; for they have plundered the sheaves of the fatherless.
018	JOB	024	020	Then is his sin brought to remembrance, and he vanishes like a vapour of dew: but let what he has done be recompensed to him, and let every unrighteous one be crushed like rotten wood.
018	JOB	024	021	For he has not treated the barren woman well, and has had no pity on a feeble woman.
018	JOB	024	022	And in wrath he has overthrown the helpless: therefore when he has arisen, [a man] will not feel secure of his own life.
018	JOB	024	023	When he has fallen sick, let him not hope to recover: but let him perish by disease.
018	JOB	024	024	For his exaltation has hurt many; but he has withered as mallows in the heat, or as an ear of corn falling off of itself from the stalk.
018	JOB	024	025	But if not, who is he that says I speak falsely, and will make my words of no account?
018	JOB	025	001	Then Baldad the Sauchite answered and said,
018	JOB	025	002	What beginning or fear is his—even he that makes all things in the highest?
018	JOB	025	003	For let none think that there is a respite for robbers: and upon whom will there not come a snare from him?
018	JOB	025	004	For how shall a mortal be just before the Lord? or who that is born of a woman shall purify himself?
018	JOB	025	005	If he gives an order to the moon, then it shines not; and the stars are not pure before him.
018	JOB	025	006	But alas! man is corruption, and the son of man a worm.
018	JOB	026	001	But Job answered and said,
018	JOB	026	002	To whom dost thou attach thyself, or whom art thou going to assist? is it not he that [has] much strength, and [he] who has a strong arm?
018	JOB	026	003	To whom hast thou given counsel? is it not to him who has all wisdom? whom wilt thou follow? is it not one who has the greatest power?
018	JOB	026	004	To whom hast thou uttered words? and whose breath is it that has come forth from thee?
018	JOB	026	005	Shall giants be born from under the water and the inhabitants thereof?
018	JOB	026	006	Hell is naked before him, and destruction has no covering.
018	JOB	026	007	He stretches out the north wind upon nothing, and he upon nothing hangs the earth;
018	JOB	026	008	binding water in his clouds, and the cloud is not rent under it.
018	JOB	026	009	He keeps back the face of his throne, stretching out his cloud upon it.
018	JOB	026	010	He has encompassed the face of the water by an appointed ordinance, until the end of light and darkness.
018	JOB	026	011	The pillars of heaven are prostrate and astonished at his rebuke.
018	JOB	026	012	He has calmed the sea with [his] might, and by [his] wisdom the whale has been overthrown.
018	JOB	026	013	And the barriers of heaven fear him, and by a command he has slain the apostate dragon.
018	JOB	026	014	Behold, these are parts of his way; and we will hearken to him at the least intimation of his word: but the strength of his thunder who knows, when he shall employ [it]?
018	JOB	027	001	And Job further continued and said in his parable,
018	JOB	027	002	[As] God lives, who has thus judge me; and the Almighty, who has embittered my soul;
018	JOB	027	003	verily, while my breath is yet in [me], and the breath of God which remains to me is in my nostrils,
018	JOB	027	004	my lips shall not speak evil words, neither shall my soul meditate unrighteous thoughts.
018	JOB	027	005	Far be it from me that I should justify you till I die; for I will not let go my innocence,
018	JOB	027	006	but keeping fast to [my] righteousness I will by no means let it go: for I am not conscious to myself of having done any thing amiss.
018	JOB	027	007	Nay rather, but let mine enemies be as the overthrow of the ungodly, and they that rise up against me, as the destruction of transgressors.
018	JOB	027	008	For what is the hope of the ungodly, that he holds to it? will he indeed trust in the Lord [and] be saved?
018	JOB	027	009	Will God hear his prayer? or, when distress has come upon him,
018	JOB	027	010	has he any confidence before him? or will [God] hear him as he calls upon him?
018	JOB	027	011	Yet now I will tell you what is in the hand of the Lord: I will not lie concerning the things which are with the Almighty.
018	JOB	027	012	Behold, ye all know that ye are adding vanity to vanity.
018	JOB	027	013	This is the portion of an ungodly man from the Lord, and the possession of oppressors shall come upon them from the Almighty.
018	JOB	027	014	And if their children be many, they shall be for slaughter: and if they grow up, they shall beg.
018	JOB	027	015	And they that survive of him shall utterly perish, and no one shall pity their widows.
018	JOB	027	016	Even if he should gather silver as earth, and prepare gold as clay;
018	JOB	027	017	All these things shall the righteous gain, and the truehearted shall possess his wealth.
018	JOB	027	018	And his house is gone like moths, and like a spider's web.
018	JOB	027	019	The rich man shall lie down, and shall not continue: he has opened his eyes, and he is not.
018	JOB	027	020	Pains have come upon him as water, and darkness has carried him away by night.
018	JOB	027	021	And a burning wind shall catch him, and he shall depart, and it shall utterly drive him out of his place.
018	JOB	027	022	And [God] shall cast [trouble] upon him, and not spare: he would fain flee out of his hand.
018	JOB	027	023	He shall cause [men] to clap their hands against them, and shall hiss him out of his place.
018	JOB	028	001	For there is a place for the silver, whence it comes, and a place for the gold, whence it is refined.
018	JOB	028	002	For iron comes out of the earth, and brass is hewn out like stone.
018	JOB	028	003	He has set a bound to darkness, and he searches out every limit: a stone [is] darkness, and the shadow of death.
018	JOB	028	004	There is a cutting off the torrent by reason of dust: so they that forget the right way are weakened; they are removed from [among] men.
018	JOB	028	005	[As for] the earth, out of it shall come bread: under it has been turned up as it were fire.
018	JOB	028	006	Her stones are the place of the sapphire: and [her] dust [supplies] man with gold.
018	JOB	028	007	[There is] a path, the fowl has not known it, neither has the eye of the vulture seen it:
018	JOB	028	008	neither have the sons of the proud trodden it, a lion has not passed upon it.
018	JOB	028	009	He has stretched forth his hand on the sharp [rock], and turned up mountains by the roots:
018	JOB	028	010	and he has interrupted the whirlpools of rivers, and mine eye has seen every precious thing.
018	JOB	028	011	And he has laid bare the depths of rivers, and has brought his power to light.
018	JOB	028	012	But whence has wisdom been discovered? and what is the place of knowledge?
018	JOB	028	013	A mortal has not known its way, neither indeed has it been discovered among men.
018	JOB	028	014	The depth said, It is not in me: and the sea said, It is not with me.
018	JOB	028	015	One shall not give fine gold instead of it, neither shall silver be weighed in exchange for it.
018	JOB	028	016	Neither shall it be compared with gold of Sophir, with the precious onyx and sapphire.
018	JOB	028	017	Gold and crystal shall not be equalled to it, neither shall vessels of gold be its exchange.
018	JOB	028	018	Coral and fine pearl shall not be mentioned: but do thou esteem wisdom above the most precious things.
018	JOB	028	019	The topaz of Ethiopia shall not be equalled to it; it shall not be compared with pure gold.
018	JOB	028	020	Whence then is wisdom found? and of what kind is the place of understanding?
018	JOB	028	021	It has escaped the notice of every man, and has been hidden from the birds of the sky.
018	JOB	028	022	Destruction and Death said, We have heard the report of it.
018	JOB	028	023	God has well ordered the way of it, and he knows the place of it.
018	JOB	028	024	For he surveys the whole [earth] under heaven, knowing the things in the earth:
018	JOB	028	025	all that he has made; the weight of the winds, the measures of the water.
018	JOB	028	026	When he made [them], thus he saw and numbered them, and made a way for the pealing of the thunder.
018	JOB	028	027	Then he saw it, and declared it: he prepared it [and] traced it out.
018	JOB	028	028	And he said to man, Behold, godliness is wisdom: and to abstain from evil is understanding.
018	JOB	029	001	And Job continued and said in his parable,
018	JOB	029	002	Oh that I were as in months past, wherein God preserved me!
018	JOB	029	003	As when his lamp shone over my head; when by his light I walked through darkness.
018	JOB	029	004	[As] when I steadfastly pursued my ways, when God took care of my house.
018	JOB	029	005	When I was very fruitful, and my children were about me;
018	JOB	029	006	when my ways were moistened with butter, and the mountains flowed for me with milk.
018	JOB	029	007	When I went forth early in the city, and the seat was placed for me in the streets.
018	JOB	029	008	The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and all the old men stood up.
018	JOB	029	009	And the great men ceased speaking, and laid their finger on their mouth.
018	JOB	029	010	And they that heard [me] blessed me, and their tongue clave to their throat.
018	JOB	029	011	For the ear heard, and blessed me; and the eye saw me, and turned aside.
018	JOB	029	012	For I saved the poor out of the hand of the oppressor, and helped the fatherless who had no helper.
018	JOB	029	013	Let the blessing of the perishing one come upon me; yea, the mouth of the widow has blessed me.
018	JOB	029	014	Also I put on righteousness, and clothed myself with judgment like a mantle.
018	JOB	029	015	I was the eye of the blind, and the foot of the lame.
018	JOB	029	016	I was the father of the helpless; and I searched out the cause which I knew not.
018	JOB	029	017	And I broke the jaw-teeth of the unrighteous; I plucked the spoil out of the midst of their teeth.
018	JOB	029	018	And I said, My age shall continue as the stem of a palm-tree; I shall live a long while.
018	JOB	029	019	[My] root was spread out by the water, and the dew would lodge on my crop.
018	JOB	029	020	My glory was fresh in me, and by bow prospered in his hand.
018	JOB	029	021	[Men] heard me, and gave heed, and they were silent at my counsel.
018	JOB	029	022	At my word they spoke not again, and they were very gland whenever I spoke to them.
018	JOB	029	023	As the thirsty earth expecting the rain, so they [waited for] my speech.
018	JOB	029	024	Were I to laugh on them, they would not believe [it]; and the light of my face has not failed.
018	JOB	029	025	I chose out their way, and sat chief, and dwelt as a king in the midst of warriors, as one comforting mourners.
018	JOB	030	001	But now the youngest have laughed me to scorn, now they reprove me in [their] turn, whose fathers I set at nought; whom I did not deem worthy [to be with] my shepherd dogs.
018	JOB	030	002	Yea, why had I the strength of their hands? for them the full term [of life] was lost.
018	JOB	030	003	[One is] childless in want and famine, [such as] they that fled but lately the distress and misery of drought.
018	JOB	030	004	Who compass the salt places on the sounding [shore], who had salt [herbs] for their food, and were dishonorable and of no repute, in want of every good thing; who also ate roots of trees by reason of great hunger.
018	JOB	030	005	Thieves have risen up against me,
018	JOB	030	006	whose houses were the caves of the rocks, who lived under the wild shrubs.
018	JOB	030	007	They will cry out among the rustling [bushes].
018	JOB	030	008	[They are] sons of fools and vile men, [whose] name and glory [are] quenched from off the earth.
018	JOB	030	009	But now I am their music, and they have me for a by-word.
018	JOB	030	010	And they stood aloof and abhorred me, and spared not to spit in my face.
018	JOB	030	011	For he has opened his quiver and afflicted me: they also have cast off the restraint of my presence.
018	JOB	030	012	They have risen up against [me] on the right hand of [their] offspring; they have stretched out their foot, and directed against me the ways of their destruction.
018	JOB	030	013	My paths are ruined; for they have stripped off my raiment: he has shot at me with his weapons.
018	JOB	030	014	And he has pleaded against me as he will: I am overwhelmed with pains.
018	JOB	030	015	My pains return upon [me]; my hope is gone like the wind, and my safety as a cloud.
018	JOB	030	016	Even now my life shall be poured forth upon me; and days of anguish seize me.
018	JOB	030	017	And by night my bones are confounded; and my sinews are relaxed.
018	JOB	030	018	With great force [my disease] has taken hold of my garment: it has compassed me as the collar of my coat.
018	JOB	030	019	And thou hast counted me as clay; my portion in dust and ashes.
018	JOB	030	020	And I have cried to thee, but thou hearest me not: but they stood still, and observed me.
018	JOB	030	021	They attacked me also without mercy: thou hast scourged me with a strong hand.
018	JOB	030	022	And thou hast put me to grief, and hast cast me away from safety.
018	JOB	030	023	For I know that death will destroy me: for the earth is the house [appointed] for every mortal.
018	JOB	030	024	Oh then that I might lay hands upon myself, or at least ask another, and he should do this for me.
018	JOB	030	025	Yet I wept over every helpless man; I groaned when I saw a man in distress.
018	JOB	030	026	But I, when I waited for good things, behold, days of evils came the more upon me.
018	JOB	030	027	My belly boiled, and would not cease: the days of poverty prevented me.
018	JOB	030	028	I went mourning without restraint: and I have stood and cried out in the assembly.
018	JOB	030	029	I am become a brother of monsters, and a companion of ostriches.
018	JOB	030	030	And my skin has been greatly blackened, and my bones are burned with heat.
018	JOB	030	031	My harp also has been turned into mourning, and my song into my weeping.
018	JOB	031	001	I made a covenant with mine eyes, and I will not think upon a virgin.
018	JOB	031	002	Now what portion has God given from above? and is there an inheritance [given] of the Mighty One from the highest?
018	JOB	031	003	Alas! destruction to the unrighteous, and rejection to them that do iniquity.
018	JOB	031	004	Will he not see my way, and number all my steps?
018	JOB	031	005	But if I had gone with scorners, and if too my foot has hasted to deceit:
018	JOB	031	006	(for I am weighed in a just balance, and the Lord knows my innocence:)
018	JOB	031	007	if my foot has turned aside out of the way, or if mine heart has followed mine eye, and if too I have touched gifts with my hands;
018	JOB	031	008	then let me sow, and let others eat; and let me be uprooted on the earth.
018	JOB	031	009	If my heart has gone forth after another man's wife, and if I laid wait at her doors;
018	JOB	031	010	then let my wife also please another, and let my children be brought low.
018	JOB	031	011	For the rage of anger is not to be controlled, [in the case] of defiling [another] man's wife.
018	JOB	031	012	For it is a fire burning on every side, and whomsoever it attacks, it utterly destroys.
018	JOB	031	013	And if too I despised the judgment of my servant or [my] handmaid, when they pleaded with me;
018	JOB	031	014	what then shall I do if the Lord should try me? and if also he should at all visit me, can I make an answer?
018	JOB	031	015	Were not they too formed as I also was formed in the womb? yea, we were formed in the same womb.
018	JOB	031	016	But the helpless missed not whatever need they had, and I did not cause the eye of the widow to fail.
018	JOB	031	017	And if too I ate my morsel alone, and did not impart [of it] to the orphan;
018	JOB	031	018	(for I nourished [them] as a father from my youth and guided [them] from my mother's womb.)
018	JOB	031	019	And if too I overlooked the naked as he was perishing, and did not clothe him;
018	JOB	031	020	and if the poor did not bless me, and their shoulders were [not] warmed with the fleece of my lambs;
018	JOB	031	021	if I lifted my hand against an orphan, trusting that my strength was far superior [to his]:
018	JOB	031	022	let them my shoulder start from the blade-bone, and my arm be crushed off from the elbow.
018	JOB	031	023	For the fear of the Lord constrained me, and I cannot bear up by reason of his burden.
018	JOB	031	024	If I made gold my treasure, and if too I trusted the precious stone;
018	JOB	031	025	and if too I rejoiced when my wealth was abundant, and if too I laid my hand on innumerable [treasures]:
018	JOB	031	026	(do we not see the shining sun eclipsed, and the moon waning? for they have not [power to continue]:)
018	JOB	031	027	and if my heart was secretly deceived, and if I have laid my hand upon my mouth and kissed it:
018	JOB	031	028	let this also then be reckoned to me as the greatest iniquity: for I [should] have lied against the Lord Most High.
018	JOB	031	029	And if too I was glad at the fall of mine enemies, and mine heart said, Aha!
018	JOB	031	030	let then mine ear hear my curse, and let me be a byword among my people in my affliction.
018	JOB	031	031	And if too my handmaids have often said, Oh that we might be satisfied with his flesh; (whereas I was very kind:
018	JOB	031	032	for the stranger did not lodge without, and my door was opened to every one that came:)
018	JOB	031	033	or if too having sinned unintentionally, I hid my sin;
018	JOB	031	034	(for I did not stand in awe of a great multitude, so as not to declare boldly before them:) and if too I permitted a poor man to go out of my door with an empty bosom:
018	JOB	031	035	(Oh that I had a hearer,) and if I had not feared the hand of the Lord; and [as to] the written charge which I had against any one,
018	JOB	031	036	I would place [it] as a chaplet on my shoulders, and read it.
018	JOB	031	037	And if I did not read it and return it, having taken nothing from the debtor:
018	JOB	031	038	If at any time the land groaned against me, and if its furrows mourned together;
018	JOB	031	039	and if I ate its strength alone without price, and if I too grieved the heart of the owner of the soil, by taking [aught] from [him]:
018	JOB	031	040	then let the nettle come up to me instead of wheat, and a bramble instead of barley. And Job ceased speaking.
018	JOB	032	001	And his three friends also ceased any longer to answer Job: for Job was righteous before them.
018	JOB	032	002	Then Elius the son of Barachiel, the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram, of the country of Ausis, was angered: and he was very angry with Job, because he justified himself before the Lord.
018	JOB	032	003	And he was also very angry with [his] three friends, because they were not able to return answers to Job, yet set him down for an ungodly man.
018	JOB	032	004	But Elius had forborne to give an answer to Job, because they were older than he.
018	JOB	032	005	And Elius saw that there was no answer in the mouth of the three men; and he was angered in his wrath.
018	JOB	032	006	And Elius the Buzite the son of Barachiel answered and said, I am younger in age, and ye are elder, wherefore I kept silence, fearing to declare to you my own knowledge.
018	JOB	032	007	And I said, It is not time that speaks, though in many years [men] know wisdom:
018	JOB	032	008	but there is a spirit in mortals; and the inspiration of the Almighty is that which teaches.
018	JOB	032	009	The long-lived are not wise [as such]; neither do the aged know judgment.
018	JOB	032	010	Wherefore I said, Hear me, and I will tell you what I know.
018	JOB	032	011	Hearken to my words; for I will speak in your hearing, until ye shall have tried [the matter] with words:
018	JOB	032	012	and I shall understand as far as you; and, behold, there was no one of you that answered Job his words in argument,
018	JOB	032	013	lest ye should say, We have found that we have added wisdom to the Lord.
018	JOB	032	014	And ye have commissioned a man to speak such words.
018	JOB	032	015	They were afraid, they answered no longer; they gave up their speaking.
018	JOB	032	016	I waited, (for I had not spoken,) because they stood still, they answered not.
018	JOB	032	017	And Elius continued, and said, I will again speak,
018	JOB	032	018	for I am full of words, for the spirit of my belly destroys me.
018	JOB	032	019	And my belly is as a skin of sweet wine, bound up [and] ready to burst; or as a brazier's labouring bellows.
018	JOB	032	020	I will speak, that I may open my lips and relieve myself.
018	JOB	032	021	For truly I will not be awed because of man, nor indeed will I be confounded before a mortal.
018	JOB	032	022	For I know not how to respect persons: and if otherwise, even the moths would eat me.
018	JOB	033	001	Howbeit hear, Job, my words, and hearken to my speech.
018	JOB	033	002	For behold, I have opened my mouth, and my tongue has spoken.
018	JOB	033	003	My heart [shall be found] pure by [my] words; and the understanding of my lips shall meditate purity.
018	JOB	033	004	The Divine Spirit is that which formed me, and the breath of the Almighty that which teaches me.
018	JOB	033	005	If thou canst, give me an answer: wait therefore; stand against me, and I [will stand] against thee.
018	JOB	033	006	Thou art formed out of the clay as also I: we have been formed out of the same [substance].
018	JOB	033	007	My fear shall not terrify thee, neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee.
018	JOB	033	008	But thou hast said in mine ears, (I have heard the voice of thy words;) because thou sayest, I am pure, not having sinned;
018	JOB	033	009	I am blameless, for I have not transgressed.
018	JOB	033	010	Yet he has discovered a charge against me, and he has reckoned me as an adversary.
018	JOB	033	011	And he has put my foot in the stocks, and has watched all my ways.
018	JOB	033	012	For how sayest thou, I am righteous, yet he has not hearkened to me? for he that is above mortals is eternal.
018	JOB	033	013	But thou sayest, Why has he not heard every word of my cause?
018	JOB	033	014	For when the Lord speaks once, or a second time,
018	JOB	033	015	[sending] a dream, or in the meditation of the night; (as when a dreadful alarm happens to fall upon men, in slumberings on the bed:)
018	JOB	033	016	then opens he the understanding of men: he scares them with such fearful visions:
018	JOB	033	017	to turn a man from unrighteousness, and he delivers his body from a fall.
018	JOB	033	018	He spares also his soul from death, and [suffers] him not to fall in war.
018	JOB	033	019	And again, he chastens him with sickness on his bed, and the multitude of his bones is benumbed.
018	JOB	033	020	And he shall not be able to take any food, though his soul shall desire meat;
018	JOB	033	021	until his flesh shall be consumed, and he shall shew his bones bare.
018	JOB	033	022	His soul also draws nigh to death, and his life is in Hades.
018	JOB	033	023	Though there should be a thousand messengers of death, not one of them shall wound him: if he should purpose in his heart to turn to the Lord, and declare to man his fault, and shew his folly;
018	JOB	033	024	he will support him, that he should not perish, and will restore his body as [fresh] plaster upon a wall; and he will fill his bones with morrow.
018	JOB	033	025	And he will make his flesh tender as that of a babe, and he will restore him among men in [his] full strength.
018	JOB	033	026	And he shall pray to the Lord, and his prayer shall be accepted of him; he shall enter with a cheerful countenance, with a full expression [of praise]: for he will render to men [their] due.
018	JOB	033	027	Even then a man shall blame himself, saying, What kind of things have I done? and he has not punished me according to the full amount of my sins.
018	JOB	033	028	Deliver my soul, that it may not go to destruction, and my life shall see the light.
018	JOB	033	029	Behold, all these things, the Mighty One works in a threefold manner with a man.
018	JOB	033	030	And he has delivered my soul from death, that my life may praise him in the light.
018	JOB	033	031	Hearken, Job, and hear me: be silent, and I will speak.
018	JOB	033	032	If thou hast words, answer me: speak, for I desire thee to be justified.
018	JOB	033	033	If not, do thou hear me: be silent, and I will teach thee.
018	JOB	034	001	And Elius continued, and said,
018	JOB	034	002	Hear me, ye wise men; hearken, ye that have knowledge.
018	JOB	034	003	For the ear tries words, and the mouth tastes meat.
018	JOB	034	004	Let us choose judgment to ourselves: let us know amount ourselves what is right.
018	JOB	034	005	For Job has said, I am righteous: the Lord has removed my judgment.
018	JOB	034	006	And he has erred in my judgment: my wound is severe without unrighteousness [of mine].
018	JOB	034	007	What man is as Job, drinking scorning like water?
018	JOB	034	008	[saying], I have not sinned, nor committed ungodliness, nor had fellowship with workers of iniquity, to go with the ungodly.
018	JOB	034	009	For thou shouldest not say, There shall be no visitation of a man, whereas [there is] a visitation on him from the Lord.
018	JOB	034	010	Wherefore hear me, ye that are wise in heart: far be it from me to sin before the Lord, and to pervert righteousness before the almighty.
018	JOB	034	011	Yea, he renders to a man accordingly as each of them does, and in a man's path he will find him.
018	JOB	034	012	And thinkest thou that the Lord will do wrong, or will the Almighty who made the earth wrest judgment?
018	JOB	034	013	And who is he that made [the whole world] under heaven, and all things therein?
018	JOB	034	014	For if he would confine, and restrain his spirit with himself;
018	JOB	034	015	all flesh would die together, and every mortal would return to the earth, whence also he was formed.
018	JOB	034	016	Take heed lest he rebuke [thee]: hear this, hearken to the voice of words.
018	JOB	034	017	Behold then the one that hates iniquities, and that destroys the wicked, who is for ever just.
018	JOB	034	018	[He is] ungodly that says to a king, Thou art a transgressor, [that says] to princes, O most ungodly one.
018	JOB	034	019	[Such a one] as would not reverence the face of an honourable man, neither knows how to give honour to the great, so as that their persons should be respected.
018	JOB	034	020	But it shall turn out vanity to them, to cry and beseech a man; for they dealt unlawfully, the poor being turned aside [from their right].
018	JOB	034	021	For he surveys the works of men, and nothing of what they do has escaped him.
018	JOB	034	022	Neither shall there be a place for the workers of iniquity to hide themselves.
018	JOB	034	023	For he will not lay upon a man more [than right].
018	JOB	034	024	For the Lord looks down upon all men, who comprehends unsearchable things, glorious also and excellent things without number.
018	JOB	034	025	Who discovers their works, and will bring night about [upon them], and they shall be brought low.
018	JOB	034	026	And he quite destroys the ungodly, for they are seen before him.
018	JOB	034	027	Because they turned aside from the law of God, and did not regard his ordinances,
018	JOB	034	028	so as to bring before him the cry of the needy; for he will hear the cry of the poor.
018	JOB	034	029	And he will give quiet, and who will condemn? and he will hide his face, and who shall see him? whether [it be done] against a nation, or against a man also:
018	JOB	034	030	causing a hypocrite to be king, because of the waywardness of the people.
018	JOB	034	031	For [there is] one that says to the Mighty One, I have received [blessings]; I will not take a pledge:
018	JOB	034	032	I will see apart from myself: do thou shew me if I have done unrighteousness; I will not do [so] any more.
018	JOB	034	033	Will he take vengeance for it on thee, whereas thou wilt put [it] far [from thee]? for thou shalt choose, and not I; and what thou knowest, speak thou.
018	JOB	034	034	Because the wise in heart shall say this, and a wise man listens to my word.
018	JOB	034	035	But Job has not spoken with understanding, his words are not [uttered] with knowledge.
018	JOB	034	036	Howbeit do thou learn, Job: no longer make answer as the foolish:
018	JOB	034	037	that we add not to our sins: for iniquity will be reckoned against us, if [we] speak many words before the Lord.
018	JOB	035	001	And Elius resumed and said,
018	JOB	035	002	What is this that thou thinkest to be according to right? who art thou that thou hast said, I am righteous before the Lord?
018	JOB	035	003	I will answer thee, and thy three friends.
018	JOB	035	004	Look up to the sky and see; and consider the clouds, how high [they are] above thee.
018	JOB	035	005	If thou hast sinned, what wilt thou do?
018	JOB	035	006	and if too thou hast transgressed much, what canst thou perform?
018	JOB	035	007	And suppose thou art righteous, what wilt thou give him? or what shall he receive of thy hand?
018	JOB	035	008	Thy ungodliness [may affect] a man who is like to thee; or thy righteousness a son of man.
018	JOB	035	009	They that are oppressed of a multitude will be ready to cry out; they will call for help because of the arm of many.
018	JOB	035	010	But none said, Where is God that made me, who appoints the night-watches;
018	JOB	035	011	who makes me to differ from the four-footed beasts of the earth, and from the birds of the sky?
018	JOB	035	012	There they shall cry, and none shall hearken, even because of the insolence of wicked men.
018	JOB	035	013	For the Lord desires not to look on error, for he is the Almighty One.
018	JOB	035	014	He beholds them that perform lawless deeds, and he will save me: and do thou plead before him, if thou canst praise him, as it is [possible] even now.
018	JOB	035	015	For he is not [now] regarding his wrath, nor has he noticed severely any trespass.
018	JOB	035	016	Yet Job vainly opens his mouth, in ignorance he multiplies words.
018	JOB	036	001	And Elius further continued, and said,
018	JOB	036	002	Wait for me yet a little while, that I may teach thee: for there is yet speech in me.
018	JOB	036	003	Having fetched my knowledge from afar, and according to my works,
018	JOB	036	004	I will speak just things truly, and thou shalt not unjustly receive unjust words.
018	JOB	036	005	But know that the Lord will not cast off an innocent man: being mighty in strength of wisdom,
018	JOB	036	006	he will not by any means save alive the ungodly: and he will grant the judgment of the poor.
018	JOB	036	007	He will not turn away his eyes from the righteous, but [they shall be] with kings on the throne: and he will establish them in triumph, and they shall be exalted.
018	JOB	036	008	But they that are bound in fetters shall be holden in cords of poverty.
018	JOB	036	009	And he shall recount to them their works, and their transgressions, for such will act with violence.
018	JOB	036	010	But he will hearken to the righteous: and he has said that they shall turn from unrighteousness.
018	JOB	036	011	If they should hear and serve [him], they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in honour.
018	JOB	036	012	But he preserves not the ungodly; because they are not willing to know the Lord, and because when reproved they were disobedient.
018	JOB	036	013	And the hypocrites in heart will array wrath [against themselves]; they will not cry, because he has bound them.
018	JOB	036	014	Therefore let their soul die in youth, and their life be wounded by messengers [of death].
018	JOB	036	015	Because they afflicted the weak and helpless: and he will vindicate the judgment of the meek.
018	JOB	036	016	And he has also enticed thee out of the mouth of the enemy:
018	JOB	036	017	[there is] a deep gulf [and] a rushing stream beneath it, and thy table came down full of fatness. Judgment shall not fail from the righteous;
018	JOB	036	018	but there shall be wrath upon the ungodly, by reason of the ungodliness of the bribes which they received for iniquities.
018	JOB	036	019	Let not [thy] mind willingly turn thee aside from the petition of the feeble that are in distress.
018	JOB	036	020	And draw not forth all the mighty [men] by night, so that the people should go up instead of them.
018	JOB	036	021	But take heed lest thou do that which is wrong: for of this thou has made choice because of poverty.
018	JOB	036	022	Behold, the Mighty One shall prevail by his strength: for who is powerful as he is?
018	JOB	036	023	And who is he that examines his works? or who can say, he has wrought injustice?
018	JOB	036	024	Remember that his works are great [beyond] those which men have attempted.
018	JOB	036	025	Every man has seen in himself, how many mortals are wounded.
018	JOB	036	026	Behold, the Mighty One is great, and we shall not know [him]: the number of his years is even infinite.
018	JOB	036	027	And the drops of rain are numbered by him, and shall be poured out in rain to form a cloud.
018	JOB	036	028	The ancient [heavens] shall flow, and the clouds overshadow innumerable mortals: he has fixed a time to cattle, and they know the order of rest. [Yet] by all these things thy understanding is not astonished, neither is thy mind disturbed in [thy] body.
018	JOB	036	029	And though one should understand the outspreadings of the clouds, [or] the measure of his tabernacle;
018	JOB	036	030	behold he will stretch his bow against him, and he covers the bottom of the sea.
018	JOB	036	031	For by them he will judge the nations: he will give food to him that has strength.
018	JOB	036	032	He has hidden the light in [his] hands, and given charge concerning it to the interposing [cloud].
018	JOB	036	033	The Lord will declare concerning this [to] his friend: [but there is] a portion also for unrighteousness.
018	JOB	037	001	At this also my heart is troubled, and moved out of its place.
018	JOB	037	002	Hear thou a report by the anger of the Lord's wrath, and a discourse shall come out of his mouth.
018	JOB	037	003	His dominion is under the whole heaven, and his light is at the extremities of the earth.
018	JOB	037	004	After him shall be a cry with a [loud] voice; he shall thunder with the voice of his excellency, yet he shall not cause men to pass away, for one shall hear his voice.
018	JOB	037	005	The Mighty One shall thunder wonderfully with his voice: for he has done great things which we knew not;
018	JOB	037	006	commanding the snow, Be thou upon the earth, and the stormy rain, and the storm of the showers of his might.
018	JOB	037	007	He seals up the hand of every man, that every man may know his own weakness.
018	JOB	037	008	And the wild beasts come in under the covert, and rest in [their] lair.
018	JOB	037	009	Troubles come on out of the secret chambers, and cold from the mountain-tops.
018	JOB	037	010	And from the breath of the Mighty One he will send frost; and he guides the water in whatever way he pleases.
018	JOB	037	011	And [if] a cloud obscures [what is] precious [to him], his light will disperse the cloud.
018	JOB	037	012	And he will carry round the encircling [clouds] by his governance, to [perform] their works: whatsoever he shall command them,
018	JOB	037	013	this has been appointed by him on the earth, whether for correction, [or] for his land, or if he shall find him [an object] for mercy.
018	JOB	037	014	Hearken to this, O Job: stand still, and be admonished of the power of the Lord.
018	JOB	037	015	We know that god has disposed his works, having made light out of darkness.
018	JOB	037	016	And he knows the divisions of the clouds, and the signal overthrows of the ungodly.
018	JOB	037	017	But thy robe is warm, and there is quiet upon the land.
018	JOB	037	018	Wilt thou establish with him [foundations] for the ancient [heavens? they are] strong as a molten mirror.
018	JOB	037	019	Wherefore teach me, what shall we say to him? and let us cease from saying much.
018	JOB	037	020	Have I a book or a scribe my me, that I may stand and put man to silence?
018	JOB	037	021	But the light is not visible to all: it shines afar off in the heavens, as that which is from him in the clouds.
018	JOB	037	022	From the [north] come the clouds shining like gold: in these great are the glory and honour of the Almighty;
018	JOB	037	023	and we do not find another his equal in strength: [as for] him that judges justly, dost thou not think that he listens?
018	JOB	037	024	Wherefore men shall fear him; and the wise also in heart shall fear him.
018	JOB	038	001	And after Elius had ceased from speaking, the Lord spoke to Job through the whirlwind and clouds, [saying],
018	JOB	038	002	Who is this that hides counsel from me, and confines words in [his] heart, and thinks to conceal [them] from me?
018	JOB	038	003	Gird thy loins like a man; and I will ask thee, and do thou answer me.
018	JOB	038	004	Where wast thou when I founded the earth? tell me now, if thou hast knowledge,
018	JOB	038	005	who set the measures of it, if thou knowest? or who stretched a line upon it?
018	JOB	038	006	On what are its rings fastened? and who is he that laid the corner-stone upon it?
018	JOB	038	007	When the stars were made, all my angels praised me with a loud voice.
018	JOB	038	008	And I shut up the sea with gates, when it rushed out, coming forth out its mother's womb.
018	JOB	038	009	And I made a cloud its clothing, and swathed it in mist.
018	JOB	038	010	And I set bounds to it, surrounding it with bars and gates.
018	JOB	038	011	And I said to it, Hitherto shalt thou come, but thou shalt not go beyond, but thy waves shall be confined within thee.
018	JOB	038	012	Or did I order the morning light in thy time; and [did] the morning star [then first] see his appointed place;
018	JOB	038	013	to lay hold of the extremities of the earth, to cast out the ungodly out of it?
018	JOB	038	014	Or didst thou take clay of the ground, and form a living creature, and set it with the power of speech upon the earth?
018	JOB	038	015	And hast thou removed light from the ungodly, and crushed the arm of the proud?
018	JOB	038	016	Or hast thou gone to the source of the sea, and walked in the tracks of the deep?
018	JOB	038	017	And do the gates of death open to thee for fear; and did the porters of hell quake when they saw thee?
018	JOB	038	018	And hast thou been instructed in the breadth of the [whole earth] under heaven? tell me now, what is the extent of it?
018	JOB	038	019	And in what kind of a land does the light dwell? and of what kind is the place of darkness?
018	JOB	038	020	If thou couldest bring me to their [utmost] boundaries, and if also thou knowest their paths;
018	JOB	038	021	I know then that thou wert born at that time, and the number of thy years is great.
018	JOB	038	022	But hast thou gone to the treasures of snow? and hast thou seen the treasures of hail?
018	JOB	038	023	And is there a store [of them], for thee against the time of [thine] enemies, for the day of wars and battle?
018	JOB	038	024	And whence proceeds the frost? or [whence] is the south wind dispersed over the [whole world] under heaven?
018	JOB	038	025	And who prepared a course for the violent rain, and a way for the thunders;
018	JOB	038	026	to rain upon the land where [there is] no man, the wilderness, where there is not a man in it; so as to feed the untrodden and uninhabited [land],
018	JOB	038	027	and cause it to send forth a crop of green herbs?
018	JOB	038	028	Who is the rain's father? and who has generated the drops of dew?
018	JOB	038	029	And out of whose womb comes the ice? and who has produced the frost in the sky,
018	JOB	038	030	which descends like flowing water? who has terrified the face of the ungodly?
018	JOB	038	031	And dost thou understand the band of Pleias, and hast thou opened the barrier of Orion?
018	JOB	038	032	Or wilt thou reveal Mazuroth in his season, and the evening star with his rays? Wilt thou guide them?
018	JOB	038	033	And knowest thou the changes of heaven, or the events which take place together under heaven?
018	JOB	038	034	And wilt thou call a cloud with thy voice, and will it obey thee with a violent shower of much rain?
018	JOB	038	035	And wilt thou send lightnings, and they shall go? and shall they say to thee, What is [thy pleasure]?
018	JOB	038	036	And who has given to women skill in weaving, or knowledge of embroidery?
018	JOB	038	037	And who is he that numbers the clouds in wisdom, and has bowed the heaven [down] to the earth?
018	JOB	038	038	For it is spread out as dusty earth, and I have cemented it as one hewn stone to another.
018	JOB	038	039	And wilt thou hunt a prey for the lions? and satisfy the desires of the serpents?
018	JOB	038	040	For they fear in their lairs, and lying in wait couch in the woods.
018	JOB	038	041	And who has prepared food for the raven? for its young ones wander and cry to the Lord, in search of food.
018	JOB	039	001	[Say] if thou knowest the time of the bringing forth of the wild goats of the rock, and [if] thou hast marked the calving of the hinds:
018	JOB	039	002	and [if] thou has hast numbered the full months of their being with young, and [if] thou hast relieved their pangs:
018	JOB	039	003	and hast reared their young without fear; and wilt thou loosen their pangs?
018	JOB	039	004	Their young will break forth; they will be multiplied with offspring: [their young] will go forth, and will not return to them.
018	JOB	039	005	And who is he that sent forth the wild ass free? and who loosed his bands?
018	JOB	039	006	whereas I made his habitation the wilderness, and the salt land his coverts.
018	JOB	039	007	He laughs to scorn the multitude of the city, and hears not the chiding of the tax-gatherer.
018	JOB	039	008	He will survey the mountains [as] his pasture, and he seeks after every green thing.
018	JOB	039	009	And will the unicorn be willing to serve thee, or to lie down at thy manger?
018	JOB	039	010	And wilt thou bind his yoke with thongs, or will he plough furrows for thee in the plain?
018	JOB	039	011	And dost thou trust him, because his strength is great? and wilt thou commit thy works to him?
018	JOB	039	012	And wilt thou believe that he will return to thee thy seed, and bring [it] in [to] thy threshing-floor?
018	JOB	039	013	The peacock has a beautiful wing: if the stork and the ostrich conceive, [it is worthy of notice],
018	JOB	039	014	for [the ostrich] will leave her eggs in the ground, and warm them on the dust,
018	JOB	039	015	and has forgotten that the foot will scatter them, and the wild beasts of the field trample them.
018	JOB	039	016	She has hardened [herself] against her young ones, as though [she bereaved] not herself: she labours in vain without fear.
018	JOB	039	017	For God has withholden wisdom from her, and not given her a portion in understanding.
018	JOB	039	018	In her season she will lift herself on high; she will scorn the horse and his rider.
018	JOB	039	019	Hast thou invested the horse with strength, and clothed his neck with terror?
018	JOB	039	020	And hast thou clad him in perfect armour, and made his breast glorious with courage?
018	JOB	039	021	He paws exulting in the plain, and goes forth in strength into the plain.
018	JOB	039	022	He laughs to scorn a king as he meets him, and will by no means turn back from the sword.
018	JOB	039	023	The bow and sword resound against him; and [his] rage will swallow up the ground:
018	JOB	039	024	and he will not believe until the trumpet sounds.
018	JOB	039	025	And when the trumpet sounds, he says, Aha! and afar off he smells the war with prancing and neighing.
018	JOB	039	026	And does the hawk remain steady by thy wisdom, having spread out her wings unmoved, looking toward the region of the south?
018	JOB	039	027	And does the eagle rise at thy command, and the vulture remain sitting over his nest,
018	JOB	039	028	on a crag of a rock, and in a secret [place]?
018	JOB	039	029	Thence he seeks food, his eyes observe from far.
018	JOB	039	030	And his young ones roll themselves in blood, and wherever the carcasses may be, immediately they are found.
018	JOB	040	001	And the Lord God answered Job, and said,
018	JOB	040	002	Will [any one] pervert judgment with the Mighty One? and he that reproves God, let him return it for answer.
018	JOB	040	003	And Job answered and said to the Lord,
018	JOB	040	004	Why do I yet plead? being rebuked even while reproving the Lord: hearing such things, whereas I am nothing: and what shall I answer to these [arguments]? I will lay my hand upon my mouth.
018	JOB	040	005	I have spoken once; but I will not do so a second time.
018	JOB	040	006	And the Lord yet again answered and spoke to Job out of the cloud, [saying],
018	JOB	040	007	Nay, gird up now thy loins like a man; and I will ask thee, and do thou answer me.
018	JOB	040	008	Do not set aside my judgment: and dost thou think that I have dealt with thee in any other way, than that thou mightest appear to be righteous?
018	JOB	040	009	Hast thou an arm like the Lord's? or dost thou thunder with a voice like his?
018	JOB	040	010	Assume now a lofty bearing and power; and clothe thyself with glory and honour.
018	JOB	040	011	And send forth messengers with wrath; and lay low every haughty one.
018	JOB	040	012	Bring down also the proud man; and consume at once the ungodly.
018	JOB	040	013	And hide them together in the earth; and fill their faces with shame.
018	JOB	040	014	[Then] will I confess that thy right hand can save [thee].
018	JOB	040	015	But now look at the wild beasts with thee; they eat grass like oxen.
018	JOB	040	016	Behold now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the navel of his belly.
018	JOB	040	017	He sets up his tail like a cypress; and his nerves are wrapped together.
018	JOB	040	018	His sides are sides of brass; and his backbone is [as] cast iron.
018	JOB	040	019	This is the chief of the creation of the Lord; made to be played with by his angels.
018	JOB	040	020	And when he has gone up to a steep mountain, he causes joy to the quadrupeds in the deep.
018	JOB	040	021	He lies under trees of every kind, by the papyrus, and reed, and bulrush.
018	JOB	040	022	And the great trees make a shadow over him with their branches, and [so do] the bushes of the field.
018	JOB	040	023	If there should be a flood, he will not perceive it; he trust that Jordan will rush up into his mouth.
018	JOB	040	024	[Yet one] shall take him in his sight; [one] shall catch [him] with a cord, and pierce his nose.
018	JOB	041	001	But wilt thou catch the serpent with a hook, and put a halter about his nose?
018	JOB	041	002	Or wilt thou fasten a ring in his nostril, and bore his lip with a clasp?
018	JOB	041	003	Will he address thee with a petition? softly, with the voice of a suppliant?
018	JOB	041	004	And will he make a covenant with thee? and wilt thou take him for a perpetual servant?
018	JOB	041	005	And wilt thou play with him as with a bird? or bind him as a sparrow for a child?
018	JOB	041	006	And do the nations feed upon him, and the nations of the Phoenicians share him?
018	JOB	041	007	And all the ships come together would not be able to bear the mere skin of his tail; neither [shall they carry] his head in fishing-vessels.
018	JOB	041	008	But thou shalt lay thy hand upon him [once], remembering the war that is waged by his mouth; and let it not be done any more.
018	JOB	041	009	Hast thou not seen him? and hast thou not wondered at the things said [of him]?
018	JOB	041	010	Dost thou not fear because preparation has been made by me? for who is there that resists me?
018	JOB	041	011	Or who will resist me, and abide, since the whole [world] under heaven is mine?
018	JOB	041	012	I will not be silent because of him: though because of his power [one] shall pity his antagonist.
018	JOB	041	013	Who will open the face of his garment? and who can enter within the fold of his breastplate?
018	JOB	041	014	Who will open the doors of his face? terror is round about his teeth.
018	JOB	041	015	His inwards are as brazen plates, and the texture of his [skin] as a smyrite stone.
018	JOB	041	016	One [part] cleaves fast to another, and the air cannot come between them.
018	JOB	041	017	They will remain united each to the other: they are closely joined, and cannot be separated.
018	JOB	041	018	At his sneezing a light shines, and his eyes are [as] the appearance of the morning star.
018	JOB	041	019	Out of his mouth proceed as it were burning lamps, and as it were hearths of fire are cast abroad.
018	JOB	041	020	Out of his nostrils proceeds smoke of a furnace burning with fire of coals.
018	JOB	041	021	His breath is [as] live coals, and a flame goes out of his mouth.
018	JOB	041	022	And power is lodged in his neck, before him destruction runs.
018	JOB	041	023	The flesh also of his body is joined together: [if one] pours [violence] upon him, he shall not be moved.
018	JOB	041	024	His heart is firm as a stone, and it stands like an unyielding anvil.
018	JOB	041	025	And when he turns, [he is] a terror to the four-footed wild beasts which leap upon the earth.
018	JOB	041	026	If spears should come against him, [men] will effect nothing, [either with] the spear or the breast-plate.
018	JOB	041	027	For he considers iron as chaff, and brass as rotten wood.
018	JOB	041	028	The bow of brass shall not would him, he deems a slinger as grass.
018	JOB	041	029	Mauls are counted as stubble; and he laughs to scorn the waving of the firebrand.
018	JOB	041	030	His lair is [formed of] sharp points; and all the gold of the sea under him is an immense [quantity of] clay.
018	JOB	041	031	He makes the deep boil like a brazen caldron; and he regards the sea as a pot of ointment,
018	JOB	041	032	and the lowest part of the deep as a captive: he reckons the deep as [his] range.
018	JOB	041	033	There is nothing upon the earth like to him, formed to be sported with by my angels.
018	JOB	041	034	He beholds every high thing: and he is king of all that are in the waters.
018	JOB	042	001	Then Job answered and said to the Lord,
018	JOB	042	002	I know that thou canst do all things, and nothing is impossible with thee.
018	JOB	042	003	For who is he that hides counsel from thee? or who keeps back his words, and thinks to hide them from thee? and who will tell me what I knew not, great and wonderful things which I understood not?
018	JOB	042	004	But hear me, O Lord, that I also may speak: and I will ask thee, and do thou teach me.
018	JOB	042	005	I have heard the report of thee by the ear before; but now mine eye has seen thee.
018	JOB	042	006	Wherefore I have counted myself vile, and have fainted: and I esteem myself dust and ashes.
018	JOB	042	007	And it came to pass after the Lord had spoken all these words to Job, [that] the Lord said to Eliphaz the Thaemanite, Thou hast sinned, and thy two friends: for ye have not said anything true before me, as my servant Job [has].
018	JOB	042	008	Now then take seven bullocks, and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and he shall offer a burnt-offering for you. And my servant Job shall pray for you, for I will only accept him: for but his sake, I would have destroyed you, for ye have not spoken the truth against my servant Job.
018	JOB	042	009	So Eliphaz the Thaemanite, and Baldad the Sauchite, and Sophar the Minaean, went and did as the Lord commanded them: and he pardoned their sin for the sake of Job.
018	JOB	042	010	And the Lord prospered Job: and when he prayed also for his friends, he forgave them [their] sin: and the Lord gave Job twice as much, even the double of what he had before.
018	JOB	042	011	And all his brethren and his sisters heard all that had happened to him, and they came to him, and [so did] all that had known him from the first: and they ate and drank with him, and comforted him, and wondered at all that the Lord had brought upon him: and each one gave him a lamb, and four drachms' weight of gold, even of unstamped [gold].
018	JOB	042	012	And the Lord blessed the latter end of Job, [more] than the beginning: and his cattle were fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, a thousand yoke of oxen, a thousand she-asses of the pastures.
018	JOB	042	013	And there were born to him seven sons and three daughters.
018	JOB	042	014	And he called the first Day, and the second Casia, and the third Amalthaea's horn.
018	JOB	042	015	And there were not found in comparison with the daughters of Job, fairer [women] than they in all the world: and their father gave them an inheritance among their brethren.
018	JOB	042	016	And Job lived after [his] affliction a hundred and seventy years: and all the years he lived were two hundred and forty: and Job saw his sons and his sons' sons, the fourth generation.
018	JOB	042	017	And Job died, an old man and full of days.

# BOOK	019	PSA	Psalms	Psalms
019	PSA	001	001	Blessed is the man who has not walked in the counsel of the ungodly, and has not stood in the way of sinners, and has not sat in the seat of evil men.
019	PSA	001	002	But his pleasure is in the law of the Lord; and in his law will he meditate day and night.
019	PSA	001	003	And he shall be as a tree planted by the brooks of waters, which shall yield its fruit in its season, and its leaf shall not fall off; and whatsoever he shall do shall be prospered.
019	PSA	001	004	Not so the ungodly; —not so: but rather as the chaff which the wind scatters away from the face of the earth.
019	PSA	001	005	Therefore the ungodly shall not rise in judgment, nor sinners in the counsel of the just.
019	PSA	001	006	For the Lord knows the way of the righteous; but the way of the ungodly shall perish.
019	PSA	002	001	Wherefore did the heathen rage, and the nations imagine vain things?
019	PSA	002	002	The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers gathered themselves together, against the Lord, and against his Christ;
019	PSA	002	003	[saying], Let us break through their bonds, and cast away their yoke from us.
019	PSA	002	004	He that dwells in the heavens shall laugh them to scorn, and the Lord shall mock them.
019	PSA	002	005	Then shall he speak to them in his anger, and trouble them in his fury.
019	PSA	002	006	But I have been made king by him on Sion his holy mountain,
019	PSA	002	007	declaring the ordinance of the Lord: the Lord said to me, Thou art my Son, to-day have I begotten thee.
019	PSA	002	008	Ask of me, and I will give thee the heathen [for] thine inheritance, and the ends of the earth [for] thy possession.
019	PSA	002	009	Thou shalt rule them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces as a potter's vessel.
019	PSA	002	010	Now therefore understand, ye kings: be instructed, all ye that judge the earth.
019	PSA	002	011	Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice in him with trembling.
019	PSA	002	012	Accept correction, lest at any time the Lord be angry, and ye should perish from the righteous way: whensoever his wrath shall be suddenly kindled, blessed are all they that trust in him.
019	PSA	003	001	A Psalm of David, when he fled from the presence of his son Abessalom. O Lord, why are they that afflict me multiplied? many rise up against me.
019	PSA	003	002	Many say concerning my soul, There is no deliverance for him in his God. (Pause)
019	PSA	003	003	But thou, O Lord, art my helper: my glory, and the one that lifts up my head.
019	PSA	003	004	I cried to the Lord with my voice, and he heard me out of his holy mountain. (Pause)
019	PSA	003	005	I lay down and slept; I awaked; for the Lord will help me.
019	PSA	003	006	I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, who beset me round about.
019	PSA	003	007	Arise, Lord; deliver me, my God: for thou hast smitten all who were without cause mine enemies; thou hast broken the teeth of sinners.
019	PSA	003	008	Deliverance is the Lord's, and thy blessing is upon thy people.
019	PSA	004	001	For the End, a Song of David among [the]Psalms. When I called upon [him], the God of my righteousness heard me: thou hast made room for me in tribulation; pity me, and hearken to my prayer.
019	PSA	004	002	O ye sons of men, how long [will ye be] slow of heart? wherefore do ye love vanity, and seek falsehood? (Pause)
019	PSA	004	003	But know ye that the Lord has done wondrous things for his holy one: the Lord will hear me when I cry to him.
019	PSA	004	004	Be ye angry, and sin not; feel compunction upon your beds for what ye say in your hearts. (Pause)
019	PSA	004	005	Offer the sacrifice of righteousness, and trust in the Lord.
019	PSA	004	006	Many say, Who will shew us good things? the light of thy countenance, O Lord, has been manifested towards us.
019	PSA	004	007	Thou hast put gladness into my heart: they have been satisfied with the fruit of their corn and wine and oil.
019	PSA	004	008	I will both lie down in peace and sleep: for thou, Lord, only hast caused me to dwell securely.
019	PSA	005	001	For the end, a Psalm of David, concerning her that inherits. Hearken to my words, O Lord, attend to my cry.
019	PSA	005	002	Attend to the voice of my supplication, my King, and my God: for to thee, O Lord, will I pray.
019	PSA	005	003	In the morning thou shalt hear my voice: in the morning will I wait upon thee, and will look up.
019	PSA	005	004	For thou art not a god that desires iniquity; neither shall the worker of wickedness dwell with thee.
019	PSA	005	005	Neither shall the transgressors continue in thy sight: thou hatest, O Lord, all them that work iniquity.
019	PSA	005	006	Thou wilt destroy all that speak falsehood: the Lord abhors the bloody and deceitful man.
019	PSA	005	007	But I will enter into thine house in the multitude of thy mercy: I will worship in thy fear toward thy holy temple.
019	PSA	005	008	Lead me, O Lord, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; make my way plain before thy face.
019	PSA	005	009	For there is no truth in their mouth; their heart is vain; their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit.
019	PSA	005	010	Judge them, O God; let them fail of their counsels: cast them out according to the abundance of their ungodliness; for they have provoked thee, O Lord.
019	PSA	005	011	But let all that trust on thee be glad in thee: they shall exult for ever, and thou shalt dwell among them; and all that love thy name shall rejoice in thee.
019	PSA	005	012	For thou, Lord, shalt bless the righteous: thou hast compassed us as with a shield of favour.
019	PSA	006	001	For the End, a Psalm of David among the Hymns for the eighth. O Lord, rebuke me not in thy wrath, neither chasten me in thine anger.
019	PSA	006	002	Pity me, O Lord; for I am weak: heal me, O Lord; for my bones are vexed.
019	PSA	006	003	My soul also is grievously vexed: but thou, O Lord, how long?
019	PSA	006	004	Return, O Lord, deliver my soul: save me for thy mercy's sake.
019	PSA	006	005	For in death no man remembers thee: and who will give thee thanks in Hades?
019	PSA	006	006	I am wearied with my groaning; I shall wash my bed every night; I shall water my couch with tears.
019	PSA	006	007	Mine eye is troubled because of my wrath; I am worn out because of all my enemies.
019	PSA	006	008	Depart from me, all ye that work iniquity; for the Lord has heard the voice of my weeping.
019	PSA	006	009	The Lord has hearkened to my petition; the Lord has accepted my prayer.
019	PSA	006	010	Let all mine enemies be put to shame and sore troubled: let them be turned back and grievously put to shame speedily.
019	PSA	007	001	A Psalm of David, which he sang to the Lord because of the words of Chusi the Benjamite. O Lord my God, in thee have I trusted: save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me.
019	PSA	007	002	Lest at any time [the enemy] seize my soul as a lion, while there is none to ransom, nor to save.
019	PSA	007	003	O Lord my God, if I have done this; (if there is unrighteousness in my hands;)
019	PSA	007	004	if I have requited with evil those who requited me [with good]; may I then perish empty by means of my enemies.
019	PSA	007	005	Let the enemy persecute my soul, an take it; and let him trample my life on the ground, and lay my glory in the dust. (Pause)
019	PSA	007	006	Arise, O Lord, in thy wrath; be exalted in the utmost boundaries of mine enemies: awake, O Lord my God, according to the decree which thou didst command.
019	PSA	007	007	And the congregation of the nations shall compass thee: and for this cause do thou return on high.
019	PSA	007	008	The Lord shall judge the nations: judge me, O Lord, according to my righteousness, and according to my innocence that is in me.
019	PSA	007	009	Oh let the wickedness of sinners come to an end; and [then] thou shalt direct the righteous, O God that searchest the hearts and reins.
019	PSA	007	010	My help is righteous, [coming] from God who saves the upright in heart.
019	PSA	007	011	God is a righteous judge, and strong, and patient, not inflicting vengeance every day.
019	PSA	007	012	If ye will not repent, he will furbish his sword; he has bent his bow, and made it ready.
019	PSA	007	013	And on it he has fitted the instruments of death; he has completed his arrows for the raging ones.
019	PSA	007	014	Behold, he has travailed with unrighteousness, he has conceived trouble, and brought forth iniquity.
019	PSA	007	015	He has opened a pit, and dug it up, and he shall fall into the ditch which he has made.
019	PSA	007	016	His trouble shall return on his own head, and his unrighteousness shall come down on his own crown.
019	PSA	007	017	I will give thanks to the Lord according to his righteousness; I will sing to the name of the Lord most high.
019	PSA	008	001	For the end, concerning the wine-presses, a Psalm of David. O Lord, our Lord, how wonderful is thy name in all the earth! for thy magnificence is exalted above the heavens.
019	PSA	008	002	Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou perfected praise, because of thine enemies; that thou mightest put down the enemy and avenger.
019	PSA	008	003	For I will regard the heavens, the work of thy fingers; the moon and stars, which thou hast established.
019	PSA	008	004	What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou visitest him?
019	PSA	008	005	Thou madest him a little less than angels, thou hast crowned him with glory and honour;
019	PSA	008	006	and thou hast set him over the works of thy hands: thou hast put all things under his feet:
019	PSA	008	007	sheep and all oxen, yea and the cattle of the field;
019	PSA	008	008	the birds of the sky, and the fish of the sea, the [creatures] passing through the paths of the sea.
019	PSA	008	009	O Lord our Lord, how wonderful is thy name in all the earth!
019	PSA	009	001	For the end, a Psalm of David, concerning the secrets of the Son. I will give thanks to thee, O Lord, with my whole heart; I will recount all thy wonderful works.
019	PSA	009	002	I will be glad and exult in thee: I will sing to thy name, O thou Most High.
019	PSA	009	003	When mine enemies are turned back, they shall be feeble and perish at thy presence.
019	PSA	009	004	For thou hast maintained my cause and my right; thou satest on the throne, that judgest righteousness.
019	PSA	009	005	Thou hast rebuked the nations, and the ungodly one has perished; thou hast blotted out their name for ever, even for ever and ever.
019	PSA	009	006	The swords of the enemy have failed utterly; and thou hast destroyed cities: their memorial has been destroyed with a noise,
019	PSA	009	007	but the Lord endures for ever: he has prepared his throne for judgment.
019	PSA	009	008	And he will judge the world in righteousness, he will judge the nations in uprightness.
019	PSA	009	009	The Lord also is become a refuge for the poor, a seasonable help, in affliction.
019	PSA	009	010	And let them that know thy name hope in thee: for thou, O Lord, hast not failed them that diligently seek thee.
019	PSA	009	011	Sing praises to the Lord, who dwells in Sion: declare his dealings among the nations.
019	PSA	009	012	For he remembered them, [in] making inquisition for blood: he has not forgotten the supplication of the poor.
019	PSA	009	013	Have mercy upon me, O Lord; look upon my affliction [which I suffer] of mine enemies, thou that liftest me up from the gates of death:
019	PSA	009	014	that I may declare all thy praises in the gates of the daughter of Sion: I will exult in thy salvation.
019	PSA	009	015	The heathen are caught in the destruction which they planned: in the very snare which they hid is their foot taken.
019	PSA	009	016	The Lord is known as executing judgments: the sinner is taken in the works of his hands. (A song of, Pause)
019	PSA	009	017	Let sinners be driven away into Hades, [even] all the nations that forget God.
019	PSA	009	018	For the poor shall not be forgotten for ever: the patience of the needy ones shall not perish for ever.
019	PSA	009	019	Arise, O Lord, let not man prevail: let the heathen be judged before thee.
019	PSA	009	020	Appoint, O Lord, a lawgiver over them: let the heathen know that they are men. (Pause)
019	PSA	010	001	Why standest thou afar off, O Lord? [why] dost thou overlook [us] in times of need, in affliction?
019	PSA	010	002	While the ungodly one acts proudly, the poor is hotly pursued: [the wicked] are taken in the crafty counsels which they imagine.
019	PSA	010	003	Because the sinner praises himself for the desires of his heart; and the unjust one blesses himself.
019	PSA	010	004	The sinner has provoked the Lord: according to the abundance of his pride he will not seek after [him]: God is not before him.
019	PSA	010	005	His ways are profane at all times; thy judgments are removed from before him: he will gain the mastery over all his enemies.
019	PSA	010	006	For he has said in his heart, I shall not be moved, [continuing] without evil from generation to generation.
019	PSA	010	007	Whose mouth is full of cursing, and bitterness, and fraud: under his tongue are trouble and pain.
019	PSA	010	008	He lies in wait with rich [men] in secret places, in order to slay the innocent: his eyes are set against the poor.
019	PSA	010	009	He lies in wait in secret as a lion in his den: he lies in wait to ravish the poor, to ravish the poor when he draws him [after him]: he will bring him down in his snare.
019	PSA	010	010	He will bow down and fall when he has mastered the poor.
019	PSA	010	011	For he has said in his heart, God has forgotten: he has turned away his face so as never to look.
019	PSA	010	012	Arise, O Lord God; let thy hand be lifted up: forget not the poor.
019	PSA	010	013	Wherefore, has the wicked provoked God? for he has said in his heart, He will not require [it].
019	PSA	010	014	Thou seest [it]; for thou dost observe trouble and wrath, to deliver them into thy hands: the poor has been left to thee; thou wast a helper to the orphan.
019	PSA	010	015	Break thou the arm of the sinner and wicked man: his sin shall be sought for, and shall not be found.
019	PSA	010	016	The Lord shall reign for ever, even for ever and ever: ye Gentiles shall perish out his land.
019	PSA	010	017	The Lord has heard the desire of the poor: thine ear has inclined to the preparation of their heart;
019	PSA	010	018	to plead for the orphan and afflicted, that man may no more boast upon the earth.
019	PSA	011	001	For the end, a Psalm of David. In the Lord I have put my trust: how will ye say to my soul, Flee to the mountains as a sparrow?
019	PSA	011	002	For behold the sinners have bent their [bow], they have prepared their arrows for the quiver, to shoot For privily at the upright in heart.
019	PSA	011	003	For they have pulled down what thou didst frame, but what has the righteous done?
019	PSA	011	004	The Lord is in his holy temple, as for the Lord, his throne is in heaven: his eyes look upon the poor, his eyelids try the sons of men.
019	PSA	011	005	The Lord tries the righteous and the ungodly: and he that loves unrighteousness hates his own soul.
019	PSA	011	006	He shall rain upon sinners snares, fire, and brimstone, and a stormy blast [shall be] the portion of their cup.
019	PSA	011	007	For the Lord [is] righteous, and loves righteousness; his face beholds uprightness.
019	PSA	012	001	For the end, A Psalm of David, upon the eighth. Save me, O Lord; for the godly man has failed; for truth is diminished from among the children of men.
019	PSA	012	002	Every one has spoken vanity to his neighbour: their lips are deceitful, they have spoken with a double heart.
019	PSA	012	003	Let the Lord destroy all the deceitful lips, and the tongue that speaks great words:
019	PSA	012	004	who have said, We will magnify our tongue; our lips are our own: who is Lord of us?
019	PSA	012	005	Because of the misery of the poor, and because of the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, saith the Lord, I will set [them] in safety; I will speak [to them] thereof openly.
019	PSA	012	006	The oracles of the Lord are pure oracles; as silver tried in the fire, proved [in] a furnace of earth, purified seven times.
019	PSA	012	007	Thou, O Lord, shalt keep us, and shalt preserve us, from this generation, and for ever.
019	PSA	012	008	The ungodly walk around: according to thy greatness thou has greatly exalted the sons of men.
019	PSA	013	001	For the end, a Psalm of David. How long, O Lord, wilt thou forget me? for ever? how long wilt thou turn away thy face from me?
019	PSA	013	002	How long shall I take counsel in my soul, [having] sorrows in my heart daily? how long shall my enemy be exalted over me?
019	PSA	013	003	Look on me, hearken to me, O Lord my God: lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep in death;
019	PSA	013	004	lest at any time mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him: my persecutors will exult if ever I should be moved.
019	PSA	013	005	But I have hoped in thy mercy; my heart shall exult in thy salvation.
019	PSA	013	006	I will sing to the Lord who has dealt bountifully with me, and I will sing psalms to the name of the Lord most high.
019	PSA	014	001	For the end, Psalm of David. The fool has said in his heart, There is no God. They have corrupted [themselves], and become abominable in their devices; there is none that does goodness, there is not even so much as one.
019	PSA	014	002	The Lord looked down from heaven upon the sons of men, to see if there were any that understood, or sought after god.
019	PSA	014	003	They are all gone out of the way, they are together become good for nothing, there is none that does good, no not one. Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips: whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness; their feet are swift to shed blood: destruction and misery are in their ways; and the way of peace they have not known: there is no fear of God before their eyes.
019	PSA	014	004	Will not all the workers of iniquity know, who eat up my people as they would eat bread? they have not called upon the Lord.
019	PSA	014	005	There were they alarmed with fear, where there was no fear; for God is in the righteous generation.
019	PSA	014	006	Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the Lord is his hope.
019	PSA	014	007	Who will bring the salvation of Israel out of Sion? when the Lord brings back the captivity of his people, let Jacob exult, and Israel be glad.
019	PSA	015	001	A Psalm of David. O Lord, who shall sojourn in thy tabernacle? and who shall dwell in thy holy mountain?
019	PSA	015	002	He that walks blameless, and works righteousness, who speaks truth in his heart.
019	PSA	015	003	Who has not spoken craftily with is tongue, neither has done evil to his neighbour, nor taken up a reproach against them that dwelt nearest to him.
019	PSA	015	004	In his sight an evil-worker is set at nought, but he honours them that fear the Lord. He swears to his neighbour, and disappoints [him] not.
019	PSA	015	005	He has not lent his money on usury, and has not received bribes against the innocent. He that does these things shall never be moved.
019	PSA	016	001	A writing of David. Keep me, O Lord; for I have hoped in thee.
019	PSA	016	002	I said to the Lord, Thou art my Lord; for thou has no need of my goodness.
019	PSA	016	003	On behalf of the saints that are in his land, he has magnified all his pleasure in them.
019	PSA	016	004	Their weaknesses have been multiplied; afterward they hasted. I will by no means assemble their bloody meetings, neither will I make mention of their names with my lips.
019	PSA	016	005	The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: thou art he that restores my inheritance to me.
019	PSA	016	006	The lines have fallen to me in the best places, yea, I have a most excellent heritage.
019	PSA	016	007	I will bless the Lord who has instructed me; my reins too have chastened me even till night.
019	PSA	016	008	I foresaw the Lord always before my face; for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved.
019	PSA	016	009	Therefore my heart rejoiced an my tongue exulted; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope:
019	PSA	016	010	because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.
019	PSA	016	011	Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou wilt fill me with joy with thy countenance: at thy right hand [there are] delights for ever.
019	PSA	017	001	A prayer of David. Hearken, O Lord of my righteousness, attend to my petition; give ear to my prayer not [uttered] with deceitful lips.
019	PSA	017	002	Let my judgment come forth from thy presence; let mine eyes behold righteousness.
019	PSA	017	003	Thou has proved mine heart; thou hast visited [me] by night; thou hast tried me as with fire, and unrighteousness has not been found in me: [I am purposed] that my mouth shall not speak [amiss].
019	PSA	017	004	As for the works of men, by the words of thy lips I have guarded [myself from] hard ways.
019	PSA	017	005	Direct my steps in thy paths, that my steps slip not.
019	PSA	017	006	I have cried, for thou heardest me, O God: incline thine ear to me, and hearken to my words.
019	PSA	017	007	Shew the marvels of thy mercies, thou that savest them that hope in thee.
019	PSA	017	008	Keep me as the apple of the eye from those that resist thy right hand: thou shalt screen me by the covering of thy wings,
019	PSA	017	009	from the face of the ungodly that have afflicted me: mine enemies have compassed about my soul.
019	PSA	017	010	They have enclosed [themselves with] their own fat: their mouth has spoken pride.
019	PSA	017	011	They have now cast me out and compassed me round about: they have set their eyes [so as] to bow them down to the ground.
019	PSA	017	012	They laid wait for me as a lion ready for prey, and like a lion's whelp dwelling in secret [places].
019	PSA	017	013	Arise, O Lord, prevent them, and cast them down: deliver my soul from the ungodly: [draw] thy sword,
019	PSA	017	014	because of the enemies of thine hand: O Lord, destroy them from the earth; scatter them in their life, though their belly has been filled with thy hidden [treasures]: they have been satisfied with uncleanness, and have left the remnant [of their possessions] to their babes.
019	PSA	017	015	But I shall appear in righteousness before thy face: I shall be satisfied when thy glory appears.
019	PSA	018	001	For the end, [a Psalm] of David, the servant of the Lord; [the words] which he spoke to the Lord, [even] the words of this Song, in the day in which the Lord delivered him out the hand of all his enemies, and out the hand of Saul: and he said: I will love thee, O Lord, my strength.
019	PSA	018	002	The Lord is my firm support, and my refuge, and my deliverer; my God is my helper, I will hope in him; [he is] my defender, and the horn of my salvation, and my helper.
019	PSA	018	003	I will call upon the Lord with praises, and I shall be saved from mine enemies.
019	PSA	018	004	The pangs of death compassed me, and the torrents of ungodliness troubled me exceedingly.
019	PSA	018	005	The pangs of hell came round about me: the snares of death prevented me.
019	PSA	018	006	And when I was afflicted I called upon the Lord, and cried to my God: he heard my voice out of this holy temple, and my cry shall enter before him, [even] into his ears.
019	PSA	018	007	Then the earth shook and quaked, and the foundations of the mountains were disturbed, and were shaken, because God was angry with them.
019	PSA	018	008	There went up a smoke in his wrath, and fire burst into a flame at his presence: coals were kindled at it.
019	PSA	018	009	And he bowed the heaven, and came down: and thick darkness was under his feet.
019	PSA	018	010	And he mounted on cherubs and flew: he flew on the wings of winds.
019	PSA	018	011	And he made darkness his secret place: round about him was his tabernacle, [even] dark water in the clouds of the air.
019	PSA	018	012	At the brightness before him the clouds passed, hail and coals of fire.
019	PSA	018	013	The Lord also thundered from heaven, and the Highest uttered his voice.
019	PSA	018	014	And he sent forth [his] weapons, and scattered them; and multiplied lightnings, and routed them.
019	PSA	018	015	And the springs of waters appeared, and the foundations of the world were exposed, at thy rebuke, O Lord, at the blasting of the breath of thy wrath.
019	PSA	018	016	He sent from on high and took me, he drew me to himself out of many waters.
019	PSA	018	017	He will deliver me from my mighty enemies, and from them that hate me; for they are stronger than I.
019	PSA	018	018	They prevented me in the day of mine affliction: but the Lord was my stay against [them].
019	PSA	018	019	And he brought me out into a wide place: he will deliver me, because he has pleasure in me.
019	PSA	018	020	And the Lord will recompense me according to my righteousness; even according to the purity of my hands will he recompense me.
019	PSA	018	021	For I have kept the way of the Lord and have not wickedly departed from my God.
019	PSA	018	022	For all his judgments were before me, and his ordinances departed not from me.
019	PSA	018	023	And I shall be blameless with hem, and shall keep myself from mine iniquity.
019	PSA	018	024	And the Lord shall recompense me according to my righteousness, and according to the purity of my hands before his eyes.
019	PSA	018	025	With the holy thou wilt be holy; and with the innocent man thou wilt be innocent.
019	PSA	018	026	And with the excellent [man] thou wilt be excellent; and with the perverse thou wilt shew frowardness.
019	PSA	018	027	For thou wilt save the lowly people, and wilt humble the eyes of the proud.
019	PSA	018	028	For thou, O Lord, wilt light my lamp: my God, thou wilt lighten my darkness.
019	PSA	018	029	For by thee shall I be delivered from a troop; and by my God I will pass over a wall.
019	PSA	018	030	[As for] my God, his way is perfect: the oracles of the Lord are tried in the fire; he is a protector of all them that hope in him.
019	PSA	018	031	For who is God but the Lord? and who is a God except our God?
019	PSA	018	032	[It is] God that girds me with strength, and has made my way blameless:
019	PSA	018	033	who strengthens my feet as hart's feet, and sets me upon high places.
019	PSA	018	034	He instructs my hands for war: and thou hast made my arms [as] a brazen bow.
019	PSA	018	035	And thou hast made me secure in my salvation: and thy right hand has helped me, and thy correction has upheld me to the end; yea, thy correction itself shall instruct me.
019	PSA	018	036	Thou has made room for my goings under me, and by footsteps did not fail.
019	PSA	018	037	I will pursue mine enemies, and overtake them; and I will not turn back until they are consumed.
019	PSA	018	038	I will dash them to pieces and they shall not be able to stand: they shall fall under my feet.
019	PSA	018	039	For thou hast girded me with strength for war: thou hast beaten down under me all that rose up against me.
019	PSA	018	040	And thou has made mine enemies turn their backs before me; and thou hast destroyed them that hated me.
019	PSA	018	041	They cried, but there was no deliverer: [even] to the Lord, but he hearkened not to them.
019	PSA	018	042	I will grind them as the mud of the streets: and I will beat them small as dust before the wind.
019	PSA	018	043	Deliver me from the gain sayings of the people: thou shalt make me head of the Gentiles: a people whom I knew not served me,
019	PSA	018	044	at the hearing of the ear they obeyed me: the strange children lied to me.
019	PSA	018	045	The strange children waxed old, and fell away from their paths through lameness.
019	PSA	018	046	The Lord lives; and blessed [be] my God; and let the God of my salvation be exalted.
019	PSA	018	047	[It is] God that avenges me, and has subdued the nations under me;
019	PSA	018	048	my deliverer from angry enemies: thou shalt set me on high above them that rise up against me: thou shalt deliver me from the unrighteous man.
019	PSA	018	049	Therefore will I confess to thee, O Lord, among the Gentiles, and sing to thy name.
019	PSA	018	050	[God] magnifies the deliverances of his king; and deals mercifully with David his anointed, and his seed, for ever.
019	PSA	019	001	For the end, a Psalm of David. The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament proclaims the work of his hands.
019	PSA	019	002	Day to day utters speech, and night to night proclaims knowledge.
019	PSA	019	003	There are no speeches or words, in which their voices are not heard.
019	PSA	019	004	Their voice is gone out into all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world.
019	PSA	019	005	In the sun he has set his tabernacle; and he comes forth as a bridegroom out of his chamber: he will exult as a giant to run his course.
019	PSA	019	006	His going forth is from the extremity of heaven, and his circuit to the [other] end of heaven: and no one shall be hidden from his heat.
019	PSA	019	007	The law of the Lord is perfect, converting souls: the testimony of the Lord is faithful, instructing babes.
019	PSA	019	008	The ordinances of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the Lord is bright, enlightening the eyes.
019	PSA	019	009	The fear of the Lord is pure, enduring for ever and ever: the judgments of the Lord are true, [and] justified altogether.
019	PSA	019	010	To be desired more than gold, and much precious stone: sweeter also than honey and the honey-comb.
019	PSA	019	011	For thy servant keeps to them: in the keeping of them [there is] great reward.
019	PSA	019	012	Who will understand [his] transgressions? purge thou me from my secret [sins].
019	PSA	019	013	And spare thy servant [the attack] of strangers: if they do not gain the dominion over me, then shall I be blameless, and I shall be clear from great sin.
019	PSA	019	014	So shall the sayings of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be pleasing continually before thee, O Lord my helper, and my redeemer.
019	PSA	020	001	For the end, a Psalm of David. The Lord hear thee in the day of trouble; the name of the God of Jacob defend thee.
019	PSA	020	002	Send thee help from the sanctuary, and aid thee out of Sion.
019	PSA	020	003	Remember all thy sacrifice, and enrich thy whole-burnt-offering. (Pause)
019	PSA	020	004	Grant thee according to thy heart, and fulfill all thy desire.
019	PSA	020	005	We will exult in thy salvation, and in the name of our God shall we be magnified: the Lord fulfil all thy petitions.
019	PSA	020	006	Now I know that the Lord has saved his Christ: he shall hear him from his holy heaven: the salvation of his right hand is mighty.
019	PSA	020	007	Some [glory] in chariots, and some in horses: but we will glory in the name of the Lord our God.
019	PSA	020	008	They are overthrown and fallen: but we are risen, and have been set upright.
019	PSA	020	009	O Lord, save the king: and hear us in whatever day we call upon thee.
019	PSA	021	001	For the end, a Psalm of David. O Lord, the king shall rejoice in thy strength; and in thy salvation he shall greatly exult.
019	PSA	021	002	Thou hast granted him the desire of his soul, and hast not withheld from him the request of his lips. (Pause)
019	PSA	021	003	For thou hast prevented him with blessings of goodness: thou has set upon his head a crown of precious stone.
019	PSA	021	004	He asked life of thee, and thou gavest him length of days for ever and ever.
019	PSA	021	005	His glory is great in thy salvation: thou wilt crown him with glory and majesty.
019	PSA	021	006	For thou wilt give him a blessing for ever and ever: thou wilt gladden him with joy with thy countenance.
019	PSA	021	007	For the king trusts in the Lord, and through the mercy of the Highest he shall not be moved.
019	PSA	021	008	Let thy hand be found by all thine enemies: let thy right hand find all that hate thee.
019	PSA	021	009	Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven at the time of thy presence: the Lord shall trouble them in his anger, and fire shall devour them.
019	PSA	021	010	Thou shalt destroy their fruit from the earth, and their seed from [among] the sons of men.
019	PSA	021	011	For they intended evils against thee; they imagined a device which they shall by no means be able to perform.
019	PSA	021	012	For thou shalt make them [turn their] back in thy latter end, thou wilt prepare their face.
019	PSA	021	013	Be thou exalted, O Lord, in thy strength: we will sing and praise thy mighty acts.
019	PSA	022	001	For the end, concerning the morning aid, a Psalm of David. O God, my God, attend to me: why hast thou forsaken me? the account of my transgressions is far from my salvation.
019	PSA	022	002	O my God, I will cry to thee by day, but thou wilt not hear: and by night, and [it shall] not [be accounted] for folly to me.
019	PSA	022	003	But thou, the praise of Israel, dwellest in a sanctuary.
019	PSA	022	004	Our fathers hoped in thee; they hoped, and thou didst deliver them.
019	PSA	022	005	They cried to thee, and were saved: they hoped in thee, and were not ashamed.
019	PSA	022	006	But I am a worm, and not a man; a reproach of men, and scorn of the people.
019	PSA	022	007	All that saw me mocked me: they spoke with [their] lips, they shook the head, [saying],
019	PSA	022	008	He hoped in the Lord: let him deliver him, let him save him, because he takes pleasure in him.
019	PSA	022	009	For thou art he that drew me out of the womb; my hope from my mother's breasts.
019	PSA	022	010	I was cast on thee from the womb: thou art my God from my mother's belly.
019	PSA	022	011	Stand not aloof from me; for affliction is near; for there is no helper.
019	PSA	022	012	Many bullocks have compassed me: fat bulls have beset me round.
019	PSA	022	013	They have opened their mouth against me, as a ravening and roaring lion.
019	PSA	022	014	I am poured out like water, and all my bones are loosened: my heart in the midst of my belly is become like melting wax.
019	PSA	022	015	My strength is dried up, like a potsherd; and my tongue is glued to my throat; and thou hast brought me down to the dust of death.
019	PSA	022	016	For many dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked doers has beset me round: they pierced my hands and my feet.
019	PSA	022	017	They counted all my bones; and they observed and looked upon me.
019	PSA	022	018	They parted my garments [among] themselves, and cast lots upon my raiment.
019	PSA	022	019	But thou, O Lord, remove not my help afar off: be ready for mine aid.
019	PSA	022	020	Deliver my soul from the sword; my only-begotten one from the power of the dog.

019	PSA	030	009	What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to destruction? Shall the dust give praise to thee? or shall it declare thy truth?
019	PSA	030	010	The Lord heard, and had compassion upon me; the Lord is become my helper.
019	PSA	030	011	Thou hast turned my mourning into joy for me: thou hast rent off my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness;

019	PSA	031	006	Thou has hated them that idly persist in vanities: but I have hoped in the Lord.
019	PSA	031	007	I will exult and be glad in thy mercy: for thou hast looked upon mine affliction; thou hast saved my soul from distresses.
019	PSA	031	008	And thou hast not shut me up into the hands of the enemy: thou hast set my feet in a wide place.
019	PSA	031	009	Pity me, O Lord, for I am afflicted: my eye is troubled with indignation, my soul and by belly.
019	PSA	031	010	For my life is spent with grief, and my years with groanings: my strength has been weakened through poverty, and my bones are troubled.
019	PSA	031	011	I became a reproach among all mine enemies, but exceedingly so to my neighbours, and a fear to mine acquaintance: they that saw me without fled from me.
019	PSA	031	012	I have been forgotten as a dead man out of mind: I am become as a broken vessel.
019	PSA	031	013	For I heard the slander of many that dwelt round about: when they were gathered together against me, they took counsel to take my life.
019	PSA	031	014	But I hoped in thee, O Lord: I said, Thou art my God.
019	PSA	031	015	My lots are in thy hands: deliver me from the hand of mine enemies,

019	PSA	031	018	Let the deceitful lips become dumb, which speak iniquity against the righteous with pride and scorn.
019	PSA	031	019	How abundant is the multitude of thy goodness, O Lord, which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee! thou hast wrought [it] out for them that hope on thee, in the presence of the sons of men.
019	PSA	031	020	Thou wilt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the vexation of man: thou wilt screen them in a tabernacle from the contradiction of tongues.
019	PSA	031	021	Blessed be the Lord: for he has magnified his mercy in a fortified city.
019	PSA	031	022	But I said in my extreme fear, I am cast out from the sight of thine eyes: therefore thou didst hearken, O Lord, to the voice of my supplication when I cried to thee.
019	PSA	031	023	Love the Lord, all ye his saints: for the Lord seeks for truth, and renders [a reward] to them that deal very proudly.

019	PSA	032	003	Because I kept silence, my bones waxed old, from my crying all the day.
019	PSA	032	004	For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: I became thoroughly miserable while a thorn was fastened in [me]. (Pause)
019	PSA	032	005	I acknowledged my sin, and hid not mine iniquity: I said, I will confess mine iniquity to the Lord against myself; and thou forgavest the ungodliness of my heart. (Pause)
019	PSA	032	006	Therefore shall every holy one pray to thee in a fit time: only in the deluge of many waters they shall not come nigh to him.
019	PSA	032	007	Thou art my refuge from the affliction that encompasses me; my joy, to deliver me from them that have compassed me. (Pause)
019	PSA	032	008	I will instruct thee and guide thee in this way wherein thou shalt go: I will fix mine eyes upon thee.
019	PSA	032	009	Be ye not as horse and mule, which have no understanding; [but thou must] constrain their jaws with bit and curb, lest they should come nigh to thee.
019	PSA	032	010	Many are the scourges of the sinner: but him that hopes in the Lord mercy shall compass about.

019	PSA	033	006	By the word of the Lord the heavens were established; and all the host of them by the breath of his [mouth].
019	PSA	033	007	Who gathers the waters of the sea as [in] a bottle; who lays up the deeps in treasuries.
019	PSA	033	008	Let all the earth fear the Lord; and let all that dwell in the world be moved because of him.
019	PSA	033	009	For he spoke, and they were made; he commanded, and they were created.
019	PSA	033	010	The Lord frustrates the counsels of the nations; he brings to nought also the reasonings of the peoples, and brings to nought the counsels of princes.
019	PSA	033	011	But the counsel of the Lord endures for ever, the thoughts of his heart from generation to generation.
019	PSA	033	012	Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord; the people whom he has chosen for his own inheritance.

019	PSA	035	005	Let them be as dust before the wind, and an angel of the Lord afflicting them.
019	PSA	035	006	Let their way be dark and slippery, and an angel of the Lord persecuting them.

019	PSA	035	014	I behaved agreeably towards them as [if it had been] our neighbour [or] brother: I humbled myself as one mourning and sad of countenance.
019	PSA	035	015	Yet they rejoiced against me, and plagues were plentifully brought against me, and I knew [it] not: they were scattered, but repented not.
019	PSA	035	016	They tempted me, they sneered at me most contemptuously, they gnashed their teeth upon me.
019	PSA	035	017	O Lord, when wilt thou look upon me? Deliver my soul from their mischief, mine only-begotten one from the lions.
019	PSA	035	018	I will give thanks to thee even in a great congregation: in an abundant people I will praise thee.
019	PSA	035	019	Let not them that are mine enemies without a cause rejoice against me; who hate me for nothing, and wink with their eyes.
019	PSA	035	020	For to me they spoke peaceably, but imagined deceits in [their] anger.
019	PSA	035	021	And they opened wide their mouth upon me; they said Aha, aha, our eyes have seen [it].
019	PSA	035	022	Thou hast seen [it], O Lord: keep not silence: O Lord, withdraw not [thyself] from me.
019	PSA	035	023	Awake, O Lord, and attend to my judgment, [even] to my cause, my God and my Lord.
019	PSA	035	024	Judge me, O Lord, according to thy righteousness, O Lord my God; and let them not rejoice against me.
019	PSA	035	025	Let them not say in their hearts, Aha, aha, [it is pleasing] to our soul: neither let them say, We have devoured him.
019	PSA	035	026	Let them be confounded and ashamed together that rejoice at my afflictions: let them be clothed with shame and confusion that speak great swelling words against me.
019	PSA	035	027	Let them that rejoice in my righteousness exult and be glad: and let them say continually, The Lord be magnified, who desire the peace of his servant.
019	PSA	035	028	And my tongue shall meditate on thy righteousness, [and] on thy praise all the day.
019	PSA	036	001	For the end, by David the servant of the Lord. The transgressor, that he may sin, says within himself, [that] there is no fear of God before his eyes.
019	PSA	036	002	For he has dealt craftily before him, to discover his iniquity and hate it.
019	PSA	036	003	The words of his mouth are transgression and deceit: he is not inclined to understand [how] to do good.
019	PSA	036	004	He devises iniquity on his bed; he gives himself to every evil way; and does not abhor evil.
019	PSA	036	005	O Lord, thy mercy is in the heaven; and thy truth [reaches] to the clouds.
019	PSA	036	006	Thy righteousness is as the mountains of God, thy judgments are as a great deep: O Lord, thou wilt preserve men and beasts.
019	PSA	036	007	How hast thou multiplied thy mercy, O God! so the children of men shall trust in the shelter of thy wings.
019	PSA	036	008	They shall be fully satisfied with the fatness of thine house; and thou shalt cause them to drink of the full stream of thy delights.
019	PSA	036	009	For with thee is the fountain of life: in thy light we shall see light.
019	PSA	036	010	Extend thy mercy to them that know thee; and thy righteousness to the upright in heart.
019	PSA	036	011	Let not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the hand of sinners move me.
019	PSA	036	012	There have all the workers of iniquity fallen: they are cast out, and shall not be able to stand.
019	PSA	037	001	[A Psalm] of David. Fret not thyself because of evil-doers, neither be envious of them that do iniquity.
019	PSA	037	002	For they shall soon be withered as the grass, and shall soon fall away as the green herbs.
019	PSA	037	003	Hope in the Lord, and do good; and dwell on the land, and thou shalt be fed with the wealth of it.
019	PSA	037	004	Delight [thyself] in the Lord; and he shall grant thee the requests of thine heart.
019	PSA	037	005	Disclose thy way to the Lord, and hope in him; and he shall bring [it] to pass.
019	PSA	037	006	And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the noon-day.
019	PSA	037	007	Submit thyself to the Lord, and supplicate him: fret not thyself because of him that prospers in his way, at the man that does unlawful deeds.
019	PSA	037	008	ease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself so as to do evil.
019	PSA	037	009	For evil-doers shall be destroyed: but they that wait on the Lord, they shall inherit the land.
019	PSA	037	010	And yet a little while, and the sinner shall not be, and thou shalt seek for his place, and shalt not find [it].
019	PSA	037	011	But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight [themselves] in the abundance of peace.
019	PSA	037	012	The sinner will watch for the righteous, and gnash his teeth upon him.
019	PSA	037	013	But the Lord shall laugh at him: for he foresees that his day will come.
019	PSA	037	014	Sinners have drawn their swords, they have bent their bow, to cast down the poor and needy one, [and] to slay the upright in heart.
019	PSA	037	015	Let their sword enter into their [own] heart, and their bows be broken.
019	PSA	037	016	A little is better to the righteous than abundant wealth of sinners.
019	PSA	037	017	For the arms of sinners shall be broken; but the Lord supports the righteous.
019	PSA	037	018	The Lord knows the ways of the perfect; and their inheritance shall be for ever.
019	PSA	037	019	They shall not be ashamed in an evil time; and in days of famine they shall be satisfied.
019	PSA	037	020	For the sinners shall perish; and the enemies of the Lord at the moment of their being honoured and exalted have utterly vanished like smoke.
019	PSA	037	021	The sinner borrows, and will not pay again: but the righteous has compassion, and gives.
019	PSA	037	022	For they that bless him shall inherit the earth; and they that curse him shall be utterly destroyed.
019	PSA	037	023	The steps of a man are rightly ordered by the Lord: and he will take pleasure in his way.
019	PSA	037	024	When he falls, he shall not be ruined: for the Lord supports his hand.
019	PSA	037	025	I was [once] young, indeed I am now old; yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed seeking bread.
019	PSA	037	026	He is merciful, and lends continually; and his seed shall be blessed.
019	PSA	037	027	Turn aside from evil, and do good; and dwell for ever.
019	PSA	037	028	For the Lord loves judgment, and will not forsake his saints; they shall be preserved for ever: the blameless shall be avenged, but the seed of the ungodly shall be utterly destroyed.
019	PSA	037	029	But the righteous shall inherit the earth, and dwell upon it for ever.
019	PSA	037	030	The mouth of the righteous will meditate wisdom, and his tongue will speak of judgment.
019	PSA	037	031	The law of his God is in his heart; and his steps shall not slide.
019	PSA	037	032	The sinner watches the righteous, and seeks to slay him.
019	PSA	037	033	But the Lord will not leave him in his hands, nor by any means condemn him when he is judged.
019	PSA	037	034	Wait on the Lord, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land: when the wicked are destroyed, thou shalt see [it].
019	PSA	037	035	I saw the ungodly very highly exalting himself, and lifting himself up like the cedars of Libanus.
019	PSA	037	036	Yet I passed by, and lo! he was not: and I sought him, but his place was not found.
019	PSA	037	037	Maintain innocence, and behold uprightness: for there is a remnant to the peaceable man.
019	PSA	037	038	But the transgressors shall be utterly destroyed together: the remnants of the ungodly shall be utterly destroyed.
019	PSA	037	039	But the salvation of the righteous is of the Lord; and he is their defender in the time of affliction.
019	PSA	037	040	And the Lord shall help them, and deliver them: and he shall rescue them from sinners, and save them, because they have hoped in him.
019	PSA	038	001	A Psalm of David for remembrance concerning the Sabbath-day. O Lord, rebuke me not in thy wrath, neither chasten me in thine anger.
019	PSA	038	002	For thy weapons are fixed in me, and thou hast pressed thy hand heavily upon me.
019	PSA	038	003	For there is no health in my flesh because of thine anger; there is no peace to my bones because of my sins.
019	PSA	038	004	For my transgressions have gone over mine head: they have pressed heavily upon me like a weighty burden.
019	PSA	038	005	My bruises have become noisome and corrupt, because of my foolishness.
019	PSA	038	006	I have been wretched and bowed down continually: I went with a mourning countenance all the day.
019	PSA	038	007	For my soul is filled with mockings; and there is no health in my flesh.
019	PSA	038	008	I have been afflicted and brought down exceedingly: I have roared for the groaning of my heart.
019	PSA	038	009	But all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not hidden from thee.
019	PSA	038	010	My heart is troubled, my strength has failed me; and the light of mine eyes is not with me.
019	PSA	038	011	My friends and my neighbours drew near before me, and stood still; and my nearest of kin stood afar off.
019	PSA	038	012	While they pressed hard upon me that sought my soul: and they that sought my hurt spoke vanities, and devised deceits all the day.
019	PSA	038	013	But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and was as a dumb man not opening his mouth.
019	PSA	038	014	And I was as a man that hears not, and who has no reproofs in his mouth.
019	PSA	038	015	For I hoped in thee, O Lord: thou wilt hear, O Lord my God.
019	PSA	038	016	For I said, Lest mine enemies rejoice against me: for when my feet were moved, they spoke boastingly against me.
019	PSA	038	017	For I am ready for plagues, and my grief is continually before me.
019	PSA	038	018	For I will declare mine iniquity, and be distressed for my sin.
019	PSA	038	019	But mine enemies live, and are mightier than I: and they that hate me unjustly are multiplied.
019	PSA	038	020	They that reward evil for good slandered me; because I followed righteousness.
019	PSA	038	021	Forsake me not, O Lord my God: depart not from me.
019	PSA	038	022	Draw nigh to my help, O Lord of my salvation.
019	PSA	039	001	For the end, a Song of David, to Idithun. I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue: I set a guard on my mouth, while the sinner stood in my presence.
019	PSA	039	002	I was dumb, and humbled myself, and kept silence from good [words]; and my grief was renewed.
019	PSA	039	003	My heart grew hot within me, and a fire would kindle in my (meditation) I spoke with my tongue,
019	PSA	039	004	O Lord, make me to know mine end, and the number of my days, what it is; that I may know what I lack.
019	PSA	039	005	Behold, thou hast made my days old; and my existence [is] as nothing before thee: nay, every man living [is] altogether vanity. (Pause)
019	PSA	039	006	Surely man walks in a shadow; nay, he is disquieted in vain: he lays up treasures, and knows not for whom he shall gather them.
019	PSA	039	007	And now what [is] my expectation? [is it] not the Lord? and my ground [of hope] is with thee. (Pause)
019	PSA	039	008	Deliver me from all my transgressions: thou hast made me a reproach to the foolish.
019	PSA	039	009	I was dumb, and opened not my mouth; for thou art he that made me.
019	PSA	039	010	Remove thy scourges from me: I have fainted by reason of the strength of thine hand.
019	PSA	039	011	Thou chastenest man with rebukes for iniquity, and thou makest his life to consume away like a spider's web; nay, every man is disquieted in vain. (Pause)
019	PSA	039	012	O Lord, hearken to my prayer and my supplication: attend to my tears: be not silent, for I am a sojourner in the land, and a stranger, as all my fathers [were].
019	PSA	039	013	Spare me, that I may be refreshed, before I depart, and be no more.
019	PSA	040	001	For the end, a Psalm of David. I waited patiently for the Lord; and he attended to me, and hearkened to my supplication.
019	PSA	040	002	And he brought me up out of a pit of misery, and from miry clay: and he set my feet on a rock, and ordered my goings aright.
019	PSA	040	003	And he put a new song into my mouth, [even] a hymn to our God: many shall see [it], and fear, and shall hope in the Lord.
019	PSA	040	004	Blessed [is] the man whose hope is in the name of the Lord, and [who] has not regarded vanities and false frenzies.
019	PSA	040	005	O Lord my God, thou hast multiplied thy wonderful works, and in thy thoughts there is none who shall be likened to thee: I declared and spoke [of them]: they exceeded number.
019	PSA	040	006	Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not; but a body hast thou prepared me: whole-burnt-offering and [sacrifice] for sin thou didst not require.
019	PSA	040	007	Then I said, Behold, I come: in the volume of the book it is written concerning me,
019	PSA	040	008	I desired to do thy will, O my God, and thy law in the midst of mine heart.
019	PSA	040	009	I have preached righteousness in the great congregation; lo! I will not refrain my lips; O Lord, thou knowest my righteousness.
019	PSA	040	010	I have not hid thy truth within my heart, and I have declared thy salvation; I have not hid thy mercy and thy truth from the great congregation.
019	PSA	040	011	But thou, Lord, remove not thy compassion far from me; thy mercy and thy truth have helped me continually.
019	PSA	040	012	For innumerable evils have encompassed me; my transgressions have taken hold of me, and I could not see; they are multiplied more than the hairs of my head; and my heart has failed me.
019	PSA	040	013	Be pleased, O Lord, to deliver me; O Lord, draw nigh to help me.
019	PSA	040	014	Let those that seek my soul, to destroy it, be ashamed and confounded together; let those that wish me evil be turned backward and put to shame.
019	PSA	040	015	Let those that say to me, Aha, aha, quickly receive shame for their reward.
019	PSA	040	016	Let all those that seek thee, O Lord, exult and rejoice in thee; and let them that love thy salvation say continually, The Lord be magnified.
019	PSA	040	017	But I am poor and needy; the Lord will take care of me; thou art my helper, and my defender, O my God, delay not.
019	PSA	041	001	For the end, a Psalm of David. Blessed [is the man] who thinks, on the poor and needy: the Lord shall deliver him in an evil day.
019	PSA	041	002	May the Lord preserve him and keep him alive, and bless him on the earth, and not deliver him into the hands of his enemy.
019	PSA	041	003	May the Lord help him upon the bed of his pain; thou hast made all his bed in his sickness.
019	PSA	041	004	I said, O Lord, have mercy upon me; heal my soul; for I have sinned against thee.
019	PSA	041	005	Mine enemies have spoken evil against me, [saying], When shall he die, and his name perish?
019	PSA	041	006	And if he came to see [me], his heart spoke vainly; he gathered iniquity to himself; he went forth and spoke in like manner.
019	PSA	041	007	All my enemies whispered against me; against me they devised my hurt.
019	PSA	041	008	They denounced a wicked word against me, [saying], Now that he lies, shall he not rise up again?
019	PSA	041	009	For even the man of my peace, in whom I trusted, who ate my bread, lifted up [his] heel against me.
019	PSA	041	010	But thou, O Lord, have compassion upon me, and raise me up, and I shall requite them.
019	PSA	041	011	By this I know that thou hast delighted in me, because mine enemy shall not rejoice over me.
019	PSA	041	012	But thou didst help me because of [mine] innocence, and hast established me before thee for ever.
019	PSA	041	013	Blessed [be] the Lord God of Israel from everlasting, and to everlasting. So be it, so be it.
019	PSA	042	001	For the end, [a Psalm] for instruction, for the sons of Core. As the hart earnestly desires the fountains of water, so my soul earnestly longs for thee, O God.
019	PSA	042	002	My soul has thirsted for the living God: when shall I come and appear before God?
019	PSA	042	003	My tears have been bread to me day and night, while they daily said to me, Where is thy God?
019	PSA	042	004	I remembered these things, and poured out my soul in me, for I will go to the place of thy wondrous tabernacle, [even] to the house of God, with a voice of exultation and thanksgiving and of the sound of those who keep festival.
019	PSA	042	005	Wherefore art thou very sad, O my soul? and wherefore dost thou trouble me? hope in God; for I will give thanks to him; [he is] the salvation of my countenance.
019	PSA	042	006	O my God, my soul has been troubled within me: therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan, and of the Ermonites, from the little hill.
019	PSA	042	007	Deep calls to deep at the voice of thy cataracts: all thy billows and thy waves have gone over me.
019	PSA	042	008	By day the Lord will command his mercy, and manifest [it] by night: with me [is] prayer to the God of my life.
019	PSA	042	009	I will say to God, Thou art my helper; why hast thou forgotten me? wherefore do I go sad of countenance, while the enemy oppresses [me]?
019	PSA	042	010	While my bones were breaking, they that afflicted me reproached me; while they said to me daily, Where is thy God?
019	PSA	042	011	Wherefore art thou very sad, O my soul? and wherefore dost thou trouble me? hope in God; for I will give thanks to him; [he is] the health of my countenance, and my God.
019	PSA	043	001	A Psalm of David. Judge me, O God, and plead my cause, against an ungodly nation: deliver me from the unjust and crafty man.
019	PSA	043	002	For thou, O God, art my strength: wherefore hast thou cast me off? and why do I go sad of countenance, while the enemy oppresses [me]?
019	PSA	043	003	Send forth thy light and thy truth: they have led me, and brought me to thy holy mountain, and to thy tabernacles.
019	PSA	043	004	And I will go in to the altar of God, to God who gladdens my youth: I will give thanks to thee on the harp, O God, my God.
019	PSA	043	005	Wherefore art thou very sad, O my soul? and wherefore dost thou trouble me? Hope in God; for I will give thanks to him, [who is] the health of my countenance, [and] my God.
019	PSA	044	001	For the end, a Psalm for instruction, for the sons of Core. O God, we have heard with our ears, our fathers have told us, the work which thou wroughtest in their days, in the days of old.
019	PSA	044	002	Thine hand utterly destroyed the heathen, and thou didst plant them: thou didst afflict the nations, and cast them out.
019	PSA	044	003	For they inherited not the land by their [own] sword, and their [own] arm did not deliver them; but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou wert well pleased in them.
019	PSA	044	004	Thou art indeed my King and my God, who commandest deliverances for Jacob.
019	PSA	044	005	In thee will we push down our enemies, and in thy name will we bring to nought them that rise up against us.
019	PSA	044	006	For I will not trust in my bow, and my sword shall not save me.
019	PSA	044	007	For thou hast saved us from them that afflicted us, and hast put to shame them that hated us.
019	PSA	044	008	In God will we make our boast all the day, and to thy name will we give thanks for ever. (Pause)
019	PSA	044	009	But now thou hast cast off, and put us to shame; and thou wilt not go forth with our hosts.
019	PSA	044	010	Thou hast turned us back before our enemies; and they that hated us spoiled for themselves.
019	PSA	044	011	Thou madest us as sheep for meat; and thou scatteredst us among the nations.
019	PSA	044	012	Thou hast sold thy people without price, and there was no profit by their exchange.
019	PSA	044	013	Thou hast made us a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and derision them that are round about us.
019	PSA	044	014	Thou hast made us a proverb among the Gentiles, a shaking of the head among the nations.
019	PSA	044	015	All the day my shame is before me, and the confusion of my face has covered me,
019	PSA	044	016	because of the voice of the slanderer and reviler; because of the enemy and avenger.
019	PSA	044	017	All these things are come upon us: but we have not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt unrighteously in thy covenant.
019	PSA	044	018	And our heart has not gone back; but thou hast turned aside our paths from thy way.
019	PSA	044	019	For thou hast laid us low in a place of affliction, and the shadow of death has covered us.
019	PSA	044	020	If we have forgotten the name of our God, and if we have spread out our hands to a strange god; shall not God search these things out?
019	PSA	044	021	for he knows the secrets of the heart.
019	PSA	044	022	For, for thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are counted as sheep for slaughter.
019	PSA	044	023	Awake, wherefore sleepest thou, O Lord? arise, and do not cast [us] off for ever.
019	PSA	044	024	Wherefore turnest thou thy face away, [and] forgettest our poverty and our affliction?
019	PSA	044	025	For our soul has been brought down to the dust; our belly has cleaved to the earth.
019	PSA	044	026	Arise, O Lord, help us, and redeem us for thy name's sake.
019	PSA	045	001	For the end, for alternate [strains] by the sons of Core; for instruction, a Song concerning the beloved. My heart has uttered a good matter: I declare my works to the king: my tongue is the pen of a quick writer.
019	PSA	045	002	Thou art more beautiful than the sons of men: grace has been shed forth on thy lips: therefore God has blessed thee for ever.
019	PSA	045	003	Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O Mighty One, in thy comeliness, and in thy beauty;
019	PSA	045	004	and bend [thy bow], and prosper, and reign, because of truth and meekness and righteousness; and thy right hand shall guide thee wonderfully.
019	PSA	045	005	Thy weapons are sharpened, Mighty One, (the nations shall fall under thee) [they are] in the heart of the king's enemies.
019	PSA	045	006	Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom is a sceptre of righteousness.
019	PSA	045	007	Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity: therefore God, thy God, has anointed thee with the oil of gladness beyond thy fellows.
019	PSA	045	008	Myrrh, and stacte, and cassia [are exhaled] from thy garments, [and] out of the ivory palaces,
019	PSA	045	009	with which kings' daughters have gladdened thee for thine honour: the queen stood by on thy right hand, clothed in vesture wrought with gold, [and] arrayed in divers colours.
019	PSA	045	010	Hear, O daughter, and see, and incline thine ear; forget also thy people, and thy father's house.
019	PSA	045	011	Because the king has desired thy beauty; for he is thy Lord.
019	PSA	045	012	And the daughter of Tyre shall adore him with gifts; the rich of the people of the land shall supplicate thy favour.
019	PSA	045	013	All her glory [is that] of the daughter of the king of Esebon, robed [as she is] in golden fringed garments,
019	PSA	045	014	in embroidered [clothing]: virgins shall be brought to the king after her: her fellows shall be brought to thee.
019	PSA	045	015	They shall be brought with gladness and exultation: they shall be led into the king's temple.
019	PSA	045	016	Instead of thy fathers children are born to thee: thou shalt make them princes over all the earth.
019	PSA	045	017	They shall make mention of thy name from generation to generation: therefore shall the nations give thanks to thee for ever, even for ever and ever.
019	PSA	046	001	For the end, for the sons of Core; a Psalm concerning secret things. God is our refuge and strength, a help in the afflictions that have come heavily upon us.
019	PSA	046	002	Therefore will we not fear when the earth is troubled, and the mountains are removed into the depths of the seas.
019	PSA	046	003	Their waters have roared and been troubled, the mountains have been troubled by his might. (Pause)
019	PSA	046	004	The flowings of the river gladden the city of God: the Most High has sanctified his tabernacle.
019	PSA	046	005	God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall help her with his countenance.
019	PSA	046	006	The nations were troubled, the kingdoms tottered: he uttered his voice, the earth shook.
019	PSA	046	007	The Lord of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our helper. (Pause)
019	PSA	046	008	Come, and behold the works of the Lord, what wonders he has achieved on the earth.
019	PSA	046	009	Putting an end to wars as for the ends of the earth; he will crush the bow, and break in pieces the weapon, and burn the bucklers with fire.
019	PSA	046	010	Be still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth.
019	PSA	046	011	The Lord of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our helper.
019	PSA	047	001	For the end, a Psalm for the sons of Core. Clap your hands, all ye nations; shout to God with a voice of exultation.
019	PSA	047	002	For the Lord most high is terrible; [he is] a great king over all the earth.
019	PSA	047	003	He has subdued the peoples under us, and the nations under our feet.
019	PSA	047	004	He has chosen out his inheritance for us, the beauty of Jacob which he loved. (Pause)
019	PSA	047	005	God is gone up with a shout, the Lord with a sound of a trumpet.
019	PSA	047	006	Sing praises to our God, sing praises: sing praises to our King, sing praises.
019	PSA	047	007	For God is king of all the earth: sing praises with understanding.
019	PSA	047	008	God reigns over the nations: God sits upon the throne of his holiness.
019	PSA	047	009	The rulers of the people are assembled with the God of Abraam: for God's mighty ones of the earth have been greatly exalted.
019	PSA	048	001	A Psalm of praise for the sons of Core on the second [day] of the week. Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised in the city of our God, in his holy mountain.
019	PSA	048	002	The city of the great King is well planted [on] the mountains of Sion, with the joy of the whole earth, [on] the sides of the north.
019	PSA	048	003	God is known in her palaces, when he undertakes to help her.
019	PSA	048	004	For, behold the kings of the earth were assembled, they came together.
019	PSA	048	005	They saw, and so they wondered: they were troubled, they were moved.
019	PSA	048	006	Trembling took hold on them: there were the pangs as of a woman in travail.
019	PSA	048	007	Thou wilt break the ships of Tharsis with a vehement wind.
019	PSA	048	008	As we have heard, so have we also seen, in the city of the Lord of hosts, in the city of our God: God has founded it for ever. (Pause)
019	PSA	048	009	We have thought of thy mercy, O God, in the midst of thy people.
019	PSA	048	010	According to thy name, O God, so is also thy praise to the ends of the earth: thy right hand is full of righteousness.
019	PSA	048	011	Let mount Sion rejoice, let the daughters of Judaea exult, because of thy judgments, O Lord.
019	PSA	048	012	Go round about Sion, and encompass her: tell ye her towers.
019	PSA	048	013	Mark ye well her strength, and observe her palaces; that ye may tell the next generation.
019	PSA	048	014	For this is our God for ever and ever: he will be our guide for evermore.
019	PSA	049	001	For the end, a Psalm for the sons of Core. Hear these words, all ye nations, hearken, all ye that dwell upon the earth:
019	PSA	049	002	both the sons of mean men, and sons of [great] men; the rich and poor [man] together.
019	PSA	049	003	My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart shall bring [forth] understanding.
019	PSA	049	004	I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my riddle on the harp.
019	PSA	049	005	Wherefore should I fear in the evil day? the iniquity of my heel shall compass me.
019	PSA	049	006	They that trust in their strength, and boast themselves in the multitude of their wealth—
019	PSA	049	007	A brother does not redeem, shall a man redeem? he shall not give to God a ransom for himself,
019	PSA	049	008	or the price of the redemption of his soul, though he labour for ever,
019	PSA	049	009	and live to the end, [so] that he should not see corruption.
019	PSA	049	010	When he shall see wise men dying, the fool and the senseless one shall perish together; and they shall leave their wealth to strangers.
019	PSA	049	011	And their sepulchres are their houses for ever, [even] their tabernacles to all generations: they have called their lands after their own names.
019	PSA	049	012	And man being in honour, understands not: he is compared to the senseless cattle, and is like to them.
019	PSA	049	013	This their way is an offence to them: yet afterwards men will commend their sayings. (Pause)
019	PSA	049	014	They have laid [them] as sheep in Hades; death shall feed on them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning, and their help shall fail in Hades from their glory.
019	PSA	049	015	But God shall deliver my soul from the power of Hades, when he shall receive me. (Pause)
019	PSA	049	016	Fear not when a man is enriched, and when the glory of his house is increased.
019	PSA	049	017	For he shall take nothing when he dies; neither shall his glory descend with him.
019	PSA	049	018	For his soul shall be blessed in his life: he shall give thanks to thee when thou dost well to him.
019	PSA	049	019	[Yet] he shall go in to the generation of his fathers; he shall never see light.
019	PSA	049	020	Man that is in honour, understands not: he is compared to the senseless cattle, and is like them.
019	PSA	050	001	A Psalm for Asaph. The God of gods, the Lord, has spoken, and called the earth from the rising of the sun to the going down [thereof].
019	PSA	050	002	Out of Sion [comes] the excellence of his beauty.
019	PSA	050	003	God, our God, shall come manifestly, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall be kindled before him, and round about him there shall be a very great tempest.
019	PSA	050	004	He shall summon the heaven above, and the earth, that he may judge his people.
019	PSA	050	005	Assemble ye his saints to him, those that have engaged in a covenant with him upon sacrifices.
019	PSA	050	006	And the heavens shall declare his righteousness: for God is judge. (Pause)
019	PSA	050	007	Hear, my people, and I will speak to thee, O Israel: and I will testify to thee: I am God, thy God.
019	PSA	050	008	I will not reprove thee on account of thy sacrifices; for thy whole-burnt-offerings are before me continually.
019	PSA	050	009	I will take no bullocks out of thine house, nor he-goats out of thy flocks.
019	PSA	050	010	For all the wild beasts of the thicket are mine, the cattle on the mountains, and oxen.
019	PSA	050	011	I know all the birds of the sky; and the beauty of the field is mine.
019	PSA	050	012	If I should be hungry, I will not tell thee: for the world is mine, and the fullness of it.
019	PSA	050	013	Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?
019	PSA	050	014	Offer to God the sacrifice of praise; and pay thy vows to the Most High.
019	PSA	050	015	And call upon me in the day of affliction; and I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me. (Pause)
019	PSA	050	016	But to the sinner God has said, Why dost thou declare my ordinances, and take up my covenant in thy mouth?
019	PSA	050	017	Whereas thou hast hated instruction, and hast cast my words behind [thee].
019	PSA	050	018	If thou sawest a thief, thou rannest along with him, and hast cast in thy lot with adulterers.
019	PSA	050	019	Thy mouth has multiplied wickedness, and thy tongue has framed deceit.
019	PSA	050	020	Thou didst sit and speak against thy brother, and didst scandalize thy mother's son.
019	PSA	050	021	These things thou didst, and I kept silence: thou thoughtest wickedly that I should be like thee, [but] I will reprove thee, and set [thine offences] before thee.
019	PSA	050	022	Now consider these things, ye that forget God, lest he rend [you], and there is no deliverer.
019	PSA	050	023	The sacrifice of praise will glorify me: and that is the way wherein I will shew to him the salvation of God.
019	PSA	051	001	For the end, a Psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet came to him, when he had gone to Bersabee. Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy great mercy; and according to the multitude of thy compassions blot out my transgression.
019	PSA	051	002	Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.
019	PSA	051	003	For I am conscious of mine iniquity; and my sin is continually before me.
019	PSA	051	004	Against thee only have I sinned, and done evil before thee: that thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.
019	PSA	051	005	For, behold, I was conceived in iniquities, and in sins did my mother conceive me.
019	PSA	051	006	For, behold, thou lovest truth: thou hast manifested to me the secret and hidden things of thy wisdom.
019	PSA	051	007	Thou shalt sprinkle me with hyssop, and I shall be purified: thou shalt wash me, and I shall be made whiter than snow.
019	PSA	051	008	Thou shalt cause me to hear gladness and joy: the afflicted bones shall rejoice.
019	PSA	051	009	Turn away thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities.
019	PSA	051	010	Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit in my inward parts.
019	PSA	051	011	Cast me not away from thy presence; and remove not thy holy Spirit from me.
019	PSA	051	012	Restore to me the joy of thy salvation: establish me with thy directing Spirit.
019	PSA	051	013	[Then] will I teach transgressors thy ways; and ungodly men shall turn to thee.
019	PSA	051	014	Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, O God, the God of my salvation: [and] my tongue shall joyfully declare thy righteousness.
019	PSA	051	015	O Lord, thou shalt open my lips; and my mouth shall declare thy praise.
019	PSA	051	016	For if thou desiredst sacrifice, I would have given [it]: thou wilt not take pleasure in whole-burnt-offerings.
019	PSA	051	017	Sacrifice to God is a broken spirit: a broken and humbled heart God will not despise.
019	PSA	051	018	Do good, O Lord, to Sion in thy good pleasure; and let the walls of Jerusalem be built.
019	PSA	051	019	Then shalt thou be pleased with a sacrifice of righteousness, offering, and whole-burnt-sacrifices: then shall they offer calves upon thine altar.
019	PSA	052	001	For the end, [a Psalm] of instruction by David, when Doec the Idumean came and told Saul, and said to him, David is gone to the house of Abimelech. Why dost thou, O mighty man, boast of iniquity in [thy] mischief? All the day
019	PSA	052	002	thy tongue has devised unrighteousness; like a sharpened razor thou hast wrought deceit.
019	PSA	052	003	Thou hast loved wickedness more than goodness; unrighteousness better than to speak righteousness. (Pause)
019	PSA	052	004	Thou has loved all words of destruction, [and] a deceitful tongue.
019	PSA	052	005	Therefore may God destroy thee for ever, may he pluck thee up and utterly remove thee from [thy] dwelling, and thy root from the land of the living. (Pause)
019	PSA	052	006	And the righteous shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at him, and say,
019	PSA	052	007	Behold the man who made not God his help; but trusted in the abundance of his wealth, and strengthened himself in his vanity.
019	PSA	052	008	But I am as a fruitful olive in the house of God: I have trusted in the mercy of God for ever, even for evermore.
019	PSA	052	009	I will give thanks to thee for ever, for thou hast done [it]: and I will wait on thy name; for [it is] good before the saints.
019	PSA	053	001	For the end, [a Psalm] of David upon Maeleth, of instruction. The fool has said in his heart, There is no God. They have corrupted [themselves], and become abominable in iniquities: there is none that does good.
019	PSA	053	002	God looked down from heaven upon the sons of men, to see if there were any that understood, or sought after God.
019	PSA	053	003	They have all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that does good, there is not even one.
019	PSA	053	004	Will none of the workers of iniquity know, who devour my people as they would eat bread? they have not called upon God. There were they greatly afraid, where there was no fear:
019	PSA	053	005	or God has scattered the bones of the men-pleasers; they were ashamed, for God despised them.
019	PSA	053	006	Who will bring the salvation of Israel out of Sion? When the Lord turns the captivity of his people, Jacob shall exult, and Israel shall be glad.
019	PSA	054	001	For the end, among Hymns of instruction by David, when the Ziphites came and said to Saul, Lo, is not David hid with us? Save me, O God, by thy name, and judge me by thy might.
019	PSA	054	002	O God, hear my prayer; hearken to the words of my mouth.
019	PSA	054	003	For strangers have risen up against me, and mighty men have sought my life: they have not set God before them. (Pause)
019	PSA	054	004	For lo! God assists me; and the Lord is the helper of my soul.
019	PSA	054	005	He shall return evil to mine enemies; utterly destroy them in thy truth.
019	PSA	054	006	I will willingly sacrifice to thee: I will give thanks to thy name, O Lord; for [it is] good.
019	PSA	054	007	For thou hast delivered me out of all affliction, and mine eye has seen [my desire] upon mine enemies.
019	PSA	055	001	For the end, among Hymns of instruction by David. Hearken, O God, to my prayer; and disregard not my supplication.
019	PSA	055	002	Attend to me, and hearken to me: I was grieved in my (meditation) and troubled;
019	PSA	055	003	because of the voice of the enemy, and because of the oppression of the sinner: for they brought iniquity against me, and were wrathfully angry with me.
019	PSA	055	004	My heart was troubled within me; and the fear of death fell upon me.
019	PSA	055	005	Fear and trembling came upon me, and darkness covered me.
019	PSA	055	006	And I said, O that I had wings as [those] of a dove! then would I flee away, and be at rest.
019	PSA	055	007	Lo! I have fled afar off, and lodged in the wilderness. (Pause)
019	PSA	055	008	I waited for him that should deliver me from distress of spirit and tempest.
019	PSA	055	009	Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongues: for I have seen iniquity and gain saying in the city.
019	PSA	055	010	Day and night he shall go round about it upon its walls: iniquity and sorrow and unrighteousness [are] in the midst of it;
019	PSA	055	011	and usury and craft have not failed from its streets.
019	PSA	055	012	For if an enemy had reproached me, I would have endured it; and if one who hated [me] had spoken vauntingly against me, I would have hid myself from him.
019	PSA	055	013	But thou, O man like minded, my guide, and my acquaintance,
019	PSA	055	014	who in companionship with me sweetened [our] food: we walked in the house of God in concord.
019	PSA	055	015	Let death come upon them, and let them go down alive into Hades, for iniquity is in their dwellings, in the midst of them.
019	PSA	055	016	I cried to God, and the Lord hearkened to me.
019	PSA	055	017	Evening, and morning, and at noon I will declare and make known [my wants]: and he shall hear my voice.
019	PSA	055	018	He shall deliver my soul in peace from them that draw nigh to me: for they were with me in many [cases].
019	PSA	055	019	God shall hear, and bring them low, [even] he that has existed from eternity. (Pause) For they suffer no reverse, and [therefore] they have not feared God.
019	PSA	055	020	He has reached forth his hand for retribution; they have profaned his covenant.
019	PSA	055	021	They were scattered at the anger of his countenance, and his heart drew nigh them. His words were smoother than oil, yet are they darts.
019	PSA	055	022	Cast thy care upon the Lord, and he shall sustain thee; he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved.
019	PSA	055	023	But thou, O God, shalt bring them down to the pit of destruction; bloody and crafty men shall not live out half their days; but I will hope in thee, O Lord.
019	PSA	056	001	For the end, concerning the people that were removed from the sanctuary, by David for a memorial, when the Philistines caught him in Geth. Have mercy upon me, O God; for man has trodden me down; all the day long he warring has afflicted me.
019	PSA	056	002	Mine enemies have trodden me down all the day from the dawning of the day; for there are many warring against me.
019	PSA	056	003	They shall be afraid, but I will trust in thee.
019	PSA	056	004	In God I will praise my words; all the day have I hoped in God; I will not fear what flesh shall do to me.
019	PSA	056	005	All the day long they have abominated my words; all their devices [are] against me for evil.
019	PSA	056	006	They will dwell near and hide [themselves]; they will watch my steps, accordingly as I have waited patiently in my soul.
019	PSA	056	007	Thou wilt on no account save them; thou wilt bring down the people in wrath.
019	PSA	056	008	O God, I have declared my life to thee; thou has set my tears before thee, even according to thy promise.
019	PSA	056	009	Mine enemies shall be turned back, in the day wherein I shall call upon thee; behold, I know that thou art my God.
019	PSA	056	010	In God, will I praise [his] word; in the Lord will I praise [his] saying.
019	PSA	056	011	I have hoped in God; I will not be afraid of what man shall do to me.
019	PSA	056	012	The vows of thy praise, O God, which I will pay, are upon me.
019	PSA	056	013	For thou hast delivered my soul from death, and my feet from sliding, that I should be well-pleasing before God in the land of the living.
019	PSA	057	001	For the end. Destroy not: by David, for a memorial, when he fled from the presence of Saul to the cave. Have mercy, upon me, O God, have mercy upon me: for my soul has trusted in thee: and in the shadow of thy wings will I hope, until the iniquity have passed away.
019	PSA	057	002	I will cry to God most high; the God who has benefited me. (Pause)
019	PSA	057	003	He sent from heaven and saved me; he gave to reproach them that trampled on me: God has sent forth his mercy and his truth;
019	PSA	057	004	and he has delivered my soul from the midst of [lions']whelps: I lay down to sleep, [though] troubled. [As for] the sons of men, their teeth are arms and [missile] weapons, and their tongue a sharp sword.
019	PSA	057	005	Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; and thy glory above all the earth.
019	PSA	057	006	They have prepared snares for my feet, and have bowed down my soul: they have dug a pit before my face, and fallen into it [themselves]. (Pause)
019	PSA	057	007	My heart, O God, [is] ready, my heart [is] ready: I will sing, yea will sing psalms.
019	PSA	057	008	Awake, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp: I will awake early.
019	PSA	057	009	O Lord, I will give thanks to thee among the nations: I will sing to thee among the Gentiles.
019	PSA	057	010	For thy mercy has been magnified even to the heavens, and thy truth to the clouds.
019	PSA	057	011	Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; and thy glory above all the earth.
019	PSA	058	001	For the end. Destroy not: by David, for a memorial. If ye do indeed speak righteousness, [then] do ye judge rightly, ye sons of men.
019	PSA	058	002	For ye work iniquities in [your] hearts in the earth: your hands plot unrighteousness.
019	PSA	058	003	Sinners have gone astray from the womb: they go astray from the belly: they speak lies.
019	PSA	058	004	Their venom is like [that] of a serpent; as [that] of a deaf asp, and that stops her ears;
019	PSA	058	005	which will not hear the voice of charmers, nor [heed] the charm prepared skillfully by the wise.
019	PSA	058	006	God has crushed their teeth in their mouth: God has broken the cheek-teeth of the lions.
019	PSA	058	007	They shall utterly pass away like water running through: he shall bend his bow till they shall fail.
019	PSA	058	008	They shall be destroyed as melted wax: the fire has fallen and they have not seen the sun.
019	PSA	058	009	Before your thorns feel the white thorn, he shall swallow you up as living, as in his wrath.
019	PSA	058	010	The righteous shall rejoice when he sees the vengeance of the ungodly: he shall wash his hands in the blood of the sinner.
019	PSA	058	011	And a man shall say, Verily then there is a reward for the righteous: verily there is a God that judges them in the earth.
019	PSA	059	001	For the end. Destroy not: by David for a memorial, when Saul sent, and watched his house to kill him. Deliver me from mine enemies, O God; and ransom me from those that rise up against me.
019	PSA	059	002	Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from bloody men.
019	PSA	059	003	For, behold, they have hunted after my soul; violent men have set upon me: neither [is it] my iniquity, nor my sin, O Lord.
019	PSA	059	004	Without iniquity I ran and directed [my course aright]: awake to help me, and behold.
019	PSA	059	005	And thou, Lord God of hosts, the God of Israel, draw nigh to visit all the heathen; pity not any that work iniquity. (Pause)
019	PSA	059	006	They shall return at evening, and hunger like a dog, and go round about the city.
019	PSA	059	007	Behold, they shall utter a voice with their mouth, and a sword is in their lips; for who, [say they], has heard?
019	PSA	059	008	But thou, Lord, wilt laugh them to scorn; thou wilt utterly set at nought all the heathen.
019	PSA	059	009	will keep my strength, [looking] to thee; for thou, O God, art my helper.
019	PSA	059	010	[As for] my God, his mercy shall go before me: my God will shew me [vengeance] on mine enemies.
019	PSA	059	011	Slay them not, lest they forget thy law; scatter them by thy power; and bring them down, O Lord, my defender.
019	PSA	059	012	[For] the sin of their mouth, [and] the word of their lips, let them be even taken in their pride.
019	PSA	059	013	And for [their] cursing and falsehood shall utter destruction be denounced: [they shall fall] by the wrath of utter destruction, and shall not be; so shall they know that the God of Jacob is Lord of the ends of the earth. (Pause)
019	PSA	059	014	They shall return at evening, and be hungry as a dog, and go round about the city.
019	PSA	059	015	They shall be scattered hither and thither for meat; and if they be not satisfied, they shall even murmur.
019	PSA	059	016	But I will sing to thy strength, and in the morning will I exult [in] thy mercy; for thou hast been my supporter, and my refuge in the day of mine affliction.
019	PSA	059	017	[Thou art] my helper; to thee, my God, will I sing; thou art my supporter, O my God, [and] my mercy.
019	PSA	060	001	For the end, for them that shall yet be changed; for an inscription by David for instruction, when he [had] burned Mesopotamia of Syria, and Syria Sobal, and Joab [had] returned and smitten [in] the valley of salt twelve thousand. O God, thou hast rejected and destroyed us; thou hast been angry, yet hast pitied us.
019	PSA	060	002	Thou hast shaken the earth, and troubled it; heal its breaches, for it has been shaken.
019	PSA	060	003	Thou hast shewn thy people hard things: thou has made us drink the wine of astonishment.
019	PSA	060	004	Thou hast given a token to them that fear thee, that they might flee from the bow. (Pause)
019	PSA	060	005	That thy beloved ones may be delivered; save with thy right hand, and hear me.

019	PSA	060	007	Galaad is mine, and Manasse is mine; and Ephraim is the strength of my head;

019	PSA	060	009	Who will lead me into the fortified city? who will guide me as far a Idumea?
019	PSA	060	010	Wilt not thou, O God, who hast cast us off? and wilt not thou, O God, go forth with our forces?

019	PSA	061	003	because thou wert my hope, a tower of strength from the face of the enemy.
019	PSA	061	004	I will dwell in thy tabernacle for ever; I will shelter myself under the shadow of thy wings. (Pause)

019	PSA	062	003	How long will ye assault a man? ye are all slaughtering as with a bowed wall and a broken hedge.
019	PSA	062	004	They only took counsel to set at nought mine honour: I ran in thirst: with their mouth they blessed, but with their heart they cursed. (Pause)
019	PSA	062	005	Nevertheless do thou, my soul, be subjected to God; for of him [is] my patient hope.
019	PSA	062	006	For he [is] my God and my Saviour; my helper, I shall not be moved.

019	PSA	062	011	God has spoken once, [and] I have heard these two things, that power is of God;
019	PSA	062	012	and mercy is thine, O Lord; for thou wilt recompense every one according to his works.
019	PSA	063	001	A Psalm of David, when he was in the wilderness of Idumea. O God, my God, I cry to thee early; my soul has thirsted for thee: how often has my flesh [longed] after thee, in a barren and trackless and dry land!
019	PSA	063	002	Thus have I appeared before thee in the sanctuary, that I might see thy power and thy glory.
019	PSA	063	003	For thy mercy is better than life: my lips shall praise thee.

019	PSA	063	006	Forasmuch as I have remembered thee on my bed: in the early seasons I have meditated on thee.
019	PSA	063	007	For thou hast been my helper, and in the shelter of thy wings will I rejoice.
019	PSA	063	008	My soul has kept very close behind thee: thy right hand has upheld me.
019	PSA	063	009	But they vainly sought after my soul; they shall go into the lowest parts o the earth.

019	PSA	064	002	Thou hast sheltered me from the conspiracy of them that do wickedly; from the multitude of them that work iniquity;
019	PSA	064	003	who have sharpened their tongues as a sword; they have bent their bow maliciously;
019	PSA	064	004	to shoot in secret at the blameless; they will shoot him suddenly, and will not fear.
019	PSA	064	005	They have set up for themselves an evil matter, they have given counsel to hide snares; they have said, Who shall see them?
019	PSA	064	006	They have searched out iniquity; they have wearied themselves with searching diligently, a man shall approach and the heart is deep,
019	PSA	064	007	and God shall be exalted, their wounds were [caused by] the weapon of the foolish children,
019	PSA	064	008	and their tongues have set him at nought, all that saw them were troubled;

019	PSA	065	007	who troublest the depth of the sea, the sounds of its waves.
019	PSA	065	008	The nations shall be troubled, and they that inhabit the ends [of the earth] shall be afraid of thy signs; thou wilt cause the outgoings of morning and evening to rejoice.
019	PSA	065	009	Thou hast visited the earth, and saturated it; thou hast abundantly enriched it. The river of God is filled with water; thou hast prepared their food, for thus is the preparation [of it].

019	PSA	066	007	who by his power is Lord over the age, his eyes look upon the nations; let not them that provoke [him] be exalted in themselves. (Pause)
019	PSA	066	008	Bless our God, ye Gentiles, and make the voice of his praise to be heard;
019	PSA	066	009	who quickens my soul in life, and does not suffer my feet to be moved.

019	PSA	066	011	Thou broughtest us into the snare; thou laidest afflictions on our back.
019	PSA	066	012	Thou didst mount men upon our heads; we went through the fire and water; but thou broughtest us out into [a place of] refreshment.
019	PSA	066	013	I will go into thine house with whole-burnt-offerings; I will pay thee my vows,
019	PSA	066	014	which my lips framed, and my mouth uttered in my affliction.
019	PSA	066	015	I will offer to thee whole-burnt-sacrifices full of marrow, with incense and rams; I will sacrifice to thee oxen with goats. (Pause)

019	PSA	066	017	I cried to him with my mouth, and exalted him with my tongue.
019	PSA	066	018	If I have regarded iniquity in my heart, let not the Lord hearken [to me].
019	PSA	066	019	Therefore God has hearkened to me; he has attended to the voice of my prayer.
019	PSA	066	020	Blessed be God, who has not turned away my prayer, nor his mercy from me.
019	PSA	067	001	For the end, a Psalm of David among the Hymns. God be merciful to us, and bless us; [and] cause his face to shine upon us. (Pause)

019	PSA	068	002	As smoke vanishes, let them vanish: as wax melts before the fire, so let the sinners perish from before God.
019	PSA	068	003	But let the righteous rejoice; let them exult before God: let them be delighted with joy.
019	PSA	068	004	Sing to God, sing praises to his name: make a way for him that rides upon the west (the Lord is his name) and exult before him. They shall be troubled before the face of him,
019	PSA	068	005	[who is] the father of the orphans, and judge of the widows: [such is] God in his holy place.
019	PSA	068	006	God settles the solitary in a house; leading forth prisoners mightily, also them that act provokingly, [even] them that dwell in tombs.
019	PSA	068	007	O God, when thou wentest forth before thy people, when thou wentest through the wilderness; (Pause)
019	PSA	068	008	the earth quaked, yea, the heavens dropped [water] at the presence of the God of Sina, at the presence of the God of Israel.
019	PSA	068	009	O God, thou wilt grant to thine inheritance a gracious rain; for it was weary, but thou didst refresh it.
019	PSA	068	010	Thy creatures dwell in it: thou hast in thy goodness prepared for the poor.
019	PSA	068	011	The Lord God will give a word to them that preach [it] in a great company.
019	PSA	068	012	The king of the forces of the beloved, of the beloved, [will] even [grant them] for the beauty of the house to divide the spoils.

019	PSA	068	014	When the heavenly One scatters kings upon it, they shall be made snow-white in Selmon.
019	PSA	068	015	The mountain of God is a rich mountain; a swelling mountain, a rich mountain.
019	PSA	068	016	Wherefore do ye conceive [evil], ye swelling mountains? [this is] the mountain which God has delighted to dwell in; yea, the Lord will dwell [in it] for ever.
019	PSA	068	017	The chariots of God are ten thousand fold, thousands of rejoicing ones: the Lord is among them, in Sina, in the holy place.
019	PSA	068	018	Thou art gone up on high, thou hast led captivity captive, thou hast received gifts for man, yea, for [they were] rebellious, that thou mightest dwell among them.
019	PSA	068	019	Blessed be the Lord God, blessed be the Lord daily; and the God of our salvation shall prosper us. (Pause)
019	PSA	068	020	Our God is the God of salvation; and to the Lord belong the issues from death.

019	PSA	068	022	The Lord said, I will bring again from Basan, I will bring [my people] again through the depths of the sea.
019	PSA	068	023	That thy foot may be dipped in blood, [and] the tongue of thy dogs [be stained] with that of [thine] enemies.
019	PSA	068	024	Thy goings, O God, have been seen; the goings of my God, the king, in the sanctuary.
019	PSA	068	025	The princes went first, next before the players on instruments, in the midst of damsels playing on timbrels.
019	PSA	068	026	Praise God in the congregations, the Lord from the fountains of Israel.

019	PSA	068	028	O God, command thou thy strength: strengthen, O God, this which thou hast wrought in us.
019	PSA	068	029	Because of thy temple at Jerusalem shall kings bring presents to thee.
019	PSA	068	030	Rebuke the wild beasts of the reed: let the crowd of bulls with the heifers of the nations [be rebuked], so that they who have been proved with silver may not be shut out: scatter thou the nations that wish for wars.
019	PSA	068	031	Ambassadors shall arrive out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall hasten [to stretch out] her hand readily to God.
019	PSA	068	032	Sing to God, ye kingdoms of the earth; sing psalms to the Lord. (Pause)
019	PSA	068	033	Sing to God that rides on the heaven of heaven, eastward: lo, he will utter a mighty sound with his voice.
019	PSA	068	034	Give ye glory to God: his excellency is over Israel, and his power is in the clouds.
019	PSA	068	035	God is wonderful in his holy [places], the God of Israel: he will give power and strength to his people: blessed be God.
019	PSA	069	001	For the end, [a Psalm] of David, for alternate [strains]. Save me, O God; for the waters have come in to my soul.
019	PSA	069	002	I am stuck fast in deep mire, and there is no standing: I am come in to the depths of the sea, and a storm has overwhelmed me.
019	PSA	069	003	I am weary [of] crying, my throat has become hoarse; mine eyes have failed by my waiting on my God.
019	PSA	069	004	They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head: my enemies that persecute me unrighteously are strengthened: then I restored that which I took not away.
019	PSA	069	005	O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my transgressions are not hidden from thee.
019	PSA	069	006	Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord of hosts, be ashamed on my account: let not them that seek thee, be ashamed on my account, O God of Israel.
019	PSA	069	007	For I have suffered reproach for thy sake; shame has covered my face.
019	PSA	069	008	I became strange to my brethren, and a stranger to my mother's children.
019	PSA	069	009	For the zeal of thine house has eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.
019	PSA	069	010	And I bowed down my soul with fasting, and that was made my reproach.
019	PSA	069	011	And I put on sackcloth for my covering; and I became a proverb to them.
019	PSA	069	012	They that sit in the gate talked against me, and they that drank wine sang against me.
019	PSA	069	013	But I [will cry] to thee, O Lord, in my prayer; O God, it is a propitious time: in the multitude of thy mercy hear me, in the truth of thy salvation.
019	PSA	069	014	Save me from the mire, that I stick not [in it]: let me be delivered from them that hate me, and from the deep waters.
019	PSA	069	015	Let not the waterflood drown me, nor let the deep swallow me up; neither let the well shut its mouth upon me.
019	PSA	069	016	Hear me, O Lord; for thy mercy is good: according to the multitude of thy compassions look upon me.
019	PSA	069	017	And turn not away thy face from thy servant; for I am afflicted: hear me speedily.
019	PSA	069	018	Draw nigh to my soul and redeem it: deliver me because of mine enemies.
019	PSA	069	019	For thou knowest my reproach, and my shame, and my confusion; all that afflict me are before thee.
019	PSA	069	020	My soul has waited for reproach and misery; and I waited for one to grieve with me, but there was none; and for one to comfort me, but I found none.
019	PSA	069	021	They gave [me] also gall for my food, and made me drink vinegar for my thirst.
019	PSA	069	022	Let their table before them be for a snare, and for a recompense, and for a stumbling-block.
019	PSA	069	023	Let their eyes be darkened that they should not see; and bow down their back continually.
019	PSA	069	024	Pour out thy wrath upon them, and let the fury of thine anger take hold on them.
019	PSA	069	025	Let their habitation be made desolate; and let there be no inhabitant in their tents:
019	PSA	069	026	Because they persecuted him whom thou hast smitten; and they have added to the grief of my wounds.
019	PSA	069	027	Add iniquity to their iniquity; and let them not come into thy righteousness.
019	PSA	069	028	Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and let them not be written with the righteous.
019	PSA	069	029	I am poor and sorrowful; but the salvation of thy countenance has helped me.
019	PSA	069	030	I will praise the name of my God with a song, I will magnify him with praise;
019	PSA	069	031	and [this] shall please God more than a young calf having horns and hoofs.
019	PSA	069	032	Let the poor see and rejoice; seek the Lord diligently, and ye shall live.
019	PSA	069	033	For the Lord hears the poor, and does not set at nought his fettered ones.
019	PSA	069	034	Let the heavens and the earth raise him, the sea, and all things moving in them.
019	PSA	069	035	For God will save Sion, and the cities of Judea shall be built; and [men] shall dwell there, and inherit it.
019	PSA	069	036	And the seed of his servants shall possess it, and they that love his name shall dwell therein.
019	PSA	070	001	For the end, by David for a remembrance, that the Lord may save me. Draw nigh, O God, to my help.
019	PSA	070	002	Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek my soul: let them be turned backward and put to shame, that wish me evil.
019	PSA	070	003	Let them that say to me, Aha, aha, be turned back and put to shame immediately.
019	PSA	070	004	Let all that seek thee exult and be glad in thee: and let those that love thy salvation say continually, Let God be magnified.
019	PSA	070	005	But I am poor and needy; O God, help me: thou art my helper and deliverer, O Lord, delay not.
019	PSA	071	001	By David, [a Psalm sung by] the sons of Jonadab, and the first that were taken captive. O Lord, I have hoped in thee: let me never be put to shame.
019	PSA	071	002	In thy righteousness deliver me and rescue me: incline thine ear to me, and save me.
019	PSA	071	003	Be to me a protecting God, and a strong hold to save me: for thou art my fortress and my refuge.
019	PSA	071	004	Deliver me, O my God, from the hand of the sinner, from the hand of the transgressor and unjust man.
019	PSA	071	005	For thou art my support, O Lord; O Lord, [thou art] my hope from my youth.
019	PSA	071	006	On thee have I been stayed from the womb: from the belly of my mother thou art my protector: of thee is my praise continually.
019	PSA	071	007	I am become as it were a wonder to many: but thou art [my] strong helper.
019	PSA	071	008	Let my mouth be filled with praise, that I may hymn thy glory, [and] thy majesty all the day.
019	PSA	071	009	Cast me not off at the time of old age; forsake me not when my strength fails.
019	PSA	071	010	For mine enemies have spoken against me; and they that lay wait for my soul have taken counsel together,
019	PSA	071	011	saying, God has forsaken him: persecute ye and take him; for there is none to deliver [him].
019	PSA	071	012	O God, go not far from me, O my God, draw nigh to my help.
019	PSA	071	013	Let those that plot against my soul be ashamed and utterly fail: let those that seek my hurt be clothed with shame and dishonour.
019	PSA	071	014	But I will hope continually, and will praise thee more and more.
019	PSA	071	015	My mouth shall declare thy righteousness openly, [and] thy salvation all the day; for I am not acquainted with the affairs [of men].
019	PSA	071	016	I will go on in the might of the Lord: O Lord, I will make mention of thy righteousness only.
019	PSA	071	017	O God, thou hast taught me from my youth, and until now will I declare thy wonders;
019	PSA	071	018	even until I am old and advanced in years. O God, forsake me not; until I shall have declared thine arm to all the generation that is to come:
019	PSA	071	019	even thy power and thy righteousness, O God, up to the highest [heavens, even] the mighty works which thou has done: O God, who is like to thee?
019	PSA	071	020	What afflictions many and sore hast thou shewed me! yet thou didst turn and quicken me, and broughtest me again from the depths of the earth.
019	PSA	071	021	Thou didst multiply thy righteousness, and didst turn and comfort me, and broughtest me again out of the depths of the earth.
019	PSA	071	022	I will also therefore give thanks to thee, O God, [because of] thy truth, on an instrument of psalmody: I will sing psalms to thee on the harp, O Holy One of Israel.
019	PSA	071	023	My lips shall rejoice when I sing to thee; and my soul, which thou hast redeemed.
019	PSA	071	024	Moreover also my tongue shall dwell all the day upon thy righteousness; when they shall be ashamed and confounded that seek my hurt.
019	PSA	072	001	For Solomon. O God, give thy judgment to the king, and thy righteousness to the king's son;
019	PSA	072	002	[that he may] judge thy people with righteousness, and thy poor with judgment.
019	PSA	072	003	Let the mountains and the hills raise peace to thy people:
019	PSA	072	004	he shall judge the poor of the people in righteousness, and save the children of the needy; and shall bring low the false accuser.
019	PSA	072	005	And he shall continue as long as the sun, and before the moon for ever.
019	PSA	072	006	He shall come down as rain upon a fleece; and as drops falling upon the earth.
019	PSA	072	007	In his days shall righteousness spring up; and abundance of peace till the moon be removed.
019	PSA	072	008	And he shall have dominion from sea to sea, and from the river to the ends of the earth.
019	PSA	072	009	The Ethiopians shall fall down before him; and his enemies shall lick the dust.
019	PSA	072	010	The kings of Tharsis, and the isles, shall bring presents: the kings of the Arabians and Saba shall offer gifts.
019	PSA	072	011	And all kings shall worship him; all the Gentiles shall serve him.
019	PSA	072	012	For he has delivered the poor from the oppressor; and the needy who had no helper.
019	PSA	072	013	He shall spare the poor and needy, and shall deliver the souls of the needy.
019	PSA	072	014	He shall redeem their souls from usury and injustice: and their name [shall be] precious before him.
019	PSA	072	015	And he shall live, and there shall be given him of the gold of Arabia: and [men] shall pray for him continually; [and] all the day shall they praise him.
019	PSA	072	016	There shall be an establishment on the earth on the tops of the mountains: the fruit thereof shall be exalted above Libanus, and they of the city shall flourish as grass of the earth.
019	PSA	072	017	Let his name be blessed for ever: his name shall endure longer than the sun: and all the tribes of the earth shall be blessed in him: all nations shall call him blessed.
019	PSA	072	018	Blessed is the Lord God of Israel, who alone does wonders.
019	PSA	072	019	And blessed is his glorious name for ever, even for ever and ever: and all the earth shall be filled with his glory. So be it, so be it.
019	PSA	072	020	The hymns of David the son of Jessae are ended.
019	PSA	073	001	A Psalm for Asaph. How good is God to Israel, to the upright in heart!
019	PSA	073	002	But my feet were almost overthrown; my goings very nearly slipped.
019	PSA	073	003	For I was jealous of the transgressors, beholding the tranquility of sinners.
019	PSA	073	004	For there is no sign of reluctance in their death: and [they have] firmness under their affliction.
019	PSA	073	005	They are not in the troubles of [other] men; and they shall not be scourged with [other] men.
019	PSA	073	006	Therefore pride has possessed them; they have clothed themselves with their injustice and ungodliness.
019	PSA	073	007	Their injustice shall go forth as out of fatness: they have fulfilled their intention.
019	PSA	073	008	They have taken counsel and spoken in wickedness: they have uttered unrighteousness loftily.
019	PSA	073	009	They have set their mouth against heaven, and their tongue has gone through upon the earth.
019	PSA	073	010	Therefore shall my people return hither: and full days shall be found with them.
019	PSA	073	011	And they said, How does God know? and is there knowledge in the Most High?
019	PSA	073	012	Behold, these [are] the sinners, and they that prosper always: they have possessed wealth.
019	PSA	073	013	And I said, Verily in vain have I justified my heart, and washed my hands in innocency.
019	PSA	073	014	For I was plagued all the day, and my reproof [was] every morning.
019	PSA	073	015	If I said, I will speak thus; behold, I [should] have broken covenant with the generation of thy children.
019	PSA	073	016	And I undertook to understand this, [but] it is too hard for me,
019	PSA	073	017	until I go into the sanctuary of God; [and so] understand the latter end.
019	PSA	073	018	Surely thou hast appointed [judgments] to them because of their crafty dealings: thou hast cast them down when they were lifted up.
019	PSA	073	019	How have they become desolate! suddenly they have failed: they have perished because of their iniquity.
019	PSA	073	020	As the dream of one awakening, O Lord, in thy city thou wilt despise their image.
019	PSA	073	021	For my heart has rejoiced, and my reins have been gladdened.
019	PSA	073	022	But I [was] vile and knew not: I became brutish before thee.
019	PSA	073	023	Yet I am continually with thee: thou hast holden my right hand.
019	PSA	073	024	Thou hast guided me by thy counsel, and thou hast taken me to thyself with glory.
019	PSA	073	025	For what have I in heaven [but thee]? and what have I desired upon the earth beside thee?
019	PSA	073	026	My heart and my flesh have failed: [but] God [is the strength] of my heart, and God is my portion for ever.
019	PSA	073	027	For, behold, they that remove themselves far from thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed every one that goes a whoring from thee.
019	PSA	073	028	But it is good for me to cleave close to God, to put my trust in the Lord; that I may proclaim all thy praises in the gates of the daughter of Sion.
019	PSA	074	001	[A Psalm] of instruction for Asaph. Wherefore hast thou rejected [us], O God, for ever? [wherefore] is thy wrath kindled against the sheep of thy pasture?
019	PSA	074	002	Remember thy congregation which thou hast purchased from the beginning; thou didst ransom the rod of thine inheritance; this mount Sion wherein thou hast dwelt.
019	PSA	074	003	Lift up thine hands against their pride continually; [because of] all that the enemy has done wickedly in thy holy places.
019	PSA	074	004	And they that hate thee have boasted in the midst of thy feast; they have set up their standards for signs,
019	PSA	074	005	ignorantly as it were in the entrance above;
019	PSA	074	006	they cut down its doors at once with axes as in a wood of trees; they have broken it down with hatchet and stone cutter.
019	PSA	074	007	They have burnt thy sanctuary with fire to the ground; they have profaned the habitation of thy name.
019	PSA	074	008	They have said in their heart, [even] all their kindred together, Come, let us abolish the feasts of the Lord from the earth.
019	PSA	074	009	We have not seen our signs; there is no longer a prophet; and [God] will not know us any more.
019	PSA	074	010	How long, O God, shall the enemy reproach? shall the enemy provoke thy name forever?
019	PSA	074	011	Wherefore turnest thou away thine hand, and thy right hand from the midst of thy bosom for ever?
019	PSA	074	012	But God is our King of old; he has wrought salvation in the midst of the earth.
019	PSA	074	013	Thou didst establish the sea, in thy might, thou didst break to pieces the heads of the dragons in the water.
019	PSA	074	014	Thou didst break to pieces the heads of the dragon; thou didst give him [for] meat to the Ethiopian nations.
019	PSA	074	015	Thou didst cleave fountains and torrents; thou driedst up mighty rivers.
019	PSA	074	016	The day is thine, and the night is thine; thou hast prepared the sun and the moon.
019	PSA	074	017	Thou hast made all the borders of the earth; thou hast made summer and spring.
019	PSA	074	018	Remember this thy creation: an enemy has reproached the Lord, and a foolish people has provoked thy name.
019	PSA	074	019	Deliver not to the wild beasts a soul that gives praise to thee: forget not for ever the souls of thy poor.
019	PSA	074	020	Look upon thy covenant: for the dark [places] of the earth are filled with the habitations of iniquity.
019	PSA	074	021	let not the afflicted and shamed one be rejected: the poor and needy shall praise thy name.
019	PSA	074	022	Arise, O God, plead thy cause: remember thy reproaches that come from the foolish one all the day.
019	PSA	074	023	Forget not the voice of thy suppliants: let the pride of them that hate thee continually ascend before thee.
019	PSA	075	001	For the end, Destroy not, a Psalm of a Song for Asaph. We will give thanks to thee, O God, we will give thanks, and call upon thy name: I will declare all thy wonderful works.
019	PSA	075	002	When I shall take a set time, I will judge righteously.
019	PSA	075	003	The earth is dissolved, and all that dwell in it: I have strengthened its pillars. (Pause)
019	PSA	075	004	I said unto the transgressors, Do not transgress; and to the sinners, Lift not up the horn.
019	PSA	075	005	Lift not up your horn on high; speak not unrighteousness against God.
019	PSA	075	006	For [good comes] neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the desert mountains.
019	PSA	075	007	For God is the judge; he puts down one, and raises up another.
019	PSA	075	008	For [there is] a cup in the hand of the Lord, full of unmingled wine; and he has turned [it] from side to side, but its dregs have not been wholly poured out; all the sinners of the earth shall drink [them].
019	PSA	075	009	But I will exult for ever: I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.
019	PSA	075	010	And I will break all the horns of sinners; but the horns of the righteous one shall be exalted.
019	PSA	076	001	For the end, among the Hymns, a Psalm for Asaph; a Song for the Assyrian. God is known in Judea: his name is great in Israel.
019	PSA	076	002	And his place has been in peace, and his dwelling-place in Sion.
019	PSA	076	003	There he broke the power of the bows, the shield, and the sword, and the battle. (Pause)
019	PSA	076	004	Thou dost wonderfully shine forth from the everlasting mountains.
019	PSA	076	005	All the simple ones in heart were troubled; all the men of wealth have slept their sleep, and have found nothing in their hands.
019	PSA	076	006	At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, the riders on horses slumbered.
019	PSA	076	007	Thou art terrible; and who shall withstand thee, because of thine anger?
019	PSA	076	008	Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven; the earth feared, and was still,
019	PSA	076	009	when God arose to judgment, to save all the meek in heart. (Pause)
019	PSA	076	010	For the inward thought of man shall give thanks to thee: and the memorial of his inward thought shall keep a feast to thee.
019	PSA	076	011	Vow, and pay [your vows] to the Lord our God; all that are round about him shall bring gifts, [even] to him that is terrible,
019	PSA	076	012	and that takes away the spirits of princes; to him that is terrible among the kings of the earth.
019	PSA	077	001	For the end, for Idithun, a Psalm of Asaph. I cried to the Lord with my voice, yea, my voice [was addressed] to God; and he gave heed to me.
019	PSA	077	002	In the day of mine affliction I earnestly sought the Lord; [even] with my hands by night before him, and I was not deceived; my soul refused to be comforted.
019	PSA	077	003	I remembered God, and rejoiced; I poured out my complaint, and my soul fainted. (Pause)
019	PSA	077	004	All mine enemies set a watch [against me]: I was troubled, and spoke not.
019	PSA	077	005	I considered the days of old, and remembered ancient years.
019	PSA	077	006	And I meditated; I communed with my heart by night, and diligently searched my spirit, [saying],
019	PSA	077	007	Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be well pleased no more?
019	PSA	077	008	Will he cut off his mercy for ever, even for ever and ever?
019	PSA	077	009	Will God forget to pity? or will he shut up his compassions in his wrath? (Pause)
019	PSA	077	010	And I said, Now I have begun; this is the change of the right hand of the Most High.
019	PSA	077	011	I remembered the works of the Lord; for I will remember thy wonders from the beginning.
019	PSA	077	012	And I will meditate on all thy works, and will consider thy doings.
019	PSA	077	013	O God, thy way is in the sanctuary; who is a great God as our God?
019	PSA	077	014	Thou art the God that doest wonders; thou hast made known thy power among the nations.
019	PSA	077	015	Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. (Pause)
019	PSA	077	016	The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee, and feared; and the depths were troubled.
019	PSA	077	017	[There was] an abundant sound of waters: the clouds uttered a voice; for thine arrows went abroad.
019	PSA	077	018	The voice of thy thunder was abroad, and around thy lightnings appeared to the world; the earth trembled a quaked.
019	PSA	077	019	Thy way is in the sea, and thy paths in many waters, and thy footsteps cannot be known.
019	PSA	077	020	Thou didst guide thy people as sheep by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
019	PSA	078	001	[A Psalm] of instruction for Asaph. Give heed, O my people, to my law: incline your ear to the words of my mouth.
019	PSA	078	002	I will open my mouth in parables: I will utter dark sayings [which have been] from the beginning.
019	PSA	078	003	All which we have heard and known, and our fathers have declared to us.
019	PSA	078	004	They were not hid from their children to a second generations; [the fathers] declaring the praises of the Lord, and his mighty acts, and his wonders which he wrought.
019	PSA	078	005	And he raised up a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, to make it known to their children:
019	PSA	078	006	that another generation might know, even the sons which should be born; and they should arise and declare them to their children.
019	PSA	078	007	That they might set their hope on God, and not forget the works of God, but diligently seek his commandments.
019	PSA	078	008	That they should not be as their fathers, a perverse and provoking generation; a generation which set not its heart aright, and its spirit was not steadfast with God.
019	PSA	078	009	The children of Ephraim, bending and shooting [with] the bow, turned [back] in the day of battle.
019	PSA	078	010	They kept not the covenant of God, and would not walk in his law.
019	PSA	078	011	And they forgot his benefits, and his miracles which he [had] shewed them;
019	PSA	078	012	the miracles which he wrought before their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the plain of Tanes.
019	PSA	078	013	He clave the sea, and led them through: he made the waters to stand as [in] a bottle.
019	PSA	078	014	And he guided them with a cloud by day, and all the night with a light of fire.
019	PSA	078	015	he clave a rock in the wilderness, and made them drink as in a great deep.
019	PSA	078	016	And he brought water out of the rock, and caused waters to flow down as rivers.
019	PSA	078	017	And they sinned yet more against him; they provoked the Most High in the wilderness.
019	PSA	078	018	And they tempted God in their hearts, in asking meat for [the desire of] their souls.
019	PSA	078	019	They spoke also against God, and said, Will God be able to prepare a table in the wilderness?
019	PSA	078	020	Forasmuch as he smote the rock, and the waters flowed, and the torrents ran abundantly; will he be able also to give bread, or prepare a table for his people?
019	PSA	078	021	Therefore the Lord heard, and was provoked: and fire was kindled in Jacob, and wrath went up against Israel.
019	PSA	078	022	Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation.
019	PSA	078	023	Yet he commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven,
019	PSA	078	024	and rained upon them manna to eat, and gave them the bread of heaven.
019	PSA	078	025	Man ate angels' bread; he sent them provision to the full.
019	PSA	078	026	He removed the south wind from heaven; and by his might he brought in the south-west wind.
019	PSA	078	027	And he rained upon them flesh like dust, and feathered birds like the sand of the seas.
019	PSA	078	028	And they fell into the midst of their camp, round about their tents.
019	PSA	078	029	So they ate, and were completely filled; and he gave them their desire.
019	PSA	078	030	They were not disappointed of their desire: [but] when their food was yet in their mouth,
019	PSA	078	031	then the indignation of God rose up against them, and slew the fattest of them, and overthrew the choice men of Israel.
019	PSA	078	032	In the midst of all this they sinned yet more, and believed not his miracles.
019	PSA	078	033	And their days were consumed in vanity, and their years with anxiety.
019	PSA	078	034	When he slew them, they sought him: and they returned and called betimes upon God.
019	PSA	078	035	And they remembered that God was their helper, and the most high God was their redeemer.
019	PSA	078	036	Yet they loved him [only] with their mouth, and lied to him with their tongue.
019	PSA	078	037	For their heart [was] not right with him, neither were they steadfast in his covenant.
019	PSA	078	038	But he is compassionate, and will forgive their sins, and will not destroy [them]: yea, he will frequently turn away his wrath, and will not kindle all his anger.
019	PSA	078	039	And he remembered that they are flesh; a wind that passes away, and returns not.
019	PSA	078	040	How often did they provoke him in the wilderness, [and] anger him in a dry land!
019	PSA	078	041	Yea, they turned back, and tempted God, and provoked the Holy One of Israel.
019	PSA	078	042	They remembered not his hand, the day in which he delivered them from the hand of the oppressor.
019	PSA	078	043	How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Tanes:
019	PSA	078	044	and had changed their rivers into blood; and their streams, that they should not drink.
019	PSA	078	045	He sent against them the dog-fly, and it devoured them; and the frog, and it spoiled them.
019	PSA	078	046	And he gave their fruit to the canker worm, and their labours to the locust.
019	PSA	078	047	He killed their vines with hail, and their sycamores with frost.
019	PSA	078	048	And he gave up their cattle to hail, and their substance to the fire.
019	PSA	078	049	He sent out against them the fury of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and affliction, a message by evil angels.
019	PSA	078	050	He made a way for his wrath; he spared not their souls from death, but consigned their cattle to death;
019	PSA	078	051	and smote every first-born in the land of Egypt; the first-fruits of their labours in the tents of Cham.
019	PSA	078	052	And he removed his people like sheep; he led them as a flock in the wilderness.
019	PSA	078	053	And he guided them with hope, and they feared not: but the sea covered their enemies.
019	PSA	078	054	And he brought them in to the mountain of his sanctuary, this mountain which his right hand had purchased.
019	PSA	078	055	And he cast out the nations from before them, and made them to inherit by a line of inheritance, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.
019	PSA	078	056	Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies.
019	PSA	078	057	And they turned back, and broke covenant, even as also their fathers: they became like a crooked bow.
019	PSA	078	058	And they provoked him with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.
019	PSA	078	059	God heard and lightly regarded [them], and greatly despised Israel.
019	PSA	078	060	And he rejected the tabernacle of Selom, his tent where he dwelt among men.
019	PSA	078	061	And he gave their strength into captivity, and their beauty into the enemy's hand.
019	PSA	078	062	And he gave his people to the sword; and disdained his inheritance.
019	PSA	078	063	Fire devoured their young men; and their virgins mourned not.
019	PSA	078	064	Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows shall not be wept for.
019	PSA	078	065	So the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, [and] as a mighty man who has been heated with wine.
019	PSA	078	066	And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he brought on them a perpetual reproach.
019	PSA	078	067	And he rejected the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim;
019	PSA	078	068	but chose the tribe of Juda, the mount Sion which he loved.
019	PSA	078	069	And he built his sanctuary as [the place] of unicorns; he founded it for ever on the earth.
019	PSA	078	070	He chose David also his servant, and took him up from the flocks of sheep.
019	PSA	078	071	He took him from following the ewes great with young, to be the shepherd of Jacob his servant, and Israel his inheritance.
019	PSA	078	072	So he tended them in the innocency of his heart; and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.
019	PSA	079	001	A Psalm for Asaph. O God, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; they have polluted thy holy temple; they have made Jerusalem a storehouse of fruits.
019	PSA	079	002	They have given the dead bodies of thy servants [to be] food for the birds of the sky, the flesh of thy holy ones for the wild beasts of the earth.
019	PSA	079	003	They have shed their blood as water, round about Jerusalem; and there was none to bury [them].
019	PSA	079	004	We are become a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and derision to them [that are] round about us.
019	PSA	079	005	How long, O Lord? wilt thou be angry for ever? shall thy jealousy burn like fire?
019	PSA	079	006	Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee, and upon the kingdoms which have not called upon thy name.
019	PSA	079	007	For they have devoured Jacob, and laid his place waste.
019	PSA	079	008	Remember not our old transgressions; let thy tender mercies speedily prevent us; for we are greatly impoverished.
019	PSA	079	009	Help us, O God our Saviour; for the glory of thy name, O Lord, deliver us; and be merciful to our sins, for thy name's sake.
019	PSA	079	010	Lets haply they should say among the heathen, Where is their God? and let the avenging of thy servant's blood that has been shed be known among the heathen before our eyes.
019	PSA	079	011	Let the groaning of the prisoners come in before thee; according to the greatness of thine arm preserve the sons of the slain ones.
019	PSA	079	012	Repay to our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their reproach, with which they have reproached thee, O Lord.
019	PSA	079	013	For we are thy people and the sheep of thy pasture; we will give thee thanks for ever; we will declare thy praise throughout all generations.
019	PSA	080	001	For the end, for alternate [strains], a testimony for Asaph, a Psalm concerning the Assyrian. Attend, O Shepherd of Israel, who guidest Joseph like a flock; thou who sittest upon the cherubs, manifest thyself;
019	PSA	080	002	before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasse, stir up thy power, and come to deliver us.
019	PSA	080	003	Turn us, O God, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be delivered.
019	PSA	080	004	O Lord God of hosts, how long art thou angry with the prayer of thy servant?
019	PSA	080	005	Thou wilt feed us with bread of tears; and wilt cause us to drink tears by measure.
019	PSA	080	006	Thou has made us a strife to our neighbours; and our enemies have mocked at us.
019	PSA	080	007	Turn us, O Lord God of hosts, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved. (Pause)
019	PSA	080	008	Thou hast transplanted a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it.
019	PSA	080	009	Thou madest a way before it, and didst cause its roots to strike, and the land was filled [with it].
019	PSA	080	010	Its shadow covered the mountains, and its shoots [equalled] the goodly cedars.
019	PSA	080	011	It sent forth its branches to the sea, and its shoots to the river.
019	PSA	080	012	Wherefore hast thou broken down its hedge, while all that pass by the way pluck it?
019	PSA	080	013	The boar out of the wood has laid it waste, and the wild beast has devoured it.
019	PSA	080	014	O God of hosts, turn, we pray thee: look on [us] from heaven, and behold and visit this vine;
019	PSA	080	015	and restore that which thy right hand has planted: and look on the son of man whom thou didst strengthen for thyself.
019	PSA	080	016	[It is] burnt with fire and dug up: they shall perish at the rebuke of thy presence.
019	PSA	080	017	Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, and upon the son of man whom thou didst strengthen for thyself.
019	PSA	080	018	So will we not depart from thee: thou shalt quicken us, and we will call upon thy name.
019	PSA	080	019	Turn us, O Lord God of hosts, and make thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.
019	PSA	081	001	For the end, a Psalm for Asaph, concerning the wine-presses. Rejoice ye in God our helper; shout aloud to the God of Jacob.
019	PSA	081	002	Take a psalm, and produce the timbrel, the pleasant psaltery with the harp.
019	PSA	081	003	Blow the trumpet at the new moon, in the glorious day of your feast.
019	PSA	081	004	For [this] is an ordinance for Israel, and a statute of the God of Jacob.
019	PSA	081	005	He made it [to be] a testimony in Joseph, when he came forth out of the land of Egypt: he heard a language which he understood not.
019	PSA	081	006	He removed his back from burdens: his hands slaved in making the baskets.
019	PSA	081	007	Thou didst call upon me in trouble, and I delivered thee; I heard thee in the secret place of the storm: I proved thee at the water of Strife. (Pause)
019	PSA	081	008	Hear, my people, and I will speak to thee, O Israel; and I will testify to thee: if thou wilt hearken to me;
019	PSA	081	009	there shall be no new god in thee; neither shalt thou worship a strange god.
019	PSA	081	010	For I am the Lord thy God, that brought thee out of the land of Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.
019	PSA	081	011	But my people hearkened not to my voice; and Israel gave no heed to me.
019	PSA	081	012	So I let them go after the ways of their own hearts: they will go on in their own ways.
019	PSA	081	013	If my people had hearkened to me, if Israel had walked in my ways,
019	PSA	081	014	I should have put down their enemies very quickly, and should have laid my hand upon those that afflicted them.
019	PSA	081	015	The Lord's enemies [should have] lied to him: but their time shall be for ever.
019	PSA	081	016	And he fed them with the fat of wheat; and satisfied them with honey out of the rock.
019	PSA	082	001	A Psalm for Asaph. God stands in the assembly of gods; and in the midst [of them] will judge gods.
019	PSA	082	002	How long will ye judge unrighteously, and accept the persons of sinners? (Pause)
019	PSA	082	003	Judge the orphan and poor: do justice to the low and needy.
019	PSA	082	004	Rescue the needy, and deliver the poor out of the hand of the sinner.
019	PSA	082	005	They know not, nor understand; they walk on in darkness: all the foundations of the earth shall be shaken.
019	PSA	082	006	I have said, Ye are gods; and all [of you] children of the Most High.
019	PSA	082	007	But ye die as men, and fall as one of the princes.
019	PSA	082	008	Arise, O God, judge the earth: for thou shalt inherit all nations.
019	PSA	083	001	A Song of a Psalm for Asaph. O God, who shall be compared to thee? be not silent, neither be still, O God.
019	PSA	083	002	For behold, thine enemies have made a noise; and they that hate thee have lifted up the head.
019	PSA	083	003	Against thy people they have craftily imagined a device, and have taken counsel against thy saints.
019	PSA	083	004	They have said, Come, and let us utterly destroy them out of the nation; and let the name of Israel be remembered no more at all.
019	PSA	083	005	For they have taken counsel together with one consent: they have made a confederacy against thee;
019	PSA	083	006	even the tents of the Idumeans, and the Ismaelites; Moab, and the Agarenes;
019	PSA	083	007	Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalec; the Philistines also, with them that dwell at Tyre.
019	PSA	083	008	Yea, Assur too is come with them: they have become a help to the children of Lot. (Pause)
019	PSA	083	009	Do thou to them as to Madiam, and to Sisera; as to Jabin at the brook of Kison.
019	PSA	083	010	They were utterly destroyed at Aendor: they became as dung for the earth.
019	PSA	083	011	Make their princes as Oreb and Zeb, and Zebee and Salmana; [even] all their princes:
019	PSA	083	012	who said, let us take to ourselves the altar of God as an inheritance.
019	PSA	083	013	O my God, make them as a wheel; as stubble before the face of the wind.
019	PSA	083	014	As fire which shall burn up a wood, as the flame may consume the mountains;
019	PSA	083	015	so shalt thou persecute them with thy tempest, and trouble them in thine anger.
019	PSA	083	016	Fill their faces with dishonour; so shall they seek thy name, O Lord.
019	PSA	083	017	Let them be ashamed and troubled for evermore; yea, let them be confounded and destroyed.
019	PSA	083	018	And let them know that thy name is Lord; that thou alone art Most High over all the earth.
019	PSA	084	001	For the end, a Psalm for the sons of Core, concerning the wine-presses. How amiable are thy tabernacles, O Lord of hosts!
019	PSA	084	002	My soul longs, and faints for the courts of the Lord: my heart and my flesh have exulted in the living god.
019	PSA	084	003	Yea, the sparrow has found himself a home, and the turtle-dove a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, [even] thine altars, O Lord of hosts, my King, and my God.
019	PSA	084	004	Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will praise thee evermore. (Pause)
019	PSA	084	005	Blessed is the man whose help is of thee, O Lord; in his heart he has purposed to go up
019	PSA	084	006	the valley of weeping, to the place which he has appointed, for [there] the law-giver will grant blessings.
019	PSA	084	007	They shall go from strength to strength: the God of gods shall be seen in Sion.
019	PSA	084	008	O Lord God of hosts, hear my prayer: hearken, O God of Jacob. (Pause)
019	PSA	084	009	Behold, O God our defender, and look upon the face of thine anointed.
019	PSA	084	010	For one day in thy courts is better than thousands. I would rather be an abject in the house of God, than dwell in the tents of sinners.
019	PSA	084	011	For the Lord loves mercy and truth: God will give grace and glory: the Lord will not withhold good things from them that walk in innocence.
019	PSA	084	012	O Lord of hosts, blessed is the man that trusts in thee.
019	PSA	085	001	For the end, a Psalm for the sons of Core. O Lord, thou has taken pleasure in thy land: thou hast turned back the captivity of Jacob.
019	PSA	085	002	Thou hast forgiven thy people their transgressions; thou has covered all their sins. (Pause)
019	PSA	085	003	Thou has caused all thy wrath to cease: thou hast turned from thy fierce anger.
019	PSA	085	004	Turn us, O God of our salvation, and turn thy anger away from us.
019	PSA	085	005	Wouldest thou be angry with us for ever? or wilt thou continue thy wrath from generation to generation?
019	PSA	085	006	O God, thou wilt turn and quicken us; and thy people shall rejoice in thee.
019	PSA	085	007	Shew us thy mercy, O Lord, and grant us thy salvation.
019	PSA	085	008	I will hear what the Lord God will say concerning me: for he shall speak peace to his people, and to his saints, and to those that turn their heart toward him.
019	PSA	085	009	Moreover his salvation is near them that fear him; that glory may dwell in our land.
019	PSA	085	010	Mercy and truth are met together: righteousness and peace have kissed [each other].
019	PSA	085	011	Truth has sprung out of the earth; and righteousness has looked down from heaven.
019	PSA	085	012	For the Lord will give goodness; and our land shall yield her fruit.
019	PSA	085	013	Righteousness shall go before him; and shall set his steps in the way.
019	PSA	086	001	A Prayer of David. O Lord, incline thine ear, and hearken to me; for I am poor and needy.
019	PSA	086	002	Preserve my soul, for I am holy; save thy servant, O God, who hopes in thee.
019	PSA	086	003	Pity me, O Lord: for to thee will I cry all the day.
019	PSA	086	004	Rejoice the sold of thy servant: for to thee, O Lord, have I lifted up my soul.
019	PSA	086	005	For thou, O Lord, art kind, and gentle; and plenteous in mercy to all that call upon thee.
019	PSA	086	006	Give ear to my prayer, o Lord; and attend to the voice of my supplication.
019	PSA	086	007	In the day of my trouble I cried to thee: for thou didst hear me.
019	PSA	086	008	There is none like to thee, O Lord, among the god; and there are no [works] like to thy works.
019	PSA	086	009	All nations whom thou hast made shall come, and shall worship before thee, O Lord; and shall glorify thy name.
019	PSA	086	010	For thou art great, and doest wonders: thou art the only [and] the great God.
019	PSA	086	011	Guide me, O Lord, in thy way, and I will walk in thy truth: let my heart rejoice, that I may fear thy name.
019	PSA	086	012	I will give thee thanks, O Lord my God, with all my heart; and I will glorify thy name for ever.
019	PSA	086	013	For thy mercy is great toward me; and thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest hell.
019	PSA	086	014	O God, transgressors have risen up against me, and an assembly of violent [men] have sought my life; and have not set thee before them.
019	PSA	086	015	But thou, O Lord God, art compassionate and merciful, long-suffering, and abundant in mercy and true.
019	PSA	086	016	Look thou upon me, and have mercy upon me: give thy strength to thy servant, and save the son of thine handmaid.
019	PSA	086	017	Establish with me a token for good; and let them that hate me see [it] and be ashamed; because thou, O Lord, hast helped me, and comforted me.
019	PSA	087	001	A Psalm of a Song for the sons of Core. His foundations are in the holy mountains.
019	PSA	087	002	The Lord loves the gates of Sion, more than all the tabernacles of Jacob.
019	PSA	087	003	Glorious things have been spoken of thee, O city of God. (Pause)
019	PSA	087	004	I will make mention of Raab and Babylon to them that know me: behold also the Philistines, and Tyre, and the people of the Ethiopians: these were born there.
019	PSA	087	005	A man shall say, Sion [is my] mother; and [such] a man was born in her; and the Highest himself has founded her.
019	PSA	087	006	The Lord shall recount [it] in the writing of the people, and of these princes that were born in her.
019	PSA	087	007	The dwelling of all within thee is [as the dwelling] of those that rejoice.
019	PSA	088	001	A song of a Psalm for the sons of Core for the end, upon Maeleth for responsive [strains], of instruction for Aeman the Israelite. O Lord God of my salvation, I have cried by day and in the night before thee.
019	PSA	088	002	Let my prayer come in before thee; incline thine ear to my supplication, O Lord.
019	PSA	088	003	For my soul is filled with troubles, and my life has drawn nigh to Hades.
019	PSA	088	004	I have been reckoned with them that go down to the pit; I became as a man without help;
019	PSA	088	005	free among the dead, as the slain ones cast out, who sleep in the tomb; whom thou rememberest no more; and they are rejected from thy hand.
019	PSA	088	006	They laid me in the lowest pit, in dark [places], and in the shadow of death.
019	PSA	088	007	Thy wrath has pressed heavily upon me, and thou hast brought upon me all thy billows. (Pause)
019	PSA	088	008	Thou hast removed my acquaintance far from me; they have made me an abomination to themselves; I have been delivered up, and have not gone forth.
019	PSA	088	009	Mine eyes are dimmed from poverty; but I cried to thee, O Lord, all the day; I spread forth my hands to thee.
019	PSA	088	010	Wilt thou work wonders for the dead? or shall physicians raise [them] up, that they shall praise thee?
019	PSA	088	011	Shall any one declare thy mercy in the tomb? and thy truth in destruction?
019	PSA	088	012	Shall thy wonders be known in darkness? and thy righteousness in a forgotten land?
019	PSA	088	013	But I cried to thee, O Lord; and in the morning shall my prayer prevent thee.
019	PSA	088	014	Wherefore, O Lord, dost thou reject my prayer, [and] turn thy face away from me?
019	PSA	088	015	I am poor and in troubles from my youth; and having been exalted, I was brought low and into despair.
019	PSA	088	016	Thy wrath has passed over me; and thy terrors have greatly disquieted me.
019	PSA	088	017	They compassed me like water; all the day they beset me together.
019	PSA	088	018	Thou hast put far from me [every] friend, and mine acquaintances because of [my] wretchedness.
019	PSA	089	001	[A Psalm] of instruction for Aetham the Israelite. I will sing of thy mercies, O Lord, for ever: I will declare thy truth with my mouth to all generations.
019	PSA	089	002	For thou hast said, Mercy shall be built up for ever: thy truth shall be established in the heavens.
019	PSA	089	003	I made a covenant with my chosen ones, I sware unto David my servant.
019	PSA	089	004	I will establish thy seed for ever, and build up thy throne to all generations. (Pause)
019	PSA	089	005	The heavens shall declare thy wonders, O Lord; and thy truth in the assembly of the saints.
019	PSA	089	006	For who in the heavens shall be compared to the Lord? and who shall be likened to the Lord among the sons of God?
019	PSA	089	007	God is glorified in the council of the saints; great and terrible toward all that are round about him.
019	PSA	089	008	O Lord God of hosts, who is like to thee? thou art mighty, O Lord, and thy truth is round about thee.
019	PSA	089	009	Thou rulest the power of the sea; and thou calmest the tumult of its waves.
019	PSA	089	010	Thou has brought down the proud as one that is slain; and with the arm of thy power thou has scattered thine enemies.
019	PSA	089	011	The heavens are thine, and the earth is thine: thou hast founded the world, and the fullness of it.
019	PSA	089	012	Thou hast created the north and the west: Thabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy name.
019	PSA	089	013	Thine is the mighty arm: let thy hand be strengthened, let thy right hand be exalted.
019	PSA	089	014	Justice and judgment are the establishment of thy throne: mercy and truth shall go before thy face.
019	PSA	089	015	Blessed is the people that knows the joyful sound: they shall walk, O Lord, in the light of thy countenance.
019	PSA	089	016	And in thy name shall they rejoice all the day: and in thy righteousness shall they be exalted.
019	PSA	089	017	For thou art the boast of their strength; and in thy good pleasure shall our horn be exalted,
019	PSA	089	018	for [our] help is of the Lord; and of the Holy One of Israel, our king.
019	PSA	089	019	Then thou spokest in vision to thy children, and saidst, I have laid help on a mighty one; I have exalted one chosen out of my people.
019	PSA	089	020	I have found David my servant; I have anointed him by [my] holy mercy.
019	PSA	089	021	For my hand shall support him; and mine arm shall strengthen him.
019	PSA	089	022	The enemy shall have no advantage against him; and the son of transgression shall not hurt him again.
019	PSA	089	023	And I will hew down his foes before him, and put to flight those that hate him.
019	PSA	089	024	But my truth and my mercy shall be with him; and in my name shall his horn be exalted.
019	PSA	089	025	And I will set his hand in the sea, and his right hand in the rivers.
019	PSA	089	026	He shall call upon me, [saying], Thou art my Father, my God, and the helper of my salvation.
019	PSA	089	027	And I will make him [my] first-born, higher than the kings of the earth.
019	PSA	089	028	I will keep my mercy for him for ever, and my covenant [shall be] firm with him.
019	PSA	089	029	And I will establish his seed for ever and ever, and his throne as the days of heaven.
019	PSA	089	030	If his children should forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments;
019	PSA	089	031	if they should profane my ordinances, and not keep my commandments;
019	PSA	089	032	I will visit their transgressions with a rod, and their sins with scourges.
019	PSA	089	033	But my mercy I will not utterly remove from him, nor wrong my truth.
019	PSA	089	034	Neither will I by any means profane my covenant; and I will not make void the things that proceed out of my lips.
019	PSA	089	035	Once have I sworn by my holiness, that I will not lie to David.
019	PSA	089	036	His see shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me;
019	PSA	089	037	and as the moon [that is] established for ever, and as the faithful witness in heaven. (Pause)
019	PSA	089	038	But thou hast cast off and set at nought, thou has rejected thine anointed.
019	PSA	089	039	Thou hast overthrown the covenant of thy servant; thou has profaned his sanctuary, [casting it] to the ground.
019	PSA	089	040	Thou hast broken down all his hedges; thou hast made his strong holds a terror.
019	PSA	089	041	All that go by the way have spoiled him: he is become a reproach to his neighbours.
019	PSA	089	042	Thou hast exalted the right hand of his enemies; thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice.
019	PSA	089	043	Thou hast turned back the help of his sword, and hast not helped him in the battle.
019	PSA	089	044	Thou hast deprived him of glory: thou hast broken down his throne to the ground.
019	PSA	089	045	Thou hast shortened the days of his throne: thou hast poured shame upon him. (Pause)
019	PSA	089	046	How long, O Lord, wilt thou turn away, for ever? shall thine anger flame out as fire?
019	PSA	089	047	Remember what my being is: for hast thou created all the sons of men in vain?
019	PSA	089	048	What man is there who shall live, and not see death? shall [any one] deliver his soul from the hand of Hades? (Pause)
019	PSA	089	049	Where are thine ancient mercies, O Lord, which thou swarest to David in thy truth?
019	PSA	089	050	Remember, O Lord, the reproach of thy servants, which I have borne in my bosom, [even the reproach] of many nations;
019	PSA	089	051	wherewith thine enemies have reviled, O Lord: wherewith they have reviled the recompense of thine anointed.
019	PSA	089	052	Blessed be the Lord for ever. So be it, so be it.
019	PSA	090	001	A Prayer of Moses the man of God. Lord, thou hast been our refuge in all generations.
019	PSA	090	002	Before the mountains existed, and [before] the earth and the world were formed, even from age to age, Thou art.
019	PSA	090	003	Turn not man back to [his] low place, whereas thou saidst, Return, ye sons of men?
019	PSA	090	004	For a thousand years in thy sight are as the yesterday which is past, and as a watch in the night.
019	PSA	090	005	Years shall be vanity to them: let the morning pass away as grass.
019	PSA	090	006	In the morning let it flower, and pass away: in the evening let it droop, let it be withered and dried up.
019	PSA	090	007	For we have perished in thine anger, and in thy wrath we have been troubled.
019	PSA	090	008	Thou hast set our transgressions before thee: our age is in the light of thy countenance.
019	PSA	090	009	For all our days are gone, and we have passed away in thy wrath: our years have spun out their tale as a spider.
019	PSA	090	010	[As for] the days of our years, in them are seventy years; and if [men should be] in strength, eighty years: and the greater part of them would be labour and trouble; for weakness overtakes us, and we shall be chastened.
019	PSA	090	011	Who knows the power of thy wrath?
019	PSA	090	012	and [who knows how] to number [his days] because of the fear of thy wrath? So manifest thy right hand, and those that are instructed in wisdom in the heart.
019	PSA	090	013	Return, O Lord, how long? and be intreated concerning thy servants.
019	PSA	090	014	We have been satisfied in the morning with thy mercy; and we did exult and rejoice:
019	PSA	090	015	let us rejoice in all our days, in return for the days wherein thou didst afflict us, the years wherein we saw evil.
019	PSA	090	016	And look upon thy servants, and upon thy works; and guide their children.
019	PSA	090	017	And let the brightness of the Lord our God be upon us: and do thou direct for us the works of our hands.
019	PSA	091	001	Praise of a Song, by David. He that dwells in the help of the Highest, shall sojourn under the shelter of the God of heaven.
019	PSA	091	002	He shall say to the Lord, Thou art my helper and my refuge: my God; I will hope in him.
019	PSA	091	003	For he shall deliver thee from the snare of the hunters, from [every] troublesome matter.
019	PSA	091	004	He shall overshadow thee with his shoulders, and thou shalt trust under his wings: his truth shall cover thee with a shield.
019	PSA	091	005	Thou shalt not be afraid of terror by night; nor of the arrow flying by day;
019	PSA	091	006	[nor] of the [evil] thing that walks in darkness; [nor] of calamity, and the evil spirit at noon-day.
019	PSA	091	007	A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee.
019	PSA	091	008	Only with thine eyes shalt thou observe and see the reward of sinners.
019	PSA	091	009	For thou, O Lord, art my hope: thou, my soul, hast made the Most High thy refuge.
019	PSA	091	010	No evils shall come upon thee, and no scourge shall draw nigh to thy dwelling.
019	PSA	091	011	For he shall give his angels charge concerning thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.
019	PSA	091	012	They shall bear thee up on their hands, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.
019	PSA	091	013	Thou shalt tread on the asp and basilisk: and thou shalt trample on the lion and dragon.
019	PSA	091	014	For he has hoped in me, and I will deliver him: I will protect him, because he has known my name.
019	PSA	091	015	He shall call upon me, and I will hearken to him: I am with him in affliction; and I will deliver him, and glorify him.
019	PSA	091	016	I will satisfy him with length of days, and shew him my salvation.
019	PSA	092	001	A Psalm of a Song for the Sabbath-day. It is a good thing to give thanks to the Lord, and to sing praises to thy name, O thou Most High;
019	PSA	092	002	to proclaim thy mercy in the morning, and thy truth by night,
019	PSA	092	003	on a psaltery of ten strings, with a song on the harp.
019	PSA	092	004	For thou, O Lord, hast made me glad with thy work: and in the operations of thy hands will I exult.
019	PSA	092	005	How have thy works been magnified, O Lord! thy thoughts are very deep.
019	PSA	092	006	A foolish man will not know, and a senseless man will not understand this.
019	PSA	092	007	When the sinners spring up as the grass, and all the workers of iniquity have watched; [it is] that they may be utterly destroyed for ever.
019	PSA	092	008	But thou, O Lord, art most high for ever.
019	PSA	092	009	For, behold, thine enemies shall perish; and all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.
019	PSA	092	010	But my horn shall be exalted [as the horn] of a unicorn; and mine old age with rich mercy.
019	PSA	092	011	And mine eye has seen mine enemies, and mine ear shall hear the wicked that rise up against me.
019	PSA	092	012	The righteous shall flourish as a palm-tree: he shall be increased as the cedar in Libanus.
019	PSA	092	013	They that are planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish in the courts of our God.
019	PSA	092	014	Then shall they be increased in a fine old age; and they shall be prosperous; that they may declare
019	PSA	092	015	that the Lord my God is righteous, and there is no iniquity in him.
019	PSA	093	001	For the day before the Sabbath, when the land was [first] inhabited, the praise of a Song by David. The Lord reigns; he has clothed himself with honour: the Lord has clothed and girded himself with strength; for he has established the world, which shall not be moved.
019	PSA	093	002	Thy throne is prepared of old: thou art from everlasting.
019	PSA	093	003	The rivers have lifted up, O Lord, the rivers have lifted up their voices,
019	PSA	093	004	at the voices of many waters: the billows of the sea are wonderful: the Lord is wonderful in high places.
019	PSA	093	005	Thy testimonies are made very sure: holiness becomes thine house, O Lord, for ever.
019	PSA	094	001	A Psalm of David for the fourth [day] of the week. The Lord is a God of vengeance; the God of vengeance has declared himself.
019	PSA	094	002	Be thou exalted, thou that judgest the earth: render a reward to the proud.
019	PSA	094	003	How long shall sinners, O Lord, how long shall sinners boast?
019	PSA	094	004	They will utter and speak unrighteousness; all the workers of iniquity will speak [so].
019	PSA	094	005	They have afflicted thy people, O Lord, and hurt thine heritage.
019	PSA	094	006	They have slain the widow and fatherless, and murdered the stranger.
019	PSA	094	007	And they said, The Lord shall not see, neither shall the God of Jacob understand.
019	PSA	094	008	Understand now, ye simple among the people; and ye fools, at length be wise.
019	PSA	094	009	He that planted the ear, does he not hear? or he that formed the eye, does not he perceive?
019	PSA	094	010	He that chastises the heathen, shall not he punish, [even] he that teaches man knowledge?
019	PSA	094	011	The Lord knows the thoughts of men, that they are vain.
019	PSA	094	012	Blessed is the man whomsoever thou shalt chasten, O Lord, and shalt teach him out of thy law;
019	PSA	094	013	to give him rest from evil days, until a pit be digged for the sinful one.
019	PSA	094	014	For the Lord will not cast off his people, neither will he forsake his inheritance;
019	PSA	094	015	until righteousness return to judgment, and all the upright in heart shall follow it. (Pause)
019	PSA	094	016	Who will rise up for me against the transgressors? or who will stand up with me against the workers of iniquity?
019	PSA	094	017	If the Lord had not helped me, my soul had almost sojourned in Hades.
019	PSA	094	018	If I said, My foot has been moved;
019	PSA	094	019	thy mercy, O Lord, helped me. O Lord, according to the multitude of my griefs within my heart, thy consolation have soothed my soul.
019	PSA	094	020	Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, which frames mischief by an ordinance?
019	PSA	094	021	They will hunt for the soul of the righteous, and condemn innocent blood.
019	PSA	094	022	But the Lord was my refuge; and my God the helper of my hope.
019	PSA	094	023	And he will recompense to them their iniquity and their wickedness: the Lord our God shall utterly destroy them.

019	PSA	095	003	For the Lord is a great God, and a great king over all gods: for the Lord will not cast off his people.
019	PSA	095	004	For the ends of the earth are in his hands; and the heights of the mountains are his.
019	PSA	095	005	For the sea is his, and he made it: and is hands formed the dry land.
019	PSA	095	006	Come, let us worship and fall down before him; and weep before the Lord that made us.
019	PSA	095	007	For he is our God; and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand.
019	PSA	095	008	To-day, if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, according to the day of irritation in the wilderness:
019	PSA	095	009	where your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works.
019	PSA	095	010	Forty years was I grieved with this generation, and said, They do always err in their heart, and they have not known my ways.
019	PSA	095	011	So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.

019	PSA	096	003	Publish his glory among the Gentiles, his wonderful works among all people.
019	PSA	096	004	For the Lord is great, and greatly to be praised: he is terrible above all gods.
019	PSA	096	005	For all the gods of the heathen are devils: but the Lord made the heavens.
019	PSA	096	006	Thanksgiving and beauty are before him: holiness and majesty are in his sanctuary.
019	PSA	096	007	Bring to the Lord, ye families of the Gentiles, bring to the Lord glory and honour.
019	PSA	096	008	Bring to the Lord the glory [becoming] his name: take offerings, and go into his courts.
019	PSA	096	009	Worship the Lord in his holy court: let all the earth tremble before him.
019	PSA	096	010	Say among the heathen, The Lord reigns: for he has established the world so that it shall not be moved: he shall judge the people in righteousness.
019	PSA	096	011	Let the heavens rejoice, and the earth exult; let the sea be moved, and the fullness of it.
019	PSA	096	012	The plains shall rejoice, and all things in them: then shall all the trees of the wood exult before the presence of the Lord:
019	PSA	096	013	for he comes, for he comes to judge the earth; he shall judge the world in righteousness, and the people with his truth.
019	PSA	097	001	For David, when his land is established. The Lord reigns, let the earth exult, let many islands rejoice.
019	PSA	097	002	Cloud, and darkness are round about him; righteousness and judgment are the establishment of his throne.
019	PSA	097	003	Fire shall go before him, and burn up his enemies round about.
019	PSA	097	004	His lightnings appeared to the world; the earth saw, and trembled.
019	PSA	097	005	The mountains melted like wax at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.
019	PSA	097	006	The heavens have declared his righteousness, and all the people have seen his glory.
019	PSA	097	007	Let all that worship graven images be ashamed, who boast of their idols; worship him, all ye his angels.
019	PSA	097	008	Sion heard and rejoiced; and the daughters of Judea exulted, because of thy judgments, O Lord.
019	PSA	097	009	For thou art Lord most high over all the earth; thou art greatly exalted above all gods.
019	PSA	097	010	Ye that love the Lord, hate evil; the Lord preserves the souls of his saints; he shall deliver them from the hand of sinners.
019	PSA	097	011	Light is sprung up for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart.

019	PSA	098	003	He has remembered his mercy to Jacob, and his truth to the house of Israel; all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.

019	PSA	098	005	Sing to the Lord with a harp, with a harp, and the voice of a psalm.
019	PSA	098	006	With trumpets of metal, and the sound of a trumpet of horn make a joyful noise to the Lord before the king.
019	PSA	098	007	Let the sea be moved, and the fullness of it; the world, and they that dwell in it.
019	PSA	098	008	The rivers shall clap their hands together; the mountains shall exult.

019	PSA	099	003	Let them give thanks to thy great name; for it is terrible and holy.

019	PSA	099	005	Exalt ye the Lord our God, and worship [at] his footstool; for he is holy.
019	PSA	099	006	Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among them that call upon his name; they called upon the Lord, and he heard them.
019	PSA	099	007	He spoke to them in a pillar of cloud; they kept his testimonies, and the ordinances which he gave them.
019	PSA	099	008	O Lord our God, thou heardest them; O God, thou becamest propitious to them, though thou didst take vengeance on all their devices.
019	PSA	099	009	Exalt ye the Lord our God, and worship at his holy mountain; for the Lord our God is holy.

019	PSA	100	002	Serve the Lord with gladness; come before his presence with exultation.
019	PSA	100	003	Know that the Lord he is God; he made us, and not we ourselves; [we are] his people, and the sheep of his pasture.
019	PSA	100	004	Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and his courts with hymns; give thanks to him, praise his name.
019	PSA	100	005	For the Lord is good, his mercy is for ever; and his truth [endures] to generation and generation.
019	PSA	101	001	A Psalm of David. I will sing to thee, O Lord, of mercy and judgment; I will sing a psalm,
019	PSA	101	002	and I will be wise in a blameless way. When wilt thou come to me? I walked in the innocence of my heart, in the midst of my house.
019	PSA	101	003	I have not set before mine eyes any unlawful ting; I have hated transgressors.
019	PSA	101	004	A perverse heart has not cleaved to me; I have not known an evil man, forasmuch as he turns away from me.
019	PSA	101	005	Him that privily speaks against his neighbour, him have I driven from [me]: he that is proud in look and insatiable in heart, —with him I have not eaten.
019	PSA	101	006	Mine eyes [shall be] upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me: he that walked in a perfect way, the same ministered to me.
019	PSA	101	007	The proud doer dwelt not in the midst of my house; the unjust speaker prospered not in my sight.
019	PSA	101	008	Early did I slay all the sinners of the land, that I might destroy out of the city of the Lord all that work iniquity.
019	PSA	102	001	A Prayer for the Poor; when he is deeply afflicted, and pours out his supplication before the Lord. Hear my prayer, O Lord, and let my cry come to thee.
019	PSA	102	002	Turn not away thy face from me: in the day [when] I am afflicted, incline thine ear to me: in the day [when] I shall call upon thee, speedily hear me.
019	PSA	102	003	For my days have vanished like smoke, and my bones have been parched like a stick.
019	PSA	102	004	I am blighted like grass, and my heart is dried up; for I have forgotten to eat my bread.
019	PSA	102	005	By reason of the voice of my groaning, my bone has cleaved to my flesh.
019	PSA	102	006	I have become like a pelican of the wilderness;
019	PSA	102	007	I have become like an owl in a ruined house. I have watched, and am become as a sparrow dwelling alone on a roof.
019	PSA	102	008	All the day long mine enemies have reproached me; and they that praised me have sworn against me.
019	PSA	102	009	For I have eaten ashes as it were bread, and mingled my drink with weeping;
019	PSA	102	010	because of thine anger and thy wrath: for thou hast lifted me up, and dashed me down.
019	PSA	102	011	My days have declined like a shadow; and I am withered like grass.
019	PSA	102	012	But thou, Lord, endurest for ever, and thy memorial to generation and generation.
019	PSA	102	013	Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Sion: for [it is] time to have mercy upon her, for the set time is come.
019	PSA	102	014	For thy servants have taken pleasure in her stones, and they shall pity her dust.
019	PSA	102	015	So the nations shall fear thy name, O Lord, and all kings thy glory.
019	PSA	102	016	For the Lord shall build up Sion, and shall appear in his glory.
019	PSA	102	017	He has had regard to the prayer of the lowly, and has not despised their petition.
019	PSA	102	018	Let this be written for another generation; and the people that shall be created shall praise the Lord.
019	PSA	102	019	For he has looked out from the height of his sanctuary; the Lord looked upon the earth from heaven;
019	PSA	102	020	to hear the groaning of the fettered ones, to loosen the sons of the slain;
019	PSA	102	021	to proclaim the name of the Lord in Sion, and his praise in Jerusalem;
019	PSA	102	022	when the people are gathered together, and the kings, to serve the Lord.
019	PSA	102	023	He answered him in the way of his strength: tell me the fewness of my days.
019	PSA	102	024	Take me not away in the midst of my days: thy years [are] through all generations.
019	PSA	102	025	In the beginning thou, O Lord, didst lay the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of thine hands.
019	PSA	102	026	They shall perish, but thou remainest: and [they all] shall wax old as a garment; and as a vesture shalt thou fold them, and they shall be changed.
019	PSA	102	027	But thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.
019	PSA	102	028	The children of thy servants shall dwell [securely], and their seed shall prosper for ever.
019	PSA	103	001	[A Psalm] of David. Bless the Lord, O my soul; and all [that is] within me, [bless] his holy name.
019	PSA	103	002	Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his praises:
019	PSA	103	003	who forgives all thy transgressions, who heals all thy diseases;
019	PSA	103	004	who redeems thy life from corruption; who crowns thee with mercy and compassion;
019	PSA	103	005	who satisfies thy desire with good things: [so that] thy youth shall be renewed like [that] of the eagle.
019	PSA	103	006	The Lord executes mercy and judgment for all that are injured.
019	PSA	103	007	He made known his ways to Moses, his will to the children of Israel.
019	PSA	103	008	The Lord is compassionate and pitiful, long-suffering, and full of mercy.
019	PSA	103	009	He will not be always angry; neither will he be wrathful for ever.
019	PSA	103	010	He has not dealt with us according to our sins, nor recompensed us according to our iniquities.
019	PSA	103	011	For as the heaven is high above the earth, the Lord has [so] increased his mercy toward them that fear him.
019	PSA	103	012	As far as the east is from the west, [so far] has he removed our transgressions from us.
019	PSA	103	013	As a father pities [his] children, the Lord pities them that fear him.
019	PSA	103	014	For he knows our frame: remember that we are dust.
019	PSA	103	015	[As for] man, his days are as grass; as a flower of the field, so shall he flourish.
019	PSA	103	016	For the wind passes over it, and it shall not be; and it shall know its place no more.
019	PSA	103	017	But the mercy of the Lord is from generation to generation upon them that fear him, and his righteousness to children's children;
019	PSA	103	018	to them that keep his covenant, and remember his commandments to do them.
019	PSA	103	019	The Lord has prepared his throne in the heaven; and his kingdom rules over all.
019	PSA	103	020	Bless the Lord, all ye his angels, mighty in strength, who perform his bidding, [ready] to hearken to the voice of his words.
019	PSA	103	021	Bless the Lord, all ye his hosts; [ye] ministers of his that do his will.
019	PSA	103	022	Bless the Lord, all his works, in every place of his dominion: bless the Lord, O my soul.
019	PSA	104	001	[A Psalm] of David. Bless the Lord, O my soul. O Lord my God, thou art very great; thou hast clothed thyself with praise and honour:
019	PSA	104	002	who dost robe thyself with light as with a garment; spreading out the heaven as a curtain.
019	PSA	104	003	Who covers his chambers with waters; who makes the clouds his chariot; who walks on the wings of the wind.
019	PSA	104	004	Who makes his angels spirits, and his ministers a flaming fire.
019	PSA	104	005	Who establishes the earth on her sure foundation: it shall not be moved for ever.
019	PSA	104	006	The deep, as it were a garment, is his covering: the waters shall stand on the hills.
019	PSA	104	007	At thy rebuke they shall flee; at the voice of thy thunder they shall be alarmed.
019	PSA	104	008	They go up to the mountains, and down to the plains, to the place which thou hast founded for them.
019	PSA	104	009	Thou hast set a bound which they shall not pass, neither shall they turn again to cover the earth.
019	PSA	104	010	He sends forth his fountains among the valleys: the waters shall run between the mountains.
019	PSA	104	011	They shall give drink to all the wild beasts of the field: the wild asses shall take [of them] to [quench] their thirst.
019	PSA	104	012	By them shall the birds of the sky lodge: they shall utter a voice out of the midst of the rocks.
019	PSA	104	013	He waters the mountains from his chambers: the earth shall be satisfied with the fruit of thy works.
019	PSA	104	014	He makes grass to grow for the cattle, and green herb for the service of men, to bring bread out of the earth;
019	PSA	104	015	and wine makes glad the heart of man, to make his face cheerful with oil: and bread strengthens man's heart.
019	PSA	104	016	The trees of the plain shall be full [of sap]; [even] the cedars of Libanus which he has planted.
019	PSA	104	017	There the sparrows will build their nests; and the house of the heron takes the lead among them.
019	PSA	104	018	The high mountains are a refuge for the stags, [and] the rock for the rabbits.
019	PSA	104	019	He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knows his going down.
019	PSA	104	020	Thou didst make darkness, and it was night; in it all the wild beasts of the forest will be abroad:
019	PSA	104	021	[even] young lions roaring for prey, and to seek meat for themselves from God.
019	PSA	104	022	The sun arises, and they shall be gathered together, and shall lie down in their dens.
019	PSA	104	023	Man shall go forth to his work, and to his labour till evening.
019	PSA	104	024	How great are thy works, O Lord! in wisdom hast thou wrought them all: the earth is filled with thy creation.
019	PSA	104	025	[So is] this great and wide sea: there are things creeping innumerable, small animals and great.
019	PSA	104	026	There go the ships; [and] this dragon whom thou hast made to play in it.
019	PSA	104	027	All wait upon thee, to give them [their] food in due season.
019	PSA	104	028	When thou hast given [it] them, they will gather [it]; and when thou hast opened thine hand, they shall all be filled with good.
019	PSA	104	029	But when thou hast turned away thy face, they shall be troubled: thou wilt take away their breath, and they shall fail, and return to their dust.
019	PSA	104	030	Thou shalt send forth thy Spirit, and they shall be created; and thou shalt renew the face of the earth.
019	PSA	104	031	Let the glory of the Lord be for ever: the Lord shall rejoice in his works;
019	PSA	104	032	who looks upon the earth, and makes it tremble; who touches the mountains, and they smoke.
019	PSA	104	033	I will sing to the Lord while I live; I will sing praise to my God while I exist.
019	PSA	104	034	Let my meditation be sweet to him: and I will rejoice in the Lord.
019	PSA	104	035	Let the sinners fail from off the earth, and transgressors, so that they shall be no more. Bless the Lord, O my soul.
019	PSA	105	001	Alleluia. Give thanks to the Lord, and call upon his name; declare his works among the heathen.
019	PSA	105	002	Sing to him, yea, sing praises to him: tell forth all his wonderful works.
019	PSA	105	003	Glory in his holy name: let the heart of them that seek the Lord rejoice.
019	PSA	105	004	Seek ye the Lord, and be strengthened; seek his face continually.
019	PSA	105	005	Remember his wonderful works that he has done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;
019	PSA	105	006	[ye] seed of Abraam, his servants, [ye] children of Jacob, his chosen ones.
019	PSA	105	007	He is the Lord our God; his judgments are in all the earth.
019	PSA	105	008	He has remembered his covenant for ever, the word which he commanded for a thousand generation:
019	PSA	105	009	which he established as a covenant to Abraam, and [he remembered] his oath to Isaac.
019	PSA	105	010	And he established it to Jacob for an ordinance, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant;
019	PSA	105	011	saying To thee will I give the land of Chanaan, the line of your inheritance:
019	PSA	105	012	when they were few in number, very few, and sojourners in it.
019	PSA	105	013	And they went from nation to nation, and from [one] kingdom to another people.
019	PSA	105	014	He suffered no man to wrong them; and he rebuked kings for their sakes:
019	PSA	105	015	[saying], Touch not my anointed ones; and do my prophets no harm.
019	PSA	105	016	Moreover he called for a famine upon the land; he broke the whole support of bread.
019	PSA	105	017	He sent a man before them; Joseph was sold for a slave.
019	PSA	105	018	They hurt his feet with fetters; his soul passed into iron,
019	PSA	105	019	until the time that his cause came on; the word of the Lord tried him as fire.
019	PSA	105	020	The king sent and loosed him; [even] the prince of the people, and let him go free.
019	PSA	105	021	He made him Lord over his house, and ruler of all his substance;
019	PSA	105	022	to chastise his rulers at his pleasure, and to teach his elders wisdom.
019	PSA	105	023	Israel also came into Egypt, and Jacob sojourned in the land of Cham.
019	PSA	105	024	And he increased his people greatly, and made them stronger than their enemies.
019	PSA	105	025	And he turned their heart to hate his people, to deal craftily with his servants.
019	PSA	105	026	He sent fort Moses his servant, [and] Aaron whom he had chosen.
019	PSA	105	027	He established among them his signs, and [his] wonders in the land of Cham.
019	PSA	105	028	He sent forth darkness, and made it dark; yet they rebelled against his words.
019	PSA	105	029	He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish.
019	PSA	105	030	Their land produced frogs abundantly, in the chambers of their kings.
019	PSA	105	031	He spoke, and the dog-fly came, and lice in all their coasts.
019	PSA	105	032	He turned their rain into hail, [and sent] flaming fire in their land.
019	PSA	105	033	And he smote their vines and their fig trees; and broke every tree of their coast.
019	PSA	105	034	He spoke, and the locust came, and caterpillars innumerable,
019	PSA	105	035	and devoured all the grass in their land, and devoured the fruit of the ground.
019	PSA	105	036	He smote also every first-born of their land, the first-fruits of all their labour.
019	PSA	105	037	And he brought them out with silver and gold; and there was not a feeble one among their tribes.
019	PSA	105	038	Egypt rejoiced at their departing; for the fear of them fell upon them.
019	PSA	105	039	He spread out a cloud for a covering to them, and fire to give them light by night.
019	PSA	105	040	They asked, and the quail came, and he satisfied them with the bread of heaven.
019	PSA	105	041	He clave the rock, and the waters flowed, rivers ran in dry places.
019	PSA	105	042	For he remembered his holy word, which [he promised] to Abraam his servant.
019	PSA	105	043	And he brought out his people with exultation, and his chosen with joy;
019	PSA	105	044	and gave them the lands of the heathen; and they inherited the labours of the people;
019	PSA	105	045	that they might keep his ordinances, and diligently seek his law.
019	PSA	106	001	Alleluia. Give thanks to the Lord; for he is good: for his mercy [endures] for ever.
019	PSA	106	002	Who shall tell the mighty acts of the Lord? [who] shall cause all his praises to be heard?
019	PSA	106	003	Blessed are they that keep judgment, and do righteousness at all times.
019	PSA	106	004	Remember us, O Lord, with the favour [thou hast] to thy people: visit us with thy salvation;
019	PSA	106	005	that we may behold the good of thine elect, that we may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that we may glory with thine inheritance.
019	PSA	106	006	We have sinned with our fathers, we have transgressed, we have done unrighteously.
019	PSA	106	007	Our fathers in Egypt understood not thy wonders, and remembered not the multitude of thy mercy; but provoked [him] as they went up by the Red Sea.
019	PSA	106	008	Yet he saved them for his name's sake, that he might cause his mighty power to be known.
019	PSA	106	009	And he rebuked the Red Sea, and it was dried up: so he led them through the deep as through the wilderness.
019	PSA	106	010	And he saved them out of the hand of them that hated [them], and redeemed them out of the hand of the enemy.
019	PSA	106	011	The water covered those that oppressed them: there was not one of them left.
019	PSA	106	012	Then they believed his words, and celebrated his praise.
019	PSA	106	013	They made haste, they forgot his works; they waited not for his counsel.
019	PSA	106	014	And they lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the dry [land].
019	PSA	106	015	And he gave them their request, and sent fullness into their souls.
019	PSA	106	016	They provoked Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the holy one of the Lord.
019	PSA	106	017	The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and closed upon the congregation of Abiron.
019	PSA	106	018	And a fire was kindled in their congregation, and a flame burnt up the sinners.
019	PSA	106	019	And they made a calf in Choreb, and worshipped the graven image,
019	PSA	106	020	and they changed their glory into the similitude of a calf that feeds on grass.
019	PSA	106	021	They forgot God that saved them, who had wrought great deeds in Egypt;
019	PSA	106	022	wondrous [works] in the land of Cham, and terrible things at the Red Sea.
019	PSA	106	023	So he said that he would have destroyed them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn [him] away from the fierceness of his anger, so that he should not destroy them.
019	PSA	106	024	Moreover they set at nought the desirable land, and believed not his word.
019	PSA	106	025	And they murmured in their tents: they hearkened not to the voice of the Lord.
019	PSA	106	026	So he lifted up his hand against them, to cast them down in the wilderness;
019	PSA	106	027	and to cast down their seed among the nations, and to scatter them in the countries.
019	PSA	106	028	They were joined also to Beelphegor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead. And they provoked him with their devices;
019	PSA	106	029	and destruction, was multiplied among them.
019	PSA	106	030	Then Phinees stood up, and made atonement: and the plague ceased.
019	PSA	106	031	And it was counted to him for righteousness, to all generations for ever.
019	PSA	106	032	They provoked him also at the water of Strife, and Moses was hurt for their sakes;
019	PSA	106	033	for they provoked his spirit, and he spoke [unadvisedly] with his lips.
019	PSA	106	034	They destroyed not the nations which the Lord told them [to destroy];
019	PSA	106	035	but were mingled with the heathen, and learned their works.
019	PSA	106	036	And they served their graven images; and it became an offence to them.
019	PSA	106	037	And they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to devils,
019	PSA	106	038	and shed innocent blood, the blood of their sons and daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Chanaan; and the land was defiled with blood.
019	PSA	106	039	and was polluted with their works; and they went a whoring with their own devices.
019	PSA	106	040	So the Lord was very angry with his people, and he abhorred his inheritance.
019	PSA	106	041	And he delivered them into the hands of [their] enemies; and they that hated them ruled over them.
019	PSA	106	042	Ands their enemies oppressed them, and they were brought down under their hands.
019	PSA	106	043	Many a time he delivered them; but they provoked him by their counsel, and they were brought low by their iniquities.
019	PSA	106	044	Ye the Lord looked upon their affliction, when he heard their petition.
019	PSA	106	045	And he remembered his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercy.
019	PSA	106	046	And he caused them to be pitied in the sight of all who carried them captive.
019	PSA	106	047	Save us, O Lord our God, and gather us from among the heathen, that we may give thanks to thy holy name, that we may glory in thy praise.
019	PSA	106	048	Blessed be the Lord God of Israel from everlasting and to everlasting; and all the people shall say, Amen, Amen.
019	PSA	107	001	Alleluia. Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good; for his mercy [endures] for ever.
019	PSA	107	002	Let them say [so] who have been redeemed by the Lord, whom he has redeemed from the hand of the enemy;
019	PSA	107	003	and gathered them out of the countries, from the east, and west, and north, and south.
019	PSA	107	004	They wandered in the wilderness in a dry land; they found no way to a city of habitation.
019	PSA	107	005	Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.
019	PSA	107	006	Then they cried to the Lord in their affliction, and he delivered them out of their distresses.
019	PSA	107	007	And he guided them into a straight path, that they might go to a city of habitation.
019	PSA	107	008	Let them acknowledge to the Lord his mercies, and his wonderful works to the children of men.
019	PSA	107	009	For he satisfies the empty soul, and fills the hungry [soul] with good things,
019	PSA	107	010	[even] them that sit in darkness and the shadow of death, fettered in poverty and iron;
019	PSA	107	011	because they rebelled against the words of God, and provoked the counsel of the Most High.
019	PSA	107	012	So their heart was brought low with troubles; they were weak, and there was no helper.
019	PSA	107	013	Then they cried to the Lord in their affliction, and he saved them out of their distresses.
019	PSA	107	014	And he brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and broke their bonds asunder.
019	PSA	107	015	Let them acknowledge to the Lord his mercies, and his wonders to the children of men.
019	PSA	107	016	For he broke to pieces the brazen gates, and crushed the iron bars.
019	PSA	107	017	He helped them out of the way of their iniquity; for they were brought low because of their iniquities.
019	PSA	107	018	Their soul abhorred all meat; and they drew near to the gates of death.
019	PSA	107	019	Then they cried to the Lord in their affliction, and he saved them out of their distresses.
019	PSA	107	020	He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them out of their destructions.
019	PSA	107	021	Let them acknowledge to the Lord his mercies, and his wonderful works to the children of men.
019	PSA	107	022	And let them offer to him the sacrifice of praise, and proclaim this works with exultation.
019	PSA	107	023	They that go down to the sea in ships, doing business in many waters;
019	PSA	107	024	these [men] have seen the works of the Lord, and his wonders in the deep.
019	PSA	107	025	He speaks, and the stormy wind arises, and its waves are lifted up.
019	PSA	107	026	They go up to the heavens, and go down to the depths; their soul melts because of troubles.
019	PSA	107	027	They are troubled, they stagger as a drunkard, and all their wisdom is swallowed up.
019	PSA	107	028	Then they cry to the Lord in their affliction, and he brings them out of their distresses.
019	PSA	107	029	And he commands the storm, and it is calmed into a gentle breeze, and its waves are still.
019	PSA	107	030	And they are glad, because they are quiet; and he guides them to their desire haven.
019	PSA	107	031	Let them acknowledge to the Lord his mercies, and his wonderful works to the children of men.
019	PSA	107	032	Let them exalt him in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the seat of the elders.
019	PSA	107	033	He turns rivers into a desert, and streams of water into a dry land;
019	PSA	107	034	a fruitful land into saltness, for the wickedness of them that dwell in it.
019	PSA	107	035	He turns a wilderness into pools of water, and a dry land into streams of water.
019	PSA	107	036	And there he causes the hungry to dwell, and they establish for themselves cities of habitation.
019	PSA	107	037	And they sow fields, and plant vineyards, and they yield fruit of increase.
019	PSA	107	038	And he blesses them, and they multiply exceedingly, and he diminishes not the number of their cattle.
019	PSA	107	039	Again they become few, and are brought low, by the pressure of evils and pain.
019	PSA	107	040	Contempt is poured upon their princes, and he causes them to wander in a desert and trackless land.
019	PSA	107	041	But he helps the poor out of poverty, and makes [him] families as a flock.
019	PSA	107	042	The upright shall see and rejoice; and all iniquity shall stop her mouth.
019	PSA	107	043	Who is wise, and will observe these things, and understand the mercies of the Lord?
019	PSA	108	001	Song of a Psalm by David. O God, my heart is ready, my heart is ready; I will sing and sing psalms with my glory.
019	PSA	108	002	Awake, psaltery and harp; I will awake early.
019	PSA	108	003	I will give thanks to thee, O Lord, among the people; I will sing praise to thee among the Gentiles.
019	PSA	108	004	For thy mercy is great above the heavens, and thy truth [reaches] to the clouds.
019	PSA	108	005	Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; and thy glory above all the earth.
019	PSA	108	006	That thy beloved [ones] may be delivered, save with thy right hand, and hear me. God has spoken in his sanctuary;
019	PSA	108	007	I will be exalted, and will divide Sicima, and will measure out the valley of tents.
019	PSA	108	008	Galaad is mine; and Manasses is mine; and Ephraim is the help of mine head; Judas is my king;
019	PSA	108	009	Moab is the caldron of my hope; over Idumea will I cast my sandal; the Philistines are made subject to me.
019	PSA	108	010	Who will bring me into the fortified city? or who will guide me to Idumea?
019	PSA	108	011	Wilt not thou, O God, who hast rejected us? and wilt not thou, O God, go forth with our hosts?
019	PSA	108	012	Give us help from tribulation: for vain is the help of man.
019	PSA	108	013	Through God we shall do valiantly; and he will bring to nought our enemies.
019	PSA	109	001	For the end, a Psalm of David. For the end, a Psalm of David. O God, pass not over my praise in silence;
019	PSA	109	002	for the mouth of the sinner and the mouth of the crafty [man] have been opened against me: they have spoken against me with a crafty tongue.
019	PSA	109	003	And they have compassed me with words of hatred; and fought against me without a cause.
019	PSA	109	004	Instead of loving me, they falsely accused me: but I continued to pray.
019	PSA	109	005	And they rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love.
019	PSA	109	006	Set thou a sinner against him; and let the devil stand at his right hand.
019	PSA	109	007	When he is judged, let him go forth condemned: and let his prayer become sin.
019	PSA	109	008	Let his days be few: and let another take his office of overseer.
019	PSA	109	009	Let his children be orphans, and his wife a widow.
019	PSA	109	010	Let his children wander without a dwelling-place, and beg: let them be cast out of their habitations.
019	PSA	109	011	Let [his] creditor exact all that belongs to him: and let strangers spoil his labours.
019	PSA	109	012	Let him have no helper; neither let there be any one to have compassion on his fatherless children.
019	PSA	109	013	Let his children be [given up] to utter destruction: in one generation let his name be blotted out.
019	PSA	109	014	Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered before the Lord; and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.
019	PSA	109	015	Let them be before the Lord continually; and let their memorial be blotted out from the earth.
019	PSA	109	016	Because he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted the needy and poor man, and [that] to slay him that was pricked in the heart.
019	PSA	109	017	He loved cursing also, and it shall come upon him; and he took not pleasure in blessing, so it shall be removed far from him.
019	PSA	109	018	Yea, he put on cursing as a garment, and it is come as water into his bowels, and as oil into his bones.
019	PSA	109	019	Let it be to him as a garment which he puts on, and as a girdle with which he girds himself continually.
019	PSA	109	020	This is the dealing of the Lord with those who falsely accuse me, and of them that speak evil against my soul.
019	PSA	109	021	But thou, O Lord, Lord, deal [mercifully] with me, for thy name's sake: for thy mercy is good.
019	PSA	109	022	Deliver me, for I am poor and needy; and my heart is troubled within me.
019	PSA	109	023	I am removed as a shadow in its going down: I am tossed up and down like locusts.
019	PSA	109	024	My knees are weakened through fasting, and my flesh is changed by reason of [the want of] oil.
019	PSA	109	025	I became also a reproach to them: [when] they saw me they shook their heads.
019	PSA	109	026	Help me, O Lord my God; and save me according to thy mercy.
019	PSA	109	027	And let them know that this is thy hand; and [that] thou, Lord, hast wrought it.
019	PSA	109	028	Let them curse, but thou shalt bless: let them that rise up against me be ashamed, but let thy servant rejoice.
019	PSA	109	029	Let those that falsely accuse me be clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their shame as with a mantle.
019	PSA	109	030	I will give thanks to the Lord abundantly with my mouth; and in the midst of many I will praise him.
019	PSA	109	031	For he stood on the right hand of the poor, to save [me] from them that persecute my soul.
019	PSA	110	001	A Psalm of David. The Lord said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.
019	PSA	110	002	The Lord shall send out a rod of power for thee out of Sion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.
019	PSA	110	003	With thee is dominion in the day of thy power, in the splendours of thy saints: I have begotten thee from the womb before the morning.
019	PSA	110	004	The Lord sware, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever, after the order of Melchisedec.
019	PSA	110	005	The Lord at thy right hand has dashed in pieces kings in the day of his wrath.
019	PSA	110	006	He shall judge among the nations, he shall fill up [the number of] corpses, he shall crush the heads of many on the earth.
019	PSA	110	007	He shall drink of the brook in the way; therefore shall he lift up the head.
019	PSA	111	001	Alleluia. I will give thee thanks, O Lord, with my whole heart, in the council of the upright, and [in] the congregation.
019	PSA	111	002	The works of the Lord are great, sought out according to all his will.
019	PSA	111	003	His work is [worthy of] thanksgiving and honour: and his righteousness endures for ever and ever.
019	PSA	111	004	He has caused his wonderful works to be remembered: the Lord is merciful and compassionate.
019	PSA	111	005	He has given food to them that fear him: he will remember his covenant for ever.
019	PSA	111	006	He has declared to his people the power of his works, to give them the inheritance of the heathen.
019	PSA	111	007	The works of his hands are truth and judgment: all his commandments are sure:
019	PSA	111	008	established for ever and ever, done in truth and uprightness.
019	PSA	111	009	He sent redemption to his people: he commanded his covenant for ever: holy and fearful is his name.
019	PSA	111	010	The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and all that act accordingly have a good understanding; his praise endures for ever and ever.
019	PSA	112	001	Alleluia. Blessed is the man that fears the Lord: he will delight greatly in his commandments.
019	PSA	112	002	His seed shall be mighty in the earth: the generation of the upright shall be blessed.
019	PSA	112	003	Glory and riches shall be in his house; and his righteousness endures for evermore.
019	PSA	112	004	To the upright light has sprung up in darkness: he is pitiful, and merciful, and righteous.
019	PSA	112	005	The good man is he that pities and lends: he will direct his affairs with judgment.
019	PSA	112	006	For he shall not be moved for ever; the righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance.
019	PSA	112	007	He shall not be afraid of [any] evil report: his heart is ready to trust in the Lord.
019	PSA	112	008	His heart is established, he shall not fear, till he shall see [his desire] upon his enemies.
019	PSA	112	009	He has dispersed abroad; he has given to the poor; his righteousness endures for evermore: his horn shall be exalted with honour.
019	PSA	112	010	The sinner shall see and be angry, he shall gnash his teeth, and consume away: the desire of the sinner shall perish.

019	PSA	113	005	Who is as the Lord our God? who dwells in the high places,
019	PSA	113	006	and [yet] looks upon the low things in heaven, and on the earth:
019	PSA	113	007	who lifts up the poor from the earth, and raises up the needy from the dunghill;
019	PSA	113	008	to set him with princes, [even] with the princes of his people:
019	PSA	113	009	who settles the barren [woman] in a house, [as] a mother rejoicing over children.
019	PSA	114	001	Alleluia. At the going forth of Israel from Egypt, of the house of Jacob from a barbarous people,
019	PSA	114	002	Judea became his sanctuary, [and] Israel his dominion.
019	PSA	114	003	The sea saw and fled: Jordan was turned back.
019	PSA	114	004	The mountains skipped like rams, and the hills like lambs.
019	PSA	114	005	What [ailed] thee, O sea, that thou fleddest? and thou Jordan, that thou wast turned back?
019	PSA	114	006	[Ye] mountains, that ye skipped like rams, and [ye] hills, like lambs?
019	PSA	114	007	The earth trembled at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob;
019	PSA	114	008	who turned the rock into pools of water, and the flint into fountains of water.
019	PSA	115	001	Not to us, O Lord, not to us, but to thy name give glory, because of thy mercy and thy truth;
019	PSA	115	002	lest at any time the nations should say, Where is their God?
019	PSA	115	003	But our God has done in heaven and on earth, whatsoever he has pleased.
019	PSA	115	004	The idols of the nations are silver and gold, the works of men's hands.
019	PSA	115	005	They have a mouth, but they cannot speak; they have eyes, but they cannot see:
019	PSA	115	006	they have ears, but they cannot hear; they have noses, but they cannot smell;
019	PSA	115	007	they have hands, but they cannot handle; they have feet, but they cannot walk: they cannot speak through their throat.
019	PSA	115	008	Let those that make them become like to them, and all who trust in them.

019	PSA	115	014	The Lord add [blessings] to you and to your children.
019	PSA	115	015	Blessed are ye of the Lord, who made the heaven and the earth.
019	PSA	115	016	The heaven of heavens [belongs] to the Lord: but he has given the earth to the sons of men.
019	PSA	115	017	The dead shall not praise thee, O Lord, nor any that go down to Hades.
019	PSA	115	018	But we, the living, will bless the Lord, from henceforth and for ever.
019	PSA	116	001	Alleluia. I am well pleased, because the Lord will hearken to the voice of my supplication.
019	PSA	116	002	Because he has inclined his ear to me, therefore will I call upon him while I live.
019	PSA	116	003	The pangs of death compassed me; the dangers of hell found me: I found affliction and sorrow.
019	PSA	116	004	Then I called on the name of the Lord: O Lord, deliver my soul.
019	PSA	116	005	The Lord is merciful and righteous; yea, our God has pity.
019	PSA	116	006	The Lord preserves the simple: I was brought low, and he delivered me.
019	PSA	116	007	Return to thy rest, O my soul; for the Lord has dealt bountifully with thee.
019	PSA	116	008	For he has delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling.
019	PSA	116	009	I shall be well-pleasing before the Lord in the land of the living.
019	PSA	116	010	Alleluia. I believed, wherefore I have spoken: but I was greatly afflicted.

019	PSA	116	012	What shall I render to the Lord for all the things wherein he has rewarded me?
019	PSA	116	013	I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the Lord.
019	PSA	116	014	I will pay my vows to the Lord, in the presence of all his people.
019	PSA	116	015	Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints.
019	PSA	116	016	O Lord, I am thy servant; I am thy servant, and the son of thine handmaid: thou hast burst by bonds asunder.

019	PSA	123	002	Behold, as the eyes of servants [are directed] to the hands of their masters, [and] as the eyes of a maidservant to the hands of her mistress; so our eyes [are directed] to the Lord our God, until he have mercy upon us.
019	PSA	123	003	Have pity upon us, O Lord, have pity upon us: for we are exceedingly filled with contempt.
019	PSA	123	004	[Yea], our soul has been exceedingly filled [with it]: [let] the reproach [be] to them that are at ease, and contempt to the proud.
019	PSA	124	001	A Song of Degrees. If it had not been that the Lord was among us, let Israel now say;
019	PSA	124	002	if it had not been that the Lord was among us, when men rose up against us;
019	PSA	124	003	verily they would have swallowed us up alive, when their wrath was kindled against us:
019	PSA	124	004	verily the water would have drowned us, our soul would have gone under the torrent.
019	PSA	124	005	Yea, our soul would have gone under the overwhelming water.
019	PSA	124	006	Blessed be the Lord, who has not given us for a prey to their teeth.
019	PSA	124	007	Our soul has been delivered as a sparrow from the snare of the fowlers: the snare is broken, and we are delivered.
019	PSA	124	008	Our help is in the name of the Lord, who made heaven and earth.
019	PSA	125	001	A Song of Degrees. They that trust in the Lord [shall be] as mount Sion: he that dwells in Jerusalem shall never be moved.
019	PSA	125	002	The mountains are round about her, and [so] the Lord is round about his people, from henceforth and even for ever.
019	PSA	125	003	For the Lord will not allow the rod of sinners to be upon the lot of the righteous; lest the righteous should stretch forth their hands to iniquity.
019	PSA	125	004	Do good, O Lord, to them [that are] good, and to them [that are] upright in heart.
019	PSA	125	005	But them that turn aside to crooked ways the Lord will lead away with the workers of iniquity: [but] peace [shall be] upon Israel.
019	PSA	126	001	A Song of Degrees. When the Lord turned the captivity of Sion, we became as comforted ones.
019	PSA	126	002	Then was our mouth filled with joy, and our tongue with exultation: then would they say among the Gentiles,
019	PSA	126	003	The Lord has done great things among them. The Lord has done great things for us, we became joyful.
019	PSA	126	004	Turn, O Lord, our captivity, as the steams in the south.
019	PSA	126	005	They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.
019	PSA	126	006	They went on and wept as they cast their seeds; but they shall surely come with exultation, bringing their sheaves [with them].
019	PSA	127	001	A Song of Degrees. Except the Lord build the house, they that build labour in vain: except the Lord keep the city, the watchman watches in vain.
019	PSA	127	002	It is vain for you to rise early: ye rise up after resting, ye that eat the bread of grief; while he gives sleep to his beloved.
019	PSA	127	003	Behold, the inheritance of the Lord, children, the reward of the fruit of the womb.
019	PSA	127	004	As arrows in the hand of a mighty man; so are the children of those who were outcasts.
019	PSA	127	005	Blessed is the man who shall satisfy his desire with them: they shall not be ashamed when they shall speak to their enemies in the gates.
019	PSA	128	001	A Song of Degrees. Blessed are all they that fear the Lord; who walk in his ways.
019	PSA	128	002	Thou shalt eat the labours of thy hands: blessed art thou, and it shall be well with thee.
019	PSA	128	003	Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine on the sides of thy house: thy children as young olive-plants round about thy table.
019	PSA	128	004	Behold, thus shall the man be blessed that fears the Lord.
019	PSA	128	005	May the Lord bless thee out of Sion; and mayest thou see the prosperity of Jerusalem all the days of thy life.
019	PSA	128	006	And mayest thou see thy children's children. Peace be upon Israel.
019	PSA	129	001	A Song of Degrees. Many a time have they warred against me from my youth, let Israel now say:
019	PSA	129	002	Many a time have they warred against me from my youth: and yet they prevailed not against me.
019	PSA	129	003	The sinners wrought upon my back: they prolonged their iniquity.
019	PSA	129	004	The righteous Lord has cut asunder the necks of sinners.
019	PSA	129	005	Let all that hate Sion be put to shame and turned back.
019	PSA	129	006	Let them be as the grass of the house-tops, which withers before it is plucked up.
019	PSA	129	007	Wherewith the reaper fills not his hand, nor he that makes up the sheaves, his bosom.
019	PSA	129	008	Neither do they that go by say, The blessing of the Lord be upon you: we have blessed you in the name of the Lord.
019	PSA	130	001	A Song of Degrees. Out of the depths have I cried to thee, O Lord.
019	PSA	130	002	O Lord, hearken to my voice; let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplication.
019	PSA	130	003	If thou, O Lord, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?
019	PSA	130	004	For with thee is forgiveness: for thy name's sake
019	PSA	130	005	have I waited for thee, O Lord, my soul has waited for thy word.
019	PSA	130	006	My soul has hoped in the Lord; from the morning watch till night.
019	PSA	130	007	Let Israel hope in the Lord: for with the Lord is mercy, and with him is plenteous redemption.
019	PSA	130	008	And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities.
019	PSA	131	001	A Song of Degrees. O Lord, my heart is not exalted, neither have mine eyes been [haughtily] raised: neither have I exercised myself in great [matters], nor in things too wonderful for me.
019	PSA	131	002	[I shall have sinned] if I have not been humble, but have exulted my soul: according to [the relation of] a weaned child to his mother, so wilt thou recompense my soul.
019	PSA	131	003	Let Israel hope in the Lord, from henceforth and for ever.
019	PSA	132	001	A Song of Degrees. Lord, remember David, and all his meekness:
019	PSA	132	002	how he sware to the Lord, [and] vowed to the God of Jacob, [saying],
019	PSA	132	003	I will not go into the tabernacle of my house; I will not go up to the couch of my bed;
019	PSA	132	004	I will not give sleep to mine eyes, nor slumber to mine eyelids, nor rest to my temples,
019	PSA	132	005	until I find a place for the Lord, a tabernacle for the God of Jacob.
019	PSA	132	006	Behold, we heard of it in Ephratha; we found it in the fields of the wood.
019	PSA	132	007	Let us enter into his tabernacles: let us worship at the place where his feet stood.
019	PSA	132	008	Arise, O Lord, into thy rest; thou, and the ark of thine holiness.
019	PSA	132	009	Thy priests shall clothe themselves with righteousness; and thy saints shall exult.
019	PSA	132	010	For the sake of thy servant David turn not away the face of thine anointed.
019	PSA	132	011	The Lord sware [in] truth to David, and he will not annul it, [saying], Of the fruit of thy body will I set [a king] upon thy throne.
019	PSA	132	012	If thy children will deep my covenant, and these my testimonies which I shall teach them, their children also shall sit upon thy throne for ever.
019	PSA	132	013	For the Lord has elected Sion, he has chosen her for a habitation for himself, [saying],
019	PSA	132	014	This is my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have chosen it.
019	PSA	132	015	I will surely bless her provision: I will satisfy her poor with bread.
019	PSA	132	016	I will clothe her priests with salvation; and her saints shall greatly exult.
019	PSA	132	017	There will I cause to spring up a horn to David: I have prepared a lamp for mine anointed.
019	PSA	132	018	His enemies will I clothe with a shame; but upon himself shall my holiness flourish.
019	PSA	133	001	A Song of Degrees. See now! what is so good, or what so pleasant, as for brethren to dwell together?
019	PSA	133	002	[It is] as ointment on the head, that ran down to the beard, [even] the beard of Aaron; that ran down to the fringe of his clothing.
019	PSA	133	003	As the dew of Aermon, that comes down on the mountains of Sion: for there, the Lord commanded the blessing, even life for ever.
019	PSA	134	001	A Song of Degrees. Behold now, bless ye the Lord, all the servants of the Lord, who stand in the house of the Lord, in the courts of the house of our God.

019	PSA	135	003	Praise ye the Lord; for the Lord is good: sing praises to his name; for [it is] good.
019	PSA	135	004	For the Lord has chosen Jacob for himself, [and] Israel for his peculiar treasure.
019	PSA	135	005	For I know that the Lord is great, and our Lord is above all gods;
019	PSA	135	006	all that the Lord willed, he did in heaven, and on the earth, in the sea, and in all deeps.
019	PSA	135	007	Who brings up clouds from the extremity of the earth: he has made lightnings for the rain: he brings winds out of his treasures.
019	PSA	135	008	Who smote the first-born of Egypt, both of man and beast.
019	PSA	135	009	He sent signs and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt, on Pharao, and on all his servants.
019	PSA	135	010	Who smote many nations, and slew mighty kings;
019	PSA	135	011	Seon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Basan, and all the kingdoms of Chanaan:
019	PSA	135	012	and gave their land [for] an inheritance, an inheritance to Israel his people.
019	PSA	135	013	O Lord, thy name [endures] for ever, and thy memorial to all generations.
019	PSA	135	014	For the Lord shall judge his people, and comfort himself concerning his servants.
019	PSA	135	015	The idols of the heathen are silver and gold, the works of men's hands.
019	PSA	135	016	They have a mouth, but they cannot speak; they have eyes, but they cannot see;
019	PSA	135	017	they have ears, but they cannot hear; for there is no breath in their mouth.
019	PSA	135	018	Let those who make them be made like to them; and all those who trust in them.
019	PSA	135	019	O house of Israel, bless ye the Lord: O house of Aaron, bless ye the Lord:
019	PSA	135	020	O house of Levi, bless ye the Lord: ye that fear the Lord, bless the Lord.
019	PSA	135	021	Blessed in Sion be the Lord, who dwells in Jerusalem.

019	PSA	136	008	The sun to rule by day; for his mercy [endures] for ever.
019	PSA	136	009	The moon and the stars to rule the night; for his mercy [endures] for ever.
019	PSA	136	010	To him who smote Egypt with their first-born; for his mercy [endures] for ever.
019	PSA	136	011	And brought Israel out of the midst of them; for his mercy [endures] for ever:
019	PSA	136	012	with a strong hand, and a high arm: for his mercy [endures] for ever.
019	PSA	136	013	To him who divided the Red Sea into parts: for his mercy [endures] for ever:
019	PSA	136	014	and brought Israel through the midst of it: for his mercy [endures] for ever:
019	PSA	136	015	and overthrew Pharao and his host in the Red Sea: for his mercy endures for ever.

019	PSA	136	022	even an inheritance to Israel his servant: for his mercy [endures] for ever.
019	PSA	136	023	For the Lord remembered us in our low estate; for his mercy [endures] for ever:

019	PSA	136	025	Who gives food to all flesh; for his mercy [endures] for ever.
019	PSA	136	026	Give thanks to the God of heaven; for his mercy [endures] for ever.
019	PSA	137	001	For David, [a Psalm] of Jeremias. By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat; and wept when we remembered Sion.
019	PSA	137	002	We hung our harps on the willows in the midst of it.
019	PSA	137	003	For there they that had taken us captive asked of us the words of a song; and they that had carried us away [asked] a hymn, [saying], Sing us [one] of the songs of Sion.
019	PSA	137	004	How should we sing the Lord's song in a strange land?
019	PSA	137	005	If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget [its skill].
019	PSA	137	006	May my tongue cleave to my throat, if I do not remember thee; if I do not prefer Jerusalem as the chief of my joy.
019	PSA	137	007	Remember, O Lord, the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem; who said, Rase [it], rase [it], even to its foundations.
019	PSA	137	008	Wretched daughter of Babylon! blessed [shall he be] who shall reward thee as thou hast rewarded us.
019	PSA	137	009	Blessed [shall he be] who shall seize and dash thine infants against the rock.
019	PSA	138	001	A Psalm for David, of Aggaeus and Zacharias. I will give thee thanks, O Lord, with my whole heart; and I will sing psalms to thee before the angels; for thou hast heard all the words of my mouth.
019	PSA	138	002	I will worship toward thy holy temple, and give thanks to thy name, on account of thy mercy and thy truth; for thou hast magnified thy holy name above every thing.
019	PSA	138	003	In whatsoever day I shall call upon thee, hear me speedily; thou shalt abundantly provide me with thy power in my soul.
019	PSA	138	004	Let all the kings of the earth, o Lord, give thanks unto thee; for they have heard all the words of thy mouth.
019	PSA	138	005	And let them sing in the ways of the Lord; for great is the glory of the Lord.
019	PSA	138	006	For the Lord is high, and [yet] regards the lowly; and he knows high things from afar off.
019	PSA	138	007	Though I should walk in the midst of affliction, thou wilt quicken me; thou hast stretched forth thine hands against the wrath of mine enemies, and thy right hand has saved me.
019	PSA	138	008	O Lord, thou shalt recompense [them] on my behalf: thy mercy, O Lord, [endures] for ever: overlook not the works of thine hands.
019	PSA	139	001	For the end, a Psalm of David. O Lord, thou hast proved me, and known me.
019	PSA	139	002	Thou knowest my down-sitting and mine up-rising: thou understandest my thoughts long before.
019	PSA	139	003	Thou hast traced my path and my bed, and hast foreseen all my ways.
019	PSA	139	004	For there is no unrighteous word in my tongue: behold, O Lord, thou hast known all things,
019	PSA	139	005	the last and the first: thou hast fashioned me, and laid thine hand upon me.
019	PSA	139	006	The knowledge of thee is too wonderful for me; it is very difficult, I cannot [attain] to it.
019	PSA	139	007	Whither shall I go from thy Spirit? and whither shall I flee from my presence?
019	PSA	139	008	If I should go up to heaven, thou art there: if I should go down to hell, thou art present.
019	PSA	139	009	If I should spread my wings [to fly] straight forward, and sojourn at the extremity of the sea, [it would be vain],
019	PSA	139	010	for even there thy hand would guide me, and thy right hand would hold me.
019	PSA	139	011	When I said, Surely the darkness will cover me; even the night [was] light in my luxury.
019	PSA	139	012	For darkness will not be darkness with thee; but night will be light as day: as its darkness, so shall its light [be to thee].
019	PSA	139	013	For thou, O Lord, hast possessed my reins; thou hast helped me from my mother's womb.
019	PSA	139	014	I will give thee thanks; for thou art fearfully wondrous; wondrous are thy works; and my soul knows [it] well.
019	PSA	139	015	My bones, which thou madest in secret were not hidden from thee, nor my substance, in the lowest parts of the earth.
019	PSA	139	016	Thine eyes saw my unwrought [substance], and all [men] shall be written in thy book; they shall be formed by day, though [there should for a time] be no one among them.
019	PSA	139	017	But thy friends, O God, have been greatly honoured by me; their rule has been greatly strengthened.
019	PSA	139	018	I will number them, and they shall be multiplied beyond the sand; I awake, and am still with thee.
019	PSA	139	019	Oh that thou wouldest slay the wicked, O God; depart from me, ye men of blood.
019	PSA	139	020	For thou wilt say concerning [their] thought, [that] they shall take thy cities in vain.
019	PSA	139	021	Have I not hated them, O Lord, that hate thee? and wasted away because of thine enemies?
019	PSA	139	022	I have hated them with perfect hatred; they were counted my enemies.
019	PSA	139	023	Prove me, O God, and know my heart; examine me, and know my paths;
019	PSA	139	024	and see if [there is any] way of iniquity in me, and lead me in an everlasting way.
019	PSA	140	001	For the end, a Psalm of David. Rescue me, O Lord, from the evil man; deliver me from the unjust man.
019	PSA	140	002	Who have devised injustice in their hearts; all the day they prepared war.
019	PSA	140	003	They have sharpened their tongue as [the tongue] of a serpent; the poison of asps is under their lips. (Pause)
019	PSA	140	004	Keep me, O Lord, from the hand of the sinner; rescue me from unjust men; who have purposed to overthrow my goings.
019	PSA	140	005	The proud have hid a snare for me, and have stretched out ropes [for] snares for my feet; they set a stumbling-block for me near the path. (Pause)
019	PSA	140	006	I said to the Lord, Thou art my God; hearken, O Lord, to the voice of my supplication.
019	PSA	140	007	O Lord God, the strength of my salvation; thou hast screened my head in the day of battle.
019	PSA	140	008	Deliver me not, O Lord, to the sinner, according to my desire: they have devised [mischief] against me; forsake me not, lest they should be exalted. (Pause)
019	PSA	140	009	[As for] the head of them that compass me, the mischief of their lips shall cover them.
019	PSA	140	010	Coals of fire shall fall upon them on the earth; and thou shalt cast them down in afflictions: they shall not bear up [under them].
019	PSA	140	011	A talkative man shall not prosper on the earth: evils shall hunt the unrighteous man to destruction.
019	PSA	140	012	I know that the Lord will maintain the cause of the poor, and the right of the needy ones.
019	PSA	140	013	Surely the righteous shall give thanks to thy name: the upright shall dwell in thy presence.
019	PSA	141	001	A Psalm of David. O Lord, I have cried to thee; hear me: attend to the voice of my supplication, when I cry to thee.
019	PSA	141	002	Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense; the lifting up of my hands [as] an evening sacrifice.
019	PSA	141	003	Set a watch, O Lord, on my mouth, and a strong door about by lips.
019	PSA	141	004	Incline not my heart to evil things, to employ pretexts for sins, with me who work iniquity: and I will not. let me not unite with their choice ones.
019	PSA	141	005	The righteous shall chasten me with mercy, and reprove me: but let not the oil of the sinner anoint my head: for yet shall my prayer also be in their pleasures.
019	PSA	141	006	Their mighty ones have been swallowed up near the rock: they shall hear my words, for they are sweet.
019	PSA	141	007	As a lump of earth is crushed upon the ground, our bones have been scattered by the [mouth of] the grave.
019	PSA	141	008	For mine eyes are to thee, O Lord God: I have hoped in thee; take not away my life.
019	PSA	141	009	Keep me from the snare which they have set for me, and from the stumbling blocks of them that work iniquity.
019	PSA	141	010	Sinners shall fall by their own net: I am alone until I shall escape.
019	PSA	142	001	[A Psalm] of instruction for David, when he was in the cave, —a Prayer. I cried to the Lord with my voice; with my voice I made supplication to the Lord.
019	PSA	142	002	I will pour out before him my supplication: I will declare before him mine affliction.
019	PSA	142	003	When my spirit was fainting within me, then thou knewest my paths; in the very way wherein I was walking, they hid a snare for me.
019	PSA	142	004	I looked on [my] right hand, and behold, for there was none that noticed me; refuge failed me; and there was none that cared for my soul.
019	PSA	142	005	I cried unto thee, O Lord, and said, Thou art my hope, my portion in the land of the living.
019	PSA	142	006	Attend to my supplication, for I am brought very low; deliver me from them that persecute me; for they are stronger than I.
019	PSA	142	007	Bring my soul out of prison, that I may give thanks to thy name, O Lord; the righteous shall wait for me, until thou recompense me.
019	PSA	143	001	A Psalm of David, when his son pursued him. O Lord, attend to my prayer: hearken to my supplication in thy truth; hear me in thy righteousness.
019	PSA	143	002	And enter not into judgment with thy servant, for in thy sight shall no [man] living be justified.
019	PSA	143	003	For the enemy has persecuted my soul; he has brought my life down to the ground; he has made me to dwell in a dark [place], as those that have been long dead.
019	PSA	143	004	Therefore my spirit was grieved in me; my heart was troubled within me.
019	PSA	143	005	I remembered the days of old; and I meditated on all thy doings: [yea], I meditated on the works of thine hands.
019	PSA	143	006	I spread forth my hands to thee; my soul [thirsts] for thee, as a dry land. (Pause)
019	PSA	143	007	Hear me speedily, O Lord; my spirit has failed; turn not away thy face from me, else I shall be like to them that go down to the pit.

# BOOK	020	PRO	Proverbs	Proverbs
020	PRO	001	001	The Proverbs of Solomon son of David, who reigned in Israel;
020	PRO	001	002	to know wisdom and instruction, and to perceive words of understanding;
020	PRO	001	003	to receive also hard saying, and to understand true justice, and [how] to direct judgment;
020	PRO	001	004	that he might give subtlety to the simple, and to the young man discernment and understanding.
020	PRO	001	005	For by the hearing of these a wise man will be wiser, and man of understanding will gain direction;
020	PRO	001	006	and will understand a parable, and a dark speech; the saying of the wise also, and riddles.
020	PRO	001	007	The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom; and [there is] good understanding to all that practise it: and piety toward God is the beginning of discernment; but the ungodly will set at nought wisdom and instruction.
020	PRO	001	008	Hear, [my] son, the instruction of thy father, and reject not the rules of thy mother.
020	PRO	001	009	For thou shalt receive for thine head a crown of graces, and a chain of gold round thy neck.
020	PRO	001	010	[My] son, let not ungodly men lead thee astray, neither consent thou [to them].
020	PRO	001	011	If they should exhort thee, saying, Come with us, partake in blood, and let us unjustly hide the just man in the earth:
020	PRO	001	012	and let us swallow him alive, as Hades [would], and remove the memorial of him from the earth:
020	PRO	001	013	let us seize on his valuable property, and let us fill our houses with spoils:
020	PRO	001	014	but do thou cast in thy lot with us, and let us all provide a common purse, and let us have one pouch:
020	PRO	001	015	go not in the way with them, but turn aside thy foot from their paths:
020	PRO	001	016	[For their feet run to do evil, and are swift to shed blood.]
020	PRO	001	017	for nets are not without cause spread for birds.
020	PRO	001	018	For they that are concerned in murder store up evils for themselves; and the overthrow of transgressors is evil.
020	PRO	001	019	These are the ways of all that perform lawless deeds; for by ungodliness they destroy their own life.
020	PRO	001	020	Wisdom sings aloud in passages, and in the broad places speaks boldly.
020	PRO	001	021	And she makes proclamation on the top of the walls, and sits by the gates of princes; and at the gates of the city boldly says,
020	PRO	001	022	So long as the simple cleave to justice, they shall not be ashamed: but the foolish being lovers of haughtiness, having become ungodly have hated knowledge, and are become subject to reproofs.
020	PRO	001	023	Behold, I will bring forth to you the utterance of my breath, and I will instruct you in my speech.
020	PRO	001	024	Since I called, and ye did not hearken; and I spoke at length, and ye gave no heed;
020	PRO	001	025	but ye set at nought my counsels, and disregarded my reproofs;
020	PRO	001	026	therefore I also will laugh at your destruction; and I will rejoice against [you] when ruin comes upon you:
020	PRO	001	027	yea when dismay suddenly comes upon you, and [your] overthrow shall arrive like a tempest; and when tribulation and distress shall come upon you, or when ruin shall come upon you.
020	PRO	001	028	For it shall be that when ye call upon me, I will not hearken to you: wicked men shall seek me, but shall not find [me].
020	PRO	001	029	For they hated wisdom, and did not choose the word of the Lord:
020	PRO	001	030	neither would they attend to my counsels, but derided my reproofs.
020	PRO	001	031	Therefore shall they eat the fruits of their own way, and shall be filled with their own ungodliness.
020	PRO	001	032	For because they wronged the simple, they shall be slain; and an inquisition shall ruin the ungodly.
020	PRO	001	033	But he that hearkens to me shall dwell in confidence, and shall rest securely from all evil.
020	PRO	002	001	[My] son, if thou wilt receive the utterance of my commandment, and hide it with thee;
020	PRO	002	002	thine ear shall hearken to wisdom; thou shalt also apply thine heart to understanding, and shalt apply it to the instruction of thy son.
020	PRO	002	003	For it thou shalt call to wisdom, and utter thy voice for understanding;
020	PRO	002	004	and if thou shalt seek it as silver, and search diligently for it as for treasures;
020	PRO	002	005	then shalt thou understand the fear of the Lord, and find the knowledge of God.
020	PRO	002	006	For the Lord gives wisdom; and from his presence [come] knowledge and understanding,
020	PRO	002	007	and he treasures up salvation for them that walk uprightly: he will protect their way;
020	PRO	002	008	that he may guard the righteous ways: and he will preserve the way of them that fear him.
020	PRO	002	009	Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment; and shalt direct all thy course aright.
020	PRO	002	010	For if wisdom shall come into thine understanding, and discernment shall seem pleasing to thy soul,
020	PRO	002	011	good counsel shall guard thee, and holy understanding shall keep thee;
020	PRO	002	012	to deliver thee from the evil way, and from the man that speaks nothing faithfully.
020	PRO	002	013	Alas [for those] who forsake right paths, to walk in ways of darkness;
020	PRO	002	014	who rejoice in evils, and delight in wicked perverseness;
020	PRO	002	015	whose paths are crooked, and their courses winding;
020	PRO	002	016	to remove thee far from the straight way, and to estrange thee from a righteous purpose. [My] son, let not evil counsel overtake thee,
020	PRO	002	017	[of her] who has forsaken the instruction of her youth, and forgotten the covenant of God.
020	PRO	002	018	For she has fixed her house near death, and [guided] her wheels near Hades with the giants.
020	PRO	002	019	None that go by her shall return, neither shall they take hold of right paths, for they are not apprehended of the years of life.
020	PRO	002	020	For had they gone in good paths, they would have found the paths of righteousness easy.
020	PRO	002	021	For the upright shall dwell in the earth, and the holy shall be left behind in it.
020	PRO	002	022	The paths of the ungodly shall perish out of the earth, and transgressors shall be driven away from it.
020	PRO	003	001	[My] son, forget not my laws; but let thine heart keep my words:
020	PRO	003	002	for length of existence, and years of life, and peace, shall they add to thee.
020	PRO	003	003	Let not mercy and truth forsake thee; but bind them about thy neck:
020	PRO	003	004	so shalt thou find favour: and do thou provide things honest in the sight of the Lord, and of men.
020	PRO	003	005	Trust in God with all thine heart; and be not exalted in thine own wisdom.
020	PRO	003	006	In all thy ways acquaint thyself with her, that she may rightly direct thy paths.
020	PRO	003	007	Be not wise in thine own conceit; but fear God, and depart from all evil.
020	PRO	003	008	Then shall there be health to thy body, and good keeping to thy bones.
020	PRO	003	009	Honour the Lord with thy just labours, and give him the first of thy fruits of righteousness:
020	PRO	003	010	that thy storehouses may be completely filled with corn, and that thy presses may burst forth with wine.
020	PRO	003	011	[My] son, despise not the chastening of the Lord; nor faint when thou art rebuked of him:
020	PRO	003	012	for whom the Lord loves, he rebukes, and scourges every son whom he receives.
020	PRO	003	013	Blessed is the man who has found wisdom, and the mortal who knows prudence.
020	PRO	003	014	For it is better to traffic for her, than for treasures of gold and silver.
020	PRO	003	015	And she is more valuable than precious stones: no evil thing shall resist her: she is well known to all that approach her, and no precious thing is equal to her in value.
020	PRO	003	016	For length of existence and years of life are in her right hand; and in her left hand are wealth and glory: out of her mouth proceeds righteousness, and she carries law and mercy upon her tongue.
020	PRO	003	017	Her ways are good ways, and all her paths are peaceful.
020	PRO	003	018	She is a tree of life to all that lay hold upon her; and she is [a] secure [help] to all that stay themselves on her, as on the Lord.
020	PRO	003	019	God by wisdom founded the earth, and by prudence he prepared the heavens.
020	PRO	003	020	By understanding were the depths broken up, and the clouds dropped water.
020	PRO	003	021	[My] son, let [them] not pass from [thee], but keep my counsel and understanding:
020	PRO	003	022	that thy soul may live, and that there may be grace round thy neck; and it shall be health to thy flesh, and safety to thy bones:
020	PRO	003	023	that thou mayest go confidently in peace in all thy ways, and that thy foot may not stumble.
020	PRO	003	024	For if thou rest, thou shalt be undismayed; and if thou sleep, thou shalt slumber sweetly.
020	PRO	003	025	And thou shalt not be afraid of alarm coming upon thee, neither of approaching attacks of ungodly men.
020	PRO	003	026	For the Lord shall be over all thy ways, and shall establish thy foot that thou be not moved.
020	PRO	003	027	Forbear not to do good to the poor, whensoever thy hand may have [power] to help [him].
020	PRO	003	028	Say not, Come back another time, to-morrow I will give; while thou art able to do [him] good: for thou knowest not what the next day will bring forth.
020	PRO	003	029	Devise not evil against thy friend, living near thee and trusting in thee.
020	PRO	003	030	Be not ready to quarrel with a man without a cause, lest he do thee some harm.
020	PRO	003	031	Procure not the reproaches of bad men, neither do thou covet their ways.
020	PRO	003	032	For every transgressor is unclean before the Lord; neither does he sit among the righteous.
020	PRO	003	033	The curse of God is in the houses of the ungodly; but the habitations of the just are blessed.
020	PRO	003	034	The Lord resists the proud; but he gives grace to the humble.
020	PRO	003	035	The wise shall inherit glory; but the ungodly have exalted [their own] dishonour.
020	PRO	004	001	Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding.
020	PRO	004	002	For I give you a good gift; forsake ye not my law.
020	PRO	004	003	For I also was a son obedient to [my] father, and loved in the sight of [my] mother:
020	PRO	004	004	who spoke and instructed me, [saying], Let our speech be fixed in thine heart, keep [our] commandments, forget them not:
020	PRO	004	005	and do not neglect the speech of my mouth.
020	PRO	004	006	And forsake it not, and it shall cleave to thee: love it, and it shall keep thee.
020	PRO	004	008	Secure it, and it shall exalt thee: honour it, that it may embrace thee;
020	PRO	004	009	that it may give unto thy head a crown of graces, and may cover thee with a crown of delight.
020	PRO	004	010	Hear, [my] son, and receive my words; and the years of thy life shall be increased, that the resources of thy life may be many.
020	PRO	004	011	For I teach thee the ways of wisdom; and I cause thee to go in right paths.
020	PRO	004	012	For when thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; and when thou runnest, thou shalt not be distressed.
020	PRO	004	013	Take hold of my instruction; let it not go, —but keep it for thyself for thy life.
020	PRO	004	014	Go not in the ways of the ungodly, neither covet the ways of transgressors.
020	PRO	004	015	In whatever place they shall pitch their camp, go not thither; but turn from them, and pass away.
020	PRO	004	016	For they cannot sleep, unless they have done evil: their sleep is taken away, and they rest not.
020	PRO	004	017	For these live upon the bread of ungodliness, and are drunken with wine of transgression.
020	PRO	004	018	But the ways of the righteous shine like light; they go on and shine, until the day be fully come.
020	PRO	004	019	But the ways of the ungodly are dark; they know not how they stumble.
020	PRO	004	020	[My] son, attend to my speech; and apply thine ear to my words:
020	PRO	004	021	that thy fountains may not fail thee; keep them in [thine] heart.
020	PRO	004	022	For they are life to those that find them, and health to all [their] flesh.
020	PRO	004	023	Keep thine heart with the utmost care; for out of these are the issues of life.
020	PRO	004	024	Remove from thee a froward mouth, and put far away from thee unjust lips.
020	PRO	004	025	Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids assent [to] just [things].
020	PRO	004	026	Make straight paths for thy feet, and order thy ways aright.
020	PRO	004	027	Turn not aside to the right hand nor to the left, but turn away thy foot from an evil way: [for God knows the ways on the right hand, but those on the left are crooked:] and he will make thy ways straight, and will guide thy steps in peace.
020	PRO	005	001	[My] son, attend to my wisdom, and apply thine ear to my words;
020	PRO	005	002	that thou mayest keep good understanding, and the discretion of my lips gives thee a charge. Give no heed to a worthless woman;
020	PRO	005	003	for honey drops from the lips of a harlot, who for a season pleases thy palate:
020	PRO	005	004	but afterwards thou wilt find her more bitter than gall, and sharper than a two-edged sword.
020	PRO	005	005	For the feet of folly lead those who deal with her down to the grave with death; and her steps are not established.
020	PRO	005	006	For she goes not upon the paths of life; but her ways are slippery, and not easily known.
020	PRO	005	007	Now then, [my] son, hear me, and make not my words of none effect.
020	PRO	005	008	Remove thy way far from her; draw not near to the doors of her house:
020	PRO	005	009	lest thou give away thy life to others, and thy substance to the merciless:
020	PRO	005	010	lest strangers be filled with thy strength, and thy labours come into the houses of strangers;
020	PRO	005	011	And thou repent at last, when the flesh of thy body is consumed,
020	PRO	005	012	and thou shalt say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart avoided reproofs!
020	PRO	005	013	I heard not the voice of him that instructed me, and taught me, neither did I apply mine ear.
020	PRO	005	014	I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly.
020	PRO	005	015	Drink waters out of thine own vessels, and out of thine own springing wells.
020	PRO	005	016	Let not waters out of thy fountain be spilt by thee, but let thy waters go into thy streets.
020	PRO	005	017	Let them be only thine own, and let no stranger partake with thee.
020	PRO	005	018	Let thy fountain of water be [truly] thine own; and rejoice with the wife of thy youth.
020	PRO	005	019	Let [thy] loving hart and thy graceful colt company with thee, and let her be considered thine own, and be with thee at all times; for ravished with her love thou shalt be greatly increased.
020	PRO	005	020	Be not intimate with a strange woman, neither fold thyself in the arms of a woman not thine own.
020	PRO	005	021	For the ways of a man are before the eyes of God, and he looks on all his paths.
020	PRO	005	022	Iniquities ensnare a man, and every one is bound in the chains of his own sins.
020	PRO	005	023	Such a man dies with the uninstructed; and he is cast forth from the abundance of his own substance, and has perished through folly.
020	PRO	006	001	[My] son, if thou become surety for thy friend, thou shalt deliver thine hand to an enemy.
020	PRO	006	002	For a man's own lips become a strong snare to him, and he is caught with the lips of his own mouth.
020	PRO	006	003	[My] son, do what I command thee, and deliver thyself; for on thy friend's account thou art come into the power of evil [men]: faint not, but stir up even thy friend for whom thou art become surety.
020	PRO	006	004	Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber with thine eyelids;
020	PRO	006	005	that thou mayest deliver thyself as a doe out of the toils, and as a bird out of a snare.
020	PRO	006	006	Go to the ant, O sluggard; and see, and emulate his ways, and become wiser than he.
020	PRO	006	007	For whereas he has no husbandry, nor any one to compel him, and is under no master,
020	PRO	006	008	he prepares food for himself in the summer, and lays by abundant store in harvest. Or go to the bee, and learn how diligent she is, and how earnestly she is engaged in her work; whose labours kings and private men use for health, and she is desired and respected by all: though weak in body, she is advanced by honouring wisdom.
020	PRO	006	009	How long wilt thou lie, O sluggard? and when wilt thou awake out of sleep?
020	PRO	006	010	Thou sleepest a little, and thou restest a little, and thou slumberest a short [time], and thou foldest thine arms over thy breast a little.
020	PRO	006	011	Then poverty comes upon thee as an evil traveller, and want as a swift courier: but if thou be diligent, thine harvest shall arrive as a fountain, and poverty shall flee away as a bad courier.
020	PRO	006	012	A foolish man and a transgressor goes in ways that are not good.
020	PRO	006	013	And the same winks with the eye, and makes a sign with his foot, and teaches with the beckonings of his fingers.
020	PRO	006	014	[His] perverse heart devises evils: at all times such a one causes troubles to a city.
020	PRO	006	015	Therefore his destruction shall come suddenly; overthrow and irretrievable ruin.
020	PRO	006	016	For he rejoices in all things which God hates, and he is ruined by reason of impurity of soul.
020	PRO	006	017	The eye of the haughty, a tongue unjust, hands shedding the blood of the just;
020	PRO	006	018	and a heart devising evil thoughts, and feet hastening to do evil, —[are hateful to God].
020	PRO	006	019	An unjust witness kindles falsehoods, and brings on quarrels between brethren.
020	PRO	006	020	[My] son, keep the laws of thy father, and reject not the ordinances of thy mother:
020	PRO	006	021	but bind them upon thy soul continually, and hang them as a chain about thy neck.
020	PRO	006	022	Whensoever thou walkest, lead this along and let it be with thee; that it may talk with thee when thou wakest.
020	PRO	006	023	For the commandment of the law is a lamp and a light; a way of life; reproof also and correction:
020	PRO	006	024	to keep thee continually from a married woman, and from the calumny of a strange tongue.
020	PRO	006	025	Let not the desire of beauty overcome thee, neither be thou caught by thine eyes, neither be captivated with her eyelids.
020	PRO	006	026	For the value of a harlot is as much as of one loaf; and a woman hunts for the precious souls of men.
020	PRO	006	027	Shall any one bind fire in his bosom, and not burn his garments?
020	PRO	006	028	or will any one walk on coals of fire, and not burn his feet?
020	PRO	006	029	So is he that goes in to a married woman; he shall not be held guiltless, neither any one that touches her.
020	PRO	006	030	It is not to be wondered at if one should be taken stealing, for he steals that when hungry he may satisfy his soul:
020	PRO	006	031	but if he should be taken, he shall repay sevenfold, and shall deliver himself by giving all his goods.
020	PRO	006	032	But the adulterer through want of sense procures destruction to his soul.
020	PRO	006	033	He endures both pain and disgrace, and his reproach shall never be wiped off.
020	PRO	006	034	For the soul of her husband is full of jealousy: he will not spare in the day of vengeance.
020	PRO	006	035	He will not forego [his] enmity for any ransom: neither will he be reconciled for many gifts.
020	PRO	007	001	[My] son, keep my words, and hide with thee my commandments. [My] son, honour the Lord, and thou shalt be strong; and fear none but him:
020	PRO	007	002	keep my commandments, and thou shalt live; and [keep] my words as the pupils of [thine] eyes.
020	PRO	007	003	And bind them on thy fingers, and write [them] on the table of thine heart.
020	PRO	007	004	Say that wisdom is thy sister, and gain prudence as an acquaintance for thyself;
020	PRO	007	005	that she may keep thee from the strange and wicked woman, if she should assail thee with flattering words.
020	PRO	007	006	For she looks from a window out of her house into the streets, at one whom she may see of the senseless ones, a young man void of understanding,
020	PRO	007	007	passing by the corner in the passages near her house,
020	PRO	007	008	and speaking, in the dark of the evening,
020	PRO	007	009	when there happens [to be] the stillness of night and of darkness:
020	PRO	007	010	and the woman meets him having the appearance of a harlot, that causes the hearts of young men to flutter.
020	PRO	007	011	And she is fickle, and debauched, and her feet abide not at home.
020	PRO	007	012	For at one time she wanders without, and at [another] time she lies in wait in the streets, at every corner.
020	PRO	007	013	Then she caught him, and kissed him, and with an impudent face said to him,
020	PRO	007	014	I have a peace-offering; today I pay my vows:
020	PRO	007	015	therefore I came forth to meet thee, desiring thy face; [and] I have found thee.
020	PRO	007	016	I have spread my bed with sheets, and I have covered it with double tapestry from Egypt.
020	PRO	007	017	I have sprinkled my couch with saffron, and my house with cinnamon.
020	PRO	007	018	Come, and let us enjoy love until the morning; come, and let us embrace in love.
020	PRO	007	019	For my husband is not at home, but is gone on a long journey,
020	PRO	007	020	having taken in his hand a bundle of money: after many days he will return to his house.
020	PRO	007	021	So with much converse she prevailed on him to go astray, and with the snares of her lips forced him from [the right path].
020	PRO	007	022	And he followed her, being gently led on, and [that] as an ox is led to the slaughter, and as a dog to bonds, or as a hart shot in the liver with an arrow:
020	PRO	007	023	and he hastens as a bird into a snare, not knowing that he is running for [his] life.
020	PRO	007	024	Now then, [my] son, hearken to me, and attend to the words of my mouth.
020	PRO	007	025	Let not thine heart turn aside to her ways:
020	PRO	007	026	for she has wounded and cast down many, and those whom she has slain are innumerable.
020	PRO	007	027	Her house is the way of hell, leading down to the chambers of death.
020	PRO	008	001	Thou shalt proclaim wisdom, that understanding may be obedient to thee.
020	PRO	008	002	For she is on lofty eminences, and stands in the midst of the ways.
020	PRO	008	003	For she sits by the gates of princes, and sings in the entrances, [saying],
020	PRO	008	004	You, O men, I exhort; and utter my voice to the sons of men.
020	PRO	008	005	O ye simple, understand subtlety, and ye that are untaught, imbibe knowledge.
020	PRO	008	006	Hearken to me; for I will speak solemn [truths]; and will produce right [sayings] from my lips.
020	PRO	008	007	For my throat shall meditate truth; and false lips are an abomination before me.
020	PRO	008	008	All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; there is nothing in them wrong or perverse.
020	PRO	008	009	They are all evident to those that understand, and right to those that find knowledge.
020	PRO	008	010	Receive instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than tried gold.
020	PRO	008	011	For wisdom is better than precious stones; and no valuable substance is of equal worth with it.
020	PRO	008	012	I wisdom have dwelt [with] counsel and knowledge, and I have called upon understanding.
020	PRO	008	013	The fear of the Lord hates unrighteousness, and insolence, and pride, and the ways of wicked men; and I hate the perverse ways of bad men.
020	PRO	008	014	Counsel and safety are mine; prudence is mine, and strength is mine.
020	PRO	008	015	By me kings reign, and princes decree justice.
020	PRO	008	016	By me nobles become great, and monarchs by me rule over the earth.
020	PRO	008	017	I love those that love me; and they that seek me shall find [me].
020	PRO	008	018	Wealth and glory belong to me; yea, abundant possessions and righteousness.
020	PRO	008	019	[It is] better to have my fruit than [to have] gold and precious stones; and my produce is better than choice silver.
020	PRO	008	020	I walk in ways of righteousness, and [am] conversant with the paths of judgment;
020	PRO	008	021	that I may divide substance to them that love me, and may fill their treasures with good things. If I declare to you the things that daily happen, I will remember [also] to recount the things of old.
020	PRO	008	022	The Lord made me the beginning of his ways for his works.
020	PRO	008	023	He established me before time [was] in the beginning, before he made the earth:
020	PRO	008	024	even before he made the depths; before the fountains of water came forth:
020	PRO	008	025	before the mountains were settled, and before all hills, he begets me.
020	PRO	008	026	The Lord made countries and uninhabited [tracks], and the highest inhabited parts of the world.
020	PRO	008	027	When he prepared the heaven, I was present with him; and when he prepared his throne upon the winds:
020	PRO	008	028	and when he strengthened the clouds above; and when he secured the fountains of the earth:
020	PRO	008	029	decree. and when he strengthened the foundations of the earth:
020	PRO	008	030	I was by him, suiting [myself to him], I was that wherein he took delight; and daily I rejoiced in his presence continually.
020	PRO	008	031	For he rejoiced when he had completed the world, and rejoiced among the children of men.
020	PRO	008	032	Now then, [my] son, hear me: blessed is the man who shall hearken to me, and the mortal who shall keep my ways;
020	PRO	008	033	[Hear wisdom and be wise, and] [be not strangers to it.]
020	PRO	008	034	watching daily at my doors, waiting at the posts of my entrances.
020	PRO	008	035	For my outgoings are the outgoings of life, and [in them] is prepared favour from the Lord.
020	PRO	008	036	But they that sin against me act wickedly against their own souls: and they that hate me love death.
020	PRO	009	001	Wisdom has built a house for herself, and set up seven pillars.
020	PRO	009	002	She has killed her beasts; she has mingled her wine in a bowl, and prepared her table.
020	PRO	009	003	She has sent forth her servants, calling with a loud proclamation to the feast, saying,
020	PRO	009	004	Whoso is foolish, let him turn aside to me: and to them that want understanding she says,
020	PRO	009	005	Come, eat of my bread, and drink wine which I have mingled for you.
020	PRO	009	006	Leave folly, that ye may reign for ever; and seek wisdom, and improve understanding by knowledge.
020	PRO	009	007	He that reproves evil [men] shall get dishonour to himself; and he that rebukes an ungodly [man] shall disgrace himself.
020	PRO	009	008	Rebuke not evil [men], lest they should hate thee: rebuke a wise [man], and he will love thee.
020	PRO	009	009	Give an opportunity to a wise [man], and he will be wiser: instruct a just man, and he will receive more [instruction].
020	PRO	009	010	The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and the counsel of saints is understanding: for to know the law is [the character] of a sound mind.
020	PRO	009	011	For in this way thou shalt live long, and years of thy life shall be added to thee.
020	PRO	009	012	Son, if thou be wise for thyself, thou shalt also be wise for thy neighbours; and if thou shouldest prove wicked, thou alone wilt bear the evil. He that stays himself upon falsehoods, attempts to rule the winds, and the same will pursue birds in their fight: for he has forsaken the ways of his own vineyard, and he has caused the axles of his own husbandry to go astray; and he goes through a dry desert, and a [land] appointed to drought, and he gathers barrenness with his hands.
020	PRO	009	013	A foolish and bold woman, who knows not modesty, comes to want a morsel.
020	PRO	009	014	She sits at the doors of her house, on a seat openly in the streets,
020	PRO	009	015	calling to passers by, and to those that are going right on their ways;
020	PRO	009	016	[saying], Whoso is most senseless of you, let him turn aside to me; and I exhort those that want prudence, saying,
020	PRO	009	017	Take and enjoy secret bread, and the sweet water of theft.
020	PRO	009	018	But he knows that mighty men die by her, and he falls in with a snare of hell.
020	PRO	010	001	A wise son makes [his] father glad: but a foolish son is a grief to his mother.
020	PRO	010	002	Treasures shall not profit the lawless: but righteousness shall deliver from death.
020	PRO	010	003	The Lord will not famish a righteous soul: but he will overthrow the life of the ungodly.
020	PRO	010	004	Poverty brings a man low: but the hands of the vigorous make rich. A son who is instructed shall be wise, and shall use the fool for a servant.
020	PRO	010	005	A wise son is saved from heat: but a lawless son is blighted of the winds in harvest.
020	PRO	010	006	The blessing of the Lord is upon the head of the just: but untimely grief shall cover the mouth of the ungodly.
020	PRO	010	007	The memory of the just is praised; but the name of the ungodly [man] is extinguished.
020	PRO	010	008	A wise man in heart will receive commandments; but he that is unguarded in his lips shall be overthrown in his perverseness.
020	PRO	010	009	He that walks simply, walks confidently; but he that perverts his ways shall be known.
020	PRO	010	010	He that winks with his eyes deceitfully, procures griefs for men; but he that reproves boldly is a peacemaker.
020	PRO	010	011	[There is] a fountain of life in the hand of a righteous man; but destruction shall cover the mouth of the ungodly.
020	PRO	010	012	Hatred stirs up strife; but affection covers all that do not love strife.
020	PRO	010	013	He that brings forth wisdom from his lips smites the fool with a rod.
020	PRO	010	014	The wise will hide discretion; but the mouth of the hasty draws near to ruin.
020	PRO	010	015	The wealth of rich men is a strong city; but poverty is the ruin of the ungodly.
020	PRO	010	016	The works of the righteous produce life; but the fruits of the ungodly [produce] sins.
020	PRO	010	017	Instruction keeps the right ways of life; but instruction unchastened goes astray.
020	PRO	010	018	Righteous lips cover enmity; but they that utter railings are most foolish.
020	PRO	010	019	By a multitude of words thou shalt not escape sin; but if thou refrain thy lips thou wilt be prudent.
020	PRO	010	020	The tongue of the just is tried silver; but the heart of the ungodly shall fail.
020	PRO	010	021	The lips of the righteous know sublime [truths]: but the foolish die in want.
020	PRO	010	022	The blessing of the Lord is upon the head of the righteous; it enriches [him], and grief of heart shall not be added to [it].
020	PRO	010	023	A fool does mischief in sport; but wisdom brings forth prudence for a man.
020	PRO	010	024	The ungodly is engulphed in destruction; but the desire of the righteous is acceptable.
020	PRO	010	025	When the storm passes by, the ungodly vanishes away; but the righteous turns aside and escapes for ever.
020	PRO	010	026	As a sour grape is hurtful to the teeth, and smoke to the eyes, so iniquity hurts those that practise it.
020	PRO	010	027	The fear of the Lord adds [length] of days: but the years of the ungodly shall be shortened.
020	PRO	010	028	Joy rests long with the righteous: but the hope of the ungodly shall perish.
020	PRO	010	029	The fear of the Lord is a strong hold of the saints: but ruin [comes] to them that work wickedness.
020	PRO	010	030	The righteous shall never fail: but the ungodly shall not dwell in the earth.
020	PRO	010	031	The mouth of the righteous drops wisdom: but the tongue of the unjust shall perish.
020	PRO	010	032	The lips of just men drop grace: but the mouth of the ungodly is perverse.
020	PRO	011	001	False balances are an abomination before the Lord: but a just weight is acceptable unto him.
020	PRO	011	002	Wherever pride enters, there will be also disgrace: but the mouth of the lowly meditates wisdom.
020	PRO	011	003	When a just man dies he leaves regret: but the destruction of the ungodly is speedy, and causes joy.

020	PRO	011	005	Righteousness traces out blameless paths: but ungodliness encounters unjust dealing.
020	PRO	011	006	The righteousness of upright men delivers them: but transgressors are caught in their own destruction.
020	PRO	011	007	At the death of a just man his hope does not perish: but the boast of the ungodly perishes.
020	PRO	011	008	A righteous man escapes from a snare, and the ungodly man is delivered up in his place.
020	PRO	011	009	In the mouth of ungodly men is a snare to citizens: but the understanding of righteous men is prosperous.
020	PRO	011	010	In the prosperity of righteous men a city prospers: but by the mouth of ungodly men it is overthrown.
020	PRO	011	011	[At the blessing of the upright a city shall be exalted.]
020	PRO	011	012	A man void of understanding sneers at [his fellow] citizens: but a sensible man is quiet.

020	PRO	026	011	As when a dog goes to his own vomit, and becomes abominable, so is fool who returns in his wickedness to his own sin. [There is a shame that brings sin: and there is a shame [that is] glory and grace.]
020	PRO	026	012	I have seen a man who seemed to himself to be wise; but a fool had more hope than he.
020	PRO	026	013	A sluggard when sent on a journey says, [There is] a lion in the ways, and [there are] murderers in the streets.
020	PRO	026	014	As a door turns on the hinge, so does a sluggard on his bed.
020	PRO	026	015	A sluggard having hid his hand in his bosom, will not be able to bring it up to his mouth.
020	PRO	026	016	A sluggard seems to himself wiser than one who most satisfactorily brings back a message.
020	PRO	026	017	As he that lays hold of a dog's tail, so is he that makes himself the champion of another's cause.
020	PRO	026	018	As those who need correction put forth [fair] words to men, and he that first falls in with the proposal will be overthrown;
020	PRO	026	019	so are all that lay wait for their own friends, and when they are discovered, say, I did it in jest.
020	PRO	026	020	With much wood fire increases; but where there is not a double-minded man, strife ceases.
020	PRO	026	021	A hearth for coals, and wood for fire; and railing man for the tumult of strife.
020	PRO	026	022	The words of cunning knaves are soft; but they smite [even] to the inmost parts of the bowels.
020	PRO	026	023	Silver dishonestly given is to be considered as a potsherd: smooth lips cover a grievous heart.
020	PRO	026	024	A weeping enemy promises all things with his lips, but in his heart he contrives deceit.
020	PRO	026	025	Though [thine] enemy intreat thee with a loud voice, consent not: for there are seven abominations in his heart.
020	PRO	026	026	He that hides enmity frames deceit: but being easily discerned, exposes his own sins in the public assemblies.
020	PRO	026	027	He that digs a pit for his neighbour shall fall into it: and he that rolls a stone, rolls it upon himself.
020	PRO	026	028	A lying tongue hates the truth; and an unguarded mouth causes tumults.
020	PRO	027	001	Boast not of to-morrow; for thou knowest not what the next day shall bring forth.
020	PRO	027	002	Let thy neighbour, and not thine own mouth, praise thee; a stranger, and not thine own lips.
020	PRO	027	003	A stone is heavy, and sand cumbersome; but a fool's wrath is heavier than both.

020	PRO	027	010	Thine own friend, and thy father's friend, forsake not; and when thou art in distress go not into thy brother's house: better is a friend [that is] near than a brother living far off.

020	PRO	027	021	Fire is the trial for silver and gold; and a man is tried by the mouth of them that praise him. The heart of the transgressor seeks after mischiefs; but an upright heart seeks knowledge.

020	PRO	028	004	so they that forsake the law praise ungodliness; but they that love the law fortify themselves with a wall.
020	PRO	028	005	Evil men will not understand judgment: but they that seek the Lord will understand everything.

020	PRO	030	018	Moreover there are three things impossible for me to comprehend, and the fourth I know not:
020	PRO	030	019	the track of a flying eagle; and the ways of a serpent on a rock; and the paths of a ship passing through the sea; and the ways of a man in youth.
020	PRO	030	020	Such is the way of an adulterous woman, who having washed herself from what she has done, says she has done nothing amiss.
020	PRO	030	021	By three thing the earth is troubled, and the fourth it cannot bear:

020	PRO	030	023	or if a maid-servant should cast out her own mistress; and if a hateful woman should marry a good man.
020	PRO	030	024	And [there are] four very little things upon the earth, but these are wiser than the wise:
020	PRO	030	025	the ants which are weak, and [yet] prepare [their] food in summer;
020	PRO	030	026	the rabbits also [are] a feeble race, who make their houses in the rocks.
020	PRO	030	027	The locusts have no king, and [yet] march orderly at one command.
020	PRO	030	028	And the eft, which supports itself by [its] hands, and is easily taken, dwells in the fortresses of kings.
020	PRO	030	029	And there are three things which go well, and a fourth which passes along finely.
020	PRO	030	030	A lion's whelp, stronger than [all other] beasts, which turns not away, nor fears [any] beast;
020	PRO	030	031	and a cock walking in boldly among the hens, and the goat leading the herd; and a king publicly speaking before a nation.
020	PRO	030	032	If thou abandon thyself to mirth, and stretch forth thine hand in a quarrel, thou shalt be disgraced.
020	PRO	030	033	Milk out milk, and there shall be butter, and if thou wing [one's] nostrils there shall come out blood: so if thou extort words, there will come forth quarrels and strifes.
020	PRO	031	001	My words have been spoken by God—the oracular answer of a king, whom his mother instructed.
020	PRO	031	002	What wilt thou keep, my son, what? the words of God. My firstborn son, I speak to thee: what? son of my womb? what? son of my vows?
020	PRO	031	003	Give not thy wealth to women, nor thy mind and living to remorse. Do all things with counsel: drink wine with counsel.
020	PRO	031	004	Princes are prone to anger: let them then not drink wine:
020	PRO	031	005	lest they drink, and forget wisdom, and be not able to judge the poor rightly.
020	PRO	031	006	Give strong drink to those that are in sorrow, and the wine to drink to those in pain:

020	PRO	031	008	Open thy mouth with the word of God, and judge all fairly.
020	PRO	031	009	Open thy mouth and judge justly, and plead the cause of the poor and weak.

020	PRO	031	011	The heart of her husband trusts in her: such a one shall stand in no need of fine spoils.
020	PRO	031	012	For she employs all her living for her husband's good.
020	PRO	031	013	Gathering wool and flax, she makes it serviceable with her hands.
020	PRO	031	014	She is like a ship trading from a distance: so she procures her livelihood.
020	PRO	031	015	And she rises by night, and gives food to her household, and [appointed] tasks to her maidens.
020	PRO	031	016	She views a farm, and buys it: and with the fruit of her hands she plants and a possession.
020	PRO	031	017	She strongly girds her loins, and strengthens her arms for work.
020	PRO	031	018	And she finds by experience that working is good; and her candle goes not out all night.
020	PRO	031	019	She reaches forth her arms to needful [works], and applies her hands to the spindle.
020	PRO	031	020	And she opens her hands to the needy, and reaches out fruit to the poor.
020	PRO	031	021	Her husband is not anxious about those at home when he tarries anywhere abroad: for all her household are clothed.
020	PRO	031	022	She makes for her husband clothes of double texture, and garments for herself of fine linen and scarlet.

020	PRO	031	024	She makes fine linens, and sells girdles to the Chananites: she opens her mouth heedfully and with propriety, and controls her tongue.
020	PRO	031	025	She puts on strength and honour; and rejoices in the last days.
020	PRO	031	026	But she opens her mouth wisely, and according to law.

020	PRO	031	028	And [her] kindness to them sets up her children for them, and they grow rich, and her husband praises her.
020	PRO	031	029	Many daughters have obtained wealth, many have wrought valiantly; but thou hast exceeded, thou hast surpassed all.

# BOOK	021	ECC	Ecclesiastes	Ecclesiastes
021	ECC	001	001	The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king of Israel in Jerusalem.
021	ECC	001	002	Vanity of vanities, said the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is vanity.
021	ECC	001	003	What advantage [is there] to a man in all his labour that he takes under the sun?
021	ECC	001	004	A generation goes, and a generation comes: but the earth stands for ever.
021	ECC	001	005	And the sun arises, and the sun goes down and draws toward its place;
021	ECC	001	006	arising there it proceeds southward, and goes round toward the north. The wind goes round and round, and the wind returns to its circuits.
021	ECC	001	007	All the rivers run into the sea; and yet the sea is not filled: to the place whence the rivers come, thither they return again.
021	ECC	001	008	All things are full of labour; a man will not be able to speak [of them]: neither shall the eye be satisfied with seeing, neither shall the ear be filled with hearing.
021	ECC	001	009	What is that which has been? the very thing which shall be: and what is that which has been done? the very thing which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun.
021	ECC	001	010	[Who is he] that shall speak and say, Behold, this is new? it has already been in the ages that have passed before us.
021	ECC	001	011	There is no memorial to the first things; neither to the things that have been last shall their memorial be with them that shall at the last [time].
021	ECC	001	012	I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.
021	ECC	001	013	And I applied my heart to seek out and examine by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven, for God has given to the sons of men an evil trouble to be troubled therewith.
021	ECC	001	014	I beheld all the works that were wrought under the sun; and, beheld, all were vanity and waywardness of spirit.
021	ECC	001	015	That which is crooked cannot be made straight: and deficiency cannot be numbered.
021	ECC	001	016	I spoke in my heart, saying, Behold, I am increased, and have acquired wisdom beyond all who were before me in Jerusalem: also I applied my heart to know wisdom and knowledge.
021	ECC	001	017	And my heart knew much—wisdom, and knowledge, parables and understanding: I perceived that this also is waywardness of spirit.
021	ECC	001	018	For in the abundance of wisdom is abundance of knowledge; and he that increases knowledge will increase sorrow.
021	ECC	002	001	I said in my heart, Come now, I will prove thee with mirth, and behold thou good: and, behold, this is also vanity.
021	ECC	002	002	I said to laughter, Madness: and to mirth, Why doest thou this:
021	ECC	002	003	And I examined whether my heart would excite my flesh as [with] wine, (though my heart guided [me] in wisdom,) and [I desired] to lay hold of mirth, until I should see of what kind is the good to the sons of men, which they should do under the sun all the days of their life.
021	ECC	002	004	I enlarged my work; I built me houses; I planted me vineyards.
021	ECC	002	005	I made me gardens and orchards, and planted in them every kind of fruit-tree.
021	ECC	002	006	I made me pools of water, to water from them the timber-bearing wood.
021	ECC	002	007	I got servants and maidens, and servants were born to me in the house: also I had abundant possession of flocks and herds, beyond all who were before me in Jerusalem.
021	ECC	002	008	Moreover I collected for myself both silver and gold also, and the peculiar treasures of kings and provinces: I procured me singing men and singing women, and delights of the sons of men, a butler and female cupbearers.
021	ECC	002	009	So I became great, and advanced beyond all that were before in Jerusalem: also my wisdom was established to me.
021	ECC	002	010	And whatever mine eyes desired, I withheld not from them, I withheld not my heart from all my mirth: for my heart rejoiced in all my labour; and this was my portion of all my labour.
021	ECC	002	011	And I looked on all my works which my hands had wrought, and on my labour which I laboured to perform: and behold, all was vanity and waywardness of spirit, and there is no advantage under the sun.
021	ECC	002	012	Then I looked on to see wisdom, and madness, and folly: for who is the man who will follow after counsel, in all things where in he employs it?
021	ECC	002	013	And I saw that wisdom excels folly, as much as light excels darkness.
021	ECC	002	014	The wise man's eyes are in his head; but the fool walks in darkness: and I perceived, even I, that one event shall happen to them all.
021	ECC	002	015	And I said in my heart, As the event of the fool is, so shall it be to me, even to me: and to what purpose have I gained wisdom? I said moreover in my heart, This is also vanity, because the fool speaks of his abundance.
021	ECC	002	016	For there is no remembrance of the wise man with the fool for ever; forasmuch as now [in] the coming days all things are forgotten: and how shall the wise man die with the fool?
021	ECC	002	017	So I hated life; because the work that was wrought under the sun was evil before me: for all is vanity and waywardness of spirit.
021	ECC	002	018	And I hated the whole of my labour which I took under the sun; because I must leave it to the man who will come after me.
021	ECC	002	019	And who knows whether he will be a wise [man] or a fool? and whether he will have power over all my labour in which I laboured, and wherein I grew wise under the sun? this is also vanity.
021	ECC	002	020	so I went about to dismiss from my heart all my labour wherein I had laboured under the sun.
021	ECC	002	021	For there is [such] a man that his labour is in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in fortitude; [yet] this man shall give his portion to one who has not laboured therein. This is also vanity and great evil.
021	ECC	002	022	For it happens to a man in all his labour, and in the purpose of his heart wherein he labours under the sun.
021	ECC	002	023	For all his days [are days] of sorrows, and vexation of spirit is his; in the night also his heart rests not. This is also vanity.
021	ECC	002	024	A man has nothing [really] good to eat, and to drink, and to shew his soul [as] good in his trouble. This also I saw, that it is from the hand of God.
021	ECC	002	025	For who shall eat, or who shall drink, without him?
021	ECC	002	026	For [God] has given to the man who is good in his sight, wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but he has given to the sinner trouble, to add and to heap up, that he may give to him that is good before God; for this is also vanity and waywardness of spirit.
021	ECC	003	001	To all things there is a time, and a season for every matter under heaven.
021	ECC	003	002	A time of birth, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up what has been planted;
021	ECC	003	003	a time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to pull down, and a time to build up;
021	ECC	003	004	a time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to lament, and a time to dance;
021	ECC	003	005	a time to throw stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to abstain from embracing;
021	ECC	003	006	a time to seek, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away;
021	ECC	003	007	a time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to be silent, and a time to speak;
021	ECC	003	008	a time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace.
021	ECC	003	009	What advantage [has] he that works in those things wherein he labours?
021	ECC	003	010	I have seen all the trouble, which God has given to the sons of men to be troubled with.
021	ECC	003	011	All the things which he has made are beautiful in his time: he has also set the whole world in their heart, that man might not find out the work which God has wrought from the beginning even to the end.
021	ECC	003	012	I know that there is no good in them, except [for a man] to rejoice, and to do good in his life.
021	ECC	003	013	Also [in the case of] every man who shall eat and drink, and see good in all his labour, [this] is a gift of God.
021	ECC	003	014	I know that whatsoever things God has done, they shall be for ever: it is impossible to add to it, and it is impossible to take away from it: and God has done [it], that [men] may fear before him.
021	ECC	003	015	That which has been is now; and whatever things [are appointed] to be have already been; and God will seek out that which is past.
021	ECC	003	016	And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, there was the ungodly one; and the place of righteousness, there was the godly one.
021	ECC	003	017	And I said in my heart, God will judge the righteous and the ungodly: for there is a time there for every action and for every work.
021	ECC	003	018	I said in my heart, concerning the speech of the sons of man, God will judge them, and that to shew that they are breasts.
021	ECC	003	019	Also to them is the event of the sons of man, and the event of the brute; one event befalls them: as is the death of the one, so also the death of the other; and there is one breath to all: and what has the man more than the brute? nothing; for all is vanity.
021	ECC	003	020	All [go] to one place; all were formed of the dust, and all will return to dust.
021	ECC	003	021	And who has seen the spirit of the sons of man, whether it goes upward? and the spirit of the beast, whether it goes downward to the earth?
021	ECC	003	022	And I saw that there was no good, but that wherein a man shall rejoice in his works, for it is his portion, for who shall bring him to see any thing of that which shall be after him?
021	ECC	004	001	So I returned, and saw all the oppressions that were done under the sun: and behold the tear of the oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of them that oppressed them was power; but they had no comforter:
021	ECC	004	002	and I praised all the dead that had already died more than the living, as many as are alive until now.
021	ECC	004	003	Better also than both these is he who has not yet been, who has not seen all the evil work that is done under the sun.
021	ECC	004	004	And I saw all labour, and all the diligent work, that this is a man's envy from his neighbour. This is also vanity and waywardness of spirit.
021	ECC	004	005	The fool folds his hands together, and eats his own flesh.
021	ECC	004	006	Better is a handful of rest than two handfuls of trouble and waywardness of spirit.
021	ECC	004	007	So I returned, and saw vanity under the sun.
021	ECC	004	008	There is one [alone], and there is not a second; yea, he has neither son nor brother: yet there is no end to all his labour; neither is his eye satisfied with wealth; and for whom do I labour, and deprive my soul of good? this is also vanity, and an evil trouble.
021	ECC	004	009	Two [are] better than one, [seeing] they have a good reward for their labour.
021	ECC	004	010	For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him that is alone when he falls, and there is not a second to lift him up.
021	ECC	004	011	Also if two should lie together, they also get heat: but how shall one be warmed [alone?]
021	ECC	004	012	And if one should prevail against [him], the two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord shall not be quickly broken.
021	ECC	004	013	Better is a poor and wise child than an old and foolish king, who knows not how to take heed any longer.
021	ECC	004	014	For he shall come forth out of the house of the prisoners to reign, because [he] also that was in his kingdom has become poor.
021	ECC	004	015	I beheld all the living who were walking under the sun, with the second youth who shall stand up in each one's place.
021	ECC	004	016	There is no end to all the people, to all who were before them: and the last shall not rejoice in him: for this also is vanity and waywardness of spirit.
021	ECC	005	001	Keep thy foot, whensoever thou goest to the house of God; and [when thou art] near to hear, let thy sacrifice [be] better than the gift of fools: for they know not that they are doing evil.
021	ECC	005	002	Be not hasty with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be swift to utter anything before God; for God is in heaven above, and thou upon earth: therefore let thy words be few.
021	ECC	005	003	For through the multitude of trial a dream comes; and a fool's voice is with a multitude of words.
021	ECC	005	004	Whenever thou shalt vow a vow to God, defer not to pay it; for [he has] no pleasure in fools: pay thou therefore whatsoever thou shalt have vowed.
021	ECC	005	005	[It is] better that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow and not pay.
021	ECC	005	006	Suffer not thy mouth to lead thy flesh to sin; and say not in the presence of God, It was an error: lest God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the works of thy hands.
021	ECC	005	007	For [there is evil] in a multitude of dreams and vanities and many words: but fear thou God.
021	ECC	005	008	If thou shouldest see the oppression of the poor, and the wresting of judgment and of justice in the land, wonder not at the matter: for [there is] a high one to watch over him that is high, and high ones over them.
021	ECC	005	009	Also the abundance of the earth is for every one: the king [is dependent on] the tilled field.
021	ECC	005	010	He that loves silver shall not be satisfied with silver: and who has loved gain, in the abundance thereof? this is also vanity.
021	ECC	005	011	In the multitude of good they are increased that eat it: and what virtue has the owner, but the right of beholding [it] with his eyes?
021	ECC	005	012	The sleep of a servant is sweet, whether he eat little or much: but to one who is satiated with wealth, there is none that suffers him to sleep.
021	ECC	005	013	There is an infirmity which I have seen under the sun, [namely], wealth kept for its owner to his hurt.
021	ECC	005	014	And that wealth shall perish in an evil trouble: and [the man] begets a son, and there is nothing in his hand.
021	ECC	005	015	As he came forth naked from his mother's womb, he shall return back as he came, and he shall receive nothing for his labour, that it should go [with him] in his hand.
021	ECC	005	016	And this is also an evil infirmity: for as he came, so also shall he return: and what is his gain, for which he vainly labours?
021	ECC	005	017	Yea, all his days are in darkness, and in mourning, and much sorrow, and infirmity, and wrath.
021	ECC	005	018	Behold, I have seen good, that it is a fine thing [for a man] to eat and to drink, and to see good in all his labour in which he may labour under the sun, [all] the number of the days of his life which God has given to him: for it is his portion.
021	ECC	005	019	Yea, and [as for] every man to whom God has given wealth and possessions, and has given him power to eat thereof, and to receive his portion, and to rejoice in his labour; this is the gift of God.
021	ECC	005	020	For he shall not much remember the days of his life; for God troubles him in the mirth of his heart.
021	ECC	006	001	There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it is abundant with man:
021	ECC	006	002	a man to whom God shall give wealth, and substance, and honour, and he wants nothing for his soul of all things that he shall desire, yet God shall not give him power to eat of it, for a stranger shall devour it: this is vanity, and an evil infirmity.
021	ECC	006	003	If a man beget a hundred [children], and live many years, yea, however abundant the days of his years shall be, yet [if] his soul shall not be satisfied with good, and also he have no burial; I said, An untimely birth is better than he.
021	ECC	006	004	For he came in vanity, and departs in darkness, and his name shall be covered in darkness.
021	ECC	006	005	Moreover he has not seen the sun, nor known rest: there is [no more rest] to this one than another.
021	ECC	006	006	Though he has lived to the return of a thousand years, yet he has seen no good: do not all go to one place?
021	ECC	006	007	All the labour of a man is for his mouth, and yet the appetite shall not be satisfied.
021	ECC	006	008	For [what] advantage has the wise man over the fool, since [even] the poor knows how to walk in the direction of life?
021	ECC	006	009	The sight of the eyes is better than that which wanders in soul: this is also vanity, and waywardness of spirit.
021	ECC	006	010	If anything has been, its name has already been called: and it is known what man is; neither can he contend with him who is stronger than he.
021	ECC	006	011	For there are many things which increase vanity.
021	ECC	006	012	What advantage has a man? for who knows [what is] good for a man in his life, [during] the number of the life of the days of his vanity? and he has spent them as a shadow; for who shall tell a man what shall be after him under the sun?
021	ECC	007	001	A good name is better than good oil; and the day of death than the day of birth.
021	ECC	007	002	[It is] better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the banquet house: since this is the end of every man; and the living man will apply good [warning] to his heart.
021	ECC	007	003	Sorrow is better than laughter: for by the sadness of the countenance the heart will be made better.
021	ECC	007	004	The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.
021	ECC	007	005	[It is] better to hear a reproof of a wise man, than for a man to hear the song of fools.
021	ECC	007	006	As the sound of thorns under a caldron, so is the laughter of fools: this is also vanity.
021	ECC	007	007	for oppression makes a wise man mad, and destroys his noble heart.
021	ECC	007	008	The end of a matter is better than the beginning thereof: the patient is better than the high-minded.
021	ECC	007	009	Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger will rest in the bosom of fools.
021	ECC	007	010	Say not, What has happened, that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not enquire in wisdom concerning this.
021	ECC	007	011	Wisdom is good with an inheritance: and [there is] an advantage [by it] to them that see the sun.
021	ECC	007	012	For wisdom in its shadow is as the shadow of silver: and the excellence of the knowledge of wisdom will give life to him that has it.
021	ECC	007	013	Behold the works of God: for who shall be able to straighten him whom God has made crooked?
021	ECC	007	014	In the day of prosperity live joyfully, and consider in the day of adversity: consider, [I say], God also has caused the one to agree with the other for [this] reason, that man should find nothing after him.
021	ECC	007	015	I have seen all things in the days of my vanity: there is a just man perishing in his justice, and there is an ungodly man remaining in his wickedness.
021	ECC	007	016	Be not very just; neither be very wise: lest thou be confounded.
021	ECC	007	017	Be not very wicked; and be not stubborn: lest thou shouldest die before thy time.
021	ECC	007	018	It is well for thee to hold fast by this; also by this defile not thine hand: for to them that fear God all things shall come forth [well].
021	ECC	007	019	Wisdom will help the wise man more than ten mighty men which are in the city.
021	ECC	007	020	For there is not a righteous man in the earth, who will do good, and not sin
021	ECC	007	021	Also take no heed to all the words which ungodly men shall speak; lest thou hear thy servant cursing thee.
021	ECC	007	022	For many times he shall trespass against thee, and repeatedly shall he afflict thine heart; for thus also hast thou cursed others.
021	ECC	007	023	All these things have I proved in wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it was far from me.
021	ECC	007	024	[That which is] far beyond what was, and a great depth, who shall find it out?
021	ECC	007	025	I and my heart went round about to know, and to examine, and to seek wisdom, and the account [of things], and to know the folly and trouble and madness of the ungodly man.
021	ECC	007	026	And I find her [to be], and I will pronounce [to be] more bitter than death the woman which is a snare, and her heart nets, [who has] a band in her hands: [he that is] good in the sight of God shall be delivered from her; but the sinner shall be caught by her.
021	ECC	007	027	Behold, this have I found, said the Preacher, [seeking] by one at a time to find out the account,
021	ECC	007	028	which my soul sought after, but I found not: for I have found one man of a thousand; but a woman in all these I have not found.
021	ECC	007	029	But, behold, this have I found, that God made man upright; but they have sought out many devices.
021	ECC	008	001	Who knows the wise? and who knows the interpretation of a saying? A man's wisdom will lighten his countenance; but a man of shameless countenance will be hated.
021	ECC	008	002	Observe the commandment of the king, and [that] because of the word of the oath of God.
021	ECC	008	003	Be not hasty; thou shalt go forth out of his presence: stand not in an evil matter; for he will do whatsoever he shall please,
021	ECC	008	004	even as a king having power: and who will say to him, What doest thou?
021	ECC	008	005	He that keeps the commandment shall not know an evil thing: and the heart of the wise knows the time of judgment.
021	ECC	008	006	For to every thing there is time and judgment; for the knowledge of a man is great to him.
021	ECC	008	007	For there is no one that knows what is going to be: for who shall tell him how it shall be?
021	ECC	008	008	There is no man that has power over the spirit to retain the spirit; and there is no power in the day of death: and there is no discharge in the day of the battle; neither shall ungodliness save her votary.
021	ECC	008	009	So I saw all this, and I applied my heart to every work that has been done under the sun; all the things wherein man has power over man to afflict him.
021	ECC	008	010	And then I saw the ungodly carried into the tombs, and [that] out of the holy place: and they departed, and were praised in the city, because they had done thus: this also is vanity.
021	ECC	008	011	Because there is no contradiction made on the part of those who do evil quickly, therefore the heart of the children of men is fully determined in them to do evil.
021	ECC	008	012	He that has sinned has done evil from that time, and long from beforehand: nevertheless I know, that it is well with them that fear God, that they may fear before him:
021	ECC	008	013	but it shall not be well with the ungodly, and he shall not prolong his days, [which are] as a shadow; forasmuch as he fears not before God.
021	ECC	008	014	There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there are righteous persons to whom it happens according to the doing of the ungodly; and there are ungodly men, to whom it happens according to the doing of the just: I said, This is also vanity.
021	ECC	008	015	Then I praised mirth, because there is no good for a man under the sun, but to eat, and drink, and be merry: and this shall attend him in his labour all the days of his life, which God has given him under the sun.
021	ECC	008	016	Whereupon I set my heart to know wisdom, and to perceive the trouble that was wrought upon the earth: for there is that neither by day nor night sees sleep with his eyes.
021	ECC	008	017	And I beheld all the works of God, that a man shall not be able to discover the work which is wrought under the sun; whatsoever things a man shall endeavour to seek, however a man may labour to seek it, yet he shall not find it; yea, how much soever a wise man may speak of knowing it, he shall not be able to find it: for I applied all this to my heart, and my heart has seen all this.
021	ECC	009	001	[I saw] that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, are in the hand of God: yea, there is no man that knows either love or hatred, [though] all are before their face.
021	ECC	009	002	Vanity is in all: there is one event to the righteous, and to the wicked; to the good, and to the bad; both to the pure, and to the impure; both to him that sacrifices, and to him that sacrifice not: as is the good, so is the sinner: as is the swearer, even so is he that fears an oath.
021	ECC	009	003	There is this evil in all that is done under the sun, that there is one event to all: yea, the heart of the sons of men is filled with evil, and madness is in their heart during their life, and after that [they go] to the dead.
021	ECC	009	004	for who is he that has fellowship with all the living? there is hope [of him]: for a living dog is better than a dead lion.
021	ECC	009	005	For the living will know that they shall die: but the dead know nothing, and there is no longer any reward to them; for their memory is lost.
021	ECC	009	006	also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, have now perished; yea, there is no portion for them any more for ever in all that is done under the sun.
021	ECC	009	007	Go, eat thy bread with mirth, and drink thy wine with a joyful heart; for now God has favourably accepted thy works.
021	ECC	009	008	Let thy garments be always white; and let not oil be wanting on thine head.
021	ECC	009	009	And see life with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the life of thy vanity, which are given thee under the sun: for that is thy portion in thy life, and in thy labour wherein thou labourest under the sun.
021	ECC	009	010	Whatsoever thine hand shall find to do, do with all thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in Hades wither thou goest.
021	ECC	009	011	I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, nor yet bread to the wise, nor yet wealth to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of knowledge; for time and chance will happen to them all.
021	ECC	009	012	For surely man also knows not his time: as fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as birds that are caught in a snare; even thus the sons of men are snared at an evil time, when it falls suddenly upon them.
021	ECC	009	013	This I also saw [to be] wisdom under the sun, and it is great before me:
021	ECC	009	014	[suppose there were] a little city, and few men in it; and there should come against it a great king, and surround it, and build great mounds against it;
021	ECC	009	015	and should find in it a poor wise man, and he should save the city through his wisdom: yet no man would remember that poor man.
021	ECC	009	016	And I said Wisdom is better than power: yet the wisdom of the poor man is set at nought, and his words not listened to.
021	ECC	009	017	The words of the wise are heard in quiet more than the cry of them that rule in folly.
021	ECC	009	018	Wisdom is better than weapons of war: and one sinner will destroy much good.
021	ECC	010	001	Pestilent flies will corrupt a preparation of sweet ointment: [and] a little wisdom is more precious than great glory of folly.
021	ECC	010	002	A wise man's heart is at his right hand; but a fool's heart at his left.
021	ECC	010	003	Yea, and whenever a fool walks by the way, his heart will fail him, and all that he thinks of is folly.
021	ECC	010	004	If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for soothing will put an end to great offences.
021	ECC	010	005	There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, wherein an error has proceeded from the ruler.
021	ECC	010	006	The fool has been set in very high places, while rich men would sit in a low one.
021	ECC	010	007	I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants on the earth.
021	ECC	010	008	He that digs a pit shall fall into it; and him that breaks down a hedge a serpent shall bite.
021	ECC	010	009	He that removes stones shall be troubled thereby; he that cleaves wood shall be endangered thereby.
021	ECC	010	010	If the axe-head should fall off, then the man troubles his countenance, and he must put forth more strength: and [in that case] skill is of no advantage to a man.
021	ECC	010	011	If a serpent bite when there is no [charmer's] whisper, then there is no advantage to the charmer.
021	ECC	010	012	The words of a wise mouth are gracious: but the lips of a fool will swallow him up.
021	ECC	010	013	The beginning of the words of his mouth is folly: and the end of his talk mischievous madness.
021	ECC	010	014	A fool moreover multiplies words: man knows not what has been, nor what will be: who shall tell him what will come after him?
021	ECC	010	015	The labour of fools will afflict them, [as that of one] who knows not to go to the city.
021	ECC	010	016	Woe to thee, O city, whose king is young, and thy princes eat in the morning!
021	ECC	010	017	Blessed art thou, O land, whose king is a son of nobles, and whose princes shall eat seasonably, for strength, and shall not be ashamed.
021	ECC	010	018	By slothful neglect a building will be brought low: and by idleness of the hands the house will fall to pieces.
021	ECC	010	019	Men prepare bread for laughter, and wine and oil that the living should rejoice: but to money all things will humbly yield obedience.
021	ECC	010	020	Even in thy conscience, curse not the king; and curse not the rich in thy bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry thy voice, and that which has wings shall report thy speech.
021	ECC	011	001	Send forth thy bread upon the face of the water: for thou shalt find it after many days.
021	ECC	011	002	Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for thou knowest not what evil there shall be upon the earth.
021	ECC	011	003	If the clouds be filled with rain, they pour [it] out upon the earth: and if a tree fall southward, or if it fall northward, in the place where the tree shall fall, there it shall be.
021	ECC	011	004	He that observes the wind sows not; and he that looks at the clouds will not reap.
021	ECC	011	005	Among whom none knows what is the way of the wind: as the bones [are hid] in the womb of a pregnant [woman], so thou shalt not know the works of God, [even] all things whatsoever he shall do.
021	ECC	011	006	In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening let not thine hand be slack: for thou knowest not what sort shall prosper, whether this or that, or whether both shall be good alike.
021	ECC	011	007	Moreover the light is sweet, and it is good for the eyes to see the sun.
021	ECC	011	008	For even if a man should live many years, [and] rejoice in them all; yet let him remember the days of darkness; for they shall be many. All that comes is vanity.
021	ECC	011	009	Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thy heart blameless, but not in the sight of thine eyes: yet know that for all these things God will bring thee into judgment.
021	ECC	011	010	Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from thy flesh: for youth and folly are vanity.
021	ECC	012	001	And remember thy Creator in the days of thy youth, before the days of evil come, and the years overtake [thee] in which thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them.
021	ECC	012	002	While the sun and light are not darkened, nor the moon and the stars; nor the clouds return after the rain:
021	ECC	012	003	in the day wherein the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the mighty men shall become bent, and the grinding [women] cease because they have become few, and the [women] looking out at the windows be dark;
021	ECC	012	004	and they shall shut the doors in the market-place, because of the weakness of the voice of her that grinds [at the mill]; and he shall rise up at the voice of the sparrow, and all the daughters of song shall be brought low;
021	ECC	012	005	and they shall look up, and fears [shall be] in the way, and the almond tree shall blossom, and the locust shall increase, and the caper shall be scattered: because man has gone to his eternal home, and the mourners have gone about the market:
021	ECC	012	006	before the silver cord be [let go], or the choice gold be broken, or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel run down to the cistern;
021	ECC	012	007	[before] the dust also return to the earth as it was, and the spirit return to God who gave it.
021	ECC	012	008	Vanity of vanities, said the Preacher; all is vanity.
021	ECC	012	009	And because the Preacher was wise above [others, so it was] that he taught man excellent knowledge, and the ear will trace out the parables.
021	ECC	012	010	The Preacher sought diligently to find out acceptable words, and a correct writing, [even] words of truth.
021	ECC	012	011	The words of the wise are as goads, and as nails firmly fastened, which have been given from one shepherd by agreement.
021	ECC	012	012	And moreover, my son, guard thyself by means of them: of making many books there is no end; and much study is a weariness of the flesh.
021	ECC	012	013	Hear the end of the matter, the sun: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole man.
021	ECC	012	014	For God will bring every work into judgment, with everything that has been overlooked, whether [it be] good, or whether [it be] evil.

# BOOK	022	SOL	Song of Solomon	Song of Songs
022	SOL	001	001	The Song of songs, which is Solomon's.
022	SOL	001	002	Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for thy breasts are better than wine.
022	SOL	001	003	And the smell of thine ointments is better than all spices: thy name is ointment poured forth; therefore do the young maidens love thee.
022	SOL	001	004	They have drawn thee: we will run after thee, for the smell of thine ointments: the king has brought me into closet: let us rejoice and be glad in thee; we will love thy breasts more than wine: righteousness loves thee.
022	SOL	001	005	I am black, but beautiful, ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.
022	SOL	001	006	Look not upon me, because I am dark, because the sun has looked unfavourably upon me: my mother's sons strove with me; they made me keeper in the vineyards; I have not kept my own vineyard.
022	SOL	001	007	Tell me, [thou] whom my soul loves, where thou tendest thy flock, where thou causest [them] to rest at noon, lest I become as one that is veiled by the flocks of thy companions.
022	SOL	001	008	If thou know not thyself, thou fair one among women, go thou forth by the footsteps of the flocks, and feed thy kids by the shepherd's tents.
022	SOL	001	009	I have likened thee, my companion, to my horses in the chariots of Pharao.
022	SOL	001	010	How are thy cheeks beautiful as [those] of a dove, thy neck as chains!
022	SOL	001	011	We will make thee figures of gold with studs of silver.
022	SOL	001	012	So long as the king was at table, my spikenard gave forth its smell.
022	SOL	001	013	My kinsman is to me a bundle of myrrh; he shall lie between my breasts.
022	SOL	001	014	My kinsman is to me a cluster of camphor in the vineyards of Engaddi.
022	SOL	001	015	Behold, thou art fair, my companion; behold, thou art fair; thine eyes are doves.
022	SOL	001	016	Behold, thou art fair, my kinsman, yea, beautiful, overshadowing our bed.
022	SOL	001	017	The beams of our house are cedars, our ceilings are of cypress.
022	SOL	002	001	I am a flower of the plain, a lily of the valleys.
022	SOL	002	002	As a lily among thorns, so is my companion among the daughters.
022	SOL	002	003	As the apple among the trees of the wood, so is my kinsman among the sons. I desired his shadow, and sat down, and his fruit was sweet in my throat.
022	SOL	002	004	Bring me into the wine house; set love before me.
022	SOL	002	005	Strengthen me with perfumes, stay me with apples: for I [am] wounded with love.
022	SOL	002	006	His left [hand shall be] under my head, and his right hand shall embrace me.
022	SOL	002	007	I have charged you, ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the powers and by the virtues of the field, that ye do not rouse or wake [my] love, until he please.
022	SOL	002	008	The voice of my kinsman! behold, he comes leaping over the mountains, bounding over the hills.
022	SOL	002	009	My kinsman is like a roe or a young hart on the mountains of Baethel: behold, he is behind our wall, looking through the windows, peeping through the lattices.
022	SOL	002	010	My kinsman answers, and says to me, Rise up, come, my companion, my fair one, my dove.
022	SOL	002	011	For, behold, the winter is past, the rain is gone, it has departed.
022	SOL	002	012	The flowers are seen in the land; the time of pruning has arrived; the voice of the turtle-dove has been heard in our land.
022	SOL	002	013	The fig-tree has put forth its young figs, the vines put forth the tender grape, they yield a smell: arise, come, my companion, my fair one, my dove; yea, come.
022	SOL	002	014	[Thou art] my dove, in the shelter of the rock, near the wall: shew me thy face, and cause me to hear thy voice; for thy voice is sweet, and thy countenance is beautiful.
022	SOL	002	015	Take us the little foxes that spoil the vines: for our vines put forth tender grapes.
022	SOL	002	016	My kinsman is mine, and I am his: he feeds [his flock] among the lilies.
022	SOL	002	017	Until the day dawn, and the shadows depart, turn, my kinsman, be thou like to a roe or young hart on the mountains of the ravines.
022	SOL	003	001	By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loves: I sought him, but found him not; I called him, but he hearkened not to me.
022	SOL	003	002	I will rise now, and go about in the city, in the market-places, and in the streets, and I will seek him whom my soul loves: I sought him, but I found him not.
022	SOL	003	003	The watchmen who go their rounds in the city found me. [I said], Have ye seen him whom my soul loves?
022	SOL	003	004	[It was] as a little [while] after I parted from them, that I found him whom my soul loves: I held him, and did not let him go, until I brought him into my mother's house, and into the chamber of her that conceived me.
022	SOL	003	005	I have charged you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the powers and by the virtues of the field, that ye rouse not nor awake [my] love, until he please.
022	SOL	003	006	Who is this that comes up from the wilderness as pillars of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all powders of the perfumer?
022	SOL	003	007	Behold Solomon's bed; sixty mighty men of the mighty ones of Israel are round about it.
022	SOL	003	008	They all hold a sword, being expert in war: every man [has] his sword upon his thigh because of fear by night.
022	SOL	003	009	King Solomon made himself a litter of woods of Lebanon.
022	SOL	003	010	He made the pillars of it silver, the bottom of it gold, the covering of it scarlet, in the midst of it a pavement of love, for the daughters of Jerusalem.
022	SOL	003	011	Go forth, ye daughters of Sion, and behold king Solomon, with the crown wherewith his mother crowned him, in the day of his espousals, and in the day of the gladness of his heart.
022	SOL	004	001	Behold, thou art fair, my companion; behold, thou art fair; thine eyes are doves, beside thy veil: thy hair is as flocks of goats, that have appeared from Galaad.
022	SOL	004	002	Thy teeth are as flocks of shorn [sheep], that have gone up from the washing; all of them bearing twins, and there is not a barren one among them.
022	SOL	004	003	Thy lips are as a thread of scarlet, and thy speech is comely: like the rind of a pomegranate is thy cheek without thy veil.
022	SOL	004	004	Thy neck is as the tower of David, that was built for an armoury: a thousand shields hang upon it, [and] all darts of mighty men.
022	SOL	004	005	Thy two breasts are as two twin fawns, that feed among the lilies.
022	SOL	004	006	Until the day dawn, and the shadows depart, I will betake me to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense.
022	SOL	004	007	Thou art all fair, my companion, and there is no spot in thee.
022	SOL	004	008	Come from Libanus, [my] bride, come from Libanus: thou shalt come and pass from the top of Faith, from the top of Sanir and Hermon, from the lions' dens, from the mountains of the leopards.
022	SOL	004	009	My sister, [my] spouse, thou hast ravished my heart; thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, with one chain of thy neck.
022	SOL	004	010	How beautiful are thy breasts, my sister, my spouse! how much more beautiful are thy breasts than wine, and the smell of thy garments than all spices!
022	SOL	004	011	Thy lips drop honeycomb, my spouse: honey and milk are under thy tongue; and the smell of thy garments is as the smell of Libanus.
022	SOL	004	012	My sister, [my] spouse is a garden enclosed; a garden enclosed, a fountain sealed.
022	SOL	004	013	Thy shoots are a garden of pomegranates, with the fruit of choice berries; camphor, with spikenard:
022	SOL	004	014	spikenard and saffron, calamus and cinnamon; with all woods of Libanus, myrrh, aloes, with all chief spices:
022	SOL	004	015	a fountain of a garden, and a well of water springing and gurgling from Libanus.
022	SOL	004	016	Awake, O north wind; and come, O south; and blow through my garden, and let my spices flow out.
022	SOL	005	001	Let my kinsman come down into his garden, and eat the fruit of his choice berries. I am come into my garden, my sister, [my] spouse: I have gathered my myrrh with my spices; I have eaten my bread with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk. Eat, O friends, and drink; yea, brethren, drink abundantly.
022	SOL	005	002	I sleep, but my heart is awake: the voice of my kinsman knocks at the door, [saying], Open, open to me, my companion, my sister, my dove, my perfect one: for my head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night.
022	SOL	005	003	I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet, how shall I defile them?
022	SOL	005	004	My kinsman put forth his hand by the hole [of the door], and my belly moved for him.
022	SOL	005	005	I rose up to open to my kinsman; my hands dropped myrrh, my fingers choice myrrh, on the handles of the lock.
022	SOL	005	006	I opened to my kinsman; my kinsman was gone: my soul failed at his speech: I sought him, but found him not; I called him, but he answered me not.
022	SOL	005	007	The watchman that go their rounds in the city found me, they smote me, they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me.
022	SOL	005	008	I have charged you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the powers and the virtues of the field: if ye should find my kinsman, what are ye to say to him? That I am wounded with love.
022	SOL	005	009	What is thy kinsman [more] than [another] kinsman, O thou beautiful among women? what is thy kinsman [more] than [another] kinsman, that thou hast so charged us?
022	SOL	005	010	My kinsman is white and ruddy, chosen out from myriads.
022	SOL	005	011	His head is [as] very fine gold, his locks are flowing, black as a raven.
022	SOL	005	012	His eyes are as doves, by the pools of waters, washed with milk, sitting by the pools.
022	SOL	005	013	His cheeks are as bowls of spices pouring forth perfumes: his lips are lilies, dropping choice myrrh.
022	SOL	005	014	His hands are as turned gold set with beryl: his belly is an ivory tablet on a sapphire stone.
022	SOL	005	015	His legs are marble pillars set on golden sockets: his form is as Libanus, choice as the cedars.
022	SOL	005	016	His throat is most sweet, and altogether desirable. This is my kinsman, and this is my companion, O daughters of Jerusalem.
022	SOL	006	001	Whither is thy kinsman gone, thou beautiful among women? whither has thy kinsman turned aside? [tell us], and we will seek him with thee.
022	SOL	006	002	My kinsman is gone down to his garden, to the beds of spice, to feed [his flock] in the gardens, and to gather lilies.
022	SOL	006	003	I am my kinsman's, and my kinsman is mine, who feeds among the lilies.
022	SOL	006	004	Thou art fair, my companion, as Pleasure, beautiful as Jerusalem, terrible as [armies] set in array.
022	SOL	006	005	Turn away thine eyes from before me, for they have ravished me: thy hair is as flocks of goats which have appeared from Galaad.
022	SOL	006	006	Thy teeth are as flocks of shorn [sheep], that have gone up from the washing, all of them bearing twins, and there is none barren among them: thy lips are as a thread of scarlet, and thy speech is comely.
022	SOL	006	007	Thy cheek is like the rind of a pomegranate, [being seen] without thy veil.
022	SOL	006	008	There are sixty queens, and eighty concubines, and maidens without number.
022	SOL	006	009	My dove, my perfect one is one; she is the [only] one of her mother; she is the choice of her that bore her. The daughters saw her, and the queens will pronounce her blessed, yea, and the concubines, and they will praise her.
022	SOL	006	010	Who is this that looks forth as the morning, fair as the moon, choice as the sun, terrible as [armies] set in array?
022	SOL	006	011	I went down to the garden of nuts, to look at the fruits of the valley, to see if the vine flowered, [if] the pomegranates blossomed.
022	SOL	006	012	There I will give thee my breasts: my soul knew [it] not: it made me as the chariots of Aminadab.
022	SOL	006	013	Return, return, O Sunamite; return, return, and we will look at thee. What will ye see in the Sunamite? She comes as bands of armies.
022	SOL	007	001	Thy steps are beautiful in shoes, O daughter of the prince: the joints of [thy] thighs are like chains, the work of the craftsman.
022	SOL	007	002	Thy navel is [as] a turned bowl, not wanting liquor; thy belly is [as] a heap of wheat set about with lilies.
022	SOL	007	003	Thy two breasts are as two twin fawns.
022	SOL	007	004	Thy neck is as an ivory tower; thine eyes are as pools in Esebon, by the gates of the daughter of many: thy nose is as the tower of Libanus, looking toward Damascus.
022	SOL	007	005	Thy head upon thee is as Carmel, and the curls of thy hair like scarlet; the king is bound in the galleries.
022	SOL	007	006	How beautiful art thou, and how sweet art thou, [my] love!
022	SOL	007	007	This is thy greatness in thy delights: thou wast made like a palm tree, and thy breasts to cluster.
022	SOL	007	008	I said, I will go up to the palm tree, I will take hold of its high boughs: and now shall thy breasts be as clusters of the vine, and the smell of thy nose of apples;
022	SOL	007	009	and thy throat as good wine, going well with my kinsman, suiting my lips and teeth.
022	SOL	007	010	I am my kinsman's, and his desire is toward me.
022	SOL	007	011	Come, my kinsman, let us go forth into the field; let us lodge in the villages.
022	SOL	007	012	Let us go early into the vineyards; let us see if the vine has flowered, [if] the blossoms have appeared, if the pomegranates have blossomed; there will I give thee my breasts.
022	SOL	007	013	The mandrakes have given a smell, and at our doors [are] all kinds of choice fruits, new and old. O my kinsman, I have kept [them] for thee.
022	SOL	008	001	I would that thou, O my kinsman, wert he that sucked the breasts of my mother; when I found thee without, I would kiss thee; yea, they should not despise me.
022	SOL	008	002	I would take thee, I would bring thee into my mother's house, and into the chamber of her that conceived me; I would make thee to drink of spiced wine, of the juice of my pomegranates.
022	SOL	008	003	His left hand [should be] under my head, and his right hand should embrace me.
022	SOL	008	004	I have charged you, ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the virtues of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake [my] love, until he please.
022	SOL	008	005	Who is this that comes up all white, leaning on her kinsman? I raised thee up under an apple-tree; there thy mother brought thee forth; there she that bore thee brought thee forth.
022	SOL	008	006	Set me as a seal upon thy heart, as a seal upon thine arm; for love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave, her shafts are shafts of fire, [even] the flames thereof.
022	SOL	008	007	Much water will not be able to quench love, and rivers shall not drown it; if a man would give all his substance for love, [men] would utterly despise it.
022	SOL	008	008	Our sister is little, and has no breasts; what shall we do for our sister, in the day wherein she shall be spoken for?
022	SOL	008	009	If she is a wall, let us build upon her silver bulwarks; and if she is a door, let us carve for her cedar panels.
022	SOL	008	010	I am a wall, and my breasts are as towers; I was in their eyes as one that found peace.
022	SOL	008	011	Solomon had a vineyard in Beelamon; he let his vineyard to keepers; every one was to bring for its fruit a thousand [pieces] of silver.
022	SOL	008	012	My vineyard, even mine, is before me; Solomon [shall have] a thousand, and they that keep its fruit two hundred.
022	SOL	008	013	Thou that dwellest in the gardens, the companions hearken to thy voice: make me hear [it].
022	SOL	008	014	Away, my kinsman, and be like a doe or a fawn on the mountains of spices.

# BOOK	023	ISA	Isaiah	Esias
023	ISA	001	001	The vision which Esaias the son of Amos saw, which he saw against Juda, and against Jerusalem, in the reign of Ozias, and Joatham, and Achaz, and Ezekias, who reigned over Judea.
023	ISA	001	002	Hear, O heaven, and hearken, O earth: for the Lord has spoken, [saying], I have begotten and reared up children, but they have rebelled against me.
023	ISA	001	003	The ox knows his owner, and the ass his master's crib: but Israel does not know me, and the people has not regarded me.
023	ISA	001	004	Ah sinful nation, a people full of sins, an evil seed, lawless children: ye have forsaken the Lord, and provoked the Holy One of Israel.
023	ISA	001	005	Why should ye be smitten [any] more, transgressing more and more? the whole head is pained, and the whole heart sad.
023	ISA	001	006	From the feet to the head, there is no soundness in them; neither wound, nor bruise, nor festering ulcer [are healed]: it is not possible to apply a plaister, nor oil, nor bandages.
023	ISA	001	007	Your land is desolate, your cities burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is made desolate, overthrown by strange nations.
023	ISA	001	008	The daughter of Sion shall be deserted as a tent in a vineyard, and as a storehouse of fruits in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.
023	ISA	001	009	And if the Lord of Sabaoth had not left us a seed, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been made like Gomorrha.
023	ISA	001	010	Hear the word of the Lord, ye rulers of Sodoma; attend to the law of God, thou people of Gomorrha.
023	ISA	001	011	Of what [value] to me is the abundance of your sacrifices? saith the Lord: I am full of whole-burnt-offerings of rams; and I delight not in the fat of lambs, and the blood of bulls and goats:
023	ISA	001	012	neither shall ye come [with these] to appear before me; for who has required these things at your hands? Ye shall no more tread my court.
023	ISA	001	013	Though ye bring fine flour, [it is] vain; incense is an abomination to me; I cannot bear your new moons, and your sabbaths, and the great day;
023	ISA	001	014	[your] fasting, and rest from work, your new moons also, and your feasts my soul hates: ye have become loathsome to me; I will no more pardon your sins.
023	ISA	001	015	When ye stretch forth your hands, I will turn away mine eyes from you: and though ye make many supplications, I will not hearken to you; for your hands are full of blood.
023	ISA	001	016	Wash you, be clean; remove your iniquities from your souls before mine eyes; cease from your iniquities;
023	ISA	001	017	learn to do well; diligently seek judgment, deliver him that is suffering wrong, plead for the orphan, and obtain justice for the widow.
023	ISA	001	018	And come, let us reason together, saith the Lord: and though your sins be as purple, I will make them white as snow; and though they be as scarlet, I will make [them] white as wool.
023	ISA	001	019	And if ye be willing, and hearken to me, ye shall eat the good of the land:
023	ISA	001	020	but if ye be not willing, nor hearken to me, a sword shall devour you: for the mouth of the Lord has spoken this.
023	ISA	001	021	How has the faithful city Sion, [once] full of judgment, become a harlot! wherein righteousness lodged, but now murderers.
023	ISA	001	022	Your silver is worthless, thy wine merchants mix the wine with water.
023	ISA	001	023	Thy princes are rebellious, companions of thieves, loving bribes, seeking after rewards; not pleading for orphans, and not heeding the cause of widows.
023	ISA	001	024	Therefore thus saith the Lord, the Lord of hosts, Woe to the mighty [men] of Israel; for my wrath shall not cease against mine adversaries, and I will execute judgment on mine enemies.
023	ISA	001	025	And I will bring my hand upon thee, and purge thee completely, and I will destroy the rebellious, and will take away from thee all transgressors.
023	ISA	001	026	And I will establish thy judges as before, and thy counsellors as at the beginning: and afterward thou shalt be called the city of righteousness, the faithful mother-city of Sion.
023	ISA	001	027	For her captives shall be saved with judgment, and with mercy.
023	ISA	001	028	And the transgressors and the sinners shall be crushed together, and they that forsake the Lord shall be utterly consumed.
023	ISA	001	029	For they shall be ashamed of their idols, which they delighted in, and they are made ashamed of the gardens which they coveted.
023	ISA	001	030	For they shall be as a turpentine tree that has cast its leaves, and as a garden that has no water.
023	ISA	001	031	And their strength shall be as a thread of tow, and their works as sparks, and the transgressors and the sinners shall be burnt up together, and there shall be none to quench [them].
023	ISA	002	001	The word which came to Esaias the son of Amos concerning Judea, and concerning Jerusalem.
023	ISA	002	002	For in the last days the mountain of the Lord shall be glorious, and the house of God [shall be] on the top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall come to it.
023	ISA	002	003	And many nations shall go and say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will tell us his way, and we will walk in it: for out of Sion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord out of Jerusalem.
023	ISA	002	004	And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their swords into plow-shares, and their spears into sickles: and nation shall not take up sword against nation, neither shall they learn to war any more.
023	ISA	002	005	And now, O house of Jacob, come, [and] let us walk in the light of the Lord.
023	ISA	002	006	For he has forsaken his people the house of Israel, because their land is filled as at the beginning with divinations, as the [land] of the Philistines, and many strange children were born to them.
023	ISA	002	007	For their land is filled with silver and gold, and there was no number of their treasures; their land also is filled with horses, and there was no number of chariots.
023	ISA	002	008	And the land is filled with abominations, [even] the works of their hands; and they have worshipped [the works] which their fingers made.
023	ISA	002	009	And the mean man bowed down, and the great man was humbled: and I will not pardon them.
023	ISA	002	010	Now therefore enter ye into the rocks, and hide yourselves in the earth, for fear of the Lord, and by reason of the glory of his might, when he shall arise to strike terribly the earth.
023	ISA	002	011	For the eyes of the Lord are high, but man is low; and the haughtiness of men shall be brought low, and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day.
023	ISA	002	012	For the day of the Lord of hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and haughty, and upon every one that is high and towering, and they shall be brought down;
023	ISA	002	013	and upon every cedar of Libanus, of them that are high and towering, and upon every oak of Basan,
023	ISA	002	014	and upon every high mountain, and upon every high hill,
023	ISA	002	015	and upon every high tower, and upon every high wall,
023	ISA	002	016	and upon every ship of the sea, and upon every display of fine ships.
023	ISA	002	017	And every man shall be brought low, and the pride of men shall fall: and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day.
023	ISA	002	018	And they shall hide all [idols] made with hands,
023	ISA	002	019	having carried [them] into the caves, and into the clefts of the rocks, and into the caverns of the earth, for fear of the Lord, and by reason of the glory of his might, when he shall arise to strike terribly the earth.
023	ISA	002	020	For in that day a man shall cast forth his silver and gold abominations, which they made [in order] to worship vanities and bats;
023	ISA	002	021	to enter into the caverns of the solid rock, and into the clefts of the rocks, for fear of the Lord, and by reason of the glory of his might, when he shall arise to strike terribly the earth.
023	ISA	003	001	Behold now, the Lord, the Lord of hosts, will take away from Jerusalem and from Judea the mighty man and mighty woman, the strength of bread, and the strength of water,
023	ISA	003	002	the great and mighty man, the warrior and the judge, and the prophet, and the counsellor, and the elder,
023	ISA	003	003	the captain of fifty also, and the honourable counsellor, and the wise artificer, and the intelligent hearer.
023	ISA	003	004	And I will make youths their princes, and mockers shall have dominion over them.
023	ISA	003	005	And the people shall fall, man upon man, and [every] man upon his neighbor: the child shall insult the elder man, and the base the honourable.
023	ISA	003	006	For a man shall lay hold of his brother, as one of his father's household, saying, Thou hast raiment, be thou our ruler, and let my meat be under thee.
023	ISA	003	007	And he shall answer in that day, and say, I will not be thy ruler; for I have no bread in my house, nor raiment: I will not be the ruler of this people.
023	ISA	003	008	For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judea has fallen, and their tongues [have spoken] with iniquity, disobedient [as they are] towards the Lord.
023	ISA	003	009	Wherefore now their glory has been brought low, and the shame of their countenance has withstood them, and they have proclaimed their sin as Sodom, and made it manifest.
023	ISA	003	010	Woe to their soul, for they have devised an evil counsel against themselves, saying against themselves, Let us bind the just, for he is burdensome to us: therefore shall they eat the fruits of their works.
023	ISA	003	011	Woe to the transgressor! evils shall happen to him according to the works of his hands.
023	ISA	003	012	O my people, your exactors strip you, and extortioners rule over you: O my people, they that pronounce you blesses lead you astray, and pervert the path of your feet.
023	ISA	003	013	But now the Lord will stand up for judgment, and will enter into judgment with his people.
023	ISA	003	014	The Lord himself shall enter into judgment with the elders of the people, and with their rulers: but why have ye set my vineyard on fire, and [why is] the spoil of the poor in your houses?
023	ISA	003	015	Why do ye wrong my people, and shame the face of the poor?
023	ISA	003	016	Thus saith the Lord, Because the daughters of Sion are haughty, and have walked with an outstretched neck, and with winking of the eyes, and motion of the feet, at the same time drawing their garments in trains, and at the same time sporting with their feet:
023	ISA	003	017	therefore the Lord will humble the chief daughters of Sion, and the Lord will expose their form in that day;
023	ISA	003	018	and the Lord will take away the glory of their raiment, the curls and the fringes, and the crescents,
023	ISA	003	019	and the chains, and the ornaments of their faces,
023	ISA	003	020	and the array of glorious ornaments, and the armlets, and the bracelets, and the wreathed work, and the finger-rings, and the ornaments for the right hand,
023	ISA	003	021	and the ear-rings, and the garments with scarlet borders, and the garments with purple grounds, and the shawls to be worn in the house, and the Spartan transparent dresses, and those made of fine linen, and the purple [ones], and the scarlet [ones], and the fine linen, interwoven with gold and purple, and the light coverings for couches.
023	ISA	003	022	And there shall be instead of a sweet smell, dust; and instead of a girdle, thou shalt gird thyself with a rope; and instead of a golden ornament for the head, thou shalt have baldness on account of thy works; and instead of a tunic with a scarlet ground, thou shalt gird thyself with sackcloth.
023	ISA	003	023	And thy most beautiful son whom thou lovest shall fall by the sword; and your mighty men shall fall by the sword, and shall be brought low.
023	ISA	003	024	And the stores of your ornaments shall mourn, and thou shalt be left alone, and shalt be levelled with the ground.
023	ISA	004	001	And seven women shall take hold of one man, saying, We will eat our own bread, and wear our own raiment: only let thy name be called upon us, [and] take away our reproach.
023	ISA	004	002	And in that day God shall shine gloriously in counsel on the earth, to exalt and glorify the remnant of Israel.
023	ISA	004	003	And it shall be, [that] the remnant left in Sion, and the remnant left in Jerusalem, [even] all that are appointed to life in Jerusalem, shall be called holy.
023	ISA	004	004	For the Lord shall wash away the filth of the sons and daughters of Sion, and shall purge out the blood from the midst of them, with the spirit of judgment, and the spirit of burning.
023	ISA	004	005	And he shall come, and it shall be with regard to every place of mount Sion, yea, all the region round about it shall a cloud overshadow by day, and [there shall be] as it were the smoke and light of fire burning by night: and upon all the glory shall be a defence.
023	ISA	004	006	And it shall be for a shadow from the heat, and as a shelter and a hiding place from inclemency [of weather] and from rain.
023	ISA	005	001	Now I will sing to [my] beloved a song of my beloved concerning my vineyard. [My] beloved had a vineyard on a high hill in a fertile place.
023	ISA	005	002	And I made a hedge round it, and dug a trench, and planted a choice vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and dug a place for the wine-vat in it: and I waited [for it] to bring forth grapes, and it brought forth thorns.
023	ISA	005	003	And now, ye dwellers in Jerusalem, and [every] man of Juda, judge between me and my vineyard.
023	ISA	005	004	What shall I do any more to my vineyard, that I have not done to it? Whereas I expected [it] to bring forth grapes, but it has brought forth thorns.
023	ISA	005	005	And now I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away its hedge, and it shall be for a spoil; and I will pull down its walls, and it shall be [left] to be trodden down.
023	ISA	005	006	And I will forsake my vineyard; and it shall not be pruned, nor dug, and thorns shall come up upon it as on barren land; and I will command the clouds to rain no rain upon it.
023	ISA	005	007	For the vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Juda [his] beloved plant: I expected [it] to bring forth judgment, and it brought forth iniquity; and not righteousness, but a cry.
023	ISA	005	008	Woe [to them] that join house to house, and add field to field, that they may take away something of their neighbor's: will ye dwell alone upon the land?
023	ISA	005	009	For these things have reached the ears of the Lord of hosts: for though many houses should be built, many and fair houses shall be desolate, and there shall be no inhabitants in them.
023	ISA	005	010	For where ten yoke of oxen plough [the land] shall yield one jar-full, and he that sows six homers shall produce three measures.
023	ISA	005	011	Woe [to them] that rise up in the morning, and follow strong drink; who wait [at it till] evening: for the wine shall inflame them.
023	ISA	005	012	For they drink wine with harp, and psaltery, and drums, and pipes: but they regard not the works of the Lord, and consider not the works of his hands.
023	ISA	005	013	Therefore my people have been taken captive, because they know not the Lord: and there has been a multitude of dead [bodies], because of hunger and of thirst for water.
023	ISA	005	014	Therefore hell has enlarged its desire and opened its mouth without ceasing: and her glorious and great, and her rich and her pestilent men shall go down [into it].
023	ISA	005	015	And the mean man shall be brought low, and the great man shall be disgraced, and the lofty eyes shall be brought low.
023	ISA	005	016	But the Lord of hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and the holy God shall be glorified in righteousness.
023	ISA	005	017	And they that were spoiled shall be fed as bulls, and lambs shall feed on the waste places of them that are taken away.
023	ISA	005	018	Woe [to them] that draw sins to them as with a long rope, and iniquities as with a thong of the heifer's yoke:
023	ISA	005	019	who say, Let him speedily hasten what he will do, that we may see [it]: and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel come, that we may know [it].
023	ISA	005	020	Woe [to them] that call evil good, and good evil; who make darkness light, and light darkness; who make bitter sweet, and sweet bitter.
023	ISA	005	021	Woe [to them] that are wise in their own conceit, and knowing in their own sight.
023	ISA	005	022	Woe to the strong [ones] of you that drink wine, and the mighty [ones] that mingle strong drink:
023	ISA	005	023	who justify the ungodly for rewards, and take away the righteousness of the righteous.
023	ISA	005	024	Therefore as stubble shall be burnt by a coal of fire, and shall be consumed by a violent flame, their root shall be as chaff, and their flower shall go up as dust: for they rejected the law of the Lord of hosts, and insulted the word of the Holy One of Israel.
023	ISA	005	025	Therefore the Lord of hosts was greatly angered against his people, and he reached forth his hand upon them, and smote them: and the mountains were troubled, and their carcasses were as dung in the midst of the way: yet for all this his anger has not been turned away, but his hand is yet raised.
023	ISA	005	026	Therefore shall he lift up a signal to the nations that are afar, and shall hiss for them from the end of the earth; and, behold, they are coming very quickly.
023	ISA	005	027	They shall not hunger nor be weary, neither shall they slumber nor sleep; neither shall they loose their girdles from their loins, neither shall their shoe-latchets be broken.
023	ISA	005	028	Whose arrows are sharp, and their bows bent; their horses' hoofs are counted as solid rock: their chariot-wheels are as a storm.
023	ISA	005	029	They rage as lions, and draw nigh as a lion's whelps: and he shall seize, and roar as a wild beast, and he shall cast [them] forth, and there shall be none to deliver them.
023	ISA	005	030	And he shall roar on account of them in that day, as the sound of the swelling sea; and they shall look to the land, and, behold, [there shall be] thick darkness in their perplexity.
023	ISA	006	001	And it came to pass in the year in which king Ozias died, [that] I saw the Lord sitting on a high and exalted throne, and the house was full of his glory.
023	ISA	006	002	And seraphs stood round about him: each one had six wings: and with two they covered [their] face, and with two they covered [their] feet, and with two they flew.
023	ISA	006	003	And one cried to the other, and they said, Holy, holy, holy [is the] Lord of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.
023	ISA	006	004	And the lintel shook at the voice they uttered, and the house was filled with smoke.
023	ISA	006	005	And I said, Woe is me, for I am pricked to the heart; for being a man, and having unclean lips, I dwell in the midst of a people having unclean lips; and I have seen with mine eyes the King, the Lord of hosts.
023	ISA	006	006	And there was sent to me one of the seraphs, and he had in his hand a coal, which he had taken off the altar with the tongs:
023	ISA	006	007	and he touched my mouth, and said, Behold, this has touched thy lips, and will take away thine iniquities, and will purge off thy sins.
023	ISA	006	008	And I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go to this people? And I said, behold, I am [here], send me. And he said, Go, and say to this people,
023	ISA	006	009	Ye shall hear indeed, but ye shall not understand; and ye shall see indeed, but ye shall not perceive.
023	ISA	006	010	For the heart of this people has become gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.
023	ISA	006	011	And I said, How long, O Lord? And he said, Until cities be deserted by reason of their not being inhabited, and the houses by reason of there being no men, and the land shall be left desolate.
023	ISA	006	012	And after this God shall remove the men far off, and they that are left upon the land shall be multiplied.
023	ISA	006	013	And yet there shall be a tenth upon it, and again it shall be for a spoil, as a turpentine tree, and as an acorn when it falls out of its husk.
023	ISA	007	001	And it came to pass in the days of Achaz [the son] of Joatham, the son of Ozias, king of Juda, there came up Rasim king of Aram, and Phakee son of Romelias, king of Israel, against Jerusalem to war against it, but they could not take it.
023	ISA	007	002	And a message was brought to the house of David, saying, Aram has conspired with Ephraim. And his soul was amazed, and the soul of his people, as in a wood a tree is moved by the wind.
023	ISA	007	003	And the Lord said to Esaias, Go forth to meet Achaz, thou, and thy son Jasub who is left, to the pool of the upper way of the fuller's field.
023	ISA	007	004	And thou shalt say to him, Take care to be quiet, and fear not, neither let thy soul be disheartened because of these two smoking firebrands: for when my fierce anger is over, I will heal again.
023	ISA	007	005	And [as for] the son of Aram, and the son of Romelias, forasmuch as they have devised an evil counsel, [saying],
023	ISA	007	006	We will go up against Judea, and having conferred with them we will turn them away to our side, and we will make the son of Tabeel king of it;
023	ISA	007	007	thus saith the Lord of hosts, This counsel shall not abide, nor come to pass.
023	ISA	007	008	But the head of Aram is Damascus, and the head of Damascus, Rasim; and yet within sixty and five years the kingdom of Ephraim shall cease from [being] a people.
023	ISA	007	009	And the head of Ephraim is Somoron, and the head of Somoron the son of Romelias: but if ye believe not, neither will ye at all understand.
023	ISA	007	010	And the Lord again spoke to Achaz, saying,
023	ISA	007	011	Ask for thyself a sign of the Lord thy God, in the depth or in the height.
023	ISA	007	012	And Achaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the Lord.
023	ISA	007	013	And he said, Hear ye now, O house of David; is it a little thing for you to contend with men? and how do ye contend against the Lord?
023	ISA	007	014	Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; behold, a virgin shall conceive in the womb, and shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Emmanuel.
023	ISA	007	015	Butter and honey shall he eat, before he knows either to prefer evil [or] choose the good.
023	ISA	007	016	For before the child shall know good or evil, he refuses evil, to choose the good; and the land shall be forsaken which thou art afraid of because of the two kings.
023	ISA	007	017	But God shall bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon the house of thy father, days which have never come, from the day that Ephraim took away from Juda the king of the Assyrians.
023	ISA	007	018	And it shall come to pass in that day that the Lord shall hiss for the flies, which [insect] shall rule over a part of the river of Egypt, and for the bee which is in the land of the Assyrians.
023	ISA	007	019	And they all shall enter into the clefts of the land, and into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves, and into every ravine.
023	ISA	007	020	In that day the Lord shall shave with the hired razor of the king of Assyria beyond the river the head, and the hairs of the feet, and will remove the beard.
023	ISA	007	021	And it shall come to pass in that day, [that] a man shall rear a heifer, and two sheep.
023	ISA	007	022	And it shall come to pass from their drinking an abundance of milk, [that] every one that is left on the land shall eat butter and honey.
023	ISA	007	023	And it shall come to pass in that day, [for] every place where there shall be a thousand vines at a thousand shekels, they shall become barren land and thorns.
023	ISA	007	024	[Men] shall enter thither with arrow and bow; for all the land shall be [barren] ground and thorns.
023	ISA	007	025	And every mountain shall be certainly ploughed: there shall no fear come thither: for there shall be from [among] the [barren] ground and thorns that whereon cattle shall feed and oxen shall tread.
023	ISA	008	001	And the Lord said to me, Take to thyself a volume of a great new [book], and write in it with a man's pen concerning the making a rapid plunder of spoils; for it is near at hand.
023	ISA	008	002	And make me witnesses [of] faithful men, Urias, and Zacharias the son of Barachias.
023	ISA	008	003	And I went in to the prophetess; and she conceived, and bore a son. And the Lord said to me, Call his name, Spoil quickly, plunder speedily.
023	ISA	008	004	For before the child shall know [how] to call [his] father or [his] mother, [one] shall take the power of Damascus and the spoils of Samaria before the king of the Assyrians.
023	ISA	008	005	And the Lord spoke to me yet again, [saying],
023	ISA	008	006	Because this people chooses not the water of Siloam that goes softly, but wills to have Rassin, and the son of Romelias [to be] king over you;
023	ISA	008	007	therefore, behold, the Lord brings up upon you the water of the river, strong and abundant, [even] the king of the Assyrians, and his glory: and he shall come up over every valley of yours, and shall walk over every wall of yours:
023	ISA	008	008	and he shall take away from Juda [every] man who shall be able to lift up his head, [and every one] able to accomplish anything; and his camp shall fill the breadth of thy land, [O] God with us.
023	ISA	008	009	Know, ye Gentiles, and be conquered; hearken ye, even to the extremity of the earth: be conquered, after ye strengthened yourselves; for even if ye should again strengthen yourselves, ye shall again be conquered.
023	ISA	008	010	And whatsoever counsel ye shall take, the Lord shall bring it to nought; and whatsoever word ye shall speak, it shall not stand among you: for God is with us.
023	ISA	008	011	Thus saith the Lord, With a strong hand they revolt from the course of the way of this people, saying,
023	ISA	008	012	Let them not say, [It is] hard, for whatsoever this people says, is hard: but fear not ye their fear, neither be dismayed.
023	ISA	008	013	Sanctify ye the Lord himself; and he shall be thy fear.
023	ISA	008	014	And if thou shalt trust in him, he shall be to thee for a sanctuary; and ye shall not come against [him] as against a stumbling-stone, neither as against the falling of a rock: but the houses of Jacob are in a snare, and the dwellers in Jerusalem in a pit.
023	ISA	008	015	Therefore many among them shall be weak, and fall, and be crushed; and they shall draw nigh, and men shall be taken securely.
023	ISA	008	016	Then shall those who seal themselves that they may not learn the law be made manifest.
023	ISA	008	017	And [one] shall say, I will wait for God, who has turned away his face from the house of Jacob, and I will trust in him.
023	ISA	008	018	Behold I and the children which God has given me: and they shall be [for] signs and wonders in the house of Israel from the Lord of hosts, who dwells in mount Sion.
023	ISA	008	019	And if they should say to you, Seek those who have in them a divining spirit, and them that speak out of the earth, them that speak vain words, who speak out of their belly: shall not a nation diligently seek to their God? why do they seek to the dead concerning the living?
023	ISA	008	020	For he has given the law for a help, that they should not speak according to this word, concerning which there are no gifts to give for it.
023	ISA	008	021	And famine shall come sorely upon you, and it shall come to pass, [that] when ye shall be hungry, ye shall be grieved, and ye shall speak ill of the prince and your fathers' ordinances: and they shall look up to heaven above,
023	ISA	008	022	and they shall look on the earth below, and behold severe distress, and darkness, affliction, and anguish, and darkness so that [one cannot] see; and he that is in anguish shall not be distressed only for a time.
023	ISA	009	001	Drink this first. Act quickly, O land of Zabulon, land of Nephthalim, and the rest [inhabiting] the sea-coast, and [the land] beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles.
023	ISA	009	002	O people walking in darkness, behold a great light: ye that dwell in the region [and] shadow of death, a light shall shine upon you.
023	ISA	009	003	The multitude of the people which thou hast brought down in thy joy, they shall even rejoice before thee as they that rejoice in harvest, and as they that divide the spoil.
023	ISA	009	004	Because the yoke that was laid upon them has been taken away, and the rod that was on their neck: for he has broken the rod of the exactors, as in the day of Madiam.
023	ISA	009	005	For they shall compensate for every garment that has been acquired by deceit, and [all] raiment with restitution; and they shall be willing, [even] if they were burnt with fire.
023	ISA	009	006	For a child is born to us, and a son is given to us, whose government is upon his shoulder: and his name is called the Messenger of great counsel: for I will bring peace upon the princes, and health to him.
023	ISA	009	007	His government shall be great, and of his peace there is no end: [it shall be] upon the throne of David, and [upon] his kingdom, to establish it, and to support [it] with judgment and with righteousness, from henceforth and forever. The seal of the Lord of hosts shall perform this.
023	ISA	009	008	The Lord has sent death upon Jacob, and it has come upon Israel.
023	ISA	009	009	And all the people of Ephraim, and they that dwelt in Samaria shall know, who say in their pride and lofty heart,
023	ISA	009	010	The bricks are fallen down, but come, let us hew stones, and cut down sycamores and cedars, and let us build for ourselves a tower.
023	ISA	009	011	And God shall dash down them that rise up against him on mount Sion, and shall scatter his enemies;
023	ISA	009	012	[even] Syria from the rising of the sun, and the Greeks from the setting of the sun, who devour Israel with open mouth. For all this [his] anger is not turned away, but still [his] hand is exalted.
023	ISA	009	013	But the people turned not until they were smitten, and they sought not the Lord.
023	ISA	009	014	So the Lord took away from Israel the head and tail, great and small, in one day:
023	ISA	009	015	the old man, and them that respect persons, this is the head; and the prophet teaching unlawful things, he is the tail.
023	ISA	009	016	And they that pronounce this people blessed shall mislead them; and they mislead them that they may devour them.
023	ISA	009	017	Therefore the Lord shall not take pleasure in their young men, neither shall he have pity on their orphans or on their widows: for they are all transgressors and wicked, and every mouth speaks unjustly. For all this [his] anger is not turned away, but [his] hand is yet exalted.
023	ISA	009	018	And iniquity shall burn as fire, and shall be devoured by fire as dry grass: and it shall burn in the thickets of the wood, and shall devour all that is round about the hills.
023	ISA	009	019	The whole earth is set on fire because of the fierce anger of the Lord, and the people shall be as men burnt by fire: no man shall pity his brother.
023	ISA	009	020	But [one] shall turn aside to the right hand, for he shall be hungry; and shall eat on the left, and a man shall by no means be satisfied with eating the flesh of his own arm.
023	ISA	009	021	For Manasses shall eat [the flesh] of Ephraim, and Ephraim [the flesh] of Manasses; for they shall besiege Juda together. For all this [his] anger is not turned away, but [his] hand is yet exalted.
023	ISA	010	001	Woe to them that write wickedness; for when they write they do write wickedness,
023	ISA	010	002	perverting the cause of the poor, violently wresting the judgment of the needy ones of my people, that the widow may be a prey to them, and the orphan a spoil.
023	ISA	010	003	And what will they do in the day of visitation? for affliction shall come to you from afar: and to whom will ye flee for help? and where will ye leave your glory,
023	ISA	010	004	that ye may not fall into captivity? For all this [his] wrath is not turned away, but [his] hand is yet exalted.
023	ISA	010	005	Woe to the Assyrians; the rod of my wrath, and anger are in their hands.
023	ISA	010	006	I will send my wrath against a sinful nation, and I will charge my people to take plunder and spoil, and to trample the cities, and to make them dust.
023	ISA	010	007	But he meant not thus, neither did he devise thus in his soul: but his mind shall change, and [that] to destroy nations not a few.
023	ISA	010	008	And if they should say to him, Thou alone art ruler;
023	ISA	010	009	then shall he say, Have I not taken the country above Babylon and Chalanes, where the tower was built? and have I [not] taken Arabia, and Damascus, and Samaria?
023	ISA	010	010	As I have taken them, I will also take all the kingdoms: howl, ye idols in Jerusalem, and in Samaria.
023	ISA	010	011	For as I did to Samaria and her idols, so will I do also to Jerusalem and her idols.
023	ISA	010	012	And it shall come to pass, when the Lord shall have finished doing all things on Mount Sion and Jerusalem, [that] I will visit upon the proud heart, [even] upon the ruler of the Assyrians, and upon the boastful haughtiness of his eyes.
023	ISA	010	013	For he said, I will act in strength, and in the wisdom of [my] understanding I will remove the boundaries of nations, and will spoil their strength.
023	ISA	010	014	And I will shake the inhabited cities: and I will take with my hand all the world as a nest: and I will even take them as eggs that have been left; and there is none that shall escape me, or contradict me.
023	ISA	010	015	Shall the axe glorify itself without him that hews with it? or shall the saw lift up itself without him that uses it, as if one should lift a rod or staff? but it shall not be so;
023	ISA	010	016	but the Lord of hosts shall send dishonour upon thine honour, and burning fire shall be kindled upon thy glory.
023	ISA	010	017	And the light of Israel shall be for a fire, and he shall sanctify him with burning fire, and it shall devour the wood as grass.
023	ISA	010	018	In that day the mountains shall be consumed, and the hills, and the forests, and [fire] shall devour [both] soul and body: and he that flees shall be as one fleeing from burning flame.
023	ISA	010	019	And they that are left of them shall be a [small] number, and a child shall write them.
023	ISA	010	020	And it shall come to pass in that day [that] the remnant of Israel shall no more join themselves with, and the saved of Jacob shall no more trust in, them that injured them; but they shall trust in the Holy God of Israel, in truth.
023	ISA	010	021	And the remnant of Jacob shall [trust] on the mighty God.
023	ISA	010	022	And though the people of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant of them shall be saved.
023	ISA	010	023	He will finish the work, and cut it short in righteousness: because the Lord will make a short work in all the world.
023	ISA	010	024	Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts, Be not afraid, my people who dwell in Sion, of the Assyrians, because he shall smite thee with a rod: for I am bringing a stroke upon thee, that [thou] mayest see the way of Egypt.
023	ISA	010	025	For yet a little while, and the indignation shall cease: but my wrath shall be against their council.
023	ISA	010	026	And God will stir up [enemies] against them, according to the stroke of Madiam in the place of affliction: and his wrath shall be by the way of the sea, [even] to the way that leads to Egypt.
023	ISA	010	027	And it shall come to pass in that day, [that] his yoke shall be taken away from thy shoulder, and his fear from thee, and the yoke shall be destroyed from off your shoulders.
023	ISA	010	028	For he shall arrive at the city of Angai, and shall pass on to Maggedo, and shall lay up his stores in Machmas.
023	ISA	010	029	And he shall pass by the valley, and shall arrive at Angai: fear shall seize upon Rama, the city of Saul.
023	ISA	010	030	The daughter of Gallim shall flee; Laisa shall hear; one shall hear in Anathoth.
023	ISA	010	031	Madebena also is amazed, and the inhabitants of Gibbir.
023	ISA	010	032	Exhort ye [them] to-day to remain in the way: exhort ye [beckoning] with the hand the mountain, the daughter of Sion, even ye hills that are in Jerusalem.
023	ISA	010	033	Behold, the Lord, the Lord of hosts, will mightily confound the glorious ones; and the haughty in pride shall be crushed, and the lofty shall be brought low:
023	ISA	010	034	and the lofty ones shall fall by the sword, and the Libanus shall fall with his lofty ones.
023	ISA	011	001	And there shall come forth a rod out of the root of Jesse, and a blossom shall come up from [his] root:
023	ISA	011	002	and the Spirit of God shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and strength, the spirit of knowledge and godliness shall fill him;
023	ISA	011	003	the spirit of the fear of God. He shall not judge according to appearance, nor reprove according to report:
023	ISA	011	004	but he shall judge the cause of the lowly, and shall reprove the lowly of the earth: and he shall smite the earth with the word of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he destroy the ungodly one.
023	ISA	011	005	And he shall have his loins girt with righteousness, and his sides clothed with truth.
023	ISA	011	006	And the wolf shall feed with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the young calf and bull and lion shall feed together; and a little child shall lead them.
023	ISA	011	007	And the ox and bear shall feed together; and their young shall be together: and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.
023	ISA	011	008	And an infant shall put his hand on the holes of asps, and on the nest of young asps.
023	ISA	011	009	And they shall not hurt, nor shall they at all be able to destroy any one on my holy mountain: for the whole [world] is filled with the knowledge of the Lord, as much water covers the seas.
023	ISA	011	010	And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, and he that shall arise to rule over the Gentiles; in him shall the Gentiles trust, and his rest shall be glorious.
023	ISA	011	011	And it shall be in that day, [that] the Lord shall again shew his hand, to be zealous for the remnant that is left of the people, which shall be left by the Assyrians, and [that] from Egypt, and from the country of Babylon, and from Ethiopia, and from the Elamites, and from the rising of the sun, and out of Arabia.
023	ISA	011	012	And he shall lift up a standard for the nations, and he shall gather the lost ones of Israel, and he shall gather the dispersed of Juda from the four corners of the earth.
023	ISA	011	013	And the envy of Ephraim shall be taken away, and the enemies of Juda shall perish: Ephraim shall not envy Juda, and Juda shall not afflict Ephraim.
023	ISA	011	014	And they shall fly in the ships of the Philistines: they shall at the same time spoil the sea, and them [that come] from the east, and Idumea: and they shall lay their hands on Moab first; but the children of Ammon shall first obey [them.]
023	ISA	011	015	And the Lord shall make desolate the sea of Egypt; and he shall lay his hand on the river with a strong wind, and he shall smite the seven channels, so that men shall pass through it dry-shod.
023	ISA	011	016	And there shall be a passage for my people that is left in Egypt: and it shall be to Israel as the day when he came forth out of the land of Egypt.
023	ISA	012	001	And in that day thou shalt say, I [will] bless thee, O Lord; for thou wast angry with me, but thou hast turned aside thy wrath, and hast pitied me.
023	ISA	012	002	Behold, my God is my Saviour; I will trust in him, and not be afraid: for the Lord is my glory and my praise, and is become my salvation.
023	ISA	012	003	Draw ye therefore water with joy out of the wells of salvation.
023	ISA	012	004	And in that day thou shalt say, sing to the Lord, call aloud upon his name, proclaim his glorious [deeds] among the Gentiles; make mention that his name is exalted.
023	ISA	012	005	Sing praise to the name of the Lord; for he has done great [things]: declare this in all the earth.
023	ISA	012	006	Exalt and rejoice, ye that dwell in Sion: for the Holy One of Israel is exalted in the midst of her.
023	ISA	013	001	THE VISION WHICH ESAIAS SON OF AMOS SAW AGAINST BABYLON.
023	ISA	013	002	Lift up a standard on the mountain of the plain, exalt the voice to them, beckon with the hand, open [the gates], ye rulers.
023	ISA	013	003	I give command, and I bring them: giants are coming to fulfil my wrath, rejoicing at the same time and insulting.
023	ISA	013	004	A voice of many nations on the mountains, [even] like [to that] of many nations; a voice of kings and nations gathered together: the Lord of hosts has given command to a war-like nation,
023	ISA	013	005	to come from a land afar off, from the utmost foundation of heaven; the Lord and his warriors [are coming] to destroy all the world.
023	ISA	013	006	Howl ye, for the day of the Lord is near, and destruction from God shall arrive.
023	ISA	013	007	Therefore every hand shall become powerless, and every soul of man shall be dismayed.
023	ISA	013	008	The elders shall be troubled, and pangs shall seize them, as of a woman in travail: and they shall mourn one to another, and shall be amazed, and shall change their countenance as a flame.
023	ISA	013	009	For behold! the day of the Lord is coming which cannot be escaped, [a day] of wrath and anger, to make the world desolate, and to destroy sinners out of it.
023	ISA	013	010	For the stars of heaven, and Orion, and all the host of heaven, shall not give their light; and it shall be dark at sunrise, and the moon shall not give her light.
023	ISA	013	011	And I will command evils for the whole world, and [will visit] their sins on the ungodly: and I will destroy the pride of transgressors, and will bring low the pride of the haughty.
023	ISA	013	012	And they that are left shall be more precious than gold tried in the fire; and a man shall be more precious than the stone that is in Suphir.
023	ISA	013	013	For the heaven shall be enraged, and the earth shall be shaken from her foundation, because of the fierce anger of the Lord of hosts, in the day in which his wrath shall come on.
023	ISA	013	014	And they that are left shall be as a fleeing fawn, and as a stray sheep, and there shall be none to gather [them]: so that a man shall turn back to his people, and a man shall flee to his own land.
023	ISA	013	015	For whosoever shall be taken shall be overcome; and they that are gathered together shall fall by the sword.
023	ISA	013	016	And they shall dash their children before their eyes; and they shall spoil their houses, and shall take their wives.
023	ISA	013	017	Behold, I will stir up against you the Medes, who do not regard silver, neither have they need of gold.
023	ISA	013	018	They shall break the bows of the young men; and they shall have no mercy on your children; nor shall their eyes spare thy children.
023	ISA	013	019	And Babylon, which is called glorious by the king of the Chaldeans, shall be as [when] God overthrew Sodoma, and Gomorrha.
023	ISA	013	020	It shall never be inhabited, neither shall any enter into it for many generations: neither shall the Arabians pass through it; nor shall shepherds at all rest in it.
023	ISA	013	021	But wild beasts shall rest there; and the houses shall be filled with howling; and monsters shall rest there, and devils shall dance there, and satyrs shall dwell there; and hedgehogs shall make their nests in their houses. It will come soon, and will not tarry.
023	ISA	014	001	And the Lord will have mercy on Jacob, and will yet choose Israel, and they shall rest on their land: and the stranger shall be added to them, yea, shall be added to the house of Jacob.
023	ISA	014	002	And the Gentiles shall take them, and bring them into their place: and they shall inherit them, and they shall be multiplied upon the land for servants and handmaidens: and they that took them captives shall become captives [to them]; and they that had lordship over them shall be under [their] rule.
023	ISA	014	003	And it shall come to pass in that day, [that] the Lord shall give thee rest from thy sorrow and vexation, [and from] thy hard servitude wherein thou didst serve them.
023	ISA	014	004	And thou shalt take up this lamentation against the king of Babylon, How has the extortioner ceased, and the taskmaster ceased!
023	ISA	014	005	The Lord has broken the yoke of sinners, the yoke of princes.
023	ISA	014	006	Having smitten a nation in wrath, with an incurable plague, smiting a nation with a wrathful plague, which spared [them] not, he rested in quiet.
023	ISA	014	007	All the earth cries aloud with joy:
023	ISA	014	008	the trees also of Libanus rejoice against thee, and the cedar of Libanus, [saying], From the time that thou hast been laid low, no one has come up to cut us down.
023	ISA	014	009	Hell from beneath is provoked to meet thee: all the great ones that have ruled over the earth have risen up together against thee, they that have raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations.
023	ISA	014	010	All shall answer and say to thee, Thou also hast been taken, even as we; and thou art numbered amongst us.
023	ISA	014	011	Thy glory has come down to Hades, and thy great mirth: under thee they shall spread corruption, and the worm shall be thy covering.
023	ISA	014	012	How has Lucifer, that rose in the morning, fallen from heaven! He that sent [orders] to all the nations is crushed to the earth.
023	ISA	014	013	But thou saidst in thine heart, I will go up to heaven, I will set my throne above the stars of heaven: I will sit on a lofty mount, on the lofty mountains toward the north:
023	ISA	014	014	I will go up above the clouds: I will be like the Most High.
023	ISA	014	015	But now thou shalt go down to hell, even to the foundations of the earth.
023	ISA	014	016	They that see thee shall wonder at thee, and say, This is the man that troubled the earth, that made kings to shake;
023	ISA	014	017	that made the whole world desolate, and destroyed its cities; he loosed not those who were in captivity.
023	ISA	014	018	All the kings of the nations lie in honour, [every] man in his house.
023	ISA	014	019	But thou shalt be cast forth on the mountains, as a loathed carcase, with many dead who have been pierced with swords, going down to the grave.
023	ISA	014	020	As a garment defiled with blood shall not be pure, so neither shalt thou be pure; because thou hast destroyed my land, and hast slain my people: thou shalt not endure for ever, —[thou] an evil seed.
023	ISA	014	021	Prepare thy children to be slain for the sins of their father; that they arise not, and inherit the earth, nor fill the earth with wars.
023	ISA	014	022	And I will rise up against them, saith the Lord of hosts, and I will destroy their name, and remnant, and seed: thus saith the Lord.
023	ISA	014	023	And I will make the region of Babylon desert, so that hedgehogs shall dwell [there], and it shall come to nothing: and I will make it a pit of clay for destruction.
023	ISA	014	024	Thus saith the Lord of hosts, As I have said, so it shall be: and as I have purposed, so [the matter] shall remain:
023	ISA	014	025	[even] to destroy the Assyrians upon my land, and upon my mountains: and they shall be for trampling; and their yoke shall be taken away from them, and their glory shall be taken away from their shoulders.
023	ISA	014	026	This is the purpose which the Lord has purposed upon the whole earth: and this the hand that is uplifted against all the nations.
023	ISA	014	027	For what the Holy God has purposed, who shall frustrate? and who shall turn back his uplifted hand?
023	ISA	014	028	In the year in which king Achaz died this word came.
023	ISA	014	029	Rejoice not, all ye Philistines, because the yoke of him that smote you is broken: for out of the seed of the serpent shall come forth the young asps, and their young shall come forth flying serpents,
023	ISA	014	030	And the poor shall be fed by him, and poor men shall rest in peace: but he shall destroy thy seed with hunger, and shall destroy thy remnant.
023	ISA	014	031	Howl, ye gates of cities; let the cities be troubled and cry, [even] all the Philistines: for smoke is coming from the north, and there is no [possibility] of living.
023	ISA	014	032	And what shall the kings of the nations answer? That the Lord has founded Sion, and by him the poor of the people shall be saved.
023	ISA	015	001	THE WORD AGAINST THE LAND OF MOAB. By night the land of Moab shall be destroyed; for by night the wall of the land of Moab shall be destroyed.
023	ISA	015	002	Grieve for yourselves; for even Debon, where your altar is, shall be destroyed: thither shall ye go up to weep, over Nabau of the land of Moab: howl ye: baldness shall be on every head, [and] all arms [shall be] wounded.
023	ISA	015	003	Gird yourselves with sackcloth in her streets: and lament upon her roofs, and in her streets, and in her ways; howl all of you with weeping.
023	ISA	015	004	For Esebon and Eleale have cried: their voice was heard to Jassa: therefore the loins of the region of Moab cry aloud; her soul shall know.
023	ISA	015	005	The heart of the region of Moab cries within her to Segor; for it is [as] a heifer of three years old: and on the ascent of Luith they shall go up to thee weeping by the way of Aroniim: she cries, Destruction, and trembling.
023	ISA	015	006	The water of Nemerim shall be desolate, and the grass thereof shall fail: for there shall be no green grass.
023	ISA	015	007	Shall [Moab] even thus be delivered? for I [will] bring the Arabians upon the valley, and they shall take it.
023	ISA	015	008	For the cry has reached the border of the region of Moab, [even] of Agalim; and her howling [has gone] as far as the well of Aelim.
023	ISA	015	009	And the water of Dimon shall be filled with blood: for I will bring Arabians upon Dimon, and I will take away the seed of Moab, and Ariel, and the remnant of Adama.
023	ISA	016	001	I will send as it were reptiles on the land: is [not] the mount of the daughter of Sion a desolate rock?
023	ISA	016	002	For thou shalt be as a young bird taken away from a bird that has flown: [even] thou shalt be [so], daughter of Moab: and then do thou, O Arnon,
023	ISA	016	003	take farther counsel, and continually make thou a shelter from grief: they flee in darkness at mid-day; they are amazed; be not thou led captive.
023	ISA	016	004	The fugitives of Moab shall sojourn with thee; they shall be to you a shelter from the face of the pursuer: for thine alliance has been taken away, and the oppressing ruler has perished from off the earth.
023	ISA	016	005	And a throne shall be established with mercy; and one shall sit upon it with truth in the tabernacle of David, judging, and earnestly seeking judgments, and hasting righteousness.
023	ISA	016	006	We have heard of the pride of Moab; he is very proud. I have cut off his pride: thy prophecy shall not be thus, [no] not thus.
023	ISA	016	007	Moab shall howl; for all shall howl in the land of Moab: but thou shalt care for them that dwell in Seth, and thou shalt not be ashamed.
023	ISA	016	008	The plains of Esebon shall mourn, the vine of Sebama: swallowing up the nations, trample ye her vines, even to Jazer: ye shall not come together; wander ye in the desert: they that were sent are deserted, for they have gone over to the sea.
023	ISA	016	009	Therefore will I weep as with the weeping of Jazer for the vine of Sebama; Esebon and Eleale have cast down thy trees; for I will trample on thy harvest and on thy vintages, and all [thy plants] shall fall.
023	ISA	016	010	And gladness and rejoicing shall be taken away from the vineyards; and they shall not at all tread wine into the vats; for [the vintage] has ceased.
023	ISA	016	011	Therefore my belly shall sound as a harp for Moab, and thou hast repaired my inward parts as a wall.
023	ISA	016	012	And it shall be to thy shame, (for Moab is wearied at the altars,) that he shall go in to the idols thereof to pray, but they shall not be at all able to deliver him.
023	ISA	016	013	This is the word which the Lord spoke against Moab, when he spoke.
023	ISA	016	014	And now I say, in three years, of the years of an hireling, the glory of Moab shall be dishonoured [with] all his great wealth; and he shall be left few in number, and not honoured.
023	ISA	017	001	THE WORD AGAINST DAMASCUS. Behold, Damascus shall be taken away from among cities, and shall become a ruin;
023	ISA	017	002	abandoned for ever, to [be] a fold and resting-place for flocks, and there shall be none to go after them.
023	ISA	017	003	And she shall no longer be a strong place for Ephraim to flee to, and there shall no longer be a kingdom in Damascus, or a remnant of Syrians; for thou art no better than the children of Israel, [even] than their glory; thus saith the Lord of hosts.
023	ISA	017	004	There shall be in that day a failure of the glory of Jacob, and the riches of his glory shall be shaken.
023	ISA	017	005	And it shall be as if one should gather standing corn, and reap the grain of the ears; and it shall be as if one should gather ears in a rich valley;
023	ISA	017	006	and [as if] there should be left stubble therein, or [as it were] the berries of an olive tree, two or three on the topmost bough, or [as if] four or five should be left on their branches; thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel.
023	ISA	017	007	In that day a man shall trust in him that made him, and his eyes shall have respect to the Holy One of Israel.
023	ISA	017	008	And they shall not at all trust in their altars, nor in the works of their hands, which their fingers made; and they shall not look to the trees, nor to their abominations.
023	ISA	017	009	In that day thy cities shall be deserted, as the Amorites and the Evaeans deserted [theirs], because of the children of Israel; and they shall be desolate.
023	ISA	017	010	Because thou hast forsaken God thy Saviour, and hast not been mindful of the Lord thy helper; therefore shalt thou plant a false plant, and a false seed.
023	ISA	017	011	In the day wherein thou shalt plant thou shalt be deceived; but if thou sow in the morning, [the seed] shall spring up for a crop in the day wherein thou shalt obtain an inheritance, and as a man's father, thou shalt obtain an inheritance for thy sons.
023	ISA	017	012	Woe [to] the multitude of many nations, as the swelling sea, so shall ye be confounded; and the force of many nations shall sound like water;
023	ISA	017	013	many nations like much water, as when much water rushes violently: and they shall drive him away, and pursue him afar, as the dust of chaff when men winnow before the wind, and as a storm whirling the dust of the wheel.
023	ISA	017	014	Toward evening, and there shall be grief; before the morning, and he shall not be. This is the portion of them that spoiled you, and the inheritance to them that robbed you of your inheritance.
023	ISA	018	001	Woe to you, ye wings of the land of ships, beyond the rivers of Ethiopia.
023	ISA	018	002	He sends messengers by the sea, and paper letters on the water: for swift messengers shall go to a lofty nation, and to a strange and harsh people. Who is beyond it? a nation not looked for, and trodden down.
023	ISA	018	003	Now all the rivers of the land shall be inhabited as an inhabited country; their land shall be as when a signal is raised from a mountain; it shall be audible as the sound of a trumpet.
023	ISA	018	004	For thus said the Lord to me, There shall be security in my city, as the light of noonday heat, and it shall be as a cloud of dew in the day of harvest.
023	ISA	018	005	Before the reaping time, when the flower has been completely formed, and the unripe grape has put forth its flower and blossomed, then shall he take away the little clusters with pruning-hooks, and shall take away the small branches, and cut them off;
023	ISA	018	006	And he shall leave [them] together to the birds of the sky, and to the wild beasts of the earth: and the fowls of the sky shall be gathered upon them, and all the beasts of the land shall come upon him.
023	ISA	018	007	In that time shall presents be brought to the Lord of hosts from a people afflicted and peeled, and from a people great from henceforth and for ever; a nation hoping and [yet] trodden down, which is in a part of a river of his land, to the place where is the name of the Lord of hosts, the mount Sion.
023	ISA	019	001	THE VISION OF EGYPT. Behold, the Lord sits on a swift cloud, and shall come to Egypt: and the idols of Egypt shall be moved at his presence, and their heart shall faint within them.
023	ISA	019	002	And the Egyptians shall be stirred up against the Egyptians: and a man shall fight against his brother, and a man against his neighbor, city against city, and law against law.
023	ISA	019	003	And the spirit of the Egyptians shall be troubled within them; and I will frustrate their counsel: and they shall enquire of their gods and their images, and them that speak out of the earth, and them that have in them a divining spirit.
023	ISA	019	004	And I will deliver Egypt into the hands of men, of cruel lords; and cruel kings shall rule over them: thus saith the Lord of hosts.
023	ISA	019	005	And the Egyptians shall drink the water that is by the sea, but the river shall fail, and be dried up.
023	ISA	019	006	And the streams shall fail, and the canals of the river; and every reservoir of water shall be dried up, in every marsh also of reed and papyrus.
023	ISA	019	007	And all the green herbage round about the river, and everything sown by the side of the river, shall be blasted with the wind and dried up.
023	ISA	019	008	And the fishermen shall groan, and all that cast a hook into the river shall groan; they also that cast nets, and the anglers shall mourn.
023	ISA	019	009	And shame shall come upon them that work fine flax, and them that make fine linen.
023	ISA	019	010	And they that work at them shall be in pain, and all that make beer shall be grieved, and be pained in their souls.
023	ISA	019	011	And the princes of Tanis shall be fools: [as for] the king's wise counsellors, their counsel shall be turned into folly: how will ye say to the king, we are sons of wise men, sons of ancient kings?
023	ISA	019	012	Where are now thy wise men? and let them declare to thee, and say, What has the Lord of hosts purposed upon Egypt?
023	ISA	019	013	The princes of Tanis have failed, and the princes of Memphis are lifted up [with pride], and they shall cause Egypt to wander by tribes.
023	ISA	019	014	For the Lord has prepared for them a spirit of error, and they have caused Egypt to err in all their works, as one staggers who is drunken and vomits also.
023	ISA	019	015	And there shall be no work to the Egyptians, which shall make head or tail, or beginning or end.
023	ISA	019	016	But in that day the Egyptians shall be as women, in fear and in trembling because of the hand of the Lord of hosts, which he shall bring upon them.
023	ISA	019	017	And the land of the Jews shall be for a terror to the Egyptians: whosoever shall name it to them, they shall fear, because of the counsel which the Lord of hosts has purposed concerning it.
023	ISA	019	018	In that day there shall be five cities in Egypt speaking the language of Chanaan, and swearing by the name of the Lord of hosts; one city shall be called the city of Asedec.
023	ISA	019	019	In that day there shall be an altar to the Lord in the land of the Egyptians, and a pillar to the Lord by its border.
023	ISA	019	020	And it shall be for a sign to the Lord for ever in the land of Egypt: for they shall presently cry to the Lord by reason of them that afflict them, and he shall send them a man who shall save them; he shall judge and save them.
023	ISA	019	021	And the Lord shall be known to the Egyptians, and the Egyptians shall know the Lord in that day; and they shall offer sacrifices, and shall vow vows to the Lord, and pay [them].
023	ISA	019	022	And the Lord shall smite the Egyptians with a stroke, and shall completely heal them: and they shall return to the Lord, and he shall hear them, and thoroughly heal them.
023	ISA	019	023	In that day there shall be a way from Egypt to the Assyrians, and the Assyrians shall enter into Egypt, and the Egyptians shall go to the Assyrians, and the Egyptians shall serve the Assyrians.
023	ISA	019	024	In that day shall Israel be third with the Egyptians and the Assyrians, blessed in the land which the Lord of hosts has blessed,
023	ISA	019	025	saying, Blessed be my people that is in Egypt, and that is among the Assyrians, and Israel mine inheritance.
023	ISA	020	001	In the year when Tanathan came to Azotus, when he was sent by Arna king of the Assyrians, and warred against Azotus, and took it;
023	ISA	020	002	then the Lord spoke to Esaias the son of Amos, saying, Go and take the sackcloth off thy loins, and loose thy sandals from off thy feet, and do thus, going naked and barefoot.
023	ISA	020	003	And the Lord said, As my servant Esaias has walked naked and barefoot three years, there shall be three years for signs and wonders to the Egyptians and Ethiopians;
023	ISA	020	004	for thus shall the king of the Assyrians lead the captivity of Egypt and the Ethiopians, young men and old, naked and barefoot, having the shame of Egypt exposed.
023	ISA	020	005	And the Egyptians being defeated shall be ashamed of the Ethiopians, in whom they had trusted; for they were their glory.
023	ISA	020	006	And they that dwell in this island shall say in that day, Behold, we trusted to flee to them for help, who could not save themselves from the king of the Assyrians: and how shall we be saved?
023	ISA	021	001	THE VISION OF THE DESERT. As though a whirlwind should pass through the desert, coming from a desert, [even] from such a land,
023	ISA	021	002	[so] a fearful and a grievous vision was declared to me: he that is treacherous deals treacherously, the transgressor transgresses. The Elamites are upon me, and the ambassadors of the Persians come against me: now will I groan and comfort myself.
023	ISA	021	003	Therefore are my loins filled with feebleness, and pangs have seized me as a travailing woman: I dealt wrongfully that I might not hear; I hasted that I might not see.
023	ISA	021	004	My heart wanders, and transgression overwhelms me; my soul is occupied with fear.
023	ISA	021	005	Prepare the table, eat, drink: arise, ye princes, and prepare [your] shields.
023	ISA	021	006	For thus said the Lord to me, Go and station a watchman for thyself, and declare whatever thou shalt see.
023	ISA	021	007	And I saw two mounted horsemen, and a rider on an ass, and a rider on a camel.
023	ISA	021	008	Hearken with great attention, and call thou Urias to the watch-tower: the Lord has spoken. I stood continually during the day, and I stood in the camp all night:
023	ISA	021	009	and, behold, he comes riding in a chariot and pair: and he answered and said, Babylon is fallen, is fallen; and all her images and her idols have been crushed to the ground.
023	ISA	021	010	Hear, ye that are left, and ye that are in pain, hear what things I have heard of the Lord of hosts [which] the God of Israel has declared to us. THE VISION OF IDUMEA.
023	ISA	021	011	Call to me out of Seir; guard ye the bulwarks.
023	ISA	021	012	I watch in the morning and the night: if thou wouldest enquire, enquire, and dwell by me.
023	ISA	021	013	Thou mayest lodge in the forest in the evening, or in the way of Daedan.
023	ISA	021	014	Ye that dwell in the country of Thaeman, bring water to meet him that is thirsty;
023	ISA	021	015	meet the fugitives with bread, because of the multitude of the slain, and because of the multitude of them that lose their way, and because of the multitude of swords, and because of the multitude of bent bows, and because of the multitude of them that have fallen in war.
023	ISA	021	016	For thus said the Lord to me, Yet a year, as the year of an hireling, [and] the glory of the sons of Kedar shall fail:
023	ISA	021	017	and the remnant of the strong bows of the sons of Kedar shall be small: for the Lord God of Israel has spoken [it].
023	ISA	022	001	THE WORD OF THE VALLEY OF SION. What has happened to thee, that now ye are all gone up to the housetops which help you not?
023	ISA	022	002	The city is filled with shouting [men]: thy slain are not slain with swords, nor are thy dead those who have died in battle.
023	ISA	022	003	All thy princes have fled, and [thy] captives are tightly bound, and the mighty [men] in thee have fled far away.
023	ISA	022	004	Therefore I said, Let me alone, I will weep bitterly; labour not to comfort me for the breach of the daughter of my people.
023	ISA	022	005	For [it is] a day of trouble, and of destruction, and of treading down, and [there is] perplexity [sent] from the Lord of hosts: they wander in the valley of Sion; they wander from the least to the greatest on the mountains.
023	ISA	022	006	And the Elamites took [their] quivers, and [there were] men mounted on horses, and [there was] a gathering for battle.
023	ISA	022	007	And it shall be [that] thy choice valleys shall be filled with chariots, and horsemen shall block up thy gates.
023	ISA	022	008	And they shall uncover the gates of Juda, and they shall look in that day on the choice houses of the city.
023	ISA	022	009	And they shall uncover the secret places of the houses of the citadel of David: and they saw that they were many, and that one [had] turned the water of the old pool into the city;
023	ISA	022	010	and that they [had] pulled down the houses of Jerusalem, to fortify the wall of the city.
023	ISA	022	011	And ye procured to yourselves water between the two walls within the ancient pool: but ye looked not to him that made it from the beginning, and regarded not him that created it.
023	ISA	022	012	And the Lord, the Lord of hosts, called in that day for weeping, and lamentation, and baldness, and for girding with sackcloth:
023	ISA	022	013	but they engaged in joy and gladness, slaying calves, and killing sheep, so as to eat flesh, and drink wine; saying, Let us eat and drink; for to-morrow we die.
023	ISA	022	014	And these things are revealed in the ears of the Lord of hosts: for this sin shall not be forgiven you, until ye die.
023	ISA	022	015	Thus saith the Lord of hosts, Go into the chamber, to Somnas the treasurer, and say to him, Why art thou here?
023	ISA	022	016	and what hast thou to do here, that thou hast here hewn thyself a sepulchre, and madest thyself a sepulchre on high, and hast graven for thyself a dwelling in the rock?
023	ISA	022	017	Behold now, the Lord of hosts casts forth and will utterly destroy [such] a man, and will take away thy robe and thy glorious crown,
023	ISA	022	018	and will cast thee into a great and unmeasured land, and there thou shalt die: and he will bring thy fair chariot to shame, and the house of thy prince to be trodden down.
023	ISA	022	019	And thou shalt be removed from thy stewardship, and from thy place.
023	ISA	022	020	And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will call my servant Eliakim the son of Chelcias:
023	ISA	022	021	and I will put on him thy robe, and I will grant him thy crown with power, and I will give thy stewardship into his hands: and he shall be as a father to them that dwell in Jerusalem, and to them that dwell in Juda.
023	ISA	022	022	And I will give him the glory of David; and he shall rule, and there shall be none to speak against him: and I will give him the key of the house of David [upon] his shoulder; and he shall open, and there shall be none to shut; and he shall shut, and there shall be none to open.
023	ISA	022	023	And I will make him a ruler in a sure place, and he shall be for a glorious throne of his father's house.
023	ISA	022	024	And every one that is glorious in the house of his father shall trust in him, from the least to the greatest; and they shall depend upon him in that day.
023	ISA	022	025	Thus saith the Lord of hosts, The man that is fastened in the sure place shall be removed and be taken away, and shall fall; and the glory that is upon him shall be utterly destroyed: for the Lord has spoken it.
023	ISA	023	001	THE WORD CONCERNING TYRE. Howl, ye ships of Carthage; for she has perished, and [men] no longer arrive from the land of the Citians: she is led captive.
023	ISA	023	002	To whom are the dwellers in the island become like, the merchants of Phoenice, passing over the sea
023	ISA	023	003	in great waters, a generation of merchants? as when the harvest is gathered in, [so are] these traders with the nations.
023	ISA	023	004	Be ashamed, O Sidon: the sea has said, yea, the strength of the sea has said, I have not travailed, nor brought forth, nor have I brought up young men, nor reared virgins.
023	ISA	023	005	Moreover when it shall be heard in Egypt, sorrow shall seize them for Tyre.
023	ISA	023	006	Depart ye to Carthage; howl, ye that dwell in this island.
023	ISA	023	007	Was not this your pride from the beginning, before she was given up?
023	ISA	023	008	Who has devised this counsel against Tyre? Is she inferior? or has she no strength? her merchants were the glorious princes of the earth.
023	ISA	023	009	The Lord of hosts has purposed to bring down all the pride of the glorious ones, and to disgrace every glorious thing on the earth.
023	ISA	023	010	Till thy land; for ships no more come out of Carthage.
023	ISA	023	011	And thy hand prevails no more by sea, which troubled kings: the Lord of hosts has given a command concerning Chanaan, to destroy the strength thereof.
023	ISA	023	012	And [men] shall say, Ye shall no longer at all continue to insult and injure the daughter of Sidon: and if thou depart to the Citians, neither there shalt thou have rest.
023	ISA	023	013	And [if thou depart] to the land of the Chaldeans, this also is laid waste by the Assyrians, for her wall is fallen.
023	ISA	023	014	Howl, ye ships of Carthage: for your strong hold is destroyed.
023	ISA	023	015	And it shall come to pass in that day, [that] Tyre shall be left seventy years, as the time of a king, as the time of a man: and it shall come to pass after seventy years, [that] Tyre shall be as the song of a harlot.
023	ISA	023	016	Take a harp, go about, O city, thou harlot that hast been forgotten; play well on the harp, sing many [songs], that thou mayest be remembered.
023	ISA	023	017	And it shall come to pass after the seventy years, [that] God will visit Tyre, and she shall be again restored to her primitive state, and she shall be a mart for all the kingdoms of the world on the face of the earth.
023	ISA	023	018	And her trade and her gain shall be holiness to the Lord: it shall not be gathered for them, but for those that dwell before the Lord, [even] all her trade, to eat and drink and be filled, and for a covenant [and] a memorial before the Lord.
023	ISA	024	001	Behold, the Lord is about to lay waste the world, and will make it desolate, and will lay bare the surface of it, and scatter them that dwell therein.
023	ISA	024	002	And the people shall be as the priest, and the servant as the lord, and the maid as the mistress; the buyer shall be as the seller, the lender as the borrower, and the debtor as his creditor.
023	ISA	024	003	The earth shall be completely laid waste, and the earth shall be utterly spoiled: for the mouth of the Lord has spoken these things.
023	ISA	024	004	The earth mourns, and the world is ruined, the lofty ones of the earth are mourning.
023	ISA	024	005	And she has sinned by reason of her inhabitants; because they have transgressed the law, and changed the ordinances, [even] the everlasting covenant.
023	ISA	024	006	Therefore a curse shall consume the earth, because the inhabitants thereof have sinned: therefore the dwellers in the earth shall be poor, and few men shall be left.
023	ISA	024	007	The wine shall mourn, the vine shall mourn, all the merry-hearted shall sigh.
023	ISA	024	008	The mirth of timbrels has ceased, the sound of the harp has ceased.
023	ISA	024	009	They are ashamed, they have not drunk wine; strong drink has become bitter to them that drink [it].
023	ISA	024	010	All the city has become desolate: one shall shut his house so that none shall enter.
023	ISA	024	011	There is a howling for the wine everywhere; all the mirth of the land has ceased, all the mirth of the land has departed.
023	ISA	024	012	And cities shall be left desolate, and houses being left shall fall to ruin.
023	ISA	024	013	All this shall be in the land in the midst of the nations, as if one should strip an olive tree, so shall they strip them; but when the vintage is done,
023	ISA	024	014	these shall cry aloud; and they that are left on the land shall rejoice together in the glory of the Lord: the water of the sea shall be troubled.
023	ISA	024	015	Therefore shall the glory of the Lord be in the isles of the sea; the name of the Lord shall be glorious.
023	ISA	024	016	O Lord God of Israel, from the ends of the earth we have heard wonderful things, [and there is] hope to the godly: but they shall say, Woe to the despisers, that despise the law.
023	ISA	024	017	Fear, and a pit, and a snare, are upon you that dwell on the earth.
023	ISA	024	018	And it shall come to pass, [that] he that flees from the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that comes up out of the pit shall be caught by the snare: for windows have been opened in heaven, and the foundations of the earth shall be shaken,
023	ISA	024	019	the earth shall be utterly confounded, and the earth shall be completely perplexed.
023	ISA	024	020	It reels as a drunkard and one oppressed with wine, and the earth shall be shaken as a storehouse of fruits; for iniquity has prevailed upon it, and it shall fall, and shall not be able to rise.
023	ISA	024	021	And God shall bring [his] hand upon the host of heaven, and upon the kings of the earth.
023	ISA	024	022	And they shall gather the multitude thereof into prisons, and they shall shut them into a strong hold: after many generations they shall be visited.
023	ISA	024	023	And the brick shall decay, and the wall shall fall; for the Lord shall reign from out of Sion, and out of Jerusalem, and shall be glorified before [his] elders.
023	ISA	025	001	O Lord God, I will glorify thee, I will sing to thy name; for thou hast done wonderful things, [even] an ancient [and] faithful counsel. So be it.
023	ISA	025	002	For thou hast made cities a heap, [even] cities [made] strong that their foundations should not fall: the city of ungodly men shall not be built for ever.
023	ISA	025	003	Therefore shall the poor people bless thee, and cities of injured men shall bless thee.
023	ISA	025	004	For thou hast been a helper to every lowly city, and a shelter to them that were disheartened by reason of poverty: thou shalt deliver them from wicked men: [thou hast been] a shelter of them that thirst, and a refreshing air to injured men.
023	ISA	025	005	[We were] as faint-hearted men thirsting in Sion, by reason of ungodly men to whom thou didst deliver us.
023	ISA	025	006	And the Lord of hosts shall make [a feast] for all the nations: on this mount they shall drink gladness, they shall drink wine:
023	ISA	025	007	they shall anoint themselves with ointment in this mountain. Impart thou all these things to the nations; for this is [God's] counsel upon all the nations.
023	ISA	025	008	Death has prevailed and swallowed [men] up; but again the Lord God has taken away every tear from every face. He has taken away the reproach of [his] people from all the earth: for the mouth of the Lord has spoken it.
023	ISA	025	009	And in that day they shall say, behold our God in whom we have trusted, and he shall save us: this [is] the Lord; we have waited for him, and we have exulted, and will rejoice in our salvation.
023	ISA	025	010	God will give rest on this mountain, and the country of Moab shall be trodden down, as they tread the floor with waggons.
023	ISA	025	011	And he shall spread forth his hands, even as he also brings down [man] to destroy [him]: and he shall bring low his pride [in regard to the thing] on which he has laid his hands.
023	ISA	025	012	And he shall bring down the height of the refuge of the wall, and it shall come down even to the ground.
023	ISA	026	001	In that day they shall sing this song in the land of Judea; Behold a strong city; and he shall make salvation [its] wall and bulwark.
023	ISA	026	002	Open ye the gates, let the nation enter that keeps righteousness, and keeps truth,
023	ISA	026	003	supporting truth, and keeping peace: for on thee, O Lord,
023	ISA	026	004	they have trusted with confidence for ever, the great, the eternal God;
023	ISA	026	005	who hast humbled and brought down them that dwell on high, thou shalt cast down strong cities, and bring them to the ground.
023	ISA	026	006	And the feet of the meek and lowly shall trample them.
023	ISA	026	007	The way of the godly is made straight: the way of the godly is also prepared.
023	ISA	026	008	For the way of the Lord is judgment: we have hoped in thy name, and on the remembrance [of thee],
023	ISA	026	009	which our soul longs for: my spirit seeks thee very early in the morning, O God, for thy commandments are a light on the earth: learn righteousness, ye that dwell upon the earth.
023	ISA	026	010	For the ungodly one is put down: no one who will not learn righteousness on the earth, shall be able to do the truth: let the ungodly be taken away, that he see not the glory of the Lord.
023	ISA	026	011	O Lord, thine arm is exalted, yet they knew it not: but when they know they shall be ashamed: jealousy shall seize upon an untaught nation, and now fire shall devour the adversaries.
023	ISA	026	012	O Lord our God, give us peace: for thou hast rendered to us all things.
023	ISA	026	013	O Lord our God, take possession of us: O Lord, we know not [any] other beside thee: we name thy name.
023	ISA	026	014	But the dead shall not see life, neither shall physicians by any means raise [them] up: therefore thou hast brought [wrath] upon [them], and slain [them], and hast taken away every male of them. Bring more evils upon them, O Lord;
023	ISA	026	015	bring more evils on the glorious ones of the earth.
023	ISA	026	016	Lord, in affliction I remembered thee; thy chastening was to us with small affliction.
023	ISA	026	017	And as a woman in travail draws nigh to be delivered, [and] cries out in her pain; so have we been to thy beloved.
023	ISA	026	018	We have conceived, O Lord, because of thy fear, and have been in pain, and have brought forth the breath of thy salvation, which we have wrought upon the earth: we shall not fall, but all that dwell upon the land shall fall.
023	ISA	026	019	The dead shall rise, and they that are in the tombs shall be raised, and they that are in the earth shall rejoice: for the dew from thee is healing to them: but the land of the ungodly shall perish.
023	ISA	026	020	Go, my people, enter into thy closets, shut thy door, hide thyself for a little season, until the anger of the Lord have passed away.
023	ISA	026	021	For, behold, the Lord is bringing wrath from [his] holy place upon the dwellers on the earth: the earth also shall disclose her blood, and shall not cover her slain.
023	ISA	027	001	In that day God shall bring [his] holy and great and strong sword upon the dragon, even the serpent that flees, upon the dragon, the crooked serpent: he shall destroy the dragon.
023	ISA	027	002	In that day [there shall be] a fair vineyard, [and] a desire to commence [a song] concerning it.
023	ISA	027	003	I am a strong city, a city in a siege: in vain shall I water it; for it shall be taken by night, and by day the wall shall fall.
023	ISA	027	004	There is no woman that has not taken hold of it; who will set me to watch stubble in the field? because of this enemy I have set her aside; therefore on this account the Lord has done all that he appointed.
023	ISA	027	005	I am burnt up; they that dwell in her shall cry, Let us make peace with him, let us make peace,
023	ISA	027	006	they that are coming are the children of Jacob. Israel shall bud and blossom, and the world shall be filled with his fruit.
023	ISA	027	007	Shall he himself be thus smitten, even as he smote? and as he slew, shall he be thus slain?
023	ISA	027	008	Fighting and reproaching he will dismiss them; didst thou not meditate with a harsh spirit, to slay them with a wrathful spirit?
023	ISA	027	009	Therefore shall the iniquity of Jacob be taken away; and this is his blessing, when I shall have taken away his sin; when they shall have broken to pieces all the stones of the altars as fine dust, and their trees shall not remain, and their idols shall be cut off, as a thicket afar off.
023	ISA	027	010	The flock that dwelt [there] shall be left, as a deserted flock; and [the ground] shall be for a long time for pasture, and there shall flocks lie down to rest.
023	ISA	027	011	And after a time there shall be in it no green thing because of [the grass] being parched. Come hither, ye women that come from a sight; for it is a people of no understanding; therefore he that made them shall have no pity upon them, and he that formed them shall have no mercy [upon them].
023	ISA	027	012	And it shall come to pass in that day [that] God shall fence [men] off from the channel of the river as far as Rhinocorura; but do ye gather one by one the children of Israel.
023	ISA	027	013	And it shall come to pass in that day [that] they shall blow the great trumpet, and the lost ones in the land of the Assyrians shall come, and the lost ones in Egypt, and shall worship the Lord on the holy mountain in Jerusalem.
023	ISA	028	001	Woe to the crown of pride, the hirelings of Ephraim, the flower that has fallen from the glory of the top of the fertile mountain, they that are drunken without wine.
023	ISA	028	002	Behold, the anger of the Lord is strong and severe, as descending hail where there is no shelter, violently descending; as a great body of water sweeping away the soil, he shall make rest for the land.
023	ISA	028	003	The crown of pride, the hirelings of Ephraim, shall be beaten down with the hands and with the feet.
023	ISA	028	004	And the fading flower of the glorious hope on the top of the high mountain shall be as the early fig; he that sees it, before he takes it into his hand, will desire to swallow it down.
023	ISA	028	005	In that day the Lord of hosts shall be the crown of hope, the woven [crown] of glory, to the remnant of the people.
023	ISA	028	006	They shall be left in the spirit of judgment for judgment, and for the strength of them that hinder slaying.
023	ISA	028	007	For these have trespassed through wine; they have erred through strong drink: the priest and the prophet are mad through strong drink, they are swallowed up by reason of wine, they have staggered through drunkenness; they have erred: this is [their] vision.
023	ISA	028	008	A curse shall devour this counsel, for this [is their] counsel for the sake of covetousness.
023	ISA	028	009	To whom have we reported evils? and to whom have we reported a message? [even to those] that are weaned from the milk, who are drawn from the breast.
023	ISA	028	010	Expect thou affliction on affliction, hope upon hope: yet a little, [and] yet a little,
023	ISA	028	011	by reason of the contemptuous [words] of the lips, by means of another language: for they shall speak to this people, saying to them,
023	ISA	028	012	This is the rest to him that is hungry, and this is the calamity: but they would not hear.
023	ISA	028	013	Therefore the oracle of God shall be to them affliction on affliction, hope on hope, yet a little, [and] yet a little, that they may go and fall backward; and they shall be crushed and shall be in danger, and shall be taken.
023	ISA	028	014	Therefore hear ye the word of the Lord, ye afflicted men, and ye princes of this people that is in Jerusalem.
023	ISA	028	015	Because ye have said, We have made a covenant with Hades, and agreements with death; if the rushing storm should pass, it shall not come upon us: we have made falsehood our hope, and by falsehood shall we be protected:
023	ISA	028	016	Therefore thus saith the Lord, [even] the Lord, Behold, I lay for the foundations of Sion a costly stone, a choice, a corner-stone, a precious [stone], for its foundations; and he that believes [on him] shall by no means be ashamed.
023	ISA	028	017	And I will cause judgment [to be] for hope, and my compassion shall be for [just] measures, and ye that trust vainly in falsehood [shall fall]: for the storm shall by no means pass by you,
023	ISA	028	018	except it also take away your covenant of death, and your trust in Hades shall by no means stand: if the rushing storm should come upon you, ye shall be beaten down by it.
023	ISA	028	019	Whenever it shall pass by, it shall take you; morning by morning it shall pass by in the day, and in the night there shall be an evil hope. Learn to hear,
023	ISA	028	020	ye that are distressed; we cannot fight, but we are ourselves too weak for you to be gathered.
023	ISA	028	021	The Lord shall rise up as a mountain of ungodly [men], and shall be in the valley of Gabaon; he shall perform his works with wrath, [even] a work of bitterness, and his wrath shall deal strangely, and his destruction shall be strange.
023	ISA	028	022	Therefore do not ye rejoice, neither let your bands be made strong; for I have heard of works finished and cut short by the Lord of hosts, which he will execute upon all the earth.
023	ISA	028	023	Hearken, and hear my voice; attend, and hear my words.
023	ISA	028	024	Will the ploughman plough all the day? or will he prepare the seed beforehand, before he tills the ground?
023	ISA	028	025	Does he not, when he has levelled the surface thereof, then sow the small black poppy, or cumin, and afterward sow wheat, and barley, and millet, and bread-corn in thy borders?
023	ISA	028	026	So thou shalt be chastened by the judgment of thy God, and shalt rejoice.
023	ISA	028	027	For the black poppy is not cleansed with harsh treatment, nor will a wagon-wheel pass over the cumin; but the black poppy is threshed with a rod, and the cumin shall be eaten with bread;
023	ISA	028	028	for I will not be wroth with you for ever, neither shall the voice of my anger crush you.
023	ISA	028	029	And these signs came forth from the Lord of hosts. Take counsel, exalt vain comfort.
023	ISA	029	001	Alas for the city of Ariel, which David besieged. Gather ye fruits year by year; eat ye, for ye shall eat with Moab.
023	ISA	029	002	For I will grievously afflict Ariel: and her strength and her wealth shall be mine.
023	ISA	029	003	And I will compass thee about like David, and will raise a mound about thee, and set up towers round thee.
023	ISA	029	004	And thy words shall be brought down to the earth, and thy words shall sink down to the earth, and thy voice shall be as they that speak out of the earth, and thy voice shall be lowered to the ground.
023	ISA	029	005	But the wealth of the ungodly shall be as dust from a wheel, and the multitude of them that oppress thee as flying chaff, and it shall be suddenly as a moment,
023	ISA	029	006	from the Lord of Hosts: for there shall be a visitation with thunder, and earthquake, and a loud noise, a rushing tempest, and devouring flame of fire.
023	ISA	029	007	And the wealth of all the nations together, as many as have fought against Ariel, and all they that war against Jerusalem, and all who are gathered against her, and they that distress her, shall be as one that dreams in sleep by night.
023	ISA	029	008	And as men drink and eat in sleep, and when they have arisen, the dream is vain: and as a thirsty man dreams as if he drank, and having arisen is still thirsty, and his soul has desired in vain: so shall be the wealth of all the nations, as many as have fought against the mount Sion.
023	ISA	029	009	Faint ye, and be amazed, and be overpowered, not with strong drink nor with wine.
023	ISA	029	010	For the Lord has made you to drink a spirit of deep sleep; and he shall close their eyes, and [the eyes] of their prophets and of their rulers, who see secret things.
023	ISA	029	011	And all these things shall be to you as the words of this sealed book, which if they shall give to a learned man, saying, Read this, he shall then say, I cannot read [it], for it is sealed.
023	ISA	029	012	And this book shall be given into the hands of a man that is unlearned, and [one] shall say to him, Read this; and he shall say, I am not learned.
023	ISA	029	013	And the Lord has said, This people draw nigh to me with their mouth, and they honour me with their lips, but their heart is far from me: but in vain do they worship me, teaching the commandments and doctrines of men.
023	ISA	029	014	Therefore behold I will proceed to remove this people, and I will remove them: and I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will hide the understanding of the prudent.
023	ISA	029	015	Woe to them that deepen their counsel, and not by the Lord. Woe to them that take secret counsel, and whose works are in darkness, and they say, Who has seen us? and who shall know us, or what we do?
023	ISA	029	016	Shall ye not be counted as clay of the potter? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Thou didst not form me? or the work to the maker, Thou hast not made me wisely?
023	ISA	029	017	[Is it] not yet a little while, and Libanus shall be changed as the mountains of Chermel, and Chermel shall be reckoned as a forest?
023	ISA	029	018	And in that day the deaf shall hear the words of the book, and they that are in darkness, and they that are in mist: the eyes of the blind shall see,
023	ISA	029	019	and the poor shall rejoice with joy because of the Lord, and they that had no hope among men shall be filled with joy.
023	ISA	029	020	The lawless man has come to nought, and the proud man has perished, and they that transgress mischievously have been utterly destroyed:
023	ISA	029	021	and they that cause men to sin by a word: and men shall make all that reprove in the gates an offence, because they have unjustly turned aside the righteous.
023	ISA	029	022	Therefore thus saith the Lord concerning the house of Jacob, whom he set apart from Abraam, Jacob shall not now be ashamed, neither shall he now change countenance.
023	ISA	029	023	But when their children shall have seen my works, they shall sanctify my name for my sake, and they sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and shall fear the God of Israel.
023	ISA	029	024	And they that erred in spirit shall know understanding, and the murmurers shall learn obedience, and the stammering tongues shall learn to speak peace.
023	ISA	030	001	Woe to the apostate children, saith the Lord: ye have framed counsel, not by me, and covenants not by my Spirit, to add sins to sins:
023	ISA	030	002	[even] they that proceed to go down into Egypt, but they have not enquired of me, that they might be helped by Pharao, and protected by the Egyptians.
023	ISA	030	003	For the protection of Pharaoh shall be to you a disgrace, and [there shall be] a reproach to them that trust in Egypt.
023	ISA	030	004	For there are princes in Tanes, evil messengers.
023	ISA	030	005	In vain shall they labour [in seeking] to a people, which shall not profit them for help, but [shall be] for a shame and reproach.
023	ISA	030	006	THE VISION OF THE QUADRUPEDS IN THE DESERT. In affliction and distress, [where are] the lion and lion's whelp, thence [come] also asps, and the young of flying asps, [there shall they be] who bore their wealth on asses and camels to a nation which shall not profit them.
023	ISA	030	007	The Egyptians shall help you utterly in vain: tell them, This your consolation is vain.
023	ISA	030	008	Now then sit down and write these words on a tablet, and in a book; for these things shall be for [many long] days, and even for ever.
023	ISA	030	009	For the people is disobedient, false children, who would not hear the law of God:
023	ISA	030	010	who say to the prophets, Report not to us; and to them that see visions, Speak [them] not to us, but speak and report to us another error;
023	ISA	030	011	and turn us aside from this way; remove from us this path, and remove from us the oracle of Israel.
023	ISA	030	012	Therefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel, Because ye have refused to obey these words, and have trusted in falsehood; and because thou hast murmured, and been confident in this respect:
023	ISA	030	013	therefore shall this sin be to you as a wall suddenly falling when a strong city has been taken, of which the fall is very near at hand.
023	ISA	030	014	And the fall thereof shall be as the breaking of an earthen vessel, [as] small fragments of a pitcher, so that thou shouldest not find among them a sherd, with which thou mightest take up fire, and with which thou shouldest draw a little water.
023	ISA	030	015	Thus saith the Lord, the Holy Lord of Israel; When thou shalt turn and mourn, then thou shalt be saved; and thou shalt know where thou wast, when thou didst trust in vanities: [then] your strength became vain, yet ye would not hearken:
023	ISA	030	016	but ye said, We will flee upon horses; therefore shall ye flee: and, We will be aided by swift riders; therefore shall they that pursue you be swift.
023	ISA	030	017	A thousand shall flee because of the voice of one, and many shall flee on account of the voice of five; until ye be left as a signal-post upon a mountain, and as one bearing an ensign upon a hill.
023	ISA	030	018	And the Lord will again wait, that he may pity you, and will therefore be exalted that he may have mercy upon you: because the Lord your God is a judge: blessed are they that stay themselves upon him.
023	ISA	030	019	For the holy people shall dwell in Sion: and [whereas] Jerusalem has wept bitterly, [saying], Pity me; he shall pity thee: when he perceived the voice of thy cry, he hearkened to thee.
023	ISA	030	020	And [though] the Lord shall give you the bread of affliction and scant water, yet they that cause thee to err shall no more at all draw nigh to thee; for thine eyes shall see those that cause thee to err,
023	ISA	030	021	and thine ears shall hear the words of them that went after thee to lead thee astray, who say, This [is] the way, let us walk in it, whether to the right or to the left.
023	ISA	030	022	And thou shalt pollute the plated idols, and thou shalt grind to powder the gilt ones, and shalt scatter them as the water of a removed [woman], and thou shalt thrust them forth as dung.
023	ISA	030	023	Then shall there be rain to the seed of thy land; and the bread of the fruit of thy land shall be plenteous and rich: and thy cattle shall feed in that day in a fertile and spacious place.
023	ISA	030	024	Your bulls and your oxen that till the ground, shall eat chaff mixed with winnowed barley.
023	ISA	030	025	And there shall be upon every lofty mountain and upon every high hill, water running in that day, when many shall perish, and when the towers shall fall.
023	ISA	030	026	And the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold in the day when the Lord shall heal the breach of his people, and shall heal the pain of thy wound.
023	ISA	030	027	Behold, the name of the Lord comes after a [long] time, burning wrath: the word of his lips is with glory, a word full of anger, and the anger of his wrath shall devour as fire.
023	ISA	030	028	And his breath, as rushing water in a valley, shall reach as far as the neck, and be divided, to confound the nations for [their] vain error: error also shall pursue them, and overtake them.
023	ISA	030	029	Must ye always rejoice, and go into my holy places continually, as they that keep a feast? and must ye go with a pipe, as those that rejoice, into the mountain of the Lord, to the God of Israel?
023	ISA	030	030	And the Lord shall make his glorious voice to be heard, and the wrath of his arm, to make a display with wrath and anger and devouring flame: he shall lighten terribly, and [his wrath shall be] as water and violent hail.
023	ISA	030	031	For by the voice of the Lord the Assyrians shall be overcome, [even] by the stroke wherewith he shall smite them.
023	ISA	030	032	And it shall happen to him from every side, [that] they from whom their hope of assistance was, in which he trusted, themselves shall war against him in turn with drums and with harp.
023	ISA	030	033	For thou shalt be required before [thy] time: has it been prepared for thee also to reign? nay, God has [prepared for thee] a deep trench, wood piled, fire and much wood: the wrath of the Lord [shall be] as a trench kindled with sulphur.
023	ISA	031	001	Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help, who trust in horses and chariots, for they are many; and in horses, [which are] a great multitude; and have not trusted in the Holy One of Israel, and have not sought the Lord.
023	ISA	031	002	Therefore he has wisely brought evils upon them, and his word shall not be frustrated; and he shall rise up against the houses of wicked men, and against their vain hope,
023	ISA	031	003	[even] an Egyptian, a man, and not God; the flesh of horses, and there is no help [in them]: but the Lord shall bring his hand upon them, and the helpers shall fail, and all shall perish together.
023	ISA	031	004	For thus said the Lord to me, As a lion would roar, or a lion's whelp over prey which he has taken, and cry over it, until the mountains are filled with his voice, and [the animals] are awe-struck and tremble at the fierceness of his wrath: so the Lord of hosts shall descend to fight upon the mount Sion, [even] upon her mountains.
023	ISA	031	005	As birds flying, so shall the Lord of hosts defend; he shall defend Jerusalem, and he shall rescue, and save and deliver.
023	ISA	031	006	Turn, ye children of Israel, who devise a deep and sinful counsel.
023	ISA	031	007	For in that day men shall renounce their silver idols and [their] golden idols, which their hands made.
023	ISA	031	008	And the Assyrian shall fall: not the sword of a great man, nor the sword of a mean man shall devour him; neither shall he flee from the face of the sword: but the young men shall be overthrown:
023	ISA	031	009	for they shall be compassed with rocks as with a trench, and shall be worsted; and he that flees shall be taken. Thus saith the Lord, Blesses is he that has a seed in Sion, and household friends in Jerusalem.
023	ISA	032	001	For, behold, a righteous king shall reign, and princes shall govern with judgment.
023	ISA	032	002	And a man shall hide his words, and be hidden, as from rushing water, and shall appear in Sion as a rushing river, glorious in a thirsty land.
023	ISA	032	003	And they shall no more trust in men, but they shall incline their ears to hear.
023	ISA	032	004	And the heart of the weak ones shall attend to hear, and the stammering tongues shall soon learn to speak peace.
023	ISA	032	005	And they shall no more at all tell a fool to rule, and thy servants shall no more at all say, Be silent.
023	ISA	032	006	For the fool shall speak foolish words, and his heart shall meditate vanities, and to perform lawless deeds and to speak error against the Lord, to scatter hungry souls, and he will cause the thirsty souls to be empty.
023	ISA	032	007	For the counsel of the wicked will devise iniquity, to destroy the poor with unjust words, and ruin the cause of the poor in judgment.
023	ISA	032	008	But the godly have devised wise [measures], and this counsel shall stand.
023	ISA	032	009	Rise up, ye rich women, and hear my voice; ye confident daughters, hearken to my words.
023	ISA	032	010	Remember for a full year in pain, yet with hope: the vintage has been cut off; it has ceased, it shall by no means come again.
023	ISA	032	011	Be amazed, be pained, ye confident ones: strip you, bare yourselves, gird your loins;
023	ISA	032	012	and beat your breasts, because of the pleasant field, and the fruit of the vine.
023	ISA	032	013	[As for] the land of my people, the thorn and grass shall come upon [it], and joy shall be removed from every house.
023	ISA	032	014	[As for] the rich city, the houses are deserted; they shall abandon the wealth of the city, [and] the pleasant houses: and the villages shall be caves for ever, the joy of wild asses, shepherds' pastures;
023	ISA	032	015	until the Spirit shall come upon you from on high, and Chermel shall be desert, and Chermel shall be counted for a forest.
023	ISA	032	016	Then judgment shall abide in the wilderness, and righteousness shall dwell in Carmel.
023	ISA	032	017	And the works of righteousness shall be peace; and righteousness shall ensure rest, and [the righteous] shall be confident for ever.
023	ISA	032	018	And his people shall inhabit a city of peace, and dwell in [it] in confidence, and they shall rest with wealth.
023	ISA	032	019	And if the hail should come down, it shall not come upon you; and they that dwell in the forests shall be in confidence, as those in the plain country.
023	ISA	032	020	Blessed are they that sow by every water, where the ox and ass tread.
023	ISA	033	001	Woe to them that afflict you; but no one makes you miserable: and he that deals perfidiously with you does not deal perfidiously: they that deal perfidiously shall be taken and given up, and as a moth on a garment, so shall they be spoiled.
023	ISA	033	002	Lord, have mercy upon us; for we have trusted in thee: the seed of the rebellious is gone to destruction, but our deliverance was in a time of affliction.
023	ISA	033	003	By reason of the terrible sound the nations were dismayed for fear of thee, and the heathen were scattered.
023	ISA	033	004	And now shall the spoils of your small and great be gathered: as if one should gather locusts, so shall they mock you.
023	ISA	033	005	The God who dwells on high is holy: Sion is filled with judgment and righteousness.
023	ISA	033	006	They shall be delivered up to the law: our salvation is our treasure: there are wisdom and knowledge and piety toward the Lord; these are the treasures of righteousness.
023	ISA	033	007	Behold now, these shall be terrified with fear of you: those whom ye feared shall cry out because of you: messengers shall be sent, bitterly weeping, entreating for peace.
023	ISA	033	008	For the ways of these shall be made desolate: the terror of the nations has been made to cease, and the covenant with these is taken away, and ye shall by no means deem them men.
023	ISA	033	009	The land mourns; Libanus is ashamed: Saron is become marshes; Galilee shall be laid bare, and Chermel.
023	ISA	033	010	Now will I arise, saith the Lord, now will I be glorified; now will I be exalted.
023	ISA	033	011	Now shall ye see, now shall ye perceive; the strength of your breath, shall be vain; fire shall devour you.
023	ISA	033	012	And the nations shall be burnt up; as a thorn in the field cast out and burnt up.
023	ISA	033	013	They that are afar off shall hear what I have done; they that draw nigh shall know my strength.
023	ISA	033	014	The sinners in Sion have departed; trembling shall seize the ungodly. Who will tell you that a fire is kindled? Who will tell you of the eternal place?
023	ISA	033	015	He that walks in righteousness, speaking rightly, hating transgression and iniquity, and shaking his hands from gifts, stopping his ears that he should not hear the judgment of blood, shutting his eyes that he should not see injustice.
023	ISA	033	016	he shall dwell in a high cave of a strong rock: bread shall be given him, and his water shall be sure.
023	ISA	033	017	Ye shall see a king with glory: your eyes shall behold a land from afar.
023	ISA	033	018	Your soul shall meditate terror. Where are the scribes? where are the counsellors, where is he that numbers them that are growing up,
023	ISA	033	019	[even] the small and great people? with whom he took not counsel, neither did he understand [a people] of deep speech, so that a despised people should not hear, and there is no understanding to him that hears.
023	ISA	033	020	Behold the city of Sion, our refuge: thine eyes shall behold Jerusalem, a rich city, tabernacles which shall not be shaken, neither shall the pins of her tabernacle be moved for ever, neither shall her cords be at all broken:
023	ISA	033	021	for the name of the Lord is great to you: ye shall have a place, [even] rivers and wide and spacious channels: thou shalt not go this way, neither a vessel with oars go [thereby].
023	ISA	033	022	For my God is great: the Lord our judge shall not pass me by: the Lord is our prince, the Lord is our king; the Lord, he shall save us.
023	ISA	033	023	Thy cords are broken, for they had no strength: thy meat has given way, it shall not spread the sails, it shall not bear a signal, until it be given up for plunder; therefore shall many lame men take spoil.
023	ISA	033	024	And the people dwelling among them shall by no means say, I am in pain: for their sin shall be forgiven them.
023	ISA	034	001	Draw near, ye nations; and hearken, ye princes; let the earth hear, and they that are in it; the world, and the people that are therein.
023	ISA	034	002	For the wrath of the Lord is upon all nations, and [his] anger upon the number of them, to destroy them, and give them up to slaughter.
023	ISA	034	003	And their slain shall be cast forth, and their corpses; and their [ill] savour shall come up, and the mountains shall be made wet with their blood.
023	ISA	034	004	And all the powers of the heavens shall melt, and the sky shall be rolled up like a scroll: and all the stars shall fall like leaves from a vine, and as leaves fall from a fig-tree.
023	ISA	034	005	My sword has been made drunk in heaven: behold, it shall come down upon Idumea, and with judgment upon the people doomed to destruction.
023	ISA	034	006	The sword of the Lord is filled with blood, it is glutted with fat, with the blood of goats and lambs, and with the fat of goats and rams: for the Lord has a sacrifice in Bosor, and a great slaughter in Idumea.
023	ISA	034	007	And the mighty ones shall fall with them, and the rams and the bulls; and the land shall be soaked with blood, and shall be filled with their fat.
023	ISA	034	008	For it is the day of judgment of the Lord, and the year of the recompence of Sion in judgment.
023	ISA	034	009	And her valleys shall be turned into pitch, and her land into sulphur; and her land shall be as pitch burning night and day;
023	ISA	034	010	and it shall never be quenched, and her smoke shall go up: it shall be made desolate throughout her generations,
023	ISA	034	011	and for a long time birds and hedgehogs, and ibises and ravens shall dwell in it: and the measuring line of desolation shall be cast over it, and satyrs shall dwell in it.
023	ISA	034	012	Her princes shall be no more; for her kings and her great men shall be destroyed.
023	ISA	034	013	And thorns shall spring up in their cities, and in her strong holds: and they shall be habitations of monsters, and a court of ostriches.
023	ISA	034	014	And devils shall meet with satyrs, and they shall cry one to the other: there shall satyrs rest, having found for themselves [a place of] rest.
023	ISA	034	015	There has the hedgehog made its nest, and the earth has safely preserved its young: there have the deer met, and seen one another's faces.
023	ISA	034	016	They passed by in [full] number, and not one of them perished: they sought not one another; for the Lord commanded them, and his Spirit gathered them.
023	ISA	034	017	And he shall cast lots for them, and his hand has portioned out [their] pasture, [saying], Ye shall inherit [the land] for ever: they shall rest on it [through] all generations.
023	ISA	035	001	Be glad, thou thirsty desert: let the wilderness exult, and flower as the lily.
023	ISA	035	002	And the desert places of Jordan shall blossom and rejoice; the glory of Libanus has been given to it, and the honour of Carmel; and my people shall see the glory of the Lord, and the majesty of God.
023	ISA	035	003	Be strong, ye relaxed hands and palsied knees.
023	ISA	035	004	Comfort one another, ye fainthearted; be strong, fear not; behold, our God renders judgment, and he will render [it]; he will come and save us.
023	ISA	035	005	Then shall the eyes of the blind be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall hear.
023	ISA	035	006	Then shall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the stammerers shall speak plainly; for water has burst forth in the desert, and a channel [of water] in a thirsty land.
023	ISA	035	007	And the dry land shall become pools, and a fountain of water shall [be poured] into the thirsty land; there shall there be a joy of birds, ready habitations and marshes.
023	ISA	035	008	There shall be there a pure way, and it shall be called a holy way; and there shall not pass by there any unclean person, neither shall there be there an unclean way; but the dispersed shall walk on it, and they shall not go astray.
023	ISA	035	009	And there shall be no lion there, neither shall any evil beast go up upon it, nor at all be found there; but the redeemed and gathered on the Lord's behalf, shall walk in it,
023	ISA	035	010	and shall return, and come to Sion with joy, and everlasting joy [shall be] over their head; for on their head [shall be] praise and exultation, and joy shall take possession of them: sorrow and pain, and groaning have fled away.
023	ISA	036	001	Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of the reign of Ezekias, [that] Sennacherim, king of the Assyrians, came up against the strong cities of Judea, and took them.
023	ISA	036	002	And the king of the Assyrians sent Rabsaces out of Laches to Jerusalem to king Ezekias with a large force: and he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the way of the fuller's field.
023	ISA	036	003	And there went forth to him Heliakim the steward, the [son] of Chelcias, and Somnas the scribe, and Joach the [son] of Asaph, the recorder.
023	ISA	036	004	And Rabsaces said to them, Say to Ezekias, Thus says the great king, the king of the Assyrians, Why art thou secure?
023	ISA	036	005	Is war carried on with counsel and [mere] words of the lips? and now on whom dost thou trust, that thou rebellest against me?
023	ISA	036	006	Behold, thou trustest on this bruised staff of reed, on Egypt: [as soon] as a man leans upon it, it shall go into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharao king of Egypt and all that trust in him.
023	ISA	036	007	But if ye say, We trust in the Lord our God;
023	ISA	036	008	yet now make an agreement with my lord the king of the Assyrians, and I will give you two thousand horses, if ye shall be able to set riders upon them.
023	ISA	036	009	And how can ye [then] turn to the face of the satraps? They that trust on the Egyptians for horse and rider, are [our] servants.
023	ISA	036	010	And now, Have we come up against this land to fight against it without the Lord? The Lord said to me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.
023	ISA	036	011	Then Eliakim and Somnas and Joach said to him, Speak to thy servants in the Syrian tongue; for we understand [it]: and speak not to us in the Jewish tongue: and wherefore speakest thou in the ears of the men on the wall?
023	ISA	036	012	And Rabsaces said to them, Has my lord sent me to your lord or to you, to speak these words? [has he] not [sent] me to the men that sit on the wall, that they may eat dung, and drink [their] water together with you?
023	ISA	036	013	And Rabsaces stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jewish language, and said, Hear ye the words of the great king, the king of the Assyrians:
023	ISA	036	014	thus says the king, Let not Ezekias deceive you with words: he will not be able to deliver you.
023	ISA	036	015	And let not Ezekias say to you, That God will deliver you, and this city will not at all be delivered into the hand of the king of the Assyrians.
023	ISA	036	016	Hearken not to Ezekias: thus says the king of the Assyrians, If ye wish to be blessed, come out to me: and ye shall eat every one [of] his vine and his fig-trees, and ye shall drink water out of your own cisterns:
023	ISA	036	017	until I come and take you to a land, like your own land, a land of corn and wine, and bread, and vineyards.
023	ISA	036	018	Let not Ezekias deceive you, saying, God will deliver you. Have the gods of the nations delivered each one his own land out of the hand of the king of the Assyrians?
023	ISA	036	019	Where is the god of Emath, and Arphath? and where is the god of Eppharuaim? have they been able to deliver Samaria out of my hand?
023	ISA	036	020	Which is the god of all these nations, that has delivered his land out of my hand, that God should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?
023	ISA	036	021	And they were silent, and none answered him a word; because the king had commanded that none should answer.
023	ISA	036	022	And Heliakim the [son] of Chelcias, the steward, and Somnas the military scribe, and Joach the [son] of Asaph, the recorder, came in to Ezekias, having their garments rent, and they reported to him the words of Rabsaces.
023	ISA	037	001	And it came to pass, when king Ezekias heard [it, that] he rent his clothes, and put on sackcloth, and went up to the house of the Lord.
023	ISA	037	002	And he sent Heliakim the steward, and Somnas the scribe, and the elders of the priests clothed with sackcloth, to Esaias the son of Amos, the prophet. And they said to him, Thus says Ezekias,
023	ISA	037	003	To-day is a day of affliction, and reproach, and rebuke, and anger: for the pangs are come upon the travailing [woman], but she has not strength to bring forth.
023	ISA	037	004	May the Lord thy God hear the words of Rabsaces, which the king of the Assyrians has sent, to reproach the living God, even to reproach with the words which the Lord thy God has heard: therefore thou shalt pray to thy Lord for these that are left.
023	ISA	037	005	So the servants of king Ezekias came to Esaias.
023	ISA	037	006	And Esaias said to them, Thus shall ye say to your master, Thus saith the Lord, Be not thou afraid at the words which thou hast heard, wherewith the ambassadors of the king of the Assyrians have reproached me,
023	ISA	037	007	Behold, I [will] send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a report, and return to his own country, and he shall fall by the sword in his own land.
023	ISA	037	008	So Rabsaces returned, and found the king of the Assyrians besieging Lobna: for he had heard that he had departed from Lachis.
023	ISA	037	009	And Tharaca king of the Ethiopians went forth to attack him. And when he heard it, he turned aside, and sent messengers to Ezekias, saying,
023	ISA	037	010	Thus shall ye say to Ezekias king of Judea, Let not thy God, in whom thou trustest, deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of the Assyrians.
023	ISA	037	011	Hast thou not heard what the kings of the Assyrians have done, how they have destroyed the whole earth? and shalt thou be delivered?
023	ISA	037	012	Have the gods of the nations which my fathers destroyed delivered them, both Gozan, and Charrhan, and Rapheth, which are in the land of Theemath?
023	ISA	037	013	Where are the kings of Emath? and where [is the king of] Arphath? and where [is the king] of the city of Eppharuaim, [and of] Anagugana?
023	ISA	037	014	And Ezekias received the letter from the messengers, and read it, and went up to the house of the Lord, and opened it before the Lord.
023	ISA	037	015	And Ezekias prayed to the Lord, saying,
023	ISA	037	016	O Lord of hosts, God of Israel, who sittest upon the cherubs, thou alone art the God of every kingdom of the world: thou hast made heaven and earth.
023	ISA	037	017	Incline thine ear, O Lord, hearken, O Lord; open thine eyes, O Lord, look, O Lord: and behold the words of Sennacherim, which he has sent to reproach the living God.
023	ISA	037	018	For of a truth, Lord, the kings of the Assyrians have laid waste the whole world, and the countries thereof,
023	ISA	037	019	and have cast their idols into the fire: for, they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone; and they have cast them away.
023	ISA	037	020	But now, O Lord our God, deliver us from his hands, that every kingdom of the earth may know that thou art God alone.
023	ISA	037	021	And Esaias the son of Amos was sent to Ezekias, and said to him, Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel, I have heard thy prayer to me concerning Sennacherim king of the Assyrians.
023	ISA	037	022	This is the word which God has spoken concerning him; The virgin daughter of Sion has despised thee, and mocked thee; the daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head at thee.
023	ISA	037	023	Whom hast thou reproached and provoked? and against whom hast thou lifted up thy voice? and hast thou not lifted up thine eyes on high against the Holy One of Israel?
023	ISA	037	024	For thou hast reproached the Lord by messengers; for thou hast said, With the multitude of chariots have I ascended to the height of mountains, and to the sides of Libanus; and I have cropped the height of his cedars and the beauty of his cypresses; and I entered into the height of the forest region:
023	ISA	037	025	and I have made a bridge, and dried up the waters, and every pool of water.
023	ISA	037	026	Hast thou not heard of these things which I did of old? I appointed [them] from ancient times; but now have I manifested [my purpose] of desolating nations in [their] strong holds, and them that dwell in strong cities.
023	ISA	037	027	I weakened [their] hands, and they withered; and they became as dry grass on the house-tops, and as grass.
023	ISA	037	028	But now I know thy rest, and thy going out, and thy coming in.
023	ISA	037	029	And thy wrath wherewith thou hast been enraged, and thy rancour has come up to me; therefore I will put a hook in thy nose, and a bit in thy lips, and will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.
023	ISA	037	030	And this shall be a sign to thee, Eat this year what thou hast sown; and the second year that which is left: and the third year sow, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.
023	ISA	037	031	And they that are left in Judea shall take root downward, and bear fruit upward:
023	ISA	037	032	for out of Jerusalem there shall be a remnant, and the saved ones out of mount Sion: the zeal of the Lord of hosts shall perform this.
023	ISA	037	033	Therefore thus saith the Lord concerning the king of the Assyrians, He shall not enter into this city, nor cast a weapon against it, nor bring a shield against it, nor make a rampart round it.
023	ISA	037	034	But by the way by which he came, by it shall he return, and shall not enter into this city: thus saith the Lord.
023	ISA	037	035	I will protect this city to save it for my own sake, and for my servant David's sake.
023	ISA	037	036	And the angel of the Lord went forth, and slew out of the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and eighty-five thousand: and they arose in the morning and found all [these] bodies dead.
023	ISA	037	037	And Sennacherim king of the Assyrians turned and departed, and dwelt in Nineve.
023	ISA	037	038	And while he was worshipping Nasarach his country's god in the house, Adramelech and Sarasar his sons smote him with swords; and they escaped into Armenia: and Asordan his son reigned in his stead.
023	ISA	038	001	And it came to pass at that time, [that] Ezekias was sick even to death. And Esaias the prophet the son of Amos came to him, and said to him, Thus saith the Lord, Give orders concerning thy house: for thou shalt die, and not live.
023	ISA	038	002	And Ezekias turned his face to the wall, and prayed to the Lord, saying,
023	ISA	038	003	Remember, O Lord, how I have walked before thee in truth, with a true heart, and have done that which was pleasing in thy sight. And Ezekias wept bitterly.
023	ISA	038	004	And the word of the Lord came to Esaias, saying, Go, and say to Ezekias,
023	ISA	038	005	Thus saith the Lord, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, and seen thy tears: behold, I [will] add to thy time fifteen years.
023	ISA	038	006	And I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of the Assyrians: and I will defend this city.
023	ISA	038	007	And this [shall be] a sign to thee from the Lord, that God will do this thing;
023	ISA	038	008	behold, I will turn back the shadow of the degrees [of the dial] by which ten degrees on the house of thy father the sun has gone down—I will turn back the sun the ten degrees; so the sun went back the ten degrees by which the shadow had gone down.
023	ISA	038	009	THE PRAYER OF EZEKIAS KING OF JUDEA, WHEN HE HAD BEEN SICK, AND WAS RECOVERED FROM HIS SICKNESS.
023	ISA	038	010	I said in the end of my days, I shall go to the gates of the grave: I shall part with the remainder of my years.
023	ISA	038	011	I said, I shall no more at all see the salvation of God in the land of the living: I shall no more at all see the salvation of Israel on the earth: I shall no more at all see man.
023	ISA	038	012	[My life] has failed from among my kindred: I have parted with the remainder of my life: it has gone forth and departed from me, as one that having pitched a tent takes it down [again]: my breath was with me as a weaver's web, when she that weaves draws nigh to cut off [the] thread.
023	ISA	038	013	In that day I was given up as to a lion until the morning: so has he broken all my bones: for I was so given up from day [even] to night.
023	ISA	038	014	As a swallow, so will I cry, and as a dove, so do I mourn: for mine eyes have failed with looking to the height of heaven to the Lord, who has delivered me, and removed the sorrow of my soul.
023	ISA	038	016	[Yea], O Lord, for it was told thee concerning this; and thou hast revived my breath; and I am comforted, and live.
023	ISA	038	017	For thou hast chosen my soul, that it should not perish: and thou hast cast all [my] sins behind me.
023	ISA	038	018	For they that are in the grave shall not praise thee, neither shall the dead bless thee, neither shall they that are in Hades hope for thy mercy.
023	ISA	038	019	The living shall bless thee, as I also [do]: for from this day shall I beget children, who shall declare thy righteousness,
023	ISA	038	020	O God of my salvation; and I will not cease blessing thee with the psaltery all the days of my life before the house of God.
023	ISA	038	021	Now Esaias had said to Ezekias; Take a cake of figs, and mash them, and apply them as a plaster, and thou shalt be well.
023	ISA	038	022	And Ezekias said, This is a sign to Ezekias, that I shall go up to the house of God.
023	ISA	039	001	At that time Marodach Baladan, the son of Baladan, the king of Babylonia, sent letters and ambassadors and gifts to Ezekias: for he had heard that he had been sick [even] to death, and was recovered.
023	ISA	039	002	And Ezekias was glad of their coming, and he shewed them the house of [his] spices, and of silver, and gold, and myrrh, and incense, and ointment, and all the houses of his treasures, and all that he had in his stores: and there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, which Ezekias did not shew.
023	ISA	039	003	And Esaias the prophet came to king Ezekias, and said to him, What say these men? and whence came they to thee? and Ezekias said, They are come to me from a land afar off, from Babylon.
023	ISA	039	004	And Esaias said, What have they seen in thine house? and Ezekias said, They have seen everything in my house; and there is nothing in my house which they have not seen: yea, also the [possessions] in my treasuries.
023	ISA	039	005	And Esaias said to him, Hear the word of the Lord of hosts:
023	ISA	039	006	Behold, the days come, when they shall take all the [things that are] in thine house, and all that thy fathers have gathered until this day, shall go to Babylon; and they shall not leave anything at all: and God hath said,
023	ISA	039	007	that they shall take also of thy children whom thou shalt beget; and they shall make them eunuchs in the house of the king of the Babylonians.
023	ISA	039	008	And Ezekias said to Esaias, Good is the word of the Lord, which he hath spoken: let there, I pray, be peace and righteousness in my days.
023	ISA	040	001	Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith God.
023	ISA	040	002	Speak, ye priests, to the heart of Jerusalem; comfort her, for her humiliation is accomplished, her sin is put away: for she has received of the Lord's hand double [the amount of] her sins.
023	ISA	040	003	The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight the paths of our God.
023	ISA	040	004	Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low: and all the crooked [ways] shall become straight, and the rough [places] plains.
023	ISA	040	005	And the glory of the Lord shall appear, and all flesh shall see the salvation of God: for the Lord has spoken [it].
023	ISA	040	006	The voice of one saying, Cry; and I said, What shall I cry? All flesh is grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass:
023	ISA	040	008	The grass withers, and the flower fades: but the word of our God abides for ever.
023	ISA	040	009	O thou that bringest glad tidings to Zion, go up on the high mountain; lift up thy voice with strength, thou that bringest glad tidings to Jerusalem; lift it up, fear not; say unto the cities of Juda, Behold your God!
023	ISA	040	010	Behold the Lord! The Lord is coming with strength, and [his] arm is with power: behold, his reward is with him, and [his] work before him.
023	ISA	040	011	He shall tend his flock as a shepherd, and he shall gather the lambs with his arm, and shall soothe them that are with young.
023	ISA	040	012	Who has measured the water in his hand, and the heaven with a span, and all the earth in a handful? Who has weighed the mountains in scales, and the forests in a balance?
023	ISA	040	013	Who has known the mind of the Lord? and who has been his counsellor, to instruct him?
023	ISA	040	014	Or with whom has he taken counsel, and he has instructed him? or who has taught him judgment, or who has taught him the way of understanding;
023	ISA	040	015	since all the nations are counted as a drop from a bucket, and as the turning of a balance, [and] shall be counted as spittle?
023	ISA	040	016	And Libanus is not enough to burn, nor all beasts enough for a whole-burnt offering:
023	ISA	040	017	and all the nations are as nothing, and counted as nothing.
023	ISA	040	018	To whom have ye compared the Lord? and with what likeness have ye compared him?
023	ISA	040	019	Has not the artificer made an image, or the goldsmith having melted gold, gilt it over, [and] made it a similitude?
023	ISA	040	020	For the artificer chooses out a wood that will not rot, and will wisely enquire how he shall set up his image, and [that so] that it should not be moved.
023	ISA	040	021	Will ye not know? will ye not hear? has it not been told you of old? Have ye not known the foundations of the earth?
023	ISA	040	022	[It is] he that comprehends the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants in it are as grasshoppers; he that set up the heaven as a chamber, and stretched [it] out as a tent to dwell in:
023	ISA	040	023	he that appoints princes to rule as nothing, and has made the earth as nothing.
023	ISA	040	024	For they shall not plant, neither shall they sow, neither shall their root be fixed in the ground: he has blown upon them, and they are withered, and a storm shall carry them away like sticks.
023	ISA	040	025	Now then to whom have ye compared me, that I may be exalted? saith the Holy One.
023	ISA	040	026	Lift up your eyes on high, and see, who has displayed all these things? [even] he that brings forth his host by number: he shall call them all by name by [means of his] great glory, and by the power of his might: nothing has escaped thee.
023	ISA	040	027	For say not thou, O Jacob, and why hast thou spoken, Israel, [saying], My way is hid from God, and my God has taken away [my] judgement, and has departed?
023	ISA	040	028	And now, hast thou not known? hast thou not heard? the eternal God, the God that formed the ends of the earth, shall not hunger, nor be weary, and there is no searching of his understanding.
023	ISA	040	029	He gives strength to the hungry, and sorrow to them that are not suffering.
023	ISA	040	030	For the young [men] shall hunger, and the youths shall be weary, and the choice [men] shall be powerless:
023	ISA	040	031	but they that wait on God shall renew [their] strength; they shall put forth new feathers like eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; they shall walk, and not hunger.
023	ISA	041	001	Hold a feast to me, ye islands: for the princes shall renew [their] strength: let them draw nigh and speak together: then let them declare judgment.
023	ISA	041	002	Who raised up righteousness from the east, [and] called it to his feet, so that it should go? shall appoint [it] an adversary of Gentiles, and shall dismay kings, and bury their swords in the earth, and cast forth their bows and arrows as sticks?
023	ISA	041	003	And he shall pursue them; the way of his feet shall proceed in peace.
023	ISA	041	004	Who has wrought and done these things? he has called it who called it from the generations of old; I God, the first and to [all] futurity, I AM.
023	ISA	041	005	The nations saw, and feared; the ends of the earth drew nigh, and came together,
023	ISA	041	006	every one judging for his neighbor and [that] to assist his brother: and one will say,
023	ISA	041	007	The artificer has become strong, and the coppersmith that smites with the hammer, [and] forges also: sometimes he will say, It is a piece well joined: they have fastened them with nails; they will fix them, and they shall not be moved.
023	ISA	041	008	But thou, Israel, art my servant Jacob, and he whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraam, whom I have loved:
023	ISA	041	009	whom I have taken hold of from the ends of the earth, and from the high places of it I have called thee, and said to thee, Thou art my servant; I have chosen thee, and I have not forsaken thee.
023	ISA	041	010	Fear not; for I am with thee: wander not; for I am thy God, who have strengthened thee; and I have helped thee, and have established thee with my just right hand.
023	ISA	041	011	Behold, all thine adversaries shall be ashamed and confounded; for they shall be as if they were not: and all thine opponents shall perish.
023	ISA	041	012	Thou shalt seek them, and thou shalt not find the men who shall insolently rage against thee: for they shall be as if they were not, and they that war against thee shall not be.
023	ISA	041	013	For I am thy God, who holdeth thy right hand, who saith to thee,
023	ISA	041	014	Fear not, Jacob, [and thou] Israel few in number; I have helped thee, saith thy God, he that redeems thee, O Israel.
023	ISA	041	015	Behold, I have made thee as new saw-shaped threshing wheels of a waggon; and thou shalt thresh the mountains, and beat the hills to powder, and make [them] as chaff:
023	ISA	041	016	and thou shalt winnow [them], and the wind shall carry them away, and a tempest shall scatter them: but thou shalt rejoice in the holy ones of Israel.
023	ISA	041	017	And the poor and the needy shall exult; for [when] they shall seek water, and there shall be none, [and] their tongue is parched with thirst, I the Lord God, I the God of Israel will hear, and will not forsake them:
023	ISA	041	018	but I will open rivers on the mountains, and fountains in the midst of plains: I will make the desert pools of water, and a thirsty land watercourses.
023	ISA	041	019	I will plant in the dry land the cedar and box, the myrtle and cypress, and white poplar:
023	ISA	041	020	that they may see, and know, and perceive, and understand together, that the hand of the Lord has wrought these [works], and the Holy One of Israel has displayed [them].
023	ISA	041	021	Your judgment draws nigh, saith the Lord God; your counsels have drawn nigh, saith the King of Jacob.
023	ISA	041	022	Let them draw nigh, and declare to you what things shall come to pass; or tell [us] what things were of old, and we will apply [our] understanding, and we shall know what are the last and the future things:
023	ISA	041	023	tell us, declare ye to us the things that are coming on at the last [time], and we shall know that ye are gods: do good, and do evil, and we shall wonder, and see at the same time
023	ISA	041	024	whence ye are, and whence is your works: they have chosen you an abomination out of the earth.
023	ISA	041	025	But I have raised up him that [comes] from the north, and him that [comes] from the rising of the sun: they shall be called by my name: let the princes come, and as potter's clay, and as a potter treading clay, so shall ye be trodden down.
023	ISA	041	026	For who will declare the things from the beginning, that we may know also the former things, and we will say that they are true? there is no one that speaks beforehand, nor anyone that hears your words.
023	ISA	041	027	I will give dominion to Sion, and will comfort Jerusalem by the way.
023	ISA	041	028	For from among the nations, behold, [there was] no one; and of their idols there was none to declare [anything]: and if I should ask them, Whence are ye? they could not answer me.
023	ISA	041	029	For [these] are your makers, [as ye think], and they that cause you to err in vain.
023	ISA	042	001	Jacob is my servant, I will help him: Israel is my chosen, my soul has accepted him; I have put my Spirit upon him; he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.
023	ISA	042	002	He shall not cry, nor lift up [his voice], nor shall his voice be heard without.
023	ISA	042	003	A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he not quench; but he shall bring forth judgment to truth.
023	ISA	042	004	He shall shine out, and shall not be discouraged, until he have set judgment on the earth: and in his name shall the Gentiles trust.
023	ISA	042	005	Thus saith the Lord God, who made the heaven, and established it; who settled the earth, and the things in it, and gives breath to the people on it, and spirit to them that tread on it:
023	ISA	042	006	I the Lord God have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine hand, and will strengthen thee: and I have given thee for the covenant of a race, for a light of the Gentiles:
023	ISA	042	007	to open the eyes of the blind, to bring the bound and them that sit in darkness out of bonds and the prison-house.
023	ISA	042	008	I am the Lord God: that is my name: I will not give my glory to another, nor my praises to graven images.
023	ISA	042	009	Behold, the ancient things have come to pass, and [so will] the new things which I tell you: yea, before I tell [them] they are made known to you.
023	ISA	042	010	Sing a new hymn to the Lord: ye [who are] his dominion, glorify his name from the end of the earth: ye that go down to the sea, and sail upon it; the islands, and they that dwell in them.
023	ISA	042	011	Rejoice, thou wilderness, and the villages thereof, the hamlets, and the dwellers in Kedar: the inhabitants of the rock shall rejoice, they shall shout from the top of the mountains.
023	ISA	042	012	They shall give glory to God, [and] shall proclaim his praises in the islands.
023	ISA	042	013	The Lord God of hosts shall go forth, and crush the war: he shall stir up jealousy, and shall shout mightily against his enemies.
023	ISA	042	014	I have been silent: shall I also always be silent and forbear: I have endured like a travailing [woman]: I will [now] amaze and wither at once.
023	ISA	042	015	I will make desolate mountains and hills, and will dry up all their grass; and I will make the rivers islands, and dry up the pools.
023	ISA	042	016	And I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not, and I will cause them to tread paths which they have not known: I will turn darkness into light for them, and crooked things into straight. These things will I do, and will not forsake them.
023	ISA	042	017	But they are turned back: be ye utterly ashamed that trust in graven [images], who say to the molten [images], Ye are our gods.
023	ISA	042	018	Hear, ye deaf, and look up, ye blind, to see.
023	ISA	042	019	And who is blind, but my servants? and deaf, but they that rule over them? yea, the servants of God have been made blind.
023	ISA	042	020	Ye have often seen, and have not taken heed; [your] ears have been opened, and ye have not heard.
023	ISA	042	021	The Lord God has taken counsel that he might be justified, and might magnify [his] praise.
023	ISA	042	022	And I beheld, and the people were spoiled and plundered: for [there is] a snare in the secret chambers everywhere, and in the houses also, where they have hidden them: they became a spoil, and there was no one that delivered the prey, and there was none who said, Restore.
023	ISA	042	023	Who [is there] among you that will give ear to these things? hearken ye to the things which are coming to pass.
023	ISA	042	024	For what did he give to Jacob up to spoil, and Israel to them that plundered him? Did not God [do it] against whom they sinned? [and] they would not walk in his ways, nor hearken to his law.
023	ISA	042	025	So he brought upon them the fury of his wrath; and the war, and those that burnt round about them, prevailed against them; yet no one of them knew [it], neither did they lay [it] to heart.
023	ISA	043	001	And now thus saith the Lord God that made thee, O Jacob, and formed thee, O Israel, Fear not: for I have redeemed thee, I have called thee [by] thy name; thou art mine.
023	ISA	043	002	And if thou pass through water, I am with thee; and the rivers shall not overflow thee: and if thou go through fire, thou shalt not be burned; the flame shall not burn thee.
023	ISA	043	003	For I am the Lord thy God, the Holy One of Israel, that saves thee: I have made Egypt and Ethiopia thy ransom, and [given] Soene for thee.
023	ISA	043	004	Since thou becamest precious in my sight, thou hast become glorious, and I have loved thee: and I will give men for thee, and princes for thy life.
023	ISA	043	005	Fear not; for I am with thee: I will bring thy seed from the east, and will gather thee from the west.
023	ISA	043	006	I will say to the north, Bring; and to the south, Keep not back; bring my sons from the [land] afar off, and my daughters from the ends of the earth;
023	ISA	043	007	[even] all who are called by my name: for I have prepared him for my glory, and I have formed him, and have made him:
023	ISA	043	008	and I have brought forth the blind people; for [their] eyes are alike blind, and they that have ears are deaf.
023	ISA	043	009	All the nations are gathered together, and princes shall be gathered out of them: who will declare these things? or who will declare to you things from the beginning? let them bring forth their witnesses, and be justified; and let them hear, and declare the truth.
023	ISA	043	010	Be ye my witnesses, and I [too am] a witness, saith the Lord God, and my servant whom I have chosen: that ye may know, and believe, and understand that I am [he]: before me there was no other God, and after me there shall be none.
023	ISA	043	011	I am God; and beside me there is no Saviour.
023	ISA	043	012	I have declared, and have saved; I have reproached, and there was no strange [god] among you: ye are my witnesses, and I am the Lord God,
023	ISA	043	013	even from the beginning; and there is none that can deliver out of my hands: I will work, and who shall turn it back?
023	ISA	043	014	Thus saith the Lord God that redeems you, the Holy One of Israel; for your sakes I will send to Babylon, and I will stir up all that flee, and the Chaldeans shall be bound in ships.
023	ISA	043	015	I am the Lord God, your Holy One, who have appointed for Israel your king.
023	ISA	043	016	Thus saith the Lord, who makes a way in the sea, and a path in the mighty water;
023	ISA	043	017	who brought forth chariots and horse, and a mighty multitude: but they have lain down, and shall not rise: they are extinct, as quenched flax.
023	ISA	043	018	Remember ye not the former things, and consider not the ancient things.
023	ISA	043	019	Behold, I [will] do new things, which shall presently spring forth, and ye shall know them: and I will make a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the dry land.
023	ISA	043	020	the beasts of the field shall bless me, the owls and young ostriches; for I have given water in the wilderness, and rivers in the dry land, to give drink to my chosen race,
023	ISA	043	021	my people whom I have preserved to tell forth my praises.
023	ISA	043	022	I have not now called thee, O Jacob; neither have I made thee weary, O Israel.
023	ISA	043	023	Thou hast not brought me the sheep of thy whole-burnt-offering; neither hast thou glorified me with thy sacrifices. I have not caused thee to serve with sacrifices, neither have I wearied thee with frankincense.
023	ISA	043	024	Neither hast thou purchased for me victims for silver, neither have I desired the fat of thy sacrifices: but thou didst stand before me in thy sins, and in thine iniquities.
023	ISA	043	025	I, [even] I, am he that blots out thy transgressions for mine own sake, and thy sins; and I will not remember [them].
023	ISA	043	026	But do thou remember, and let us plead [together]: do thou first confess thy transgressions, that thou mayest be justified.
023	ISA	043	027	Your fathers first, and your princes have transgressed against me.
023	ISA	043	028	And the princes have defiled my sanctuaries: so I gave Jacob [to enemies] to destroy, and Israel to reproach.
023	ISA	044	001	But now hear, Jacob my servant; and Israel, whom I have chosen.
023	ISA	044	002	Thus saith the Lord God that made thee, and he that formed thee from the womb; Thou shalt yet be helped: fear not, my servant Jacob; and beloved Israel, whom I have chosen.
023	ISA	044	003	For I will give water to the thirsty that walk in a dry land: I will put my Spirit upon thy seed, and my blessings upon thy children:
023	ISA	044	004	and they shall spring up as grass between brooks, and as willows on [the banks of] running water.
023	ISA	044	005	One shall say, I am God's; and another shall call himself by the name of Jacob; and another shall write with his hand, I am God's, and shall call himself by the name of Israel.
023	ISA	044	006	Thus saith God the King of Israel, and the God of hosts that delivered him; I am the first, and I am hereafter: beside me there is no God.
023	ISA	044	007	Who is like me? let him stand, and call, and declare, and prepare for me from the time that I made man for ever; and let them tell you the things that are coming before they arrive.
023	ISA	044	008	Hide not yourselves, nor go astray: have ye not heard from the beginning, and [have not] I told you? ye are witnesses if there is a God beside me.
023	ISA	044	009	But they that framed [false gods] did not then hearken; and they that graved [images] are all vain, performing their own desires, which shall not profit them, but they shall be ashamed
023	ISA	044	010	that form a god, and all that grave worthless things:
023	ISA	044	011	and all by whom they were made are withered: yea, let all the deaf be gathered from [among] men, and let them stand together; and let them be ashamed and confounded together:
023	ISA	044	012	For the artificer sharpens the iron; he fashions [the idol] with an axe, and fixes it with an awl, and fashions it with the strength of his arm: and he will be hungry and weak, and will drink no water.
023	ISA	044	013	The artificer having chosen a piece of wood, marks it out with a rule, and fits it with glue, and makes it as the form of a man, and as the beauty of a man, to set it up in the house.
023	ISA	044	014	He cuts wood out of the forest, which the Lord planted, [even] a pine tree, and the rain made it grow,
023	ISA	044	015	that it might be for men to burn: and having taken part of it he warms himself; yea, they burn part of it, and bake loaves thereon; and [of] the rest they make for themselves gods, and they worship them.
023	ISA	044	016	Half thereof he burns in the fire, and with half of it he bakes loaves on the coals; and having roasted flesh on it he eats, and is satisfied, and having warmed himself he says, I am comfortable, for I have warmed myself, and have seen the fire.
023	ISA	044	017	And the rest he makes a graven god, and worships, and prays, saying, Deliver me; for thou art my God.
023	ISA	044	018	They have no understanding to perceive; for they have been blinded so that they should not see with their eyes, nor perceive with their heart.
023	ISA	044	019	And one has not considered in his mind, nor known in his understanding, that he has burnt up half of it in the fire, and baked loaves on the coals thereof and has roasted and eaten flesh, and of the rest of it he has made an abomination, and they worship it.
023	ISA	044	020	Know thou that their heart is ashes, and they err, and no one is able to deliver his soul: see, ye will not say, [There is a] lie in my right hand.
023	ISA	044	021	Remember these things, O Jacob and Israel; for thou art my servant; I have formed thee [to be] my servant: and do thou, Israel, not forget me.
023	ISA	044	022	For behold, I have blotted out as a cloud thy transgressions, and thy sin as darkness: turn to me, and I will redeem thee.
023	ISA	044	023	Rejoice, ye heavens; for God has had mercy upon Israel: sound the trumpet, ye foundations of the earth: ye mountains, shout [with] joy, ye hills, and all the trees therein: for God has redeemed Jacob, and Israel shall be glorified.
023	ISA	044	024	Thus saith the Lord that redeems thee, and who formed thee from the womb, I am the Lord that performs all things: I stretched out the heaven alone, and established the earth.
023	ISA	044	025	Who else will frustrate the tokens of those that have divining spirits, and prophecies from the heart of [man]? turning the wise back, and making their counsel foolishness;
023	ISA	044	026	and confirming the word of his servant, and verifying the counsel of his messengers: who says to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be inhabited; and to the cities of Idumea, Ye shall be built, and her desert places shall spring forth.
023	ISA	044	027	Who says to the deep, Thou shalt be dried up, and I will dry up the rivers.
023	ISA	044	028	Who bids Cyrus be wise, and he shall perform all my will: who says to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be built, and I will lay the foundation of my holy house.
023	ISA	045	001	Thus saith the Lord God to my anointed Cyrus, whose right hand I have held, that nations might be obedient before him; and I will break through the strength of kings; I will open doors before him, and cities shall not be closed.
023	ISA	045	002	I will go before thee, and will level mountains: I will break to pieces brazen doors, and burst iron bars.
023	ISA	045	003	And I will give thee the treasures of darkness, I will open to thee hidden, unseen [treasures], that thou mayest know that I, the Lord thy God, that call thee by name, am the God of Israel.
023	ISA	045	004	For the sake of my servant Jacob, and Israel mine elect, I will call thee by thy name, and accept thee: but thou hast not known me.
023	ISA	045	005	For I am the Lord God, and there is no other God beside me; I strengthened thee, and thou hast not known me.
023	ISA	045	006	That they that [come] from the east and they that [come] from the west may know that there is no God but me. I am the Lord God, and there is none beside.
023	ISA	045	007	I am he that prepared light, and formed darkness; who make peace, and create evil; I am the Lord God, that does all these things.
023	ISA	045	008	Let the heaven rejoice from above, and let the clouds rain righteousness: let the earth bring forth, and blossom [with] mercy, and bring forth righteousness likewise: I am the Lord that created thee.
023	ISA	045	009	What excellent thing have I prepared as clay of the potter? Will the ploughman plough the earth all day? shall the clay say to the potter, What art thou doing that thou dost not work, nor hast hands? shall the thing formed answer him that formed it?
023	ISA	045	010	As though one should say to [his] father, What wilt thou beget me? and to his mother, What art thou bringing forth?
023	ISA	045	011	For thus saith the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel, who has formed the things that are to come, Enquire of me concerning my sons, and concerning the works of my hands command me.
023	ISA	045	012	I have made the earth, and man upon it: I with my hand have established the heaven; I have given commandment to all the stars.
023	ISA	045	013	I have raised him up [to be] a king with righteousness, and all his ways are right: he shall build my city, and shall turn the captivity of my people, not for ransoms, nor for rewards, saith the Lord of hosts.
023	ISA	045	014	Thus saith the Lord of hosts, Egypt has laboured [for thee]; and the merchandise of the Ethiopians, and the Sabeans, men of stature, shall pass over to thee, and shall be thy servants; and they shall follow after thee bound in fetters, and shall pass over to thee, and shall do obeisance to thee, and make supplication to thee: because God is in thee; and there is no God beside thee, [O Lord].
023	ISA	045	015	For thou art God, yet we knew [it] not, the God of Israel, the Saviour.
023	ISA	045	016	All that are opposed to him shall be ashamed and confounded, and shall walk in shame: ye isles, keep a feast to me.
023	ISA	045	017	Israel is saved by the Lord with an everlasting salvation: they shall not be ashamed nor confounded for evermore.
023	ISA	045	018	Thus saith the Lord that made the heaven, this God that created the earth, and made it; he marked it out, he made it not in vain, but formed it to be inhabited: I am the Lord, and there is none beside.
023	ISA	045	019	I have not spoken in secret, nor in a dark place of the earth: I said not to the seed of Jacob, Seek vanity: I, even I, am the Lord, speaking righteousness, and proclaiming truth.
023	ISA	045	020	Assemble yourselves and come; take counsel together, ye that escape of the nations: they that set up wood, [even] their graven image, have no knowledge, nor they who pray to gods that do not save.
023	ISA	045	021	If they will declare, let them draw nigh, that they may know together, who has caused these things to be heard from the beginning: then was it told you. I am God, and there is not another beside me; a just [God] and a Saviour; there is none but me.
023	ISA	045	022	Turn ye to me, and ye shall be saved, ye that [come] from the end of the earth: I am God, and there is none other.
023	ISA	045	023	By myself I swear, righteousness shall surely proceed out of my mouth; my words shall not be frustrated; that to me every knee shall bend, and every tongue shall swear by God,
023	ISA	045	024	saying, Righteousness and glory shall come to him: and all that remove them from their borders shall be ashamed.
023	ISA	045	025	By the Lord shall they be justified, and in God shall all the seed of the children of Israel be glorified.
023	ISA	046	001	Bel has fallen, Nabo is broken to pieces, their graven images are gone to the wild beasts and the cattle: ye take them packed up as a burden to the weary, exhausted, hungry, and [at the same time] helpless man;
023	ISA	046	002	who will not be able to save themselves from war, but they themselves are led [away] captive.
023	ISA	046	003	Hear me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of Israel, who are borne [by me] from the womb, and taught [by me] from infancy, [even] to old age:
023	ISA	046	004	I am [he]; and until ye shall have grown old, I am [he]: I bear you, I have made, and I will relieve, I will take up and save you.
023	ISA	046	005	To whom have ye compared me? see, consider, ye that go astray.
023	ISA	046	006	They that furnish gold out of a purse, and silver by weight, will weigh it in a scale, and they hire a goldsmith and make idols, and bow down, and worship them.
023	ISA	046	007	They bear it upon the shoulder, and go; and if they put it upon its place, it remains, it cannot move: and whosoever shall cry to it, it cannot hear; it cannot save him from trouble.
023	ISA	046	008	Remember ye these things, and groan: repent, ye that have gone astray, return in your heart;
023	ISA	046	009	and remember the former things [that were] of old: for I am God, and there is none other beside me,
023	ISA	046	010	telling beforehand the latter events before they come to pass, and they are accomplished together: and I said, all my counsel shall stand, and I will do all things that I have planned:
023	ISA	046	011	calling a bird from the east, and from a land afar off, for the things which I have planned: I have spoken, and brought [him]; I have created and made [him]; I have brought him, and prospered his way.
023	ISA	046	012	Hearken to me, ye senseless ones, that are far from righteousness:
023	ISA	046	013	I have brought near my righteousness, and I will not be slow with the salvation that is from me: I have given salvation in Sion to Israel for glory.
023	ISA	047	001	Come down, sit on the ground, O virgin daughter of Babylon: sit on the ground, O daughter of the Chaldeans: for thou shalt no more be called tender and luxurious.
023	ISA	047	002	Take a millstone, grind meal: remove thy veil, uncover thy white hairs, make bare the leg, pass through the rivers.
023	ISA	047	003	Thy shame shall be uncovered, thy reproaches shall be brought to light: I will exact of thee due vengeance, I will no longer deliver thee to men.
023	ISA	047	004	Thy deliverer is the Lord of hosts, the Holy One of Israel is his name.
023	ISA	047	005	Sit thou down pierced with woe, go into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans: thou shalt no more be called the strength of a kingdom.
023	ISA	047	006	I have been provoked with my people; thou hast defiled mine inheritance: I gave them into thy hand, but thou didst not extend mercy to them: thou madest the yoke of the aged man very heavy,
023	ISA	047	007	and saidst, I shall be a princess for ever: thou didst not perceive these things in thine heart, nor didst thou remember the latter end.
023	ISA	047	008	But now hear these words, thou luxurious one, [who art] the one that sits [at ease], that is secure, that says in her heart, I am, and there is not another; I shall not sit a widow, neither shall I know bereavement.
023	ISA	047	009	But now these two things shall come upon thee suddenly in one day, the loss of children and widowhood shall come suddenly upon thee, for thy sorcery, for the strength of thine enchantments,
023	ISA	047	010	for thy trusting in wickedness: for thou saidst, I am, and there is not another: know thou, the understanding of these things and thy harlotry shall be thy shame; for thou saidst in thy heart, I am, and there is not another.
023	ISA	047	011	And destruction shall come upon thee, and thou shalt not be aware; [there shall be a] pit, and thou shalt fall into it: and grief shall come upon thee, and thou shalt not be able to be clear; and destruction shall come suddenly upon thee, and thou shalt not know.
023	ISA	047	012	Stand now with thine enchantments, and with the abundance of thy sorcery, which thou hast learned from thy youth; if thou canst be profited.
023	ISA	047	013	Thou art wearied in thy counsels. Let now the astrologers of the heaven stand and deliver thee, let them that see the stars tell thee what is about to come upon thee.
023	ISA	047	014	Behold, they all shall be burnt up as sticks in the fire; neither shall they at all deliver their life from the flame. Because thou hast coals of fire, sit thou upon them;
023	ISA	047	015	these shall be thy help. Thou hast wearied thyself with traffic from thy youth: every man has wandered to his own home, but thou shalt have no deliverance.
023	ISA	048	001	Hear these [words], ye house of Jacob, who are called by the name of Israel, and have come forth out of Juda, who swear by the name of the Lord God of Israel, making mention [of it, but] not with truth, nor with righteousness;
023	ISA	048	002	maintaining also the name of the holy city, and staying themselves on the God of Israel: the Lord of hosts is his name. The former things I have already declared;
023	ISA	048	003	and they that have proceeded out of my mouth, and it became well known; I wrought suddenly, and [the events] came to pass.
023	ISA	048	004	I know that thou art stubborn, and thy neck is an iron sinew, and thy forehead brazen.
023	ISA	048	005	And I told thee of old what [should be] before it came upon thee; I made it known to thee, lest thou shouldest say, [My] idols have done [it] for me; and shouldest say, [My] graven and molten images have commanded me.
023	ISA	048	006	Ye have heard all this, but ye have not known: yet I have made known to thee the new things from henceforth, which are coming to pass, and thou saidst not,
023	ISA	048	007	Now they come to pass, and not formerly: and thou heardest not of them in former days: say not thou, Yea, I know them.
023	ISA	048	008	Thou hast neither known, nor understood, neither from the beginning have I opened thine ears: for I knew that thou wouldest surely deal treacherously, and wouldest be called a transgressor even from the womb.
023	ISA	048	009	For mine own sake will I shew thee my wrath, and will bring before thee my glorious acts, that I may not utterly destroy thee.
023	ISA	048	010	Behold, I have sold thee, [but] not for silver; but I have rescued thee from the furnace of affliction.
023	ISA	048	011	For mine own sake I will do [this] for thee, because my name is profaned; and I will not give my glory to another.
023	ISA	048	012	Hear me, O Jacob, and Israel whom I call; I am the first, and I endure for ever.
023	ISA	048	013	My hand also has founded the earth, and my right hand has fixed the sky: I will call them, and they shall stand together.
023	ISA	048	014	And all shall be gathered, and shall hear: who has told them these things? Out of love to thee I have fulfilled thy desire on Babylon, to abolish the seed of the Chaldeans.
023	ISA	048	015	I have spoken, I have called, I have brought him, and made his way prosperous.
023	ISA	048	016	Draw nigh to me, and hear ye these words; I have not spoken in secret from the beginning: when it took place, there was I, and now the Lord, [even] the Lord, and his Spirit, hath sent me.
023	ISA	048	017	Thus saith the Lord that delivered thee, the Holy One of Israel; I am thy God, I have shewn thee how thou shouldest find the way wherein thou shouldest walk.
023	ISA	048	018	And if thou hadst hearkened to my commandments, [then] would thy peace have been like a river, and thy righteousness as a wave of the sea.
023	ISA	048	019	Thy seed also would have been as the sand, and the offspring of thy belly as the dust of the ground: neither now shalt thou by any means be utterly destroyed, neither shall thy name perish before me.
023	ISA	048	020	Go forth of Babylon, thou that fleest from the Chaldeans: utter aloud a voice of joy, and let this be made known, proclaim it to the end of the earth; say ye, The Lord hath delivered his servant Jacob.
023	ISA	048	021	And if they shall thirst, he shall lead them through the desert; he shall bring forth water to them out of the rock: the rock shall be cloven, and the water shall flow forth, and my people shall drink.
023	ISA	048	022	There is no joy, saith the Lord, to the ungodly.
023	ISA	049	001	Hearken to me, ye islands; and attend, ye Gentiles; after a long time it shall come to pass, saith the Lord: from my mother's womb he has called my name:
023	ISA	049	002	and he has made my mouth as a sharp sword, and he has hid me under the shadow of his hand; he has made me as a choice shaft, and he has hid me in his quiver;
023	ISA	049	003	and said to me, Thou art my servant, O Israel, and in thee I will be glorified.
023	ISA	049	004	Then I said, I have laboured in vain, I have given my strength for vanity and for nothing: therefore is my judgment with the Lord, and my labour before my God.
023	ISA	049	005	And now, thus saith the Lord that formed me from the womb to be his own servant, to gather Jacob to him and Israel. I shall be gathered and glorified before the Lord, and my God shall be my strength.
023	ISA	049	006	And he said to me, [It is] a great thing for thee to be called my servant, to establish the tribes of Jacob, and to recover the dispersion of Israel: behold, I have given thee for the covenant of a race, for a light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for salvation to the end of the earth.
023	ISA	049	007	Thus saith the Lord that delivered thee, the God of Israel, Sanctify him that despises his life, him that is abhorred by the nations that are the servants of princes: kings shall behold him, and princes shall arise, and shall worship him, for the Lord's sake: for the Holy One of Israel is faithful, and I have chosen thee.
023	ISA	049	008	Thus saith the Lord, In an acceptable time have I heard thee, and in a day of salvation have I succored thee: and I have formed thee, and given thee for a covenant of the nations, to establish the earth, and to cause to inherit the desert heritages:
023	ISA	049	009	saying to them that are in bonds, Go forth; and [bidding] them that are in darkness shew themselves. They shall be fed in all the ways, and in all the paths [shall be] their pasture.
023	ISA	049	010	They shall not hunger, neither shall they thirst; neither shall the heat nor the sun smite them; but he that has mercy on them shall comfort [them], and by fountains of waters shall he lead them.
023	ISA	049	011	And I will make every mountain a way, and every path a pasture to them.
023	ISA	049	012	Behold, these shall come from far: [and] these from the north and the west, and others from the land of the Persians.
023	ISA	049	013	Rejoice, ye heavens; and let the earth be glad: let the mountains break forth [with] joy; for the Lard has had mercy on his people, and has comforted the lowly ones of his people.
023	ISA	049	014	But Sion said, The Lord has forsaken me, and, The Lord has forgotten me.
023	ISA	049	015	Will a woman forget her child, so as not to have compassion upon the offspring of her womb? but if a woman should even forget these, yet I will not forget thee, saith the Lord.
023	ISA	049	016	Behold, I have painted thy walls on my hands, and thou art continually before me.
023	ISA	049	017	And thou shalt soon be built by those by whom thou were destroyed, and they that made thee desolate shall go forth of thee.
023	ISA	049	018	Lift up thine eyes round about, and look on them all; behold, they are gathered together, and are come to thee. [As] I live, saith the Lord, thou shalt clothe thyself with them all as with an ornament, and put them on as a bride her attire.
023	ISA	049	019	For thy desert and marred and ruined [places] shall now be too narrow by reason of the inhabitants, and they that devoured thee shall be removed far from thee.
023	ISA	049	020	For thy sons whom thou hast lost shall say in thine ears, The place [is too] narrow for me: make room for me that I may dwell.
023	ISA	049	021	And thou shalt say in thine heart, Who has begotten me these? whereas I [was] childless, and a widow; but who has brought up these for me? and I was left alone; but whence came these to me?
023	ISA	049	022	Thus saith the Lord, [even] the Lord, Behold, I lift up mine hand to the nations, and I will lift up my signal to the islands: and they shall bring thy sons in [their] bosom, and shall bear thy daughters on [their] shoulders.
023	ISA	049	023	And kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and their princesses thy nurses, they shall bow down to thee on the face of the earth, and shall lick the dust of thy feet; and thou shalt know that I am the Lord, and they that wait on me shall not be ashamed.
023	ISA	049	024	Will any one take spoils from a giant? and if one should take [a man] captive unjustly, shall he be delivered?
023	ISA	049	025	For thus saith the Lord, If one should take a giant captive, he shall take spoils, and he who takes [them] from a mighty [man] shall be delivered: for I will plead thy cause, and I will deliver thy children.
023	ISA	049	026	And they that afflicted thee shall eat their own flesh; and they shall drink their own blood as new wine, and shall be drunken: and all flesh shall perceive that I am the Lord that delivers thee, and that upholds the strength of Jacob.
023	ISA	050	001	Thus saith the Lord, Of what kind is your mother's bill of divorcement, by which I put her away? or to which debtor have I sold you? Behold, ye are sold for your sins, and for your iniquities have I put your mother away.
023	ISA	050	002	Why did I come, and there was no man? [why] did I call, and there was none to hearken? Is not my hand strong to redeem? or can I not deliver? behold, by my rebuke I will dry up the sea, and make rivers a wilderness; and their fish shall be dried up because there is no water, and shall die for thirst.
023	ISA	050	003	I will clothe the sky with darkness, and will make its covering as sackcloth.
023	ISA	050	004	The Lord [even] God gives me the tongue of instruction, to know when it is fit to speak a word: he has appointed for me early, he has given me an ear to hear:
023	ISA	050	005	and the instruction of the Lord, even the Lord, opens mine ears, and I do not disobey, nor dispute.
023	ISA	050	006	I gave my back to scourges, and my cheeks to blows; and I turned not away my face from the shame of spitting:
023	ISA	050	007	but the Lord God became my helper; therefore I was not ashamed, but I set my face as a solid rock; and I know that I shall never be ashamed,
023	ISA	050	008	for he that has justified me draws near; who is he that pleads with me? let him stand up against me at the same time: yea, who is he that pleads with me? let him draw nigh to me.
023	ISA	050	009	Behold, the Lord, the Lord, will help me; who will hurt me? behold, all ye shall wax old as a garment, and a moth shall devour you.
023	ISA	050	010	Who is among you that fears the Lord? let him hearken to the voice of his servant: ye that walk in darkness, and have no light, trust in the name of the Lord, and stay upon God.
023	ISA	050	011	Behold, ye all kindle a fire, and feed a flame: walk in the light of your fire, and in the flame which ye have kindled. This has happened to you for my sake; ye shall lie down in sorrow.
023	ISA	051	001	Hearken to me, ye that follow after righteousness, and seek the Lord: look to the solid rock, which ye have hewn, and to the hole of the pit which ye have dug.
023	ISA	051	002	Look to Abraam your father, and to Sarrha that bore you: for he was alone when I called him, and blessed him, and loved him, and multiplied him.
023	ISA	051	003	And now I will comfort thee, O Sion: and I have comforted all her desert places; and I will make her desert places as a garden, and her western places as the garden of the Lord; they shall find in her gladness and exultation, thanksgiving and the voice of praise.
023	ISA	051	004	Hear me, hear me, my people; and ye kings, hearken to me: for a law shall proceed from me, and my judgment [shall be] for a light of the nations.
023	ISA	051	005	My righteousness speedily draws nigh, and my salvation shall go forth as light, and on mine arm shall the Gentiles trust: the isles shall wait for me, and on mine arm shall they trust.
023	ISA	051	006	Lift up your eyes to the sky, and look on the earth beneath: for the sky was darkened like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a garment, and the inhabitants shall die in like manner: but my righteousness shall not fail.
023	ISA	051	007	Hear me, ye that know judgment, the people in whose heart is my law: fear not the reproach of men, and be not overcome by their contempt.
023	ISA	051	008	For as a garment will be devoured by time, and as wool will be devoured by a moth, [so shall they be consumed]; but my righteousness shall be for ever, and my salvation for all generations.
023	ISA	051	009	Awake, awake, O Jerusalem, and put on the strength of thine arm; awake as in the early time, as the ancient generation.
023	ISA	051	010	Art thou not it that dried the sea, the water, [even] the abundance of the deep; that made the depths of the sea a way of passage for the delivered and redeemed?
023	ISA	051	011	for by [the help of] the Lord they shall return, and come to Sion with joy and everlasting exultation, for praise and joy shall come upon their head: pain, and grief, and groaning, have fled away.
023	ISA	051	012	I, [even] I, am he that comforts thee: consider who thou art, that thou wast afraid of mortal man, and of the son of man, who are withered as grass.
023	ISA	051	013	And thou hast forgotten God who made thee, who made the sky and founded the earth; and thou wert continually afraid because of the wrath of him that afflicted thee: for [whereas] he counselled to take thee away, yet now where is the wrath of him that afflicted thee?
023	ISA	051	014	For in thy deliverance he shall not halt, nor tarry;
023	ISA	051	015	for I am thy God, that troubles the sea, and causes the waves thereof to roar: the Lord of hosts is my name.
023	ISA	051	016	I will put my words into thy mouth, and I will shelter thee under the shadow of mine hand, with which I fixed the sky, and founded the earth: and [the Lord] shall say to Sion, Thou art my people.
023	ISA	051	017	Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, that hast drunk at the hand of the Lord the cup of his fury: for thou hast drunk out and drained the cup of calamity, the cup of wrath:
023	ISA	051	018	and there was none to comfort thee of all the children whom thou borest; and there was none to take hold of thine hand, not even of all the children whom thou has reared.
023	ISA	051	019	Wherefore these things are against thee; who shall sympathize with thee in thy grief? downfall, and destruction, famine, and sword: who shall comfort thee?
023	ISA	051	020	Thy sons are the perplexed ones, that sleep at the top of every street as a half-boiled beet; they that are full of the anger of the Lord, caused to faint by the Lord God.
023	ISA	051	021	Therefore hear, thou afflicted one, and drunken, [but] not with wine;
023	ISA	051	022	thus saith the Lord God that judges his people, Behold, I have taken out of thine hand the cup of calamity, the cup of my wrath; and thou shalt not drink it any more.
023	ISA	051	023	And I will give it into the hands of them that injured thee, and them that afflicted thee; who said to thy soul, Bow down, that we may pass over: and thou didst level thy body with the ground to them passing by without.
023	ISA	052	001	Awake, awake, Sion; put on thy strength, O Sion; and o thou put on thy glory, Jerusalem the holy city: there shall no more pass through thee, the uncircumcised and unclean.
023	ISA	052	002	Shake off the dust and arise; sit down, Jerusalem: put off the band of thy neck, captive daughter of Sion.
023	ISA	052	003	For thus saith the Lord, Ye have been sold for nought; and ye shall not be ransomed with silver.
023	ISA	052	004	Thus saith the Lord, My people went down before to Egypt to sojourn there; and were carried away forcibly to the Assyrians.
023	ISA	052	005	And now why are ye here? Thus saith the Lord, Because my people was taken for nothing, wonder ye and howl. Thus saith the Lord, On account of you my name is continually blasphemed among the Gentiles.
023	ISA	052	006	Therefore shall my people know my name in that day, for I am he that speaks: I am present,
023	ISA	052	007	as a season of beauty upon the mountains, as the feet of one preaching glad tidings of peace, as one preaching good news: for I will publish thy salvation, saying, O Sion, thy God shall reign.
023	ISA	052	008	For the voice of them that guard thee is exalted, and with the voice together they shall rejoice: for eyes shall look to eyes, when the Lord shall have mercy upon Sion.
023	ISA	052	009	Let the waste places of Jerusalem break forth [in] joy together, because the Lord has had mercy upon her, and has delivered Jerusalem.
023	ISA	052	010	And the Lord shall reveal his holy arm in the sight of all the nations; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation that [comes] from our God.
023	ISA	052	011	Depart ye, depart, go out from thence, and touch not the unclean thing; go ye out from the midst of her; separate yourselves, ye that bear the vessels of the Lord.
023	ISA	052	012	For ye shall not go forth with tumult, neither go by flight: for the Lord shall go first in advance of you; and the God of Israel shall be he that brings up your rear.
023	ISA	052	013	Behold, my servant shall understand, and be exalted, and glorified exceedingly.
023	ISA	052	014	As many shall be amazed at thee, so shall thy face be without glory from men, and thy glory [shall not be honoured] by the sons of men.
023	ISA	052	015	Thus shall many nations wonder at him; and kings shall keep their mouths shut: for they to whom no report was brought concerning him, shall see; and they who have not heard, shall consider.
023	ISA	053	001	O Lord, who has believed our report? and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?
023	ISA	053	002	We brought a report as [of] a child before him; [he is] as a root in a thirsty land: he has no form nor comeliness; and we saw him, but he had no form nor beauty.
023	ISA	053	003	But his form was ignoble, and inferior to that of the children of men; [he was] a man in suffering, and acquainted with the bearing of sickness, for his face is turned from [us]: he was dishonoured, and not esteemed.
023	ISA	053	004	He bears our sins, and is pained for us: yet we accounted him to be in trouble, and in suffering, and in affliction.
023	ISA	053	005	But he was wounded on account of our sins, and was bruised because of our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; [and] by his bruises we were healed.
023	ISA	053	006	All we as sheep have gone astray; every one has gone astray in his way; and the Lord gave him up for our sins.
023	ISA	053	007	And he, because of his affliction, opens not his mouth: he was led as a sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb before the shearer is dumb, so he opens not his mouth.
023	ISA	053	008	In [his] humiliation his judgment was taken away: who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken away from the earth: because of the iniquities of my people he was led to death.
023	ISA	053	009	And I will give the wicked for his burial, and the rich for his death; for he practised no iniquity, nor craft with his mouth.
023	ISA	053	010	The Lord also is pleased to purge him from his stroke. If ye can give an offering for sin, your soul shall see a long-lived seed:
023	ISA	053	011	the Lord also is pleased to take away from the travail of his soul, to shew him light, and to form [him] with understanding; to justify the just one who serves many well; and he shall bear their sins.
023	ISA	053	012	Therefore he shall inherit many, and he shall divide the spoils of the mighty; because his soul was delivered to death: and he was numbered among the transgressors; and he bore the sins of many, and was delivered because of their iniquities.
023	ISA	054	001	Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that dost not travail: for more are the children of the desolate than of her that has a husband: for the Lord has said,
023	ISA	054	002	Enlarge the place of thy tent, and of thy curtains: fix [the pins], spare not, lengthen thy cords, and strengthen thy pins;
023	ISA	054	003	spread forth [thy tent] yet to the right and the left: for thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles, and thou shalt make the desolate cities to be inhabited.
023	ISA	054	004	Fear not, because thou has been put to shame, neither be confounded, because thou was reproached: for thou shalt forget thy former shame, and shalt no more at all remember the reproach of thy widowhood.
023	ISA	054	005	For [it is] the Lord that made thee; the Lord of hosts is his name: and he that delivered thee, he is the God of Israel, [and] shall be called [so] by the whole earth.
023	ISA	054	006	The Lord has not called thee as a deserted and faint-hearted woman, nor as a woman hated from [her] youth, saith thy God.
023	ISA	054	007	For a little while I left thee: but with great mercy will I have compassion upon thee.
023	ISA	054	008	In a little wrath I turned away my face from thee; but with everlasting mercy will I have compassion upon thee, saith the Lord that delivers thee.
023	ISA	054	009	From the time of the water of Noe this is my [purpose]: as I sware to him at that time, [saying] of the earth, I will no more be wroth with thee, neither when thou art threatened,
023	ISA	054	010	shall the mountains depart, nor shall thy hills be removed: so neither shall my mercy fail thee, nor shall the covenant of thy peace be at all removed: for the Lord [who is] gracious to thee has spoken [it].
023	ISA	054	011	Afflicted and outcast thou has not been comforted: behold, I [will] prepare carbuncle [for] thy stones, and sapphire for thy foundations;
023	ISA	054	012	and I will make thy buttresses jasper, and thy gates crystal, and thy border precious stones.
023	ISA	054	013	And [I will cause] all thy sons [to be] taught of God, and thy children [to be] in great peace.
023	ISA	054	014	And thou shalt be built in righteousness: abstain from injustice, and thou shalt not fear; and trembling shall not come nigh thee.
023	ISA	054	015	Behold, strangers shall come to thee by me, and shall sojourn with thee, and shall run to thee for refuge.
023	ISA	054	016	Behold, I have created thee, not as the coppersmith blowing coals, and bringing out a vessel [fit] for work; but I have created thee, not for ruin, that [I] should destroy [thee].
023	ISA	054	017	I will not suffer any weapon formed against thee to prosper; and every voice that shall rise up against thee for judgment, thou shalt vanquish them all; and thine adversaries shall be [condemned] thereby. There is an inheritance to them that serve the Lord, and ye shall be righteous before me, saith the Lord.
023	ISA	055	001	Ye that thirst, go to the water, and all that have no money, go [and] buy; and eat [and drink] wine and fat without money or price.
023	ISA	055	002	Wherefore do ye value at the price of money, and [give] your labour for that which will not satisfy? hearken to me, and ye shall eat that which is good, and your soul shall feast itself on good things.
023	ISA	055	003	Give heed with your ears, and follow my ways: hearken to me, and your soul shall live in prosperity; and I will make with you an everlasting covenant, the sure mercies of David.
023	ISA	055	004	Behold I have made him a testimony among the Gentiles, a prince and commander to the Gentiles.
023	ISA	055	005	Nations which know thee not, shall call upon thee, and peoples which are not acquainted with thee, shall flee to thee for refuge, for the sake of the Lord thy God, the Holy One of Israel; for he has glorified thee.
023	ISA	055	006	Seek ye the Lord, and when ye find him, call upon him; and when he shall draw nigh to you,
023	ISA	055	007	let the ungodly leave his ways, and the transgressor his counsels: and let him return to the Lord, and he shall find mercy; for he shall abundantly pardon your sins.
023	ISA	055	008	For my counsels are not as your counsels, nor are my ways as your ways, saith the Lord.
023	ISA	055	009	But as the heaven is distant from the earth, so is my way distant from your ways, and your thoughts from my mind.
023	ISA	055	010	For as rain shall come down, or snow, from heaven, and shall not return until it have saturated the earth, and it bring forth, and bud, and give seed to the sower, and bread for food:
023	ISA	055	011	so shall my word be, whatever shall proceed out of my mouth, it shall by no means turn back, until all the things which I willed shall have been accomplished; and I will make thy ways prosperous, and [will effect] my commands.
023	ISA	055	012	For ye shall go forth with joy, and shall be taught with gladness: for the mountains and the hills shall exult to welcome you with joy, and all the trees of the field shall applaud with their branches.
023	ISA	055	013	And instead of the bramble shall come up the cypress, and instead of the nettle shall come up the myrtle: and the Lord shall be for a name, and for an everlasting sign, and shall not fail.
023	ISA	056	001	Thus saith the Lord, Keep ye judgment, and do justice: for my salvation is near to come, and my mercy to be revealed.
023	ISA	056	002	Blessed is the man that does these things, and the man that holds by them, and keeps the sabbaths from profaning them, and keeps his hands from doing unrighteousness.
023	ISA	056	003	Let not the stranger who attaches himself to the Lord, say, Surely the Lord will separate me from his people: and let not the eunuch say, I am a dry tree.
023	ISA	056	004	Thus saith the Lord to the eunuchs, as many as shall keep my sabbaths, and choose the things which I take pleasure in, and take hold of my covenant;
023	ISA	056	005	I will give to them in my house and within my walls an honourable place, better than sons and daughters: I will give them an everlasting name, and it shall not fail.
023	ISA	056	006	And [I will give it] to the strangers that attach themselves to the Lord, to serve him, and to love the name of the Lord, to be to him servants and handmaids; and [as for] all that keep my sabbaths from profaning [them], and that take hold of my covenant;
023	ISA	056	007	I will bring them to my holy mountain, and gladden them in my house of prayer: their whole-burnt-offerings and their sacrifices shall be acceptable upon mine altar; for my house shall be called a house of prayer for all nations,
023	ISA	056	008	saith the Lord that gathers the dispersed of Israel; for I will gather to him a congregation.
023	ISA	056	009	All ye beasts of the field, come, devour, all ye beasts of the forest.
023	ISA	056	010	See how they are all blinded: they have not known; [they are] dumb dogs [that] will not bark; dreaming of rest, loving to slumber.
023	ISA	056	011	Yea, they are insatiable dogs, that know not what it is to be filled, and they are wicked, having no understanding: all have followed their own ways, each according to his [will].
023	ISA	057	001	See how the just man has perished, and no one lays [it] to heart: and righteous men are taken away, and no one considers: for the righteous has been removed out of the way of injustice.
023	ISA	057	002	His burial shall be in peace: he has been removed out of the way.
023	ISA	057	003	But draw ye near hither, ye lawless children, the seed of adulterers and the harlot.
023	ISA	057	004	Wherein have ye been rioting? and against whom have ye opened your mouth, and against whom have ye loosed your tongue? are ye not children of perdition? a lawless seed?
023	ISA	057	005	who call upon idols under the leafy trees, slaying your children in the valleys among the rocks?
023	ISA	057	006	That is thy portion, this is thy lot: and to them hast thou poured forth drink-offerings, and to these hast thou offered meat-offerings. Shall I not therefore be angry for these things?
023	ISA	057	007	On a lofty and high mountain, there is thy bed, and thither thou carriedst up thy meat-offerings:
023	ISA	057	008	and behind the posts of thy door thou didst place thy memorials. Didst thou think that if thou shouldest depart from me, thou wouldest gain? thou hast loved those that lay with thee;
023	ISA	057	009	and thou hast multiplied thy whoredom with them, and thou hast increased the number of them that are far from thee, and hast sent ambassadors beyond thy borders, and hast been debased even to hell.
023	ISA	057	010	Thou has wearied thyself with thy many ways; yet thou saidst not, I will cease to strengthen myself: for thou has done these things; therefore thou has not supplicated me.
023	ISA	057	011	Through dread of whom hast thou feared, and lied against me, and has not remembered, nor considered me, nor regarded me, yea, though when I see thee I pass thee by, yet thou has not feared me.
023	ISA	057	012	And I will declare thy righteousness, and thy sins, which shall not profit thee.
023	ISA	057	013	When thou criest out, let them deliver thee in thine affliction: for all these the wind shall take, and the tempest shall carry [them] away: but they that cleave to me shall possess the land, and shall inherit my holy mountain.
023	ISA	057	014	And they shall say, Clear the ways before him, and take up the stumbling-blocks out of the way of my people.
023	ISA	057	015	Thus saith the Most High, who dwells on high for ever, Holy in the holies, is his name, the Most High resting in the holies, and giving patience to the faint-hearted, and giving life to the broken-hearted:
023	ISA	057	016	I will not take vengeance on you for ever, neither will I be always angry with you: for my Spirit shall go forth from me, and I have created all breath.
023	ISA	057	017	On account of sin for a little while I grieved him, and smote him, and turned away my face from him; and he was grieved, and he went on sorrowful in his ways.
023	ISA	057	018	I have seen his ways, and healed him, and comforted him, and given him true comfort;
023	ISA	057	019	peace upon peace to them that are far off, and to them that are nigh: and the Lord has said, I will heal them.
023	ISA	057	020	But the unrighteous shall be tossed as troubled waves, and shall not be able to rest.
023	ISA	057	021	There is no joy to the ungodly, said God.
023	ISA	058	001	Cry aloud, and spare not; lift up thy voice as with a trumpet, and declare to my people their sins, and to the house of Jacob their iniquities.
023	ISA	058	002	They seek me day by day, and desire to know my ways, as a people that had done righteousness, and had not forsaken the judgment of their God: they now ask of me righteous judgment, and desire to draw nigh to God,
023	ISA	058	003	saying, Why have we fasted, and thou regardest not? [why] have we afflicted our souls, and thou didst not know it? Nay, in the days of your fasts ye find your pleasures, and all them that are under your power ye wound.
023	ISA	058	004	If ye fast for quarrels and strifes, and smite the lowly with [your] fists, wherefore do ye fast to me as [ye do] this day, so that your voice may be heard in crying?
023	ISA	058	005	I have not chosen this fast, nor [such] a day for a man to afflict his soul; neither though thou shouldest bend down thy neck as a ring, and spread under thee sackcloth and ashes, neither thus shall ye call a fast acceptable.
023	ISA	058	006	I have not chosen such a fast, saith the Lord; but do thou loose every burden of iniquity, do thou untie the knots of hard bargains, set the bruised free, and cancel every unjust account.
023	ISA	058	007	Break thy bread to the hungry, and lead the unsheltered poor to thy house: if thou seest one naked, clothe [him], and thou shalt not disregard the relations of thine own seed.
023	ISA	058	008	Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thy health shall speedily spring forth: and thy righteousness shall go before thee, and the glory of God shall compass thee.
023	ISA	058	009	Then shalt thou cry, and God shall hearken to thee; while thou art yet speaking he will say, Behold, I am here. If thou remove from thee the band, and the stretching forth of the hands, and murmuring speech;
023	ISA	058	010	and [if] thou give bread to the hungry from thy heart, and satisfy the afflicted soul; then shall thy light spring up in darkness, and thy darkness [shall be] as noon-day:
023	ISA	058	011	and thy God shall be with thee continually, and thou shalt be satisfied according as thy soul desires; and thy bones shall be made fat, and shall be as a well-watered garden, and as a fountain [from] which the water has not failed.
023	ISA	058	012	And thy old waste desert [places] shall be built up, and thy foundations shall last through all generations; and thou shalt be called a repairer of breaches, and thou shalt cause thy paths between to be in peace.
023	ISA	058	013	If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, so as not to do thy pleasure on the holy days, and shalt call the sabbaths delightful, holy to God; [if] thou shalt not lift up thy foot to work, nor speak a word in anger out of thy mouth,
023	ISA	058	014	then shalt thou trust on the Lord; and he shall bring thee up to the good places of the land, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the Lord has spoken this.
023	ISA	059	001	Has the hand of the Lord no power to save? or has he made his ear heavy, so that he should not hear?
023	ISA	059	002	Nay, your iniquities separate between you and God, and because of your sins has he turned away [his] face from you, so as not to have mercy [upon you].
023	ISA	059	003	For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with sins; your lips also have spoken iniquity, and your tongue meditates unrighteousness.
023	ISA	059	004	None speaks justly, neither is there true judgment: they trust in vanities, and speak empty [words]; for they conceive trouble, and bring forth iniquity.
023	ISA	059	005	They have hatched asps' eggs, and weave a spider's web: and he that is going to eat of their eggs, having crushed an addled egg, has found also in it a basilisk.
023	ISA	059	006	Their web shall not become a garment, nor shall they at all clothe themselves with their works; for their works are works of iniquity.
023	ISA	059	007	And their feet run to wickedness, swift to shed blood; their thoughts also are thoughts of murder; destruction and misery are in their ways;
023	ISA	059	008	and the way of peace they know not, neither is there judgment in their ways; for their paths by which they go are crooked, and they know not peace.
023	ISA	059	009	Therefore has judgment departed from them, and righteousness shall not overtake them: while they waited for light, darkness came upon them; while they waited for brightness, they walked in perplexity.
023	ISA	059	010	They shall feel for the wall as blind [men], and shall feel [for it] as if they had no eyes: and they shall feel at noon-day as at midnight; they shall groan as dying men.
023	ISA	059	011	They shall proceed together as a bear and as a dove: we have waited for judgment, and there is no salvation, it is gone far from us.
023	ISA	059	012	For our iniquity is great before thee, and our sins have risen up against us: for our iniquities are in us, and we know our unrighteous deeds.
023	ISA	059	013	We have sinned, and dealt falsely, and revolted from our God: we have spoken unrighteous words, and have been disobedient; we have conceived and uttered from our heart unrighteous words.
023	ISA	059	014	And we have turned judgment back, and righteousness has departed afar off: for truth is consumed in their ways, and they could not pass by a straight [path].
023	ISA	059	015	And truth has been taken away, and they have turned aside [their] mind from understanding. And the Lord saw it, and it pleased him not that there was no judgment.
023	ISA	059	016	And he looked, and there was no man, and he observed, and there was none to help: so he defended them with his arm, and stablished [them] with [his] mercy.
023	ISA	059	017	And he put on righteousness as a breast-plate, and placed the helmet of salvation on his head; and he clothed himself with the garment of vengeance, and with his cloak,
023	ISA	059	018	as one about to render a recompence, [even] reproach to his adversaries.
023	ISA	059	019	So shall they of the west fear the name of the Lord, and they [that come] from the rising of the sun his glorious name: for the wrath of the Lord shall come as a mighty river, it shall come with fury.
023	ISA	059	020	And the deliverer shall come for Sion's sake, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob.
023	ISA	059	021	And this shall be my covenant with them, said the Lord; My Spirit which is upon thee, and the words which I have put in thy mouth, shall never fail from thy mouth, nor from the mouth of thy seed, for the Lord has spoken it, henceforth and for ever.
023	ISA	060	001	Be enlightened, be enlightened, O Jerusalem, for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee.
023	ISA	060	002	Behold, darkness shall cover the earth, and [there shall be] gross darkness on the nations: but the Lord shall appear upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee.
023	ISA	060	003	And kings shall walk in thy light, and nations in thy brightness.
023	ISA	060	004	Lift up thine eyes round about, and behold thy children gathered: all thy sons have come from far, and thy daughters shall be borne on [men's] shoulders.
023	ISA	060	005	Then shalt thou see, and fear, and be amazed in thine heart; for the wealth of the sea shall come round to thee, and of nations and peoples; and herds of camels shall come to thee,
023	ISA	060	006	and the camels of Madiam and Gaepha shall cover thee: all from Saba shall come bearing gold, and shall bring frankincense, and they shall publish the salvation of the Lord.
023	ISA	060	007	And all the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered, and the rams of Nabaeoth shall come; and acceptable sacrifices shall be offered on my altar, and my house of prayer shall be glorified.
023	ISA	060	008	Who are these [that] fly as clouds, and as doves with young ones to me?
023	ISA	060	009	The isles have waited for me, and the ships of Tharsis among the first, to bring thy children from afar, and their silver and their gold with them, and [that] for the sake of the holy name of the Lord, and because the Holy One of Israel is glorified.
023	ISA	060	010	And strangers shall build thy walls, and their kings shall wait upon thee: for by reason of my wrath I smote thee, and by reason of mercy I loved thee.
023	ISA	060	011	And thy gates shall be opened continually; they shall not be shut day nor night; to bring in to thee the power of the Gentiles, and their kings as captives.
023	ISA	060	012	For the nations and the kings which will not serve thee shall perish; and those nations shall be made utterly desolate.
023	ISA	060	013	And the glory of Libanus shall come to thee, with the cypress, and pine, and cedar together, to glorify my holy place.
023	ISA	060	014	And the sons of them that afflicted thee, and of them that provoked thee, shall come to thee in fear; and thou shalt be called Sion, the city of the Holy One of Israel.
023	ISA	060	015	Because thou has become desolate and hated, and there was no helper, therefore I will make thee a perpetual gladness, a joy of many generations.
023	ISA	060	016	And thou shalt suck the milk of the Gentiles, and shalt eat the wealth of kings: and shalt know that I am the Lord that saves thee and delivers thee, the Holy One of Israel.
023	ISA	060	017	And for brass I will bring thee gold, and for iron I will bring thee silver, and instead of wood I will bring thee brass, and instead of stones, iron; and I will make thy princes peaceable, and thine overseers righteous.
023	ISA	060	018	And injustice shall no more be heard in thy land, nor destruction nor misery in thy coasts; but thy walls shall be called Salvation, and thy gates Sculptured Work.
023	ISA	060	019	And thou shalt no more have the sun for a light by day, nor shall the rising of the moon lighten thy night; but the Lord shall be thine everlasting light, and God thy glory.
023	ISA	060	020	For the sun shall no more set, nor shall the moon be eclipsed; for the Lord shall be thine everlasting light, and the days of thy mourning shall be completed.
023	ISA	060	021	Thy people also shall be all righteous; they shall inherit the land for ever, preserving that which they have planted, [even] the works of their hands, for glory.
023	ISA	060	022	The little one shall become thousands, and the least a great nation; I the Lord will gather them in [due] time.
023	ISA	061	001	The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me; he has sent me to preach glad tidings to the poor, to heal the broken in heart, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and recovery of sight to the blind;
023	ISA	061	002	to declare the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of recompence; to comfort all that mourn;
023	ISA	061	003	that there should be given to them that mourn in Sion glory instead of ashes, the oil of joy to the mourners, the garment of glory for the spirit of heaviness: and they shall be called generations of righteousness, the planting of the Lord for glory.
023	ISA	061	004	And they shall build the old waste places, they shall raise up those that were before made desolate, and shall renew the desert cities, [even] those that had been desolate for [many] generations.
023	ISA	061	005	And strangers shall come and feed thy flocks, and aliens [shall be thy] ploughmen and vine-dressers.
023	ISA	061	006	But ye shall be called priests of the Lord, the ministers of God: ye shall eat the strength of nations, and shall be admired because of their wealth.
023	ISA	061	007	Thus shall they inherit the land a second time, and everlasting joy shall be upon their head.
023	ISA	061	008	For I am the Lord who love righteousness, and hate robberies of injustice; and I will give their labour to the just, and will make an everlasting covenant with them.
023	ISA	061	009	And their seed shall be known among the Gentiles, and their offspring in the midst of peoples: every one that sees them shall take notice of them, that they are a seed blessed of God;
023	ISA	061	010	and they shall greatly rejoice in the Lord. Let my soul rejoice in the Lord; for he has clothed me with the robe of salvation, and the garment of joy: he has put a mitre on me as on a bridegroom, and adorned me with ornaments as a bride.
023	ISA	061	011	And as the earth putting forth her flowers, and as a garden its seed; so shall the Lord, [even] the Lord, cause righteousness to spring forth, and exultation before all nations.
023	ISA	062	001	For Sion's sake I will not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest, until her righteousness go forth as light, and my salvation burn as a torch.
023	ISA	062	002	And the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness, and kings thy glory: and one shall call thee [by] a new name, which the Lord shall name.
023	ISA	062	003	And thou shalt be a crown of beauty in the hand of the Lord, and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God.
023	ISA	062	004	And thou shalt no more be called Forsaken; and thy land shall no more be called Desert: for thou shalt be called My Pleasure, and thy land Inhabited: for the Lord has taken pleasure in thee, and thy land shall be inhabited.
023	ISA	062	005	And as a young man lives with a virgin, so shall thy sons dwell in [thee]: and it shall come to pass [that] as a bridegroom will rejoice over a bride, so will the Lord rejoice over thee.
023	ISA	062	006	And on thy walls, O Jerusalem, have I set watchmen all day and all night, who shall never cease making mention of the Lord.
023	ISA	062	007	For there is none like you, when he shall have established, and made Jerusalem a praise on the earth.
023	ISA	062	008	For the Lord has sworn by his glory, and by the might of his arm, I will no more give thy corn and thy provisions to thine enemies; nor shall strangers any more drink thy wine, for which thou has laboured.
023	ISA	062	009	But they that have gathered them shall eat them, and they shall praise the Lord; and they that have gathered [the grapes] shall drink thereof in my holy courts.
023	ISA	062	010	Go through my gates, and make a way for my people; and cast the stones out of the way; lift up a standard for the Gentiles.
023	ISA	062	011	For behold, the Lord has proclaimed to the end of the earth, say ye to the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy Saviour has come to thee, having his reward and his work before his face.
023	ISA	062	012	And one shall call them the holy people, the redeemed of the Lord: and thou shalt be called a city sought out, and not forsaken.
023	ISA	063	001	Who is this that is come from Edom, [with] red garments from Bosor? thus fair in his apparel, with mighty strength? I speak of righteousness and saving judgment.
023	ISA	063	002	Wherefore are thy garments red, and thy raiment as [if fresh] from a trodden winepress?
023	ISA	063	003	I am full of trodden [grape], and of the nations there is not a man with me; and I trampled them in my fury, and dashed them to pieces as earth, and brought down their blood to the earth.
023	ISA	063	004	For the day of recompence has come upon them, and the year of redemption is at hand.
023	ISA	063	005	And I looked, and there was no helper; and I observed, and none upheld: therefore my arm delivered them, and mine anger drew nigh.
023	ISA	063	006	And I trampled them in mine anger, and brought down their blood to the earth.
023	ISA	063	007	I remembered the mercy of the Lord, the praises of the Lord in all things wherein he recompenses us. The Lord is a good judge to the house of Israel; he deals with us according to his mercy, and according to the abundance of his righteousness.
023	ISA	063	008	And he said, Is it not my people? the children surely will not be rebellious: and he became to them deliverance
023	ISA	063	009	out of all their affliction: not an ambassador, nor a messenger, but himself saved them, because he loved them and spared them: he himself redeemed them, and took them up, and lifted them up all the days of old.
023	ISA	063	010	But they disobeyed, and provoked his Holy Spirit: so he turned to be an enemy, he himself contended against them.
023	ISA	063	011	Then he remembered the ancient days, [saying], Where is he that brought up from the sea the shepherd of the sheep? where is he that put his Holy Spirit in them?
023	ISA	063	012	who led Moses with his right hand, the arm of his glory? he forced the water [to separate] from before him, to make himself an everlasting name.
023	ISA	063	013	He led them through the deep, as a horse through the wilderness, and they fainted not,
023	ISA	063	014	and as cattle through a plain: the Spirit came down from the Lord, and guided them: thus thou leddest thy people, to make thyself a glorious name.
023	ISA	063	015	Turn from heaven, and look from thy holy habitation and [from] thy glory: where is thy zeal and thy strength? where is the abundance of thy mercy and of thy compassions, that thou hast withholden thyself from us?
023	ISA	063	016	For thou art our Father; for [though] Abraham knew us not, and Israel did not acknowledge us, yet do thou, O Lord, our Father, deliver us: thy name has been upon us from the beginning.
023	ISA	063	017	Why hast thou caused us to err, O Lord, from thy way? [and] has hardened our hearts, that we should not fear thee? Return for thy servants' sake, for the sake of the tribes of thine inheritance,
023	ISA	063	018	that we may inherit a small part of thy holy mountain.
023	ISA	063	019	We are become as at the beginning, when thou didst not rule over us, and thy name was not called upon us.
023	ISA	064	001	If thou wouldest open the heaven, trembling will take hold upon the mountains from thee, and they shall melt,
023	ISA	064	002	as wax melts before the fire; and fire shall burn up the enemies, and thy name shall be manifest among the adversaries: at thy presence the nations shall be troubled,
023	ISA	064	003	whenever thou shalt work gloriously; trembling from thee shall take hold upon the mountains.
023	ISA	064	004	From of old we have not heard, neither have our eyes seen a God beside thee, and thy works which thou wilt perform to them that wait for mercy.
023	ISA	064	005	For [these blessings] shall happen to them that work righteousness, and they shall remember thy ways: behold, thou wast angry and we have sinned; therefore we have erred,
023	ISA	064	006	and we are all become as unclean, and all our righteousness as a filthy rag: and we have fallen as leaves because of our iniquities; thus the wind shall carry us [away].
023	ISA	064	007	And there is none that calls upon thy name, or that remembers to take hold on thee: for thou hast turned thy face away from us, and hast delivered us up because of our sins.
023	ISA	064	008	And now, O Lord, thou art our Father, and we are clay, all [of us] the work of thine hands.
023	ISA	064	009	Be not very wroth with us, and remember not our sins for ever; but now look on [us], for we are all thy people.
023	ISA	064	010	The city of thy holiness has become desolate, Sion has become as a wilderness, Jerusalem a curse.
023	ISA	064	011	The house, our sanctuary, and the glory which our fathers blessed, has been burnt with fire: and all our glorious things have gone to ruin.
023	ISA	064	012	And for all these things thou, O Lord, has withholden, thyself, and been silent, and hast brought us very low.
023	ISA	065	001	I became manifest to them that asked not for me; I was found of them that sought me not: I said, Behold, I am [here], to a nation, who called not on my name.
023	ISA	065	002	I have stretched forth my hands all day to a disobedient and gainsaying people, to them that walked in a way that was not good, but after their sins.
023	ISA	065	003	This is the people that provokes me continually in my presence; they offer sacrifices in gardens, and burn incense on bricks to devils, which exist not.
023	ISA	065	004	They lie down to sleep in the tombs and in the caves for the sake of dreams, [even] they that eat swine's flesh, and the broth of [their] sacrifices: all their vessels are defiled:
023	ISA	065	005	who say, Depart from me, draw not nigh to me, for I am pure. This is the smoke of my wrath, a fire burns with it continually.
023	ISA	065	006	Behold, it is written before me: I will not be silent until I have recompensed into their bosom,
023	ISA	065	007	their sins and [the sins] of their fathers, saith the Lord, who have burnt incense on the mountains, and reproached me on the hills: I will recompense their works into their bosom.
023	ISA	065	008	Thus saith the Lord, As a grape-stone shall be found in the cluster, and they shall say, Destroy it not; for a blessing is in it: so will I do for the sake of him that serves me, for his sake I will not destroy [them] all.
023	ISA	065	009	And I will lead forth the seed [that came] of Jacob and of Juda, and they shall inherit my holy mountain: and mine elect and my servants shall inherit it, and shall dwell there.
023	ISA	065	010	And there shall be in the forest folds of flocks, and the valley of Achor [shall] be for a resting-place of herds for my people, who have sought me.
023	ISA	065	011	But ye are they that have left me, and forget my holy mountain, and prepare a table for the devil, and fill up the drink-offering to Fortune.
023	ISA	065	012	I will deliver you up to the sword, ye shall all fall by slaughter: for I called you, and ye hearkened not; I spoke, and ye refused to hear; and ye did evil in my sight, and chose the things wherein I delighted not.
023	ISA	065	013	Therefore thus saith the Lord, Behold, my servants shall eat, but ye shall hunger: behold, my servants shall drink, but ye shall thirst: behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be ashamed:
023	ISA	065	014	behold, my servants shall exult with joy, but ye shall cry for the sorrow of your heart, and shall howl for the vexation of your spirit.
023	ISA	065	015	For ye shall leave your name for a loathing to my chosen, and the Lord shall destroy you: but my servants shall be called by a new name,
023	ISA	065	016	which shall be blessed on the earth; for they shall bless the true God: and they that swear upon the earth shall swear by the true God; for they shall forget the former affliction, it shall not come into their mind.
023	ISA	065	017	For there shall be a new heaven and a new earth: and they shall not at all remember the former, neither shall they at all come into their mind.
023	ISA	065	018	But they shall find in her joy and exultation; for, behold, I make Jerusalem a rejoicing, and my people a joy.
023	ISA	065	019	And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and will be glad in my people: and there shall no more be heard in her the voice of weeping, or the voice of crying.
023	ISA	065	020	Neither shall there be there any more a [child that dies] untimely, or an old man who shall not complete his time: for the youth shall be a hundred years [old], and the sinner who dies at a hundred years shall also be accursed:
023	ISA	065	021	and they shall build houses, and themselves shall dwell in [them]; and they shall plant vineyards, and themselves shall eat the fruit thereof.
023	ISA	065	022	They shall by no means build, and others inhabit; and they shall by no means plant, and others eat: for as the days of the tree of life shall be the days of my people, they shall long enjoy the fruits of their labours.
023	ISA	065	023	My chosen shall not toil in vain, neither shall they beget children to be cursed; for they are a seed blessed of God, and their offspring with them.
023	ISA	065	024	And it shall come to pass, [that] before they call, I will hearken to them; while they are yet speaking, I will say, What is it?
023	ISA	065	025	Then wolves and lambs shall feed together, and the lion shall eat chaff like the ox, and the serpent earth as bread. They shall not injure nor destroy in my holy mountain, saith the Lord.
023	ISA	066	001	Thus saith the Lord, Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool: what kind of a house will ye build me? and of what kind [is to be] the place of my rest?
023	ISA	066	002	For all these things are mine, saith the Lord: and to whom will I have respect, but to the humble and meek, and the [man] that trembles [at] my words?
023	ISA	066	003	But the transgressor that sacrifices a calf to me, is as he that kills a dog; and he that offers fine flour, as [one that offers] swine's blood; he that gives frankincense for a memorial, is as a blasphemer. Yet they have chosen their own ways, and their soul has delighted in their abominations.
023	ISA	066	004	I also will choose their mockeries, and will recompense their sins upon them; because I called them, and they did not hearken to me; I spoke, and they heard not: and they did evil before me, and chose the things wherein I delighted not.
023	ISA	066	005	Hear the words of the Lord, ye that tremble at his word; speak ye, our brethren, to them that hate you and abominate you, that the name of the Lord may be glorified, and may appear their joy; but they shall be ashamed.
023	ISA	066	006	A voice of a cry from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of the Lord rendering recompence to [his] adversaries.
023	ISA	066	007	Before she that travailed brought forth, before the travail-pain came on, she escaped [it] and brought forth a male.
023	ISA	066	008	Who has heard such a thing? and who has seen after this manner? Has the earth travailed in one day? or has even a nation been born at once, that Sion has travailed, and brought forth her children?
023	ISA	066	009	But I have raised this expectation, yet thou hast not remembered me, saith the Lord: behold, have not I made the bearing and barren woman? saith thy God.
023	ISA	066	010	Rejoice, O Jerusalem, and all ye that love her hold in her a general assembly: rejoice greatly with her, all that [now] mourn over her:
023	ISA	066	011	that ye may suck, and be satisfied with the breast of her consolation; that ye may milk out, and delight yourselves with the influx of her glory.
023	ISA	066	012	For thus saith the Lord, Behold, I turn toward them as a river of peace, and as a torrent bringing upon them in a flood the glory of the Gentiles: their children shall be borne upon the shoulders, and comforted on the knees.
023	ISA	066	013	As if his mother should comfort one, so will I also comfort you; and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem.
023	ISA	066	014	And ye shall see, and your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall thrive like grass: and the hand of the Lord shall be known to them that fear him, and he shall threaten the disobedient.
023	ISA	066	015	For, behold, the Lord will come as fire, and his chariots as a storm, to render his vengeance with wrath, and his rebuke with a flame of fire.
023	ISA	066	016	For with the fire of the Lord all the earth shall be judged, and all flesh with his sword: many shall be slain by the Lord.
023	ISA	066	017	They that sanctify themselves and purify themselves in the gardens, and eat swine's flesh in the porches, and the abominations, and the mouse, shall be consumed together, saith the Lord.
023	ISA	066	018	And I [know] their works and their imagination. I am going to gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come, and see my glory.
023	ISA	066	019	And I will leave a sign upon them, and I will send forth them that have escaped of them to the nations, to Tharsis, and Phud, and Lud, and Mosoch, and to Thobel, and to Greece, and to the isles afar off, to those who have not heard my name, nor seen my glory; and they shall declare my glory among the Gentiles.
023	ISA	066	020	And they shall bring your brethren out of all nations for a gift to the Lord with horses, and chariots, in litters [drawn by] mules with awnings, to the holy city Jerusalem, said the Lord, as though the children of Israel should bring their sacrifices to me with psalms into the house of the Lord.
023	ISA	066	021	And I will take of them priests and Levites, saith the Lord.
023	ISA	066	022	For as the new heaven and the new earth, which I make, remain before me, saith the Lord, so shall your seed and your name continue.
023	ISA	066	023	And it shall come to pass from month to month, and from sabbath to sabbath, [that] all flesh shall come to worship before me in Jerusalem, saith the Lord.
023	ISA	066	024	And they shall go forth, and see the carcasses of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, and their fire shall not be quenched; and they shall be a spectacle to all flesh.

# BOOK	024	JER	Jeremiah	Jeremias
024	JER	001	001	The word of God which came to Jeremias the [son] of Chelcias, of the priests, who dwelt in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:
024	JER	001	002	[accordingly] as the word of God came to him in the days of Josias son of Amos king of Juda, in the thirteenth year of his reign.
024	JER	001	003	And it was in the days of Joakim, son of Josias king of Juda, until the eleventh year of Sedekias king of Juda, [even] until the captivity of Jerusalem in the fifth month.
024	JER	001	004	And the word of the Lord came to him, [saying],
024	JER	001	005	Before I formed thee in the belly, I knew thee; and before thou camest forth from the womb, I sanctified thee; I appointed thee a prophet to the nations.
024	JER	001	006	And I said, O Lord, thou that art supreme Lord, behold, I know not [how] to speak, for I am a child.
024	JER	001	007	And the Lord said to me, Say not, I am a child: for thou shalt go to all to whomsoever I shall send thee, and according to all [the words] that I shall command thee, thou shalt speak.
024	JER	001	008	Be not afraid before them: for I am with thee to deliver thee, saith the Lord.
024	JER	001	009	And the Lord stretched forth his hand to me, and touched my mouth: and the Lord said to me, Behold, I have put my words into thy mouth.
024	JER	001	010	Behold, I have appointed thee this day over nations and over kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to rebuild, and to plant.
024	JER	001	011	And the word of the Lord came to me, saying, What seest thou? And I said, A rod of an almond tree.
024	JER	001	012	And the Lord said to me, Thou hast well seen: for I have watched over my words to perform them.
024	JER	001	013	And the word of the Lord came to me a second time, saying, What seest thou? And I said, A caldron on the fire; and the face of it is toward the north.
024	JER	001	014	And the Lord said to me, From the north shall flame forth evils upon all the inhabitants of the land.
024	JER	001	015	For, behold, I call together all the kingdoms of the earth from the north, saith the Lord; and they shall come, and shall set each one his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all the walls round about her, and against all the cities of Juda.
024	JER	001	016	And I will speak to them in judgment, concerning all their iniquity, [forasmuch] as they have forsaken me, and sacrificed to strange gods, and worshipped the works of their own hands.
024	JER	001	017	And do thou gird up thy loins, and stand up, and speak all [the words] that I shall command thee: be not afraid of their face, neither be thou alarmed before them; for I am with thee to deliver thee, saith the Lord.
024	JER	001	018	Behold, I have made thee this day as a strong city, and as a brazen wall, strong [against] all the kings of Juda, and the princes thereof, and the people of the land.
024	JER	001	019	And they shall fight against thee; but they shall by no means prevail against thee; because I am with thee, to deliver thee, saith the Lord.
024	JER	002	001	And he said, Thus saith the Lord,
024	JER	002	002	I remember the kindness of thy youth, and the love of thine espousals,
024	JER	002	003	in following the Holy One of Israel, saith the Lord, Israel was the holy [people] to the Lord, [and] the first-fruits of his increase: all that devoured him shall offend; evils shall come upon them, saith the Lord.
024	JER	002	004	Hear the word of the Lord, O house of Jacob, and every family of the house of Israel.
024	JER	002	005	Thus saith the Lord, What trespass have your fathers found in me, that they have revolted far from me, and gone after vanities, and become vain?
024	JER	002	006	And they said not, Where is the Lord, who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, who guided us in the wilderness, in an untried and trackless land, in a land which no man at all went through, and no man dwelt there?
024	JER	002	007	And I brought you to Carmel, that ye should eat the fruits thereof, and the good thereof; and ye went in, and defiled my land, and made mine heritage an abomination.
024	JER	002	008	The priests said not, Where is the Lord? and they that held by the law knew me not: the shepherds also sinned against me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and went after that which profited not.
024	JER	002	009	Therefore I will yet plead with you, and will plead with your children's children.
024	JER	002	010	For go to the isles of the Chettians, and se; and send to Kedar, and observe accurately, and see if such things have been done;
024	JER	002	011	if the nations will change their gods, though they are not gods: but my people have changed their glory, [for that] from which they shall not be profited.
024	JER	002	012	The heaven is amazed at this, and is very exceedingly horror-struck, saith the Lord.
024	JER	002	013	For my people has committed two [faults], and evil ones: they have forsaken me, the fountain of water of life, and hewn out for themselves broken cisterns, which will not be able to hold water.
024	JER	002	014	Is Israel a servant, or a home-born slave? why has he become a spoil?
024	JER	002	015	The lions roared upon him, and uttered their voice, which have made his land a wilderness: and his cities are broken down, that they should not be inhabited.
024	JER	002	016	Also the children of Memphis and Taphnas have known thee, and mocked thee.
024	JER	002	017	Has not thy forsaking me brought these things upon thee? saith the Lord thy God.
024	JER	002	018	And now what hast thou to do with the way of Egypt, to drink the water of Geon? and what hast thou to do with the way of the Assyrians, to drink the water of rivers?
024	JER	002	019	Thine apostasy shall correct thee, and thy wickedness shall reprove thee: know then, and see, that thy forsaking me [has been] bitter to thee, saith the Lord thy God; and I have taken no pleasure in thee, saith the Lord thy God.
024	JER	002	020	For of old thou hast broken thy yoke, and plucked asunder thy bands; and thou has said, I will not serve thee, but will go upon every high hill, and under every shady tree, there will I indulge in my fornication.
024	JER	002	021	Yet I planted thee a fruitful vine, entirely of the right sort: how art thou a strange vine turned to bitterness!
024	JER	002	022	Though thou shouldest wash thyself with nitre, and multiply to thyself soap, [still] thou art stained by thine iniquities before me, saith the Lord.
024	JER	002	023	How wilt thou say, I am not polluted, and have not gone after Baal? behold thy ways in the burial-ground, and know what thou hast done: her voice has howled in the evening:
024	JER	002	024	she has extended her ways over the waters of the desert; she was hurried along by the lusts of her soul; she is given up [to them], who will turn her back? none that seek her shall be weary; at [the time of] her humiliation they shall find her.
024	JER	002	025	Withdraw thy foot from a rough way, and thy throat from thirst: but she said I will strengthen myself: for she loved strangers, and went after them.
024	JER	002	026	As is the shame of a thief when he is caught, so shall the children of Israel be ashamed; they, and their kings, and their princes, and their priests, and their prophets.
024	JER	002	027	They said to a stock, Thou art my father; and to a stone, Thou has begotten me: and they have turned [their] backs to me, and not their faces: yet in the time of their afflictions they will say, Arise, and save us.
024	JER	002	028	And where are thy gods, which thou madest for thyself? will they arise and save in the time of thine affliction? for according to the number of thy cities were thy gods, O Juda; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem they sacrificed to Baal.
024	JER	002	029	Wherefore do ye speak unto me? ye all have been ungodly, and ye all have transgressed against me, saith the Lord.
024	JER	002	030	In vain have I smitten your children; ye have not received correction: a sword has devoured your prophets as a destroying lion; yet ye feared not.
024	JER	002	031	Hear ye the word of the Lord: thus saith the Lord, Have I been a wilderness or a dry land to Israel? wherefore has my people said, We will not be ruled over, and will not come to thee any more?
024	JER	002	032	Will a bride forget her ornaments, or a virgin her girdle? but my people has forgotten me days without number.
024	JER	002	033	What fair device wilt thou yet employ in thy ways, so as to seek love? [it shall] not [be] so; moreover thou has done wickedly in corrupting thy ways;
024	JER	002	034	and in thine hands has been found the blood of innocent souls; I have not found them in holes, but on every oak.
024	JER	002	035	Yet thou saidst, I am innocent: only let his wrath be turned away from me. Behold, I [will] plead with thee, whereas thou sayest, I have not sinned.
024	JER	002	036	For thou has been so exceedingly contemptuous as to repeat thy ways; but thou shalt be ashamed of Egypt, as thou wast ashamed of Assur.
024	JER	002	037	For thou shalt go forth thence also with thine hands upon thine head; for the Lord has rejected thine hope, and thou shalt not prosper in it.
024	JER	003	001	If a man put away his wife, and she depart from him, and become another man's, shall she return to him any more at all? shall not that woman be utterly defiled? ye thou hast gone a-whoring with many shepherds, and hast returned to me, saith the Lord.
024	JER	003	002	Lift up thine eyes [to look] straight forward, and see where thou hast not been utterly defiled. Thou hast sat for them by the wayside as a deserted crow, and hast defiled the land with thy fornications and thy wickedness.
024	JER	003	003	And thou didst retain many shepherds for a stumbling-block to thyself: thou hadst a whore's face, thou didst become shameless toward all.
024	JER	003	004	Hast thou not called me as it were a home, and the father and guide of thy virgin-time?
024	JER	003	005	Will [God's anger] continue for ever, or be preserved to the end? Behold, thou hast spoken and done these bad things, and hadst power [to do them].
024	JER	003	006	And the Lord said to me in the days of Josias the king, Hast thou seen what things the house of Israel has done to me? they have gone on every high mountain, and under every shady tree, and have committed fornication there.
024	JER	003	007	And I said after she had committed all these acts of fornication, Turn again to me. Yet she returned not. And faithless Juda saw her faithlessness.
024	JER	003	008	And I saw that (for all the sins of which she was convicted, wherein the house of Israel committed adultery, and I put her away, and gave into her hands a bill of divorcement,) yet faithless Juda feared not, but went and herself also committed fornication.
024	JER	003	009	And her fornication was nothing accounted of; and she committed adultery with wood and stone.
024	JER	003	010	And for all these things faithless Juda turned not to me with all her heart, but falsely.
024	JER	003	011	And the Lord said to me, Israel has justified himself more than faithless Juda.
024	JER	003	012	Go and read these words toward the north, and thou shalt say, Return to me, O house of Israel, saith the Lord; and I will not set my face against you: for I am merciful, saith the Lord, and I will not be angry with you for ever.
024	JER	003	013	Nevertheless, know thine iniquity, that thou hast sinned against the Lord thy God, and hast scattered thy ways to strangers under every shady tree, but thou didst not hearken to my voice, saith the Lord.
024	JER	003	014	Turn, ye children that have revolted, saith the Lord; for I will rule over you: and I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you in to Sion:
024	JER	003	015	and I will give you shepherds after my heart, and they shall certainly tend you with knowledge.
024	JER	003	016	And it shall come to pass that when ye are multiplied and increased upon the land, saith the Lord, in those days they shall say no more, The ark of the covenant of the Holy One of Israel: it shall not come to mind; it shall not be named; neither shall it be visited; nor shall [this] be done any more.
024	JER	003	017	In those days and at that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the Lord; and all the nations shall be gathered to it: and they shall not walk any more after the imaginations of their evil heart.
024	JER	003	018	In those days the house of Juda, shall come together to the house of Israel, and they shall come, together, from the land of the north, and from all the countries, to the land, which I caused their fathers to inherit.
024	JER	003	019	And I said, So be it, Lord, for [thou saidst] I will set thee among children, and will give thee a choice land, the inheritance of the Almighty God of the Gentiles: and I said, Ye shall call me Father; and ye shall not turn away from me.
024	JER	003	020	But as a wife acts treacherously against her husband, so has the house of Israel dealt treacherously against me, saith the Lord.
024	JER	003	021	A voice from the lips was heard, [even] of weeping and supplication of the children of Israel: for they have dealt unrighteously in their ways, they have forgotten God their Holy One.
024	JER	003	022	Turn, ye children that are given to turning, and I will heal your bruises. Behold, we will be thy servants; for thou art the Lord our God.
024	JER	003	023	Truly the hills and the strength of the mountains were a lying refuge: but by the Lord our God is the salvation of Israel.
024	JER	003	024	But shame has consumed the labours of our fathers from our youth; their sheep and their calves, and their sons and their daughters.
024	JER	003	025	We have lain down in our shame, and our disgrace has covered us: because we and our fathers have sinned before our God, from our youth until this day; and we have not hearkened to the voice of the Lord our God.
024	JER	004	001	If Israel will return to me, saith the Lord, he shall return: and if he will remove his abominations out of his mouth, and fear before me, and swear,
024	JER	004	002	The Lord lives, with truth, in judgment and righteousness, then shall nations bless by him, and by him they shall praise God in Jerusalem.
024	JER	004	003	For thus saith the Lord to the men of Juda, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Break up fresh ground for yourselves, and sow not among thorns.
024	JER	004	004	Circumcise yourselves to your God, and circumcise your hardness of heart, ye men of Juda, and inhabitants of Jerusalem: lest my wrath go forth as fire, and burn, and there be none to quench it, because of the evil of your devices.
024	JER	004	005	Declare ye in Juda, and let it be heard in Jerusalem: say ye, Sound the trumpet in the land; cry ye aloud: say ye, Gather yourselves together, and let us enter into the fortified cities.
024	JER	004	006	Gather up [your wares] and flee to Sion: hasten, stay not: for I will bring evils from the north, and great destruction.
024	JER	004	007	The lion is gone up from his lair, he has roused [himself] to the destruction of the nations, and has gone forth out of his place, to make the land desolate; and the cities shall be destroyed, so as to be without inhabitant.
024	JER	004	008	For these things gird yourselves with sackclothes, and lament, and howl: for the anger of the Lord is not turned away from you.
024	JER	004	009	And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord, that the heart of the king shall perish, and the heart of the princes; and the priests shall be amazed, and the prophets shall wonder.
024	JER	004	010	And I said, O sovereign Lord, verily thou hast deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, There shall be peace; whereas behold, the sword has reached even to their soul.
024	JER	004	011	At that time they shall say to this people and to Jerusalem, [There is] a spirit of error in the wilderness: the way of the daughter of my people is not to purity, nor to holiness.
024	JER	004	012	[But] a spirit of full vengeance shall come upon me; and now I declare my judgments against them.
024	JER	004	013	Behold, he shall come up as a cloud, and his chariots as a tempest: his horses are swifter than eagles. Woe unto us! for we are in misery.
024	JER	004	014	Cleanse thine heart from wickedness, O Jerusalem, that thou mayest be saved: how long will thy grievous thoughts be within thee?
024	JER	004	015	For a voice of one publishing from Dan shall come, and trouble out of mount Ephraim shall be heard of.
024	JER	004	016	Remind ye the nations; behold, they are come: proclaim [it] in Jerusalem, that bands are approaching from a land afar off, and have uttered their voice against the cities of Juda.
024	JER	004	017	As keepers of a field, they have surrounded her; because thou, saith the Lord, has neglected me.
024	JER	004	018	Thy ways and thy devices have brought these things upon thee; this is thy wickedness, for [it is] bitter, for it has reached to thy heart.
024	JER	004	019	I am pained in my bowels, my bowels, and the sensitive powers of my heart; my soul is in great commotion, my heart is torn: I will not be silent, for my soul has heard the sound of a trumpet, the cry of war, and of distress: it calls on destruction;
024	JER	004	020	for all the land is distressed: suddenly [my] tabernacle is distressed, my curtains have been rent asunder.
024	JER	004	021	How long shall I see fugitives, and hear the sound of the trumpet?
024	JER	004	022	For the princes of my people have not known me, they are foolish and unwise children: they are wise to do evil, but [how] to do good they have not known.
024	JER	004	023	I looked upon the earth, and, behold, [it was] not; and to the sky, an there was no light in it.
024	JER	004	024	I beheld the mountains, and they trembled, and [I saw] all the hills in commotion.
024	JER	004	025	I looked, and behold, there was no man, and all the birds of the sky were scared.
024	JER	004	026	I saw, and, behold, Carmel was desert, and all the cities were burnt with fire at the presence of the Lord, and at the presence of his fierce anger they were utterly destroyed.
024	JER	004	027	Thus saith the Lord, The whole land shall be desolate; but I will not make a full end.
024	JER	004	028	For these things let the earth mourn, and let the sky be dark above: for I have spoken, and I will not repent; I have purposed, and I will not turn back from it.
024	JER	004	029	The whole land has recoiled from the noise of the horseman and the bent bow; they have gone into the caves, and have hidden themselves in the groves, and have gone up upon the rocks: every city was abandoned, no man dwelt in them.
024	JER	004	030	And what wilt thou do? Though thou clothe thyself with scarlet, and adorn thyself with golden ornaments; though thou adorn thine eyes with stibium, thy beauty [will be] in vain: thy lovers have rejected thee, they seek thy life.
024	JER	004	031	For I have heard thy groaning as the voice of a woman in travail, as of her that brings forth her first child; the voice of the daughter of Zion shall fail through weakness, and she shall lose the strength of her hands, [saying], Woe is me! for my soul faints because of the slain.
024	JER	005	001	Run ye about in the streets of Jerusalem, and see, and know, and seek in her broad places, if ye can find [one], if there is any one that does judgment, and seeks faithfulness; and I will pardon them, saith the Lord.
024	JER	005	002	The Lord lives, they say; do they not therefore swear falsely?
024	JER	005	003	O Lord, thine eyes are upon faithfulness: thou hast scourged them, but they have not grieved; thou hast consumed them; but they would not receive correction: they have made their faces harder than a rock; and they would not return.
024	JER	005	004	Then I said, It may be they are poor; for they are weak, for they know not the way of the Lord, or the judgment of God.
024	JER	005	005	I will go to the rich men, and will speak to them; for they have known the way of the Lord, and the judgment of God: but, behold, with one consent they have broken the yoke, they have burst the bonds.
024	JER	005	006	Therefore has a lion out of the forest smitten them, and a wolf has destroyed them even to [their] houses, and a leopard has watched against their cities: all that go forth from them shall be hunted: for they have multiplied their ungodliness, they have strengthened themselves in their revoltings.
024	JER	005	007	In what [way] shall I forgive thee for these things? Thy sons have forsaken me, and sworn by them that are no gods: and I fed them to the full, and they committed adultery, and lodged in harlots' houses.
024	JER	005	008	They became as wanton horses: they neighed each one after his neighbour's wife.
024	JER	005	009	Shall I not visit for these things? saith the Lord: and shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this.
024	JER	005	010	Go up upon her battlements, and break [them] down; but make not a full end: leave her buttresses: for they are the Lord's.
024	JER	005	011	For the house of Israel have indeed dealt treacherously against me, saith the Lord: the house of Juda also
024	JER	005	012	have lied to their Lord, and they have said, These things are not so; no evils shall come upon us; and we shall not see sword or famine.
024	JER	005	013	Our prophets became wind, and the word of the Lord was not in them.
024	JER	005	014	Therefore thus saith the Lord Almighty, Because ye have spoken this word, behold, I have made my words in thy mouth fire, and this people wood, and it shall devour them.
024	JER	005	015	Behold, I [will] bring upon you a nation from far, O house of Israel, saith the Lord; a nation the sound of whose language one shall not understand.
024	JER	005	016	[They are] all mighty men:
024	JER	005	017	and they shall devour your harvest, and your bread; and shall devour your sons, and your daughters; and they shall devour your sheep, and your calves, and devour your vineyards, and your fig-plantations, and your olive yards: and they shall utterly destroy your strong cities, wherein ye trusted, with the sword.
024	JER	005	018	And it shall come to pass in those days, saith the Lord thy God, that I will not utterly destroy you.
024	JER	005	019	And it shall come to pass, when ye shall say, Wherefore has the Lord our God done all these things to us? that thou shalt say to them, Because ye served strange gods in your land, so shall ye serve strangers in a land that is not yours.
024	JER	005	020	Proclaim these things to the house of Jacob, and let them be heard in the house of Juda.
024	JER	005	021	Hear ye now these things, O foolish and senseless people; who have eyes, and see not; and have ears, and hear not:
024	JER	005	022	will ye not be afraid of me? saith the Lord; and will ye not fear before me, who have set the sand for a bound to the sea, [as] a perpetual ordinance, and it shall not pass it: yea, it shall rage, but not prevail; and its waves shall roar, but not pass over it.
024	JER	005	023	But this people has a disobedient and rebellious heart; and they have turned aside and gone back:
024	JER	005	024	and they have not said in their heart, Let us fear now the Lord our God, who gives us the early and latter rain, according to the season of the fulfillment of the ordinance of harvest, and has preserved [it] for us.
024	JER	005	025	Your transgressions have turned away these things, and your sins have removed good things from you.
024	JER	005	026	For among my people were found ungodly men; and they have set snares to destroy men, and have caught [them].
024	JER	005	027	As a snare which has been set is full of birds, so are their houses full of deceit: therefore have they grown great, and become rich:
024	JER	005	028	and they have transgressed [the rule of] judgment; they have not judged the cause of the orphan, nor have they judged the cause of the widow.
024	JER	005	029	Shall I not visit for these things? saith the Lord: and shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?
024	JER	005	030	Shocking and horrible deeds have been done on the land;
024	JER	005	031	the prophets utter unrighteous prophecies, and the priests have clapped their hands: and my people has loved [to have it] thus: and what will ye do for the future.
024	JER	006	001	Strengthen yourselves, ye children of Benjamin, [to flee] out of the midst of Jerusalem, and sound an alarm with the trumpet in Thecue, and set up a signal over Baethacharma: for evil threatens from the north, and a great destruction is coming.
024	JER	006	002	And [thy] pride, O daughter of Sion, shall be taken away.
024	JER	006	003	The shepherds and their flocks shall come to her; and they shall pitch [their] tents against her round about, and shall feed [their flocks] each with his hand.
024	JER	006	004	Prepare yourselves for war against her; rise up, and let us go up against her at noon. Woe to us! for the day has gone down, for the shadows of the day fail.
024	JER	006	005	Rise, and let us go up against her by night, and destroy her foundations.
024	JER	006	006	For thus saith the Lord, Hew down her trees, array a numerous force against Jerusalem. O false city; [there is] all oppression in her.
024	JER	006	007	As a cistern cools water, so her wickedness cools her, ungodliness and misery shall be heard in her, [as] continually before her.
024	JER	006	008	Thou shalt be chastened, O Jerusalem, with pain and the scourge, lest my soul depart from thee; lest I make thee a desert land, which shall not be inhabited.
024	JER	006	009	For thus saith the Lord, Glean, glean thoroughly as a vine the remnant of Israel: turn back [your hands] as a grape-gatherer to his basket.
024	JER	006	010	To whom shall I speak, and testify, that he may hearken? behold, thine ears are uncircumcised, and they shall not be able to hear: behold, the word of the Lord is become to them a reproach, they will not at all desire it.
024	JER	006	011	And I allowed my wrath to come to full, yet I kept [it] in, and did not utterly destroy them: I will pour it out on the children without, and on the assembly of young men together: for man and woman shall be taken together, the old man with him that is full of days.
024	JER	006	012	And their houses shall be turned to others, [with] their fields and their wives together: for I will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of this land, saith the Lord.
024	JER	006	013	For from the least of them even to the greatest they have all committed iniquity; from the priest even to the false prophet they have all wrought falsely.
024	JER	006	014	And they healed the breach of my people [imperfectly], making light [of it], and saying, Peace, peace, and where is peace?
024	JER	006	015	They were ashamed because they failed; yet they were not ashamed as those who are [truly] ashamed, and they knew not their own disgrace: therefore shall they [utterly] fall when they do fall, and in the time of visitation shall they perish, said the Lord.
024	JER	006	016	Thus saith the Lord, Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths of the Lord; and see what is the good way, and walk in it, and ye shall find purification for your souls. But they said, We will not walk [in them].
024	JER	006	017	I have set watchmen over you, [saying], Hear ye the sound of the trumpet. But they said, We will not hear [it].
024	JER	006	018	Therefore have the nations heard, and they that feed their flocks.
024	JER	006	019	Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evils upon this people, [even] the fruit of their rebellions; for they have not heeded my words, and they have rejected my law.
024	JER	006	020	Wherefore do ye bring me frankincense from Saba, and cinnamon from a land afar off? your whole-burnt-offerings are not acceptable, and your sacrifices have not been pleasant to me.
024	JER	006	021	Therefore thus saith the Lord, Behold, I [will] bring weakness upon this people, and the fathers and sons shall be weak together; the neighbour and his friend shall perish.
024	JER	006	022	Thus saith the Lord, Behold, a people comes from the north, and nations shall be stirred up from the end of the earth.
024	JER	006	023	They shall lay hold on bow and spear; [the people] is fierce, and will have no mercy; their voice is as the roaring sea; they shall array themselves for war against thee as fire on horses and chariots, O daughter of Sion.
024	JER	006	024	We have heard the report of them: our hands are weakened: anguish has seized us, the pangs as of a woman in travail.
024	JER	006	025	Go not forth into the field, and walk not in the ways; for the sword of the enemy lingers round about.
024	JER	006	026	O daughter of my people, gird thyself with sackcloth: sprinkle [thyself] with ashes; make for thyself pitiable lamentation, [as] the mourning for a beloved [son]: for misery will come suddenly upon you.
024	JER	006	027	I have caused thee to be tried among tried nations, and thou shalt know me when I have tried their way.
024	JER	006	028	[They are] all disobedient, walking perversely: [they are] brass and iron; they are all corrupted.
024	JER	006	029	The bellows have failed from the fire, the lead has failed: the silversmith works at his trade in vain; their wickedness is not consumed.
024	JER	006	030	Call ye them reprobate silver, because the Lord has rejected them.
024	JER	007	001	Hear ye the word of the Lord, all Judea.
024	JER	007	003	Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Correct your ways and your devices, and I will cause you to dwell in this place.
024	JER	007	004	Trust not in yourselves with lying words, for they shall not profit you at all, saying, It is the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord.
024	JER	007	005	For if ye thoroughly correct your ways and your practices, and do indeed execute judgment between a man and his neighbour;
024	JER	007	006	and oppress not the stranger, and the orphan, and the widow, and shed not innocent blood in this place, and go not after strange gods to your hurt:
024	JER	007	007	then will I cause you to dwell in this place, in the land which I gave to your fathers of old and for ever.
024	JER	007	008	But whereas ye have trusted in lying words, whereby ye shall not be profited;
024	JER	007	009	and ye murder, and commit adultery, and steal, and swear falsely, and burn incense to Baal, and are gone after strange gods whom ye know not,
024	JER	007	010	so that it is evil with you; yet have ye come, and stood before me in the house, whereon my name is called, and ye have said, We have refrained from doing all these abominations.
024	JER	007	011	Is my house, whereon my name is called, a den of robbers in your eyes? And, behold, I have seen [it], saith the Lord.
024	JER	007	012	For go ye to my place with is in Selo, where I caused my name to dwell before, and see what I did to it because of the wickedness of my people Israel.
024	JER	007	013	And now, because ye have done all these deeds, and I spoke to you, but ye hearkened not to me; and I called you, but ye answered not;
024	JER	007	014	therefore I also will do to the house whereon my name is called, wherein ye trust, and to the place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I did to Selo.
024	JER	007	015	And I will cast you out of my sight, as I cast away your brethren, all the seed of Ephraim.
024	JER	007	016	Therefore pray not thou for this people, and intercede not for them to be pitied, yea, pray not, and approach me not for them: for I will not hearken [unto thee].
024	JER	007	017	Seest thou not what they do in the cities of Juda, and in the streets of Jerusalem?
024	JER	007	018	Their children gather wood, and their fathers kindle a fire, and their women knead dough, to make cakes to the host of heaven; and they have poured out drink-offerings to strange gods, that they might provoke me to anger.
024	JER	007	019	Do they provoke me to anger? saith the Lord: do they not [provoke] themselves, that their faces may be ashamed?
024	JER	007	020	Therefore thus saith the Lord; Behold, my anger and wrath shall be poured out upon this place, and upon the men, and upon the cattle, and upon every tree of their field, and upon the fruits of the land; and it shall burn, and not be quenched.
024	JER	007	021	Thus saith the Lord, Gather your whole-burnt-offerings with your meat-offerings, and eat flesh.
024	JER	007	022	For I spoke not to your fathers, and commanded them not in the day wherein I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, concerning whole-burnt-offerings and sacrifice:
024	JER	007	023	but I commanded them this thing, saying, Hear ye my voice, and I will be to you a God, and ye shall be to me a people: and walk ye in all my ways which I shall command you, that it may be well with you.
024	JER	007	024	But they hearkened not to me, and their ear gave no heed, but they walked in the imaginations of their evil heart, and went backward, and not forward;
024	JER	007	025	from the day that their fathers went forth out of the land of Egypt, even until this day. And I sent to you all my servants, the prophets, by day and early in the morning: yea, I sent [them],
024	JER	007	026	but they hearkened not to me, and their ear gave no heed; and they made their neck harder than their fathers.
024	JER	007	027	Therefore thou shalt speak this word to them;
024	JER	007	028	This is the nation which has not hearkened to the voice of the Lord, nor received correction: truth has failed from their mouth.
024	JER	007	029	Cut off thine hair, and cast it away, and take up a lamentation on thy lips; for the Lord has reprobated and rejected the generation that does these things.
024	JER	007	030	For the children of Juda have wrought evil before me, saith the Lord; they have set their abominations in the house on which my name is called, to defile it.
024	JER	007	031	And they have built the altar of Tapheth, which is in the valley of the son of Ennom, to burn their sons and their daughters with fire; which I did not command them [to do], neither did I design it in my heart.
024	JER	007	032	Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when they shall no more say, The altar of Tapheth, and the valley of the son of Ennom, but, The valley of the slain; and they shall bury in Tapheth, for want of room.
024	JER	007	033	And the dead bodies of this people shall be for food to the birds of the sky, and to the wild beasts of the earth; and there shall be none to drive [them] away.
024	JER	007	034	And I will destroy out of the cities of Juda, and the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of them that make merry, and the voice of them that rejoice, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride; for the whole land shall become a desolation.
024	JER	008	001	At that time, saith the Lord, they shall bring out the bones of the kings of Juda, and the bones of his princes, and the bones of the priests, and the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, out of their graves;
024	JER	008	002	and they shall spread them out to the sun, and the moon, and to all the stars, and to all the host of heaven, which they have loved, and which they have served, and after which they have walked, and to which they have held, and which they have worshipped; they shall not be mourned for, neither shall they be buried; but they shall be for an example on the face of the earth,
024	JER	008	003	because they chose death rather than life, even to all the remnant that are left of that family, in every place whither I shall drive them out.
024	JER	008	004	For thus saith the Lord, Shall not he that falls arise? or he that turns away, shall he not turn back again?
024	JER	008	005	Wherefore has this my people turned away with a shameless revolting, and strengthened themselves in their willfulness, and refused to return?
024	JER	008	006	Hearken, I pray you, and hear: will they not speak thus, There is no man that repents of his wickedness, saying, What have I done? the runner has failed from his course, as a tired horse in his neighing.
024	JER	008	007	Yea, the stork in the heaven knows her time, [also] the turtle-dove and wild swallow; the sparrows observe the times of their coming in; but this my people knows not the judgments of the Lord.
024	JER	008	008	How will ye say, We are wise, and the law of the Lord is with us? In vain have the scribes used a false pen.
024	JER	008	009	The wise men are ashamed, and alarmed, and taken; because they have rejected the word of the Lord; what wisdom is there in them?
024	JER	008	010	Therefore will I give their wives to others, and their fields to [new] inheritors; and they shall gather their fruits, saith the Lord.
024	JER	008	013	There are no grapes on the vines, and there are no figs on the fig-trees, and the leaves have fallen off.
024	JER	008	014	Why do we sit still? assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the strong cities, and let us be cast out there: for God has cast us out, and made us drink water of gall, because we have sinned before him.
024	JER	008	015	We assembled for peace, but there was no prosperity; for a time of healing, but behold anxiety.
024	JER	008	016	We shall hear the neighing of his swift horses out of Dan: the whole land quaked at the sound of the neighing of his horses; and he shall come, and devour the land and the fullness of it; the city, and them that dwell in it.
024	JER	008	017	For, behold, I send forth against you deadly serpents, which cannot be charmed, and they shall bite you
024	JER	008	018	mortally with the pain of your distressed heart.
024	JER	008	019	Behold, [there is] a sound of the cry of the daughter of my people from a land afar off: Is not the Lord in Sion? is there not a king there? because they have provoked me with their graven [images], and with strange vanities.
024	JER	008	020	The summer is gone, the harvest is past, and we are not saved.
024	JER	008	021	For the breach of the daughter of my people I have been saddened: in my perplexity pangs have seized upon me as of a woman in travail.
024	JER	008	022	And is there no balm in Galaad, or is there no physician there? why has not the healing of the daughter of my people taken place?
024	JER	009	001	Who will give water to my head, and a fountain of tears to my eyes? then would I weep for this my people day and night, [even] for the slain of the daughter of my people.
024	JER	009	002	Who would give me a most distant lodge in the wilderness, that I might leave my people, and depart from them? for they all commit adultery, an assembly of treacherous men.
024	JER	009	003	And they have bent their tongue like a bow: falsehood and not faithfulness has prevailed upon the earth; for they have gone on from evil to evil, and have not known me, saith the Lord.
024	JER	009	004	Beware ye each of his neighbour, and trust ye not in your brethren: for every one will surely supplant, and every friend will walk craftily.
024	JER	009	005	Every one will mock his friend; they will not speak truth: their tongue has learned to speak falsehoods; they have committed iniquity, they ceased not, so as to return.
024	JER	009	006	[There is] usury upon usury, and deceit upon deceit: they would not know me, saith the Lord.
024	JER	009	007	Therefore thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will try them with fire, and prove them; for I will do [thus] because of the wickedness of the daughter of my people.
024	JER	009	008	Their tongue is a wounding arrow; the words of their mouth are deceitful: [one] speaks peaceably to his neighbour, but in himself retains enmity.
024	JER	009	009	Shall I not visit for these things? saith the Lord: and shall not my soul be avenged on such a people as this?
024	JER	009	010	Take up a lamentation for the mountains, and a mournful dirge for the paths of the wilderness, for they are desolate for want of men; they heard not the sound of life from the birds of the sky, nor the cattle: they were amazed, they are gone.
024	JER	009	011	And I will remove the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and make it a dwelling-place of dragons; and I will utterly waste the cities of Juda, so that they shall not be inhabited.
024	JER	009	012	Who is the wise man, that he may understand this? and he that has the word of the mouth of the Lord [addressed] to him, let him tell you wherefore the land has been destroyed, has been ravaged by fire like a desert, so that no one passes through it.
024	JER	009	013	And the Lord said to me, Because they have forsaken my law, which I set before them, and have not hearkened to my voice;
024	JER	009	014	but went after the lusts of their evil heart, and after the idols which their fathers taught them [to worship]:
024	JER	009	015	therefore thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Behold, I will feed them with trouble and will cause them to drink water of gall:
024	JER	009	016	and I will scatter them among the nations, to them whom neither they nor their fathers knew; and I will send a sword upon them, until I have consumed them with it.
024	JER	009	017	Thus saith the Lord, Call ye the mourning women, and let them come; and send to the wise women, and let them utter their voice;
024	JER	009	018	and let them take up a lamentation for you, and let your eyes pour down tears, and your eyelids drop water.
024	JER	009	019	For a voice of lamentation has been heard in Sion, How are we become wretched! we are greatly ashamed, for we have forsaken the land, and have abandoned our tabernacles!
024	JER	009	020	Hear now, ye women, the word of God, and let your ears receive the words of his mouth, and teach your daughters lamentation, and [every] woman her neighbour a dirge.
024	JER	009	021	For death has come up through your windows, it has entered into our land, to destroy the infants without, and the young men from the streets.
024	JER	009	022	And the carcases of the men shall be for an example on the face of the field of your land, like grass after the mower, and there shall be none to gather [them].
024	JER	009	023	Thus saith the Lord, Let not the wise man boast in his wisdom, and let not the strong man boast in his strength, and let not the rich man boast in his wealth;
024	JER	009	024	but let him that boasts boast in this, the understanding and knowing that I am the Lord that exercise mercy, and judgment, and righteousness, upon the earth; for in these things is my pleasure, saith the Lord.
024	JER	009	025	Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will visit upon all the circumcised their uncircumcision;
024	JER	009	026	on Egypt, and on Idumea, and on Edom, and on the children of Ammon, and on the children of Moab, and on every one that shaves his face round about, [even] them that dwell in the wilderness; for all the Gentiles are uncircumcised in flesh, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised [in] their hearts.
024	JER	010	001	Hear ye the word of the Lord, which he has spoken to you, O house of Israel.
024	JER	010	002	Thus saith the Lord, Learn ye not the ways of the heathen, and be not alarmed at the signs of the sky; for they are alarmed at them, [falling] on their faces.
024	JER	010	003	For the customs of the nations are vain; it is a tree cut out of the forest, the work of the carpenter, or a molten image.
024	JER	010	004	[They are] beautified with silver and gold, they fix them with hammers and nails;
024	JER	010	005	they will set them up that they may not move; it is wrought silver, they will not walk, it is forged silver They must certainly be borne, for they cannot ride [of themselves]. Fear them not; for they cannot do any evil, and there is no good in them.
024	JER	010	011	Thus shall ye say to them, Let the gods which have not made heaven and earth perish from off the earth, and from under this sky.
024	JER	010	012	It is the Lord that made the earth by his strength, who set up the world by his wisdom, and by his understanding stretched out the sky,
024	JER	010	013	and set abundance of waters in the sky, and brought up clouds from the ends of the earth; he made lightnings for the rain, and brought forth light out of his treasures.
024	JER	010	014	Every man is deprived of knowledge, every goldsmith is confounded because of his graven images; for he has cast false gods, there is no breath in them.
024	JER	010	015	They are vain works, wrought in mockery; in the time of their visitation they shall perish.
024	JER	010	016	Such is not the portion of Jacob; for he that formed all things, he is his inheritance; the Lord is his name.
024	JER	010	017	He has gathered thy substance from without the lodged in choice [vessels].
024	JER	010	018	For thus saith the Lord, Behold, I [will] overthrow the inhabitants of this land with affliction, that thy plague may be discovered.
024	JER	010	019	Alas for thy ruin! thy plague is grievous: and I said, Surely this is thy wound, and it has overtaken thee.
024	JER	010	020	Thy tabernacle is in a ruinous state, it has perished; and all thy curtains have been torn asunder: my children and my cattle are no more: there is no more any place for my tabernacle, [nor] place for my curtains.
024	JER	010	021	For the shepherds have become foolish, and have not sought the Lord; therefore the whole pasture has failed, and [the sheep] have been scattered.
024	JER	010	022	Behold, there comes a sound of a noise, and a great earthquake from the land of the north, to make the cities of Juda a desolation, and a resting-place for ostriches.
024	JER	010	023	I know, O Lord, that man's way is not his own; neither shall a man go, and direct his going.
024	JER	010	024	Chasten us, O Lord, but with judgment; and not in wrath, lest thou make us few.
024	JER	010	025	Pour out thy wrath upon the nations that have not known thee, and upon the families that have not called upon thy name: for they have devoured Jacob, and consumed him, and have made his pasture desolate.
024	JER	011	001	The word that came to Jeremias from the Lord, saying,
024	JER	011	002	Hear ye the words of this covenant, and thou shalt speak to the men of Juda, and to the dwellers in Jerusalem;
024	JER	011	003	and thou shalt say to them, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Cursed is the man, who shall not hearken to the words of this covenant,
024	JER	011	004	which I commanded your fathers, in the day wherein I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, out of the iron furnace, saying, Hearken to my voice, and do all things that I shall command you; so shall ye be to me a people, and I will be to you a God;
024	JER	011	005	that I may confirm mine oath, which I sware to your fathers, to give them a land flowing [with] milk and honey, as [it is] this day. Then I answered and said, So be it, O Lord.
024	JER	011	006	And the Lord said to me, Read these words in the cities of Juda, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, Hear ye the words of this covenant, and do them.
024	JER	011	008	But they did [them] not.
024	JER	011	009	And the Lord said to me, A conspiracy is found among the men of Juda, and among the dwellers in Jerusalem.
024	JER	011	010	They are turned [aside] to the iniquities of their fathers that were of old, who would not hearken to my words: and, behold, they go after strange gods, to serve them: and the house of Israel and the house of Juda have broken my covenant, which I made with their fathers.
024	JER	011	011	Therefore thus saith the Lord, Behold, I bring evils upon this people, out of which they shall not be able to come forth; and they shall presently cry to me, but I will not hearken to them.
024	JER	011	012	And the cities of Juda and the dwellers in Jerusalem shall go, and cry to the gods to whom they burn incense; which shall not deliver them in the time of their troubles.
024	JER	011	013	For according to the number of thy cities were thy gods, O Juda; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have ye set up altars to burn incense to Baal.
024	JER	011	014	And thou, pray not for this people, and intercede not for them in supplication and prayer: for I will not hear in the day in which they call upon me, in the day of their affliction.
024	JER	011	015	Why has [my] beloved wrought abomination in my house? will prayers and holy offerings take away thy wickedness from thee, or shalt thou escape by these things?
024	JER	011	016	The Lord called thy name a fair olive tree, of a goodly shade in appearance, at the noise of its being lopped, fire was kindled against it; great is the affliction [coming] upon thee: her branches are become good for nothing.
024	JER	011	017	And the Lord that planted thee has pronounced evils against thee, because of the iniquity of the house of Israel and the house of Juda, whatsoever they have done against themselves to provoke me to anger by burning incense to Baal.
024	JER	011	018	O Lord, teach me, and I shall know: then I saw their practices.
024	JER	011	019	But I as an innocent lamb led to the slaughter, knew not: against me they devised an evil device, saying, Come and let us put wood into his bread, and let us utterly destroy him from off the land of the living, and let his name not be remembered any more.
024	JER	011	020	O Lord, that judgest righteously, trying the reins and hearts, let me see thy vengeance [taken] upon them, for to thee I have declared my cause.
024	JER	011	021	Therefore thus saith the Lord concerning the men of Anathoth, that seek my life, that say, Thou shalt not prophesy at all in the name of the Lord, but if thou dost, thou shalt die by our hands:
024	JER	011	022	behold, I will visit them: their young men shall die by the sword; and their sons and their daughters shall die of famine:
024	JER	011	023	and there shall be no remnant [left] of them; for I will bring evil upon the dwellers in Anathoth, in the year of their visitation.
024	JER	012	001	Righteous art thou, O Lord, that I may make my defence to thee, yea, I will speak to thee [of] judgments. Why [is it] that the way of ungodly [men] prospers? [that] all that deal very treacherously are flourishing?
024	JER	012	002	Thou hast planted them, and they have taken root; they have begotten children, and become fruitful; thou art near to their mouth, and far from their reins.
024	JER	012	003	But thou, Lord, knowest me; thou hast proved my heart before thee; purify them for the day of their slaughter.
024	JER	012	004	How long shall the land mourn, and the grass of the field wither, for the wickedness of them, that dwell in it? the beasts and birds are utterly destroyed; because [the people] said, God shall not see our ways.
024	JER	012	005	Thy feet run, and they cause thee to faint; how wilt thou prepare [to ride] upon horses? and thou hast been confident in the land of thy peace? how wilt thou do in the roaring of Jordan?
024	JER	012	006	For even thy brethren and the house of thy father, even these have dealt treacherously with thee; and they have cried out, they are gathered together in pursuit of thee; trust not thou in them, though they shall speak fair [words] to thee.
024	JER	012	007	I have forsaken mine house, I have left mine heritage; I have given my beloved one into the hands of her enemies.
024	JER	012	008	My inheritance has become to me as a lion in a forest; she has uttered her voice against me; therefore have I hated her.
024	JER	012	009	Is not my inheritance to me a hyaena's cave, or a cave round about her? Go ye, gather together all the wild beasts of the field, and let them come to devour her.
024	JER	012	010	Many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard, they have defiled my portion, they have made my desirable portion a trackless wilderness;
024	JER	012	011	it is made a complete ruin: for my sake the whole land has been utterly ruined, because there is none that lays [the matter] to heart.
024	JER	012	012	The ravagers are come to every passage in the wilderness: for the sword of the Lord will devour from one end of the land to the other: no flesh has any peace.
024	JER	012	013	Sow wheat, and reap thorns; their portions shall not profit them: be ashamed of your boasting, because of reproach before the Lord.
024	JER	012	014	For thus saith the Lord, concerning all the evil neighbours that touch mine inheritance, which I have divided to my people Israel; Behold, I [will] draw them away from their land, and I will cast out Juda from the midst of them.
024	JER	012	015	And it shall come to pass, after I have cast them out, [that] I will return, and have mercy upon them, and will cause them to dwell every one in his inheritance, and every one in his land.
024	JER	012	016	And it shall be, if they will indeed learn the way of my people, to swear by my name, [saying], The Lord lives; as they taught my people to swear by Baal; then shall [that nation] be built in the midst of my people.
024	JER	012	017	But if they will not return, then will I cut off that nation with utter ruin and destruction.
024	JER	013	001	Thus saith the Lord, Go and procure for thyself a linen girdle, and put it about thy loins, and let it not be put in water.
024	JER	013	002	So I procured the girdle according to the word of the Lord, and put it about my loins.
024	JER	013	003	And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
024	JER	013	004	Take the girdle that is upon thy loins, and arise, and go to the Euphrates, and hide it there in a hole of the rock.
024	JER	013	005	So I went, and hid it by the Euphrates, as the Lord commanded me.
024	JER	013	006	And it came to pass after many days, that the Lord said to me, Arise, go to the Euphrates, and take thence the girdle, which I commanded thee to hide there.
024	JER	013	007	So I went to the river Euphrates, and dug, and took the girdle out of the place where I [had] buried it: and, behold, it was rotten, utterly good for nothing.
024	JER	013	008	And the word of the Lord came to me, saying, Thus saith the Lord,
024	JER	013	009	Thus will I mar the pride of Juda, and the pride of Jerusalem;
024	JER	013	010	[even] this great pride [of the men] that will not hearken to my words, and have gone after strange gods, to serve them, and to worship them: and they shall be as this girdle, which can be used for nothing.
024	JER	013	011	For as a girdle cleaves about the loins of a man, so have I caused to cleave to myself the house of Israel, and the whole house of Juda; that they might be to me a famous people, and a praise, and a glory: but they did not hearken to me.
024	JER	013	012	And thou shalt say to this people, Every bottle shall be filled with wine: and it shall come to pass, if they shall say to thee, Shall we not certainly know that every bottle shall be filled with wine? that thou shalt say to them,
024	JER	013	013	Thus saith the Lord, Behold, I [will] fill the inhabitants of this land, and their kings the sons of David that sit upon their throne, and the priests, and the prophets, and Juda and all the dwellers in Jerusalem, with strong drink.
024	JER	013	014	And I will scatter them a man and his brother, and their fathers and their sons together: I will not have compassion, saith the Lord, and I will not spare, neither will I pity [to save them] from destruction.
024	JER	013	015	Hear ye, and give ear, and be not proud: for the Lord has spoken.
024	JER	013	016	Give glory to the Lord your God, before he cause darkness, and before your feet stumble on the dark mountains, and ye shall wait for light, and behold the shadow of death, and they shall be brought into darkness.
024	JER	013	017	But if ye will not hearken, your soul shall weep in secret because of pride, and your eyes shall pour down tears, because the Lord's flock is sorely bruised.
024	JER	013	018	Say ye to the king and the princes, Humble yourselves, and sit down; for your crown of glory is removed from your head.
024	JER	013	019	The cities toward the south were shut, and there was none to open [them]: Juda is removed [into captivity,]they have suffered a complete removal.
024	JER	013	020	Lift up thine eyes, O Jerusalem, and behold them that come from the north; where is the flock that was given thee, the sheep of thy glory?
024	JER	013	021	What wilt thou say when they shall visit thee, for thou didst teach them lessons for rule against thyself; shall not pangs seize thee as a woman in travail?
024	JER	013	022	And if thou shouldest say in thine heart, Wherefore have these things happened to me? Because of the abundance of thine iniquity have thy skirts been discovered, that thine heels might be exposed.
024	JER	013	023	If the Ethiopian shall change his skin, or the leopardess her spots, then shall ye be able to do good, having learnt evil.
024	JER	013	024	So I scattered them as sticks carried by the wind into the wilderness.
024	JER	013	025	Thus is thy lot, and the reward of your disobedience to me, saith the Lord; as thou didst forget me, and trust in lies,
024	JER	013	026	I also will expose thy skirts upon thy face, and thy shame shall be seen;
024	JER	013	027	thine adultery also, and thy neighing, and the looseness of thy fornication: on the hills and in the fields I have seen thine abominations. Woe to thee, O Jerusalem, for thou hast not been purified so as to follow me; how long yet [shall it be]?
024	JER	014	001	AND THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO JEREMIAS CONCERNING THE DROUGHT.
024	JER	014	002	Judea has mourned, and her gates are emptied, and are darkened upon the earth; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up.
024	JER	014	003	And her nobles have sent their little ones to the water: they came to the wells, and found no water: and brought back their vessels empty.
024	JER	014	004	And the labours of the land failed, because there was no rain: the husbandmen were ashamed, they covered their heads.
024	JER	014	005	And hinds calved in the field, and forsook [it], because there was no grass.
024	JER	014	006	The wild asses stood by the forests, and snuffed up the wind; their eyes failed, because there was no grass.
024	JER	014	007	Our sins have risen up against us: O Lord, do thou for us for thine own sake; for our sins are many before thee; for we have sinned against thee.
024	JER	014	008	O Lord, [thou art] the hope of Israel, and deliverest [us] in time of troubles; why art thou become as a sojourner upon the land, or as one born in the land, yet turning aside for a resting-place?
024	JER	014	009	Wilt thou be as a man asleep, or as a [strong] man that cannot save? yet thou art among us, O Lord, and thy name is called upon us; forget us not.
024	JER	014	010	Thus saith the Lord to this people, They have loved to wander, and they have not spared, therefore God has not prospered them; now will he remember their iniquity.
024	JER	014	011	And the Lord said to me, Pray not for this people for [their] good:
024	JER	014	012	for though they fast, I will not hear their supplication; and though they offer whole-burnt-offerings and sacrifices, I will take no pleasure in them: for I will consume them with sword, and with famine, and with pestilence.
024	JER	014	013	And I said, O [ever] living Lord! behold, their prophets prophesy, and say, Ye shall not see a sword, nor shall famine be among you; for I will give truth and peace on the land, and in this place.
024	JER	014	014	Then the Lord said to me, The prophets prophesy lies in my name: I sent them not, and I commanded them not, and I spoke not to them: for they prophesy to you false visions, and divinations, and auguries, and devices of their own heart.
024	JER	014	015	Therefore thus saith the Lord concerning the prophets that prophesy lies in my name, and I sent them not, who say, Sword and famine shall not be upon this land; they shall die by a grievous death, and the prophets shall be consumed by famine.
024	JER	014	016	And the people to whom they prophesy, they also shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem, because of the sword and famine; and there shall be none to bury them: their wives also, and their sons, and their daughters [shall die thus]; and I will pour out their wickedness upon them.
024	JER	014	017	And thou shalt speak this word to them; Let your eyes shed tears day and night, and let them not cease: for the daughter of my people has been sorely bruised, and her plague is very grievous.
024	JER	014	018	If I go forth into the plain, then behold the slain by the sword! and if I enter into the city, then behold the distress of famine! for priest and prophet have gone to a land which they knew not.
024	JER	014	019	Hast thou utterly rejected Juda? and has thy soul departed from Sion? wherefore has thou smitten us, and there is no healing for us? we waited for peace, but there was no prosperity; for a time of healing, and behold trouble!
024	JER	014	020	We know, O Lord, our sins, [and] the iniquities of our fathers: for we have sinned before thee.
024	JER	014	021	Refrain for thy name's sake, destroy not the throne of thy glory: remember, break not thy covenant with us.
024	JER	014	022	Is there any one among the idols of the Gentiles that can give rain? and will the sky yield his fulness [at their bidding]? Art not thou he? we will even wait on thee, O Lord: for thou hast made all these things.
024	JER	015	001	And the Lord said to me, Though Moses and Samuel stood before my face, my soul could not be toward them: dismiss this people, and let them go forth.
024	JER	015	002	And it shall be, if they say to thee, Whither shall we go forth? then thou shalt say to them, Thus saith the Lord; As many as are for death, to death; and as many as are for famine, to famine; and as many as are for the sword, to the sword; and as many as are for captivity, to captivity.
024	JER	015	003	And I will punish them with four kinds [of death], saith the Lord, the sword to slay, and the dogs to tear, and the wild beasts of the earth, and the birds of the sky to devour and destroy.
024	JER	015	004	And I will deliver them up for distress to all the kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasses son of Ezekias king of Juda, for all that he did in Jerusalem.
024	JER	015	005	Who will spare thee, O Jerusalem? and who will fear for thee? or who will turn back [to ask] for thy welfare?
024	JER	015	006	Thou hast turned away from me, saith the Lord, thou wilt go back: therefore I will stretch out my hand, and will destroy thee, and will no more spare them.
024	JER	015	007	And I will completely scatter them; in the gates of my people they are bereaved of children: they have destroyed my people because of their iniquities.
024	JER	015	008	Their widows have been multiplied more than the sand of the sea: I have brought young men against the mother, [even] distress at noon-day: I have suddenly cast upon her trembling and anxiety.
024	JER	015	009	She that bore seven is spent; her soul has fainted under trouble; her sun is gone down while it is yet noon; she is ashamed and disgraced: I will give the remnant of them to the sword before their enemies.
024	JER	015	010	Woe is me, [my] mother! thou hast born me as some man of strife, and at variance with the whole earth; I have not helped [others], nor has any one helped me; my strength has failed among them that curse me.
024	JER	015	011	Be it so, Lord, in their prosperity; surely I stood before thee in the time of their calamities, and in the time of their affliction, for [their] good against the enemy.
024	JER	015	012	Will iron be known? whereas thy strength is a brazen covering.
024	JER	015	013	Yea, I will give thy treasures for a spoil as a recompence, because of all thy sins and [that] in all thy borders.
024	JER	015	014	And I will enslave thee to thine enemies round about, in a land which thou hast not known; for a fire has been kindled out of my wrath; it shall burn upon you.
024	JER	015	015	O Lord, remember me, and visit me, and vindicate me before them that persecute me; do not bear long with them; know how I have met with reproach for thy sake, from those who set at nought thy words;
024	JER	015	016	consume them; and thy word shall be to me for the joy and gladness of my heart: for thy name has been called upon me, O Lord Almighty.
024	JER	015	017	I have not sat in the assembly of them as they mocked, but I feared because of thy power: I sat alone, for I was filled with bitterness.
024	JER	015	018	Why do they that grieve me prevail against me? my wound is severe; whence shall I be healed? it is indeed become to me as deceitful water, that has no faithfulness.
024	JER	015	019	Therefore thus saith the Lord, If thou wilt return, then will I restore thee, and thou shalt stand before my face: and if thou wilt bring forth the precious from the worthless, thou shalt be as my mouth: and they shall return to thee; but thou shalt not return to them.
024	JER	015	020	And I will make thee to this people as a strong brazen wall; and they shall fight against thee, but they shall by no means prevail against thee;
024	JER	015	021	for I am with thee to save thee, and to deliver thee out of the hand of wicked [men]; and I will ransom thee out of the hand of pestilent [men].
024	JER	016	001	And thou shalt not take a wife, saith the Lord God of Israel:
024	JER	016	002	and there shall be no son born to thee, nor daughter in this place.
024	JER	016	003	For thus saith the Lord concerning the sons and concerning the daughters that are born in this place, and concerning their mothers that have born them, and concerning their fathers that have begotten them in this land;
024	JER	016	004	They shall die of grievous death; they shall not be lamented, nor buried; they shall be for an example on the face of the earth; and they shall be for the wild beasts of the land, and for the birds of the sky: they shall fall by the sword, and shall be consumed with famine.
024	JER	016	005	Thus saith the Lord, Enter not into their mourning feast, and go not to lament, and mourn not for them: for I have removed my peace from this people.
024	JER	016	006	They shall not bewail them, nor make cuttings for them, and they shall not shave themselves [for them]:
024	JER	016	007	and there shall be no bread broken in mourning for them for consolation over the dead: they shall not give one to drink a cup for consolation over his father or his mother.
024	JER	016	008	Thou shalt not enter into the banquet-house, to sit with them to eat and to drink.
024	JER	016	009	For thus saith the Lord God of Israel; Behold, I [will] make to cease out of this place before your eyes, and in your days, the voice of joy, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride.
024	JER	016	010	And it shall come to pass, when thou shalt report to this people all these words, and they shall say to thee, Wherefore has the Lord pronounced against us all these evils? what is our unrighteousness? and what is our sin which we have sinned before the Lord our God?
024	JER	016	011	Then thou shalt say to them, Because your fathers forsook me, saith the Lord, and went after strange gods and served them, and worshipped them, and forsook me, and kept not my law;
024	JER	016	012	(and ye sinned worse than your fathers; for, behold, ye walk every one after the lusts of your own evil heart, so as not to hearken to me);
024	JER	016	013	therefore I will cast you off from this good land into a land which neither ye nor your fathers have known; and ye shall serve their other gods, who shall have no mercy upon you.
024	JER	016	014	Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when they shall no more say, The Lord lives, that brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;
024	JER	016	015	but, The Lord lives, who brought up the house of Israel from the land of the north, and from all countries whither they were thrust out: and I will restore them to their own land, which I gave to their fathers.
024	JER	016	016	Behold, I [will] send many fishers, saith the Lord, and they shall fish them; and afterward I will send many hunters, and they shall hunt them upon every mountain, and upon every hill, and out of the holes of the rocks.
024	JER	016	017	For mine eyes are upon all their ways; and their iniquities have not been hidden from mine eyes.
024	JER	016	018	And I will recompense their mischiefs doubly, and their sins, whereby they have profaned my land with the carcases of their abominations, and with their iniquities, whereby they have trespassed against mine inheritance.
024	JER	016	019	O Lord, thou art my strength, and mine help, and my refuge in days of evil: to thee the Gentiles shall come from the end of the earth, and shall say, How vain [were the] idols [which] our fathers procured to themselves, and there is no help in them.
024	JER	016	020	Will a man make gods for himself, whereas these are no gods?
024	JER	016	021	Therefore, behold, I will at this time manifest my hand to them, and will make known to them my power; and they shall know that my name is the Lord.
024	JER	017	001	Cursed is the man who trusts in man, and will lean his arm of flesh upon him, while his heart departs from the Lord.
024	JER	017	006	And he shall be as the wild tamarisk in the desert: he shall not see when good comes; but he shall dwell in barren [places], and in the wilderness, in a salt land which is not inhabited.
024	JER	017	007	But blessed is the man who trusts in the Lord, and whose hope the Lord shall be.
024	JER	017	008	And he shall be as a thriving tree by the waters, and he shall cast forth his root toward a moist place: he shall not fear when heat comes, and there shall be upon him shady branches: he shall not fear in a year of drought, and he shall not fail to bear fruit.
024	JER	017	009	The heart is deep beyond all things, and it is the man, and who can know him?
024	JER	017	010	I the Lord try the hearts, and prove the reins, to give to every one according to his ways, and according to the fruits of his devices.
024	JER	017	011	The partridge utters her voice, she gathers [eggs] which she did not lay; [so is a man] gaining his wealth unjustly; in the midst of his days [his riches] shall leave him, and at his latter end he will be a fool.
024	JER	017	012	An exalted throne of glory is our sanctuary.
024	JER	017	013	O Lord, the hope of Israel, let all that have left thee be ashamed, let them that have revolted be written on the earth, because they have forsaken the fountain of life, the Lord.
024	JER	017	014	Heal me, O Lord, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall be saved; for thou art my boast.
024	JER	017	015	Behold, they say to me, Where is the word of the Lord? let it come.
024	JER	017	016	But I have not been weary of following thee, nor have I desired the day of man; thou knowest; the [words] that proceed out of my lips are before thy face.
024	JER	017	017	Be not to me a stranger, [but] spare me in the evil day.
024	JER	017	018	Let them that persecute me be ashamed, but let me not be ashamed: let them be alarmed, but let me not be alarmed: bring upon them the evil day, crush them with double destruction.
024	JER	017	019	Thus saith the Lord; Go and stand in the gates of the children of thy people, by which the kings of Juda enter, and by which they go out, and in all the gates of Jerusalem:
024	JER	017	020	and thou shalt say to them, Hear the word of the Lord, ye kings of Juda, and all Judea, and all Jerusalem, [all] who go in at these gates:
024	JER	017	021	thus saith the Lord; Take heed to your souls, and take up no burdens on the sabbath-day, and go not forth [through] the gates of Jerusalem;
024	JER	017	022	and carry forth no burdens out of your houses on the sabbath-day, and ye shall do no work: sanctify the sabbath-day, as I commanded your fathers.
024	JER	017	023	But they hearkened not, and inclined not their ear, but stiffened their neck more than their fathers [did], so as not to hear me, and not to receive correction.
024	JER	017	024	And it shall come to pass, if ye will hearken to me, saith the Lord, to carry in no burdens through the gates of this city on the sabbath-day, and to sanctify the sabbath-day, so as to do no work [upon it],
024	JER	017	025	that there shall enter through the gates of this city kings and princes sitting on the throne of David, and riding on their chariots and horses, they, and their princes, the men of Juda, and the dwellers in Jerusalem: and this city shall be inhabited for ever.
024	JER	017	026	And [men] shall come out of the cities of Juda, and from round about Jerusalem, and out of the land of Benjamin, and out of the plain country, and from the hill country, and from the south [country], bringing whole-burnt-offerings, and sacrifices, and incense, and manna, and frankincense, bringing praise to the house of the Lord.
024	JER	017	027	But it shall come to pass, if ye will not hearken to me to sanctify the sabbath-day, to bear no burdens, nor go in [with them by] the gates of Jerusalem on the sabbath-day; then will I kindle a fire in the gates thereof, and it shall devour the streets of Jerusalem, and shall not be quenched.
024	JER	018	001	The word that came from the Lord to
024	JER	018	002	Jeremias, saying, Arise, and go down to the potter's house, and there thou shalt hear my words.
024	JER	018	003	So I went down to the potter's house, and behold, he was making a vessel on the stones.
024	JER	018	004	And the vessel which he was making with his hands fell: so he made it again another vessel, as it seemed good to him to make [it].
024	JER	018	005	And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
024	JER	018	006	Shall I not be able, O house of Israel, to do to you as this potter? behold, as the clay of the potter are ye in my hands.
024	JER	018	007	[If] I shall pronounce a decree upon a nation, or upon a kingdom, to cut them off, and to destroy [them];
024	JER	018	008	and that nation turn from all their sins, then will I repent of the evils which I purposed to do to them.
024	JER	018	009	And [if] I shall pronounce a decree upon a nation and kingdom, to rebuild and to plant [it];
024	JER	018	010	and they do evil before me, so as not to hearken to my voice, then will I repent of the good which I spoke of, to do it to them.
024	JER	018	011	And now say to the men of Juda, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Behold, I prepare evils against you, and devise a device against you: let every one turn now from his evil way, and amend your practices.
024	JER	018	012	And they said, We will quit ourselves like men, for we will pursue our perverse ways, and we will perform each the lusts of his evil heart.
024	JER	018	013	Therefore thus saith the Lord; Enquire now among the nations, who has heard such very horrible things as the virgin of Israel has done?
024	JER	018	014	Will fertilising streams fail [to flow] from a rock, or snow [fail] from Libanus? will water violently impelled by the wind turn aside?
024	JER	018	015	For my people have forgotten me, they have offered incense in vain, and they fail in their ways, [leaving] the ancient tracks, to enter upon impassable paths;
024	JER	018	016	to make their land a desolation, and a perpetual hissing; all that go through it shall be amazed, and shall shake their heads.
024	JER	018	017	I will scatter them before their enemies like an east wind; I will shew them the day of their destruction.
024	JER	018	018	Then they said, Come, and let us devise a device against Jeremias; for the law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come, and let us smite him with the tongue, and we will hear all his words.
024	JER	018	019	Hear me, O Lord, and hear the voice of my pleading.
024	JER	018	020	Forasmuch as evil is rewarded for good; for they have spoken words against my soul, and they have hidden the punishment they [meant] for me; remember that I stood before thy face, to speak good for them, to turn away thy wrath from them.
024	JER	018	021	Therefore do thou deliver their sons to famine, and gather them to the power of the sword: let their women be childless and widows; and let their men be cut off by death, and their young men fall by the sword in war.
024	JER	018	022	Let there be a cry in their houses: thou shalt bring upon them robbers suddenly: for they have formed a plan to take me, and have hidden snares for me.
024	JER	018	023	And thou, Lord, knowest all their deadly counsel against me: account not their iniquities guiltless, and blot not out their sins from before thee: let their weakness come before thee; deal with them in the time of thy wrath.
024	JER	019	001	Then said the Lord to me, Go and get an earthen bottle, the work of the potter, and thou shalt bring [some] of the elders of the people, and of the priests;
024	JER	019	002	and thou shalt go forth to the burial-place of the sons of their children, which is at the entrance of the gate of Charsith; and do thou read there all these words which I shall speak to thee:
024	JER	019	003	and thou shalt say to them, Hear ye the word of the Lord, ye kings of Juda, and men of Juda, and the dwellers in Jerusalem, and they that enter in by these gates; thus saith the Lord God of Israel; Behold, I [will] bring evil upon this place, so that the ears of every one that hears it shall tingle.
024	JER	019	004	Because they forsook me, and profaned this place, and burnt incense in it to strange gods, which they and their fathers knew not; and the kings of Juda have filled this place with innocent blood,
024	JER	019	005	and built high places for Baal, to burn their children in the fire, which things I commanded not, neither did I design [them] in my heart:
024	JER	019	006	Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when this place shall no more be called, The fall and burial-place of the son of Ennom, but, The burial-place of slaughter.
024	JER	019	007	And I will destroy the counsel of Juda and the counsel of Jerusalem in this place; and I will cast them down with the sword before their enemies, and by the hands of them that seek their lives: and I will give their dead bodies for food to the birds of the sky and to the wild beasts of the earth.
024	JER	019	008	And I will bring this city to desolation and [make it] a hissing; every one that passes by it shall scowl, and hiss because of all her plague.
024	JER	019	009	And they shall eat the flesh of their sons, and the flesh of their daughters; and they shall eat every one the flesh of his neighbour in the blockade, and in the siege wherewith their enemies shall besiege them.
024	JER	019	010	And thou shalt break the bottle in the sight of the men that go forth with thee,
024	JER	019	011	and thou shalt say, Thus saith the Lord, Thus will I break in pieces this people, and this city, even as an earthen vessel is broken in pieces which cannot be mended again.
024	JER	019	012	Thus will I do, saith the Lord, to this place, and to the inhabitants of it, that this city may be given up, as one that is falling to ruin.
024	JER	019	013	And the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses of the kings of Juda shall be as a ruinous place, because of their uncleannesses in all the houses, wherein they burnt incense upon their roofs to all the host of heaven, and poured drink-offerings to strange gods.
024	JER	019	014	And Jeremias came from [the place] of the Fall, whither the Lord had sent him to prophesy; and he stood in the court of the Lord's house: and said to all the people, Thus saith the Lord;
024	JER	019	015	Behold I bring upon this city, and upon all the cities belonging to it, and upon the villages of it, all the evils which I have spoken against it, because they have hardened their neck, [that they might not] hearken to my commands.
024	JER	020	001	Now Paschor the son of Emmer, the priest, who also had been appointed chief of the house of the Lord, heard Jeremias prophesying these words.
024	JER	020	002	And he smote him, and cast him into the dungeon which was by the gate of the upper house that was set apart, which was by the house of the Lord.
024	JER	020	003	And Paschor brought Jeremias out of the dungeon: and Jeremias said to him, [The Lord] has not called thy name Paschor, but Exile.
024	JER	020	004	For thus saith the Lord, Behold, I [will] give thee up to captivity with all thy friends: and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, and thine eyes shall see [it]: and I will give thee and all Juda into the hands of the king of Babylon, and they shall carry them captives, and cut them in pieces with swords.
024	JER	020	005	And I will give all the strength of this city, and all the labours of it, and all the treasures of the king of Juda, into the hands of his enemies, and they shall bring them to Babylon.
024	JER	020	006	And thou and all the dwellers in thine house shall go into captivity: and thou shalt die in Babylon, and there thou and all thy friends shall be buried, to whom thou hast prophesied lies.
024	JER	020	007	Thou hast deceived me, O Lord, and I have been deceived: thou hast been strong, and has prevailed: I am become a laughing-stock, I am continually mocked every day.
024	JER	020	008	For I will laugh with my bitter speech, I will call upon rebellion and misery: for the word of the Lord is become a reproach to me and a mockery all my days.
024	JER	020	009	Then I said, I will by no means name the name of the Lord, and I will no more at all speak in his name. But it was a burning fire flaming in my bones, and I am utterly weakened on all sides, and cannot bear [up].
024	JER	020	010	For I have heard the reproach of many gathering round, [saying], Conspire ye, and let us conspire together against him, [even] all his friends: watch his intentions, if perhaps he shall be deceived, and we shall prevail against him, and we shall be avenged on him.
024	JER	020	011	But the Lord was with me as a mighty man of war: therefore they persecuted [me], but could not perceive [anything against me]; they were greatly confounded, for they perceived not their disgrace, which shall never be forgotten.
024	JER	020	012	O Lord, that provest just [deeds], understanding the reins and hearts, let me see thy vengeance upon them: for to thee I have revealed my cause.
024	JER	020	013	Sing ye to the Lord, sing praise to him: for he has rescued the soul of the poor from the hand of evil-doers.
024	JER	020	014	Cursed be the day wherein I was born: the day wherein my mother brought me forth, let it not be blessed.
024	JER	020	015	Cursed be the man who brought the glad tidings to my father, saying, A male child is born to thee.
024	JER	020	016	Let that man rejoice as the cities which the Lord overthrew in wrath, and repented not: let him hear crying in the morning, and loud lamentation at noon;
024	JER	020	017	because he slew me not in the womb, and my mother became not my tomb, and her womb always great with me.
024	JER	020	018	Why is it that I came forth of the womb to see troubles and distresses, and my days are spent in shame?
024	JER	021	001	THE WORD THAT CAME FROM THE LORD TO JEREMIAS, WHEN KING SEDEKIAS SENT TO HIM PASCHOR THE SON OF MELCHIAS, AND SOPHONIAS SON OF BASAEAS, THE PRIEST, SAYING,
024	JER	021	002	Enquire of the Lord for us; for the king of Babylon has risen up against us; if the Lord will do according to all his wonderful works, and [the king] shall depart from us.
024	JER	021	003	And Jeremias said to them, Thus shall ye say to Sedekias king of Juda,
024	JER	021	004	Thus saith the Lord; Behold, I [will] turn back the weapons of war wherewith ye fight against the Chaldeans that have besieged you from outside the wall, and I will gather them into the midst of this city.
024	JER	021	005	And I will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm, with wrath and great anger.
024	JER	021	006	And I will smite all the dwellers in this city, [both] men and cattle, with grievous pestilence: and they shall die.
024	JER	021	007	And after this, thus saith the Lord; I will give Sedekias king of Juda, and his servants, and the people that is left in this city from the pestilence, and from the famine, and from the sword, into the hands of their enemies, that seek their lives: and they shall cut them in pieces with the edge of the sword: I will not spare them, and I will not have compassion upon them.
024	JER	021	008	And thou shalt say to this people, Thus saith the Lord; Behold, I have set before you the way of life, and the way of death.
024	JER	021	009	He that remains in this city shall die by the sword, and by famine: but he that goes forth to advance to the Chaldeans that have besieged you, shall live, and his life shall be to him for a spoil, and he shall live.
024	JER	021	010	For I have set my face against this city for evil, and not for good: it shall be delivered into the hands of the king of Babylon, and he shall consume it with fire.
024	JER	021	011	O house of the king of Juda, hear ye the word of the Lord.
024	JER	021	012	O house of David, thus saith the Lord; Judge judgment in the morning, and act rightly, and rescue the spoiled one from the hand of him that wrongs him, lest mine anger be kindled like fire, and it burn, and there be none to quench [it].
024	JER	021	013	Behold, I am against thee that dwellest in the valley of Sor; in the plain country, [even against] them that say, Who shall alarm us? or who shall enter into our habitation?
024	JER	021	014	And I will kindle a fire in the forest thereof, and it shall devour all things round about it.
024	JER	022	001	Thus saith the Lord; Go thou, and go down to the house of the king of Juda, and thou shalt speak there this word,
024	JER	022	002	and thou shalt say, Hear the word of the Lord, O king of Juda, that sittest on the throne of David, thou, and thy house, and thy people, and they that go in at these gates:
024	JER	022	003	thus saith the Lord; Execute ye judgment and justice, and rescue the spoiled out of the hand of him that wrongs him: and oppress not the stranger, and orphan, and widow, and sin not, and shed no innocent blood in this place.
024	JER	022	004	For if ye will indeed perform this word, then shall there enter in by the gates of this house kings sitting upon the throne of David, and riding on chariots and horses, they, and their servants, and their people.
024	JER	022	005	But if ye will not perform these words, by myself have I sworn, saith the Lord, that this house shall be [brought] to desolation.
024	JER	022	006	For thus saith the Lord concerning the house of the king of Juda; Thou art Galaad to me, [and] the head of Libanus: [yet] surely I will make thee a desert, [even] cities that shall not be inhabited:
024	JER	022	007	and I will bring upon thee a destroying man, and his axe: and they shall cut down thy choice cedars, and cast [them] into the fire.
024	JER	022	008	And nations shall pass through this city, and each shall say to his neighbour, Why has the Lord done thus to this great city?
024	JER	022	009	And they shall say, Because they forsook the covenant of the Lord their God, and worshipped strange gods, and served them.
024	JER	022	010	Weep not for the dead, nor lament for him: weep bitterly for him that goes away: for he shall return no more, nor see his native land.
024	JER	022	011	For thus saith the Lord concerning Sellem the son of Josias, who reigns in the place of Josias his father, who has gone forth out of this place; He shall not return thither any more:
024	JER	022	012	but in that place whither I have carried him captive, there shall he die, and shall see this land no more.
024	JER	022	013	He that builds his house not with justice, and his upper chambers not with judgment, who works by means of his neighbour for nothing, and will by no means give him his reward.
024	JER	022	014	Thou hast built for thyself a well-proportioned house, airy chambers, fitted with windows, and wainscoted with cedar, and painted with vermilion.
024	JER	022	015	Shalt thou reign, because thou art provoked with thy father Achaz? they shall not eat, and they shall not drink: it is better for thee to execute judgment and justice.
024	JER	022	016	They understood not, they judged not the cause of the afflicted, nor the cause of the poor: is not this thy not knowing me? saith the Lord.
024	JER	022	017	Behold, thine eyes are not good, nor thine heart, but [they go] after thy covetousness, and after the innocent blood to shed it, and after acts of injustice and slaughter, to commit them.
024	JER	022	018	Therefore thus saith the Lord concerning Joakim son of Josias, king of Juda, even concerning this man; they shall not bewail him, [saying], Ah brother! neither shall they at all weep for him, [saying], Alas Lord.
024	JER	022	019	He shall be buried with the burial of an ass; he shall be dragged roughly along and cast outside the gate of Jerusalem.
024	JER	022	020	Go up to Libanus, and cry; and utter thy voice to Basan, and cry aloud to the extremity of the sea: for all thy lovers are destroyed.
024	JER	022	021	I spoke to thee on [occasion of] thy trespass, but thou saidst, I will not hearken. This [has been] thy way from thy youth, thou hast not hearkened to my voice.
024	JER	022	022	The wind shall tend all thy shepherds, and thy lovers shall go into captivity; for then shalt thou be ashamed and disgraced because of all thy lovers.
024	JER	022	023	O thou that dwellest in Libanus, making thy nest in the cedars, thou shalt groan heavily, when pangs as of a travailing woman are come upon thee.
024	JER	022	024	[As] I live, saith the Lord, though Jechonias son of Joakim king of Juda were indeed the seal upon my right hand, thence would I pluck thee;
024	JER	022	025	and I will deliver thee into the hands of them that seek thy life, before whom thou art afraid, into the hands of the Chaldeans.
024	JER	022	026	And I will cast forth thee, and thy mother that bore thee, into a land where thou wast not born; and there ye shall die.
024	JER	022	027	But they shall by no means return to the land which they long for in their souls.
024	JER	022	028	Jechonias is dishonoured as a good-for-nothing vessel; for he is thrown out and cast forth into a land which he knew not.
024	JER	022	029	Land, land, hear the word of the Lord.
024	JER	022	030	Write ye this man an outcast: for there shall none of his seed at all grow up to sit on the throne of David, [or as] a prince yet in Juda.
024	JER	023	001	Woe to the shepherds that destroy and scatter the sheep of their pasture!
024	JER	023	002	Therefore thus saith the Lord against them that tend my people; Ye have scattered my sheep, and driven them out, and ye have not visited them: behold, I [will] take vengeance upon you according to your evil practices.
024	JER	023	003	And I will gather in the remnant of my people in every land, whither I have driven them out, and will set them in their pasture; and they shall increase and be multiplied.
024	JER	023	004	And I will raise up shepherds to them, who shall feed them: and they shall fear no more, nor be alarmed, saith the Lord.
024	JER	023	005	Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will raise up to David a righteous branch, and a king shall reign and understand, and shall execute judgment and righteousness on the earth.
024	JER	023	006	In his days both Juda shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell securely: and this is his name, which the Lord shall call him, Josedec among the prophets.
024	JER	023	007	Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when they shall no more say, The Lord lives, who brought up the house of Israel out of the land of Egypt;
024	JER	023	008	but The Lord lives, who has gathered the whole seed of Israel from the north land, and from all the countries whither he [had] driven them out, and has restored them into their own land.
024	JER	023	009	My heart is broken within me; all my bones are shaken: I am become as a broken-down man, and as a man overcome with wine, because of the Lord, and because of the excellence of his glory.
024	JER	023	010	For because of these things the land mourns; the pastures of the wilderness are dried up; and their course is become evil, and so [also] their strength.
024	JER	023	011	For priest and prophet are defiled; and I have seen their iniquities in my house.
024	JER	023	012	Therefore let their way be to them slippery and dark: and they shall be tripped up and fall in it: for I will bring evils upon them, in the year of their visitation.
024	JER	023	013	And in the prophets of Samaria I have seen lawless deeds; they prophesied by Baal, and led my people Israel astray.
024	JER	023	014	Also in the prophets of Jerusalem I have seen horrible things: as they committed adultery, and walked in lies, and strengthened the hands of many, that they should not return each from his evil way: they are all become to me as Sodom, and the inhabitants thereof as Gomorrha.
024	JER	023	015	Therefore thus saith the Lord; Behold, I will feed them with pain, and give them bitter water to drink: for from the prophets of Jerusalem has defilement gone forth [into] all the land.
024	JER	023	016	Thus saith the Lord Almighty, Hearken not to the words of the prophets: for they frame a vain vision for themselves; they speak from their own heart, and not from the mouth of the Lord.
024	JER	023	017	They say to them that reject the word of the Lord, There shall be peace to you; and to all that walk after their own lusts, and to everyone that walks in the error of his heart, they have said, No evil shall come upon thee.
024	JER	023	018	For who has stood in the counsel of the Lord, and seen his word? who has hearkened, and heard?
024	JER	023	019	Behold, [there is] an earthquake from the Lord, and anger proceeds to a convulsion, it shall come violently upon the ungodly.
024	JER	023	020	And the Lord's wrath shall return no more, until he have accomplished it, and until he have established it, according to the purpose of his heart: at the end of the days they shall understand it.
024	JER	023	021	I sent not the prophets, yet they ran: neither spoke I to them, yet they prophesied.
024	JER	023	022	But if they had stood in my counsel, and if they had hearkened to my words, then would they have turned my people from their evil practices.
024	JER	023	023	I am a God nigh at hand, saith the Lord, and not a God afar off.
024	JER	023	024	Shall any one hide himself in secret places, and I not see him? Do I not fill heaven and earth? saith the Lord.
024	JER	023	025	I have heard what the prophets say, what they prophesy in my name, saying falsely, I have seen a night vision.
024	JER	023	026	How long shall [these things] be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies, when they prophesy the purposes of their own heart?
024	JER	023	027	who devise that [men] may forget my law by their dreams, which they have told every one to his neighbour, as their fathers forgot my name in [the worship of] Baal.
024	JER	023	028	The prophet who has a dream, let him tell his dream; and [he] in whom is my word [spoken] to him, let him tell my word truly: what is the chaff to the corn? so are my words, saith the Lord.
024	JER	023	029	Behold, are not my words as fire? saith the Lord; and as an axe cutting the rock?
024	JER	023	030	Behold, I am therefore against the prophets, saith the Lord God, that steal my words every one from his neighbour.
024	JER	023	031	Behold, I am against the prophets that put forth prophecies of mere words, and slumber their sleep.
024	JER	023	032	Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets that prophesy false dreams, and have not told them [truly], and have caused my people to err by their lies, and by their errors; yet I sent them not, and commanded them not; therefore, they shall not profit this people at all.
024	JER	023	033	And if this people, or the priest, or the prophet, should ask, What is the burden of the Lord? then thou shalt say to them, Ye are the burden, and I will dash you down, saith the Lord.
024	JER	023	034	[As for] the prophet, and the priests, and the people, who shall say, The burden of the Lord, I will even take vengeance on that man, and on his house.
024	JER	023	035	Thus shall ye say every one to his neighbour, and every one to his brother, What has the Lord answered? and, what has the Lord said?
024	JER	023	036	And do ye name no more the burden of the Lord; for his own word shall be a man's burden.
024	JER	023	037	But wherefore, [say ye], has the Lord our God spoken?
024	JER	023	038	Therefore thus saith the Lord our God; Because ye have spoken this word, The burden of the Lord, and I sent to you, saying, ye shall not say, The burden of the Lord;
024	JER	023	039	therefore, behold, I [will] seize, and dash down you and the city which I gave to you and your fathers.
024	JER	023	040	And I will bring upon you an everlasting reproach, and everlasting disgrace, which shall not be forgotten.
024	JER	024	001	The Lord shewed me two baskets of figs, lying in front of the temple of the Lord, after Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon had carried captive Jechonias son of Joakim king of Juda, and the princes, and the artificers, and the prisoners, and the rich men out of Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon.
024	JER	024	002	The one basket was [full] of very good figs, as the early figs; and the other basket was [full] of very bad figs, which could not be eaten, for their badness.
024	JER	024	003	And the Lord said to me, What seest thou, Jeremias? and I said, Figs; the good figs, very good; and the bad, very bad, which cannot be eaten, for their badness.
024	JER	024	004	And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
024	JER	024	005	Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel; As these good figs, so will I acknowledge the Jews that have been carried away captive, whom I have sent forth out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans for good.
024	JER	024	006	And I will fix mine eyes upon them for good, and I will restore them into this land for good: and I will build them up, and not pull them down; and I will plant them, and not pluck them up.
024	JER	024	007	And I will give them a heart to know me, that I am the Lord: and they shall be to me a people, and I will be to them a God: for they shall turn to me with all their heart.
024	JER	024	008	And as the bad figs, which cannot be eaten, for their badness; thus saith the Lord, So will I deliver Sedekias king of Juda, and his nobles, and the remnant of Jerusalem, them that are left in this land, and the dwellers in Egypt.
024	JER	024	009	And I will cause them to be dispersed into all the kingdoms of the earth, and they shall be for a reproach, and a proverb, and an [object of] hatred, and a curse, in every place whither I have driven them out.
024	JER	024	010	And I will send against them famine, and pestilence, and the sword, until they are consumed from off the land which I gave them.
024	JER	025	001	THE WORD THAT CAME TO JEREMIAS concerning all the people of Juda in the fourth year of Joakim, son of Josias, king of Juda;
024	JER	025	002	which he spoke to all the people of Juda, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying,
024	JER	025	003	In the thirteenth year of Josias, son of Amos, king of Juda, even until this day for three and twenty years, I have both spoken to you, rising early and speaking,
024	JER	025	004	and I sent to you my servants the prophets, sending them early; (but ye hearkened not, and listened not with your ears;) saying,
024	JER	025	005	Turn ye every one from his evil way, and from your evil practices, and ye shall dwell in the land which I gave to you and your fathers, of old and for ever.
024	JER	025	006	Go ye not after strange gods, to serve them, and to worship them, that ye provoke me not by the works of your hands, to do you hurt.
024	JER	025	007	But ye hearkened not to me.
024	JER	025	008	Therefore thus saith the Lord; Since ye believed not my words,
024	JER	025	009	behold I [will] send and take a family from the north, and will bring them against this land, and against the inhabitants of it, and against all the nations round about it, and I will make them utterly waste, and make them a desolation, and a hissing, and an everlasting reproach.
024	JER	025	010	And I will destroy from [among] them the voice of joy, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the scent of ointment, and the light of a candle.
024	JER	025	011	And all the land shall be a desolation; and they shall serve among the Gentiles seventy years.
024	JER	025	012	And when the seventy years are fulfilled, I will take vengeance on that nation, and will make them a perpetual desolation.
024	JER	025	013	And I will bring upon that land all my words which I have spoken against it, [even] all things that are written in this book.
024	JER	025	034	THE PROPHECIES OF JEREMIAS AGAINST THE NATIONS OF AeLAM.
024	JER	025	035	Thus saith the Lord, The bow of Aelam is broken, [even] the chief of their power.
024	JER	025	036	And I will bring upon Aelam the four winds from the four corners of heaven, and I will disperse them toward all these winds; and there shall be no nation [to] which they shall not come—[even] the outcasts of Aelam.
024	JER	025	037	And I will put them in fear before their enemies that seek their life; and I will bring evils upon them according to my great anger; and I will send forth my sword after them, until I have utterly destroyed them.
024	JER	025	038	And I will set my throne in Aelam, and will send forth thence king and rulers.
024	JER	025	039	But it shall come to pass at the end of days, that I will turn the captivity of Aelam, saith the Lord.
024	JER	026	001	In the beginning of the reign of king Sedekias, there came this word concerning Aelam.
024	JER	026	002	FOR EGYPT, AGAINST THE POWER OF PHARAO NECHAO KING OF EGYPT, who was by the river Euphrates in Charmis, whom Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon smote in the fourth year of Joakim king of Juda.
024	JER	026	003	Take up arms and spears, and draw nigh to battle;
024	JER	026	004	and harness the horses: mount, ye horsemen, and stand ready in your helmets; advance the spears, and put on your breast-plates.
024	JER	026	005	Why do they fear, and turn back? even because their mighty men shall be slain: they have utterly fled, and being hemmed in they have not rallied, saith the Lord.
024	JER	026	006	Let not the swift flee, and let not the mighty man escape to the north: the [forces] at Euphrates are become feeble, and they have fallen.
024	JER	026	007	Who is this [that] shall come up as a river, and as rivers roll [their] waves?
024	JER	026	008	The waters of Egypt shall come up like a river: and he said, I will go up, and will cover the earth, and will destroy the dwellers in it.
024	JER	026	009	Mount ye the horses, prepare the chariots; go forth, ye warriors of the Ethiopians, and Libyans armed with shields; and mount, ye Lydians, bend the bow.
024	JER	026	010	And that day [shall be] to the Lord our God a day of vengeance, to take vengeance on his enemies: and the sword of the Lord shall devour, and be glutted, and be drunken with their blood: for the Lord [has] a sacrifice from the land of the north at the river Euphrates.
024	JER	026	011	Go up to Galaad, and take balm for the virgin daughter of Egypt: in vain hast thou multiplied thy medicines; there is no help in thee.
024	JER	026	012	The nations have heard thy voice, and the land has been filled with thy cry: for the warriors have fainted fighting one against another, [and] both are fallen together.
024	JER	026	013	THE WORDS WHICH THE LORD SPOKE by Jeremias, concerning the coming of the king of Babylon to smite the land of Egypt.
024	JER	026	014	Proclaim [it] at Magdol, and declare [it] at Memphis: say ye, Stand up, and prepare; for the sword has devoured thy yew-tree.
024	JER	026	015	Wherefore has Apis fled from thee? thy choice calf has not remained; for the Lord has utterly weakened him.
024	JER	026	016	And thy multitude has fainted and fallen; and each one said to his neighbour, Let us arise, and return into our country to our people, from the Grecian sword.
024	JER	026	017	Call ye the name of Pharao Nechao king of Egypt, Saon esbeie moed.
024	JER	026	018	[As] I live, saith the Lord God, he shall come as Itabyrion among the mountains, and as Carmel that is on the sea.
024	JER	026	019	O daughter of Egypt dwelling [at home], prepare thee stuff for removing: for Memphis shall be utterly desolate, and shall be called Woe, because there are no inhabitants in it.
024	JER	026	020	Egypt is a fair heifer, [but] destruction from the north is come upon her.
024	JER	026	021	Also her hired [soldiers] in the midst of her are as fatted calves fed in her; for they also have turned, and fled with one accord: they stood not, for the day of destruction was come upon them, and the time of their retribution.
024	JER	026	022	Their voice is as [that] of a hissing serpent, for they go upon the sand; they shall come upon Egypt with axes, as men that cut wood.
024	JER	026	023	They shall cut down her forest, saith the Lord, for [their number] cannot at all be conjectured, for it exceeds the locust in multitude, and they are innumerable.
024	JER	026	024	The daughter of Egypt is confounded; she is delivered into the hands of a people from the north.
024	JER	026	025	Behold, I [will] avenge Ammon her son upon Pharao, and upon them that trust in him.
024	JER	026	027	But fear not thou, my servant Jacob, neither be thou alarmed, Israel: for, behold, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and be at ease, and sleep, and there shall be no one to trouble him.
024	JER	026	028	Fear not thou, my servant Jacob, saith the Lord; for I am with thee: she [that was] without fear and in luxury, has been delivered up: for I will make a full end of every nation among whom I have thrust thee forth; but I will not cause thee to fail: yet will I chastise thee in the way of judgment, and will not hold thee entirely guiltless.
024	JER	027	001	THE WORD OF THE LORD WHICH HE SPOKE AGAINST BABYLON.
024	JER	027	002	Proclaim ye among the Gentiles, and cause the tidings to be heard, and suppress [them] not: say ye, Babylon is taken, Belus is confounded; the fearless, the luxurious Maerodach is delivered up.
024	JER	027	003	For a nation has come up against her from the north, he shall utterly ravage her land, and there shall be none to dwell in it, neither man nor beast.
024	JER	027	004	In those days, and at that time, the children of Israel shall come, they and the children of Juda together; they shall proceed, weeping as they go, seeking the Lord their God.
024	JER	027	005	They shall ask the way till [they come to] Sion, for that way shall they set their face; and they shall come and flee for refuge to the Lord their God; for the everlasting covenant shall not be forgotten.
024	JER	027	006	My people have been lost sheep: their shepherds thrust them out, they caused them to wander on the mountains: they went from mountain to hill, they forgot their resting-place.
024	JER	027	007	All that found them consumed them: their enemies said, Let us not leave them alone, because they have sinned against the Lord: he that gathered their fathers [had] a pasture of righteousness.
024	JER	027	008	Flee ye out of the midst of Babylon, and from the land of the Chaldeans, and go forth, and be as serpents before sleep.
024	JER	027	009	For, behold, I stir up against Babylon the gatherings of nations out of the land of the north; and they shall set themselves in array against her: thence shall she be taken, as the dart of an expert warrior shall not return empty.
024	JER	027	010	And Chaldea shall be a spoil: all that spoil her shall be satisfied.
024	JER	027	011	Because ye rejoiced, and boasted, [while] plundering mine heritage; because ye exulted as calves in the grass, and pushed with the horn as bulls.
024	JER	027	012	Your mother is greatly ashamed; your mother that bore you for prosperity is confounded: [she is] the last of the nations, desolate,
024	JER	027	013	by reason of the Lord's anger: it shall not be inhabited, but it shall be all a desolation; and every one that passes through Babylon shall scowl, and they shall hiss at all her plague.
024	JER	027	014	Set yourselves in array against Babylon round about, all ye that bend the bow; shoot at her, spare not your arrows,
024	JER	027	015	and prevail against her: her hands are weakened, her bulwarks are fallen, and her wall is broken down: for it is vengeance from God: take vengeance upon her; as she has done, do to her.
024	JER	027	016	Utterly destroy seed out of Babylon, [and] him that holds a sickle in time of harvest: for fear of the Grecian sword, they shall return every one to his people, and every one shall flee to his own land.
024	JER	027	017	Israel is a wandering sheep; the lions have driven him out: the king of Assyria first devoured him, and afterward this king of Babylon [has gnawed] his bones.
024	JER	027	018	Therefore thus saith the Lord; Behold, I [will] take vengeance on the king of Babylon, and upon his land, as I took vengeance on the king of Assyria.
024	JER	027	019	And I will restore Israel to his pasture, and he shall feed on Carmel and on mount Ephraim and in Galaad, and his soul shall be satisfied.
024	JER	027	020	In those days, and at that time, they shall seek for the iniquity of Israel, and there shall be none; and for the sins of Juda, and they shall not be found: for I will be merciful to them that are left
024	JER	027	021	on the land, saith the Lord. Go up against it roughly, and against them that dwell on it: avenge, O sword, and destroy utterly, saith the Lord, and do according to all that I command thee.
024	JER	027	022	A sound of war, and great destruction in the land of the Chaldeans!
024	JER	027	023	How is the hammer of the whole earth broken and crushed! How is Babylon become a desolation among the nations!
024	JER	027	024	They shall come upon thee, and thou shalt not know it, Babylon, that thou wilt even be taken captive: thou art found and taken, because thou didst resist the Lord.
024	JER	027	025	The Lord has opened his treasury, and brought forth the weapons of his anger: for the Lord God [has] a work in the land of the Chaldeans.
024	JER	027	026	For her times are come: open ye her storehouses: search her as a cave, and utterly destroy her: let there be no remnant of her.
024	JER	027	027	Dry ye up all her fruits, and let them go down to the slaughter: woe to them! for their day is come, and the time of their retribution.
024	JER	027	028	A voice of men fleeing and escaping from the land of Babylon, to declare to Sion the vengeance [that comes] from the Lord our God.
024	JER	027	029	Summon many against Babylon, [even] every one that bends the bow: camp against her round about; let no one of her [people] escape: render to her according to her works; according to all that she has done, do to her: for she has resisted the Lord, the Holy God of Israel.
024	JER	027	030	Therefore shall her young men fall in the streets, and all her warriors shall be cast down, saith the Lord.
024	JER	027	031	Behold, I am against thee the haughty one, saith the Lord: for thy day is come, and the time of thy retribution.
024	JER	027	032	And thy pride shall fail, and fall, and there shall be no one to set it up again: and I will kindle a fire in her forest, and it shall devour all things round about her.
024	JER	027	033	Thus saith the Lord; The children of Israel and the children of Juda have been oppressed: all they that have taken them captive have oppressed them together; for they would not let them go.
024	JER	027	034	But their Redeemer is strong; the Lord Almighty is his name: he will enter into judgment with his adversaries, that he may destroy the earth;
024	JER	027	035	and he will sharpen a sword against the Chaldeans, and against the inhabitants of Babylon, and upon her nobles and upon her wise men;
024	JER	027	036	a sword upon her warriors, and they shall be weakened: a sword upon their horses, and upon their chariots:
024	JER	027	037	a sword upon their warriors and upon the mixed people in the midst of her; and they shall be as women: a sword upon the treasures, and they shall be scattered upon her water,
024	JER	027	038	and they shall be ashamed: for it is a land of graven [images]; and in the islands, where they boasted.
024	JER	027	039	Therefore shall idols dwell in the islands, and the young of monsters shall dwell in it: it shall not be inhabited any more for ever.
024	JER	027	040	As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities bordering upon them, saith the Lord: no man shall dwell there, and no son of man shall sojourn there.
024	JER	027	041	Behold, a people comes from the north, and a great nation, and many kings shall be stirred up from the end of the earth; holding bow and dagger:
024	JER	027	042	[the people] is fierce, and will have no mercy: their voices shall sound as the sea, they shall ride upon horses, prepared for war, like fire, against thee, O daughter of Babylon.
024	JER	027	043	The king of Babylon heard the sound of them, and his hands were enfeebled: anguish overcame him, pangs as of a woman in travail.
024	JER	027	044	Behold, he shall come up as a lion from Jordan to Gaethan; for I will speedily drive them from her, and I will set all the youths against her: for who is like me? and who will resist me? and who is this shepherd who will stand before me?
024	JER	027	045	Therefore hear ye the counsel of the Lord, which he has taken against Babylon; and his devices, which he has devised upon the Chaldeans inhabiting [it]: surely lambs of their flock shall be destroyed: surely pasture shall be cut off from them.
024	JER	027	046	For at the sound of the taking of Babylon the earth shall quake, and a cry shall be heard among the nations.
024	JER	028	001	Thus saith the Lord; Behold, I stir up against Babylon, and against the Chaldeans dwelling therein, a deadly burning wind.
024	JER	028	002	And I will send forth against Babylon spoilers, and they shall spoil her, and shall ravage her land. Woe to Babylon round about [her] in the day of her affliction.
024	JER	028	003	Let the archer bend his bow, and him that has armour put it on: and spare ye not her young men, but destroy ye all her host.
024	JER	028	004	And slain men shall fall in the land of the Chaldeans, and [men] pierced through shall fall without it.
024	JER	028	005	For Israel and Juda have not been forsaken of their God, of the Lord Almighty; whereas their land was filled with iniquity against the holy things of Israel.
024	JER	028	006	Flee ye out of the midst of Babylon, and deliver every one his soul: and be not overthrown in her iniquity; for it is the time of her retribution from the Lord; he is rendering to her a recompence.
024	JER	028	007	Babylon has been a golden cup in the Lord's hand, causing all the earth to be drunken: the nations have drunk of her wine; therefore they were shaken.
024	JER	028	008	And Babylon is fallen suddenly, and is broken to pieces: lament for her; take balm for her deadly wound, if by any means she may be healed.
024	JER	028	009	We tried to heal Babylon, but she was not healed: let us forsake her, and depart every one to his own country: for her judgment has reached to the heaven, it has mounted up to the stars.
024	JER	028	010	The Lord has brought forth his judgment: come, and let us declare in Sion the works of the Lord our God.
024	JER	028	011	Prepare the arrows; fill the quivers: the Lord has stirred up the spirit of the king of the Medes: for his wrath is against Babylon, to destroy it utterly; for it is the Lord's vengeance, it is the vengeance of his people.
024	JER	028	012	Lift up a standard on the walls of Babylon, prepare the quivers, rouse the guards, prepare the weapons: for the Lord has taken [the work] in hand, and will execute what he has spoken against the inhabitants of Babylon,
024	JER	028	013	dwelling on many waters, and amidst the abundance of her treasures; thine end is come verily into thy bowels.
024	JER	028	014	For the Lord has sworn by his arm, [saying,]I will fill thee with men as with locusts; and they that come down shall cry against thee.
024	JER	028	015	The Lord made the earth by his power, preparing the world by his wisdom, by his understanding he stretched out the heaven.
024	JER	028	016	At [his] voice he makes a sound of water in the heaven, and brings up clouds from the extremity of the earth; he makes lightnings for rain, and brings light out of his treasures.
024	JER	028	017	Every man has completely lost understanding; every goldsmith is confounded because of his graven [images]: for they have cast false [gods], there is no breath in them.
024	JER	028	018	They are vain works, objects of scorn; in the time of their visitation they shall perish.
024	JER	028	019	Not such is Jacob's portion; for he that formed all things, he is his inheritance; the Lord is his name.
024	JER	028	020	Thou scatterest for me the weapons of war: and I will scatter nations by thee, and will destroy kings by means of thee.
024	JER	028	021	And by thee I will scatter the horse and his rider; and by thee I will scatter chariots and them that ride in them.
024	JER	028	022	And by thee I will scatter youth and maid; and by thee I will scatter man and woman.
024	JER	028	023	And by thee I will scatter the shepherd and his flock; and by thee I will scatter the husbandman and his husbandry; and by thee I will scatter leaders and the captains.
024	JER	028	024	And I will recompense to Babylon and to all the Chaldeans that dwell [there] all their mischiefs that they have done to Sion before your eyes, saith the Lord.
024	JER	028	025	Behold, I am against thee, the ruined mountain, that destroys the whole earth; and I will stretch out mine hand upon thee, and will roll thee down upon the rocks, and will make thee as a burnt mountain.
024	JER	028	026	And they shall not take from thee a stone for a corner, nor a stone for a foundation: for thou shalt be a desolation for ever, saith the Lord.
024	JER	028	027	Lift up a standard in the land, sound the trumpet among the nations, consecrate the nations against her, raise up kings against her by me, and [that] for the people of Achanaz; set against her engines of war; bring up against her horses as a multitude of locusts.
024	JER	028	028	Bring up nations against her, [even] the king of the Medes and of the whole earth, his rulers, and all his captains.
024	JER	028	029	The earth has quaked and been troubled, because the purpose of the Lord has risen up against Babylon, to make the land of Babylon a desolation, and uninhabitable.
024	JER	028	030	The warrior of Babylon has failed to fight; they shall sit there in the siege; their power is broken; they are become like women; her tabernacles have been set on fire; her bars are broken.
024	JER	028	031	One shall rush, running to meet [another] runner, and one [shall go] with tidings to meet [another] with tidings, to bring tidings to the king of Babylon, that his city is taken.
024	JER	028	032	At the end of his passages they were taken, and his cisterns they have burnt with fire, and his warriors are going forth.
024	JER	028	033	For thus saith the Lord, The houses of the king of Babylon shall be threshed as a floor in the season; yet a little while, and her harvest shall come.
024	JER	028	034	He has devoured me, he has torn me asunder, airy darkness has come upon me; Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon has swallowed me up, as a dragon has he filled his belly with my delicacies.
024	JER	028	035	My troubles and my distresses have driven me out into Babylon, shall she that dwells in Sion say; and my blood [shall be] upon the Chaldeans dwelling [there], shall Jerusalem say.
024	JER	028	036	Therefore thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will judge thine adversary, and I will execute vengeance for thee; and I will waste her sea, and dry up her fountain.
024	JER	028	037	And Babylon shall be a desolation, and shall not be inhabited.
024	JER	028	038	For they rose up together as lions, and as lions' whelps.
024	JER	028	039	In their heat I will give them a draught, and make them drunk, that they may be stupified, and sleep an everlasting sleep, and not awake, saith the Lord.
024	JER	028	040	And bring thou them down as lambs to the slaughter, and rams with kids.
024	JER	028	041	How has the boast of all the earth been taken and caught in a snare! how has Babylon become a desolation among the nations!
024	JER	028	042	The sea has come up upon Babylon with the sound of its waves, and she is covered.
024	JER	028	043	Her cities are become like a dry and trackless land; not so much as one [man] shall dwell in it, neither shall a son of man lodge in it.
024	JER	028	044	And I will take vengeance on Babylon, and bring forth out of her mouth what she has swallowed down, and the nations shall no more be gathered to her:
024	JER	028	049	and in Babylon the slain men of all the earth shall fall.
024	JER	028	050	Go forth of the land, ye that escape, and stay not; ye that are afar off, remember the Lord, and let Jerusalem come into your mind.
024	JER	028	051	We are ashamed, because we have heard our reproach; disgrace has covered our face; aliens are come into our sanctuary, [even] into the house of the Lord.
024	JER	028	052	Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will take vengeance upon her graven [images]: and slain men shall fall in all her land.
024	JER	028	053	For though Babylon should go up as the heaven, and though she should strengthen her walls with her power, from me shall come they that shall destroy her, saith the Lord.
024	JER	028	054	A sound of a cry in Babylon, and great destruction in the land of the Chaldeans:
024	JER	028	055	for the Lord has utterly destroyed Babylon, and cut off from her the great voice sounding as many waters: he has consigned her voice to destruction.
024	JER	028	056	For distress has come upon Babylon, her warriors are taken, their bows are useless: for God recompenses them.
024	JER	028	057	The Lord recompenses, and will make her leaders and her wise men and her captains completely drunk, saith the King, the Lord Almighty is his name.
024	JER	028	058	Thus saith the Lord, The wall of Babylon was made broad, but it shall be completely broken down, and her high gates shall be burnt with fire; and the peoples shall not labour in vain, nor the nations fail in [their] rule.
024	JER	028	059	THE WORD WHICH THE LORD COMMANDED THE PROPHET JEREMIAS to say to Saraeas son of Nerias, son of Maasaeas, when he went from Sedekias king of Juda to Babylon, in the fourth year of his reign. And Saraeas was over the bounties.
024	JER	028	060	And Jeremias wrote in a book all the evils which should come upon Babylon, [even] all these words that are written against Babylon.
024	JER	028	061	And Jeremias said to Saraeas, When thou art come to Babylon, and shalt see and read all these words;
024	JER	028	062	then thou shalt say, O Lord God, thou hast spoken against this place, to destroy it, and that there should be none to dwell in it, neither man nor beast; for it shall be a desolation for ever.
024	JER	028	063	And it shall come to pass, when thou shalt cease from reading this book, that thou shalt bind a stone upon it, and cast it into the midst of Euphrates;
024	JER	028	064	and shalt say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and not rise, because of the evils which I bring upon it.
024	JER	029	001	THUS SAITH THE LORD AGAINST THE PHILISTINES;
024	JER	029	002	Behold, waters come up from the north, and shall become a sweeping torrent, and it shall sweep away the land, and its fulness; the city, and them that dwell in it: and men shall cry and all that dwell in the land shall howl,
024	JER	029	003	at the sound of his rushing, at [the sound of] his hoofs, and at the rattling of his chariots, at the noise of his wheels: the fathers turned not to their children because of the weakness of their hands,
024	JER	029	004	in the day that is coming to destroy all the Philistines: and I will utterly destroy Tyre and Sidon and all the rest of their allies: for the Lord will destroy the remaining [inhabitants] of the islands.
024	JER	029	005	Baldness is come upon Gaza; Ascalon is cast away, and the remnant of the Enakim.
024	JER	029	006	How long wilt thou smite, O sword of the Lord? how long will it be ere thou art quiet? return into thy sheath, rest, and be removed.
024	JER	029	007	How shall it be quiet, whereas the Lord has given it a commission against Ascalon, and against the regions on the sea-coast, to awake against the remaining [countries]! CONCERNING IDUMEA, thus saith the Lord; There is no longer wisdom in Thaeman, counsel has perished from the wise ones, their wisdom is gone,
024	JER	029	008	their place has been deceived. Dig deep for a dwelling, ye that inhabit Daedam, for he has wrought grievously: I brought trouble upon him in the time at which I visited him.
024	JER	029	009	For grape-gatherers are come, who shall not leave thee a remnant; as thieves by night, they shall lay their hand upon [thy possessions].
024	JER	029	010	For I have stripped Esau, I have uncovered their secret places; they shall have no power to hide themselves, they have perished [each] by the hand of his brother, my neighbour, and it is impossible
024	JER	029	011	for thy fatherless one to be left to live, but I shall live, and the widows trust in me.
024	JER	029	012	For thus saith the Lord; They who were not appointed to drink the cup have drunk [it]; and thou shalt by no means be cleared:
024	JER	029	013	for by myself I have sworn, saith the Lord, that thou shalt be in the midst of her an impassable [land], and a reproach, and a curse; and all her cities shall be desert for ever.
024	JER	029	014	I have heard a report from the Lord, and he has sent messengers to the nations, [saying,]Assemble yourselves, and come against her; rise ye up to war.
024	JER	029	015	I have made thee small among the nations, utterly contemptible among men.
024	JER	029	016	Thine insolence has risen up against thee, the fierceness of thine heart has burst the holes of the rocks, it has seized upon the strength of a lofty hill; for as an eagle he set his nest on high: thence will I bring thee down.
024	JER	029	017	And Idumea shall be a desert: every one that passes by shall hiss at it.
024	JER	029	018	As Sodom was overthrown and Gomorrha and they that sojourned in her, saith the Lord Almighty, no man shall dwell there, nor shall any son of man inhabit there.
024	JER	029	019	Behold, he shall come up as a lion out of the midst of Jordan to the place of Aetham: for I will speedily drive them from it, and do ye set the young men against her: for who is like me? and who will withstand me? and who [is] this shepherd, who shall confront me?
024	JER	029	020	Therefore hear ye the counsel of the Lord, which he has framed against Idumea; and his device, which he has devised against the inhabitants of Thaeman: surely the least of the sheep shall be swept off; surely their dwelling shall be made desolate for them.
024	JER	029	021	For at the sound of their fall the earth was scared, and the cry of the sea was not heard.
024	JER	029	022	Behold, he shall look [upon her] as an eagle, and spread forth [his] wings over her strongholds; and the heart of the mighty men of Idumea shall be in that day as the heart of a woman in her pangs.
024	JER	030	001	CONCERNING THE SONS OF AMMON thus saith the Lord, Are there no sons in Israel? or have they no one to succeed [them]? wherefore has Melchol inherited Galaad, and why shall their people dwell in their cities?
024	JER	030	002	Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will cause to be heard in Rabbath a tumult of wars; and they shall become a waste and ruined place, and her altars shall be burned with fire; then shall Israel succeed to his dominion.
024	JER	030	003	Howl, O Esebon, for Gai has perished; cry, ye daughters of Rabbath, gird yourselves with sack-clothes, and lament; for Melchol shall go into banishment, his priests and his princes together.
024	JER	030	004	Why do ye exult in the plains of the Enakim, thou haughty daughter, that trustest in [thy] treasures, that sayest, Who shall come in to me?
024	JER	030	005	Behold, I [will] bring terror upon thee, saith the Lord, from all the country round about thee; and ye shall be scattered every one right before him, and there is none to gather you.
024	JER	030	023	CONCERNING DAMASCUS. Emath is brought to shame, and Arphath: for they have heard an evil report: they are amazed, they are angry, they shall be utterly unable to rest.
024	JER	030	024	Damascus is utterly weakened, she is put to flight; trembling has seized upon her.
024	JER	030	025	How has she not left my city, they have loved the village?
024	JER	030	026	Therefore shall the young men fall in thy streets, and all thy warriors shall fall, saith the Lord.
024	JER	030	027	And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall devour the streets of the son of Ader.
024	JER	030	028	CONCERNING KEDAR THE QUEEN OF THE PALACE, WHOM NABUCHODONOSOR KING OF BABYLON SMOTE, thus saith the Lord; Arise ye, and go up to Kedar, and fill the sons of Kedem.
024	JER	030	029	They shall take their tents and their sheep, they shall take for themselves their garments, and all their baggage and their camels; and summon ye destruction against them from every side.
024	JER	030	030	Flee ye, dig very deep for a dwelling-place, ye that dwell in the palace; for the king of Babylon has framed a counsel, and devised a device against you.
024	JER	030	031	Rise up, and go up against a nation settled [and] dwelling at ease, who have no doors, nor bolts, nor bars, [who] dwell alone.
024	JER	030	032	And their camels shall be a spoil, and the multitude of their cattle shall be destroyed: and I will scatter them as chaff with every wind, having their hair cut about their foreheads, I will bring on their overthrow from all sides, saith the Lord.
024	JER	030	033	And the palace shall be a resting-place for ostriches, and desolate for ever: no man shall abide there, and no son of man shall dwell there.
024	JER	031	001	Thus has the Lord said concerning MOAB, Woe to Nabau! for it has perished: Cariathaim is taken: Amath and Agath are put to shame.
024	JER	031	002	There is no longer any healing for Moab, [nor] glorying in Esebon: he has devised evils against her: we have cut her off from [being] a nation, and she shall be completely still: after thee shall go a sword;
024	JER	031	003	for [there is] a voice of [men] crying out of Oronaim, destruction and great ruin.
024	JER	031	004	Moab is ruined, proclaim [it] to Zogora:
024	JER	031	005	for Aloth is filled with weeping: one shall go up weeping by the way of Oronaim; ye have heard a cry of destruction.
024	JER	031	006	Flee ye, and save your lives, and ye shall be as a wild ass in the desert.
024	JER	031	007	Since thou hast trusted in thy strong-hold, therefore thou shalt be taken: and Chamos shall go forth into captivity, and his priests, and his princes together.
024	JER	031	008	And destruction shall come upon every city, it shall by no means escape; the valley also shall perish, and the plain country shall be completely destroyed, as the Lord has said.
024	JER	031	009	Set marks upon Moab, for she shall be touched with a plague-spot, and all her cities shall become desolate; whence [shall there be] an inhabitant for her?
024	JER	031	010	Cursed is the man that does the works of the Lord carelessly, keeping back his sword from blood.
024	JER	031	011	Moab has been at ease from a child, and trusted in his glory; he has not poured out [his liquor] from vessel to vessel, and has not gone into banishment, therefore his taste remained in him, and his smell departed not.
024	JER	031	012	Therefore, behold, his days come, saith the Lord, when I shall send upon him bad leaders, and they shall lead him astray, and they shall utterly break in pieces his possessions, and shall cut his horns asunder.
024	JER	031	013	And Moab shall be ashamed of Chamos, as the house of Israel was ashamed of Baethel their hope, having trusted in them.
024	JER	031	014	How will ye say, We are strong, and men strong for war?
024	JER	031	015	Moab is ruined, [even] his city, and his choice young men have gone down to slaughter.
024	JER	031	016	The day of Moab is near at hand, and his iniquity moves swiftly [to vengeance].
024	JER	031	017	Shake [the head] at him, all ye that are round about him; all [of you] utter his name; say ye, How is the glorious staff broken to pieces, the rod of magnificence!
024	JER	031	018	Come down from [thy] glory, and sit down in a damp place: Daebon shall be broken, because Moab is destroyed: there has gone up against thee one to ravage thy strong-hold.
024	JER	031	019	Stand by the way, and look, thou that dwellest in Arer; and ask him that is fleeing, and him that escapes, and say, What has happened?
024	JER	031	020	Moab is put to shame, because he is broken: howl and cry; proclaim in Arnon, that Moab has perished.
024	JER	031	021	And judgment is coming against the land of Misor, upon Chelon, and Rephas, and Mophas,
024	JER	031	022	and upon Daebon, and upon Nabau, and upon the house of Daethlathaim,
024	JER	031	023	and upon Cariathaim, and upon the house of Gaemol, and upon the house of Maon,
024	JER	031	024	and upon Carioth, and upon Bosor, and upon all the cities of Moab, far and near.
024	JER	031	025	The horn of Moab is broken, and his arm is crushed.
024	JER	031	026	Make ye him drunk; for he has magnified himself against the Lord: and Moab shall clap with his hand, and shall be also himself a laughing-stock.
024	JER	031	027	For surely Israel was to thee a laughing-stock, and was found among thy thefts, because thou didst fight against him.
024	JER	031	028	The inhabitants of Moab have left the cities, and dwelt in rocks; they have become as doves nestling in rocks, at the mouth of a cave.
024	JER	031	029	And I have heard of the pride of Moab, he has greatly heightened his pride and his haughtiness, and his heart has been lifted up.
024	JER	031	030	But I know his works: is it not enough for him? has he not done thus?
024	JER	031	031	Therefore howl ye for Moab on all sides; cry out against the shorn men [in] a gloomy place. I will weep for thee,
024	JER	031	032	O vine of Aserema, as with the weeping of Jazer: thy branches are gone over the sea, they reached the cities of Jazer: destruction has come upon thy fruits, [and] upon thy grape-gatherers.
024	JER	031	033	Joy and gladness have been utterly swept off the land of Moab: and [though] there was wine in thy presses, in the morning they trod it not, neither in the evening did they raise the cry of joy.
024	JER	031	034	From the cry of Esebon even to Aetam their cities uttered their voice, from Zogor to Oronaim, and their tidings [as] a heifer of three years old, for the water also of Nebrin shall be dried up.
024	JER	031	035	And I will destroy Moab, saith the Lord, as he comes up to the altar, and burns incense to his gods.
024	JER	031	036	Therefore the heart of Moab shall sound as pipes, my heart shall sound as a pipe for the shorn men; forasmuch as what [every] man has gained has perished from him.
024	JER	031	037	They shall all have their heads shaved in every place, and every beard shall be shaved; and all hands shall beat [the breasts], and on all loins shall be sackcloth.
024	JER	031	038	And on all the housetops of Moab, and in his streets [shall be mourning]: for I have broken [him], saith the Lord, as a vessel, which is useless.
024	JER	031	039	How has he changed! how has Moab turned [his] back! Moab is put to shame, and become a laughing-stock, and an object of anger to all that are round about him.
024	JER	031	040	For thus said the Lord;
024	JER	031	041	Carioth is taken, and the strong-holds have been taken together.
024	JER	031	042	And Moab shall perish from being a multitude, because he has magnified himself against the Lord.
024	JER	031	043	A snare, and fear, and the pit, are upon thee, O inhabitant of Moab.
024	JER	031	044	He that flees from the terror shall fall into the pit, and he that comes up out of the pit shall even be taken in the snare: for I will bring these things upon Moab in the year of their visitation.
024	JER	032	001	Thus said the Lord God of Israel; Take the cup of this unmixed wine from mine hand, and thou shalt cause all the nations to drink, to whom I send thee.
024	JER	032	016	And they shall drink, and vomit, and be mad, because of the sword which I send among them.
024	JER	032	017	So I took the cup out of the Lord's hand, and caused the nations to whom the Lord sent me to drink:
024	JER	032	018	Jerusalem, and the cities of Juda, and the kings of Juda, and his princes, to make them a desert place, a desolation, and a hissing;
024	JER	032	019	and Pharao king of Egypt, and his servants, and his nobles, and all his people;
024	JER	032	020	and all the mingled [people], and all the kings of the Philistines, and Ascalon, and Gaza, and Accaron, and the remnant of Azotus,
024	JER	032	021	and Idumea, and the land of Moab, and the children of Ammon,
024	JER	032	022	and the kings of Tyre, and the kings of Sidon, and the kings in the [country] beyond the sea,
024	JER	032	023	and Daedan, and Thaeman, and Ros, and every one that is shaved round about the face,
024	JER	032	024	and all the mingled [people] lodging in the wilderness,
024	JER	032	025	and all the kings of Aelam, and all the kings of the Persians,
024	JER	032	026	and all the kings from the north, the far and the near, each one with his brother, and all the kingdoms which are on the face of the earth.
024	JER	032	027	And thou shalt say to them, Thus said the Lord Almighty; Drink ye, be ye drunken; and ye shall vomit, and shall fall, and shall in nowise rise, because of the sword which I send among you.
024	JER	032	028	And it shall come to pass, when they refuse to take the cup out of thine hand, to drink it, that thou shalt say, Thus said the Lord; Ye shall surely drink.
024	JER	032	029	For I am beginning to afflict the city whereon my name is called, and ye shall by no means be held guiltless: for I am calling a sword upon all that dwell upon the earth.
024	JER	032	030	And thou shalt prophesy against them these words, and shalt say, The Lord shall speak from on high, from his sanctuary he will utter his voice; he will pronounce a declaration on his place; and these shall answer like men gathering grapes: and destruction is coming on them that dwell on the earth,
024	JER	032	031	[even] upon [the extreme] part of the earth; for the Lord [has] a controversy with the nations, he is pleading with all flesh, and the ungodly are given to the sword, saith the Lord.
024	JER	032	032	Thus said the Lord; Behold, evils are proceeding from nation to nation, and a great whirlwind goes forth from the end of the earth.
024	JER	032	033	And the slain of the Lord shall be in the day of the Lord from [one] end of the earth even to the [other] end of the earth: they shall not be buried; they shall be as dung on the face of the earth.
024	JER	032	034	Howl, ye shepherds, and cry; and lament, ye rams of the flock: for your days have been completed for slaughter, and ye shall fall as the choice rams.
024	JER	032	035	And flight shall perish from the shepherds, and safety from the rams of the flock.
024	JER	032	036	A voice of the crying of the shepherds, and a moaning of the sheep and the rams: for the Lord has destroyed their pastures.
024	JER	032	037	And the peaceable abodes that remain shall be destroyed before the fierceness of my anger.
024	JER	032	038	He has forsaken his lair, as a lion: for their land is become desolate before the great sword.
024	JER	033	001	IN THE BEGINNING OF THE REIGN OF KING JOAKIM SON OF JOSIAS THERE CAME THIS WORD FROM THE LORD.
024	JER	033	002	Thus said the Lord; Stand in the court of the Lord's house, and thou shalt declare to all the Jews, and to all that come to worship in the house of the Lord, all the words which I commanded thee to speak to them; abate not one word.
024	JER	033	003	Peradventure they will hear, and turn every one from his evil way: then I will cease from the evils which I purpose to do to them, because of their evil practices.
024	JER	033	004	And thou shalt say, Thus said the Lord; If ye will not hearken to me, to walk in my statutes which I set before you,
024	JER	033	005	to hearken to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I send to you early in the morning; yea, I sent them, but ye hearkened not to me;
024	JER	033	006	then will I make this house as Selo, and I will make [this] city a curse to all the nations of all the earth.
024	JER	033	007	And the priests, and the false prophets, and all the people heard Jeremias speaking these words in the house of the Lord.
024	JER	033	008	And it came to pass, when Jeremias had ceased speaking all that the Lord had ordered him to speak to all the people, that the priests and the false prophets and all the people took him, saying,
024	JER	033	009	Thou shalt surely die, because thou hast prophesied in the name of the Lord, saying, This house shall be as Selo, and this city shall be made quite destitute of inhabitants. And all the people assembled against Jeremias in the house of the Lord.
024	JER	033	010	And the princes of Juda heard this word, and they went up out of the house of the king to the house of the Lord, and sat in the entrance of the new gate.
024	JER	033	011	Then the priests and the false prophets said to the princes and to all the people, The judgment of death [is due] to this man; because he has prophesied against this city, as ye have heard with your ears.
024	JER	033	012	Then Jeremias spoke to the princes, and to all the people, saying, The Lord sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city, all the words which ye have heard.
024	JER	033	013	And now amend your ways and your works, and hearken to the voice of the Lord; and the Lord shall cease from the evils which he has pronounced against you.
024	JER	033	014	And behold, I am in your hands; do to me as is expedient, and as it is best for you.
024	JER	033	015	But know for a certainty, that if ye slay me, ye bring innocent blood upon yourselves, and upon this city, and upon them that dwell in it; for in truth the Lord has sent me to you to speak in your ears all these words.
024	JER	033	016	Then the princes and all the people said to the priests and to the false prophets; Judgment of death is not [due] to this man; for he has spoken to us in the name of the Lord our God.
024	JER	033	017	And there rose up men of the elders of the land, and said to all the assembly of the people,
024	JER	033	018	Michaeas the Morathite lived in the days of Ezekias king of Juda, and said to all the people of Juda, Thus saith the Lord; Sion shall be ploughed as a field, and Jerusalem shall become a desolation, and the mountain of the house shall be a thicket of trees.
024	JER	033	019	Did Ezekias and all Juda in any way slay him? Was it not that they feared the Lord, and they made supplication before the Lord, and the Lord ceased from the evils which he [had] pronounced against them? whereas we have wrought great evil against our own souls.
024	JER	033	020	And there was [another] man prophesying in the name of the Lord, Urias the son of Samaeas of Cariathiarim; and he prophesied concerning this land according to all the words of Jeremias.
024	JER	033	021	And king Joakim and all the princes heard all his words, and sought to slay him; and Urias heard [it] and went into Egypt.
024	JER	033	022	And the king sent men into Egypt;
024	JER	033	023	and they brought him thence, and brought him into the king; and he smote him with the sword, and cast him into the sepulchre of the children of his people.
024	JER	033	024	Nevertheless the hand of Achicam son of Saphan was with Jeremias, to prevent his being delivered into the hands of the people, or being killed.
024	JER	034	001	Thus said the Lord; Make to thyself bonds and yokes, and put [them] about thy neck,
024	JER	034	003	and thou shalt send them to the king of Idumea, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the children of Ammon, and to the king of Tyre, and to the king of Sidon, by the hands of their messengers that come to meet them at Jerusalem to Sedekias king of Juda.
024	JER	034	004	And thou shalt commission them to say to their lords, Thus said the Lord God of Israel; Thus shall ye say to your lords;
024	JER	034	005	I have made the earth by my great power, and with my high arm, and I will give it to whomsoever it shall seem [good] in mine eyes.
024	JER	034	006	I gave the earth to Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon to serve him, and the wild beasts of the field to labour for him.
024	JER	034	008	And the nation and kingdom, all that shall not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, with sword and famine will I visit them, saith the Lord, until they are consumed by his hand.
024	JER	034	009	And hearken ye not to your false prophets, nor to them that divine to you, nor to them that foretell events by dreams to you, nor to your auguries, nor your sorcerers, that say, Ye shall by no means work for the king of Babylon:
024	JER	034	010	for they prophesy lies to you, to remove you far from your land.
024	JER	034	011	But the nation which shall put its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him, I will even leave it upon its land, and it shall serve him, and dwell in it.
024	JER	034	012	I spoke also to Sedekias king of Juda according to all these words, saying, Put your neck into [the yoke], and serve the king of Babylon.
024	JER	034	014	For they prophesy unrighteous [words] to you,
024	JER	034	015	for I sent them not, saith the Lord; and they prophesy [in] my name unjustly, that I might destroy you, and ye should perish, and your prophets, who unrighteously prophesy lies to you.
024	JER	034	016	I spoke to you, and to all this people, and to the priests, saying, Thus said the Lord; Hearken not to the words of the prophets that prophesy to you, saying, Behold, the vessels of the Lord's house shall return from Babylon: for they prophesy to you unrighteous [words].
024	JER	034	017	I sent them not.
024	JER	034	018	If they are prophets, and if the word of the Lord is in them, let them meet me, for thus has the Lord said.
024	JER	034	019	And as for the remaining vessels,
024	JER	034	020	which the king of Babylon took not, when he carried Jechonias prisoner out of Jerusalem,
024	JER	034	022	they shall go into Babylon, saith the Lord.
024	JER	035	001	And it came to pass in the fourth year of Sedekias king of Juda, in the fifth month, [that] Ananias the false prophet, the son of Azor, from Gabaon, spoke to me in the house of the Lord, in the sight of the priests and all the people, saying,
024	JER	035	002	Thus saith the Lord; I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.
024	JER	035	003	Yet two full years, and I will return into this place the vessels of the house of the Lord,
024	JER	035	004	and Jechonias, and the captivity of Juda: for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.
024	JER	035	005	Then Jeremias spoke to Ananias in the sight of all the people, and in the sight of the priests that stood in the house of the Lord,
024	JER	035	006	and Jeremias said, May the Lord indeed do thus; may he confirm thy word which thou dost prophesy, to return the vessels of the house of the Lord, and all the captivity, out of Babylon to this place.
024	JER	035	007	Nevertheless hear ye the word of the Lord which I speak in your ears, and in the ears of all the people.
024	JER	035	008	The prophets that were before me and before you of old, also prophesied over much country, and against great kingdoms, concerning war.
024	JER	035	009	[As for] the prophet that has prophesied for peace, when the word has come [to pass], they shall know the prophet whom the Lord has sent them in truth.
024	JER	035	010	Then Ananias took the yokes from the neck of Jeremias in the sight of all the people, and broke them to pieces.
024	JER	035	011	And Ananias spoke in the presence of all the people, saying, Thus said the Lord; Thus will I break the yoke of the king of Babylon from the necks of all the nations. And Jeremias went his way.
024	JER	035	012	And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias, after that Ananias had broken the yokes off his neck, saying,
024	JER	035	013	Go and speak to Ananias, saying, Thus saith the Lord; Thou hast broken the yokes of wood; but I will make instead of them yokes of iron.
024	JER	035	014	For thus said the Lord, I have put a yoke of iron on the neck of all the nations, that they may serve the king of Babylon.
024	JER	035	015	And Jeremias said to Ananias, The Lord has not sent thee; and thou hast caused this people to trust in unrighteousness.
024	JER	035	016	Therefore thus said the Lord: Behold, I [will] cast thee off from the face of the earth: this year thou shalt die.
024	JER	035	017	So he died in the seventh month.
024	JER	036	001	And these are the words of the book which Jeremias sent from Jerusalem to the elders of the captivity, and to the priests, and to the false prophets, even an epistle to Babylon for the captivity, and to all the people;
024	JER	036	002	(after the departure of Jechonias the king and the queen, and the eunuchs, and every freeman, and bondman, and artificer, out of Jerusalem;)
024	JER	036	003	by the hand of Eleasan son of Saphan, and Gamarias son of Chelcias, (whom Sedekias king of Juda sent to the king of Babylon to Babylon) saying,
024	JER	036	004	Thus said the Lord God of Israel concerning the captivity which I caused to be carried away from Jerusalem;
024	JER	036	005	Build ye houses, and inhabit [them]; and plant gardens, and eat the fruits thereof;
024	JER	036	006	and take ye wives, and beget sons and daughters; and take wives for your sons, and give your daughters to husbands, and be multiplied, and be not diminished.
024	JER	036	007	And seek the peace of the land into which I have carried you captive, and ye shall pray to the Lord for the people: for in its peace ye shall [have] peace.
024	JER	036	008	For thus saith the Lord; Let not the false prophets that are among you persuade you, and let not your diviners persuade you, and hearken not to your dreams which ye dream.
024	JER	036	009	For they prophesy to you unrighteous [words] in my name; and I sent them not.
024	JER	036	010	For thus said the Lord; When seventy years shall be on the point of being accomplished at Babylon, I will visit you, and will confirm my words to you, to bring back your people to this place.
024	JER	036	011	And I will devise for you a device of peace, and not evil, to bestow upon you these [good things].
024	JER	036	012	And do ye pray to me, and I will hearken to you: and do ye earnestly seek me, and ye shall find me;
024	JER	036	013	for ye shall seek me with your whole heart.
024	JER	036	014	And I will appear to you:
024	JER	036	015	whereas ye said, The Lord has appointed for us prophets in Babylon:
024	JER	036	021	Thus saith the Lord concerning Achiab, and concerning Sedekias; Behold, I [will] deliver them into the hands of the king of Babylon; and he shall smite them in your sight.
024	JER	036	022	And they shall make of them a curse in all the captivity of Juda in Babylon, saying, The Lord do to thee as he did to Sedekias, and as he did to Achiab, whom the king of Babylon fried in the fire;
024	JER	036	023	because of the iniquity which they wrought in Israel, and [because] they committed adultery with the wives of their fellow-citizens; and spoke a word in my name, which I did not command them [to speak], and I am witness, saith the Lord.
024	JER	036	024	And to Samaeas the Aelamite thou shalt say,
024	JER	036	025	I sent thee not in my name: and to Sophonias the priest the son of Maasaeas say thou,
024	JER	036	026	The Lord has made thee priest in the place of Jodae the priest, to be ruler in the house of the Lord over every prophet, and to every madman, and thou shalt put them in prison, and into the dungeon.
024	JER	036	027	And now wherefore have ye reviled together Jeremias of Anathoth, who prophesied to you?
024	JER	036	028	Did he not send for this purpose? for in the course of this month he sent to you to Babylon, saying, It is far off: build ye houses, and inhabit [them]; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them.
024	JER	036	029	And Sophonias read the book in the ears of Jeremias.
024	JER	036	030	Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremias, saying,
024	JER	036	031	Send to the captivity, saying, Thus saith the Lord concerning Samaeas the Aelamite, Since Samaeas has prophesied to you, and I sent him not, and he has made you to trust in iniquity,
024	JER	036	032	therefore thus saith the Lord; Behold, I will visit Samaeas, and his family: and there shall not be a man of them in the midst of you to see the good which I will do to you: they shall not see [it].
024	JER	037	001	THE WORD THAT CAME TO JEREMIAS FROM THE LORD, SAYING,
024	JER	037	002	Thus speaks the Lord God of Israel, saying, Write all the words which I have spoken to thee in a book.
024	JER	037	003	For, behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will bring back the captivity of my people Israel and Juda, said the Lord: and I will bring them back to the land which I gave to their fathers, and they shall be lords of it.
024	JER	037	004	AND THESE ARE THE WORDS WHICH THE LORD SPOKE CONCERNING ISRAEL AND JUDA;
024	JER	037	005	Thus said the Lord: Ye shall hear a sound of fear, [there is] fear, and there is not peace.
024	JER	037	006	Enquire, and see if a male has born a child? and [ask] concerning the fear, wherein they shall hold their loins, and [look for] safety: for I have seen every man, and his hands are on his loins; [their] faces are turned to paleness.
024	JER	037	007	For that day is great, and there is not such [another]; and it is a time of straitness to Jacob; but he shall be saved out of it.
024	JER	037	008	In that day, said the Lord, I will break the yoke off their neck, and will burst their bonds, and they shall no longer serve strangers:
024	JER	037	009	but they shall serve the Lord their God; and I will raise up to them David their king.
024	JER	037	012	Thus saith the Lord; I have brought on [thee] destruction; thy stroke is painful.
024	JER	037	013	There is none to judge thy cause: thou hast been painfully treated for healing, there is no help for thee.
024	JER	037	014	All thy friends have forgotten thee; they shall not ask [about thee] at all, for I have smitten thee with he stroke of an enemy, [even] severe correction: thy sins have abounded above all thine iniquity.
024	JER	037	015	Thy sins have abounded beyond the multitude of thine iniquities, [therefore] they have done these things to thee. Therefore all that devour thee shall be eaten, and all thine enemies shall eat all their [own] flesh.
024	JER	037	016	And they that spoil thee shall become a spoil, and I will give up to be plundered all that have plundered thee.
024	JER	037	017	For I will bring about thy healing, I will heal thee of thy grievous wound, saith the Lord; for thou art called Dispersed: she is your prey, for no one seeks after her.
024	JER	037	018	Thus said the Lord; Behold, I will turn the captivity of Jacob, and will have pity upon his prisoners; and the city shall be built upon her hill, and the people shall settle after their manner.
024	JER	037	019	And there shall go forth from them singers, [even] the sound of men making merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not at all be diminished.
024	JER	037	020	And their sons shall go in as before, and their testimonies shall be established before me, and I will visit them that afflict them.
024	JER	037	021	And their mighty ones shall be over them, and their prince shall proceed of themselves; and I will gather them, and they shall return to me: for who is this that has set his heart to return to me? saith the Lord.
024	JER	037	023	For the wrathful anger of the lord has gone forth, [even] a whirlwind of anger has gone forth: it shall come upon the ungodly.
024	JER	037	024	The fierce anger of the Lord shall not return, until he shall execute [it], and until he shall establish the purpose of his heart: in the latter days ye shall know these things.
024	JER	038	001	At that time, saith the Lord, I will be a God to the family of Israel, and they shall be to me a people.
024	JER	038	002	Thus saith the Lord, I found him warm in the wilderness with them that were slain with the sword: go ye and destroy not Israel.
024	JER	038	003	The Lord appeared to him from afar, [saying], I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore have I drawn thee in compassion.
024	JER	038	004	For I will build thee, and thou shalt be built, O virgin of Israel: thou shalt yet take thy timbrel, and go forth with the party of them that make merry.
024	JER	038	005	For ye have planted vineyards on the mountains of Samaria: plant ye, and praise.
024	JER	038	006	For it is a day when those that plead on the mountains of Ephraim shall call, [saying], Arise ye, and go up to Sion to the Lord your God.
024	JER	038	007	For thus saith the Lord to Jacob; Rejoice ye, and exult over the head of the nations: make proclamation, and praise ye: say, The Lord has delivered his people, the remnant of Israel.
024	JER	038	008	Behold, I bring them from the north, and will gather them from the end of the earth to the feast of the passover: and [the people] shall beget a great multitude, and they shall return hither.
024	JER	038	009	They went forth with weeping, and I will bring them back with consolation, causing them to lodge by the channels of waters in a straight way, and they shall not err in it: for I am become a father to Israel, and Ephraim is my first-born.
024	JER	038	010	Hear the words of the Lord, ye nations, and proclaim [them] to the islands afar off; say, He that scattered Israel will also gather him, and keep him as one that feeds his flock.
024	JER	038	011	For the Lord has ransomed Jacob, he has rescued him out of the hand of them [that were] stronger than he.
024	JER	038	012	And they shall come, and shall rejoice in the mount of Sion, and shall come to the good things of the Lord, [even] to a land of corn, and wine, and fruits, and cattle, and sheep: and their soul shall be as a fruitful tree; and they shall hunger no more.
024	JER	038	013	Then shall the virgins rejoice in the assembly of youth, and the old men shall rejoice; and I will turn their mourning into joy, and will make them merry.
024	JER	038	014	I will expand and cheer with wine the soul of the priests the sons of Levi, and my people shall be satisfied with my good things: thus saith the Lord.
024	JER	038	015	A voice was heard in Rama, of lamentation, and of weeping, and wailing; Rachel would not cease weeping for her children, because they are not.
024	JER	038	016	Thus saith the Lord; Let thy voice cease from weeping, and thine eyes from thy tears: for their is a reward for thy works; and they shall return from the land of [thine] enemies.
024	JER	038	017	[There shall be] an abiding [home] for thy children.
024	JER	038	018	I have heard the sound of Ephraim lamenting, [and saying], Thou hast chastened me, and I was chastened; I as a calf was not [willingly] taught: turn thou me, and I shall turn; for thou [art] the Lord my God.
024	JER	038	019	For after my captivity I repented; and after I knew, I groaned for the day of shame, and shewed thee that I bore reproach from my youth.
024	JER	038	020	Ephraim is a beloved son, a pleasing child to me: for because my words are in him, I will surely remember him: therefore I made haste [to help] him; I will surely have mercy upon him, saith the Lord.
024	JER	038	021	Prepare thyself, O Sion; execute vengeance; look to thy ways: return, O virgin of Israel, by the way by which thou wentest, return mourning to thy cities.
024	JER	038	022	How long, O disgraced daughter, wilt thou turn away? for the Lord has created safety for a new plantation: men shall go about in safety.
024	JER	038	023	For thus saith the Lord; They shall yet speak this word in the land of Juda, and in the cities thereof, when I shall turn his captivity; blessed be the Lord on his righteous holy mountain!
024	JER	038	024	And there shall be dwellers in the cities of Juda, and in all his land, together with the husbandman, and [the shepherd] shall go forth with the flock.
024	JER	038	025	For I have saturated every thirsting soul, and filled every hungry soul.
024	JER	038	026	Therefore I awake, and beheld; and my sleep was sweet to me.
024	JER	038	027	Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Juda with the seed of man, and the seed of beast.
024	JER	038	028	And it shall come to pass, that as I watched over them, to pull down, and to afflict, so will I watch over them, to build, and to plant, saith the Lord.
024	JER	038	029	In those days they shall certainly not say, The fathers ate a sour grape, and the children's teeth were set on edge.
024	JER	038	030	But every one shall die in his own sin; and the teeth of him that eats the sour grape shall be set on edge.
024	JER	038	031	Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Juda:
024	JER	038	032	not according to the covenant which I made with their fathers in the day when I took hold of their hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; for they abode not in my covenant, and I disregarded them, saith the Lord.
024	JER	038	033	For this is my covenant which I will make with the house of Israel; after those days, saith the Lord, I will surely put my laws into their mind, and write them on their hearts; and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people.
024	JER	038	034	And they shall not at all teach every one his [fellow] citizen, and every one his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least of them to the greatest of them: for I will be merciful to their iniquities, and their sins I will remember no more.
024	JER	038	035	Thus saith the Lord, who gives the sun for a light by day, the moon and the stars for a light by night, and [makes] a roaring in the sea, so that the waves thereof roar; the Lord Almighty is his name:
024	JER	038	036	if these ordinances cease from before me, saith the Lord, then shall the family of Israel cease to be a nation before me forever.
024	JER	038	037	Though the sky should be raised to a [greater] height, saith the Lord, and though the ground of the earth should be sunk [lower] beneath, yet I will not cast off the family of Israel, saith the Lord, for all that they have done.
024	JER	038	038	Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when the city shall be built to the Lord from the tower of Anameel to the gate of the corner.
024	JER	038	039	And the measurement of it shall proceed in front of them as far as the hills of Gareb, and it shall be compassed with a circular wall of choice stones.
024	JER	038	040	And all the Asaremoth even to Nachal Kedron, as far as the corner of the horse-gate eastward, shall be holiness to the Lord; and it shall not fail any more, and shall not be destroyed for ever.
024	JER	039	001	The word that came from the Lord to Jeremias in the tenth year of king Sedekias, this is the eighteenth year of king Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon.
024	JER	039	002	And the host of the king of Babylon had made a rampart against Jerusalem: and Jeremias was kept in the court of the prison, which is in the king's house;
024	JER	039	003	in which king Sedekias [had] shut him up, saying, Wherefore dost thou prophesy, saying, Thus saith the Lord, Behold, I [will] give this city into the hands of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it;
024	JER	039	004	and Sedekias shall by no means be delivered out of the hand of the Chaldeans, for he shall certainly be given up into the hands of the king of Babylon, and his mouth shall speak to his mouth, and his eyes shall look upon his eyes;
024	JER	039	005	and Sedekias shall go into Babylon, and dwell there?
024	JER	039	006	AND THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO JEREMIAS, SAYING,
024	JER	039	007	Behold, Anameel the son of Salom thy father's brother is coming to thee, saying, Buy thee my field that is in Anathoth: for thou [hast] the right to take [it] as a purchase.
024	JER	039	008	So Anameel the son of Salom my father's brother came to me into the court of the prison, and said, Buy thee my field that is in the land of Benjamin, in Anathoth: for thou [hast] a right to buy it, and thou art the elder. So I knew that it was the word of the Lord.
024	JER	039	009	And I bought the field of Anameel the son of my father's brother, and I weighed him seventeen shekels of silver.
024	JER	039	010	And I wrote [it] in a book, and sealed [it], and took the testimony of witnesses, and weighed the money in the balance.
024	JER	039	011	And I took the book of the purchase that was sealed;
024	JER	039	012	and I gave it to Baruch son of Nerias, son of Maasaeas, in the sight of Anameel my father's brother's son, and in the sight of the men that stood by and wrote in the book of the purchase, and in the sight of the Jews that were in the court of the prison.
024	JER	039	013	And I charged Baruch in their presence, saying, Thus saith the Lord Almighty;
024	JER	039	014	Take this book of the purchase, and the book that has been read; and thou shalt put it into an earthen vessel, that it may remain many days.
024	JER	039	015	For thus saith the Lord; There shall yet be bought fields and houses and vineyards in this land.
024	JER	039	016	And I prayed to the Lord after I had given the book of the purchase to Baruch the son of Nerias, saying,
024	JER	039	017	O [ever] living Lord! thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thy great power, and with thy high and lofty arm: nothing can be hidden from thee.
024	JER	039	018	Granting mercy to thousands, and recompensing the sins of the fathers into the bosoms of their children after them: the great, the strong God;
024	JER	039	019	the Lord of great counsel, and mighty in deeds, the great Almighty God, and Lord of great name: thine eyes are upon the ways of the children of men, to give to every one according to his way:
024	JER	039	020	who hast wrought signs and wonders in the land of Egypt even to this day, and in Israel, and among the inhabitants of the earth; and thou didst make for thyself a name, as at this day;
024	JER	039	021	and thou didst bring out thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, with a mighty hand, and with a high arm, and with great sights;
024	JER	039	022	and thou gavest them this land, which thou didst swear [to give] to their fathers, a land flowing with milk and honey;
024	JER	039	023	and they went in, and took it; but they hearkened not to thy voice, and walked not in thine ordinances; they did none of the things which thou didst command them, and they caused all these calamities to happen to them.
024	JER	039	024	Behold, a multitude is come against the city to take it; and the city is given into the hands of the Chaldeans that fight against it, by the power of the sword, and the famine: as thou hast spoken, so has it happened.
024	JER	039	025	And thou sayest to me, Buy thee the field for money; and I wrote a book, and sealed [it], and took the testimony of witnesses: and the city is given into the hands of the Chaldeans.
024	JER	039	026	And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
024	JER	039	027	I am the Lord, the God of all flesh: shall anything be hidden from me!
024	JER	039	028	Therefore thus saith the Lord God of Israel; This city shall certainly be delivered into the hands of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it:
024	JER	039	029	and the Chaldeans shall come to war against this city, and they shall burn this city with fire, and shall burn down the houses wherein they burnt incense on the roofs thereof to Baal, and poured drink-offerings to other gods, to provoke me.
024	JER	039	030	For the children of Israel and the children of Juda alone did evil in my sight from their youth.
024	JER	039	031	For this city was [obnoxious] to my anger and my wrath, from the day that they built it even to this day; that I should remove it from my presence,
024	JER	039	032	because of all the wickedness of the children of Israel and Juda, which they wrought to provoke me, they and their kings, and their princes, and their priests, and their prophets, the men of Juda, and the dwellers in Jerusalem.
024	JER	039	033	And they turned the back to me, and not the face: whereas I taught them early in the morning, but they hearkened no more to receive instructions.
024	JER	039	034	And they set their pollutions in the house, on which my name was called, by their uncleannesses.
024	JER	039	035	And they built to Baal the altars that are in the valley of the son of Ennom, to offer their sons and their daughters to king Moloch; which things I commanded them not, neither came it into my mind that they should do this abomination, to cause Juda to sin.
024	JER	039	036	And now thus has the Lord God of Israel said concerning this city, of which thou sayest, it shall be delivered into the hands of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by famine, and banishment.
024	JER	039	037	Behold, I [will] gather them out of every land, where I have scattered them in my anger, and my wrath, and great fury; and I will bring them back into this place, and will cause them to dwell safely:
024	JER	039	038	and they shall be to me a people, and I will be to them a god.
024	JER	039	039	And I will give them another way, and another heart, to fear me continually, and [that] for good to them and their children after them.
024	JER	039	040	And I will make with them an everlasting covenant, which I will by no means turn away from them, and I will put my fear into their heart, that they may not depart from me.
024	JER	039	041	And I will visit [them] to do them good, and I will plant them in this land in faithfulness, and with all my heart, and with all [my] soul.
024	JER	039	042	For thus saith the Lord; As I have brought upon this people all these great evils, so will I bring upon them all the good things which I pronounced upon them.
024	JER	039	043	And there shall yet be fields bought in the land, of which thou sayest, it shall be destitute of man and beast; and they are delivered into the hands of the Chaldeans.
024	JER	039	044	And they shall buy fields for money, and thou shalt write a book, and seal [it], and shalt take the testimony of witnesses in the land of Benjamin, and round about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Juda, and in the cities of the mountain, and in the cities of the plain, and in the cities of the south: for I will turn their captivity.
024	JER	040	001	And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias the second time, when he was yet bound in the court of the prison, saying,
024	JER	040	002	Thus saith the Lord, who made the earth and formed it, to establish it; the Lord is his name;
024	JER	040	003	Cry to me, and I will answer thee, and I will declare to thee great and mighty things, which thou knowest not.
024	JER	040	004	For thus saith the Lord concerning the houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the king of Juda, which have been pulled down for mounds and fortifications,
024	JER	040	005	to fight against the Chaldeans, and to fill it with the corpses of men, whom I smote in mine anger and my wrath, and turned away my face from them, for all their wickedness:
024	JER	040	006	Behold, I bring upon her healing and cure, and I will show [myself] to them, and will heal her, and make both peace and security.
024	JER	040	007	And I will turn the captivity of Juda, and the captivity of Israel, and will build them, even as before.
024	JER	040	008	And I will cleanse them from all their iniquities, whereby they have sinned against me, and will not remember their sins, whereby they have sinned against me, and revolted from me.
024	JER	040	009	And it shall be for joy and praise, and for glory to all the people of the earth, who shall hear all the good that I will do: and they shall fear and be provoked for all the good things and for all the peace which I will bring upon them.
024	JER	040	010	Thus saith the Lord; There shall yet be heard in this place, of which ye say, it is destitute of men and cattle, in the cities of Juda, and in the streets of Jerusalem, [the places] that have been made desolate for want of men and cattle,
024	JER	040	011	the voice of gladness, and the voice of joy, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the voice of men saying, Give thanks to the Lord Almighty: for the Lord is good; for his mercy [endures] fore ever: and they shall bring gifts into the house of the Lord; for I will turn all the captivity of that land as before, said the Lord.
024	JER	040	012	Thus saith the Lord of hosts; There shall yet be in this place, that is desert for want of man and beast, in all the cities thereof, resting-places for shepherds causing their flocks to lie down.
024	JER	040	013	In the cities of the hill country, and in the cities of the valley, and in the cities of the south, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the [cities] round about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Juda, flocks shall yet pass under the hand of him that numbers [them], saith the Lord.
024	JER	041	001	The word that came to Jeremias from the Lord (now Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, and all his army, and all the country of his dominion, were warring against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Juda,) saying,
024	JER	041	002	Thus has the Lord said; Go to Sedekias king of Juda, and thou shalt say to him, Thus has the Lord said, This city shall certainly be delivered into the hands of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it, and shall burn it with fire:
024	JER	041	003	and thou shalt not escape out of his hand, but shalt certainly be taken, and shalt be given into his hands; and thine eyes shall see his eyes, and thou shalt enter into Babylon.
024	JER	041	004	But hear the word of the Lord, O Sedekias king of Juda; Thus saith the Lord,
024	JER	041	005	Thou shalt die in peace: and as they wept for thy fathers that reigned before thee, they shall weep also for thee, [saying], Ah lord! and they shall lament for thee down to the grave: for I have spoken the word, said the Lord.
024	JER	041	006	And Jeremias spoke to king Sedekias all these words in Jerusalem.
024	JER	041	007	And the host of the king of Babylon warred against Jerusalem, and against the cities of Juda, and against Lachis, and against Azeca: for these strong cities were left among the cities of Juda.
024	JER	041	008	The word that came from the Lord to Jeremias, after king Sedekias had concluded a covenant with the people, to proclaim a release;
024	JER	041	009	That every one should set at liberty his servant, and every one has handmaid, the Hebrew man and Hebrew woman, that no man of Juda should be a bondman.
024	JER	041	010	Then all the nobles, and all the people who had entered into the covenant, [engaging] to set free every one his man-servant, and every one his maid, turned,
024	JER	041	011	and gave them over to be men-servants and maid-servants.
024	JER	041	012	And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias, saying,
024	JER	041	013	Thus saith the Lord; I made a covenant with your fathers in the day wherein I took them out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage, saying,
024	JER	041	014	When six years are accomplished, thou shalt set free thy brother the Hebrew, who shall be sold to thee: for he shall serve thee six years, and [then] thou shalt let him go free: but they hearkened not to me, and inclined not their ear.
024	JER	041	015	And this day they turned to do that which was right in my sight, to proclaim every one the release of his neighbour; and they had concluded a covenant before me, in the house whereon my name is called.
024	JER	041	016	But ye turned and profaned my name, to bring back every one his servant, and every one his handmaid, whom ye had sent forth free [and] at their own disposal, to be to you men-servants and maid-servants.
024	JER	041	017	Therefore thus said the Lord; Ye have not hearkened to me, to proclaim a release every one to his neighbour: behold, I proclaim a release to you, to the sword, and to the pestilence, and to the famine; and I will give you up to dispersion [among] all the kingdoms of the earth.
024	JER	041	018	And I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant, who have not kept my covenant, which they made before me, the calf which they prepared to sacrifice with it,
024	JER	041	019	the princes of Juda, and the men in power, and the priests, and the people;
024	JER	041	020	I will even give them to their enemies, and their carcases shall be food for the birds of the sky and for the wild beasts of the earth.
024	JER	041	021	And I will give Sedekias king of Judea, and their princes, into the hands of their enemies, and the host of the king of Babylon [shall come upon] them that run away from them.
024	JER	041	022	Behold, I [will] give command, saith the Lord, and will bring them back to this land; and they shall fight against it, and take it, and burn it with fire, and the cities of Juda; and I will make them desolate without inhabitants.
024	JER	042	001	THE WORD THAT CAME TO JEREMIAS from the Lord in the days of Joakim, king of Juda, saying,
024	JER	042	002	Go to the house of the Archabin, and thou shalt bring them to the house of the Lord, into one of the courts, and give them wine to drink.
024	JER	042	003	So I brought forth Jechonias the son of Jeremin the son of Chabasin, and his brethren, and his sons, and all the family of the Archabin;
024	JER	042	004	and I brought them into the house of the Lord, into the chamber of the sons of Joanan, the son of Ananias, the son of Godolias, a man of God, who dwells near the house of the princes that are over the house of Maasaeas the son of Selom, who kept the court.
024	JER	042	005	And I set before them a jar of wine, and cups, and I said, Drink ye wine.
024	JER	042	006	But they said, We will on no account drink wine, for our father Jonadab the son of Rechab commanded us, saying, Ye shall on no account drink wine, [neither] ye, nor your sons for ever:
024	JER	042	007	nor shall ye at all build houses, nor sow any seed, nor shall ye have a vineyard: for ye shall dwell in tents all your days; that ye may live many days upon the land, in which ye sojourn.
024	JER	042	008	And we hearkened to the voice of Jonadab our father, so as to drink no wine all our days, we, and our wives, and our sons, and our daughters;
024	JER	042	009	and so as to build no houses to dwell in: and we have had no vineyard, nor field, nor seed:
024	JER	042	010	but we have dwelt in tents, and have hearkened, and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us.
024	JER	042	011	And it came to pass, when Nabuchodonosor came up against the land, that we said we would come in; and we entered into Jerusalem, for fear of the host of the Chaldeans, and for fear of the host of the Assyrians: and we dwelt there.
024	JER	042	012	And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
024	JER	042	013	Thus saith the Lord, Go, and say to the men of Juda, and to them that dwell in Jerusalem, Will ye not receive correction to hearken to my words?
024	JER	042	014	The sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have kept the word which he commanded his children, that they should drink no wine; and they have not drunk [it]: but I spoke to you early, and ye hearkened not.
024	JER	042	015	And I sent to you my servants the prophets, saying, Turn ye every one from his evil way, and amend your practices, and go not after other gods to serve them, and ye shall dwell upon the land which I gave to you and to your fathers: but ye inclined not your ears, and hearkened not.
024	JER	042	016	But the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have kept the command of their father; but this people has not hearkened to me.
024	JER	042	017	Therefore thus saith the Lord; Behold, I [will] bring upon Juda and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evils which I pronounced against them.
024	JER	042	018	Therefore thus saith the Lord; Since the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have hearkened to the command of their father, to do as their father commanded them:
024	JER	042	019	there shall never be wanting a man of the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab to stand before my face while the earth remains.
024	JER	043	001	IN THE FOURTH YEAR OF JOAKIM son of Josias king of Juda, the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
024	JER	043	002	Take thee a roll of a book, and write upon it all the words which I spoke to thee against Jerusalem, and against Juda, and against all the nations, from the day when I spoke to thee, from the days of Josias king of Juda, even to this day.
024	JER	043	003	Perhaps the house of Juda will hear all the evils which I purpose to do to them; that they may turn from their evil way; and [so] I will be merciful to their iniquities and their sins.
024	JER	043	004	So Jeremias called Baruch the son of Nerias: and he wrote from the mouth of Jeremias all the words of the Lord, which he had spoken to him, on a roll of a book.
024	JER	043	005	And Jeremias commanded Baruch, saying, I am in prison; I cannot enter into the house of the Lord:
024	JER	043	006	so thou shalt read in this roll in the ears of the people in the house of the Lord, on the fast day; and in the ears of all Juda that come out of their cities, thou shalt read to them.
024	JER	043	007	Peradventure their supplication will come before the Lord, and they will turn from their evil way: for great is the wrath and the anger of the Lord, which he has pronounced against this people.
024	JER	043	008	And Baruch did according to all that Jeremias commanded him—reading in the book the words of the Lord in the Lord's house.
024	JER	043	009	And it came to pass in the eighth year of king Joakim, in the ninth month, all the people in Jerusalem, and the house of Juda, proclaimed a fast before the Lord.
024	JER	043	010	And Baruch read in the book the words of Jeremias in the house of the Lord, in the house of Gamarias son of Saphan the scribe, in the upper court, in the entrance of the new gate of the house of the Lord, and in the ears of all the people.
024	JER	043	011	And Michaeas the son of Gamarias the son of Saphan heard all the words of the Lord, out of the book.
024	JER	043	012	And he went down to the king's house, into the house of the scribe: and, behold, there were sitting there all the princes, Elisama the scribe, and Dalaeas the son of Selemias, and Jonathan the son of Acchobor, and Gamarias the son of Saphan, and Sedekias the son of Ananias, and all the princes.
024	JER	043	013	And Michaeas reported to them all the words which he had heard Baruch reading in the ears of the people.
024	JER	043	014	And all the princes sent to Baruch son of Nerias Judin the son of Nathanias, the son of Selemias, the son of Chusi, saying, Take in thine hand the roll in which thou readest in the ears of the people, and come. So Baruch took the roll, and went down to them.
024	JER	043	015	And they said to him, Read [it] again in our ears. And Baruch read [it].
024	JER	043	016	And it came to pass, when they [had] heard all the words, [that] they took counsel each with his neighbour, and said, Let us by all means tell the king all these words.
024	JER	043	017	And they asked Baruch, saying, Where didst thou write all these words?
024	JER	043	018	And Baruch said, Jeremias told me from his [own] mouth all these words, and I wrote them in a book.
024	JER	043	019	And they said to Baruch, Go, and hide, thou and Jeremias; let no man know where ye [are].
024	JER	043	020	And they went in to the king into the court, and gave the roll [to one] to keep in the house of Elisama; and they told the king all these words.
024	JER	043	021	And the king sent Judin to fetch the roll: and he took it out of the house of Elisama: and Judin read in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the princes who stood round the king.
024	JER	043	022	Now the king was sitting in the winter house: and [there was] a fire on the hearth before him.
024	JER	043	023	And it came to pass when Judin had read three or four leaves, he cut them off with a penknife, and cast [them] into the fire that was on the hearth, until the whole roll was consumed in the fire that was on the hearth.
024	JER	043	024	And the king and his servants that heard all these words sought not [the Lord], and rent not their garments.
024	JER	043	025	But Elnathan and Godolias suggested to the king that he should burn the roll.
024	JER	043	026	And the king commanded Jeremeel the king's son, and Saraeas the son of Esriel, to take Baruch and Jeremias: but they were hidden.
024	JER	043	027	Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremias, after the king had burnt the roll, [even] all the words which Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremias, saying,
024	JER	043	028	Again take thou another roll, and write all the words that were on the roll, which king Joakim has burnt.
024	JER	043	029	And thou shalt say, Thus saith the Lord; Thou hast burnt this roll, saying, Why hast thou written therein, saying, The king of Babylon shall certainly come in, and destroy this land, and man and cattle shall fail from off it?
024	JER	043	030	Therefore thus saith the Lord concerning Joakim king of Juda; He shall not have [a man] to sit on the throne of David: and his carcass shall be cast forth in the heat by day, and in the frost by night.
024	JER	043	031	And I will visit him, and his family, and his servants: and I will bring upon him, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the land of Juda, all the evils which I spoke of to them; and they hearkened not.
024	JER	043	032	And Baruch took another roll, and wrote upon it from the mouth of Jeremias all the words of the book which Joakim had burnt: and there were yet more words added to it like the former.
024	JER	044	001	And Sedekias the son of Josias reigned instead of Joakim, whom Nabuchodonosor appointed to reign over Juda.
024	JER	044	002	And he and his servants and the people of the land hearkened not to the words of the Lord, which he spoke by Jeremias.
024	JER	044	003	And king Sedekias sent Joachal son of Selemias and Sophonias the priest son of Maasaeas to Jeremias, saying, Pray now for us to the Lord.
024	JER	044	004	Now Jeremias came and went through the midst of the city: for they [had] not put him into the house of the prison.
024	JER	044	005	And the host of Pharao was come forth out of Egypt; and the Chaldeans heard the report of them, and they went up from Jerusalem.
024	JER	044	006	And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias, saying,
024	JER	044	007	Thus said the Lord; Thus shalt thou say to the king of Juda who sent to thee, to seek me; Behold, the army of Pharao which is come forth to help you: they shall return to the land of Egypt:
024	JER	044	008	and the Chaldeans themselves shall turn again, and fight against this city, and take it, and burn it with fire.
024	JER	044	009	For thus saith the Lord; Suppose not in your hearts, saying, The Chaldeans will certainly depart from us: for they shall not depart.
024	JER	044	010	And though ye should smite the whole host of the Chaldeans that fight against you, and there should be left a few wounded [men], these should rise up each in his place, and burn this city with fire.
024	JER	044	011	And it came to pass, when the host of the Chaldeans had gone up from Jerusalem for fear of the host of Pharao,
024	JER	044	012	that Jeremias went forth from Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin, to buy thence [a property] in the midst of the people.
024	JER	044	013	And he was in the gate of Benjamin, and [there was] there a man with whom he lodged, Saruia the son of Selemias, the son of Ananias; and he caught Jeremias, saying, Thou art fleeing to the Chaldeans.
024	JER	044	014	And he said, [It is] false; I do not flee to the Chaldeans. But he hearkened not to him; and Saruia caught Jeremias, and brought him to the princes.
024	JER	044	015	And the princes were very angry with Jeremias, and smote him, and sent him into the house of Jonathan the scribe: for they had made this a prison.
024	JER	044	016	So Jeremias came into the dungeon, and into the cells, and he remained there many days.
024	JER	044	017	Then Sedekias sent, and called him; and the king asked him secretly, saying, Is there a word from the Lord? and he said, There is: thou shalt be delivered into the hands of the king of Babylon.
024	JER	044	018	And Jeremias said to the king, Wherein have I wronged thee, or thy servants, or this people, that thou puttest me in prison?
024	JER	044	019	And where are your prophets who prophesied to you saying, The king of Babylon shall not come against this land?
024	JER	044	020	Now therefore, my lord the king, let my supplication come before thy face: and why dost thou send me back to the house of Jonathan the scribe? and let me not on any account die there.
024	JER	044	021	Then the king commanded, and they cast him into the prison, and gave him a loaf a day out of the place where they bake, until the bread failed out of the city. So Jeremias continued in the court of the prison.
024	JER	045	001	And Saphanias the son of Nathan, and Godolias the son of Paschor, and Joachal the son of Semelias, heard the words which Jeremias spoke to the people, saying,
024	JER	045	002	Thus saith the Lord; He that remains in this city shall die by the sword, and by the famine: but he that goes out to the Chaldeans shall live; and his soul shall be given him for a found treasure, and he shall live.
024	JER	045	003	For thus saith the Lord; This city shall certainly be delivered into the hands of the host of the king of Babylon, and they shall take it.
024	JER	045	004	And they said to the king, Let that man, we pray thee, be slain, for he weakens the hands of the fighting men that are left in the city, and the hands of all the people, speaking to them according to these words: for this man does not prophesy peace to this people, but evil.
024	JER	045	005	Then the king said, Behold, he is in your hands. For the king could not resist them.
024	JER	045	006	And they cast him into the dungeon of Melchias the king's son, which was in the court of the prison; and they let him down into the pit: and there was no water in the pit, but mire: and he was in the mire.
024	JER	045	007	And Abdemelech the Ethiopian heard, (now he was in the king's household,) that they [had] put Jeremias into the dungeon; and the king was in the gate of Benjamin:
024	JER	045	008	and he went forth to him, and spoke to the king and said,
024	JER	045	009	Thou hast done evil in what thou hast done to slay this man with hunger: for there is no more bread in the city.
024	JER	045	010	And the king commanded Abdemelech, saying, Take with thee hence thirty men, and bring him up out of the dungeon, that he die not.
024	JER	045	011	So Abdemelech took the men and went into the underground [part of the] king's house, and took thence old rags and old ropes, and threw them to Jeremias into the dungeon.
024	JER	045	012	And he said, Put these under the ropes. And Jeremias did so.
024	JER	045	013	And they drew him with the ropes, and lifted him out of the dungeon: and Jeremias remained in the court of the prison.
024	JER	045	014	Then the king sent, and called him to himself into the house of Aselisel, which was in the house of the Lord: and the king said to him, I will ask thee a question, and I pray thee hide nothing from me.
024	JER	045	015	And Jeremias said to the king, If I tell thee, wilt thou not certainly put me to death? and if I give thee counsel, thou wilt not at all hearken to me.
024	JER	045	016	And the king swore to him, saying, [As] the Lord lives who gave us this soul, I will not slay thee, neither will I give thee into the hands of these men.
024	JER	045	017	And Jeremias said to him, Thus saith the Lord; If thou wilt indeed go forth to the captains of the king of Babylon, thy soul shall live, and this city shall certainly not be burnt with fire; and thou shalt live, and thy house.
024	JER	045	018	But if thou wilt not go forth this city shall be delivered into the hands of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and thou shalt by no means escape.
024	JER	045	019	And the king said to Jeremias, I consider the Jews that have gone over to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hands, and they mock me.
024	JER	045	020	And Jeremias said, They shall in no wise deliver thee up. Hear the word of the Lord which I speak to thee; and it shall be better for thee, and thy soul shall live.
024	JER	045	021	But if thou wilt not go forth, this is the word which the Lord has shewn me.
024	JER	045	022	And, behold, all the women that are left in the house of the king of Juda were brought forth to the princes of the king of Babylon; and they said, The men who were at peace with thee have deceived thee, and will prevail against thee; and they shall cause thy foot to slide and fail, they have turned back from thee.
024	JER	045	023	And they shall bring forth thy wives and thy children to the Chaldeans: and thou shalt by no means escape, for thou shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon, and this city shall be burnt.
024	JER	045	024	Then the king said to him, Let no man know [any] of these words, and certainly thou shalt not die.
024	JER	045	025	And if the princes shall hear that I have spoken to thee, and they come to thee, and say to thee, Tell us, what said the king to thee? hide [it] not from us, and we will in no wise slay thee, and what said the king to thee?
024	JER	045	026	Then thou shalt say to them, I brought my supplication before the presence of the king, that he would not send me back into the house of Jonathan, that I should die there.
024	JER	045	027	And all the princes came to Jeremias, and asked him: and he told them according to all these words, which the king had commanded him. And they were silent, because the word of the Lord was not heard.
024	JER	045	028	And Jeremias remained in the court of the prison, until the time when Jerusalem was taken.
024	JER	046	001	And it came to pass in the ninth month of Sedekias king of Juda, [that] Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon came, and all his host, against Jerusalem, and they besieged it.
024	JER	046	002	And in the eleventh year of Sedekiass, in the fourth month, on the ninth day of the month, the city was broken [up].
024	JER	046	003	And all the leaders of the king of Babylon went in, and sat in the middle gate, Marganasar, and Samagoth, and Nabusachar, and Nabusaris, Nagargas, Naserrabamath, and the rest of the leaders of the king of Babylon,
024	JER	046	014	and they sent, and took Jeremias out of the court of the prison, and gave him [in charge] to Godolias the son of Achicam, the son of Saphan: and they brought him out, and he sat in the midst of the people.
024	JER	046	015	And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias in the court of the prison, saying,
024	JER	046	016	Go and say to Abdemelech the Ethiopian, Thus said the Lord God of Israel; Behold, I [will] bring my words upon this city for evil, and not for good.
024	JER	046	017	But I will save thee in that day, and I will by no means deliver thee into the hands of the men before whom thou art afraid.
024	JER	046	018	For I will surely save thee, and thou shalt by no means fall by the sword; and thou shalt find thy life, because thou didst trust in me, saith the Lord.
024	JER	047	001	The word that came from the Lord to Jeremias, after that Nabuzardan the captain of the guard had let him go out of Rama, when he had taken him in manacles in the midst of the captivity of Juda, [even] those who were carried to Babylon.
024	JER	047	002	And the chief captain of the guard took him, and said to him, The Lord thy God has pronounced all these evils upon this place:
024	JER	047	003	and the Lord has done it; because ye sinned against him, and hearkened not to his voice.
024	JER	047	004	Behold, I have loosed thee from the manacles that were upon thine hands. If it seem good to thee to go with me to Babylon, then will I set mine eyes upon thee.
024	JER	047	005	But if not, depart; return to Godolias the son of Achicam, the son of Saphan, whom the king of Babylon has appointed governor in the land of Juda, and dwell with him in the midst of the people in the land of Juda: to whatsoever places it seems good in thine eyes to go, do thou even go. And the captain of the guard made him presents, and let him go.
024	JER	047	006	And he came to Godolias to Massepha, and dwelt in the midst of his people that was left in the land.
024	JER	047	007	And all the leaders of the host that was in the country, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Godolias [governor] in the land, and they committed to him the men and their wives, whom [Nabuchodonosor had] not removed to Babylon.
024	JER	047	008	And there came to Godolias to Massepha Ismael the son of Nathanias, and Joanan son of Caree, and Saraeas the son of Thanaemeth, and the sons of Jophe the Netophathite, and Ezonias son of the Mochathite, they and their men.
024	JER	047	009	And Godolias swore to them and to their men, saying, Be not afraid before the children of the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be better for you.
024	JER	047	010	And, behold, I dwell in your presence at Massepha, to stand before the Chaldeans who shall come against you: and do ye gather grapes, and fruits, and oil, and put [them] into your vessels, and dwell in the cities which ye have obtained possession of.
024	JER	047	011	And all the Jews that were in Moab, and among the children of Ammon, and those [that were] in Idumea, and those [that were] in all [the rest of] the country, heard that the king of Babylon [had] granted a remnant to Juda, and that he had appointed over them Godolias the son of Achicam.
024	JER	047	012	And they came to Godolias into the land of Juda, to Massepha, and gathered grapes, and very much summer fruit, and oil.
024	JER	047	013	And Joanan the son of Caree, and all the leaders of the host, who were in the fields, came to Godolias to Massepha,
024	JER	047	014	and said to him, Dost thou indeed know that king Beleissa son of Ammon has sent Ismael to thee to slay thee? But Godolias believed them not.
024	JER	047	015	And Joanan said to Godolias secretly in Massepha, I will go now and smite Ismael, and let no man know [it]; lest he slay thee, and all the Jews that are gathered to thee be dispersed, and the remnant of Juda perish.
024	JER	047	016	But Godolias said to Joanan, Do not the thing, for thou speakest lies concerning Ismael.
024	JER	048	001	Now it came to pass in the seventh month that Ismael the son of Nathanias the son of Eleasa of the seed royal, came, and ten men with him, to Godolias to Massepha: and they ate bread there together.
024	JER	048	002	And Ismael rose up, and the ten men that were with him, and smote Godolias, whom the king of Babylon had appointed [governor] over the land,
024	JER	048	003	and all the Jews that were with him in Massepha, and all the Chaldeans that were found there.
024	JER	048	004	And it came to pass on the second day after he had smitten Godolias, and no man knew [of it],
024	JER	048	005	that there came men from Sychem, and from Salem, and from Samaria, [even] eighty men, having their beards shaven, and their clothes rent, and beating their breasts, and [they had] manna and frankincense in their hands, to bring [them] into the house of the Lord.
024	JER	048	006	And Ismael went out to meet them; [and] they went on and wept: and he said to them, Come in to Godolias.
024	JER	048	007	And it came to pass, when they had entered into the midst of the city, [that] he slew them [and cast them] into a pit.
024	JER	048	008	But ten men were found there, and they said to Ismael, Slay us not: for we have treasures in the field, wheat and barley, honey and oil. So he passed by, and slew them not in the midst of their brethren.
024	JER	048	009	Now the pit into which Ismael cast all whom he smote, is the great pit, which king Asa had made for fear of Baasa king of Israel: [even] this Ismael filled with slain men.
024	JER	048	010	And Ismael brought back all the people that were left in Massepha, and the king's daughter, whom the captain of the guard had committed in charge to Godolias the son of Achicam: and he went away beyond the children of Ammon.
024	JER	048	011	And Joanan the son of Caree, and all the leaders of the host that were with him, heard of all the evil deeds which Ismael had done.
024	JER	048	012	And they brought all their army, and went to fight against him, and found him near much water in Gabaon.
024	JER	048	013	And it came to pass, when all the people that was with Ismael saw Joanan, and the leaders of the host that was with him,
024	JER	048	014	that they returned to Joanan.
024	JER	048	015	But Ismael escaped with eight men and went to the children of Ammon.
024	JER	048	016	And Joanan, and all the leaders of the host that were with him, took all the remnant of the people, whom he [had] brought back from Ismael, mighty men in war, and the women, and the other [property], and the eunuchs, whom they [had] brought back from Gabaon:
024	JER	048	017	and they departed, and dwelt in Gaberoch-amaa, that is by Bethleem, to go into Egypt, for fear of the Chaldeans:
024	JER	048	018	for they were afraid of them, because Ismael had smitten Godolias, whom the king of Babylon made [governor] in the land.
024	JER	049	001	Then came all the leaders of the host, and Joanan, and Azarias the son of Maasaeas, and all the people great and small,
024	JER	049	002	to Jeremias the prophet, and said to him, Let now our supplication come before thy face, and pray thou to the Lord thy God for this remnant; for we are left few out of many, as thine eyes see.
024	JER	049	003	And let the Lord thy God declare to us the way wherein we should walk, and the thing which we should do.
024	JER	049	004	And Jeremias said to them, I have heard [you]; behold, I will pray for you to the Lord our God, according to your words; and it shall come to pass, [that] whatsoever word the Lord God shall answer, I will declare [it] to you; I will not hide anything from you.
024	JER	049	005	And they said to Jeremias, Let the Lord be between us for a just and faithful witness, if we do not according to every word which the Lord shall send to us.
024	JER	049	006	And whether [it be] good, or whether [it be] evil, we will hearken to the voice of the Lord our God, to whom we send thee; that it may be well with us, because we shall hearken to the voice of the Lord our God.
024	JER	049	007	And it came to pass after ten days, [that] the word of the Lord came to Jeremias.
024	JER	049	008	And he called Joanan, and the leaders of the host, and all the people from the least even to the greatest,
024	JER	049	009	and he said to them, Thus saith the Lord;
024	JER	049	010	If ye will indeed dwell in this land, I will build you, and will not pull [you] down, but will plant you, and in no wise pluck you up: for I have ceased from the calamities which I brought upon you.
024	JER	049	011	Be not afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom ye are afraid; be not afraid of him, saith the Lord: for I am with you, to deliver you, and save you out of their hand.
024	JER	049	012	And I will grant you mercy, and pity you, and will restore you to your land.
024	JER	049	013	But if ye say, We will not dwell in this land, that we may not hearken to the voice of the Lord;
024	JER	049	014	for we will go into the land of Egypt, and we shall see no war, and shall not hear the sound of a trumpet, and we shall not hunger for bread; and there we will dwell:
024	JER	049	015	then hear the word of the Lord; thus saith the Lord;
024	JER	049	016	If ye set your face toward Egypt, and go in there to dwell; then it shall be, [that] the sword which ye fear shall find you in the land of Egypt, and the famine to which ye have regard, shall overtake you, [coming] after you in Egypt; and there ye shall die.
024	JER	049	017	And all the men, and all the strangers who have set their face toward the land of Egypt to dwell there, shall be consumed by the sword, and by the famine: and there shall not one of them escape from the evils which I bring upon them.
024	JER	049	018	For thus saith the Lord; As my wrath has dropped upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so shall my wrath drop upon you, when ye have entered into Egypt: and ye shall be a desolation, and under the power of others, and a curse and a reproach: and ye shall no more see this place.
024	JER	049	019	[These are the words] which the Lord has spoken concerning you the remnant of Juda; Enter ye not into Egypt: and now know ye for a certainty,
024	JER	049	020	that ye have wrought wickedness in your hearts, when ye sent me, saying, Pray thou for us to the Lord; and according to all that the Lord shall speak to thee we will do.
024	JER	049	021	And ye have not hearkened to the voice of the Lord, with which he sent me to you.
024	JER	049	022	Now therefore ye shall perish by sword and by famine, in the place which ye desire to go into to dwell there.
024	JER	050	001	And it came to pass, when Jeremias ceased speaking to the people all the words of the Lord, [for] which the Lord had sent him to them, [even] all these words,
024	JER	050	002	that Azarias son of Maasaeas spoke, and Joanan, the son of Caree, and all the men who had spoken to Jeremias, saying, [It is] false: the Lord has not sent thee to us, saying, Enter not into Egypt to dwell there:
024	JER	050	003	but Baruch the son of Nerias sets thee against us, that thou mayest deliver us into the hands of the Chaldeans, to kill us, and that we should be carried away captives to Babylon.
024	JER	050	004	So Joanan, and all the leaders of the host, and all the people, refused to hearken to the voice of the Lord, to dwell in the land of Juda.
024	JER	050	005	And Joanan, and all the leaders of the host, took all the remnant of Juda, who had returned to dwell in the land;
024	JER	050	006	the mighty men, and the women, and the children that were left, and the daughters of the king, and the souls which Nabuzardan had left with Godolias the son of Achicam and Jeremias the prophet, and Baruch the son of Nerias.
024	JER	050	007	And they came into Egypt: for they hearkened not to the voice of the Lord: and they entered into Taphnas.
024	JER	050	008	And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias in Taphnas, saying,
024	JER	050	009	Take thee great stones, and hide them in the entrance, at the gate of the house of Pharao in Taphnas, in the sight of the men of Juda:
024	JER	050	010	and thou shalt say, Thus has the Lord said; Behold, I [will] send, and will bring Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, and he shall place his throne upon these stones which thou hast hidden, and he shall lift up weapons against them.
024	JER	050	011	And he shall enter in, and smite the land of Egypt, [delivering] some for death to death; and some for captivity to captivity; and some for the sword to the sword.
024	JER	050	012	And he shall kindle a fire in the houses of their gods, and shall burn them, and shall carry them away captives: and shall search the land of Egypt, as a shepherd searches his garment; and he shall go forth in peace.
024	JER	050	013	And he shall break to pieces the pillars of Heliopolis that are in On, and shall burn their houses with fire.
024	JER	051	001	THE WORD THAT CAME TO JEREMIAS for all the Jews dwelling in the land of Egypt, and for those settled in Magdolo and in Taphnas, and in the land of Pathura, saying,
024	JER	051	002	Thus has the Lord God of Israel said; Ye have seen all the evils which I have brought upon Jerusalem, and upon the cities of Juda; and, behold, they are desolate without inhabitants,
024	JER	051	003	because of their wickedness, which they have wrought to provoke me, [by] going to burn incense to other gods, whom ye knew not.
024	JER	051	004	yet I sent to you my servants the prophets early in the morning, and I sent, saying, Do not ye this abominable thing which I hate.
024	JER	051	005	But they hearkened not to me, and inclined not their ear to turn from their wickedness, so as not to burn incense to strange gods.
024	JER	051	006	So mine anger and my wrath dropped [upon them], and was kindled in the gates of Juda, and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they became a desolation and a waste, as at this day.
024	JER	051	007	And now thus has the Lord Almighty said, Wherefore do ye commit [these] great evils against your souls? to cut off man and woman of you, infant and suckling from the midst of Juda, to the end that not one of you should be left;
024	JER	051	008	by provoking me with the works of your hands, to burn incense to other gods in the land of Egypt, into which ye entered to dwell there, that ye might be cut off, and that ye might become a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth?
024	JER	051	009	Have ye forgotten the sins of your fathers, and the sins of the kings of Juda, and the sins of your princes, and the sins of your wives, which they wrought in the land of Juda, and in the streets of Jerusalem?
024	JER	051	010	And have not ceased even to this day, and they have not kept to my ordinances, which I set before their fathers.
024	JER	051	011	Therefore thus saith the Lord; Behold I do set my face against [you]
024	JER	051	012	to destroy all the remnant that are in Egypt; and they shall fall by the sword, and by famine, and shall be consumed small and great: and they shall be for reproach, and for destruction, and for a curse.
024	JER	051	013	And I will visit them that dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have visited Jerusalem, with sword and with famine:
024	JER	051	014	and there shall not one be preserved of the remnant of Juda that sojourn in the land of Egypt, to return to the land of Juda, to which they hope in their hearts to return: they shall not return, but only they that escape.
024	JER	051	015	Then all the men that knew that their wives burned incense, and all the women, a great multitude, and all the people that dwelt in the land of Egypt, in Pathura, answered Jeremias, saying,
024	JER	051	016	[As for] the word which thou hast spoken to us in the name of the Lord, we will not hearken to thee.
024	JER	051	017	For we will surely perform every word that shall proceed out of our mouth, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour drink-offerings to her, as we and our fathers have done, and our kings and princes, in the cities of Juda, and in the streets of Jerusalem: and [so] we were filled with bread, and were well, and saw no evils.
024	JER	051	018	But since we left off to burn incense to the queen of heaven, we have all been brought low, and have been consumed by sword and by famine.
024	JER	051	019	And whereas we burned incense to the queen of heaven, and poured drink-offerings to her, did we make cakes to her, and pour drink-offerings to her, without our husbands?
024	JER	051	020	Then Jeremias answered all the people, the mighty men, and the women, and all the people that returned him [these] words for answer, saying,
024	JER	051	021	Did not the Lord remember the incense which ye burned in the cities of Juda, and in the streets of Jerusalem, ye, and your fathers, and your kings, and your princes, and the people of the land? and came it not into his heart?
024	JER	051	022	And the Lord could no longer bear [you], because of the wickedness of your doings, and because of your abominations which ye wrought; and so your land became a desolation and a waste, and a curse, as at this day;
024	JER	051	023	because of your burning incense, and [because] of the things wherein ye sinned against the Lord: and ye have not hearkened to the voice of the Lord, and have not walked in his ordinances, and in his law, and in his testimonies; and so these evils have come upon you.
024	JER	051	024	And Jeremias said to the people, and to the women, Hear ye the word of the Lord.
024	JER	051	025	Thus has the Lord God of Israel said; Ye women have spoken with your mouth, and ye fulfilled [it] with your hands, saying, We will surely perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour drink-offerings to her: full well did ye keep to your vows, and ye have indeed performed [them].
024	JER	051	026	Therefore hear ye the word of the Lord, all Jews dwelling in the land of Egypt; Behold, I have sworn by my great name, saith the Lord, my name shall no longer be in the mouth of every Jew to say, The Lord lives, in all the land of Egypt.
024	JER	051	027	For I have watched over them, to hurt them, and not to do them good: and all the Jews dwelling in the land of Egypt shall perish by sword and by famine, until they are utterly consumed.
024	JER	051	028	And they that escape the sword shall return to the land of Juda few in number, and the remnant of Juda, who have continued in the land [of] Egypt to dwell there, shall know whose word shall stand.
024	JER	051	029	And this [shall be] a sign to you, that I will visit you for evil.
024	JER	051	030	Thus said the Lord; Behold, I [will] give Uaphres king of Egypt into the hands of his enemy, and into the hands of one that seeks his life; as I gave Sedekias king of Juda into the hands of Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, his enemy, and who sought his life.
024	JER	051	031	THE WORD WHICH JEREMIAS THE PROPHET spoke to Baruch son of Nerias, when he wrote these words in the book from the mouth of Jeremias, in the fourth year of Joakim the son of Josias king of Juda.
024	JER	051	032	Thus has the Lord said to thee, O Baruch.
024	JER	051	033	Whereas thou hast said, Alas! alas! for the Lord has laid a grievous trouble upon me; I lay down in groaning, I found no rest;
024	JER	051	034	say thou to him, Thus saith the Lord; Behold, I pull down those whom I have built up, and I pluck up those whom I have planted.
024	JER	051	035	And wilt thou seek great things for thyself? seek [them] not: for, behold, I bring evil upon all flesh, saith the Lord: but I will give [to thee] thy life for a spoil in every place whither thou shalt go.
024	JER	052	001	It was the twenty-first year of Sedekias, when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Amitaal, the daughter of Jeremias, of Lobena.
024	JER	052	004	And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the ninth month, on the tenth day of the month, [that] Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon came, and all his host, against Jerusalem, and they made a rampart round it, and built a wall round about it with large stones.
024	JER	052	005	So the city was besieged, until the eleventh year of king Sedekias,
024	JER	052	006	on the ninth day of the month, and [then] the famine was severe in the city, and there was no bread for the people of the land.
024	JER	052	007	And the city was broken up, and all the men of war went out by night by the way of the gate, between the wall and the outworks, which were by the king's garden; and the Chaldeans were by the city round about; and they went by the way [leading] to the wilderness.
024	JER	052	008	But the host of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook him in the [country] beyond Jericho; and all his servants were dispersed from [about] him.
024	JER	052	009	And they took the king, and brought him to the king of Babylon to Deblatha, and he judged him.
024	JER	052	010	And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Sedekias before his eyes; and he slew all the princes of Juda in Deblatha.
024	JER	052	011	And he put out the eyes of Sedekias, and bound him in fetters; and the king of Babylon brought him to Babylon, and put him into the grinding-house, until the day when he died.
024	JER	052	012	And in the fifth month, on the tenth day of the month, Nabuzardan the captain of the guard, who waited on the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem;
024	JER	052	013	and he burnt the house of the Lord, and the king's house; and all the houses of the city, and every great house he burnt with fire.
024	JER	052	014	And the host of the Chaldeans that was with the captain of the guard pulled down all the wall of Jerusalem round about.
024	JER	052	016	But the captain of the guard left the remnant of the people to be vinedressers and husbandmen.
024	JER	052	017	And the Chaldeans broke in pieces the brazen pillars that were in the house of the Lord, and the bases, and the brazen sea that was in the house of the Lord, and they took the brass thereof, and carried it away to Babylon.
024	JER	052	018	Also the rim, and the bowls, and the flesh-hooks, and all the brazen vessels, wherewith they ministered;
024	JER	052	019	and the basons, and the snuffers, and the oil-funnels, and the candlesticks, and the censers, and the cups, the golden, of gold, and the silver, of silver, the captain of the guard took away.
024	JER	052	020	And the two pillars, and the one sea, and the twelve brazen oxen under the sea, which [things] king Solomon made for the house of the Lord; the brass of which [articles] was without weight.
024	JER	052	021	And as for the pillars, the height of one pillar was thirty-five cubits; and a line of twelve cubits compassed it round; and the thickness of it [all] round was four fingers.
024	JER	052	022	And [there was] a brazen chapiter upon them, and the length was five cubits, [even] the height of one chapiter; and [there were] on the chapiter round about network and pomegranates, all of brass: and correspondingly the second pillar [had] eight pomegranates to a cubit for the twelve cubits.
024	JER	052	023	And the pomegranates were ninety-six on a side; and all the pomegranates on the network round about were a hundred.
024	JER	052	024	And the captain of the guard took the chief priest, and the second priest, and those that kept the way;
024	JER	052	025	and one eunuch, who was over the men of war, and seven men of renown, who were in the king's presence that were found in the city; and the scribe of the forces, who did the part of a scribe to the people of the land; and sixty men of the people of the land, who were found in the midst of the city.
024	JER	052	026	And Nabuzardan the captain of the king's guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Deblatha.
024	JER	052	027	And the king of Babylon smote them in Deblatha, in the land of Aemath.
024	JER	052	031	And it came to pass in the thirty-seventh year after that Joakim king of Juda had been carried away captive, in the twelfth month, on the four and twentieth [day] of the month, [that] Ulaemadachar king of Babylon, in the year in which he began to reign, raised the head of Joakim king of Juda, and shaved him, and brought him out of the house where he was kept,
024	JER	052	032	and spoke kindly to him, and set his throne above the kings that were with him in Babylon,
024	JER	052	033	and changed his prison garments: and he ate bread continually before him all the days that he lived.
024	JER	052	034	And his appointed portion was given him continually by the king of Babylon from day to day, until the day when he died.

# BOOK	025	LAM	Lamentations	Lamentations
025	LAM	001	001	And it came to pass, after Israel was taken captive, and Jerusalem made desolate, [that] Jeremias sat weeping, and lamented [with] this lamentation over Jerusalem, and said, ALEPH. How does the city that was filled with people sit solitary! she is become as a widow: she that was magnified among the nations, [and] princess among the provinces, has become tributary.
025	LAM	001	002	BETH. She weeps sore in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks; and there is none of all her lovers to comfort her: all that were her friends have dealt deceitfully with her, they are become her enemies.
025	LAM	001	003	GIMEL. Judea is gone into captivity by reason of her affliction, and by reason of the abundance of her servitude: she dwells among the nations, she has not found rest: all her pursuers have overtaken her between her oppressors.
025	LAM	001	004	DALETH. The ways of Sion mourn, because there are none that come to the feast: all her gates are ruined: her priests groan, her virgins are led captive, and she is in bitterness in herself.
025	LAM	001	005	HE. Her oppressors are become the head, and her enemies have prospered; for the Lord has afflicted her because of the multitude of her sins: her young children are gone into captivity before the face of the oppressor.
025	LAM	001	006	VAU. And all her beauty has been taken away from the daughter of Sion: her princes were as rams finding no pasture, and are gone [away] in weakness before the face of the pursuer.
025	LAM	001	007	ZAIN. Jerusalem remembered the days of her affliction, and her rejection; [she thought on] all her desirable things which were from the days of old, when her people fell into the hands of the oppressor, and there was none to help her: when her enemies saw [it] they laughed at her habitation.
025	LAM	001	008	HETH. Jerusalem has sinned a [great] sin; therefore has she come into tribulation, all that used to honour her have afflicted her, for they have seen her shame: yea, she herself groaned, and turned backward.
025	LAM	001	009	TETH. Her uncleanness is before her feet; she remembered not her last end; she has lowered her boasting [tone], there is none to comfort her. Behold, O Lord, my affliction: for the enemy has magnified himself.
025	LAM	001	010	JOD. The oppressor has stretched out his hand on all her desirable things: for she has seen the Gentiles entering into her sanctuary, [concerning] whom thou didst command that they should not enter into thy congregation.
025	LAM	001	011	CHAPH. All her people groan, seeking bread: they have given their desirable things for meat, to restore their soul: behold, Lord, and look; for she is become dishonoured.
025	LAM	001	012	LAMED. All ye that pass by the way, turn, and see if there is sorrow like to my sorrow, which has happened [to me]. The Lord who spoke by me has afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger.
025	LAM	001	013	MEM. He has sent fire from his lofty habitation, he has brought it into my bones: he has spread a net for my feet, he has turned me back: he has made me desolate [and] mourning all the day.
025	LAM	001	014	NUN. He has watched over my sins, they are twined about my hands, they have come up on my neck: my strength has failed; for the Lord has laid pains on my hands, I shall not be able to stand.
025	LAM	001	015	SAMECH. The Lord has cut off all my strong men from the midst of me: he has summoned against me a time for crushing my choice men: the Lord has trodden a wine-press for the virgin daughter of Juda: for these things I weep.
025	LAM	001	016	AIN. Mine eye has poured out water, because he that should comfort me, that should restore my soul, has been removed far from me: my sons have been destroyed, because the enemy has prevailed.
025	LAM	001	017	PHE. Sion has spread out her hand, [and] there is none to comfort her: the Lord has commanded [concerning] Jacob, his oppressors are round about him: Jerusalem has become among them as a removed woman.
025	LAM	001	018	TSADE. The Lord is righteous; for I have provoked his mouth: hear, I pray you, all people, and behold my grief: my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity.
025	LAM	001	019	KOPH. I called my lovers, but they deceived me: my priests and my elders failed in the city; for they sought meat that they might restore their souls, and found [it] not.
025	LAM	001	020	RHECHS. Behold, O Lord; for I am afflicted: my belly is troubled, and my heart is turned within me; for I have been grievously rebellious: abroad the sword has bereaved me, even as death at home.
025	LAM	001	021	CHSEN. Hear, I pray you, for I groan: there is none to comfort me: all mine enemies have heard [of] mine afflictions, and rejoice because thou hast done [it]: thou hast brought on the day, thou hast called the time: they are become like to me.
025	LAM	001	022	THAU. Let all their wickedness come before thy face; and strip them, as they have made a gleaning for all my sins: for my groans are many, and my heart is grieved.
025	LAM	002	001	ALEPH. How has the Lord darkened in his wrath the daughter of Sion! he has cast down the glory of Israel from heaven to earth, and has not remembered his footstool.
025	LAM	002	002	BETH. In the day of his wrath the Lord has overwhelmed [her] as in the sea, [and] not spared: he has brought down in his fury all the beautiful things of Jacob; he has brought down to the ground the strong-holds of the daughter of Juda; he has profaned her kings and her princes.
025	LAM	002	003	GIMEL. He has broken in his fierce anger all the horn of Israel: he has turned back his right hand from the face of the enemy, and has kindled a flame in Jacob as a fire, and it has devoured all things round about.
025	LAM	002	004	DALETH. He has bent his bow as an opposing enemy: he has strengthened his right hand as an adversary, and has destroyed all the desirable things of my eyes in the tabernacle of the daughter of Sion: he has poured forth his anger as fire.
025	LAM	002	005	HE. The Lord is become as an enemy: he has overwhelmed Israel as in the sea, he has overwhelmed her palaces: he has destroyed her strong-holds, and has multiplied the afflicted and humbled ones to the daughter of Juda.
025	LAM	002	006	VAU. And he has scattered his tabernacle as a vine, he has marred his feast: the Lord has forgotten the feast and the sabbath which he appointed in Sion, and in the fury of his wrath has vexed the king, and priest, and prince.
025	LAM	002	007	ZAIN. The Lord has rejected his altar, he has cast off his sanctuary, he has broken by the hand of the enemy the wall of her palaces; they have uttered their voice in the house of the Lord as on a feast day.
025	LAM	002	008	HETH. And he has turned to destroy the wall of the daughter of Sion: he has stretched out the measuring line, he has not turned back his hand from afflicting [her]: therefore the bulwark mourned, and the wall was weakened with it.
025	LAM	002	009	TETH. Her gates are sunk into the ground: he has destroyed and broken to pieces her bars, [and] her king and her prince among the Gentiles: there is no law, nay, her prophets have seen no vision from the Lord.
025	LAM	002	010	JOD. The elders of the daughter of Sion have sat upon the ground, they have kept silence: they have cast up dust upon their heads; they have girded themselves with sackcloths: they have brought down to the ground the chief virgins in Jerusalem.
025	LAM	002	011	CHAPH. Mine eyes have failed with tears, my heart is troubled, my glory is cast down to the ground, for the destruction of the daughter of my people; while the infant and suckling swoon in the streets of the city.
025	LAM	002	012	LAMED. They said to their mothers, Where is corn and wine? while they fainted like wounded men in the streets of the city, while their souls were poured out into their mother's bosom.
025	LAM	002	013	MEM. What shall I testify to thee, or what shall I compare to thee, O daughter of Jerusalem? who shall save and comfort thee, O virgin daughter of Sion? for the cup of thy destruction is enlarged: who shall heal thee?
025	LAM	002	014	NUN. Thy prophets have seen for thee vanities and folly: and they have not discovered thine iniquity, to turn back thy captivity; but they have seen for thee vain burdens, and worthless visions.
025	LAM	002	015	SAMECH. All that go by the way have clapped their hands at thee; they have hissed and shaken their head at the daughter of Jerusalem. Is this the city, they say, the crown of joy of all the earth?
025	LAM	002	016	AIN. All thine enemies have opened their mouth against thee: they have hissed and gnashed their teeth, and said, We have swallowed her up: moreover this is the day which we looked for; we have found it, we have seen it.
025	LAM	002	017	PHE. The Lord has done that which he purposed; he has accomplished his word, [even] the things which he commanded from the ancient days: he has thrown down, and has not spared: and he has caused the enemy to rejoice over thee, he has exalted the horn of him that afflicted thee.
025	LAM	002	018	TSADE. Their heart cried to the Lord, Ye walls of Sion, pour down tears like torrents day and night: give thyself no rest; let not the apple of thine eyes cease.
025	LAM	002	019	KOPH. Arise, rejoice in the night at the beginning of thy watch: pour out thy heart as water before the face of the Lord; lift up thy hands to him for the life of thine infants, who faint for hunger at the top of all the streets.
025	LAM	002	020	RHECHS. Behold, O Lord, and see for whom thou has gathered thus. Shall the women eat the fruit of their womb? the cook has made a gathering: shall the infants sucking at the breasts be slain? wilt thou slay the priest and prophet in the sanctuary of the Lord?
025	LAM	002	021	CHSEN. The child and old man have lain down in the street: my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity: thou hast slain [them] with the sword and with famine; in the day of thy wrath thou hast mangled [them], thou has not spared.
025	LAM	002	022	THAU. He has called my sojourners round about to a solemn day, and there was not in the day of the wrath of the Lord any one that escaped or was left; whereas I have strengthened and multiplied all mine enemies.
025	LAM	003	001	ALEPH. I am the man that sees poverty, through the rod of his wrath upon me.
025	LAM	003	002	He has taken me, and led me away into darkness, and not [into] light.
025	LAM	003	003	Nay, against me has he turned his hand all the day.
025	LAM	003	004	He has made old my flesh and my skin; he has broken my bones.
025	LAM	003	005	BETH. He has built against me, and compassed my head, and brought travail [upon me].
025	LAM	003	006	He has set me in dark places, as them that have long been dead.
025	LAM	003	007	He has builded against me, and I cannot come forth: he has made my brazen [chain] heavy.
025	LAM	003	008	GIMEL. Yea, [though] I cry and shout, he shuts out my prayer.
025	LAM	003	009	DALETH. He has built up my ways, he has hedged my paths;
025	LAM	003	010	he has troubled me, [as] a she-bear lying in wait: he is to me [as] a lion in secret places.
025	LAM	003	011	He pursued [me] after I departed, and brought me to a stand: he has utterly ruined me.
025	LAM	003	012	HE. He has bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.
025	LAM	003	013	He has caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins.
025	LAM	003	014	I became a laughing-stock to all my people; and their song all the day.
025	LAM	003	015	VAU. He has filled me with bitterness, he has drenched me with gall.
025	LAM	003	016	And he has dashed out my teeth with gravel, he has fed me with ashes.
025	LAM	003	017	He has also removed my soul from peace: I forgot prosperity.
025	LAM	003	018	Therefore my success has perished, and my hope from the Lord.
025	LAM	003	019	ZAIN. I remembered by reason of my poverty, and because of persecution my bitterness and gall shall be remembered;
025	LAM	003	020	and my soul shall meditate with me.
025	LAM	003	021	This will I lay up in my heart, therefore I will endure.
025	LAM	003	022	HETH. [It is] the mercies of the Lord, that he has not failed me, because his compassions are not exhausted. Pity [us], O Lord, early [every] month: for we are not brought to an end, because his compassions are not exhausted.
025	LAM	003	023	[They are] new every morning: great is thy faithfulness.
025	LAM	003	024	The Lord is my portion, says my soul; therefore will I wait for him.
025	LAM	003	025	TETH. The Lord is good to them that wait for him: the soul which shall seek him
025	LAM	003	026	[is] good, and shall wait for, and quietly expect salvation of the Lord.
025	LAM	003	027	TETH. [It is] good for a man when he bears a yoke in his youth.
025	LAM	003	028	He will sit alone, and be silent, because he has borne [it] upon him.
025	LAM	003	030	JOD. He will give [his] cheek to him that smites him: he will be filled full with reproaches.
025	LAM	003	031	For the Lord will not reject for ever.
025	LAM	003	032	CHAPH. For he that has brought down will pity, and [that] according to the abundance of his mercy.
025	LAM	003	033	He has not answered [in anger] from his heart, though he has brought low the children of a man.
025	LAM	003	034	LAMED. To bring down under his feet all the prisoners of the earth,
025	LAM	003	035	to turn aside the judgment of a man before the face of the Most High,
025	LAM	003	036	to condemn a man [unjustly] in his judgment, the Lord has not given commandment.
025	LAM	003	037	Who has thus spoken, and it has come to pass? the Lord has not commanded it.
025	LAM	003	038	Out of the mouth of the Most High there shall not come forth evil and good.
025	LAM	003	039	MEM. Why should a living man complain, a man concerning his sin?
025	LAM	003	040	NUN. Our way has been searched out and examined, and we will turn to the Lord.
025	LAM	003	041	Let us lift up our hearts with [our] hand to the lofty One in heaven.
025	LAM	003	042	We have sinned, we have transgressed; and thou hast not pardoned.
025	LAM	003	043	SAMECH. Thou has visited [us] in wrath, and driven us away: thou has slain, thou has not pitied.
025	LAM	003	044	Thou hast veiled thyself with a cloud because of prayer, that I might be blind,
025	LAM	003	045	and be cast off. AIN. Thou hast set us [alone] in the midst of the nations.
025	LAM	003	046	All our enemies have opened their mouth against us.
025	LAM	003	047	Fear and wrath are come upon us, suspense and destruction.
025	LAM	003	048	Mine eye shall pour down torrents of water, for the destruction of the daughter of my people.
025	LAM	003	049	PHE. Mine eye is drowned [with tears], and I will not be silent, so that there shall be no rest,
025	LAM	003	050	until the Lord look down, and behold from heaven.
025	LAM	003	051	Mine eye shall prey upon my soul, because of all the daughters of the city.
025	LAM	003	052	TSADE. The fowlers chased me as a sparrow, all mine enemies destroyed my life in a pit without cause,
025	LAM	003	053	and laid a stone upon me.
025	LAM	003	054	Water flowed over my head: I said, I am cut off.
025	LAM	003	055	KOPH. I called upon thy name, O Lord, out of the lowest dungeon.
025	LAM	003	056	Thou heardest my voice: close not thine ears to my supplication.
025	LAM	003	057	Thou drewest nigh to my help: in the day wherein I called upon thee thou saidst to me, Fear not.
025	LAM	003	058	RECHS. O Lord, thou has pleaded the causes of my soul; thou has redeemed my life.
025	LAM	003	059	Thou hast seen, O Lord, my troubles: thou hast judged my cause.
025	LAM	003	060	Thou hast seen all their vengeance, [thou hast looked] on all their devices against me.
025	LAM	003	061	CHSEN. Thou hast heard their reproach [and] all their devices against me;
025	LAM	003	062	the lips of them that rose up against me, and their plots against me all the day;
025	LAM	003	063	their sitting down and their rising up: look thou upon their eyes.
025	LAM	003	064	Thou wilt render them a recompense, O Lord, according to the works of their hands.
025	LAM	003	065	THAU. Thou wilt give them [as] a covering, the grief of my heart.
025	LAM	003	066	Thou wilt persecute them in anger, and wilt consume them from under the heaven, O Lord.
025	LAM	004	001	ALEPH. How will the gold be tarnished, [and] the fine silver changed! the sacred stones have been poured forth at the top of all the streets.
025	LAM	004	002	BETH. The precious sons of Zion, who were equalled in value with gold, how are they counted as earthen vessels, the works of the hands of the potter!
025	LAM	004	003	GIMEL. Nay, serpents have drawn out the breasts, they give suck to their young, the daughters of my people are incurably cruel, as an ostrich in a desert.
025	LAM	004	004	DALETH. The tongue of the sucking child cleaves to the roof of its mouth for thirst: the little children ask for bread, [and] there is none to break [it] to them.
025	LAM	004	005	HE. They that feed on dainties are desolate in the streets: they that used to be nursed in scarlet have clothed themselves with dung.
025	LAM	004	006	VAU. And the iniquity of the daughter of my people has been increased beyond the iniquities of Sodoma, [the city] that was overthrown very suddenly, and none laboured against her [with their] hands.
025	LAM	004	007	ZAIN. Her Nazarites were made purer than snow, they were whiter than milk, they were purified [as] with fire, their polishing was superior to sapphire stone.
025	LAM	004	008	HETH. Their countenance is become blacker than smoke; they are not known in the streets: their skin has cleaved to their bones; they are withered, they are become as a stick.
025	LAM	004	009	TETH. The slain with the sword were better than they that were slain with hunger: they have departed, pierced through from [want of] the fruits of the field.
025	LAM	004	010	JOD. The hands of tender-hearted women have sodden their own children: they became meat for them in the destruction of the daughter of my people.
025	LAM	004	011	CHAPH. The Lord has accomplished his wrath; he has poured out fierce anger, and has kindled a fire in Sion, and it has devoured her foundations.
025	LAM	004	012	LAMED. The kings of the earth, [even] all that dwell in the world, believed not that an enemy and oppressor would enter through the gates of Jerusalem.
025	LAM	004	013	MEM. For the sins of her prophets, [and] iniquities of her priests, who shed righteous blood in the midst of her,
025	LAM	004	014	NUN. her watchmen staggered in the streets, they were defiled with blood in their weakness, they touched their raiment [with it].
025	LAM	004	015	SAMECH. Depart ye from the unclean ones: call ye them: depart, depart, touch [them] not: for they are on fire, yea, they stagger: say ye among the nations, They shall no more sojourn [there].
025	LAM	004	016	AIN. The presence of the Lord [was] their portion; [but] he will not again look upon them: they regarded not the person of the priests, they pitied not the prophets.
025	LAM	004	017	PHE. While we yet lived our eyes failed, while we looked in vain for our help. TSADE. We looked to a nation that could not save.
025	LAM	004	018	We have hunted [for] our little ones, that they should not walk in our streets. KOPH. Our time has drawn nigh, our days are fulfilled, our time is come.
025	LAM	004	019	Our pursuers were swifter than the eagles of the sky, they flew on the mountains, in the wilderness they laid wait for us.
025	LAM	004	020	RECHS. The breath of our nostrils, [our] anointed Lord, was taken in their destructive snares, of whom we said, In his shadow we shall live among the Gentiles.
025	LAM	004	021	CHSEN. Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Idumea, that dwellest in the land: yet the cup of the Lord shall pass through to thee: thou shalt be drunken, and pour forth.
025	LAM	004	022	THAU. O daughter of Sion, thine iniquity has come to an end; he shall no more carry thee captive: he has visited thine iniquities, O daughter of Edom; he has discovered thy sins.
025	LAM	005	001	Remember, O Lord, what has happened to us: behold, and look on our reproach.
025	LAM	005	002	Our inheritance has been turned away to aliens, our houses to strangers:
025	LAM	005	003	we are become orphans, we have no father, our mothers are as widows.
025	LAM	005	004	We have drunk our water for money; our wood is sold to us [for a burden] on our neck:
025	LAM	005	005	we have been persecuted, we have laboured, we have had no rest.
025	LAM	005	006	Egypt gave the hand [to us], Assur to their own satisfaction.
025	LAM	005	007	Our fathers sinned, [and] are not: we have borne their iniquities.
025	LAM	005	008	Servants have ruled over us: there is none to ransom [us] out of their hand.
025	LAM	005	009	We shall bring in our bread with [danger of] our lives, because of the sword of the wilderness.
025	LAM	005	010	Our skin is blackened like an oven; they are convulsed, because of the storms of famine.
025	LAM	005	011	They humbled the women in Sion, the virgins in the cities of Juda.
025	LAM	005	012	Princes were hanged up by their hands: the elders were not honoured.
025	LAM	005	013	The chosen men lifted up [the voice in] weeping, and the youths fainted under the wood.
025	LAM	005	014	And the elders ceased from the gate, the chosen men ceased from their music.
025	LAM	005	015	The joy of our heart has ceased; our dance is turned into mourning.
025	LAM	005	016	The crown has fallen [from] our head: yea, woe to us! for we have sinned.
025	LAM	005	017	For this has grief come; our heart is sorrowful: for this our eyes are darkened.
025	LAM	005	018	Over the mountain of Sion, because it is made desolate, foxes have walked therein.
025	LAM	005	019	But thou, O Lord, shalt dwell for ever; thy throne [shall endure] to generation and generation.
025	LAM	005	020	Wherefore wilt thou utterly forget us, and abandon us a long time?
025	LAM	005	021	Turn us, O Lord, to thee, and we shall be turned; and renew our days as before.
025	LAM	005	022	For thou hast indeed rejected us; thou hast been very wroth against us.

# BOOK	026	EZE	Ezekiel	Jezekiel
026	EZE	001	001	Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, on the fifth day of the month, that I was in the midst of the captivity by the river of Chobar; and the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.
026	EZE	001	002	On the fifth day of the month; this was the fifth year of the captivity of king Joakim.
026	EZE	001	003	And the word of the Lord came to Jezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans, by the river of Chobar; and the hand of the Lord was upon me.
026	EZE	001	004	And I looked, and, behold, a sweeping wind came from the north, and a great cloud on it, and [there was] brightness round about it, and gleaming fire, and in the midst of it as it were the appearance of amber in the midst of the fire, and brightness in it.
026	EZE	001	005	And in the midst as it were the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance; the likeness of a man was upon them.
026	EZE	001	006	And each one [had] four faces, and each one [had] four wings.
026	EZE	001	007	And their legs were straight; and their feet were winged, and [there were] sparks, like gleaming brass, and their wings were light.
026	EZE	001	008	And the hand of a man was under their wings on their four sides.
026	EZE	001	009	And the faces of them four turned not when they went; they went everyone straight forward.
026	EZE	001	010	And the likeness of their faces was the face of a man, and the face of a lion on the right of the four; and the face of a calf on the left of the four; and the face of an eagle to the four.
026	EZE	001	011	And the four had their wings spread out above; each one [had] two joined to one another, and two covered their bodies.
026	EZE	001	012	And each one went straight forward: wherever the spirit was going they went, and turned not back.
026	EZE	001	013	And in the midst of the living creatures [there was] an appearance as of burning coals of fire, as an appearance of lamps turning among the living creatures; and the brightness of fire, and out of the fire came forth lightning.
026	EZE	001	015	And I looked, and, behold, the four [had each] one wheel on the ground near the living creatures.
026	EZE	001	016	And the appearance of the wheels was as the appearance of beryl: and the four had one likeness: and their work was as it were a wheel in a wheel.
026	EZE	001	017	They went on their four sides: they turned not as they went;
026	EZE	001	018	neither did their backs [turn]: and they were high: and I beheld them, and the backs of them four were full of eyes round about.
026	EZE	001	019	And when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them: and when the living creatures lifted themselves off the earth, the wheels were lifted off.
026	EZE	001	020	Wherever the cloud happened to be, there was the spirit ready to go: the wheels went and were lifted up with them; because the spirit of life was in the wheels.
026	EZE	001	021	When those went, [the wheels] went; and when those stood, [the wheels] stood; and when those lifted themselves off the earth, they were lifted off with them: for the spirit of life was in the wheels.
026	EZE	001	022	And the likeness over the heads of the living creatures was as a firmament, as the appearance of crystal, spread out over their wings above.
026	EZE	001	023	And their wings were spread out under the firmament, reaching one to the other; two [wings] to each, covering their bodies.
026	EZE	001	024	And I heard the sound of their wings when they went, as the sound of much water: and when they stood, their wings were let down.
026	EZE	001	025	And lo! a voice from above the firmament
026	EZE	001	026	that was over their head, [there was] as the appearance of a sapphire stone, [and] the likeness of a throne upon it: and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as an appearance of a man above.
026	EZE	001	027	And I saw as it were the resemblance of amber from the appearance of the loins and upwards, and from the appearance of the loins and under I saw an appearance of fire, and the brightness thereof round about.
026	EZE	001	028	As the appearance of the bow when it is in the cloud in days of rain, so was the form of brightness round about.
026	EZE	002	001	This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord. And I saw and fell upon my face, and heard the voice of one speaking: and he said to me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak to thee.
026	EZE	002	002	And the Spirit came upon me, and took me up, and raised me, and set me on my feet: and I heard him speaking to me.
026	EZE	002	003	And he said to me, Son of Man, I send thee forth to the house of Israel, them that provoke me; who have provoked me, they and their fathers to this day.
026	EZE	002	004	And thou shalt say to them, Thus saith the Lord.
026	EZE	002	005	Whether then indeed they shall hear or fear, (for it is a provoking house,) yet they shall know that thou art a prophet in the midst of them.
026	EZE	002	006	And thou, son of man, fear them not, nor be dismayed at their face; (for they will madden and will rise up against thee round about, and thou dwellest in the midst of scorpions): be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their countenance, for it is a provoking house.
026	EZE	002	007	And thou shalt speak my words to them, whether they will hear or fear: for it is a provoking house.
026	EZE	002	008	And thou, son of man, hear him that speaks to thee; be not thou provoking, as the provoking house: open thy mouth, and eat what I give thee.
026	EZE	002	009	And I looked, and behold, a hand stretched out to me, and in it a volume of a book.
026	EZE	002	010	And he unrolled it before me: and in it the front and the back were written [upon]: and there was written [in it] Lamentation, and mournful song, and woe.
026	EZE	003	001	And he said to me, Son of Man, eat this volume, and go and speak to the children of Israel.
026	EZE	003	002	So he opened my mouth, and caused me to eat the volume. And he said to me, Son of man,
026	EZE	003	003	thy mouth shall eat, and thy belly shall be filled with this volume that is given to thee. So I ate it; and it was in my mouth as sweet as honey.
026	EZE	003	004	And he said to me, Son of man, go thy way, and go in to the house of Israel, and speak my words to them.
026	EZE	003	005	For thou art not sent to a people of hard speech, [but] to the house of Israel;
026	EZE	003	006	neither to many nations of other speech and other tongues, nor of harsh language, whose words thou wouldest not understand: although if I [had] sent thee to such, they would have hearkened to thee.
026	EZE	003	007	But the house of Israel will not be willing to hearken to thee; for they will not hearken to me: for all the house of Israel are stubborn and hard-hearted.
026	EZE	003	008	And, behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and I will strengthen thy power against their power.
026	EZE	003	009	And it shall be continually stronger than a rock: be not afraid of them, neither be dismayed at their faces, because it is a provoking house.
026	EZE	003	010	And he said to me, Son of man, receive into thine heart all the words that I have spoken to thee, and hear [them] with thine ears.
026	EZE	003	011	And go thy way, go in to the captivity, to the children of thy people, and thou shalt speak to them, and say to them, Thus saith the Lord; whether they will hear, [or] whether they will forbear.
026	EZE	003	012	Then the Spirit took me up, and I heard behind me the voice [as] of a great earthquake, [saying], Blessed [be] the glory of the Lord from his place.
026	EZE	003	013	And I perceived the sound of the wings of the living creatures clapping one to the other, and the sound of the wheels was near them, and the sound of the earthquake.
026	EZE	003	014	And the Spirit lifted me, and took me up, and I went in the impulse of my spirit; and the hand of the Lord was mighty upon me.
026	EZE	003	015	Then I passed through the air and came into the captivity, and went round [to] them that dwelt by the river of Chobar who were there; and I sat there seven days, conversant in the midst of them.
026	EZE	003	016	And after the seven days the word of the Lord came to me, saying, Son of man,
026	EZE	003	017	I have made thee a watchman to the house of Israel; and thou shalt hear a word of my mouth, and shalt threaten them from me.
026	EZE	003	018	When I say to the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou hast not warned him, to give warning to the wicked, to turn from his ways, that he should live; that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thy hand.
026	EZE	003	019	But if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, and from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity, and thou shalt deliver thy soul.
026	EZE	003	020	And when the righteous turns away from his righteousness, and commits a trespass, and I shall bring punishment before him, he shall die, because thou didst not warn him: he shall even die in his sins, because his righteousness shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thine hand.
026	EZE	003	021	But if thou warn the righteous not to sin, and he sin not, the righteous shall surely live, because thou hast warned him; and thou shalt deliver thine own soul.
026	EZE	003	022	And the hand of the Lord came upon me; and he said to me, Arise, and go forth into the plain, and there shalt thou be spoken to.
026	EZE	003	023	And I arose, and went forth to the plain: and, behold, the glory of the Lord stood there, according to the vision, and according to the glory of the Lord, which I saw by the river of Chobar: and I fell on my face.
026	EZE	003	024	Then the Spirit came upon me, and set me on my feet, and spoke to me, and said to me, Go in, and shut thyself up in the midst of thine house.
026	EZE	003	025	And thou, son of man, behold, bonds are prepared for thee, and they shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not come forth of the midst of them.
026	EZE	003	026	Also I will bind thy tongue, and thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover: because it is a provoking house.
026	EZE	003	027	But when I speak to thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say to them, Thus saith the Lord, He that hears, let him hear; and he that is disobedient, let him be disobedient: because it is a provoking house.
026	EZE	004	001	And thou, son of man, take thee a brick, and thou shalt set it before thy face, and shalt portray on it the city, [even] Jerusalem.
026	EZE	004	002	And thou shalt besiege it, and build works against it, and throw up a mound round about it, and pitch camps against it, and set up engines round about.
026	EZE	004	003	And take thou to thyself an iron pan, and thou shalt set it [for] an iron wall between thee and the city: and thou shalt set thy face against it, and it shall be in a siege, and thou shalt besiege it. This is a sign to the children of Israel.
026	EZE	004	004	And thou shalt lie upon thy left side, and lay the iniquities of the house of Israel upon it, according to the number of the hundred and fifty days [during] which thou shalt lie upon it: and thou shalt bear their iniquities.
026	EZE	004	005	For I have appointed thee their iniquities for a number of days, for a hundred and ninety days: so thou shalt bear the iniquities of the house of Israel.
026	EZE	004	006	And thou shalt accomplish this, and [then] shalt lie on thy right side, and shalt bear the iniquities of the house of Juda forty days: I have appointed thee a day for a year.
026	EZE	004	007	So thou shalt set thy face to the siege of Jerusalem, and shalt strengthen thine arm, and shalt prophesy against it.
026	EZE	004	008	And, behold, I have prepared bonds for thee, land thou mayest not turn from thy one side to the other, until the days of thy siege shall be accomplished.
026	EZE	004	009	Take thou also to thee wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentils, and millet, and bread-corn; and thou shalt cast them into one earthen vessel, and shalt make them into loaves for thyself; and thou shalt eat them a hundred and ninety days, according to the number of the days [during] which thou sleepest on thy side.
026	EZE	004	010	And thou shalt eat thy food by weight, twenty shekels a day: from time to time shalt thou eat them.
026	EZE	004	011	And thou shalt drink water by measure, even from time to time thou shalt drink the sixth part of a hin.
026	EZE	004	012	And thou shalt eat them [as] a barley cake: thou shalt bake them before their eyes in man's dung.
026	EZE	004	013	And thou shalt say, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel; Thus shall the children of Israel eat unclean things among the Gentiles.
026	EZE	004	014	Then I said, Not so, Lord God of Israel: surely my soul has not been defiled with uncleanness; nor have I eaten, that which died of itself or was torn of beasts from my birth until now; neither has any corrupt flesh entered into my mouth.
026	EZE	004	015	And he said to me, Behold, I have given thee dung of oxen instead of man's dung, and thou shalt prepare thy loaves upon it.
026	EZE	004	016	And he said to me, Son of man, behold, I break the support of bread in Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread by weight and in want; and shall drink water by measure, and in a state of ruin:
026	EZE	004	017	that they may want bread and water; and a man and his brother shall be brought to ruin, and they shall pine away in their iniquities.
026	EZE	005	001	And thou, son of man, take thee a sword sharper than a barber's razor; thou shalt procure it for thyself, and shalt bring it upon thine head, and upon thy beard: and thou shalt take a pair of scales, and shalt separate the hair.
026	EZE	005	002	A fourth part thou shalt burn in the fire in the midst of the city, at the fulfillment of the days of the siege: and thou shalt take a fourth part, and burn it up in the midst of it: and a fourth part thou shalt cut with a sword round about it: and a fourth part thou shalt scatter to the wind; and I will draw out a sword after them.
026	EZE	005	003	And thou shalt take thence a few in number, and shalt wrap them in the fold of thy garment.
026	EZE	005	004	And thou shalt take of these again, and cast them into the midst of the fire, and burn them up with fire: from thence shall come forth fire; and thou shalt say to the whole house of Israel,
026	EZE	005	005	Thus saith the Lord; This is Jerusalem: I have set her and the countries round about her in the midst of the nations.
026	EZE	005	006	And thou shalt declare mine ordinances to the lawless one from out of the nations; and my statutes [to the sinful one] of the countries round about her: because they have rejected mine ordinances, and have not walked in my statutes.
026	EZE	005	007	Therefore thus saith the Lord, Because your occasion [for sin has been taken] from the nations round about you, and ye have not walked in my statutes, nor kept mine ordinances, nay, ye have not even done according to the ordinances of the nations round about you; therefore thus saith the Lord;
026	EZE	005	008	Behold, I am against thee, and I will execute judgment in the midst of thee in the sight of the nations.
026	EZE	005	009	And I will do in thee things which I have not done, and the like of which I will not do again, for all thine abominations.
026	EZE	005	010	Therefore the fathers shall eat [their] children in the midst of thee, and children shall eat [their] fathers; and I will execute judgments in thee, and I will scatter all that are left of thee to every wind.
026	EZE	005	011	Therefore, [as] I live, saith the Lord; surely, because thou hast defiled my holy things with all thine abominations, I also will reject thee; mine eye shall not spare, and I will have no mercy.
026	EZE	005	012	A fourth part of thee shall be cut off by pestilence, and a fourth part of thee shall be consumed in the midst of thee with famine: and [as for another] fourth part of thee, I will scatter them to every wind; and a fourth part of thee shall fall by sword round about thee, and I will draw out a sword after them.
026	EZE	005	013	And my wrath and mine anger shall be accomplished upon them: and thou shalt know that I the Lord have spoken in my jealousy, when I have accomplished mine anger upon them.
026	EZE	005	014	And I will make thee desolate, and thy daughters round about thee, in the sight of every one that passes through.
026	EZE	005	015	And thou shalt be mourned over and miserable among the nations round about thee, when I have executed judgments in thee in the vengeance of my wrath. I the Lord have spoken.
026	EZE	005	016	And when I have sent against them shafts of famine, then they shall be consumed, and I will break the strength of thy bread.
026	EZE	005	017	So I will send forth against thee famine and evil beasts, and I will take vengeance upon thee; and pestilence and blood shall pass through upon thee; and I will bring a sword upon thee round about. I the Lord have spoken.
026	EZE	006	001	And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
026	EZE	006	002	Son of man, set thy face against the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them;
026	EZE	006	003	and thou shalt say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord; thus saith the Lord to the mountains, and to the hills, and to the valleys, and to the forests; Behold, I bring a sword upon you, and your high places shall be utterly destroyed.
026	EZE	006	004	And your altars shall be broken to pieces, and your consecrated plats; and I will cast down your slain [men] before your idols.
026	EZE	006	005	And I will scatter your bones round about your altars,
026	EZE	006	006	and in all your habitations: the cities shall be made desolate, and the high places utterly laid waste; that your altars may be destroyed, and your idols be broken to pieces, and your consecrated plats be abolished.
026	EZE	006	007	And slain [men] shall fall in the midst of you, and ye shall know that I am the Lord.
026	EZE	006	008	When there are [some] of you escaping from the sword among the Gentiles, and when ye are scattered in the countries;
026	EZE	006	009	then they of you that escape among the nations whither they were carried captive shall remember me; (I have sworn [an oath] against their heart that goes a-whoring from me, and their eyes that go a-whoring after their practices;) and they shall mourn over themselves for all their abominations.
026	EZE	006	010	And they shall know that I the Lord have spoken.
026	EZE	006	011	Thus saith the Lord; Clap with [thy] hand, and stamp with [thy] foot and say, Aha, aha! for all the abominations of the house of Israel: they shall fall by the sword, and by pestilence, and by famine.
026	EZE	006	012	He that is near shall fall by the sword; and he that is far off shall die by the pestilence; and he that is in the siege shall be consumed with famine: and I will accomplish mine anger upon them.
026	EZE	006	013	Then ye shall know that I am the Lord, when your slain are in the midst of your idols round about your altars, on every high hill, and under [every] shady tree, where they offered a sweet savour to all their idols.
026	EZE	006	014	And I will stretch out my hand against them, and I will make the land desolate and ruined from the wilderness of Deblatha, in all their habitations: [and] ye shall know that I am the Lord.
026	EZE	007	001	Moreover the word of the Lord came to me, saying, Also, thou, son of man, say,
026	EZE	007	002	Thus saith the Lord; An end is come to the land of Israel, the end is come on the four corners of the land.
026	EZE	007	003	The end is come on thee,
026	EZE	007	004	the inhabitant of the land: the time is come, the day has drawn nigh, not with tumult, nor with pangs.
026	EZE	007	005	Now I will pour out my anger upon thee near at hand, and I will accomplish my wrath on thee: and I will judge thee for thy ways, and recompense upon thee all thine abominations.
026	EZE	007	006	Mine eye shall not spare, nor will I have any mercy: for I will recompense thy ways upon thee, and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee; and thou shalt know that I am the Lord that smite [thee].
026	EZE	007	007	Now the end [is come] to thee, and I will send [judgment] upon thee: and I will take vengeance on thy ways, and will recompense all thine abominations upon thee.
026	EZE	007	008	Mine eye shall not spare, nor will I have any mercy: for I will recompense thy way upon thee, and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee; and thou shalt know that I am the Lord.
026	EZE	007	009	For thus saith the Lord; Behold, the end is come.
026	EZE	007	010	Behold, the day of the Lord! although the rod has blossomed,
026	EZE	007	011	pride has sprung up, and will break the staff of the wicked one, and [that] not with tumult, nor with haste.
026	EZE	007	012	The time is come, behold the day: let not the buyer rejoice, and let not the seller mourn.
026	EZE	007	013	For the buyer shall never again return to the seller, neither shall a man cleave with the eye [of hope] to his life.
026	EZE	007	014	Sound ye the trumpet, and pass sentence on all together.
026	EZE	007	015	[There shall be] war with the sword without, and famine and pestilence within: he that is in the field shall die by the sword; and famine and pestilence shall destroy them that are in the city.
026	EZE	007	016	But they that escape of them shall be delivered, and shall be upon the mountains: and I will slay all [the rest], every one for his iniquities.
026	EZE	007	017	All hands shall be completely weakened, and all thighs shall be defiled with moisture.
026	EZE	007	018	And they shall gird themselves with sackcloth, and amazement shall cover them; and shame shall be upon them, [even] upon every face, and baldness upon every head.
026	EZE	007	019	Their silver shall be cast forth in the streets, and their gold shall be despised: their souls shall not be satisfied, and their bellies shall not be filled: for it was the punishment of their iniquities.
026	EZE	007	020	[As for] their choice ornaments, they employed them for pride, and they made of them images of their abominations: therefore have I made them uncleanness to them.
026	EZE	007	021	And I will deliver them into the hands of strangers to make them a prey, and to the pests of the earth for a spoil; and they shall profane them.
026	EZE	007	022	And I will turn away my face from them, and they shall defile my charge, and shall go in to them unguardedly, and profane them.
026	EZE	007	023	And they shall work uncleanness: because the land is full of strange nations, and the city is full of iniquity.
026	EZE	007	024	And I will turn back the boasting of their strength; and their holy things shall be defiled.
026	EZE	007	025	And [though] propitiation shall come, and [one] shall seek peace, yet there shall be none.
026	EZE	007	026	There shall be woe upon woe, and there shall be message upon message; and a vision shall be sought from a prophet; but the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the elders.
026	EZE	007	027	The prince shall clothe himself with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be made feeble: I will do to them according to their ways, and according to their judgments will I punish them; and they shall know that I am the Lord.
026	EZE	008	001	And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the fifth month, on the fifth [day] of the month, I was sitting in the house, and the elders of Juda were sitting before me: and the hand of the Lord came upon me.
026	EZE	008	002	And I looked, and, behold, the likeness of a man: from his loins and downwards [there was] fire, and from his loins upwards [there was] as the appearance of amber.
026	EZE	008	003	And he stretched forth the likeness of a hand, and took me by the crown of my head; and the Spirit lifted me up between the earth and sky, and brought me to Jerusalem in a vision of God, to the porch of the gate that looks to the north, where was the pillar of the Purchaser.
026	EZE	008	004	And, behold, the glory of the Lord God of Israel was there, according to the vision which I saw in the plain.
026	EZE	008	005	And he said to me, Son of man, lift up thine eyes toward the north. So I lifted up mine eyes toward the north, and, behold, [I looked] from the north toward the eastern gate.
026	EZE	008	006	And he said to me, Son of man, hast thou seen what these do? They commit great abominations here so that I should keep away from my sanctuary: and thou shalt see yet greater iniquities.
026	EZE	008	007	And he brought me to the porch of the court.
026	EZE	008	008	And he said to me, Son of man, dig: so I dug, and behold a door.
026	EZE	008	009	And he said to me, Go in, and behold the iniquities which they practise here.
026	EZE	008	010	So I went in and looked; and beheld vain abominations, and all the idols of the house of Israel, portrayed upon them round about.
026	EZE	008	011	And seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel, and Jechonias the son of Saphan stood in their presence in the midst of them, and each one held his censer in his hand; and the smoke of the incense went up.
026	EZE	008	012	And he said to me, Thou hast seen, son of man, what the elders of the house of Israel do, each one of them in their secret chamber: because they have said, The Lord see not; The Lord has forsaken the earth.
026	EZE	008	013	And he said to me, Thou shalt see yet greater iniquities which these do.
026	EZE	008	014	And he brought me in to the porch of the house of the Lord that looks to the north; and, behold [there were] women sitting there lamenting for Thammuz.
026	EZE	008	015	And he said to me, Son of man, thou hast seen; but thou shalt yet see [evil] practices greater then these.
026	EZE	008	016	And he brought me into the inner court of the house of the Lord, and at the entrance of the temple of the Lord, between the porch and the altar, were about twenty men, with their back parts toward the temple of the Lord, and their faces [turned] the opposite way; and these were worshipping the sun.
026	EZE	008	017	And he said to me, Son of man, thou hast seen this. [Is it] a little thing to the house of Juda to practise the iniquities which they have practised here? for they have filled the land with iniquity: and, behold, these are as scorners.
026	EZE	008	018	Therefore will I deal with them in wrath: mine eye shall not spare, nor will I have any mercy.
026	EZE	009	001	And he cried in mine ears with a loud voice, saying, The judgment of the city has drawn nigh; and each had the weapons of destruction in his hand.
026	EZE	009	002	And, behold, six men came from the way of the high gate that looks toward the north, and each one's axe was in his hand; and there was one man in the midst of them clothed with a long robe down to the feet, and a sapphire girdle was on his loins: and they came in and stood near the brazen altar.
026	EZE	009	003	And the glory of the God of Israel, that was upon them, went up from the cherubs to the porch of the house. And he called the man that was clothed with the long robe, who had the girdle on his loins;
026	EZE	009	004	And said to him, Go through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark on the foreheads of the men that groan and that grieve for all the iniquities that are done in the midst of them.
026	EZE	009	005	And he said to the first in my hearing, Go after him into the city, and smite: and let not your eyes spare, and have no mercy.
026	EZE	009	006	Slay utterly old man and youth, and virgin, and infants, and women: but go ye not nigh any on whom is the mark: begin at my sanctuary. So they began with the elder men who were within in the house.
026	EZE	009	007	And he said to them, Defile the house, and go out and fill the ways with dead bodies, and smite.
026	EZE	009	008	And it came to pass as they were smiting, that I fell upon my face, and cried out, and said, Alas, O Lord! wilt thou destroy the remnant of Israel, in pouring out thy wrath upon Jerusalem?
026	EZE	009	009	Then said he to me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and Juda is become very exceedingly great: for the land is filled with many nations, and the city is filled with iniquity and uncleanness: because they have said, The Lord has forsaken the earth, The Lord looks not upon [it].
026	EZE	009	010	Therefore mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have any mercy: I have recompensed their ways upon their heads.
026	EZE	009	011	And, behold, the man clothed with the long robe, and girt with the girdle about his loins, answered and said, I have done as thou didst command me.
026	EZE	010	001	Then I looked, and, behold, over the firmament that was above the head of the cherubs [there was] a likeness of a throne over them, as a sapphire stone.
026	EZE	010	002	And he said to the man clothed with the [long] robe, Go in between the wheels that are under the cherubs, and fill thine hands with coals of fire from between the cherubs, and scatter [them] over the city. And he went in my sight.
026	EZE	010	003	And the cherubs stood on the right hand of the house, as the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court.
026	EZE	010	004	Then the glory of the Lord departed from the cherubs to the porch of the house; and the cloud filled the house, and the court was filled with the brightness of the glory of the Lord.
026	EZE	010	005	And the sound of the cherubs' wings was heard as far as the outer court, as the voice of the Almighty God speaking.
026	EZE	010	006	And it came to pass, when he gave a charge to the man clothed with the sacred robe, saying, Take fire from between the wheels from between the cherubs, that he went in, and stood near the wheels.
026	EZE	010	007	And he stretched forth his hand into the midst of the fire that was between the cherubs, and took [thereof], and put [it] into the hands of the man clothed with the sacred robe: and he took [it], and went out.
026	EZE	010	008	And I saw the cherubs [having] the likeness of men's hands under their wings.
026	EZE	010	009	And I saw, and behold, four wheels stood by the cherubs, one wheel by each cherub: and the appearance of the wheels was as the appearance of a carbuncle stone.
026	EZE	010	010	And [as for] their appearance, [there was] one likeness to the four, as if there should be a wheel in the midst of a wheel.
026	EZE	010	011	When they went, they went on their four sides; they turned not when they went, for whichever way the first head looked, they went; and they turned not as they went.
026	EZE	010	012	And their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes round about the four wheels.
026	EZE	010	013	And these wheels were called Gelgel in my hearing.
026	EZE	010	015	And the cherubs were the same living creature which I saw by the river of Chobar.
026	EZE	010	016	And when the cherubs went, the wheels went, and they were close to them: and when the cherubs lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, their wheels turned not.
026	EZE	010	017	When they stood, [the wheels] stood; and when they mounted up, [the wheels] mounted up with them: because the spirit of life was in them.
026	EZE	010	018	Then the glory of the Lord departed from the house, and went up on the cherubs.
026	EZE	010	019	And the cherubs lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight: when they went forth, the wheels were also beside them, and they stood at the entrance of the front gate of the house of the Lord; and the glory of the God of Israel was upon them above.
026	EZE	010	020	This is the living creature which I saw under the God of Israel by the river of Chobar; and I knew that they were cherubs.
026	EZE	010	021	Each one [had] four faces, and each one [had] eight wings; and under their wings was the likeness of men's hands.
026	EZE	010	022	And [as for] the likeness of their faces, these are the [same] faces which I saw under the glory of the God of Israel by the river of Chobar: and they went each straight forward.
026	EZE	011	001	Moreover the Spirit took me up, and brought me to the front gate of the house of the Lord, that looks eastward: and behold at the entrance of the gate were about five and twenty men; and I saw in the midst of them Jechonias the son of Ezer, and Phaltias the son of Banaeas, the leaders of the people.
026	EZE	011	002	And the Lord said to me, Son of man, these are the men that devise vanities, and take evil counsel in this city:
026	EZE	011	003	who say, Have not the houses been newly built? This is the caldron, and we are the flesh.
026	EZE	011	004	Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, son of man.
026	EZE	011	005	And the Spirit of the Lord fell upon me, and said to me, say; Thus saith the Lord; Thus have ye said, O house of Israel: and I know the devices of your spirit.
026	EZE	011	006	Ye have multiplied your dead in this city, and ye have filled your ways with slain men.
026	EZE	011	007	Therefore thus saith the Lord; Your dead whom ye have smitten in the midst of it, these are the flesh, and this[city] is the caldron: but I will bring you forth out of the midst of it.
026	EZE	011	008	Ye fear the sword; and I will bring a sword upon you, saith the Lord.
026	EZE	011	009	And I will bring you forth out of the midst of it, and will deliver you into the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among you.
026	EZE	011	010	Ye shall fall by the sword; I will judge you on the mountains of Israel; and ye shall know that I am the Lord.
026	EZE	011	011	And it came to pass, while I was prophesying, that Phaltias the son of Banaeas died. And I fell upon my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, Alas, alas, O Lord! wilt thou utterly destroy the remnant of Israel?
026	EZE	011	014	And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
026	EZE	011	015	Son of man, thy brethren, and the men of thy captivity, and all the house of Israel are come to the full, to whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem said, Keep ye far away from the Lord: the land is given to us for an inheritance.
026	EZE	011	016	Therefore say thou, Thus saith the Lord; I will cast them off among the nations, and will disperse them into every land, yet will I be to them for a little sanctuary in the countries which they shall enter.
026	EZE	011	017	Therefore say thou, Thus saith the Lord; I will also take them from the heathen, and gather them out of the lands wherein I have scattered them, and will give them the land of Israel.
026	EZE	011	018	And they shall enter in there, and shall remove all the abominations of it, and all its iniquities from it.
026	EZE	011	019	And I will give them another heart, and will put a new spirit within them; and will extract the heart of stone from their flesh, and give them a heart of flesh:
026	EZE	011	020	that they may walk in my commandments, and keep mine ordinances, and do them: and they shall be to me a people, and I will be to them a God.
026	EZE	011	021	And as for the heart [set upon] their abominations and their iniquities, as their heart went [after them], I have recompensed their ways on their heads, saith the Lord.
026	EZE	011	022	Then the cherubs lifted up their wings, and the wheels beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.
026	EZE	011	023	And the glory of the Lord went up from the midst of the city, and stood on the mountain which was in front of the city.
026	EZE	011	024	And the Spirit took me up, and brought me to the land of the Chaldeans, to the captivity, in a vision by the Spirit of God: and I went up after the vision which I saw.
026	EZE	011	025	And I spoke to the captivity all the words of the Lord which he had shewed me.
026	EZE	012	001	And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
026	EZE	012	002	Son of man, thou dwellest in the midst of the iniquities of those, who have eyes to see, and see not; and have ears to hear, and hear not: because it is a provoking house.
026	EZE	012	003	Thou therefore, son of man, prepare thyself baggage for going into captivity by day in their sight; and thou shalt be led into captivity from thy place into another place in their sight; that they may see that it is a provoking house.
026	EZE	012	004	And thou shalt carry forth thy baggage, baggage for captivity, by day before their eyes: and thou shalt go forth at even, as a captive goes forth, in their sight.
026	EZE	012	005	Dig for thyself into the wall [of the house], and thou shalt pass through it in their sight:
026	EZE	012	006	thou shalt be lifted up on [men's] shoulders, and shalt go forth in secret: thou shalt cover thy face, and shalt not see the ground: because I have made thee a sign to the house of Israel.
026	EZE	012	007	And I did thus according to all that he commanded me; and I carried forth my baggage for captivity by day, and in the evening I dug through the wall for myself, and went out secretly; I was taken up on [men's] shoulders before them.
026	EZE	012	008	And the word of the Lord came to me in the morning, saying,
026	EZE	012	009	Son of man, have not the house of Israel, the provoking house, said to thee, What doest thou?
026	EZE	012	010	Say to them, Thus saith the Lord God, the Prince and the Ruler in Israel, even to all the house of Israel who are in the midst of them:
026	EZE	012	011	say, I am performing signs: as I have done, so shall it be to him: they shall go into banishment and captivity.
026	EZE	012	012	And the prince in the midst of them shall be borne upon shoulders, and shall go forth in secret through the wall, and shall dig so that he may go forth thereby: he shall cover his face, that he may not be seen by [any] eye, and he himself shall not see the ground.
026	EZE	012	013	And I will spread out my net upon him, and he shall be caught in my toils: and I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans; but he shall not see it, though he shall die there.
026	EZE	012	014	And I will scatter to every wind all his assistants round about him, and all that help him; and I will draw out a sword after them;
026	EZE	012	015	And they shall know that I am the Lord, when I have scattered them among the nations; and I will disperse them in the countries.
026	EZE	012	016	And I will leave of them [a few] men in number [spared] from the sword, and from famine, and pestilence; that they may declare all their iniquities among the nations whither they have gone; and they shall know that I am the Lord.
026	EZE	012	017	And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
026	EZE	012	018	Son of man, eat thy bread with sorrow, and drink [thy] water with torment and affliction.
026	EZE	012	019	And thou shalt say to the people of the land, Thus saith the Lord to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, on the land of Israel; They shall eat their bread in scarcity, and shall drink their water in desolation, that the land may be desolate with all that it contains: for all that dwell in it are ungodly.
026	EZE	012	020	And their inhabited cities shall be laid utterly waste, and the land shall be desolate; and ye shall know that I am the Lord.
026	EZE	012	021	And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
026	EZE	012	022	Son of man, what is your parable on the land of Israel, that ye say, The days are long, the vision has perished?
026	EZE	012	023	Therefore say to them, Thus saith the Lord; I will even set aside this parable, and the house of Israel shall no more at all use this parable: for thou shalt say to them, The days are at hand, and the import of every vision.
026	EZE	012	024	For there shall no more be any false vision, nor any one prophesying flatteries in the midst of the children of Israel.
026	EZE	012	025	For I the Lord will speak my words; I will speak and perform [them], and will no more delay, for in your days, O provoking house, I will speak the word, and will perform [it], saith the Lord.
026	EZE	012	026	Moreover the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
026	EZE	012	027	Son of man, behold, the provoking house of Israel boldly say, The vision which this man sees is for many days, and he prophesies for times afar off.
026	EZE	012	028	Therefore say to them, Thus saith the Lord; Henceforth none of my words shall linger, which I shall speak: I will speak and do, saith the Lord.
026	EZE	013	001	And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
026	EZE	013	002	Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel, and thou shalt prophesy, and shalt say to them, Hear ye the word of the Lord:
026	EZE	013	003	Thus saith the Lord, Woe to them that prophesy out of their own heart, and who see nothing at all.
026	EZE	013	004	Thy prophets, O Israel, are like foxes in the deserts.
026	EZE	013	005	They have not continued steadfast, and they have gathered flocks against the house of Israel, they that say,
026	EZE	013	006	In the day of the Lord, have not stood, seeing false [visions], prophesying vanities, who say, The Lord saith, and the Lord has not sent them, and they began [to try] to confirm the word.
026	EZE	013	007	Have ye not seen a false vision? and spoken vain prophecies?
026	EZE	013	008	And therefore say, Thus saith the Lord; Because your words are false, and your prophecies are vain, therefore, behold, I am against you, saith the Lord.
026	EZE	013	009	And I will stretch forth my hand against the prophets that see false [visions], and those that utter vanities: they shall not partake of the instruction of my people, neither shall they be written in the roll of the house of Israel, and they shall not enter into the land of Israel; and they shall know that I am the Lord.
026	EZE	013	010	Because they have caused my people to err, saying, Peace; and there is no peace; and one builds a wall, and they plaster it, —it shall fall.
026	EZE	013	011	Say to them that plaster [it], It shall fall; and there shall be a flooding rain; and I will send great stones upon their joinings, and they shall fall; and there shall be a sweeping wind, and it shall be broken.
026	EZE	013	012	And lo! the wall has fallen; and will they not say to you, Where is your plaster wherewith ye plastered [it]?
026	EZE	013	013	Therefore thus saith the Lord; I will even cause to burst forth a sweeping blast with fury, and there shall be a flooding rain in my wrath; and in [my] fury I will bring on great stones for complete destruction.
026	EZE	013	014	And I will break down the wall which ye have plastered, and it shall fall; and I will lay it on the ground, and its foundations shall be discovered, and it shall fall; and ye shall be consumed with rebukes: and ye shall know that I am the Lord.
026	EZE	013	015	And I will accomplish my wrath upon the wall, and upon them that plaster it; it shall fall: and I said to you, The wall is not, nor they that plaster it,
026	EZE	013	016	even the prophets of Israel, who prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and who see [visions of] peace for her, and there is no peace, saith the Lord.
026	EZE	013	017	And thou, son of man, set thy face firmly against the daughters of thy people, that prophesy out of their own heart; and prophesy against them.
026	EZE	013	018	And thou shalt say, Thus saith the Lord, Woe to the [women] that sew pillows under every elbow, and make kerchiefs on the head of every stature to pervert souls! The souls of my people are perverted, and they have saved souls alive.
026	EZE	013	019	And they have dishonoured me before my people for a handful of barley, and for pieces of bread, to slay the souls which should not die, and to save alive the souls which should not live, while ye speak to a people hearing vain speeches.
026	EZE	013	020	Therefore thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I am against your pillows, whereby ye there confound souls, and I will tear them away from your arms, and will set at liberty their souls which ye pervert to scatter them.
026	EZE	013	021	And I will tear your kerchiefs, and will rescue my people out of your hands, and they shall no longer be in your hands to be confounded; and ye shall know that I am the Lord.
026	EZE	013	022	Because ye have perverted the heart of the righteous, whereas I perverted him not, and [that] in order to strengthen the hands of the wicked, that he should not at all turn from his evil way and live:
026	EZE	013	023	therefore ye shall not see false [visions], and ye shall no more utter prophecies: but I will deliver my people out of your hand; and ye shall know that I am the Lord.
026	EZE	014	001	And there came to me men of the people of Israel, of the elders, and sat before me.
026	EZE	014	002	And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
026	EZE	014	003	Son of man, these men have conceived their devices in their hearts, and have set before their faces the punishment of their iniquities: shall I indeed answer them?
026	EZE	014	004	Therefore speak to them, and thou shalt say to them, Thus saith the Lord; Any man of the house of Israel, who shall conceive his devices in his heart, and shall set the punishment of his iniquity before his face, and shall come to the prophet; I the Lord will answer him [according to the things] in which his mind is entangled,
026	EZE	014	005	that he should turn aside the house of Israel, according to their hearts that are estranged from me in their thoughts.
026	EZE	014	006	Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord God, Be converted, and turn from your [evil] practices, and from all your sins, and turn your faces back again.
026	EZE	014	007	For any man of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, who shall separate himself from me, and conceive his imaginations in his heart, and set before his face the punishment of his iniquity, and come to the prophet to enquire of him concerning me; I the Lord will answer him, [according to the things] wherein he is entangled.
026	EZE	014	008	And I will set my face against that man, and will make him desolate and ruined, and will cut him off from the midst of my people; and ye shall know that I am the Lord.
026	EZE	014	009	And if a prophet should cause to err and should speak, I the Lord have caused that prophet to err, and will stretch out my hand upon him, and will utterly destroy him from the midst of my people Israel.
026	EZE	014	010	And they shall bear their iniquity according to the trespass of him that asks; and it shall be in like manner to the prophet according to the trespass:
026	EZE	014	011	that the house of Israel may no more go astray from me, and that they may no more defile themselves with any of their transgressions: so shall they be my people, and I will be their God, saith the Lord.
026	EZE	014	012	And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
026	EZE	014	013	Son of man, if a land shall sin against me by committing a trespass, then will I stretch out my hand upon it, and will break its staff of bread, and will send forth famine upon it, and cut off from it man and beast.
026	EZE	014	014	And though these three men should be in the midst of it, Noe, and Daniel, and Job, they [alone] should be delivered by their righteousness, saith the Lord.
026	EZE	014	015	If again I bring evil beasts upon the land, and take vengeance upon it, and it be ruined, and there be no one to pass through for fear of the wild beasts:
026	EZE	014	016	and [if] these three men should be in the midst of it, [as] I live, saith the Lord, neither sons nor daughters shall be saved, but these only shall be saved, and the land shall be destroyed.
026	EZE	014	017	Or again if I bring a sword upon that land, and say, Let the sword go through the land; and I cut off from them man and beast:
026	EZE	014	018	though these three men were in the midst of it, as I live, saith the Lord, they shall not deliver sons or daughters, but they only shall be saved themselves.
026	EZE	014	019	Or [if] again I send pestilence upon that land, and pour out my wrath upon it in blood, to destroy from off it man and beast:
026	EZE	014	020	and should Noe, and Daniel, and Job, be in the midst of it, [as] I live, saith the Lord, there shall be left [them] neither sons nor daughters; [only] they by their righteousness shall deliver their souls.
026	EZE	014	021	Thus saith the Lord, And if I even send upon Jerusalem my four sore judgments, sword, and famine, and evil beasts, and pestilence, to destroy from out of it man and beast;
026	EZE	014	022	yet, behold, [there shall be] men left in it, the escaped thereof, who [shall] lead forth of it sons and daughters: behold, they [shall] go forth to you, and ye shall see their ways and their thoughts: and ye shall mourn over the evils which I have brought upon Jerusalem, [even] all the evils which I have brought upon it.
026	EZE	014	023	And they shall comfort you, because ye shall see their ways and their thoughts: and ye shall know that I have not done in vain all that I have done in it, saith the Lord.
026	EZE	015	001	And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
026	EZE	015	002	And thou, son of man—of all the wood, of the branches that are among the trees of the forest, what shall be made of the wood of the vine?
026	EZE	015	003	Will they take wood of it to make [it fit] for work? will they take of it a peg to hang any vessel upon it?
026	EZE	015	004	It is only given to the fire to be consumed; the fire consumes that which is yearly pruned of it, and it is utterly gone. Will it be useful for [any] work?
026	EZE	015	005	Not even while it is yet whole will it be [useful] for [any] work: if the fire shall have utterly consumed it, will it still be [fit] for work?
026	EZE	015	006	Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord, As the vine-tree among the trees of the forest, which I have given up to the fire to be consumed, so have I given up the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
026	EZE	015	007	And I will set my face against them; they shall go forth of the fire, and [yet] fire shall devour them; and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I have set my face against them.
026	EZE	015	008	And I will give up the land to ruin, because they have utterly transgressed, saith the Lord.
026	EZE	016	001	Moreover the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
026	EZE	016	002	Son of man, testify to Jerusalem [of] her iniquities;
026	EZE	016	003	and thou shalt say, Thus saith the Lord to Jerusalem; Thy root and thy birth are of the land of Chanaan: thy father was an Amorite, and thy mother a Chettite.
026	EZE	016	004	And [as for] thy birth in the day wherein thou wast born, thou didst not bind thy breasts, and thou wast not washed in water, neither wast thou salted with salt, neither wast thou swathed in swaddling-bands.
026	EZE	016	005	Nor did mine eye pity thee, to do for thee one of all these things, to feel at all for thee; but thou wast cast out on the face of the field, because of the deformity of thy person, in the day wherein thou wast born.
026	EZE	016	006	And I passed by to thee, and saw thee polluted in thy blood; and I said to thee, [Let there be] life out of thy blood:
026	EZE	016	007	increase; I have made thee as the springing grass of the field. So thou didst increase and grow, and didst enter into great cities: thy breasts were set, and thy hair grew, whereas thou wast naked and bare.
026	EZE	016	008	And I passed by thee and saw thee, and, behold, [it was] thy time and a time of resting; and I spread my wings over thee, and covered thy shame, and swear to thee: and I entered into covenant with thee, saith the Lord, and thou becamest mine.
026	EZE	016	009	And I washed thee in water, and washed thy blood from thee, and anointed thee with oil.
026	EZE	016	010	And I clothed thee with embroidered [garments], and clothed thee beneath with purple, and girded thee with fine linen, and clothed thee with silk,
026	EZE	016	011	and decked thee also with ornaments, and put bracelets on thine hands, and a necklace on thy neck.
026	EZE	016	012	And I put a pendant on thy nostril, and rings in thine ears, and a crown of glory on thine head.
026	EZE	016	013	So thou wast adorned with gold and silver; and thy raiment was of fine linen, and silk, and variegated work: thou didst eat fine flour, and oil, and honey, and didst become extremely beautiful.
026	EZE	016	014	And thy name went forth among the nations for thy beauty: because it was perfected with elegance, [and] in the comeliness which I put upon thee, saith the Lord.
026	EZE	016	015	Thou didst trust in thy beauty, and didst go a-whoring because of thy renown, and didst pour out thy fornication on every passer by.
026	EZE	016	016	And thou didst take of thy garments, and madest to thyself idols of needlework, and didst go a-whoring after them; therefore thou shalt never come in, nor shall [the like] take place.
026	EZE	016	017	And thou tookest thy fair ornaments of my gold and of my silver, of what I gave thee, and thou madest to thyself male images, and thou didst commit whoredom with them.
026	EZE	016	018	And thou didst take thy variegated apparel and didst clothe them, and thou didst set before them mine oil and mine incense.
026	EZE	016	019	And [thou tookest] my bread which I gave thee, ([yea] I fed thee with fine flour and oil and honey) and didst set them before them for a sweet-smelling savour: yea, it was so, saith the Lord.
026	EZE	016	020	And thou tookest thy sons and thy daughters, whom thou borest, and didst sacrifice [these] to them to be destroyed. Thou didst go a-whoring as [if that were] little,
026	EZE	016	021	and didst slay thy children, and gavest them up in offering them to them for an expiation.
026	EZE	016	022	This is beyond all thy fornication, and thou didst not remember thine infancy, when thou wast naked and bare, [and] didst live [though] defiled in thy blood.
026	EZE	016	023	And it came to pass after all thy wickedness, saith the Lord,
026	EZE	016	024	that thou didst build thyself a house of fornication, and didst make thyself a public place in every street;
026	EZE	016	025	and on the head of every way thou didst set up thy fornications, and didst defile thy beauty, and didst open thy feet to every passer by, and didst multiply thy fornication.
026	EZE	016	026	And thou didst go a-whoring after the children of Egypt thy neighbors, great of flesh; and didst go a-whoring, often to provoke me to anger.
026	EZE	016	027	And if I stretch out my hand against thee, then will I abolish thy statutes, and deliver [thee] up to the wills of them that hate thee, [even to] the daughters of the Philistines that turned thee aside from the way wherein thou sinned.
026	EZE	016	028	And thou didst go a-whoring to the daughters of Assur, and not even thus wast thou satisfied; yea, thou didst go a-whoring, and wast not satisfied.
026	EZE	016	029	And thou didst multiply thy covenants with the land of the Chaldeans; and not even with these wast thou satisfied.
026	EZE	016	030	Why should I make a covenant with thy daughter, saith the Lord, while thou doest all these things, the works of a harlot? and thou hast gone a-whoring in a threefold degree with thy daughters.
026	EZE	016	031	Thou hast built a house of harlotry in every top of a way, and hast set up thine high place in every street; and thou didst become as a harlot gathering hires.
026	EZE	016	032	An adulteress resembles thee, taking rewards of her husband.
026	EZE	016	033	She has even given rewards to all that went a-whoring after her, and thou hast given rewards to all thy lovers, yea, thou didst load them with rewards, that they should come to thee from every side for thy fornication.
026	EZE	016	034	And there has happened in thee perverseness in thy fornication beyond [other] women, and they have committed fornication with thee, in that thou givest hires over and above, and hires were not given to thee; and [thus] perverseness happened in thee.
026	EZE	016	035	Therefore, harlot, hear the word of the Lord:
026	EZE	016	036	Thus saith the Lord, Because thou hast poured forth thy money, therefore thy shame shall be discovered in thy harlotry with thy lovers, and [with] regard to all the imaginations of thine iniquities, and for the blood of thy children which thou hast given to them.
026	EZE	016	037	Therefore, behold, I [will] gather all thy lovers with whom thou hast consorted, and all whom thou hast loved, with all whom thou didst hate; and I will gather them against thee round about, and will expose thy wickedness to them, and they shall see all thy shame.
026	EZE	016	038	And I will be avenged on thee with the vengeance of an adulteress, and I will bring upon thee blood of fury and jealousy.
026	EZE	016	039	And I will deliver thee into their hands, and they shall break down thy house of harlotry, and destroy thine high place; and they shall strip thee of thy garments, and shall take thy proud ornaments, and leave thee naked and bare.
026	EZE	016	040	And they shall bring multitudes upon thee, and they shall stone thee with stones, and pierce thee with their swords.
026	EZE	016	041	And they shall burn thine houses with fire, and shall execute vengeance on thee in the sight of many women: and I will turn thee back from harlotry, and I will no more give [thee] rewards.
026	EZE	016	042	So will I slacken my fury against thee, and my jealousy shall be removed from thee, and I will rest, and be no more careful [for thee].
026	EZE	016	043	Because thou didst not remember thine infancy, and thou didst grieve me in all these things; therefore, behold, I have recompensed thy ways upon thine head, saith the Lord: for thus hast thou wrought ungodliness above all thine [other] iniquities.
026	EZE	016	044	These are all the things they have spoken against thee in a proverb, saying,
026	EZE	016	045	As is the mother, so is thy mother's daughter: thou art she that has rejected her husband and her children; and the sisters of thy sisters have rejected their husbands and their children: your mother was a Chettite, and [your] father an Amorite.
026	EZE	016	046	Your elder sister who dwells on thy left hand is Samaria, she and her daughters: and thy younger sister, that dwells on the right hand, is Sodom and her daughters.
026	EZE	016	047	Yet notwithstanding thou hast not walked in their ways, neither hast thou done according to their iniquities within a little, but thou hast exceeded them in all thy ways.
026	EZE	016	048	[As] I live, saith the Lord, this Sodom and her daughters have not done as thou and thy daughters have done.
026	EZE	016	049	Moreover this was the sin of thy sister Sodom, pride: she and her daughters lived in pleasure, in fullness of bread [and] in abundance: this belonged to her and her daughters, and they helped not the hand of the poor and needy.
026	EZE	016	050	And they boasted, and wrought iniquities before me: so I cut them off as I saw [fit].
026	EZE	016	051	Also Samaria has not sinned according to half of thy sins; but thou hast multiplied thine iniquities beyond them, and thou hast justified thy sisters in all thine iniquities which thou hast committed.
026	EZE	016	052	Thou therefore bear thy punishment, for that thou hast corrupted thy sisters by thy sins which thou hast committed beyond them; and thou hast made them [appear] more righteous than thyself: thou therefore be ashamed, and bear thy dishonour, in that thou hast justified thy sisters.
026	EZE	016	053	And I will turn their captivity, [even] the captivity of Sodom and her daughters; and I will turn the captivity of Samaria and her daughters; and I will turn thy captivity in the midst of them:
026	EZE	016	054	that thou mayest bear thy punishment, and be dishonoured for all that thou hast done in provoking me to anger.
026	EZE	016	055	And thy sister Sodom and her daughters shall be restored as they were at the beginning, and thou and thy daughters shall be restored as ye were at the beginning.
026	EZE	016	056	And surely thy sister Sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the days of thy pride:
026	EZE	016	057	before thy wickedness was discovered, even now thou art the reproach of the daughters of Syria, and of all that are round about her, [even] of the daughters of the Philistines that compass thee round about.
026	EZE	016	058	[As for] thine ungodliness and thine iniquities, thou hast borne them, saith the Lord.
026	EZE	016	059	Thus saith the Lord; I will even do to thee as thou hast done, as thou hast dealt shamefully in these things to transgress my covenant.
026	EZE	016	060	And I will remember my covenant [made] with thee in the days of thine infancy, and I will establish to thee an everlasting covenant.
026	EZE	016	061	Then thou shalt remember thy way, and shalt be utterly dishonoured when thou receivest thine elder sisters with thy younger ones: and I will give them to thee for building up, but not by thy covenant.
026	EZE	016	062	And I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt know that I am the Lord:
026	EZE	016	063	that thou mayest remember, and be ashamed, and mayest no more be able to open thy mouth for thy shame, when I am reconciled to thee for all that thou hast done, saith the Lord.
026	EZE	017	001	And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
026	EZE	017	002	Son of man, relate a tale, and speak a parable to the house of Israel:
026	EZE	017	003	and thou shalt say, Thus saith the Lord; A great eagle with large wings, spreading them out very far, with many claws, which has the design of entering into Libanus—and he took the choice [branches] of the cedar:
026	EZE	017	004	he cropped off the ends of the tender twigs, and brought them into the land of Chanaan; he laid them up in a walled city.
026	EZE	017	005	And he took of the seed of the land, and sowed it in a field planted by much water; he set it in a conspicuous place.
026	EZE	017	006	And it sprang up, and became a weak and little vine, so that the branches thereof appeared [upon] it, and its roots were under it: and it became a vine, and put forth shoots, and sent forth its tendrils.
026	EZE	017	007	And there was another great eagle, with great wings and many claws: and, behold, this vine bent itself round toward him, and her roots [were turned] towards him, and she sent forth her branches towards him, that [he] might water her together with the growth of her plantation.
026	EZE	017	008	She thrives in a fair field by much water, to produce shoots and bear fruit, that she might become a great vine.
026	EZE	017	009	Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord; Shall it prosper? shall not the roots of her tender stem and her fruit be blighted? yea, all her early shoots shall be dried up, and [that] not by a mighty arm, nor by many people, to tear her up from her roots.
026	EZE	017	010	And, behold, it thrives: shall it prosper? shall it not wither as soon as the east wind touches it? it shall be withered together with the growth of its shoots.
026	EZE	017	011	Moreover the word of the Lord came to me saying,
026	EZE	017	012	Son of man, say now to the provoking house, Know ye not what these things were? say [to them], Whenever the king of Babylon shall come against Jerusalem, then he shall take her king and her princes, and shall take them home to Babylon.
026	EZE	017	013	And he shall take of the seed royal, and shall make a covenant with him, and shall bind him with an oath: and he shall take the princes of the land:
026	EZE	017	014	that it may become a weak kingdom, so as never to lift itself up, that he may keep his covenant, and establish it.
026	EZE	017	015	And [if] he shall revolt from him, to send his messengers into Egypt, that [they] may give him horses and much people; shall he prosper? shall he that acts as an adversary be preserved? and shall he that transgresses the covenant be preserved?
026	EZE	017	016	[As] I live, saith the Lord, verily in [the] place where the king is that made him king, who dishonoured my oath, and who broke my covenant, shall he die with him in the midst of Babylon.
026	EZE	017	017	And Pharaoh shall make war upon him not with a large force or great multitude, in throwing up a mound, and in building of forts, to cut off souls.
026	EZE	017	018	Whereas he has profaned the oath so as to break the covenant, when, behold, I engage his hand, and he has done all these things to him, he shall not escape.
026	EZE	017	019	Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord; [As] I live, surely mine oath which he has profaned, and my covenant which he has transgressed, I will even recompense it upon his head.
026	EZE	017	020	And I will spread a net upon him, and he shall be caught in its snare.
026	EZE	017	021	In every battle of his they shall fall by the sword, and I will scatter [his] remnant to every wind: and ye shall know that I the Lord have spoken it.
026	EZE	017	022	For thus saith the Lord; I will even take of the choice [branches] of the cedar from the top [thereof], I will crop off their hearts, and I will plant it on a high mountain:
026	EZE	017	023	and I will hang it on a lofty mountain of Israel: yea, I will plant it, and it shall put forth shoots, and shall bear fruit, and it shall be a great cedar: and every bird shall rest beneath it, even every fowl shall rest under its shadow: its branches shall be restored.
026	EZE	017	024	And all the trees of the field shall know that I am the Lord that bring low the high tree, and exalt the low tree, and wither the green tree, and cause the dry tree to flourish: I the Lord have spoken, and will do [it].
026	EZE	018	001	And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
026	EZE	018	002	Son of man, what mean ye by this parable among the children of Israel, saying, The fathers have eaten unripe grapes, and the children's teeth have been set on edge?
026	EZE	018	003	[As] I live, saith the Lord, surely this parable shall no more be spoken in Israel.
026	EZE	018	004	For all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son, they are mine: the soul that sins, it shall die.
026	EZE	018	005	But the man who shall be just, who executes judgment and righteousness,
026	EZE	018	006	who shall not eat upon the mountains, and shall not at all lift up his eyes to the devices of the house of Israel, and shall not defile his neighbor's wife, and shall not draw nigh to her that is removed,
026	EZE	018	007	and shall not oppress any man, [but] shall return the pledge of the debtor, and shall be guilty of no plunder, shall give his bread to the hungry, and clothe the naked;
026	EZE	018	008	and shall not lend his money upon usury, and shall not receive usurious increase, and shall turn back his hand from injustice, shall execute righteous judgment between a man and his neighbor,
026	EZE	018	009	and has walked in my commandments and kept mine ordinances, to do them; he is righteous, he shall surely live, saith the Lord.
026	EZE	018	010	And if he beget a mischievous son, shedding blood and committing sins,
026	EZE	018	011	who has not walked in the way of his righteous father, but has even eaten upon the mountains, and has defiled his neighbor's wife,
026	EZE	018	012	and has oppressed the poor and needy, and has committed robbery, and not restored a pledge, and has set his eyes upon idols, has wrought iniquities,
026	EZE	018	013	has lent upon usury, and taken usurious increase; he shall by no means live: he has wrought all these iniquities; he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon him.
026	EZE	018	014	And if he beget a son, and [the son] see all his father's sins which he has wrought, and fear, and not do according to them,
026	EZE	018	015	and [if he] has not eaten on the mountains, and has not set his eyes on the devices of the house of Israel, and has not defiled his neighbor's wife,
026	EZE	018	016	and has not oppressed a man, and has not retained the pledge, nor committed robbery, has given his bread to the hungry, and has clothed the naked,
026	EZE	018	017	and has turned back his hand from unrighteousness, has not received interest or usurious increase, has wrought righteousness, and walked in mine ordinances; he shall not die for the iniquities of his father, he shall surely live.
026	EZE	018	018	But if his father grievously afflict, or plunder, he has wrought enmity in the midst of my people, and shall die in his iniquity.
026	EZE	018	019	But ye will say, Why has not the son borne the iniquity of the father? Because the son has wrought judgment and mercy, has kept all my statues, and done them, he shall surely live.
026	EZE	018	020	But the soul that sins shall die: and the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, nor shall the father bear the iniquity of the son: the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the iniquity of the transgressor shall be upon him.
026	EZE	018	021	And if the transgressor turn away from all his iniquities which he has committed, and keep all my commandments, and do justice and mercy, he shall surely live, and shall by no means die.
026	EZE	018	022	None of his trespasses which he has committed shall be remembers: in his righteousness which he has done he shall live.
026	EZE	018	023	Shall I at all desire death of the sinner, saith the Lord, as I [desire] that he should turn from [his] evil way, and live?
026	EZE	018	024	But when the righteous man turns away from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, according to all the transgressions which the transgressor has wrought, none of his righteousness which he has wrought shall be at all remembered: in his trespass wherein he has trespassed, and in his sins wherein he has sinned, in them shall he die.
026	EZE	018	025	Yet ye have said, The way of the Lord is not straight. Hear now, all the house of Israel; will not my way be straight? Is your way straight?
026	EZE	018	026	When the righteous turns away from his righteousness and commits a trespass, and dies in the trespass he has committed, he shall [even] die in it.
026	EZE	018	027	And when the wicked man turns away from his wickedness that he has committed, and shall do judgment and justice, he has kept his soul,
026	EZE	018	028	and has turned away from all his ungodliness which he has committed: he shall surely live, he shall not die.
026	EZE	018	029	Yet the house of Israel say, The way of the Lord is not right. Is not my way right, O house of Israel? is not your way wrong?
026	EZE	018	030	I will judge you, O house of Israel, saith the Lord, each one according to his way: be converted, and turn from all your ungodliness, and it shall not become to you the punishment of iniquity.
026	EZE	018	031	Cast away from yourselves all your ungodliness wherein ye have sinned against me; and make to yourselves a new heart and a new spirit: for why should ye die, O house of Israel?
026	EZE	018	032	For I desire not the death of him that dies, saith the Lord.
026	EZE	019	001	Moreover do thou take up a lamentation for the prince of Israel,
026	EZE	019	002	and say, Why is thy mother become a whelp in the midst of lions? in the midst of lions she has multiplied her whelps.
026	EZE	019	003	And one of her whelps sprang forth; he became a lion, and learned to take prey, he devoured men.
026	EZE	019	004	And the nations heard a report of him; he was caught in their pit, and they brought him into the land of Egypt in chains.
026	EZE	019	005	And she saw that he was driven away from her, [and] her hope [of him] perished, and she took another of her whelps; she made him a lion.
026	EZE	019	006	And he went up and down in the midst of lions, he became a lion, and learned to take prey, he devoured men.
026	EZE	019	007	And he prowled in his boldness and laid waste their cities, and made the land desolate, and the fullness of it, by the voice of his roaring.
026	EZE	019	008	Then the nations set upon him from the countries round about, and they spread their nets upon him: he was taken in their pit.
026	EZE	019	009	And they put him in chains and in a cage, [and] he came to the king of Babylon; and he cast him into prison, that his voice should not be heard on the mountains of Israel.
026	EZE	019	010	Thy mother was as a vine and as a blossom on a pomegranate tree, planted by water: her fruit and her shoot abounded by reason of much water.
026	EZE	019	011	And she became a rod for a tribe of princes, and was elevated in her bulk in the midst of [other] trees, and she saw her bulk in the multitude of her branches.
026	EZE	019	012	But she was broken down in wrath, she was cast upon the ground, and the east wind dried up her choice [branches]: vengeance came upon them, and the rod of her strength was withered; fire consumed it.
026	EZE	019	013	And now they have planted her in the wilderness, in a dry land.
026	EZE	019	014	And fire is gone out of a rod of her choice [boughs], and has devoured her; and there was no rod of strength in her. Her race is become a parable of lamentation, and it shall be for a lamentation.
026	EZE	020	001	And it came to pass in the seventh year, on the fifteenth day of the month, there came men of the elders of the house of Israel to enquire of the Lord, and they sat before me.
026	EZE	020	002	And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
026	EZE	020	003	Son of man, speak to the elders of the house of Israel, and thou shalt say to them, Thus saith the Lord; Are ye come to enquire of me? [As] I live, I will not be enquired of by you, saith the Lord.
026	EZE	020	004	Shall I utterly take vengeance on them, son of man? testify to them of the iniquities of their fathers:
026	EZE	020	005	and thou shalt say to them, Thus saith the Lord; From the day that I chose the house of Israel, and became known to the seed of the house of Jacob, and was known to them in the land of Egypt, and helped them with my hand, saying, I am the Lord your God;
026	EZE	020	006	in that day I helped them with my hand, to bring them out of the land of Egypt into the land which I prepared for them, a land flowing with milk and honey, it is abundant beyond every land.
026	EZE	020	007	And I said to them, Let every one cast away the abominations of his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the devices of Egypt: I am the Lord your God.
026	EZE	020	008	But they revolted from me, and would not hearken to me: they cast not away the abominations of their eyes, and forsook not the devices of Egypt: then I said that I would pour out my wrath upon them, to accomplish my wrath upon them in the midst of Egypt.
026	EZE	020	009	But I wrought [so] that my name should not be at all profaned in the sight of the Gentiles, in the midst of whom they are, among whom I was made known to them in their sight, to bring them out of the land of Egypt.
026	EZE	020	010	And I brought them into the wilderness.
026	EZE	020	011	And I gave them my commandments, and made known to them mine ordinances, all which [if] a man shall do, he shall even live in them.
026	EZE	020	012	And I gave them my sabbaths, that they should be for a sign between me and them, that they should know that I am the Lord that sanctify them.
026	EZE	020	013	And I said to the house of Israel in the wilderness, Walk ye in my commandments: but they walked not [in them], and they rejected mine ordinances, which [if] a man shall do, he shall even live in them; and they grievously profaned my sabbaths: and I said that I would pour out my wrath upon them in the wilderness, to consume them.
026	EZE	020	014	But I wrought [so] that my name should not be at all profaned before the Gentiles, before whose eyes I brought them out.
026	EZE	020	015	But I lifted up my hand against them in the wilderness once for all, that I would not bring them into the land which I gave them, a land flowing with milk and honey, it is sweeter than all lands:
026	EZE	020	016	because they rejected mine ordinances, and walked not in my commandments, but profaned my sabbaths, and went after the imaginations of their hearts.
026	EZE	020	017	Yet mine eyes spared them, so as [not] to destroy them utterly, and I did not make an end of them in the wilderness.
026	EZE	020	018	And I said to their children in the wilderness, Walk not ye in the customs of your fathers, and keep not their ordinances, and have no fellowship with their practices, nor defile yourselves [with them].
026	EZE	020	019	I [am] the Lord your God; walk in my commandments, and keep mine ordinances, and do them;
026	EZE	020	020	and hallow my sabbaths, and let them be a sign between me and you, that ye may know that I am the Lord your God.
026	EZE	020	021	But they provoked me, and their children walked not in my commandments, and they took no heed to mine ordinances to do them, which [if] a man shall do, he shall even live in them, and they profaned my sabbaths: then I said that I would pour out my wrath upon them in the wilderness, to accomplish mine anger upon them.
026	EZE	020	022	But I wrought so that my name might not be at all profaned before the Gentiles; and I brought them out in their sight.
026	EZE	020	023	I lifted up my hand against them in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the Gentiles, [and] disperse them in the countries;
026	EZE	020	024	because they kept not mine ordinances, and rejected my commandments, and profaned my sabbaths, and their eyes went after the imaginations of their fathers.
026	EZE	020	025	So I gave them commandments [that were] not good, and ordinances in which they should not live.
026	EZE	020	026	And I will defile them by their [own] decrees, when I pass through upon every one that opens the womb, that I may destroy them.
026	EZE	020	027	Therefore, son of man, speak to the house of Israel, and thou shalt say to them, Thus saith the Lord: Hitherto have your fathers provoked me in their trespasses in which they transgressed against me.
026	EZE	020	028	Whereas I brought them into the land concerning which I lifted up mine hand to give it them; and they looked upon every high hill, and every shady tree, and they sacrificed there to their gods, and offered there sweet-smelling savour, and there they poured out their drink-offerings.
026	EZE	020	029	And I said to them, What is Abama, that ye go in thither? and they called its name Abama, until this day.
026	EZE	020	030	Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord, Do ye pollute yourselves with the iniquities of your fathers, and do ye go a-whoring after their abominations,
026	EZE	020	031	and [do ye pollute yourselves] with the first-fruits of your gifts, in the offerings wherewith ye pollute yourselves in all your imaginations, until this day; and shall I answer you, O house of Israel? [As] I live, saith the Lord, I will not answer you, neither shall this thing come upon your spirit.
026	EZE	020	032	And it shall not be as ye say, We will be as the nations, and as the tribes of the earth, to worship stocks and stones.
026	EZE	020	033	Therefore, [as] I live, saith the Lord, I will reign over you with a strong hand, and with a high arm, and with outpoured wrath:
026	EZE	020	034	I will bring you out from the nations, and will take you out of the lands wherein ye were dispersed, with a strong hand, and with a high arm, and with outpoured wrath.
026	EZE	020	035	And I will bring you into the wilderness of the nations, and will plead with you there face to face.
026	EZE	020	036	As I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so will I judge you, saith the Lord.
026	EZE	020	037	And I will cause you to pass under my rod, and I will bring you in by number.
026	EZE	020	038	And I will separate from among you the ungodly and the revolters; for I will lead them forth out of their place of sojourning, and they shall not enter into the land of Israel: and ye shall know that I am the Lord, [even] the Lord.
026	EZE	020	039	And [as to] you, O house of Israel, thus saith the Lord, [even] the Lord; Put away each one his [evil] practices, and hereafter if ye hearken to me, then shall ye no more profane my holy name by your gifts and by devices.
026	EZE	020	040	For upon my holy mountain, on the high mountain, saith the Lord, [even] the Lord, there shall all the house of Israel serve me for ever: and there will I accept [you], and there will I have respect to your first-fruits, and the first-fruits of your offerings, in all your holy things.
026	EZE	020	041	I will accept you with a sweet-smelling savour, when I bring you out from the nations, and take you out of the countries wherein ye have been dispersed; and I will be sanctified among you in the sight of the nations.
026	EZE	020	042	And ye shall know that I am the Lord, when I have brought you into the land of Israel, into the land concerning which I lifted up my hand to give it to your fathers.
026	EZE	020	043	And ye shall there remember your ways, and your devices wherewith ye defiled yourselves; and ye shall bewail yourselves for all your wickedness.
026	EZE	020	044	And ye shall know that I am the Lord, when I have done thus to you, that my name may not be profaned in your evil ways, and in your corrupt devices, saith the Lord.
026	EZE	020	045	And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
026	EZE	020	046	Son of man, set thy face against Thaeman, and look toward Darom, and prophesy against the chief forest of Nageb,
026	EZE	020	047	and thou shalt say to the forest of Nageb, Hear the word of the Lord; thus saith the Lord, [even] the Lord; Behold, I [will] kindle a fire in thee, and it shall devour in thee every green tree, and every dry tree: the flame that is kindled shall not be quenched, and every face shall be scorched with it from the south to the north.
026	EZE	020	048	And all flesh shall know that I the Lord have kindled it: it shall not be quenched.
026	EZE	020	049	And I said, Not so, O Lord God! they say to me, Is not this that is spoken a parable?
026	EZE	021	001	And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
026	EZE	021	002	Therefore prophesy, son of man, set thy face steadfastly toward Jerusalem, and look toward their holy places, and thou shalt prophesy against the land of Israel,
026	EZE	021	003	and thou shalt say to the land of Israel, Thus saith the Lord; Behold, I am against thee, and I will draw forth my sword out of its sheath, and I will destroy out of thee the transgressor and unrighteous.
026	EZE	021	004	Because I will destroy out of thee the unrighteous and the transgressor, [therefore] so shall my sword come forth out of its sheath against all flesh from the south to the north:
026	EZE	021	005	and all flesh shall know that I the Lord have drawn forth my sword out of its sheath: it shall not return any more.
026	EZE	021	006	And thou, son of man, groan with the breaking of thy loins; thou shalt even groan heavily in their sight.
026	EZE	021	007	And it shall come to pass, if they shall say to thee, Wherefore dost thou groan? that thou shalt say, For the report; because it comes: and every heart shall break, and all hands shall become feeble, and all flesh and every spirit shall faint, and all thighs shall be defiled with moisture: behold, it comes, saith the Lord.
026	EZE	021	008	And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
026	EZE	021	009	Son of man, prophesy, and thou shalt say, Thus saith the Lord; Say, Sword, sword, be sharpened and rage,
026	EZE	021	010	that thou mayest slay victims; be sharpened that thou mayest be bright, ready for slaughter, slay, set at nought, despise every tree.
026	EZE	021	011	And he made it ready for his hand to hold: the sword is sharpened, it is ready to put into the hand of the slayer.
026	EZE	021	012	Cry out and howl, son of man: for this [sword] is come upon my people, this [sword is come] upon all the princes of Israel: they shall be as strangers: [judgment] with the sword is come upon my people: therefore clap thine hands, for sentence has been passed:
026	EZE	021	013	and what if even the tribe be rejected? it shall not be, saith the Lord God.
026	EZE	021	014	And thou, son of man, prophesy, and clap thine hands, and take a second sword: the third sword is [the sword] of the slain, the great sword of the slain: and thou shalt strike them with amazement, lest the heart should faint
026	EZE	021	015	and the weak ones be multiplied at every gate—they are given up to the slaughter of the sword: it is well fitted for slaughter, it is well fitted for glittering.
026	EZE	021	016	And do thou go on, sharpen thyself on the right and on the left whithersoever thy face may set itself.
026	EZE	021	017	And I also will clap my hands, and let loose my fury: I the Lord have spoken [it].
026	EZE	021	018	And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
026	EZE	021	019	and thou, son of man, appoint thee two ways, that the sword of the king of Babylon may enter in: the two shall go forth of one country; and [there shall be] a force at the top of the way of the city, thou shalt set [it] at the top of the way,
026	EZE	021	020	that the sword may enter in upon Rabbath of the children of Ammon, and upon Judea, and upon Jerusalem in the midst thereof.
026	EZE	021	021	For the king of Babylon shall stand on the old way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination, to make bright the arrow, and to enquire of the graven images, and to examine [the victims].
026	EZE	021	022	On his right was the divination against Jerusalem, to cast a mound, to open the mouth in shouting, to lift up the voice with crying, to cast a mound against her gates, to cast up a heap, and to build forts.
026	EZE	021	023	And he was to them as one using divination before them, and he himself recounting his iniquities, that they might be borne in mind.
026	EZE	021	024	Therefore thus saith the Lord, Because ye have caused your iniquities to be remembered, in the discovery of your wickedness, so that your sins should be seen, in all your wickedness and in your [evil] practices; because ye have caused remembrance [of them], in these shall ye be taken.
026	EZE	021	025	And thou profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day, [even] an end, is come in a sea of iniquity, thus saith the Lord;
026	EZE	021	026	Thou hast taken off the mitre and put on the crown, it shall not have such [another] after it: thou hast abased that which was high, and exalted that which was low.
026	EZE	021	027	Injustice, injustice, injustice, will I make it: woe to it: such shall it be until he comes to whom it belongs; and I will deliver [it] to him.
026	EZE	021	028	And thou, son of man, prophesy, and thou shalt say, Thus saith the Lord, concerning the children of Ammon, and concerning their reproach; and thou shalt say, O sword, sword, drawn for slaughter, and drawn for destruction, awake, that thou mayest gleam.
026	EZE	021	029	While thou art seeing vain [visions], and while thou art prophesying falsehoods, to bring thyself upon the necks of ungodly transgressors, the day is come, [even] an end, in a season of iniquity.
026	EZE	021	030	Turn, rest not in this place wherein thou wert born: in thine own land will I judge thee.
026	EZE	021	031	And I will pour out my wrath upon thee, I will blow upon thee with the fire of my wrath, and I will deliver thee into the hands of barbarians skilled in working destruction.
026	EZE	021	032	Thou shalt be fuel for fire; thy blood shall be in the midst of thy land; there shall be no remembrance at all of thee: for I the Lord have spoken [it].
026	EZE	022	001	And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
026	EZE	022	002	And thou, son of man, wilt thou judge the bloody city? yea, declare thou to her all her iniquities.
026	EZE	022	003	And thou shalt say, Thus saith the Lord God: O city that sheds blood in the midst of her, so that her time should come, and that forms devices against herself, to defile herself;
026	EZE	022	004	in their blood which thou hast shed, thou hast transgressed; and in thy devices which thou hast formed, thou hast polluted thyself; and thou hast brought nigh thy days, and hast brought on the time of thy years: therefore have I made thee a reproach to the Gentiles, and a mockery to all the countries,
026	EZE	022	005	to those near thee, and to those far distant from thee; and they shall mock thee, [thou that art] notoriously unclean, and abundant in iniquities.
026	EZE	022	006	Behold, the princes of the house of Israel have conspired in thee each one with his kindred, that they might shed blood.
026	EZE	022	007	In thee they have reviled father and mother; and in thee they have behaved unjustly toward the stranger: they have oppressed the orphan and widow.
026	EZE	022	008	And they have set at nought my holy things, and in thee they have profaned my sabbaths.
026	EZE	022	009	[There are] robbers in thee, to shed blood in thee; and in thee they have eaten upon the mountains: they have wrought ungodliness in the midst of thee.
026	EZE	022	010	In thee they have uncovered the father's shame; and in thee they have humbled her that was set apart for uncleanness.
026	EZE	022	011	They have dealt unlawfully each one with his neighbor's wife; and each one in ungodliness has defiled his daughter-in-law: and in thee they have humbled each one his sister, the daughter of his father.
026	EZE	022	012	In thee they have received gifts to shed blood; they have received in thee interest and usurious increase; and by oppression thou hast brought thy wickedness to the full, and hast forgotten me, saith the Lord.
026	EZE	022	013	And if I shall smite my hand at [thine iniquities] which thou hast accomplished, which thou hast wrought, and at thy blood that has been shed in the midst of thee,
026	EZE	022	014	shall thy heart endure? shall thine hands be strong in the days which I bring upon thee? I the Lord have spoken, and will do [it].
026	EZE	022	015	And I will scatter thee among the nations, and disperse thee in the countries, and thy uncleanness shall be removed out of thee.
026	EZE	022	016	And I will give heritages in thee in the sight of the nations, and ye shall know that I am the Lord.
026	EZE	022	017	And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
026	EZE	022	018	Son of man, behold, the house of Israel are all become to me [as it were] mixed with brass, and iron, and tin, and lead; they are mixed up in the midst of the silver.
026	EZE	022	019	Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord God; Because ye have become one mixture, therefore I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem.
026	EZE	022	020	As silver, and brass, and iron, and tin, and lead, are gathered into the midst of the furnace, to blow fire into it, that they may be melted: so will I take [you] in my wrath, and I will gather and melt you.
026	EZE	022	021	And I will blow upon you in the fire of my wrath, and ye shall be melted in the midst thereof.
026	EZE	022	022	As silver is melted in the midst of a furnace, so shall ye be melted in the midst thereof; and ye shall know that I the Lord have poured out my wrath upon you.
026	EZE	022	023	And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
026	EZE	022	024	Son of man, say to her, Thou art the land that is not rained upon, neither has rain come upon thee in the day of wrath;
026	EZE	022	025	whose princes in the midst of her are as roaring lions seizing prey, devouring souls by oppression, and taking bribes; and thy widows are multiplied in the midst of thee.
026	EZE	022	026	Her priests also have set at nought my law, and profaned my holy things: they have not distinguished between the holy and profane, nor have they distinguished between the unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths, and I was profaned in the midst of them.
026	EZE	022	027	Her princes in the midst of her are as wolves ravening to shed blood, that they may get dishonest gain.
026	EZE	022	028	And her prophets that daub them shall fall, that see vanities, that prophesy falsehoods, saying, Thus saith the Lord, when the Lord has not spoken.
026	EZE	022	029	That sorely oppress the people of the land with injustice, and commit robbery; oppressing the poor and needy, and not dealing justly with the stranger.
026	EZE	022	030	And I sought from among them a man behaving uprightly, and standing before me perfectly in the time of wrath, so that I should not utterly destroy her: but I found [him] not.
026	EZE	022	031	So I have poured out my wrath upon her in the fury of mine anger, to accomplish [it]. I have recompensed their ways on their own heads, saith the Lord God.
026	EZE	023	001	And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
026	EZE	023	002	Son of man, there were two women, daughters of one mother:
026	EZE	023	003	and they went a-whoring in Egypt in their youth: there their breasts fell, there they lost their virginity.
026	EZE	023	004	And their names were Oola the elder, and Ooliba her sister: and they were mine, and bore sons and daughters: and [as for] their names, Samaria was Oola, and Jerusalem was Ooliba.
026	EZE	023	005	And Oola went a-whoring from me, and doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians that were her neighbors,
026	EZE	023	006	clothed with purple, princes and captains; [they were] young men and choice, all horseman riding on horses.
026	EZE	023	007	And she bestowed her fornication upon them; all were choice sons of the Assyrians: and on whomsoever she doted herself, with them she defiled herself in all [their] devices.
026	EZE	023	008	And she forsook not her fornication with the Egyptians: for in her youth they committed fornication with her, and they deflowered her, and poured out their fornication upon her.
026	EZE	023	009	Therefore I delivered her into the hands of her lovers, into the hands of the children of the Assyrians, on whom she doted.
026	EZE	023	010	They uncovered her shame: they took her sons and daughters, and slew her with the sword: and she became a byword among women: and they wrought vengeance in her for the sake of the daughters.
026	EZE	023	011	And her sister Ooliba saw [it], and she indulged in her fondness more corruptly than she, and in her fornication more than the fornication of her sister.
026	EZE	023	012	She doted upon the sons of the Assyrian, princes and captains, her neighbours, clothed with fine linen, horsemen riding on horses; [they were] all choice young men.
026	EZE	023	013	And I saw that they were defiled, [that] the two [had] one way.
026	EZE	023	014	And she increased her fornication, and she saw men painted on the wall, likenesses of the Chaldeans painted with a pencil,
026	EZE	023	015	having variegated girdles on their loins, having also richly dyed [attire] upon their heads; all had a princely appearance, the likeness of the children of the Chaldeans, of their native land.
026	EZE	023	016	And she doted upon them as soon as she saw them, and sent forth messengers to them into the land of the Chaldeans.
026	EZE	023	017	And the sons of Babylon came to her, into the bed of rest, and they defiled her in her fornication, and she was defiled by them, and her soul was alienated from them.
026	EZE	023	018	And she exposed her fornication, and exposed her shame: and my soul was alienated from her, even as my soul was alienated from her sister.
026	EZE	023	019	And thou didst multiply thy fornication, so as to call to remembrance the days of thy youth, wherein thou didst commit whoredom in Egypt,
026	EZE	023	020	and thou didst dote upon the Chaldeans, whose flesh is as the flesh of the asses, and their members [as] the members of horses.
026	EZE	023	021	And thou didst look upon the iniquity of thy youth, [the things] which thou wroughtest in Egypt in thy lodgings, where were the breasts of thy youth.
026	EZE	023	022	Therefore, Ooliba, thus saith the Lord; Behold, I [will] stir up thy lovers against thee, from whom thy soul is alienated, and I will bring them upon thee round about,
026	EZE	023	023	the children of Babylon, and all the Chaldeans, Phacuc, and Sue, and Hychue, and all the sons of the Assyrians with them; choice young men, governors and captains, all princes and renowned, riding on horses.
026	EZE	023	024	And they all shall come upon thee from the north, chariots and wheels, with a multitude of nations, shields and targets; and [the enemy] shall set a watch against thee round about: and I will set judgment before them, and they shall take vengeance on thee with their judgments.
026	EZE	023	025	And I will bring upon thee my jealousy, and they shall deal with thee in great wrath: they shall take away thy nose and thine ears; and shall cast down thy remnant with the sword: they shall take thy sons and thy daughters; and thy remnant fire shall devour.
026	EZE	023	026	And they shall strip thee of thy raiment, and take [away] thine ornaments.
026	EZE	023	027	So I will turn back thine ungodliness from thee, and thy fornication from the land of Egypt: and thou shalt not lift up thine eyes upon them, and shalt no more remember Egypt.
026	EZE	023	028	Wherefore thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I [will] deliver thee into the hands of those whom thou hatest, from whom thy soul is alienated.
026	EZE	023	029	And they shall deal with thee in hatred, and shall take all [the fruits] of thy labours and thy toils, and thou shalt be naked and bare: and the shame of thy fornication shall be exposed: and thy ungodliness and thy fornication
026	EZE	023	030	brought this upon thee, in that thou wentest a-whoring after the nations, and didst defile thyself with their devices.
026	EZE	023	031	Thou didst walk in the way of thy sister; and I will put her cup into thine hands.
026	EZE	023	032	Thus saith the Lord; Drink thy sister's cup, deep and large, and full, to cause complete drunkenness.
026	EZE	023	033	And thou shalt be thoroughly weakened; and the cup of destruction, the cup of thy sister Samaria,
026	EZE	023	034	drink thou it, and I will take away her feasts and her new moons: for I have spoken [it], saith the Lord.
026	EZE	023	035	Therefore thus saith the Lord; Because thou has forgotten me, and cast me behind thy back, therefore receive thou [the reward] of thine ungodliness and thy fornication.
026	EZE	023	036	And the Lord said to me, Son of man, wilt thou not judge Oola and Ooliba? and declare to them their iniquities?
026	EZE	023	037	For they have committed adultery, and blood was in their hands, they committed adultery with their devices, and they passed through the fire to them their children which they bore to me.
026	EZE	023	038	So long too as they did these things to me, they defiled my sanctuary, and profaned my sabbaths.
026	EZE	023	039	And when they sacrificed their children to their idols, they also went into my sanctuary to profane it: and whereas they did thus in the midst of my house;
026	EZE	023	040	and whereas they did thus to the men that came from afar, to whom they sent messengers, and as soon as they came, immediately thou didst wash thyself, and didst paint thine eyes and adorn thyself with ornaments,
026	EZE	023	041	and satest on a prepared bed, and before it [there was] a table set out, and [as for] mine incense and mine oil, they rejoiced in them,
026	EZE	023	042	and they raised a sound of music, and [that] with men coming from the wilderness out of a multitude of men, and they put bracelets on their hands, and a crown of glory on their heads;
026	EZE	023	043	Therefore I said, Do they not commit adultery with these? and has she also gone a-whoring [after] the manner of a harlot?
026	EZE	023	044	And they went in to her, as [men] go in to a harlot; so they went in to Oola and to Ooliba to work iniquity.
026	EZE	023	045	And they are just men, and shall take vengeance on them with the judgment of an adulteress and the judgment of blood: for they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands.
026	EZE	023	046	Thus saith the Lord God, Bring up a multitude upon them, and send trouble and plunder into the midst of them.
026	EZE	023	047	And stone them with the stones of a multitude, and pierce them with their swords: they shall slay their sons and their daughters, and shall burn up their houses.
026	EZE	023	048	And I will remove ungodliness out of the land, and all the women shall be instructed, and shall not do according to their ungodliness.
026	EZE	023	049	And your ungodliness shall be recompensed upon you, and ye shall bear the guilt of your devices: and ye shall know that I am the Lord.
026	EZE	024	001	And the word of the Lord came to me, in the ninth year, in the tenth month, on the tenth [day] of the month, saying,
026	EZE	024	002	Son of man, write for thyself daily from this day, on which the king of Babylon set himself against Jerusalem, [even] from this day.
026	EZE	024	003	And speak a parable to the provoking house, and thou shalt say to them, Thus saith the Lord; Set on the caldron, and pour water into it:
026	EZE	024	004	and put the pieces into it, every prime piece, the leg and shoulder taken off from the bones,
026	EZE	024	005	[which are] taken from choice cattle, and burn the bones under them: her bones are boiled and cooked in the midst of her.
026	EZE	024	006	Therefore thus saith the Lord; O bloody city, the caldron in which there is scum, and the scum has not gone out of, she has brought it forth piece by piece, no lot has fallen upon it.
026	EZE	024	007	For her blood is in the midst of her; I have set it upon a smooth rock: I have not poured it out upon the earth, so that the earth should cover it;
026	EZE	024	008	that my wrath should come up for complete vengeance to be taken: I set her blood upon a smooth rock, so as not to cover it.
026	EZE	024	009	Therefore thus saith the Lord, I will also make the firebrand great,
026	EZE	024	010	and I will multiply the wood, and kindle the fire, that the flesh may be consumed, and the liquor boiled away;
026	EZE	024	011	and that [it] may stand upon the coals, that her brass may be thoroughly heated, and be melted in the midst of her filthiness, and her scum may be consumed,
026	EZE	024	012	and her abundant scum may not come forth of her.
026	EZE	024	013	Her scum shall become shameful, because thou didst defile thyself: and what if thou shalt be purged no more until I have accomplished my wrath?
026	EZE	024	014	I the Lord have spoken; and it shall come, and I will do [it]; I will not delay, neither will I have any mercy: I will judge thee, saith the Lord, according to thy ways, and according to thy devices: therefore will I judge thee according to thy bloodshed, and according to thy devices will I judge thee, thou unclean, notorious, and abundantly provoking one.
026	EZE	024	015	And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
026	EZE	024	016	Son of man, behold I take from thee the desire of thine eyes by violence: thou shalt not lament, neither shalt thou weep.
026	EZE	024	017	Thou shalt groan for blood, and have mourning upon thy loins; thy hair shall not be braided upon thee, and thy sandals [shall be] on thy feet; thou shalt in no wise be comforted by their lips, and thou shalt not eat the bread of men.
026	EZE	024	018	And I spoke to the people in the morning, as he commanded me in the evening, and I did in the morning as it was commanded me.
026	EZE	024	019	And the people said to me, Wilt thou not tell us what these things are that thou doest?
026	EZE	024	020	Then I said to them, The word of the Lord came to me, saying,
026	EZE	024	021	Say to the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord; Behold, I [will] profane my sanctuary, the boast of your strength, the desire of your eyes, and for which your souls are concerned; and your sons and your daughters, whom ye have left, shall fall by the sword.
026	EZE	024	022	And ye shall do as I have done: ye shall not be comforted at their mouth, and ye shall not eat the bread of men.
026	EZE	024	023	And your hair [shall be] upon your head, and your shoes on your feet: neither shall ye at all lament or weep; but ye shall pine away in your iniquities, and shall comfort every one his brother.
026	EZE	024	024	And Jezekiel shall be for a sign to you: according to all that I have done shall ye do, when these things shall come; and ye shall know that I am the Lord.
026	EZE	024	025	And thou, son of man, [shall it] not [be] in the day when I take their strength from them, the pride of their boasting, the desires of their eyes, and the pride of their soul, their sons and their daughters,
026	EZE	024	026	that in that day he that escapes shall come to thee, to tell [it] thee in thine ears?
026	EZE	024	027	In that day thy mouth shall be opened to him that escapes; thou shalt speak, and shalt be no longer dumb: and thou shalt be for a sign to them, and they shall know that I am the Lord.
026	EZE	025	001	And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
026	EZE	025	002	Son of man, set thy face steadfastly against the children of Ammon, and prophesy against them;
026	EZE	025	003	and thou shalt say to the children of Ammon, Hear ye the word of the Lord; thus saith the Lord; Forasmuch as ye have rejoiced against my sanctuary, because it was profaned; and against the land of Israel, because it was laid waste; and against the house of Juda, because they went into captivity;
026	EZE	025	004	therefore, behold, I [will] deliver you to the children of Kedem for an inheritance, and they shall lodge in thee with their stuff, and they shall pitch their tents in thee: they shall eat thy fruits, and they shall drink thy milk.
026	EZE	025	005	And I will give up the city of Ammon for camels' pastures, and the children of Ammon for a pasture of sheep: and ye shall know that I am the Lord.
026	EZE	025	006	For thus saith the Lord; Because thou hast clapped thine hands, and stamped with thy foot, and heartily rejoiced against the land of Israel;
026	EZE	025	007	therefore I will stretch out my hand against thee, and I will make thee a spoil to the nations; and I will utterly destroy thee from among the peoples, and I will completely cut thee off from out of the countries: and thou shalt know that I am the Lord.
026	EZE	025	008	Thus saith the Lord; Because Moab has said, Behold, are not the house of Israel and Juda like all the [other] nations?
026	EZE	025	009	Therefore, behold, I will weaken the shoulder of Moab from his frontier cities, [even] the choice land, the house of Bethasimuth above the fountain of the city, by the sea-side.
026	EZE	025	010	I have given him the children of Kedem in addition to the children of Ammon for an inheritance, that there may be no remembrance of the children of Ammon.
026	EZE	025	011	And I will execute vengeance on Moab; and they shall know that I am the Lord.
026	EZE	025	012	Thus saith the Lord; Because of what the Idumeans have done in taking vengeance on the house of Juda, and [because they] have remembered injuries, and have exacted full recompense;
026	EZE	025	013	therefore thus saith the Lord; I will also stretch out my hand upon Idumea, and will utterly destroy out of it man and beast; and will make it desolate; and they that are pursued out of Thaeman shall fall by the sword.
026	EZE	025	014	And I will execute my vengeance on Idumea by the hand of my people Israel: and they shall deal in Idumea according to mine anger and according to my wrath, and they shall know my vengeance, saith the Lord.
026	EZE	025	015	Therefore thus saith the Lord, Because the Philistines have wrought revengefully, and raised up vengeance rejoicing from their heart to destroy [the Israelites] to a man;
026	EZE	025	016	therefore thus saith the Lord; Behold, I [will] stretch out my hand upon the Philistines, and will utterly destroy the Cretans, and will cut off the remnant that dwell by the sea-coast.
026	EZE	025	017	And I will execute great vengeance upon them; and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I have brought my vengeance upon them.
026	EZE	026	001	And it came to pass in the eleventh year, on the first [day] of the month, [that] the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
026	EZE	026	002	Son of man, because Sor has said against Jerusalem, Aha, she is crushed: the nations are destroyed: she is turned to me: she that was full is made desolate:
026	EZE	026	003	therefore thus saith the Lord; Behold, I am against thee, O Sor, and I will bring up many nations against thee, as the sea comes up with its waves.
026	EZE	026	004	And they shall cast down the walls of Sor, and shall cast down thy towers: and I will scrape her dust from off her, and make her a bare rock.
026	EZE	026	005	She shall be in the midst of the sea a place for repairing nets: for I have spoken [it], saith the Lord: and it shall be a spoil for the nations.
026	EZE	026	006	And her daughters [which are] in the field shall be slain with the sword, and they shall know that I am the Lord.
026	EZE	026	007	For thus saith the Lord; Behold, I [will] bring up against thee, O Sor, Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon from the north: he is a king of kings, with horses, and chariots, and horsemen, and a concourse of very many nations.
026	EZE	026	008	He shall slay thy daughters that are in the field with the sword, and shall set a watch against thee, and build forts around thee, and carry a rampart round against thee, and set up warlike works, and array his spears against thee.
026	EZE	026	009	He shall cast down with his swords thy walls and thy towers.
026	EZE	026	010	By reason of thy multitude of his horses their dust shall cover thee, and by reason of the sound of his horsemen and the wheels of his chariots the walls shall be shaken, when he enters into thy gates, as one entering into a city from the plain.
026	EZE	026	011	With the hoofs of his horses they shall trample all thy streets: he shall slay thy people with the sword, and shall bring down to the ground the support of thy strength.
026	EZE	026	012	And he shall prey upon thy power, and plunder thy substance, and shall cast down thy walls, and break down thy pleasant houses: and he shall cast thy stones and thy timber and thy dust into the midst of thy sea.
026	EZE	026	013	And he shall destroy the multitude of thy musicians, and the sound of thy psalteries shall be heard no more.
026	EZE	026	014	And I will make thee a bare rock: thou shalt be a place to spread nets upon; thou shalt be built no more: for I the Lord have spoken [it], saith the Lord.
026	EZE	026	015	For thus saith the Lord God to Sor; Shall not the isles shake at the sound of thy fall, while the wounded are groaning, while they have drawn a sword in the midst of thee?
026	EZE	026	016	And all the princes of the nations of the sea shall come down from their thrones, and shall take off their crowns from their heads, and shall take off their embroidered raiment: they shall be utterly amazed; they shall sit upon the ground, and fear their [own] destruction, and shall groan over thee.
026	EZE	026	017	And they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and shall say to thee, How art thou destroyed from out of the sea, the renowned city, that brought her terror upon all her inhabitants.
026	EZE	026	018	And the isles shall be alarmed at the day of thy fall.
026	EZE	026	019	For thus saith the Lord God; When I shall make the city desolate, as the cities that shall not be inhabited, when I have brought the deep up upon thee,
026	EZE	026	020	and great waters shall cover thee; and I shall bring thee down to them that go down to the pit, to the people of old time, and shall cause thee to dwell in the depths of the earth, as in everlasting desolation, with them that go down to the pit, that thou mayest not be inhabited, nor stand upon the land of life;
026	EZE	026	021	I will make thee a destruction, and thou shalt be no more for ever, saith the Lord God.
026	EZE	027	001	And the word of the Lord came to me saying,
026	EZE	027	002	And thou, son of man, take up a lamentation against Sor;
026	EZE	027	003	and thou shalt say to Sor that dwells at the entrance of the sea, to the mart of the nations coming from many islands, Thus saith the Lord to Sor; Thou hast said, I have clothed myself with my beauty.
026	EZE	027	004	In the heart of the sea thy sons have put beauty upon thee for Beelim.
026	EZE	027	005	Cedar in Senir was employed for thee in building: boards of cypress timber were taken out of Libanus, and wood to make thee masts of fir.
026	EZE	027	006	They made thine oars [of wood] out of the land of Basan; thy sacred utensils they made of ivory, thy shady houses of wood from the isles of Chetiim.
026	EZE	027	007	Fine linen with embroidery from Egypt supplied the couch, to put honour upon thee, and to clothe thee with blue and purple from the isles of Elisai; and they became thy coverings.
026	EZE	027	008	And thy princes were the dwellers in Sidon, and the Aradians were thy rowers: thy wise men, O Sor, who were in thee, these were thy pilots.
026	EZE	027	009	The elders of the Biblians, and their wise men, who were in thee, these helped thy counsel: and all the ships of the sea and their rowers traded for thee to the utmost west.
026	EZE	027	010	Persians and Lydians and Libyans were in thine army: thy warriors hung in thee shields and helmets; these gave [thee] thy glory.
026	EZE	027	011	The sons of the Aradians and thine army were upon the walls; there were guards in thy towers: they hung their quivers on thy battlements round about; these completed thy beauty.
026	EZE	027	012	The Carthaginians were thy merchants because of the abundance of all thy strength; they furnished thy market with silver, and gold, and iron, and tin, and lead.
026	EZE	027	013	Greece, both the whole [world], and the adjacent coasts, these traded with thee in the persons of men, and they gave [as] thy merchandise vessels of brass.
026	EZE	027	014	Out of the house of Thogarma horses and horsemen furnished the market.
026	EZE	027	015	The sons of the Rhodians were thy merchants; from the islands they multiplied thy merchandise, [even] elephants' teeth: and to them that came in thou didst return thy prices,
026	EZE	027	016	[even] men [as] thy merchandise, from the multitude of thy trading [population], myrrh and embroidered works from Tharsis: Ramoth also and Chorchor furnished thy market.
026	EZE	027	017	Juda and the children of Israel, these were thy merchants; in the sale of corn and ointments and cassia: and they gave the best honey, and oil, and resin, to thy trading [population].
026	EZE	027	018	[The people of] Damascus were thy merchants by reason of the abundance of all thy power; wine out of Chelbon, and wool from Miletus; and they brought wine into thy market.
026	EZE	027	019	Out of Asel [came] wrought iron, and there is the sound of wheels among thy trading [population].
026	EZE	027	020	[The people of] Daedan were thy merchants, with choice cattle for chariots.
026	EZE	027	021	Arabia and all the princes of Kedar, these were thy traders with thee, [bringing] camels, and lambs, and rams, in which they trade with thee.
026	EZE	027	022	The merchants of Sabba and Ramma, these were thy merchants, with choice spices, and precious stones: and they brought gold to thy market.
026	EZE	027	023	Charra, and Chanaa, these were thy merchants: Assur, and Charman, were thy merchants:
026	EZE	027	024	bringing [for] merchandise blue, and choice stores bound with cords, and cypress wood.
026	EZE	027	025	Ships were thy merchants, in abundance, with thy trading [population]: and thou wast filled and very heavily loaded in the heart of the sea.
026	EZE	027	026	Thy rowers have brought thee into great waters: the south wind has broken thee in the heart of the sea.
026	EZE	027	027	Thy forces, and thy gain, and that of thy traders, and thy rowers, and thy pilots, and thy counselors, and they that traffic with thee, and all thy warriors that are in thee: and all thy company in the midst of thee shall perish in the heart of the sea, in the day of thy fall.
026	EZE	027	028	At the cry of thy voice thy pilots shall be greatly terrified.
026	EZE	027	029	And all the rowers and the mariners shall come down from the ships, and the pilots of the sea shall stand on the land.
026	EZE	027	030	And they shall wail over thee with their voice, and cry bitterly, and put earth on their heads, and spread ashes under them.
026	EZE	027	032	And their sons shall take up a [lament] for thee, even a lamentation for Sor, [saying],
026	EZE	027	033	How large a reward hast thou gained from the sea? thou hast filled nations out of thine abundance; and out of thy mixed merchandise thou hast enriched all the kings of the earth.
026	EZE	027	034	Now art thou broken in the sea, thy traders are in the deep water, and all thy company in the midst of thee: all thy rowers have fallen.
026	EZE	027	035	All the dwellers in the islands have mourned over thee, and their kings have been utterly amazed, and their countenance has wept.
026	EZE	027	036	Merchants from the nations have hissed at thee; thou art utterly destroyed, and shalt not be any more for ever.
026	EZE	028	001	And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
026	EZE	028	002	And thou, son of man, say to the prince of Tyrus, Thus saith the Lord; Because thine heart has been exalted, and thou hast said, I am God, I have inhabited the dwelling of God in the heart of the sea; yet thou art man and not God, though thou hast set thine heart as the heart of God:
026	EZE	028	003	art thou wiser than Daniel? or have not the wise instructed thee with their knowledge?
026	EZE	028	004	Hast thou gained power for thyself by thine [own] knowledge or thine [own] prudence, and [gotten] gold and silver in thy treasures?
026	EZE	028	005	By thy abundant knowledge and thy traffic thou hast multiplied thy power; thy heart has been lifted up by thy power.
026	EZE	028	006	Therefore thus saith the Lord; Since thou hast set thine heart as the hart of God;
026	EZE	028	007	because of this, behold, I [will] bring on thee strange plagues from the nations; and they shall draw their swords against thee, and against the beauty of thy knowledge,
026	EZE	028	008	and they shall bring down thy beauty to destruction. And they shall bring thee down; and thou shalt die the death of the slain in the heart of the sea.
026	EZE	028	009	Wilt thou indeed say, I am God, before them that slay thee? whereas thou art man, and not God.
026	EZE	028	010	Thou shalt perish by the hands of strangers among the multitude of the uncircumcised: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord.
026	EZE	028	011	And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
026	EZE	028	012	Son of man, take up a lamentation for the prince of Tyre, and say to him, Thus saith the Lord God; Thou art a seal of resemblance, and crown of beauty.
026	EZE	028	013	Thou wast in the delight of the paradise of God; thou hast bound upon thee every precious stone, the sardius, and topaz, and emerald, and carbuncle, and sapphire, and jasper, and silver, and gold, and ligure, and agate, and amethyst, and chrysolite, and beryl, and onyx: and thou hast filled thy treasures and thy stores in thee with gold.
026	EZE	028	014	From the day that thou wast created thou [wast] with the cherub: I set thee on the holy mount of God; thou wast in the midst of the stones of fire.
026	EZE	028	015	Thou wast faultless in thy days, from the day that thou wast created, until iniquity was found in thee.
026	EZE	028	016	Of the abundance of thy merchandise thou hast filled thy storehouses with iniquity, and hast sinned: therefore thou hast been cast down wounded from the mount of God, and the cherub has brought thee out of the midst of the stones of fire.
026	EZE	028	017	Thy heart has been lifted up because of thy beauty; thy knowledge has been corrupted with thy beauty: because of the multitude of thy sins I have cast thee to the ground, I have caused thee to be put to open shame before kings.
026	EZE	028	018	Because of the multitude of thy sins and the iniquities of thy merchandise, I have profaned thy sacred things; and I will bring fire out of the midst of thee, this shall devour thee; and I will make thee [to be] ashes upon thy land before all that see thee.
026	EZE	028	019	And all that know thee among the nations shall groan over thee: thou art gone to destruction, and thou shalt not exist any more.
026	EZE	028	020	And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
026	EZE	028	021	Son of man, set thy face against Sidon, and prophesy against it,
026	EZE	028	022	and say, Thus saith the Lord; Behold, I am against thee, O Sidon; and I will be glorified in thee; and thou shalt know that I am the Lord, when I have wrought judgments in thee, and I will be sanctified in thee.
026	EZE	028	023	Blood and death [shall be] in thy streets; and [men] wounded with swords shall fall in thee and on every side of thee; and they shall know that I am the Lord.
026	EZE	028	024	And there shall no more be in the house of Israel a thorn of bitterness and a pricking briar proceeding from them that are round about them, who dishonoured them; and they shall know that I am the Lord.
026	EZE	028	025	Thus saith the Lord God; I will also gather Israel from the nations, among whom they have been scattered, and I will be sanctified among them, and before the peoples and nations: and they shall dwell upon their land, which I gave to my servant Jacob.
026	EZE	028	026	Yea, they shall dwell upon it safely, and they shall build houses, and plant vineyards, and dwell securely, when I shall execute judgment on all that have dishonoured them, [even] on those [that are] round about them; and they shall know that I am the Lord their God, and the God of their fathers.
026	EZE	029	001	In the twelfth year, in the tenth month, on the first [day] of the month, the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
026	EZE	029	002	Son of man, set thy face against Pharao king of Egypt, and prophesy against him, and against the whole of Egypt:
026	EZE	029	003	and say, Thus saith the Lord; Behold, I am against Pharao, the great dragon that lies in the midst of his rivers, that says, The rivers are mine, and I made them.
026	EZE	029	004	And I will put hooks in thy jaws, and I will cause the fish of thy river to stick to thy sides, and I will bring thee up out of the midst of thy river:
026	EZE	029	005	and I will quickly cast down thee and all the fish of thy river: thou shalt fall on the face of the plain, and shalt by no means be gathered, and shalt not be brought together: I have given thee for food to the wild beasts of the earth and to the fowls of the sky.
026	EZE	029	006	And all the dwellers in Egypt shall know that I am the Lord, because thou hast been a staff of reed to the house of Israel.
026	EZE	029	007	When they took hold of thee with their hand, thou didst break: and when every hand was clapped against them, and when they leaned on thee, thou wast utterly broken, and didst crush the loins of them all.
026	EZE	029	008	Therefore thus saith the Lord; Behold, I [will] bring a sword upon thee, and will cut off from thee man and beast;
026	EZE	029	009	and the land of Egypt shall be ruined and desert; and they shall know that I am the Lord; because thou sayest, The rivers are mine, and I made them.
026	EZE	029	010	Therefore, behold, I am against thee, and against all thy rivers, and I will give up the land of Egypt to desolation, and the sword, and destruction, from Magdol and Syene even to the borders of the Ethiopians.
026	EZE	029	011	No foot of man shall pass through it, and no foot of beast shall pass through it, and it shall not be inhabited for forty years.
026	EZE	029	012	And I will cause her land to be utterly destroyed in the midst of a land that is desolate, and her cities shall be [desolate] forty years in the midst of cities that are desolate: and I will disperse Egypt among the nations, and will utterly scatter them into the countries.
026	EZE	029	013	Thus saith the Lord; After forty years I will gather the Egyptians from the nations among whom they have been scattered;
026	EZE	029	014	and I will turn the captivity of the Egyptians, and will cause them to dwell in the land of Phathore, in the land whence they were taken;
026	EZE	029	015	and it shall be a base kingdom beyond all [other] kingdoms; it shall not any more be exalted over the nations; and I will make them few in number, that they may not be [great] among the nations.
026	EZE	029	016	And they shall no more be to the house of Israel a confidence bringing iniquity to remembrance, when they follow after them; and they shall know that I am the Lord.
026	EZE	029	017	And it came to pass in the twenty-seventh year, on the first [day] of the month, the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
026	EZE	029	018	Son of man, Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon caused his army to serve a great service against Tyre; every head was bald, and every shoulder peeled; yet there was no reward to him or to his army [serving] against Tyre, nor for the service wherewith they served against it.
026	EZE	029	019	Thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I [will] give to Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon the land of Egypt, and he shall take the plunder thereof, and seize the spoils thereof; and [it] shall be a reward for his army.
026	EZE	029	020	In return for his service wherewith he served against Tyre, I have given him the land of Egypt; thus saith the Lord God:
026	EZE	029	021	In that day shall a horn spring forth for all the house of Israel, and I will give thee an open mouth in the midst of them; and they shall know that I am the Lord.
026	EZE	030	001	And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
026	EZE	030	002	Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith the Lord; Woe, woe [worth] the day!
026	EZE	030	003	For the day of the Lord is nigh, a day of cloud; it shall be the end of the nations.
026	EZE	030	004	And the sword shall come upon the Egyptians, and there shall be tumult in Ethiopia, and in Egypt [men] shall fall down slain together, and her foundations shall fall.
026	EZE	030	005	Persians, and Cretans, and Lydians, and Libyans, and all the mixed multitude, and they of the children of my covenant, shall fall by the sword therein.
026	EZE	030	006	And the supports of Egypt shall fall; and the pride of her strength shall come down from Magdol to Syene: they shall fall by the sword in it, saith the Lord.
026	EZE	030	007	And it shall be made desolate in the midst of desolate countries, and their cities shall be [desolate] in the midst of desolate cities:
026	EZE	030	008	and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall send fire upon Egypt, and [when] all that help her shall be broken.
026	EZE	030	009	In that day shall messengers go forth hasting to destroy Ethiopia utterly, and there shall be tumult among them in the day of Egypt: for, behold it comes.
026	EZE	030	010	Thus saith the Lord God; I will also destroy the multitude of the Egyptians by the hand of Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon,
026	EZE	030	011	his [hand] and his people's; [they are] plagues sent forth from the nations to destroy the land: and they all shall unsheath their swords against Egypt, and the land shall be filled with slain.
026	EZE	030	012	And I will make their rivers desolate, and will destroy the land and the fulness of it by the hands of strangers: I the Lord have spoken.
026	EZE	030	013	For thus saith the Lord God; I will also destroy the nobles from Memphis, and the princes of Memphis out of the land of Egypt; and they shall be no more.
026	EZE	030	014	And I will destroy the land of Phathore, and will send fire upon Tanis, and will execute vengeance on Diospolis.
026	EZE	030	015	And I will pour out my wrath upon Sais the strength of Egypt, and will destroy the multitude of Memphis.
026	EZE	030	016	And I will send fire upon Egypt; and Syene shall be sorely troubled; and there shall be a breaking in Diospolis, and waters shall be poured out.
026	EZE	030	017	The youths of Heliopolis and Bubastum shall fall by the sword, and the women shall go into captivity.
026	EZE	030	018	And the day shall be darkened in Taphnae, when I have broken there the scepters of Egypt: and the pride of her strength shall perish there: and a cloud shall cover her, and her daughters shall be taken prisoners.
026	EZE	030	019	And I will execute judgment on Egypt; and they shall know that I am the Lord.
026	EZE	030	020	And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first month, on the seventh [day] of the month, the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
026	EZE	030	021	Son of man, I have broken the arms of Pharao, king of Egypt; and, behold, it has not been bound up to be healed, to have a plaster put upon it, [or] to be strengthened to lay hold of the sword.
026	EZE	030	022	Therefore thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I am against Pharao king of Egypt, and I will break his strong and outstretched arms, and will smite down his sword out of his hand.
026	EZE	030	023	And I will disperse the Egyptians among the nations, and will utterly scatter them among the countries.
026	EZE	030	024	And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and put my sword into his hand: and he shall bring it upon Egypt, and shall take her plunder and seize her spoils.
026	EZE	030	025	Yea, I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and the arms of Pharao shall fail: and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I have put my sword into the hands of the king of Babylon, and he shall stretch it out over the land of Egypt.
026	EZE	030	026	And I will disperse the Egyptians among the nations, and utterly scatter them among the countries; and they all shall know that I am the Lord.
026	EZE	031	001	And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the third month, on the first [day] of the month, the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
026	EZE	031	002	Son of man, say to Pharao king of Egypt, and to his multitude; To whom hast thou compared thyself in thy haughtiness?
026	EZE	031	003	Behold, the Assyrian was a cypress in Libanus, and was fair in shoots, and high in stature: his top reached to the midst of the clouds.
026	EZE	031	004	The water nourished him, the depth made him grow tall; she led her rivers round about his plants, and she sent forth her streams to all the trees of the field.
026	EZE	031	005	Therefore was his stature exalted above all the trees of the field, and his branches spread far by the help of much water.
026	EZE	031	006	All the birds of the sky made their nests in his boughs, and under his branches all the wild beasts of the field bred; the whole multitude of nations dwelt under his shadow.
026	EZE	031	007	And he was fair in his height by reason of the multitude of his branches: for his roots were amidst much water.
026	EZE	031	008	And such cypresses [as this] were in the paradise of God; and there were no pines like his shoots, and there were no firs like his branches: no tree in the paradise of God was like him in his beauty,
026	EZE	031	009	because of the multitude of his branches: and the trees of God's paradise of delight envied him.
026	EZE	031	010	Therefore thus saith the Lord; Because thou art grown great, and hast set thy top in the midst of the clouds, and I saw when he was exalted;
026	EZE	031	011	therefore I delivered him into the hands of the prince of the nations, and he wrought his destruction.
026	EZE	031	012	And ravaging strangers from the nations have destroyed him, and have cast him down upon the mountains: his branches fell in all the valleys, and his boughs were broken in every field of the land; and all the people of the nations are gone down from their shelter, and have laid him low.
026	EZE	031	013	All the birds of the sky have settled on his fallen trunk, and all the wild beasts of the field came upon his boughs:
026	EZE	031	014	in order that none of the trees by the water should exalt themselves by reason of their size: whereas they set their top in the midst of the clouds, yet they continued not in their high state in their place, all that drank water, all were consigned to death, to the depth of the earth, in the midst of the children of men, with them that go down to the pit.
026	EZE	031	015	Thus saith the Lord God; In the day wherein he went down to Hades, the deep mourned for him: and I stayed her floods, and restrained her abundance of water: and Libanus saddened for him, all the trees of the field fainted for him.
026	EZE	031	016	At the sound of his fall the nations quaked, when I brought him down to Hades with them that go down to the pit: and all the trees of Delight comforted him in the heart, and the choice of [plants] of Libanus, all that drink water.
026	EZE	031	017	For they went down to hell with him among the slain with the sword; and his seed, [even] they that dwelt under his shadow, perished in the midst of their life.
026	EZE	031	018	To whom art thou compared? descend, and be thou debased with the trees of paradise to the depth of the earth: thou shalt lie in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that are slain by the sword. Thus shall Pharao be, and the multitude of his host, saith the Lord God.
026	EZE	032	001	And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the tenth month, on the first [day] of the month, [that] the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
026	EZE	032	002	Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharao king of Egypt, and say to him, Thou art become like a lion of the nations, and as a serpent that is in the sea: and thou didst make assaults with thy rivers, and didst disturb the water with thy feet, and didst trample thy rivers.
026	EZE	032	003	Thus saith the Lord; I will also cast over thee the nets of many nations, and will bring thee up with my hook:
026	EZE	032	004	and I will stretch thee upon the earth: the fields shall be covered [with thee], and I will cause all the birds of the sky to settle upon thee, and I will fill [with thee] all the wild beasts of the earth.
026	EZE	032	005	And I will cast thy flesh upon the mountains, and will saturate [them] with thy blood.
026	EZE	032	006	And the land shall be drenched with thy dung, because of thy multitude upon the mountains: I will fill the valleys with thee.
026	EZE	032	007	And I will veil the heavens when thou art extinguished, and will darken the stars thereof; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not give her light.
026	EZE	032	008	All the [bodies] that give light in the sky, shall be darkened over thee, and I will bring darkness upon the earth, saith the Lord God.
026	EZE	032	009	And I will provoke to anger the heart of many people, when I shall lead thee captive among the nations, to a land which thou hast not known.
026	EZE	032	010	And many nations shall mourn over thee, and their kings shall be utterly amazed, when my sword flies in their faces, as they wait for their [own] fall from the day of thy fall.
026	EZE	032	011	For thus saith the Lord God; The sword of the king of Babylon shall come upon thee,
026	EZE	032	012	with the swords of mighty men; and I will cast down thy strength: [they are] all destroying ones from the nations, and they shall destroy the pride of Egypt, and all her strength shall be crushed.
026	EZE	032	013	And I will destroy all her cattle from [beside] the great water; and the foot of man shall not trouble it any more, and the step of cattle shall no more trample it.
026	EZE	032	014	Thus shall their waters then be at rest, and their rivers shall flow like oil, saith the Lord,
026	EZE	032	015	when I shall give up Egypt to destruction, and the land shall be made desolate with the fullness thereof; when I shall scatter all that dwell in it, and they shall know that I am the Lord.
026	EZE	032	016	There is a lamentation, and thou shalt utter it; and the daughters of the nations shall utter it, [even] for Egypt, and they shall mourn for it over all the strength thereof, saith the Lord God.
026	EZE	032	017	And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the first month, on the fifteenth [day] of the month, the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
026	EZE	032	018	Son of man, lament over the strength of Egypt, for the nations shall bring down her daughters dead to the depth of the earth, to them that go down to the pit.
026	EZE	032	020	They shall fall with him in the midst of them [that are] slain with the sword, and all his strength shall perish: the giants also shall say to thee,
026	EZE	032	021	Be thou in the depth of the pit: to whom art thou superior? yea, go down, and lie with the uncircumcised, in the midst of them [that are] slain with the sword.
026	EZE	032	022	There are Assur and all his company: all [his] slain have been laid there:
026	EZE	032	023	and their burial is in the depth of the pit, and his company are set around about his tomb: all the slain that fell by the sword, who had caused the fear of them [to be] upon the land of the living.
026	EZE	032	024	There is Aelam and all his host round about his tomb: all the slain that fell by the sword, and the uncircumcised that go down to the deep of the earth, who caused their fear to be upon the land of the living: and they have received their punishment with them that go down to the pit,
026	EZE	032	025	in the midst of the slain.
026	EZE	032	026	There were laid Mosoch, and Thobel, and all his strength round about his tomb: all his slain men, all the uncircumcised, slain with the sword, who caused their fear to be in the land of the living.
026	EZE	032	027	And they are laid with the giants that fell of old, who went down to Hades with [their] weapons of war: and they laid their swords under their heads, but their iniquities were upon their bones, because they terrified all men during their life.
026	EZE	032	028	And thou shalt lie in the midst of the uncircumcised, with them that have been slain by the sword.
026	EZE	032	029	There are laid the princes of Assur, who yielded their strength to a wound of the sword: these are laid with the slain, with them that go down to the pit.
026	EZE	032	030	There are the princes of the north, [even] all the captains of Assur, who go down slain [to Hades]: they lie uncircumcised among the slain with the sword together with their terror and their strength, and they have received their punishment with them that go down to the pit.
026	EZE	032	031	King Pharao shall see them, and shall be comforted over all their force, saith the Lord God.
026	EZE	032	032	For I have caused his fear to be upon the land of the living yet he shall lie in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that are slain with the sword, [even] Pharao, and all his multitude with him, saith the Lord God.
026	EZE	033	001	And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
026	EZE	033	002	Son of man, speak to the children of thy people, and thou shalt say to them, On whatsoever land I shall bring a sword, and the people of the land take one man of them, and set him for their watchman:
026	EZE	033	003	and he shall see the sword coming upon the land, and blow the trumpet, and sound an alarm to the people;
026	EZE	033	004	and he that hears the sound of the trumpet shall hear [indeed], and [yet] not take heed, and the sword shall come upon him, and overtake him, his blood shall be upon his [own] head.
026	EZE	033	005	Because he heard the sound of the trumpet, and took no heed, his blood shall be upon him: but the other, because he took heed, has delivered his soul.
026	EZE	033	006	But if the watchman see the sword coming, and do not sound the trumpet, and the people do not watch; and the sword come, and take a soul from among them, that [soul] is taken because of its iniquity; but the blood [thereof] will I require at the watchman's hand.
026	EZE	033	007	And thou, son of man, I have set thee [as] a watchman to the house of Israel, and thou shalt hear a word from my mouth.
026	EZE	033	008	When I say to the sinner, Thou shalt surely die; [if] thou speak not to warn the wicked from his way, the wicked himself shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.
026	EZE	033	009	But if thou forewarn the wicked of his way to turn from it, and he turn not from his way, he shall die in his ungodliness; but thou hast delivered thine own soul.
026	EZE	033	010	And thou, son of man, say to the house of Israel; Thus have ye spoken, saying, Our errors, and our iniquities weigh upon us, and we pine away in them, and how then shall we live?
026	EZE	033	011	Say to them, Thus saith the Lord; [As] I live, I desire not the death of the ungodly, as that the ungodly should turn from his way and live: turn ye heartily from your way; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?
026	EZE	033	012	Say to the children of thy people, The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him, in the day wherein he errs: and the iniquity of the ungodly shall not harm him, in the day wherein he turns from his iniquity, but the righteous [erring] shall not be able to deliver himself.
026	EZE	033	013	When I say to the righteous, [Thou shalt live; and] he trusts in his righteousness, and shall commit iniquity, none of his righteousnesses shall be remembered; in his unrighteousness which he has wrought, in it shall he die.
026	EZE	033	014	And when I say to the ungodly, Thou shalt surely die; and he shall turn from his sin, and do judgment and justice,
026	EZE	033	015	and return the pledge, and repay that which he has robbed, [and] walk in the ordinances of life, so as to do no wrong; he shall surely live, and shall not die.
026	EZE	033	016	None of his sins which he has committed shall be remembered: because he has wrought judgment and righteousness; by them shall he live.
026	EZE	033	017	Yet the children of thy people will say, The way of the Lord is not straight: whereas this their way is not straight.
026	EZE	033	018	When the righteous turns away from his righteousness, and shall commit iniquities, then shall he die in them.
026	EZE	033	019	And when the sinner turns from his iniquity, and shall do judgment and righteousness, he shall live by them.
026	EZE	033	020	And this is that which ye said, The way of the Lord is [not] straight. I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one for his ways.
026	EZE	033	021	And it came to pass in the tenth year of our captivity, in the twelfth month, on the fifth [day] of the month, [that] one that had escaped from Jerusalem came to me, saying, The city is taken.
026	EZE	033	022	Now the hand of the Lord had come upon me in the evening, before he came; and he opened my mouth, when he came to me in the morning: and my mouth was open, it was no longer kept closed.
026	EZE	033	023	And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
026	EZE	033	024	Son of man, they that inhabit the desolate [places] on the land of Israel say, Abram was one, and he possessed the land: and we are more numerous; to us the land is given for a possession.
026	EZE	033	027	Therefore say to them, Thus saith the Lord God, [As] I live, surely they that are in the desolate places shall fall by swords and they that are in the open plain shall be given for food to the wild beasts of the field, and them that are in the fortified [cities] and them that are in the caves I will slay with pestilence.
026	EZE	033	028	And I will make the land desert, and the pride of her strength shall perish; and the mountains of Israel shall be made desolate by reason of no man passing through.
026	EZE	033	029	And they shall know that I am the Lord; and I will make their land desert, and it shall be made desolate because of all their abominations which they have wrought.
026	EZE	033	030	And [as for] thee, son of man, the children of thy people are they that speak concerning thee by the walls, and in the porches of the houses, and they talk one to another, saying, Let us come together, and let us hear the [words] that proceed from the Lord.
026	EZE	033	031	They approach thee as a people comes together, and sit before thee, and hear thy words, but they will not do them: for [there is] falsehood in their mouth, and their heart [goes] after their pollutions.
026	EZE	033	032	And thou art to them as a sound of a sweet, well-tuned psaltery, and they will hear thy words, but they will not do them.
026	EZE	033	033	But whenever it shall come [to pass], they will say, Behold, it is come: and they shall know that there was a prophet in the midst of them.
026	EZE	034	001	And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
026	EZE	034	002	Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy, and say to the shepherds, Thus saith the Lord God; O shepherds of Israel, do shepherds feed themselves? do not the shepherds feed the sheep?
026	EZE	034	003	Behold, ye feed on the milk, and clothe yourselves with the wool, and slay the fat: but ye feed not my sheep.
026	EZE	034	004	The weak one ye have not strengthened, and the sick ye have not cherished, and the bruised ye have not bound up, and the stray one ye have not turned back, and the lost ye have not sought; and the strong ye have wearied with labour.
026	EZE	034	005	And my sheep were scattered, because there were no shepherds: and they became meat to all the wild beasts of the field.
026	EZE	034	006	And my sheep were scattered on every mountain, and on every high hill: yea, they were scattered on the face of the earth, and there was none to seek them out, nor to bring them back.
026	EZE	034	007	Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of the Lord.
026	EZE	034	008	[As] I live, saith the Lord God, surely because my sheep became a prey, and my sheep became meat to all the wild beasts of the field, because there were no shepherds, and the shepherds sought not out my sheep, and the shepherds fed themselves, but fed not my sheep.
026	EZE	034	009	For this cause, O shepherds,
026	EZE	034	010	thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I am against the shepherds; and I will require my sheep at their hands, and will turn them back that they shall not feed my sheep, and the shepherds shall no longer feed them; and I will deliver my sheep out of their mouth, and they shall no longer be meat for them.
026	EZE	034	011	For thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I will seek out my sheep, and will visit them.
026	EZE	034	012	As the shepherd seeks his flock, in the day when there is darkness and cloud, in the midst of the sheep that are separated: so will I seek out my sheep, and will bring them back from every place where they were scattered in the day of cloud and darkness.
026	EZE	034	013	And I will bring them out from the Gentiles, and will gather them from the countries, and will bring them into their own land, and will feed them upon the mountains of Israel, and in the valleys, and in every inhabited place of the land.
026	EZE	034	014	I will feed them in a good pasture, on a high mountain of Israel: and their folds shall be there, and they shall lie down, and there shall they rest in perfect prosperity, and they shall feed in a fat pasture on the mountains of Israel.
026	EZE	034	015	I will feed my sheep, and I will cause them to rest; and they shall know that I am the Lord: thus saith the Lord God.
026	EZE	034	016	I will seek that which is lost, and I will recover the stray one, and will bind up that which was broken, and will strengthen the fainting, and will guard the strong, and will feed them with judgment.
026	EZE	034	017	And [as for] you, ye sheep, thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I will distinguish between sheep and sheep, [between] rams and he-goats.
026	EZE	034	018	And [is it] not enough for you that ye fed on the good pasture, that ye trampled with your feet the remnant of your pasture? and [that] ye drank the standing water, [that] ye disturbed the residue with your feet?
026	EZE	034	019	So my sheep fed on that which ye had trampled with your feet; and they drank the water that had been disturbed by your feet.
026	EZE	034	020	Therefore thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I will separate between the strong sheep and the weak sheep.
026	EZE	034	021	Ye did thrust with your sides and shoulders, and pushed with your horns, and ye cruelly treated all the sick.
026	EZE	034	022	Therefore I will save my sheep, and they shall not be any more for a prey; and will judge between ram and ram.
026	EZE	034	023	And I will raise up one shepherd over them, and he shall tend them, [even] my servant David, and he shall be their shepherd;
026	EZE	034	024	and I the Lord will be to them a God, and David a prince in the midst of them; I the Lord have spoken it.
026	EZE	034	025	And I will make with David a covenant of peace and I will utterly destroy evil beasts from off the land; and they shall dwell in the wilderness, and sleep in the forests.
026	EZE	034	026	And I will settle them round about my mountain; and I will give you the rain, the rain of blessing.
026	EZE	034	027	And the trees that are in the field shall yield their fruit, and the earth shall yield her strength, and they shall dwell in the confidence of peace on their land, and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I have broken their yoke; and I will deliver them out of the hand of those that enslaved them.
026	EZE	034	028	And they shall no more be a spoil to the nations, and the wild beasts of the land shall no more at all devour them; and they shall dwell safely, and there shall be none to make them afraid.
026	EZE	034	029	And I will raise up for them a plant of peace, and they shall no more perish with hunger upon the land, and they shall no more bear the reproach of the nations.
026	EZE	034	030	And they shall know that I am the Lord their God, and they my people. O house of Israel, saith the Lord God,
026	EZE	034	031	ye are my sheep, even the sheep of my flock, and I am the Lord your God, saith the Lord God.
026	EZE	035	001	And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
026	EZE	035	002	Son of man, set thy face against mount Seir, and prophesy against it,
026	EZE	035	003	and say to it, Thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I am against thee, O mount Seir, and I will stretch out my hand against thee, and will make thee a waste, and thou shalt be made desolate.
026	EZE	035	004	And I will cause desolation in thy cities, and thou shalt be desolate, and thou shalt know that I am the Lord.
026	EZE	035	005	Because thou hast been a perpetual enemy, and hast laid wait craftily for the house of Israel, with the hand of enemies with a sword, in the time of injustice, at the last:
026	EZE	035	006	Therefore, as I live, saith the Lord God, verily thou hast sinned even to blood, therefore blood shall pursue thee.
026	EZE	035	007	And I will make mount Seir a waste, and desolate, and I will destroy from off it men and cattle:
026	EZE	035	008	and I will fill thy hills and thy valleys with slain men, and in all thy plains there shall fall in thee men slain with the sword.
026	EZE	035	009	I will make thee a perpetual desolation, and thy cities shall not be inhabited any more: and thou shalt know that I am the Lord.
026	EZE	035	010	Because thou saidst, The two nations and the two countries shall be mine, and I shall inherit them; whereas the Lord is there:
026	EZE	035	011	therefore, [as] I live, saith the Lord, I will even deal with thee according to thine enmity, and I will be made known to thee when I shall judge thee:
026	EZE	035	012	and thou shalt know that I am the Lord. I have heard the voice of thy blasphemies, whereas thou hast said, The desert mountains of Israel are given to us for food;
026	EZE	035	013	and thou hast spoken swelling words against me with thy mouth: I have heard [them].
026	EZE	035	014	Thus saith the Lord; When all the earth is rejoicing, I will make thee desert.
026	EZE	035	015	Thou shalt be desert, O mount Seir, and all Idumea; and it shall be utterly consumed: and thou shalt know that I am the Lord their God.
026	EZE	036	001	And thou, son of man, prophesy to the mountains of Israel, and say to the mountains of Israel, Hear ye the word of the Lord:
026	EZE	036	002	Thus saith the Lord God; Because the enemy has said against you, Aha, the old waste places are become a possession for us:
026	EZE	036	003	therefore prophesy, and say, Thus saith the Lord God; Because ye have been dishonoured, and hated by those round about you, that ye might be a possession to the remainder of the nations, and ye became a by-word, and a reproach to the nations:
026	EZE	036	004	therefore, ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord; Thus saith the Lord to the mountains, and to the hills, and to the streams, and to the valleys, and to [the places] that have been made desolate and destroyed, and to the cities that have been deserted, and have become a spoil and a trampling to the nations that were left round about;
026	EZE	036	005	therefore, thus saith the Lord; Verily in the fire of my wrath have I spoken against the rest of the nations, and against all Idumea, because they have appropriated my land to themselves for a possession with joy, disregarding the lives [of the inhabitants], to destroy [it] by plunder:
026	EZE	036	006	therefore prophesy concerning the land of Israel, and say to the mountains, and to the hills, and to the valleys, and to the forests, Thus saith the Lord; Behold, I have spoken in my jealousy and in my wrath, because ye have borne the reproaches of the heathen:
026	EZE	036	007	therefore I will lift up my hand against the nations that are round about you; they shall bear their reproach.
026	EZE	036	008	But your grapes and your fruits, O mountains of Israel, shall my people eat; for they are hoping to come.
026	EZE	036	009	For, behold, I am toward you, and I will have respect to you, and ye shall be tilled and sown:
026	EZE	036	010	and I will multiply men upon you, [even] all the house of Israel to the end: and the cities shall be inhabited, and the desolate land shall be built upon.
026	EZE	036	011	And I will multiply men and cattle upon you; and I will cause you to dwell as at the beginning, and will treat you well, as in your former [times]: and ye shall know that I am the Lord.
026	EZE	036	012	And I will increase men upon you, [even] my people Israel; and they shall inherit you, and ye shall be to them for a possession; and ye shall no more be bereaved of them.
026	EZE	036	013	Thus saith the Lord God: Because they said to thee, Thou [land] devourest men, and hast been bereaved of thy nation;
026	EZE	036	014	therefore thou shalt no more devour men, and thou shalt no more bereave thy nation, saith the Lord God.
026	EZE	036	015	And there shall no more be heard against you the reproach of the nations, and ye shall no more bear the revilings of the peoples, saith the Lord God.
026	EZE	036	016	And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
026	EZE	036	017	Son of man, the house of Israel dwelt upon their land, and defiled it by their way, and with their idols, and with their uncleannesses; and their way was before me like the uncleanness of a removed woman.
026	EZE	036	018	So I poured out my wrath upon them:
026	EZE	036	019	and I dispersed them among the nations, and utterly scattered them through the countries: I judged them according to their way and according to their sin.
026	EZE	036	020	And they went in among the nations, among which they went, and they profaned my holy name, while it was said of them, These are the people of the Lord, and they came forth out of his land.
026	EZE	036	021	But I spared them for the sake of my holy name, which the house of Israel profaned among the nations, among whom they went.
026	EZE	036	022	Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord; I do not this, O house of Israel, for your sakes, but because of my holy name, which ye have profaned among the nations, among whom ye went.
026	EZE	036	023	And I will sanctify my great name, which was profaned among the nations, which ye profaned in the midst of them; and the nations shall know that I am the Lord, when I am sanctified among you before their eyes.
026	EZE	036	024	And I will take you out from the nations, and will gather you out of all the lands, and will bring you into your own land:
026	EZE	036	025	and I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be purged from all your uncleannesses, and from all your idols, and I will cleanse you.
026	EZE	036	026	And I will give you a new heart, and will put a new spirit in you: and I will take away the heart of stone out of your flesh, and will give you a heart of flesh.
026	EZE	036	027	And I will put my Spirit in you, and will cause you to walk in mine ordinances, and to keep my judgments, and do [them].
026	EZE	036	028	And ye shall dwell upon the land which I gave to your fathers; and ye shall be to me a people, and I will be to you a God.
026	EZE	036	029	And I will save you from all your uncleannesses: and I will call for the corn, and multiply it, and will not bring famine upon you.
026	EZE	036	030	And I will multiply the fruit of the trees, and the produce of the field, that ye may not bear the reproach of famine among the nations.
026	EZE	036	031	And ye shall remember your evil ways and your practices that were not good, and ye shall be hateful in your own sight for your transgressions and for your abominations.
026	EZE	036	032	Not for your sakes do I [this], saith the Lord God, [as] it is known to you: be ye ashamed and confounded for your ways, O house of Israel.
026	EZE	036	033	Thus saith the Lord God; In the day wherein I shall cleanse you from all your iniquities I will also cause the cities to be inhabited, and the waste [places] shall be built upon:
026	EZE	036	034	and the desolate land shall be cultivated, whereas it was desolate in the eyes of every one that passed by.
026	EZE	036	035	And they shall say, That desolate land is become like a garden of delight; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are inhabited.
026	EZE	036	036	And the nations, as many as shall have been left round about you, shall know that I the Lord have built the ruined [cities] and planted the waste [lands]: I the Lord have spoken, and will do [it].
026	EZE	036	037	Thus saith the Lord God; Yet [for] this will I be sought by the house of Israel, to establish them; I will multiply them [even] men as sheep;
026	EZE	036	038	as holy sheep, as the sheep of Jerusalem in her feasts; thus shall the desert cities be full of flocks of men: and they shall know that I [am] the Lord.
026	EZE	037	001	And the hand of the Lord came upon me, and the Lord brought me forth by the Spirit, and set me in the midst of the plain, and it was full of human bones.
026	EZE	037	002	And he led me round about them every way: and, behold, [there were] very many on the face of the plain, very dry.
026	EZE	037	003	And he said to me, Son of man, will these bones live? and I said, O Lord God, thou knowest this.
026	EZE	037	004	And he said to me, Prophesy upon these bones, and thou shalt say to them, Ye dry bones, hear the word of the Lord.
026	EZE	037	005	Thus saith the Lord to these bones; Behold, I [will] bring upon you the breath of life:
026	EZE	037	006	and I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and will spread skin upon you, and will put my Spirit into you, and ye shall live; and ye shall know that I am the Lord.
026	EZE	037	007	So I prophesied as [the Lord] commanded me: and it came to pass while I was prophesying, that, behold, [there was] a shaking, and the bones approached each one to his joint.
026	EZE	037	008	And I looked, and behold, sinews and flesh grew upon them, and skin came upon them above: but there was not breath in them.
026	EZE	037	009	And he said to me, Prophesy to the wind, prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord; Come from the four winds, and breathe upon these dead [men], and let them live.
026	EZE	037	010	So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath entered into them, and they lived, and stood upon their feet, a very great congregation.
026	EZE	037	011	And the Lord spoke to me, saying, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel: and they say, Our bones are become dry, our hope has perished, we are quite spent.
026	EZE	037	012	Therefore prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord; Behold, I [will] open your tombs, and will bring you up out of your tombs, and will bring you into the land of Israel.
026	EZE	037	013	And ye shall know that I am the Lord, when I have opened your graves, that I may bring up my people from [their] graves.
026	EZE	037	014	And I will put my Spirit within you, and ye shall live, and I will place you upon your own land: and ye shall know that I [am] the Lord; I have spoken, and will do [it], saith the Lord.
026	EZE	037	015	And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
026	EZE	037	016	Son of man, take for thyself a rod, and write upon it, Juda, and the children of Israel his adherents; and thou shalt take for thyself another rod, and thou shalt inscribe it for Joseph, the rod of Ephraim, and all the children of Israel that belong to him.
026	EZE	037	017	And thou shalt joint them together for thyself, so as that they should bind themselves into one stick; and they shall be in thine hand.
026	EZE	037	018	And it shall come to pass, when the children of thy people shall say to thee, Wilt thou not tell us what thou meanest by these things?
026	EZE	037	019	Then shalt thou say to them, Thus saith the Lord; behold, I will take the tribe of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel that belong to him, and I will add them to the tribe of Juda, and they shall become one rod in the hand of Juda.
026	EZE	037	020	And the rods on which thou didst write shall be in thine hand in their presence.
026	EZE	037	021	And thou shalt say to them, Thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I [will] take the whole house of Israel out of the midst of the nations, among whom they have gone, and I will gather them from all that are round about them, and I will bring them into the land of Israel.
026	EZE	037	022	And I will make them a nation in my land, even on the mountains of Israel; and they shall have one prince: and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided any more at all into two kingdoms:
026	EZE	037	023	that they may no more defile themselves with their idols; and I will deliver them from all their transgressions whereby they have sinned, and will cleanse them; and they shall be to me a people, and I the Lord will be to them a God.
026	EZE	037	024	And my servant David [shall be] a prince in the midst of them: there shall be one shepherd of [them] all; for they shall walk in mine ordinances, and keep my judgments, and do them.
026	EZE	037	025	And they shall dwell in their land, which I have given to my servant Jacob, where their fathers dwelt; and they shall dwell upon it: and David my servant [shall be their] prince forever.
026	EZE	037	026	And I will make with them a covenant of peace; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them; and I will establish my sanctuary in the midst of them for ever.
026	EZE	037	027	And my tabernacle shall be among them; and I will be to them a God, and they shall be my people.
026	EZE	037	028	And the nations shall know that I am the Lord that sanctifies them, when my sanctuary is in the midst of them for ever.
026	EZE	038	001	And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
026	EZE	038	002	Son of man, set thy face against Gog, and the land of Magog, Rhos, prince of Mesoch and Thobel, and prophesy against him,
026	EZE	038	003	and say to him, Thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I am against thee, Rhos prince of Mesoch and Thobel:
026	EZE	038	004	and I will gather thee, and all thine host, horses and horsemen, all wearing breast-plates, with a great multitude, shields and helmets and swords:
026	EZE	038	005	Persians, and Ethiopians, and Libyans; all with helmets and shields.
026	EZE	038	006	Gomer, and all belonging to him; the house of Thorgama, from the end of the north, and all belonging to him; and many nations with thee.
026	EZE	038	007	Be thou prepared, prepare thyself, thou, and all thy multitude that is assembled with thee, and thou shalt be to me for a guard.
026	EZE	038	008	He shall be prepared after many days, and he shall come at the end of years, and shall come to a land that is brought back from the sword, when [the people] are gathered from many nations against the land of Israel, which was entirely desolate: and he is come forth out of the nations, and they shall all dwell securely.
026	EZE	038	009	And thou shalt go up as rain, and shalt arrive as a cloud to cover the land, and there shall be thou, and all that are about thee, and many nations with thee.
026	EZE	038	010	Thus saith the Lord God; It shall also come to pass in that day, that thoughts shall come up into thine heart, and thou shalt devise evil devices.
026	EZE	038	011	And thou shalt say, I will go up to the rejected land; I will come upon them that are at ease in tranquility, and dwelling in peace, all inhabiting a land in which there is no wall, nor bars, nor have they doors;
026	EZE	038	012	to seize plunder, and to take their spoil; to turn my hands against the desolate land that is [now] inhabited, and against a nation that is gathered from many nations, that have acquired property, dwelling in the midst of the land.
026	EZE	038	013	Sabba, and Daedan, and Carthaginian merchants, and all their villages shall say to thee, Thou art come for plunder to take a prey, and to get spoils: thou hast gathered thy multitude to take silver and gold, to carry off property, to take spoils.
026	EZE	038	014	Therefore prophesy, son of man, and say to Gog, Thus saith the Lord; Wilt thou not arise in that day, when my people Israel are dwelling securely,
026	EZE	038	015	and come out of thy place from the farthest north, and many nations with thee? all of them mounted on horses, a great gathering, and a large force?
026	EZE	038	016	And thou shalt come up upon my people Israel as a cloud to cover the land; it shall come to pass in the last days, that I will bring thee up upon my land, that all the nations may know me, when I am sanctified in thee before them.
026	EZE	038	017	Thus saith the Lord God, to Gog; Thou art [he] concerning whom I spoke in former times, by the hand of my servants the prophets of Israel, in those days and years, that I would bring thee up against them.
026	EZE	038	018	And it shall come to pass in that day, in the day when Gog shall come against the land of Israel, saith the Lord God,
026	EZE	038	019	[that] my wrath and my jealousy shall arise, I have spoken in the fire of mine anger, verily in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of Israel;
026	EZE	038	020	and the fish of the sea shall quake at the presence of the Lord, and the birds of the sky and the wild beasts of the field, and all the reptiles that creep upon the earth, and all the men that are on the face of the earth; and the mountains shall be rent, and the valleys shall fall, and every wall on the land shall fall.
026	EZE	038	021	And I will summon against it even every fear, saith the Lord: the sword of [every] man shall be against his brother.
026	EZE	038	022	And I will judge him with pestilence, and blood, and sweeping rain, and hailstones; and I will rain upon him fire and brimstone, and upon all that are with him, and upon many nations with him.
026	EZE	038	023	And I will be magnified, and sanctified, and glorified; and I will be known in the presence of many nations, and they shall know that I am the Lord.
026	EZE	039	001	And thou, son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say, Thus saith the Lord; Behold, I am against thee, O Gog, Rhos prince of Mesoch and Thobel:
026	EZE	039	002	and I will assemble thee, and guide thee, and raise thee up on the extremity of the north, and I will bring thee up upon the mountains of Israel.
026	EZE	039	003	And I will destroy the bow out of thy left hand, and thine arrows out of thy right hand, and I will cast thee down on the mountains of Israel;
026	EZE	039	004	and thou and all that belong to thee shall fall, and the nations that are with thee shall be given to multitudes of birds, [even] to every fowl, and I have given thee to all the wild beasts of the field to be devoured.
026	EZE	039	005	Thou shalt fall on the face of the field: for I have spoken [it], saith the Lord.
026	EZE	039	006	And I will send a fire upon Gog, and the islands shall be securely inhabited: and they shall know that I am the Lord.
026	EZE	039	007	And my holy name shall be known in the midst of my people Israel; and my holy name shall no more be profaned: and the nations shall know that I am the Lord, the Holy [One] in Israel.
026	EZE	039	008	Behold it is come, and thou shalt know that it shall be, saith the Lord God; this is the day concerning which I have spoken.
026	EZE	039	009	And they that inhabit the cities of Israel shall come forth, and make a fire with the arms, the shields and the spears, and bows and arrows, and hand-staves, and lances, and they shall keep fire burning with them for seven years:
026	EZE	039	010	and they shall not take any wood out of the field, neither shall they cut any out of the forests, but they shall burn the weapons with fire: and they shall plunder those that plundered them, and spoil those that spoiled them, saith the Lord.
026	EZE	039	011	And it shall come to pass [that] in that day I will give to Gog a place of renown, a tomb in Israel, the burial-place of them that approach the sea: and they shall build round about the outlet of the valley, and there they shall bury Gog and all his multitude: and [the place] shall then be called the burial-place of Gog.
026	EZE	039	012	And the house of Israel shall bury them, that the land may be cleansed in the space of seven months.
026	EZE	039	013	Yea, all the people of the land shall bury them; and it shall be to them a [place] of renown in the day wherein it was glorified, saith the Lord.
026	EZE	039	014	And they shall appoint men continually to go over the land, to bury them that have been left on the face of the earth, to cleanse it after the space of seven months, and they shall seek [them] out.
026	EZE	039	015	And every one that goes through the land, and sees a man's bone, shall set up a mark by it, until the buriers shall have buried it in the valley, the burial place of Gog.
026	EZE	039	016	For the name of the city [shall be] Burial-place: so shall the land be cleansed.
026	EZE	039	017	And thou, son of man, say, Thus saith the Lord; Say to every winged bird, and to all the wild beasts of the field, Gather yourselves, and come; gather yourselves from all [places] round about to my sacrifice, which I have made for you, [even] a great sacrifice on the mountains of Israel, and ye shall eat flesh, and drink blood.
026	EZE	039	018	Ye shall eat the flesh of mighty men, and ye shall drink the blood of princes of the earth, rams, and calves and goats, and they are all fatted calves.
026	EZE	039	019	And ye shall eat fat till ye are full, and shall drink wine till ye are drunken, of my sacrifice which I have prepared for you.
026	EZE	039	020	And ye shall be filled at my table, [eating] horse, and rider, and mighty man, and every warrior, saith the Lord.
026	EZE	039	021	And I will set my glory among you, and all the nations shall see my judgment which I have wrought, and my hand which I have brought upon them.
026	EZE	039	022	And the house of Israel shall know that I am the Lord their God, from this day and onwards.
026	EZE	039	023	And all the nations shall know that the house of Israel were led captive because of their sins, because they rebelled against me, and I turned away my face from them, and delivered them into the hands of their enemies, and they all fell by the sword.
026	EZE	039	024	According to their uncleannesses and according to their transgressions did I deal with them, and I turned away my face from them.
026	EZE	039	025	Therefore thus saith the Lord God, Now will I turn back captivity in Jacob, and will have mercy on the house of Israel, and will be jealous for the sake of my holy name.
026	EZE	039	026	And they shall bear their reproach, and the iniquity which they committed when they dwelt upon their land in peace. Yet there shall be none to terrify [them]
026	EZE	039	027	when I have brought them back from the nations, and gathered them out of the countries of the nations: and I will be sanctified among them in the presence of the nations.
026	EZE	039	028	And they shall know that I am the Lord their God, when I have been manifested to them among the nations.
026	EZE	039	029	And I will no more turn away my face from them, because I have poured out my wrath upon the house of Israel, saith the Lord God.
026	EZE	040	001	And it came to pass in the twenty-fifth year of our captivity, in the first month, on the tenth [day] of the month, in the fourteenth year after the taking of the city, in that day the hand of the Lord was upon me, and brought me
026	EZE	040	002	in a vision of God into the land of Israel, and set me on a very high mountain, and upon it [there was] as it were the frame of a city before [me].
026	EZE	040	003	And he brought me in thither, and, behold, [there was] a man, and the appearance of him was as the appearance of shining brass, and in his hand was a builder's line, and a measuring reed; and he stood at the gate.
026	EZE	040	004	And the man said to me, Look with thine eyes at him whom thou hast seen, son of man, and hear with thine ears, and lay up in thine heart all things that I show thee; for thou hast come in hither that [I] might show thee, and thou shalt show all things that thou seest to the house of Israel.
026	EZE	040	005	And behold a wall round about the house without, and in the man's hand a reed, the measure [of it was] six cubits by the cubit, and a span: and he measured across the front wall; the breadth was equal to the reed, and the length of it equal to the reed.
026	EZE	040	006	And he entered by seven steps into the gate that looks eastward, and he measured across the porch of the gate equal to the reed.
026	EZE	040	007	And the chamber was equal in length to the reed, and equal in breadth to the reed; and the porch between the chambers six cubits; and the second chamber equal in breadth to the reed, and equal in length to the reed, and the porch five cubits.
026	EZE	040	008	And the third chamber equal in length to the reed, and equal in breadth to the reed.
026	EZE	040	009	And the porch of the gateway (near the porch of the gate) eight cubits; and the posts there of two cubits; and the porch of the gate was inward:
026	EZE	040	010	and the chambers of the gate of the chamber in front [were] three on one side and three on the other, and [there was] one measure to the three: [there was] one measure to the porches on this side and on that.
026	EZE	040	011	And he measured the breadth of the door of the gateway, ten cubits; and the breadth of the gateway thirteen cubits.
026	EZE	040	012	And the space before the chambers was narrowed to a cubit in front of the chambers on this side and on that side: and the chamber was six cubits this way, and six cubits that way.
026	EZE	040	013	And he measured the gate from the wall of one chamber to the wall of the other chamber: the breadth was twenty-five cubits, the one gate over against the other gate.
026	EZE	040	014	And the open space of the porch of the gate without, was twenty cubits to the chambers round about the gate.
026	EZE	040	015	And the open space of the gate without to the open space of the porch of the gate within was fifty cubits.
026	EZE	040	016	And [there were] secret windows to the chambers, and to the porches within the gate of the court round about, and in the same manner windows to the porches round about within: and on the porch [there were] palm-trees on this side and on that side.
026	EZE	040	017	And he brought me into the inner court, and, behold, [there were] chambers, and peristyles round about the court; thirty chambers within the ranges of columns.
026	EZE	040	018	And the porticos were behind the gates; according to the length of the gates, was the lower peristyle.
026	EZE	040	019	And he measured the breadth of the court, from the open space of the outer gate inwards to the open space of the gate looking outwards: a hundred cubits [was the distance to the place] of the gate looking eastward: and he brought me to the north;
026	EZE	040	020	and behold a gate looking northwards [belonging to] the outer court, and he measured it, both the length of it and the breadth;
026	EZE	040	021	and the chambers, three on this side and three on that; and the posts, and the porches, and the palm-trees thereof: and they were according to the measures of the gate that looks eastward: the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth thereof was twenty-five cubits.
026	EZE	040	022	And its windows, and its porches, and its palm-trees, were according to [the dimensions of] the gate looking eastward; and they went up to it by seven steps; and the porches were within.
026	EZE	040	023	And [there was] a gate to the inner court looking toward the north gate, after the manner of the gate looking toward the east; and he measured the court from gate to gate, a hundred cubits.
026	EZE	040	024	And he brought me to the south side, and behold a gate looking southwards: and he measured it, and its chambers, and its posts, and its porches, according to these dimensions.
026	EZE	040	025	And its windows and its porches round about were according to the windows of the porch: the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth thereof was five and twenty cubits.
026	EZE	040	026	And it had seven steps, and porches within: and it [had] palm-trees on the posts, one on one side, and one on the other side.
026	EZE	040	027	And [there was] a gate opposite the gate of the inner court southward: and he measured the court from gate to gate, a hundred cubits in breadth southward.
026	EZE	040	028	And he brought me into the inner court of the south gate: and he measured the gate according to these measures;
026	EZE	040	029	and the chambers, and the posts,
026	EZE	040	030	and the porches, according to these measures: and [there were] windows to it and to the porches round about: its length was fifty cubits, and [its] breadth twenty-five cubits,
026	EZE	040	031	from the porch to the outer court: and [there were] palm-trees to the post [thereof], and eight steps.
026	EZE	040	032	And he brought me in at the gate that looks eastward: and he measured it according to these measures:
026	EZE	040	033	and the chambers, and the posts, and the porches according to these measures: and [there were] windows to it, and porches round about: the length of it was fifty cubits, and the breadth of it twenty-five cubits.
026	EZE	040	034	And [there were] porches [opening] into the inner court, and palm-trees on the posts on this side and on that side: and it [had] eight steps.
026	EZE	040	035	And he brought me in at the northern gate, and measured [it] according to these measures;
026	EZE	040	036	and the chambers, and the posts, and the porches: and it [had] windows round about, and [it had] its porches: the length of it was fifty cubits, and the breadth twenty-five cubits.
026	EZE	040	037	And its porches were toward the inner court; and [there were] palm-trees to the posts on this side and on that side: and it [had] eight steps.
026	EZE	040	038	Its chambers and its door-ways, and its porches at the second gate [served as] a drain,
026	EZE	040	039	that they might slay in it the sin-offerings, and the trespass-offerings.
026	EZE	040	040	And behind the drain for the whole-burnt-offerings at the north [gate], two tables eastward behind the second gate; and [behind] the porch of the gate two tables eastward.
026	EZE	040	041	Four on one side and four on the other side behind the gate; upon them they kill the victims, in front of the eight tables of sacrifices.
026	EZE	040	042	And [there were] four tables of hewn stone for whole-burnt-offerings, the breadth [of them was] a cubit and a half, and the length [of them] two cubits [and] a half, and [their] height was a cubit: on them they shall place the instruments with which they slay there the whole-burnt-offerings and the victims.
026	EZE	040	043	And they shall have within a border of hewn stone round about of a span broad, and over the tables above screens for covering [them] from the wet and from the heat.
026	EZE	040	044	And he brought me into the inner court, and behold [there were] two chambers in the inner court, one behind the gate looking to the north, turning southward, and one behind the southern gate, but which looks to the north.
026	EZE	040	045	And he said to me, This chamber that looks to the south, is for the priests that keep the charge of the house.
026	EZE	040	046	And the chamber that looks to the north is for the priests that keep the charge of the altar: they are the sons of Sadduc, those of the tribe of Levi who draw near to the Lord to serve him.
026	EZE	040	047	And he measured the court, the length [whereof was] a hundred cubits, and the breadth a hundred cubits, on its four sides; and the altar in front of the house.
026	EZE	040	048	And he brought me into the porch of the house; and he measured the post of the porch, the breadth was five cubits on one side and five cubits on the other side; and the breadth of the door [was] fourteen cubits, and the side-pieces of the door of the porch [were] three cubits on one side, and three cubits on the other side.
026	EZE	040	049	And the length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth twelve cubits; and they went up to it by ten steps; and [there were] pillars to the porch, one on this side and one on that side.
026	EZE	041	001	And he brought me into the temple, the porch of which he measured, six cubits the breadth on one side, and six cubits the breadth of the porch on the other side.
026	EZE	041	002	And the breadth of the gateway was ten cubits, and the side-pieces of the gateway were five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side: and he measured the length of it, forty cubits, and the breadth, twenty cubits.
026	EZE	041	003	And he went into the inner court, and measured the post of the door, two cubits; and the door, six cubits; and the side-pieces of the door, seven cubits on one side, and seven cubits on the other side.
026	EZE	041	004	And he measured the length of the doors, forty cubits; and the breadth, twenty cubits, in front of the temple: and he said, This is the holy of holies.
026	EZE	041	005	And he measured the wall of the house, six cubits: and the breadth of [each] side, four cubits round about.
026	EZE	041	006	And the sides were twice ninety, side against side; and [there was] a space in the wall of the house at the sides round about, that they should be for them that take hold of them to see, that they should not at all touch the walls of the house.
026	EZE	041	007	And the breadth of the upper side [was made] according to the projection out of the wall, against the upper one round about the house, that it might be enlarged above, and that [men] might go up to the upper chambers from those below, and from the ground-sills to the third story.
026	EZE	041	008	And as for the height of the house round about, [each] space between the sides was equal to a reed of six cubits;
026	EZE	041	009	and the breadth of the wall of each side without was five cubits; and the spaces that were left between the sides of the house,
026	EZE	041	010	and between the chambers, were a width of twenty cubits, the circumference of the house.
026	EZE	041	011	And the doors of the chambers were toward the space left by the one door that looked northward, and [there was] one door southward; and the breadth of the remaining open space [was] five cubits in extent round about.
026	EZE	041	012	And the partition [wall] in front of the remaining space, toward the west, was seventy cubits in breadth; the breadth of the partition wall was five cubits round about, and the length of it ninety cubits.
026	EZE	041	013	And he measured in front of the house a length of a hundred cubits, and the remaining spaces and the partitions; and the walls thereof were in length a hundred cubits.
026	EZE	041	014	And the breadth in front of the house, and the remaining [spaces] before [it were] a hundred cubits.
026	EZE	041	015	And he measured the length of the partition in front of the space left by the back parts of that house; and the [spaces] left on this side and on that side were in length a hundred cubits: and the temple and the corners and the outer porch were ceiled.
026	EZE	041	016	And the windows were latticed, [giving] light round about to the three [stories], so as to look through: and the house and the parts adjoining were planked round about, and [so was] the floor, and from the floor up to the windows, and the window [shutters] folded back in three parts for one to look through.
026	EZE	041	017	And almost all the way to the inner, and close to the outer [side], and upon all the wall round about within and without,
026	EZE	041	018	were carved cherubs and palm-trees between the cherubs, [and each] cherub [had] two faces.
026	EZE	041	019	The face of a man was toward one palm-tree on this side and on that side, and the face of a lion toward another palm-tree on this side and on that side: the house was carved all round.
026	EZE	041	020	From the floor to the ceiling were cherubs and palm-trees carved.
026	EZE	041	021	And the holy place and the temple opened on four sides; in front of the holy places the appearance was as the look of
026	EZE	041	022	a wooden altar, the height of it three cubits, and the length two cubits, and the breadth two cubits; and it had horns, and the base of it and the sides of it were of wood: and he said to me, This is the table, which is before the face of the Lord.
026	EZE	041	023	And the temple [had] two doors, and the sanctuary [had] two doors, with two turning leaves [apiece];
026	EZE	041	024	two leaves to the one, and two leaves to the other door.
026	EZE	041	025	And [there was] carved work upon them, and cherubs on the doors of the temple, and palm-trees according to the carving of the sanctuary; and [there were] stout planks in front of the porch without.
026	EZE	041	026	And [there were] secret windows; and he measured from side to side, to the roofing of the porch; and the sides of the house were closely planked.
026	EZE	042	001	And he brought me into the inner court eastward, opposite the northern gate: and he brought me in, and behold five chambers near the vacant space, and near the northern partition,
026	EZE	042	002	a hundred cubits in length toward the north, and in breadth fifty,
026	EZE	042	003	ornamented accordingly as the gates of the inner court, and arranged accordingly as the peristyles of the outer court, [with] triple porticos fronting one another.
026	EZE	042	004	And in front of the chambers was a walk ten cubits in breadth, the length [reaching] to a hundred cubits; and their doors were northward.
026	EZE	042	005	And the upper walks were in like manner: for the peristyle projected from it, [even] from the range of columns below, and [there was] a space between; so [were there] a peristyle and a space between, and so [were there] two porticos.
026	EZE	042	006	For they were triple, and they had not pillars like the pillars of the outer ones: therefore they projected from the lower ones and the middle ones from the ground.
026	EZE	042	007	And [there was] light without, corresponding to the chambers of the outer court looking toward the front of the northern chambers; the length [of them was] fifty cubits.
026	EZE	042	008	For the length of the chambers looking toward the inner court was fifty cubits, and these are the ones that front the others; the whole was a hundred cubits.
026	EZE	042	009	And [there were] doors of these chambers for an outlet toward the east, so that one should go through them out of the outer court,
026	EZE	042	010	by the opening of the walk at the corner; and the south parts were toward the south, toward the remaining space, and toward the partition, and [so were] the chambers.
026	EZE	042	011	And the walk was in front of them, according to the measures of the chambers toward the north, both according to the length of them, and according to the breadth of them, and according to all their openings, an according to all their turnings, and according to their lights, and according to their doors.
026	EZE	042	012	[So were the measures] of the chambers toward the south, and according to the doors at the entrance of the walk, as it were the distance of a reed for light, and eastward as one went in by them.
026	EZE	042	013	And he said to me, The chambers toward the north, and the chambers toward the south, in front of the void spaces, these are the chambers of the sanctuary, wherein the priests the sons of Sadduc, who draw night to the Lord, shall eat the most holy things: and there shall they lay the most holy things, and the meat-offering, and the sin-offerings, and the trespass-offerings; because the place is holy.
026	EZE	042	014	None shall go in thither except the priests, [and] they shall not go forth of the holy place into the outer court, that they that draw nigh [to me] may be continually holy, and may not touch their garments in which they minister, [with defilement], for they are holy; and they shall put on other garments whenever they come in contact with the people.
026	EZE	042	015	So the measurement of the house within was accomplished: and he brought me forth by the way of the gate that looks eastward, and measured the plan of the house round about in order.
026	EZE	042	016	And he stood behind the gate looking eastward, and measured five hundred [cubits] with the measuring reed.
026	EZE	042	017	And he turned to the north and measured in front of the north [side] five hundred cubits with the measuring reed.
026	EZE	042	018	And he turned to the west, and measured in front of the west side, five hundred [cubits] with the measuring reed.
026	EZE	042	019	And he turned to the south, and measured in front of the south side, five hundred [cubits] by the measuring reed.
026	EZE	042	020	The [four sides he measured] by the same reed, and he marked out the house and the circumference of the parts round about, [a space] of five hundred [cubits] eastward, and a breadth of five hundred cubits, to make a division between the sanctuary and the outer wall, that [belonged to] the design of the house.
026	EZE	043	001	Moreover he brought me to the gate looking eastward, and led me forth.
026	EZE	043	002	And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel came by the eastern way; and [there was] a voice of an army, as the sound of many redoubling [their shouts], and the earth shone like light from the glory round about.
026	EZE	043	003	And the vision which I saw was like the vision which I saw when I went in to anoint the city: and the vision of the chariot which I saw was like the vision which I saw at the river Chobar; and I fell upon my face.
026	EZE	043	004	And the glory of the Lord came into the house, by the way of the gate looking eastward.
026	EZE	043	005	And the Spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court; and, behold, the house of the Lord was full of glory.
026	EZE	043	006	And I stood, and behold [there was] a voice out of the house of one speaking to me, and a man stood near me,
026	EZE	043	007	and he said to me, Son of man, thou hast seen the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, in which my name shall dwell in the midst of the house of Israel for ever; and the house of Israel shall no more profane my holy name, they and their princes, by their fornication, or by the murders of [their] princes in the midst of them;
026	EZE	043	008	when they set my door-way by their door-way, and my thresholds near to their thresholds: and they made my wall as it were joining myself and them, and they profaned my holy name with their iniquities which they wrought: and I destroyed them in my wrath and with slaughter.
026	EZE	043	009	And now let them put away from me their fornication, and the murders of their princes, and I will dwell in the midst of them forever.
026	EZE	043	010	And thou, son of man, shew the house to the house of Israel, that they may cease from their sins; and [shew] its aspect and the arrangement of it.
026	EZE	043	011	And they shall bear their punishment for all the things that they have done: and thou shalt describe the house, and its entrances, and the plan thereof, and all its ordinances, and thou shalt make known to them all the regulations of it, and describe [them] before them: and they shall keep all my commandments, and all my ordinances, and do them.
026	EZE	043	012	And thou shalt shew the plan of the house on the top of the mountain: all its limits round about [shall be] most holy.
026	EZE	043	013	And these are the measures of the altar by the cubit of a cubit and a span, the cavity [shall be] a cubit deep, and a cubit shall be the breadth, and the border on the rim of it round about shall be a span: and this [shall be] the height of the altar
026	EZE	043	014	from the bottom at the commencement of the hollow part to this great mercy-seat, from beneath was two cubits, and the breadth was a cubit; and from the little mercy-seat to the great mercy-seat, four cubits, and the breadth was a cubit.
026	EZE	043	015	And the altar [shall be] four cubits; and from the altar and above the horns a cubit.
026	EZE	043	016	And the altar [shall be] of the length of twelve cubits, by twelve cubits [in breadth], square upon its four sides.
026	EZE	043	017	And the mercy-seat [shall be] fourteen cubits in length, by fourteen cubits in breadth on its four sides; and [there shall be] a border to it carried round about it of half a cubit; and the rim of it [shall be] a cubit round about; and the steps thereof looking eastward.
026	EZE	043	018	And he said to me, Son of man, thus saith the Lord God of Israel; These are the ordinances of the altar in the day of its being made, to offer upon it whole-burnt-offerings, and to pour blood upon it.
026	EZE	043	019	And thou shalt appoint to the priests the Levites of the seed of Sadduc, that draw nigh to me, saith the Lord God, to minister to me, a calf of the herd for a sin-offering.
026	EZE	043	020	And they shall take of its blood, and shall put [it] on the four horns of the altar, and upon the four corners of the propitiatory, and upon the base round about, and they shall make atonement for it.
026	EZE	043	021	And they shall take the calf of the sin-offering, and it shall be consumed by fire in the separate place of the house, outside the sanctuary.
026	EZE	043	022	And on the second day they shall take two kids of the goats without blemish for a sin-offering; and they shall make atonement for the altar, as they made atonement with the calf.
026	EZE	043	023	And after they have finished the atonement, they shall bring an unblemished calf of the herd, and an unblemished ram of the flock.
026	EZE	043	024	And ye shall offer [them] before the Lord, and the priests shall sprinkle salt upon them, and shall offer them up [as] whole-burnt-offerings to the Lord.
026	EZE	043	025	Seven days shalt thou offer a kid daily for a sin-offering, and a calf of the herd, and a ram out of the flock: they shall sacrifice them unblemished for seven days:
026	EZE	043	026	and they shall make atonement for the altar, and shall purge it; and they shall consecrate themselves.
026	EZE	043	027	And it shall come to pass from the eighth day and onward, [that] the priests shall offer your whole-burnt-offerings on the altar, and your peace-offerings; and I will accept you, saith the Lord.
026	EZE	044	001	Then he brought me back by the way of the outer gate of the sanctuary that looks eastward; and it was shut.
026	EZE	044	002	And the Lord said to me, This gate shall be shut, it shall not be opened, and no one shall pass through it; for the Lord God of Israel shall enter by it, and it shall be shut.
026	EZE	044	003	For the prince, he shall sit in it, to eat bread before the Lord; he shall go in by the way of the porch of the gate, and shall go forth by the way of the same.
026	EZE	044	004	And he brought me in by the way of the gate that looks northward, in front of the house: and I looked, and, behold, the house was full of the glory of the Lord: and I fell upon my face.
026	EZE	044	005	And the Lord said to me, Son of man, attend with thine heart, and see with [thine] eyes, and hear with thine ears all that I say to thee, according to all the ordinances of the house of the Lord, and all the regulations thereof; and thou shalt attend well to the entrance of the house, according to all its outlets, in all the holy things.
026	EZE	044	006	And thou shalt say to the provoking house, [even] to the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord God; Let it suffice you [to have committed] all your iniquities, O house of Israel!
026	EZE	044	007	that ye have brought in aliens, uncircumcised in heart, and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary, and to profane it, when ye offered bread, flesh, and blood; and ye transgressed my covenant by all your iniquities;
026	EZE	044	008	and ye appointed [others] to keep the charges in my sanctuary.
026	EZE	044	009	Therefore thus saith the Lord God; No alien, uncircumcised in heart or uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary, of all the children of strangers that are in the midst of the house of Israel.
026	EZE	044	010	But as for the Levites who departed far from me when Israel went astray from me after their imaginations, they shall even bear their iniquity.
026	EZE	044	011	yet they shall minister in my sanctuary, [being] porters at the gates of the house, and serving the house: they shall slay the victims and the whole-burnt-offerings for the people, and they shall stand before the people to minister to them.
026	EZE	044	012	Because they ministered to them before their idols, and it became to the house of Israel a punishment of iniquity; therefore have I lifted up my hand against them, saith the Lord God.
026	EZE	044	013	And they shall not draw nigh to me to minister to me in the priests' office, nor to approach the holy things of the children of Israel, nor [to approach] my holy of holies: but they shall bear their reproach for the error wherein they erred.
026	EZE	044	014	They shall bring them to keep the charges of the house, for all the service of it, and for all that they shall do.
026	EZE	044	015	The priests the Levites, the sons of Sadduc, who kept the charges of my sanctuary when the house of Israel went astray from me, these shall draw night to me to minister to me, and shall stand before my face, to offer sacrifice to me, the fat and the blood, saith the Lord God.
026	EZE	044	016	These shall enter into my sanctuary, and these shall approach my table, to minister to me, and they shall keep my charges.
026	EZE	044	017	And it shall come to pass when they enter the gates of the inner court, [that] they shall put on linen robes; and they shall not put on woollen garments when they minister at the gate of the inner court.
026	EZE	044	018	And they shall have linen mitres upon their heads, and shall have linen drawers upon their loins; and they shall not tightly gird themselves.
026	EZE	044	019	And when they go out into the outer court to the people, they shall put off their robes, in which they minister; and they shall lay them up in the chambers of the sanctuary, and shall put on other robes, and they shall not sanctify the people with their robes.
026	EZE	044	020	And they shall not shave their heads, nor shall they pluck off their hair; they shall carefully cover their heads.
026	EZE	044	021	And no priest shall drink any wine, when they go into the inner court.
026	EZE	044	022	Neither shall they take to themselves to wife a widow, or one that is put away, but a virgin of the seed of Israel: but if there should happen to be a priest's widow, they shall take [her].
026	EZE	044	023	And they shall teach my people [to distinguish] between holy and profane, and they shall make known to them [the difference] between unclean and clean.
026	EZE	044	024	And these shall attend at a judgment of blood to decide it: they shall rightly observe my ordinances, and judge my judgments, and keep my statutes and my commandments in all my feasts; and they shall hallow my sabbaths.
026	EZE	044	025	And they shall not go in to the dead body of a man to defile themselves: only [a priest] may defile himself for a father, or for a mother, or for a son, or for a daughter, or for a brother, or for his sister, who has not been married.
026	EZE	044	026	And after he has been cleansed, let him number to himself seven days.
026	EZE	044	027	And on whatsoever day they shall enter into the inner court to minister in the holy place, they shall bring a propitiation, saith the Lord God.
026	EZE	044	028	And it shall be to them for an inheritance: I am their inheritance: and no possession shall be given them among the children of Israel; for I am their possession.
026	EZE	044	029	And these shall eat the meat-offerings, and the sin-offerings, and the trespass-offerings; and every special offering in Israel shall be theirs.
026	EZE	044	030	[And] the first-fruits of all things, and the first-born of all [animals] and all offerings, of all your first-fruits there shall be [a share] for the priests; and ye shall give your earliest produce to the priest, to bring your blessings upon your houses.
026	EZE	044	031	And the priests shall eat no bird or beast that dies of itself, or is taken of wild beasts.
026	EZE	045	001	And when ye measure the land for inheritance, ye shall set apart first-fruits to the Lord, a holy space of the land, in length twenty and five thousand [reeds], and in breadth twenty thousand; it shall be holy in all the borders thereof round about.
026	EZE	045	002	And there shall be a sanctuary out of this, five hundred [reeds in length] by five hundred in breadth, a square round about; and [there shall be] a vacant space [beyond] this of fifty cubits round about.
026	EZE	045	003	And out of this measurement shalt thou measure the length five and twenty thousand, and the breadth twenty thousand: and in it shall be the holy of holies.
026	EZE	045	004	Of the land shall be [a portion] for the priests that minister in the holy place, and it shall be for them that draw nigh to minister to the Lord: and it shall be to them a place for houses set apart for their sacred office;
026	EZE	045	005	the length [shall be] twenty-five thousand, and the breadth twenty thousand: and the Levites that attend the house, they shall have cities to dwell in for a possession.
026	EZE	045	006	And ye shall appoint [for] the possession of the city five thousand in breadth, and in length twenty-five thousand: after the manner of the first-fruits of the holy portion, they shall be for all the house of Israel.
026	EZE	045	007	And the prince [shall have a portion] out of this, and out of this [there shall be a portion] for the first-fruits of the sanctuary, [and] for the possession of the city, in front of the first-fruits of the sanctuary, and in front of the possession of the city westward, and from the western parts eastward: and the length [shall be] equal to one of the parts of the western borders, and the length [shall be] to the eastern borders of the land.
026	EZE	045	008	And he shall have it for a possession in Israel: and the princes of Israel shall no more oppress my people; but the house of Israel shall inherit the land according to their tribes.
026	EZE	045	009	Thus saith the Lord God; Let it suffice you, ye princes of Israel: remove injustice and misery, execute judgment and justice; take away oppression from my people, saith the Lord God.
026	EZE	045	010	Ye shall have a just balance, and a just measure, and a just choenix for measure.
026	EZE	045	011	And in like manner there shall be one choenix as a measure of capacity; the tenth of the gomor [shall be] the choenix, and the tenth of the gomor shall be in fair proportion to the gomor.
026	EZE	045	012	And the weights [shall be] twenty oboli, your pound shall be five shekels, fifteen shekels and fifty shekels.
026	EZE	045	013	And these are the first-fruits which ye shall offer; a sixth part of a gomor of wheat, and the sixth part of it [shall consist] of an ephah of a core of barley.
026	EZE	045	014	And [ye shall give as] the appointed measure of oil one bath of oil out of ten baths; for ten baths are a gomor.
026	EZE	045	015	And one sheep from the flock out of ten, as an oblation from all the tribes of Israel, for sacrifices, and for whole-burnt-offerings, and for peace-offerings, to make atonement for you, saith the Lord God.
026	EZE	045	016	And all the people shall give these first-fruits to the prince of Israel.
026	EZE	045	017	And through the prince shall be [offered] the whole-burnt-offerings and the meat-offerings, and the drink-offerings in the feasts, and at the new moons, and on the sabbaths; and in all the feasts of the house of Israel: he shall offer the sin-offerings, and the meat-offering, and the whole-burnt-offerings, and the peace-offerings, to make atonement for the house of Israel.
026	EZE	045	018	Thus saith the Lord God; In the first month, on the first [day] of the month, ye shall take a calf without blemish out of the herd, to make atonement for the holy place.
026	EZE	045	019	And the priest shall take of the blood of the atonement, and put it on the thresholds of the house, and upon the four corners of the temple, and upon the altar, and upon the thresholds of the gate of the inner court.
026	EZE	045	020	And thus shalt thou do in the seventh month; on the first [day] of the month thou shalt take a rate from each one; and ye shall make atonement for the house.
026	EZE	045	021	And in the first [month], on the fourteenth [day] of the month, ye shall have the feast of the passover; seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread.
026	EZE	045	022	And the prince shall offer in that day a calf for a sin-offering for himself, and the house, and for all the people of the land.
026	EZE	045	023	And for the seven days of the feast he shall offer as whole-burnt-offerings to the Lord seven calves and seven rams without blemish daily for the seven days; and a kid of the goats daily for a sin-offering, and a meat-offering.
026	EZE	045	024	And thou shalt prepare a cake for the calf, and cakes for the ram, and a hin of oil for the cake.
026	EZE	045	025	And in the seventh month, on the fifteenth [day] of the month, thou shalt sacrifice in the feast in the same way seven days, as [they sacrificed] the sin-offerings, and the whole-burnt-offerings, and the freewill-offering, and the oil.
026	EZE	046	001	Thus saith the Lord God; The gate that is in the inner court, that looks eastward, shall be shut the six working days; [but] let it be opened on the sabbath-day, and it shall be opened on the day of the new moon.
026	EZE	046	002	And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of the inner gate, and shall stand at the entrance of the gate, and the priests shall prepare his whole-burnt-offerings and his peace-offerings, and he shall worship at the entrance of the gate: then shall he come forth; but the gate shall not be shut till evening.
026	EZE	046	003	And the people of the land shall worship at the entrance of that gate, both on the sabbaths and at the new moons, before the Lord.
026	EZE	046	004	And the prince shall offer whole-burnt-offerings to the Lord on the sabbath-day, six lambs without blemish, and a ram without blemish;
026	EZE	046	005	and a freewill-offering, a meat-offering for the ram, and a meat-offering for the lambs, the gift of his hand, and a hin of oil for the meat-offering.
026	EZE	046	006	And on the day of the new moon a calf without blemish, and six lambs, and there shall be a ram without blemish;
026	EZE	046	007	and a meat-offering for the ram, and there shall be a meat-offering for the calf as a freewill-offering, and for the lambs, according as his hand can furnish, and [there shall be] a hin of oil for the cake.
026	EZE	046	008	And when the prince goes in, he shall go in by the way of the porch of the gate, and he shall go forth by the way of the gate.
026	EZE	046	009	And whenever the people of the land shall go in before the Lord at the feasts, he that goes in by the way of the north gate to worship shall go forth by the way of the south gate; and he that goes in by the way of the south gate shall go forth by the way of the north gate: he shall not return by the gate by which he entered, but he shall go forth opposite it.
026	EZE	046	010	And the prince shall enter with them in the midst of them when they go in; and when they go forth, he shall go forth.
026	EZE	046	011	And in the feasts and in the general assemblies the freewill oblation shall be a meat-offering for the calf, and a meat-offering for the ram, and for the lambs, as his hand can furnish, and a hin of oil for the meat-offering.
026	EZE	046	012	And if the prince should prepare [as] a thanksgiving a whole-burnt-peace-offering to the Lord, and should open for himself the gate looking eastward, and offer his whole-burnt-offering, and his peace-offerings, as he does on the sabbath-day; then shall he go out, and shall shut the doors after he has gone out.
026	EZE	046	013	And he shall prepare daily as a whole-burnt-offering to the Lord a lamb of a year old without blemish: in the morning shall he prepare it.
026	EZE	046	014	And he shall prepare a freewill-offering for it in the morning, the sixth part of a measure [of flour], and a third part of a hin of oil to mix [therewith] the fine flour, [as] a freewill-offering to the Lord, a perpetual ordinance.
026	EZE	046	015	Ye shall prepare the lamb, and the freewill-offering, and the oil in the morning, [for] a perpetual whole-burnt-sacrifice.
026	EZE	046	016	Thus saith the Lord God; If the prince shall give a gift to one of his sons out of his inheritance, this shall be to his sons a possession [as] an inheritance.
026	EZE	046	017	But if he give a gift to one of his servants, then it shall belong to him until the year of release; and [then] he shall restore [it] to the prince: but of the inheritance of his sons [the possession] shall continue to them.
026	EZE	046	018	And the prince shall by no means take of the inheritance of the people, to oppress them: he shall give an inheritance to his sons out of his [own] possession: that my people be not scattered, every one from his possession.
026	EZE	046	019	And he brought me into the entrance of the [place] behind the gate, into the chamber of the sanctuary belonging to the priests, that looks toward the north: and, behold, there was a place set apart.
026	EZE	046	020	And he said to me, This is the place where the priests shall boil the trespass-offerings and the sin-offerings, and there shall they bake the meat-offering always; so as not to carry [them] out into the outer court, to sanctify the people.
026	EZE	046	021	And he brought me into the outer court, and led me round upon the four sides of the court; and, behold, there was a court on [each of] the sides of the court,
026	EZE	046	022	on [every] side a court, [even] a court for all the four [sides], and [each] little court belonging to the court was in length forty cubits, and [in] breadth thirty cubits, [there was] one measure to the four.
026	EZE	046	023	And [there were] chambers in them round about, round about the four, and cooking-places formed under the chambers round about.
026	EZE	046	024	And he said to me, These are the cooks' houses, where they that serve the house shall boil the sacrifices of the people.
026	EZE	047	001	And he brought me to the entrance of the house; and, behold, water issued from under the porch eastward, for the front of the house looked eastward; and the water came down from the right side, from the south to the altar.
026	EZE	047	002	And he brought me out by the way of the northern gate, and he led me round by the way outside to the gate of the court that looks eastward; and, behold, water came down from the right side,
026	EZE	047	003	in [the direction] in which a man went forth opposite; and [there was] a measuring line in his hand, and he measured a thousand [cubits] with the measure;
026	EZE	047	004	and he passed through the water; [it was] water of a fountain: and [again] he measured a thousand, and passed through the water; and the water was up to the thighs: and [again] he measured a thousand; and he passed through water up to the loins.
026	EZE	047	005	and [again] he measured a thousand; and he could not pass through: for [the water] rose as of a torrent which [men] cannot pass over.
026	EZE	047	006	And he said to me, Hast thou seen [this], son of man? Then he brought me, and led me back to the brink of the river
026	EZE	047	007	as I returned; and, behold, on the brink of the river [there were] very many trees on this side and on that side.
026	EZE	047	008	And he said to me, This is the water that goes forth to Galilee that lies eastward, and it is gone down to Arabia, and has reached as far as to the sea to the outlet of the water: and it shall heal the waters.
026	EZE	047	009	And it shall come to pass, [that] every animal of living [and] moving creatures, all on which the river shall come, shall live: and there shall be there very many fish; for this water shall go thither, and it shall heal [them], and they shall live: everything on which the river shall come shall live.
026	EZE	047	010	And fishers shall stand there from Ingadin to Enagallim; it shall be a place to spread out nets upon; it shall be distinct; and the fishes thereof [shall be] as the fishes of the great sea, a very great multitude.
026	EZE	047	011	But at the outlet of the water, and the turn of it, and where it overflows [its banks], they shall not heal at all; they are given to salt.
026	EZE	047	012	And every fruit tree shall grow by the river, [even] on the bank of it on this side and on that side: they shall not decay upon it, neither shall their fruit fail: they shall bring forth the first-fruit of their early crop, for these their waters come forth of the sanctuary: and their fruit shall be for meat, and their foliage for health.
026	EZE	047	013	Thus saith the Lord God; Ye shall inherit these borders of the land; [they are] given by lot to the twelve tribes of the children of Israel.
026	EZE	047	014	And ye shall inherit it, each according to his brother's portion, [even the land] concerning which I lifted up my hand to give [it] to your fathers: and this land shall fall to you by lot.
026	EZE	047	015	And these are the borders of the land that lies northward, from the great sea that comes down, and divides the entrance of Emaseldam;
026	EZE	047	016	Maabthera, Ebrameliam, between the coasts of Damascus and the coasts of Emathi, the habitation of Saunan, which [places] are above the coasts of Auranitis.
026	EZE	047	017	These are the borders from the sea, from the habitations of Aenan, the coasts of Damascus, and the northern [coasts].
026	EZE	047	018	And the eastern coasts between Loranitis, and Damascus, and the land of Galaad, and the land of Israel, the Jordan divides to the sea that is east of the city of palm-trees. These are the eastern [coasts].
026	EZE	047	019	And the southern and south-western [coasts are] from Thaeman and the city of palm-trees, to the water of Marimoth Cadem, reaching forth to the great sea. This part is the south and south-west.
026	EZE	047	020	This part of the great sea forms a border, till [one comes] opposite the entrance of Emath, [even] as far as the entrance thereof. These are the parts west of Emath.
026	EZE	047	021	So ye shall divide this land to them, [even] to the tribes of Israel.
026	EZE	047	022	Ye shall cast the lot upon it, for yourselves and the strangers that sojourn in the midst of you, who have begotten children in the midst of you: and they shall be to you as natives among the children of Israel; they shall eat with you in [their] inheritance in the midst of the tribes of Israel.
026	EZE	047	023	And they shall be in the tribe of proselytes among the proselytes that are with them: there shall ye give them an inheritance, saith the Lord God.
026	EZE	048	001	And these are the names of the tribes from the northern corner, on the side of the descent that draws a line to the entrance of Emath the palace of Aelam, the border of Damascus northward on the side of Emath the palace; and they shall have the eastern parts as far as the sea, for Dan, one [portion].
026	EZE	048	002	And from the borders of Dan eastward as far as the west sea-coast, for Asser, one.
026	EZE	048	003	And from the borders of Asser, from the eastern parts as far as the west coasts, for Nephthalim, one.
026	EZE	048	004	And from the borders of Nephthalim, from the east as far as the west coasts, for Manasse, one.
026	EZE	048	005	And from the borders of Manasse, from the eastern parts as far as the west coasts, for Ephraim, one.
026	EZE	048	006	And from the borders of Ephraim, from the eastern parts to the west coasts, for Ruben, one.
026	EZE	048	007	And from the borders of Ruben, from the eastern parts as far as the west coasts, for Juda, one.
026	EZE	048	008	And from the borders of Juda, from the eastern parts shall be the offering of first-fruits, in the breadth twenty-five thousand [reeds], and in length as one of the portions [measured] from the east even to the western parts: and the sanctuary shall be in the midst of them.
026	EZE	048	009	[As for] the first-fruits which they shall offer to the Lord, [it shall be] in length twenty-five thousand, and in breadth twenty-five thousand.
026	EZE	048	010	Out of this shall be the first-fruits of the holy things to the priests, northward, five and twenty-thousand, and towards the west, ten thousand, and southward, five and twenty thousand: and the mountain of the sanctuary, shall be in the midst of it,
026	EZE	048	011	for the priests, for the consecrated sons of Sadduc, who keep the charges of the house, who erred not in the error of the children of Israel, as the Levites erred.
026	EZE	048	012	And the first-fruits shall be given to them out of the first-fruits of the land, [even] a most holy portion from the borders of the Levites.
026	EZE	048	013	And the Levites [shall have] the [part], next to the borders of the priests, in length twenty-five thousand, and in breadth ten thousand: the whole length [shall be] five and twenty thousand, and the breadth twenty thousand.
026	EZE	048	014	No [part] of it shall be sold, nor measured [as for sale], neither shall the first-fruits of the land be taken away: for they are holy to the Lord.
026	EZE	048	015	But [concerning] the five thousand that remain in the breadth in the five and twenty thousand, they shall be a suburb to the city for dwelling, and for a space before it: and the city shall be in the midst thereof.
026	EZE	048	016	And these [shall be] its dimensions; from the northern side four thousand and five hundred, and from the southern side four thousand and five hundred, and from the eastern side four thousand and five hundred, and from the western side [they shall measure] four thousand five hundred.
026	EZE	048	017	And there shall be a space to the city northward two hundred and fifty, and southward two hundred and fifty, and eastward two hundred and fifty, and westward two hundred and fifty.
026	EZE	048	018	And the remainder of the length that is next to the first-fruits of the holy [portion shall be] ten thousand eastward, and ten thousand westward: and they shall be the first-fruits of the sanctuary; and the fruits thereof shall be for bread to them that labour for the city.
026	EZE	048	019	And they that labour for the city shall labour for it out of all the tribes of Israel.
026	EZE	048	020	The whole offering [shall be] a square of twenty-five thousand by twenty-five thousand: ye shall separate [again part] of it, the first-fruits of the sanctuary, from the possession of the city.
026	EZE	048	021	And the prince [shall have] the remainder on this side and on that side from the first-fruits of the sanctuary, and [there shall be] a possession of the city, for five and twenty thousand cubits in length, to the eastern and western borders, for five and twenty thousand to the western borders, next to the portions of the prince; and the first-fruits of the holy things and the sanctuary of the house [shall be] in the midst of it.
026	EZE	048	022	And there shall be [a portion taken] from the Levites, from the possession of the city in the midst of the princes between the borders of Juda and the borders of Benjamin, and it shall be [the portion] of the princes.
026	EZE	048	023	And [as for] the rest of the tribes, from the eastern parts as far as the western, Benjamin [shall have] one [portion].
026	EZE	048	024	And from the borders of Benjamin, from the eastern parts to the western, Symeon, one.
026	EZE	048	025	And from the borders of Symeon, from the eastern parts to the western, Issachar, one.
026	EZE	048	026	And from the borders of Issachar, from the eastern parts to the western, Zabulon, one.
026	EZE	048	027	And from the borders of Zabulon, from the east to the western parts, Gad, one.
026	EZE	048	028	And from the borders of Gad, from the eastern parts to the south-western parts; his coasts shall even be from Thaeman, and the water of Barimoth Cades, for an inheritance, unto the great sea.
026	EZE	048	029	This is the land, which ye shall divide by lot to the tribes of Israel, and these are their portions, saith the Lord God.
026	EZE	048	030	And these are the goings out of the city northward, four thousand and five hundred by measure.
026	EZE	048	031	And the gates of the city [shall be] after the names of the tribes of Israel: three gates northward; the gate of Ruben, one, and the gate of Juda, one, and the gate of Levi, one.

# BOOK	027	DAN	Daniel	Daniel
027	DAN	001	001	In the third year of the reign of Joakim king of Juda, came Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon to Jerusalem, and besieged it.
027	DAN	001	002	And the Lord gave into his hand Joakim king of Juda, and part of the vessels of the house of God: and he brought them into the land of Sennaar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure-house of his god.
027	DAN	001	003	And the king told Asphanez his chief eunuch, to bring in [some] of the captive children of Israel, and of the seed of the kingdom, and of the princes;
027	DAN	001	004	young men in whom was no blemish, and beautiful in appearance, and skilled in all wisdom, and possessing knowledge, and acquainted with prudence, and who had ability to stand in the house before the king, and [the king gave commandment] to teach them the learning and language of the Chaldeans.
027	DAN	001	005	And the king appointed them a daily portion from the king’s table, and from the wine which he drank; and [gave orders] to nourish them three years, and [that] afterwards they should stand before the king.
027	DAN	001	006	Now these were among them of the children of Juda, Daniel, and Ananias, and Azarias, and Misael.
027	DAN	001	007	And the chief of the eunuchs gave them names: to Daniel, Baltasar; and to Ananias, Sedrach; and to Misael, Misach; and to Azarias, Abdenago.
027	DAN	001	008	And Daniel purposed in his heart, that he would not defile himself with the king’s table, nor with the wine of his drink: and he intreated the chief of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.
027	DAN	001	009	Now God [had] brought Daniel into favour and compassion with the chief of the eunuchs.
027	DAN	001	010	And the chief of the eunuchs said to Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who has appointed your meat and your drink, lest he see your countenances gloomy in comparison of the young men your equals; so shall ye endanger my head to the king.
027	DAN	001	011	And Daniel said to Amelsad, whom the chief of the eunuchs had appointed over Daniel, Ananias, Misael, [and] Azarias,
027	DAN	001	012	Prove now thy servants ten days; and let them give us pulse, and let us eat, and let us drink water:
027	DAN	001	013	and let our countenances be seen by thee, and the countenances of the children that eat [at] the king’s table; and deal with thy servants according as thou shalt see.
027	DAN	001	014	And he hearkened to them, and proved them ten days.
027	DAN	001	015	And at the end of the ten days their countenances appeared fairer and stouter in flesh than the children that fed at the king’s table.
027	DAN	001	016	So Amelsad took away their supper and the wine of their drink, and gave them pulse.
027	DAN	001	017	And [as for] these four children, God gave them understanding and prudence in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.
027	DAN	001	018	And at the end of the days, [after] which the king had given orders to bring them in, then the chief of the eunuchs brought them in before Nabuchodonosor.
027	DAN	001	019	And the king spoke with them; and there were not found out of them all any like Daniel, and Ananias, and Misael, and Azarias: and they stood before the king.
027	DAN	001	020	And in every matter of wisdom and knowledge wherein the king questioned them, he found them ten times wiser than all the enchanters and sorcerers that were in all his kingdom.
027	DAN	001	021	And Daniel continued till the first year of king Cyrus.
027	DAN	002	001	In the second year of [his] reign Nabuchodonosor dreamed a dream, and his spirit was amazed, and his sleep departed from him.
027	DAN	002	002	And the king gave orders to call the enchanters, and the magicians, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, to declare to the king his dreams. And they came and stood before the king.
027	DAN	002	003	And the king said to them, I have dreamed, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream.
027	DAN	002	004	And the Chaldeans spoke to the king in the Syrian language, [saying], O king, live for ever: do thou tell the dream to thy servants, and we will declare the interpretation.
027	DAN	002	005	The king answered the Chaldeans, The thing has departed from me: if ye do not make known to me the dream and the interpretation, ye shall be destroyed, and your houses shall be spoiled.
027	DAN	002	006	But if ye make known to me the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and presents and much honour: only tell me the dream, and the interpretation thereof.
027	DAN	002	007	They answered the second time, and said, Let the king tell the dream to his servants, and we will declare the interpretation.
027	DAN	002	008	And the king answered and said, I verily know that ye are trying to gain time, because ye see that the thing has gone from me.
027	DAN	002	009	If then ye do not tell me the dream, I know that ye have concerted to utter before me a false and corrupt tale, until the time shall have past: tell me my dream, and I shall know that ye will also declare to me the interpretation thereof.
027	DAN	002	010	The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is no man upon the earth, who shall be able to make known the king’s matter: forasmuch as no great king or ruler asks such a question of an enchanter, magician, or Chaldean.
027	DAN	002	011	For the question which the king asks is difficult, and there is no one else who shall answer it before the king, but the gods, whose dwelling is not with any flesh.
027	DAN	002	012	Then the king in rage and anger commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.
027	DAN	002	013	So the decree went forth, and they began to slay the wise men; and they sought Daniel and his fellows to slay [them].
027	DAN	002	014	Then Daniel answered [with] counsel and prudence to Arioch the captain of the royal guard, who was gone forth to kill the wise men of Babylon; [saying],
027	DAN	002	015	Chief magistrate of the king, wherefore has the peremptory command proceeded from the king? So Arioch made known the matter to Daniel.
027	DAN	002	016	And Daniel intreated the king to give him time, and that he might [thus] declare to the king the interpretation of it.
027	DAN	002	017	So Daniel went into his house, and made known the matter to Ananias, and Misael, and Azarias, his friends.
027	DAN	002	018	And they sought mercies from the God of heaven concerning this mystery; that Daniel and his friends might not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.
027	DAN	002	019	Then the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision of the night: and Daniel blessed the God of heaven, and said,
027	DAN	002	020	May the name of God be blessed from everlasting and to everlasting: for wisdom and understanding are his.
027	DAN	002	021	And he changes times and seasons: he appoints kings, and removes [them], giving wisdom to the wise, and prudence to them that have understanding:
027	DAN	002	022	he reveals deep and secret [matters]; knowing what is in darkness, and the light is with him.
027	DAN	002	023	I give thanks to thee, and praise [thee], O God of my fathers, for thou hast given me wisdom and power, and hast made known to me the things which we asked of thee; and thou hast made known to me the king’s vision.
027	DAN	002	024	And Daniel came to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon, and said to him; Destroy not the wise men of Babylon, but bring me in before the king, and I will declare the interpretation to the king.
027	DAN	002	025	Then Arioch in haste brought in Daniel before the king, and said to him, I have found a man of the children of the captivity of Judea, who will declare the interpretation to the king.
027	DAN	002	026	And the king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Baltasar, Canst thou declare to me the dream which I saw, and the interpretation thereof?
027	DAN	002	027	And Daniel answered before the king, and said, The mystery which the king asks [the explanation of] is not [in the power] of the wise men, magicians, enchanters, [or] soothsayers to declare to the king.
027	DAN	002	028	But there is a God in heaven revealing mysteries, and he has made known to king Nabuchodonosor what things must come to pass in the last days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are as follows,
027	DAN	002	029	O king: thy thoughts upon thy bed arose [as to] what must come to pass hereafter: and he that reveals mysteries has made known to thee what must come to pass.
027	DAN	002	030	Moreover, this mystery has not been revealed to me by reason of wisdom which is in me beyond all [others] living, but for the sake of making known the interpretation to the king, that thou mightest know the thoughts of thine heart.
027	DAN	002	031	Thou, O king, sawest, and behold an image: that image was great, and the appearance of it excellent, standing before thy face; and the form of it was terrible.
027	DAN	002	032	[It was] an image, the head of which was of fine gold, its hands and breast and arms of silver, [its] belly and thighs of brass,
027	DAN	002	033	its legs of iron, its feet, part of iron and part of earthenware.
027	DAN	002	034	Thou sawest until a stone was cut out of a mountain without hands, and it smote the image upon its feet of iron and earthenware, and utterly reduced them to powder.
027	DAN	002	035	Then once for all the earthenware, the iron, the brass, the silver, the gold, were ground to powder, and became as chaff from the summer threshingfloor; and the violence of the wind carried them away, and no place was found for them: and the stone which had smitten the image became a great mountain, and filled all the earth.
027	DAN	002	036	This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king.
027	DAN	002	037	Thou, O king, art a king of kings, to whom the God of heaven has given a powerful and strong and honourable kingdom,
027	DAN	002	038	in every place where the children of men dwell: and he has given into thine hand the wild beasts of the field, and the birds of the sky and the fish of the sea, and he has made thee lord of all.
027	DAN	002	039	Thou art the head of gold. And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and a third kingdom which is the brass, which shall have dominion over all the earth;
027	DAN	002	040	and a fourth kingdom, which shall be strong as iron: as iron beats to powder and subdues all things, so shall it beat to powder and subdue.
027	DAN	002	041	And whereas thou sawest the feet and the toes, part of earthenware and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; yet there shall be in it of the strength of iron, as thou sawest the iron mixed with earthenware.
027	DAN	002	042	And [whereas] the toes of the feet were part of iron and part of earthenware, part of the kingdom shall be strong, and [part] of it shall be broken.
027	DAN	002	043	Whereas thou sawest the iron mixed with earthenware, they shall be mingled with the seed of men: but they shall not cleave together, as the iron does not mix itself with earthenware.
027	DAN	002	044	And in the days of those kings the God of heaven shall set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed: and his kingdom shall not be left to another people, [but] it shall beat to pieces and grind to powder all [other] kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.
027	DAN	002	045	Whereas thou sawest that a stone was cut out of a mountain without hands, and it beat to pieces the earthenware, the iron, the brass, the silver, the gold; the great God has made known to the king what must happen hereafter: and the dream is true, and the interpretation thereof sure.
027	DAN	002	046	Then king Nabuchodonosor fell upon his face, and worshipped Daniel, and gave orders to offer to him gifts and incense.
027	DAN	002	047	And the king answered and said to Daniel, Of a truth your God is a God of gods, and Lord of kings, who reveals mysteries; for thou hast been able to reveal this mystery.
027	DAN	002	048	And the king promoted Daniel, and gave him great and abundant gifts, and set him over the whole province of Babylon, and [made him] chief satrap over all the wise men of Babylon.
027	DAN	002	049	And Daniel asked of the king, and he appointed Sedrach, Misach, and Abdenago, over the affairs of the province of Babylon: but Daniel was in the king’s palace.
027	DAN	003	001	In [his] eighteenth year Nabuchodonosor the king made a golden image, its height was sixty cubits, its breadth six cubits: and he set it up in the plain of Deira, in the province of Babylon.
027	DAN	003	002	And he sent forth to gather the governors, and the captains, and the heads of provinces, chiefs, and princes, and those who were in authority, and all the rulers of districts, to come to the dedication of the image.
027	DAN	003	003	So the heads of provinces, the governors, the captains, the chiefs, the great princes, those who were in authority, and all the rulers of districts, were gathered to the dedication of the image which king Nabuchodonosor had set up; and they stood before the image.
027	DAN	003	004	Then a herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, ye peoples, tribes, [and] languages,
027	DAN	003	005	at what hour ye shall hear the sound of the trumpet, and pipe, and harp, and sackbut, and psaltery, and every kind of music, ye shall fall down and worship the golden image which king Nabuchodonosor has set up.
027	DAN	003	006	And whosoever shall not fall down and worship, in the same hour he shall be cast into the burning fiery furnace.
027	DAN	003	007	And it came to pass when the nations heard the sound of the trumpet, and pipe, and harp, and sackbut, and psaltery, and all kinds of music, all the nations, tribes, [and] languages, fell down and worshipped the golden image which king Nabuchodonosor had set up.
027	DAN	003	008	Then came near [certain] Chaldeans, and accused the Jews to the king, [saying],
027	DAN	003	009	O king, live for ever.
027	DAN	003	010	Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man who shall hear the sound of the trumpet, and pipe, and harp, sackbut, and psaltery, and all kinds of music,
027	DAN	003	011	and shall not fall down and worship the golden image, shall be cast into the burning fiery furnace.
027	DAN	003	012	There are [certain] Jews whom thou hast appointed over the affairs of the province of Babylon, Sedrach, Misach, [and] Abdenago, who have not obeyed thy decree, O king: they serve not thy gods, and worship not the golden image which thou hast set up.
027	DAN	003	013	Then Nabuchodonosor in wrath and anger commanded to bring Sedrach, Misach, and Abdenago: and they were brought before the king.
027	DAN	003	014	And Nabuchodonosor answered and said to them, Is it true, Sedrach, Misach, [and] Abdenago, that ye serve not my gods, and worship not the golden image which I have set up?
027	DAN	003	015	Now then if ye be ready, whensoever ye shall hear the sound of the trumpet, and pipe, and harp, and sackbut, and psaltery, and harmony, and every kind of music, to fall down and worship the golden image which I have made; [well]: but if ye worship not, in the same hour ye shall be cast into the burning fiery furnace; and who is the God that shall deliver you out of my hand?
027	DAN	003	016	Then answered Sedrach, Misach, [and] Abdenago, and said to king Nabuchodonosor, We have no need to answer thee concerning this matter.
027	DAN	003	017	For our God whom we serve is in the heavens, able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will rescue us from thy hands, O king.
027	DAN	003	018	But if not, be it known to thee, O king, that we [will] not serve thy gods, nor worship the image which thou hast set up.
027	DAN	003	019	Then Nabuchodonosor was filled with wrath, and the form of his countenance was changed toward Sedrach, Misach, and Abdenago: and he gave orders to heat the furnace seven times [more than usual], until it should burn to the uttermost.
027	DAN	003	020	And he commanded mighty men to bind Sedrach, Misach, and Abdenago, and to cast [them] into the burning fiery furnace.
027	DAN	003	021	Then those men were bound with their coats, and caps, and hose, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace,
027	DAN	003	022	forasmuch as the king’s word prevailed; and the furnace was made exceeding hot.
027	DAN	003	023	Then these three men, Sedrach, Misach, and Abdenago, fell bound into the midst of the burning furnace, and walked in the midst of the flame, singing praise to God, and blessing the Lord.
027	DAN	003	024	And Nabuchodonosor heard them singing praises; and he wondered, and rose up in haste, and said to his nobles, Did we not cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? and they said to the king, Yes, O king.
027	DAN	003	025	And the king said, But I see four men loose, and walking in the midst of the fire, and there has no harm happened to them; and the appearance of the fourth is like the Son of God.
027	DAN	003	026	Then Nabuchodonosor drew near to the door of the burning fiery furnace, and said, Sedrach, Misach, [and] Abdenago, ye servants of the most high God, proceed forth, and come hither. So Sedrach, Misach, [and] Abdenago, came forth out of the midst of the fire.
027	DAN	003	027	Then were assembled the satraps, and captains, and heads of provinces, and the royal princes; and they saw the men, [and perceived] that the fire had not had power against their bodies, and the hair of their head was not burnt, and their coats were not scorched, nor was the smell of fire upon them.
027	DAN	003	028	And king Nabuchodonosor answered and said, Blessed be the God of Sedrach, Misach, [and] Abdenago, who has sent his angel, and delivered his servants, because they trusted in him; and they have changed the king’s word, and delivered their bodies to be burnt, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.
027	DAN	003	029	Wherefore I publish a decree: Every people, tribe, [or] language, that shall speak reproachfully against the God of Sedrach, Misach, [and] Abdenago, shall be destroyed, and their houses shall be plundered: because there is no other God who shall be able to deliver thus.
027	DAN	003	030	Then the king promoted Sedrach, Misach, [and] Abdenago, in the province of Babylon, and advanced them, and gave them authority to rule over all the Jews who were in his kingdom.
027	DAN	004	001	King Nabuchodonosor to all nations, tribes, and tongues, who dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied to you.
027	DAN	004	002	It seemed good to me to declare to you the signs and wonders which the most high God has wrought with me,
027	DAN	004	003	how great and mighty [they are]: his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his power to all generations.
027	DAN	004	004	I Nabuchodonosor was thriving in my house, and prospering.
027	DAN	004	005	I saw a vision, and it terrified me, and I was troubled on my bed, and the visions of my head troubled me.
027	DAN	004	006	And I made a decree to bring in before me all the wise men of Babylon, that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream.
027	DAN	004	007	So the enchanters, magicians, soothsayers, [and] Chaldeans came in: and I told the dream before them; but they did not make known to me the interpretation thereof;
027	DAN	004	008	until Daniel came, whose name is Baltasar, according to the name of my God, who has within him the Holy Spirit of God; to whom I said,
027	DAN	004	009	O Baltasar, chief of the enchanters, of whom I know that the Holy Spirit of God is in thee, and no mystery is too hard for thee, hear the vision of my dream which I had, and tell me the interpretation of it.
027	DAN	004	010	I had a vision upon my bed; and behold a tree in the midst of the earth, and its height was great.
027	DAN	004	011	The tree grew large and strong, and its height reached to the sky, and its extent to the extremity of the whole earth:
027	DAN	004	012	its leaves were fair, and its fruit abundant, and in it was meat for all; and under it the wild beasts of the field took shelter, and the birds of the sky lodged in the branches of it, and all flesh was fed of it.
027	DAN	004	013	I beheld in the night vision upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher and an holy one came down from heaven, and cried aloud, and thus he said,
027	DAN	004	014	Cut down the tree, and pluck off its branches, and shake off its leaves, and scatter its fruit: let the wild beasts be removed from under it, and the birds from its branches.
027	DAN	004	015	Only leave the stump of its roots in the earth, and [bind it] with an iron and brass band; and it shall lie in the grass that is without and in the dew of heaven, and its portion [shall be] with the wild beasts in the grass of the field.
027	DAN	004	016	His heart shall be changed from that of man, and the heart of a wild beast shall be given to him; and seven times shall pass over him.
027	DAN	004	017	The matter is by the decree of the watcher, and the demand is a word of the holy ones; that the living may know that the Lord is most high [over] the kingdom of men, and he will give it to whomsoever he shall please, and will set up over it that which is set at nought of men.
027	DAN	004	018	This is the vision which I king Nabuchodonosor saw: and do thou, Baltasar, declare the interpretation, for none of the wise men of my kingdom are able to shew me the interpretation of it: but thou, Daniel, art able; for the Holy Spirit of God is in thee.
027	DAN	004	019	Then Daniel, whose name is Baltasar, was amazed about one hour, and his thoughts troubled him. And Baltasar answered and said, [My] lord, let the dream be to them that hate thee, and the interpretation of it to thine enemies.
027	DAN	004	020	The tree which thou sawest, that grew large and strong, whose height reached to the sky and its extent to all the earth;
027	DAN	004	021	and whose leaves were flourishing, and its fruit abundant, (and it was meat for all; under it the wild beasts lodged, and the birds of the sky took shelter in its branches:)
027	DAN	004	022	is thyself, O king; for thou art grown great and powerful, and thy greatness has increased and reached to heaven, and thy dominion to the ends of the earth.
027	DAN	004	023	And whereas the king saw a watcher and a holy one coming down from heaven, and he said, Strip the tree, and destroy it; only leave the stump of its roots in the ground, and [bind it] with a band of iron and brass; and it shall lie in the grass that is without, and in the dew of heaven, and its portion shall be with wild beasts, until seven times have passed over it;
027	DAN	004	024	this is the interpretation of it, O king, and it is a decree of the Most High, which has come upon my lord the king.
027	DAN	004	025	And they shall drive thee forth from men, and thy dwelling shall be with wild beasts, and they shall feed thee with grass as an ox, and thou shalt have thy lodging under the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over thee, until thou know that the Most High is Lord of the kingdom of men, and will give it to whom he shall please.
027	DAN	004	026	And whereas they said, Leave the stumps of the roots of the tree; thy kingdom abides [sure] to thee from the time that thou shalt know the power of the heavens.
027	DAN	004	027	Therefore, O king, let my counsel please thee, and atone for thy sins by alms, and [thine] iniquities by compassion on the poor: it may be God will be long-suffering to thy trespasses.
027	DAN	004	028	All these things came upon king Nabuchodonosor.
027	DAN	004	029	After a twelvemonth, as he walked in his palace in Babylon,
027	DAN	004	030	the king answered and said, Is not this great Babylon, which I have built for a royal residence, by the might of my power, for the honour of my glory?
027	DAN	004	031	While the word was yet in the king’s mouth, there came a voice from heaven, [saying], To thee, king Nabuchodonosor, they say, The kingdom has departed from thee.
027	DAN	004	032	And they [shall] drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the wild beasts of the field, and they shall feed thee with grass as an ox: and seven times shall pass over thee, until thou know that the Most High is Lord of the kingdom of men, and he will give it to whomsoever he shall please.
027	DAN	004	033	In the same hour the word was fulfilled upon Nabuchodonosor: and he was driven forth from men, and he ate grass as an ox, and his body was bathed with the dew of heaven, until his hairs were grown like lions’ [hairs], and his nails as birds’ [claws].
027	DAN	004	034	And at the end of the time I Nabuchodonosor lifted up mine eyes to heaven, and my reason returned to me, and I blessed the Most High, and praised him that lives for ever, and gave [him] glory; for his dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom [lasts] to all generations:
027	DAN	004	035	and all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing: and he does according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth: and there is none who shall withstand his power, and say to him, What hast thou done?
027	DAN	004	036	At the same time my reason returned to me, and I came to the honour of my kingdom; and my [natural] form returned to me, and my princes, and my nobles, sought me, and I was established in my kingdom, and more abundant majesty was added to me.
027	DAN	004	037	Now therefore I Nabuchodonosor praise and greatly exalt and glorify the King of heaven; for all his works are true, and his paths are judgment: and all that walk in pride he is able to abase.
027	DAN	005	001	Baltasar the king made a great supper for his thousand nobles, and [there was] wine before the thousand.
027	DAN	005	002	And Baltasar drinking gave orders as he tasted the wine that they should bring the gold and silver vessels, which Nabuchodonosor his father had brought forth from the temple in Jerusalem; that the king, and his nobles, and his mistresses, and his concubines, should drink out of them.
027	DAN	005	003	So the gold and silver vessels were brought which [Nabuchodonosor] had taken out of the temple of God in Jerusalem; and the king, and his nobles, and his mistresses, and his concubines, drank out of them.
027	DAN	005	004	They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, and of brass, and of iron, and of wood, and of stone.
027	DAN	005	005	In the same hour came forth fingers of a man’s hand, and wrote in front of the lamp on the plaster of the wall of the king’s house: and the king saw the knuckles of the hand that wrote.
027	DAN	005	006	Then the king’s countenance changed, and his thoughts troubled him, and the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one another.
027	DAN	005	007	And the king cried aloud to bring in the magicians, Chaldeans, [and] soothsayers; and he said to the wise men of Babylon, Whosoever shall read this writing, and make known to me the interpretation, shall be clothed with scarlet, and [there shall be] a golden chain upon his neck, and he shall be the third ruler in my kingdom.
027	DAN	005	008	Then came in all the king’s wise men: but they could not read the writing, nor make known the interpretation to the king.
027	DAN	005	009	And king Baltasar was troubled, and his countenance changed upon him, and his nobles were troubled with him.
027	DAN	005	010	Then the queen came into the banquet house, and said, O king, live for ever: let not thy thoughts trouble thee, and let not thy countenance be changed.
027	DAN	005	011	There is a man in thy kingdom, in whom is the Spirit of God; and in the days of thy father watchfulness and understanding were found in him; and king Nabuchodonosor thy father made him chief of the enchanters, magicians, Chaldeans, [and] soothsayers.
027	DAN	005	012	For [there is] an excellent spirit in him, and sense and understanding are in him, interpreting dreams [as he does], and answering hard [questions], and solving difficulties: [it is] Daniel, and the king gave him the name of Baltasar: now then let him be called, and he shall tell thee the interpretation of the writing.
027	DAN	005	013	Then Daniel was brought in before the king: and the king said to Daniel, Art thou Daniel, of the children of the captivity of Judea, which the king my father brought?
027	DAN	005	014	I have heard concerning thee, that the Spirit of God is in thee, and [that] watchfulness and understanding and excellent wisdom have been found in thee.
027	DAN	005	015	And now the wise men, magicians, [and] soothsayers have come in before me, to read the writing, and make known to me the interpretation: but they could not tell it me.
027	DAN	005	016	And I have heard concerning thee, that thou art able to make interpretations: now then if thou shalt be able to read the writing, and to make known to me the interpretation of it, thou shalt be clothed with purple, and there shall be a golden chain upon thy neck, and thou shalt be third ruler in my kingdom.
027	DAN	005	017	And Daniel said before the king, Let thy gifts be to thyself, and give the present of thine house to another; but I will read the writing, and will make known to thee the interpretation of it.
027	DAN	005	018	O king, the most high God gave to thy father Nabuchodonosor a kingdom, and majesty, and honour, and glory:
027	DAN	005	019	and by reason of the majesty which he gave to him, all nations, tribes [and] languages trembled and feared before him: whom he would he slew; and whom he would he smote; and whom he would he exalted; and whom he would he abased.
027	DAN	005	020	But when his heart was lifted up, and his spirit was emboldened to act proudly, he was deposed from his royal throne, and [his] honour was taken from him.
027	DAN	005	021	And he was driven forth from men; and his heart was given him after the nature of wild beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild asses; and they fed him with grass as an ox, and his body was bathed with the dew of heaven; until he knew that the most high God is Lord of the kingdom of men, and will give it to whomsoever he shall please.
027	DAN	005	022	And thou accordingly, his son, O Baltasar, hast not humbled thine heart before God: knowest thou not all this?
027	DAN	005	023	And thou hast been exalted against the Lord God of heaven; and they have brought before thee the vessels of his house, and thou, and thy nobles, and thy mistresses, and thy concubines, have drunk wine out of them; and thou hast praised the gods of gold, and silver, and brass, and iron, and wood, and stone, which see not, and which hear not, and know not: and the God in whose hand are thy breath and all thy ways hast thou not glorified.
027	DAN	005	024	Therefore from his presence has been sent forth the knuckle of a hand; and he has ordered this writing.
027	DAN	005	025	And this is the ordered writing, Mane, Thekel, Phares.
027	DAN	005	026	This is the interpretation of the sentence: Mane; God has measured thy kingdom, and finished it.
027	DAN	005	027	Thekel; it has been weighed in the balance, and found wanting.
027	DAN	005	028	Phares; thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.
027	DAN	005	029	Then Baltasar commanded, and they clothed Daniel with scarlet, and put the golden chain about his neck, and proclaimed concerning him that he was the third ruler in the kingdom.
027	DAN	005	030	In the same night was Baltasar the Chaldean king slain.
027	DAN	005	031	And Darius the Mede succeeded to the kingdom, being sixty-two years [old].
027	DAN	006	001	And it pleased Darius, and he set over the kingdom a hundred and twenty satraps, to be in all his kingdom;
027	DAN	006	002	and over them three governors, of whom one was Daniel; for the satraps to give account to them, that the king should not be troubled.
027	DAN	006	003	And Daniel was over them, for [there was] an excellent spirit in him; and the king set him over all his kingdom.
027	DAN	006	004	Then the governors and satraps sought to find occasion against Daniel; but they found against him no occasion, nor trespass, nor error, because he was faithful.
027	DAN	006	005	And the governors said, We shall not find occasion against Daniel, except in the ordinances of his God.
027	DAN	006	006	Then the governors and satraps stood by the king, and said to him, King Darius, live for ever.
027	DAN	006	007	All who preside over thy kingdom, captains and satraps, chiefs and local governors, have taken counsel together, to establish by a royal statute and to confirm a decree, that whosoever shall ask a petition of any god or man for thirty days, save of thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions.
027	DAN	006	008	Now then, O king, establish the decree, and publish a writ, that the decree of the Persians and Medes be not changed.
027	DAN	006	009	Then king Darius commanded the decree to be written.
027	DAN	006	010	And when Daniel knew that the decree was ordered, he went into his house; and his windows were opened in his chambers toward Jerusalem, and three times in the day he knelt upon his knees, and prayed and gave thanks before his God, as he used to do before.
027	DAN	006	011	Then these men watched, and found Daniel praying and supplicating to his God.
027	DAN	006	012	And they came and said to the king, O king, hast thou not made a decree, that whatsoever man shall ask a petition of any god or man for thirty days, but of thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions? And the king said, The word is true, and the decree of the Medes and Persians shall not pass.
027	DAN	006	013	Then they answered and said before the king, Daniel of the children of the captivity of Judea, has not submitted to thy decree; and three times in the day he makes his requests of his God.
027	DAN	006	014	Then the king, when he heard the saying, was much grieved for Daniel, and he greatly exerted himself for Daniel to deliver him: and he exerted himself till evening to deliver him.
027	DAN	006	015	Then those men said to the king, Know, O king, that the law of the Medes and Persians is, that we must not change any decree or statute which the king shall make.
027	DAN	006	016	Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions. But the king said to Daniel, Thy God whom thou servest continually, he will deliver thee.
027	DAN	006	017	And they brought a stone, and put it on the mouth of the den; and the king sealed [it] with his ring, and with the ring of his nobles; that the case might not be altered with regard to Daniel.
027	DAN	006	018	And the king departed to his house, and lay down fasting, and they brought him no food; and his sleep departed from him. But God shut the mouths of the lions, and they did not molest Daniel.
027	DAN	006	019	Then the king arose very early in the morning, and came in haste to the den of lions.
027	DAN	006	020	And when he drew near to the den, he cried with a loud voice, Daniel, servant of the living God, has thy God, whom thou servest continually, been able to deliver thee from the lion’s mouth?
027	DAN	006	021	And Daniel said to the king, O king, live for ever.
027	DAN	006	022	My God has sent his angel, and stopped the lions’ mouths, and they have not hurt me: for uprightness was found in me before him; and moreover before thee, O king, I have committed no trespass.
027	DAN	006	023	Then the king was very glad for him, and he commanded to bring Daniel out of the den. So Daniel was brought out of the den, and there was found no hurt upon him, because he believed in his God.
027	DAN	006	024	And the king commanded, and they brought the men that had accused Daniel, and they were cast into the den of lions, they, and their children, and their wives: and they reached not the bottom of the den before the lions had the mastery of them, and utterly broke to pieces all their bones.
027	DAN	006	025	Then king Darius wrote to all nations, tribes, [and] languages, who dwell in all the earth, [saying], Peace be multiplied to you.
027	DAN	006	026	This decree has been set forth by me in every dominion of my kingdom, that [men] tremble and fear before the God of Daniel: for he is the living and eternal God, and his kingdom shall not be destroyed, and his dominion is for ever.
027	DAN	006	027	He helps and delivers, and works signs and wonders in the heaven and on the earth, who has rescued Daniel from the power of the lions.
027	DAN	006	028	And Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.
027	DAN	007	001	In the first year of Baltasar king of the Chaldeans Daniel had a dream, and visions of his head upon his bed: and he wrote his dream.
027	DAN	007	002	I Daniel beheld, and, lo, the four winds of heaven blew violently upon the great sea.
027	DAN	007	003	And there came up four great beasts out of the sea, differing from one another.
027	DAN	007	004	The first [was] as a lioness, and her wings as an eagle’s: I beheld until her wings were plucked, and she was lifted off from the earth, and she stood on human feet, and a man’s heart was given to her.
027	DAN	007	005	And, behold, a second beast like a bear, and it supported itself on one side, and there were three ribs in its mouth, between its teeth: and thus they said to it, Arise, devour much flesh.
027	DAN	007	006	After this one I looked, and behold another wild beast as a leopard, and it had four wings of a bird upon it: and the wild beast had four heads, and power was given to it.
027	DAN	007	007	After this one I looked, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and exceedingly strong, and its teeth were of iron; devouring and crushing to atoms, and it trampled the remainder with its feet: and it was altogether different from all the beasts that were before it; and it [had] ten horns.
027	DAN	007	008	I noticed his horns, and, behold, another little horn came up in the midst of them, and before it three of the former horns were rooted out: and, behold, [there were] eyes as the eyes of a man in this horn, and a mouth speaking great things.
027	DAN	007	009	I beheld until the thrones were set, and the Ancient of days sat; and his raiment was white as snow, and the hair of his head as pure wool: his throne was a flame of fire, [and] his wheels burning fire.
027	DAN	007	010	A stream of fire rushed forth before him: thousand thousands ministered to him, and ten thousands of myriads attended upon him: the judgment sat, and the books were opened.
027	DAN	007	011	I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which that horn spoke, until the wild beast was slain and destroyed, and his body given to be burnt with fire.
027	DAN	007	012	And the dominion of the rest of the wild beasts was taken away; but a prolonging of life was given them for certain times.
027	DAN	007	013	I beheld in the night vision, and, lo, [one] coming with the clouds of heaven as the Son of man, and he came on to the Ancient of days, and was brought near to him.
027	DAN	007	014	And to him was given the dominion, and the honour, and the kingdom; and all nations, tribes, and languages, shall serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom shall not be destroyed.
027	DAN	007	015	[As for] me Daniel, my spirit in my body trembled, and the visions of my head troubled me.
027	DAN	007	016	And I drew near to one of them that stood by, and I sought to learn of him the truth of all these things: and he told me the truth, and made known to me the interpretation of the things.
027	DAN	007	017	These four beasts are four kingdoms [that] shall rise up on the earth:
027	DAN	007	018	which shall be taken away; and the saints of the Most High shall take the kingdom, and possess it for ever and ever.
027	DAN	007	019	Then I enquired carefully concerning the fourth beast; for it differed from every [other] beast, exceeding dreadful: its teeth were of iron, and its claws of brass, devouring, and utterly breaking to pieces, and it trampled the remainder with its feet:
027	DAN	007	020	and concerning its ten horns that were in its head, and the other that came up, and rooted up [some] of the former, which had eyes, and a mouth speaking great things, and his look was bolder than the rest.
027	DAN	007	021	I beheld, and that horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them;
027	DAN	007	022	until the Ancient of days came, and he gave judgment to the saints of the Most High; and the time came on, and the saints possessed the kingdom.
027	DAN	007	023	And he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom on the earth, which shall excel all [other] kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and trample and destroy it.
027	DAN	007	024	And his ten horns are ten kings [that] shall arise: and after them shall arise another, who shall exceed all the former ones in wickedness, and he shall subdue three kings.
027	DAN	007	025	And he shall speak words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High, and shall think to change times and law: and [power] shall be given into his hand for a time and times and half a time.
027	DAN	007	026	And the judgment has sat, and they shall remove [his] dominion to abolish it, and to destroy it utterly.
027	DAN	007	027	And the kingdom and the power and the greatness of the kings that are under the whole heaven were given to the saints of the Most High; and his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all powers shall serve and obey him.
027	DAN	007	028	Hitherto is the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my thoughts greatly troubled me, and my countenance was changed: but I kept the matter in my heart.
027	DAN	008	001	In the third year of the reign of king Baltasar a vision appeared to me, [even] to me Daniel, after that which appeared to me at the first.
027	DAN	008	002	And I was in Susa the palace, which is in the land of Ælam, and I was on the [bank of] Ubal.
027	DAN	008	003	And I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, a ram standing in front of the Ubal; and he had high horns; and one was higher than the other, and the high one came up last.
027	DAN	008	004	And I saw the ram butting westward, and northward, and southward; and no beast could stand before him, and there was none that could deliver out of his hand; and he did according to his will, and became great.
027	DAN	008	005	And I was considering, and, behold, a he-goat came from the south-west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the earth: and the goat [had] a horn between his eyes.
027	DAN	008	006	And he came to the ram that had the horns, which I had seen standing in front of the Ubal, and he ran at him with the violence of his strength.
027	DAN	008	007	And I saw him coming up close to the ram, and he was furiously enraged against him, and he smote the ram, and broke both his horns: and there was no strength in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him on the ground, and trampled on him; and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.
027	DAN	008	008	And the he-goat grew exceedingly great: and when he was strong, his great horn was broken; and four other [horns] rose up in its place toward the four winds of heaven.
027	DAN	008	009	And out of one of them came forth one strong horn, and it grew very great toward the south, and toward the host:
027	DAN	008	010	and it magnified itself to the host of heaven; and there fell to the earth [some] of the host of heaven and of the stars, and they trampled on them.
027	DAN	008	011	And [this shall be] until the chief captain shall have delivered the captivity: and by reason of him the sacrifice was disturbed, and he prospered; and the holy place shall be made desolate.
027	DAN	008	012	And a sin-offering was given for the sacrifice, and righteousness was cast down to the ground; and it practised, and prospered.
027	DAN	008	013	And I heard one saint speaking, and a saint said to a certain one speaking, How long shall the vision continue, [even] the removal of the sacrifice, and the bringing in of the sin of desolation; and [how long] shall the sanctuary and host be trampled?
027	DAN	008	014	And he said to him, Evening and morning [there shall be] two thousand and four hundred days; and [then] the sanctuary shall be cleansed.
027	DAN	008	015	And it came to pass, as I, [even] I Daniel, saw the vision, and sought to understand it, that, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man.
027	DAN	008	016	And I heard the voice of a man between [the banks of] the Ubal; and he called, and said, Gabriel, cause that man to understand the vision.
027	DAN	008	017	And he came and stood near where I stood: and when he came, I was struck with awe, and fell upon my face: but he said to me, Understand, son of man: for yet the vision is for an appointed time.
027	DAN	008	018	And while he spoke with me, I fell upon my face to the earth: and he touched me, and set me on my feet.
027	DAN	008	019	And he said, Behold, I make thee know the things that shall come to pass at the end of the wrath: for the vision [is] yet for an appointed time.
027	DAN	008	020	The ram which thou sawest that had the horns is the king of the Medes and Persians.
027	DAN	008	021	The he-goat is the king of the Greeks: and the great horn which was between his eyes, he is the first king.
027	DAN	008	022	And [as for] the one that was broken, in whose place there stood up four horns, four kings shall arise out of his nation, but not in their [own] strength.
027	DAN	008	023	And at the latter time of their kingdom, when their sins are coming to the full, there shall arise a king bold in countenance, and understanding riddles.
027	DAN	008	024	And his power [shall be] great, and he shall destroy wonderfully, and prosper, and practise, and shall destroy mighty men, and the holy people.
027	DAN	008	025	And the yoke of his chain shall prosper: [there is] craft in his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and by craft shall destroy many, and he shall stand up for the destruction of many, and shall crush them as eggs in his hand.
027	DAN	008	026	And the vision of the evening and morning that was mentioned is true: and do thou seal the vision; for [it is] for many days.
027	DAN	008	027	And I Daniel fell asleep, and was sick: then I arose, and did the king’s business; and I wondered at the vision, and there was none that understood [it].
027	DAN	009	001	In the first year of Darius the son of Assuerus, of the seed of the Medes, who reigned over the kingdom of the Chaldeans,
027	DAN	009	002	I Daniel understood by books the number of the years which was the word of the Lord to the prophet Jeremias, [even] seventy years for the accomplishment of the desolation of Jerusalem.
027	DAN	009	003	And I set my face toward the Lord God, to seek [him] diligently by prayer and supplications, with fastings and sackcloth.
027	DAN	009	004	And I prayed to the Lord my God, and confessed, and said, O Lord, the great and wonderful God, keeping thy covenant and thy mercy to them that love thee, and to them that keep thy commandments; we have sinned,
027	DAN	009	005	we have done iniquity, we have transgressed, and we have departed and turned aside from thy commandments and from thy judgments:
027	DAN	009	006	and we have not hearkened to thy servants the prophets, who spoke in thy name to our kings, and our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land.
027	DAN	009	007	To thee, O Lord, [belongs] righteousness, and to us confusion of face, as at this day; to the men of Juda, and to the dwellers in Jerusalem, and to all Israel, to them that are near, and to them that are far off in all the earth, wherever thou hast scattered them, for the sin which they committed.
027	DAN	009	008	In thee, O Lord, is our righteousness, and to us [belongs] confusion of face, and to our kings, and to our princes, and to our fathers, forasmuch as we have sinned.
027	DAN	009	009	To thee, the Lord our God, [belong] compassions and forgivenesses, whereas we have departed [from thee];
027	DAN	009	010	neither have we hearkened to the voice of the Lord our God, to walk in his laws, which he set before us by the hands of his servants the prophets.
027	DAN	009	011	Moreover all Israel have transgressed thy law, and have refused to hearken to thy voice; so the curse has come upon us, and the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God, because we have sinned against him.
027	DAN	009	012	And he has confirmed his words, which he spoke against us, and against our judges who judged us, [by] bringing upon us great evils, such as have not happened under the whole heaven, according to what has happened in Jerusalem.
027	DAN	009	013	As it is written in the law of Moses, all these evils have come upon us: yet we have not besought the Lord our God, that we might turn away from our iniquities, and have understanding in all thy truth.
027	DAN	009	014	The Lord also has watched, and brought the evils upon us: for the Lord our God is righteous in all his work which he has executed, but we have not hearkened to his voice.
027	DAN	009	015	And now, O Lord our God, who broughtest thy people out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and madest to thyself a name, as [at] this day; we have sinned, we have transgressed.
027	DAN	009	016	O Lord, thy mercy is over all: let, I pray thee, thy wrath turn away, and thine anger from thy city Jerusalem, [even] thy holy mountain: for we have sinned, and because of our iniquities, and those of our fathers, Jerusalem and thy people are become a reproach among all that are round about us.
027	DAN	009	017	And now, O Lord our God, hearken to the prayer of thy servant, and his supplications, and cause thy face to shine on thy desolate sanctuary, for thine [own] sake, O Lord.
027	DAN	009	018	Incline thine ear, O my God, and hear; open thine eyes and behold our desolation, and that of thy city on which thy name is called: for we do not bring our pitiful case before thee on [the ground of] our righteousness, but on [the ground of] thy manifold compassions, O Lord.
027	DAN	009	019	Hearken, O Lord; be propitious, O Lord; attend, O Lord; delay not, O my God, for thine own sake: for thy name is called upon thy city and upon thy people.
027	DAN	009	020	And while I was yet speaking, and praying, and confessing my sins and the sins of my people Israel, and bringing my pitiful case before the Lord my God concerning the holy mountain;
027	DAN	009	021	yea, while I was yet speaking in prayer, behold the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, [came] flying, and he touched me about the hour of the evening sacrifice.
027	DAN	009	022	And he instructed me, and spoke with me, and said, O Daniel, I am now come forth to impart to thee understanding.
027	DAN	009	023	At the beginning of thy supplication the word came forth, and I am come to tell thee; for thou art a man much beloved: therefore consider the matter, understand the vision.
027	DAN	009	024	Seventy weeks have been determined upon thy people, and upon the holy city, for sin to be ended, and to seal up transgressions, and to blot out the iniquities, and to make atonement for iniquities, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal the vision and the prophet, and to anoint the Most Holy.
027	DAN	009	025	And thou shalt know and understand, that from the going forth of the command for the answer and for the building of Jerusalem until Christ the prince [there shall be] seven weeks, and sixty-two weeks: and then [the time] shall return, and the street shall be built, and the wall, and the times shall be exhausted.
027	DAN	009	026	And after the sixty-two weeks, the anointed one shall be destroyed, and there is no judgment in him: and he shall destroy the city and the sanctuary with the prince that is coming: they shall be cut off with a flood, and to the end of the war which is rapidly completed he shall appoint [the city] to desolations.
027	DAN	009	027	And one week shall establish the covenant with many: and in the midst of the week my sacrifice and drink-offering shall be taken away: and on the temple [shall be] the abomination of desolations; and at the end of the time an end shall be put to the desolation.
027	DAN	010	001	In the third year of Cyrus king of the Persians a thing was revealed to Daniel, whose name was called Baltasar; and the thing was true, and great power and understanding in the vision was given to him.
027	DAN	010	002	In those days I Daniel was mourning three full weeks.
027	DAN	010	003	I ate no pleasant bread, and no flesh or wine entered into my mouth, neither did I anoint myself with oil, until three whole weeks were accomplished.
027	DAN	010	004	On the twenty-fourth day of the first month, I was near the great river, which is Tigris Eddekel.
027	DAN	010	005	And I lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a man clothed in linen, and his loins were girt with gold of Ophaz:
027	DAN	010	006	and his body was as Tharsis, and his face was as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire, and his arms and his legs as the appearance of shining brass, and the voice of his words as the voice of a multitude.
027	DAN	010	007	And I Daniel only saw the vision: and the men that were with me saw not the vision; but a great amazement fell upon them, and they fled in fear.
027	DAN	010	008	So I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there was no strength left in me, and my glory was turned into corruption, and I retained no strength.
027	DAN	010	009	Yet I heard the voice of his words: and when I heard him I was pricked [in the heart], and [I fell with] my face to the earth.
027	DAN	010	010	And, behold, a hand touched me, and it raised me on my knees.
027	DAN	010	011	And he said to me, O Daniel, man greatly beloved, understand the words which I speak to thee, and stand upright: for I am now sent to thee. And when he had spoken to me this word, I stood trembling.
027	DAN	010	012	And he said to me, Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day that thou didst set thine heart to understand, and to afflict thyself before the Lord thy God, thy words were heard, and I am come because of thy words.
027	DAN	010	013	But the prince of the kingdom of the Persians withstood me twenty-one days: and behold, Michael, one of the princes, came to help me; and I left him there with the chief of the kingdom of the Persians:
027	DAN	010	014	and I have come to inform thee of all that shall befall thy people in the last days: for the vision is yet for [many] days.
027	DAN	010	015	And when he had spoken with me according to these words, I turned my face to the ground, and was pricked [in the heart].
027	DAN	010	016	And, behold, as it were the likeness of a son of man touched my lips; and I opened my mouth, and spoke, and said to him that stood before me, O [my] lord, at the sight of thee my bowels were turned within me, and I had no strength.
027	DAN	010	017	And how shall thy servant be able, O [my] lord, to speak with this my lord? and as for me, from henceforth strength will not remain in me, and there is no breath left in me.
027	DAN	010	018	And there touched me again as it were the appearance of a man, and he strengthened me,
027	DAN	010	019	and said to me, Fear not, man greatly beloved: peace be to thee, quit thyself like a man, and be strong. And when he had spoken with me, I received strength, and said, Let my lord speak; for thou hast strengthened me.
027	DAN	010	020	And he said, Knowest thou, wherefore I am come to thee? and now I will return to fight with the prince of the Persians: and I was going in, and the prince of the Greeks came.
027	DAN	010	021	But I will tell thee that which is ordained in the scripture of truth: and there is no one that holds with me in these matters but Michael your prince.
027	DAN	011	001	And I in the first year of Cyrus stood to strengthen and confirm [him].
027	DAN	011	002	And now I will tell thee the truth. Behold, there shall yet rise up three kings in Persia: and the fourth shall be very far richer than all: and after that he is master of his wealth, he shall rise up against all the kingdoms of the Greeks.
027	DAN	011	003	And there shall rise up a mighty king, and he shall be lord of a great empire, and shall do according to his will.
027	DAN	011	004	And when his kingdom shall stand up, it shall be broken, and shall be divided to the four winds of heaven; but not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion which he ruled over: for his kingdom shall be plucked up, and [given] to others beside these.
027	DAN	011	005	And the king of the south shall be strong; and one of their princes shall prevail against him, and shall obtain a great dominion.
027	DAN	011	006	And after his years they shall associate; and the daughter of the king of the south shall come to the king of the north, to make agreements with him: but she shall not retain power of arm; neither shall his seed stand: and she shall be delivered up, and they that brought her, and the maiden, and he that strengthened her in these times.
027	DAN	011	007	[But] out of the flower of her root there shall arise [one on] his place, and shall come against the host, and shall enter into the strongholds of the king of the north, and shall fight against them, and prevail.
027	DAN	011	008	Yea, he shall carry with a body of captives into Egypt their gods with their molten [images, and] all their precious vessels of silver and gold; and he shall last longer than the king of the north.
027	DAN	011	009	And he shall enter into the kingdom of the king of the south, and shall return to his own land.
027	DAN	011	010	And his sons shall gather a multitude among many: and one shall certainly come, and overflow, and pass through, and he shall rest, and collect his strength.
027	DAN	011	011	And the king of the south shall be greatly enraged, and shall come forth, and shall war with the king of the north: and he shall raise a great multitude; but the multitude shall be delivered into his hand.
027	DAN	011	012	And he shall take the multitude, and his heart shall be exalted; and he shall cast down many thousands; but he shall not prevail.
027	DAN	011	013	For the king of the north shall return, and bring a multitude greater than the former, and at the end of the times of years an invading army shall come with a great force, and with much substance.
027	DAN	011	014	And in those times many shall rise up against the king of the south; and the children of the spoilers of thy people shall exalt themselves to establish the vision; and they shall fail.
027	DAN	011	015	And the king of the north shall come in, and cast up a mound, and take strong cities: and the arms of the king of the south shall withstand, and his chosen ones shall rise up, but there shall be no strength to stand.
027	DAN	011	016	And he that comes in against him shall do according to his will, and there is no one to stand before him: and he shall stand in the land of beauty, and it shall be consumed by his hand.
027	DAN	011	017	And he shall set his face to come in with the force of his whole kingdom, and shall cause everything to prosper with him: and he shall give him the daughter of women to corrupt her: but she shall not continue, neither be on his side.
027	DAN	011	018	And he shall turn his face to the islands, and shall take many, and cause princes to cease from their reproach: nevertheless his own reproach shall return to him.
027	DAN	011	019	Then he shall turn back his face to the strength of his own land: but he shall become weak, and fall, and not be found.
027	DAN	011	020	And there shall arise out of his root one that shall cause a plant of the kingdom to pass over his place, earning kingly glory: and yet in those days shall he be broken, yet not openly, nor in war.
027	DAN	011	021	[One] shall stand on his place, [who] has been set at nought, and they have not put upon him the honour of the kingdom: but he shall come in prosperously, and obtain the kingdom by deceitful ways.
027	DAN	011	022	And the arms of him that overflows shall be washed away as with a flood from before him, and shall be broken, and [so shall be] the head of the covenant.
027	DAN	011	023	And because of the leagues made with him he shall work deceit: and he shall come up, and overpower them with a small nation.
027	DAN	011	024	And he shall enter with prosperity, and [that] into fertile districts; and he shall do what his fathers and his fathers’ fathers have not done; he shall scatter among them plunder, and spoils, and wealth; and he shall devise plans against Egypt, even for a time.
027	DAN	011	025	And his strength and his heart shall be stirred up against the king of the south with a great force; and the king of the south shall engage in war with a great and very strong force; but [his forces] shall not stand, for they shall devise plans against him:
027	DAN	011	026	and they shall eat his provisions, and shall crush him, and he shall carry away armies as with a flood, and many shall fall down slain.
027	DAN	011	027	And [as for] both the kings, their hearts [are set] upon mischief, and they shall speak lies at one table; but it shall not prosper; for yet the end is for a [fixed] time.
027	DAN	011	028	And he shall return to his land with much substance; and his heart [shall be] against the holy covenant; and he shall perform [great deeds], and return to his own land.
027	DAN	011	029	At the [set] time he shall return, and shall come into the south, but the last [expedition] shall [not] be as the first.
027	DAN	011	030	For the Citians issuing forth shall come against him, and he shall be brought low, and shall return, and shall be incensed against the holy covenant: and he shall do [thus], and shall return, and have intelligence with them that have forsaken the holy covenant.
027	DAN	011	031	And seeds shall spring up out of him, and they shall profane the sanctuary of strength, and they shall remove the perpetual [sacrifice], and make the abomination desolate.
027	DAN	011	032	And the transgressors shall bring about a covenant by deceitful ways: but a people knowing their God shall prevail, and do [valiantly].
027	DAN	011	033	And the intelligent of the people shall understand much: yet they shall fall by the sword, and by flame, and by captivity, and by spoil of [many] days.
027	DAN	011	034	And when they are weak they shall be helped with a little help: but many shall attach themselves to them with treachery.
027	DAN	011	035	And [some] of them that understand shall fall, to try them as with fire, and to test [them], and that they may be manifested at the time of the end, for the matter [is] yet for a [set] time.
027	DAN	011	036	And he shall do according to his will, and the king shall exalt and magnify himself against every god, and shall speak great swelling words, and shall prosper until the indignation shall be accomplished: for it is coming to an end.
027	DAN	011	037	And he shall not regard any gods of his fathers, nor the desire of women, neither shall he regard any deity: for he shall magnify himself above all.
027	DAN	011	038	And he shall honour the god of forces on his place: and a god whom his fathers knew not he shall honour with gold, and silver, and precious stones, and desirable things.
027	DAN	011	039	And he shall do [thus] in the strong places of refuge with a strange god, and shall increase his glory: and he shall subject many to them, and shall distribute the land in gifts.
027	DAN	011	040	And at the end of the time he shall conflict with the king of the south: and the king of the north shall come against him with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and they shall enter into the land: and he shall break in pieces, and pass on:
027	DAN	011	041	and he shall enter into the land of beauty, and many shall fail: but these shall escape out of his hand, Edom, and, Moab, and the chief of the children of Ammon.
027	DAN	011	042	And he shall stretch forth [his] hand over the land; and the land of Egypt shall not escape.
027	DAN	011	043	And he shall have the mastery over the secret [treasures] of gold and silver, and over all the desirable [possessions] of Egypt, and of the Libyans and Ethiopians in their strongholds.
027	DAN	011	044	But rumours and anxieties out of the east and from the north shall trouble him; and he shall come with great wrath to destroy many.
027	DAN	011	045	And he shall pitch the tabernacle of his palace between the seas in the holy mountain of beauty: [but] he shall come to his portion, and there is none to deliver him.
027	DAN	012	001	And at that time Michael the great prince shall stand up, that stands over the children of thy people: and there shall be a time of tribulation, such tribulation as has not been from the time that there was a nation on the earth until that time: at that time thy people shall be delivered, [even] every one that is written in the book.
027	DAN	012	002	And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to reproach and everlasting shame.
027	DAN	012	003	And the wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament, and [some] of the many righteous as the stars for ever and ever.
027	DAN	012	004	And thou, Daniel, close the words, and seal the book to the time of the end; until many are taught, and knowledge is increased.
027	DAN	012	005	And I Daniel saw, and, behold, two others stood, one on one side of the bank of the river, and the other on the other side of the bank of the river.
027	DAN	012	006	And [one] said to the man clothed in linen, who was over the water of the river, When [will be] the end of the wonders which thou hast mentioned?
027	DAN	012	007	And I heard the man clothed in linen, who was over the water of the river, and he lifted up his right hand and his left hand to heaven, and sware by him that lives for ever, that [it should be] for a time of times and half a time: when the dispersion is ended they shall know all these things.
027	DAN	012	008	And I heard, but I understood not: and I said, O Lord, what [will be] the end of these things?
027	DAN	012	009	And he said, Go, Daniel: for the words are closed and sealed up to the time of the end.
027	DAN	012	010	Many must be tested, and thoroughly whitened, and tried with fire, and sanctified; but the transgressors shall transgress: and none of the transgressors shall understand; but the wise shall understand.
027	DAN	012	011	And from the time of the removal of the perpetual sacrifice, when the abomination of desolation shall be set up, [there shall be] a thousand two hundred and ninety days.
027	DAN	012	012	Blessed is he that waits, and comes to the thousand three hundred and thirty-five days.
027	DAN	012	013	But go thou, and rest; for [there are] yet days and seasons to the fulfilment of the end; and thou shalt stand in thy lot at the end of the days.

# BOOK	028	HOS	Hosea	Osee
028	HOS	001	001	The word of the Lord which came to Osee the son of Beeri, in the days of Ozias, and Joatham, and Achaz, and Ezekias, kings of Juda, and in the days of Jeroboam son of Joas, king of Israel.
028	HOS	001	002	The beginning of the word of the Lord by Osee. And the Lord said to Osee, Go, take to thyself a wife of fornication, and children of fornication: for the land will surely go a-whoring in departing from the Lord.
028	HOS	001	003	So he went and took Gomer, daughter of Debelaim; and she conceived, and bore him a son.
028	HOS	001	004	And the Lord said to him, Call his name Jezrael; for yet a little [while], and I will avenge the blood of Jezrael on the house of Juda, and will make to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel.
028	HOS	001	005	And it shall be, in that day, [that] I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezrael.
028	HOS	001	006	And she conceived again, and bore a daughter. And he said to him, Call her name, Unpitied: for I will no more have mercy on the house of Israel, but will surely set myself in array against them.
028	HOS	001	007	But I will have mercy on the house of Juda, and will save them by the Lord their God, and will not save them with bow, nor with sword, nor by war, nor by horses, nor by horsemen.
028	HOS	001	008	And she weaned Unpitied; and she conceived again, and bore a son.
028	HOS	001	009	And he said, Call his name, Not my people: for ye are not my people, and I am not your [God].
028	HOS	001	010	Yet the number of the children of Israel was as the sand of the sea, which shall not be measured nor numbered: and it shall come to pass, [that] in the place where it was said to them, Ye are not my people, even they shall be called the sons of the living God.
028	HOS	001	011	And the children of Juda shall be gathered, and the children of Israel together, and shall appoint themselves one head, and shall come up out of the land: for great [shall be] the day of Jezrael.
028	HOS	002	001	Say to your brother, My people, and to your sister, Pitied.
028	HOS	002	002	Plead with your mother, plead: for she is not my wife, and I am not her husband: and I will remove her fornication out of my presence, and her adultery from between her breasts:
028	HOS	002	003	that I may strip her naked, and make her again as she was at the day of her birth: and I will make her desolate, and make her as a dry land, and will kill her with thirst.
028	HOS	002	004	And I will not have mercy upon her children; for they are children of fornication.
028	HOS	002	005	And their mother went a-whoring: she that bore them disgraced [them]: for she said, I will go after my lovers, that give me my bread and my water, and my garments, and my linen clothes, my oil and my necessaries.
028	HOS	002	006	Therefore, behold, I hedge up her way with thorns, and I will stop the ways, and she shall not find her path.
028	HOS	002	007	And she shall follow after her lovers, and shall not overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find them: and she shall say, I will go, and return to my former husband; for it was better with me than now.
028	HOS	002	008	And she knew not that I gave her her corn, and wine, and oil, and multiplied silver to her: but she made silver and gold [images] for Baal.
028	HOS	002	009	Therefore I will return, and take away my corn in its season, and my wine in its time; and I will take away my raiment and my linen clothes, so that she shall not cover her nakedness.
028	HOS	002	010	And now I will expose her uncleanness before her lovers, and no one shall by any means deliver her out of my hand.
028	HOS	002	011	And I will take away all her gladness, her feasts, and her festivals at the new moon, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn assemblies.
028	HOS	002	012	And I will utterly destroy her vines, and her fig-trees, all things of which she said, These are my hire which my lovers have given me: and I will make them a testimony, and the wild beasts of the field, and the birds of the sky, and the reptiles of the earth shall devour them.
028	HOS	002	013	And I will recompense on her the days of Baalim, wherein she sacrificed to them, and put on her ear-rings, and her necklaces, and went after her lovers, and forgot me, saith the Lord.
028	HOS	002	014	Therefore, behold, I [will] cause her to err, and will make her as desolate, and will speak comfortably to her.
028	HOS	002	015	And I will giver her possessions from thence, and the valley of Achor to open her understanding: and she shall be afflicted there according to the days of her infancy, and according to the days of her coming up out of the land of Egypt.
028	HOS	002	016	And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord, [that] she shall call me, My husband, and shall no longer call me Baalim.
028	HOS	002	017	And I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth, and their names shall be remembered no more at all.
028	HOS	002	018	And I will make for them in that day a covenant with the wild beasts of the field, and with the birds of the sky, and with the reptiles of the earth: and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle from off the earth, and will cause thee to dwell safely.
028	HOS	002	019	And I will betroth thee to myself for ever; yea, I will betroth thee to myself in righteousness, and in judgment, and in mercy, and in tender compassions;
028	HOS	002	020	and I will betroth thee to myself in faithfulness: and thou shalt know the Lord.
028	HOS	002	021	And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord, I will hearken to the heaven, and it shall hearken to the earth;
028	HOS	002	022	and the earth shall hearken to the corn, and the wine, and the oil; and they shall hearken to Jezrael.
028	HOS	002	023	And I will sow her to me on the earth; and will love her that was not loved, and will say to that which was not my people, Thou art my people; and they shall say, Thou art the Lord my God.
028	HOS	003	001	And the Lord said to me, Go yet, and love a woman that loves evil things, an adulteress, even as the Lord loves the children of Israel, and they have respect to strange gods, and love cakes of dried grapes.
028	HOS	003	002	So I hired [her] to myself for fifteen [pieces] of silver, and a homer of barley, and a flagon of wine.
028	HOS	003	003	And I said unto her, Thou shalt wait for me many days; and thou shalt not commit fornication, neither shalt thou be for [another] man; and I [will be] for thee.
028	HOS	003	004	For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an altar, and without a priesthood, and without manifestations.
028	HOS	003	005	And afterward shall the children of Israel return, and shall seek the Lord their God, and David their king; and shall be amazed at the Lord and at his goodness in the latter days.
028	HOS	004	001	Hear the word of the Lord, ye children of Israel: for the Lord [has] a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land.
028	HOS	004	002	Cursing, and lying, and murder, and theft, and adultery abound in the land, and they mingle blood with blood.
028	HOS	004	003	Therefore shall the land mourn, and shall be diminished with all that dwell in it, with the wild beasts of the field, and the reptiles of the earth, and with the birds of the sky, and the fish of the sea shall fail:
028	HOS	004	004	that neither any one may plead, nor any one reprove [another]; but my people are as a priest spoken against.
028	HOS	004	005	Therefore they shall fall by day, and the prophet with thee shall fall: I have compared thy mother unto night.
028	HOS	004	006	My people are like as if they had no knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt not minister as priest to me: and [as] thou has forgotten the law of thy God, I also will forget thy children.
028	HOS	004	007	According to their multitude, so they sinned against me: I will turn their glory into shame.
028	HOS	004	008	They will devour the sins of my people, and will set their hearts on their iniquities.
028	HOS	004	009	And the priest shall be as the people: and I will avenge on them their ways, and I will recompense to them their counsels.
028	HOS	004	010	And they shall eat, and shall not be satisfied: they have gone a-whoring, and shall by no means prosper: because they have left off to take heed to the Lord.
028	HOS	004	011	The heart of my people has gladly engaged in fornication and wine and strong drink.
028	HOS	004	012	They asked counsel by [means of] signs, and they reported answer to them by their staves: they have gone astray in a spirit of whoredom, and gone grievously a-whoring from their God.
028	HOS	004	013	They have sacrificed on the tops of the mountains, and on the hills they have sacrificed under the oak and poplar, and under the shady tree, because the shade was good: therefore your daughters shall go a-whoring, and your daughters-in-law shall commit adultery.
028	HOS	004	014	And I will not visit upon your daughters when they shall commit fornication, nor your daughters-in-law when they shall commit adultery: for they themselves mingled themselves with harlots, and sacrificed with polluted ones, and the people that understood not entangled itself with a harlot.
028	HOS	004	015	But thou, O Israel, be not ignorant, and go ye not, [men of] Juda, to Galgala; and go not up to the house of On, and swear not by the living Lord.
028	HOS	004	016	For Israel was maddened like a mad heifer: now the Lord will feed them as a lamb in a wide place.
028	HOS	004	017	Ephraim, joined with idols, has laid stumbling-blocks in his own way.
028	HOS	004	018	He has chosen the Chananites: they have grievously gone a-whoring: they have loved dishonour through her insolence.
028	HOS	004	019	Thou art a blast of wind in her wings, and they shall be ashamed because of their altars.
028	HOS	005	001	Hear these things, ye priests; and attend, O house of Israel; and hearken, O house of the king; for the controversy is with you, because ye have been a snare in Scopia, and as a net spread on Itabyrium,
028	HOS	005	002	which they that hunt the prey have fixed: but I will correct you.
028	HOS	005	003	I know Ephraim, and Israel is not far from me: for now Ephraim has gone grievously a-whoring, Israel is defiled.
028	HOS	005	004	They have not framed their counsels to return to their God, for the spirit of fornication is in them, and they have not known the Lord.
028	HOS	005	005	And the pride of Israel shall be brought low before his face; and Israel and Ephraim shall fall in their iniquities; and Judas also shall fall with them.
028	HOS	005	006	They shall go with sheep and calves diligently to seek the Lord; but they shall not find him, for he has withdrawn himself from them.
028	HOS	005	007	For they have forsaken the Lord; for strange children have been born to them: now shall the cankerworm devour them and their heritages.
028	HOS	005	008	Blow ye the trumpet on the hills, sound aloud on the heights: proclaim in the house of On, Benjamin is amazed.
028	HOS	005	009	Ephraim has come to nought in the days of reproof: in the tribes of Israel I have shown faithful [dealings].
028	HOS	005	010	The princes of Juda became as they that removed the bounds: I will pour out upon them my fury as water.
028	HOS	005	011	Ephraim altogether prevailed against his adversary, he trod judgment under foot, for he began to go after vanities.
028	HOS	005	012	Therefore I [will be] as consternation to Ephraim, and as a goad to the house of Juda.
028	HOS	005	013	And Ephraim saw his disease, and Judas his pain; then Ephraim went to the Assyrians, and sent ambassadors to king Jarim: but he could not heal you, and your pain shall in nowise cease from you.
028	HOS	005	014	Wherefore I am as a panther to Ephraim, and as a lion to the house of Juda: and I will tear, and go away; and I will take, and there shall be none to deliver.
028	HOS	005	015	I will go and return to my place, until they are brought to nought, and [then] shall they seek my face.
028	HOS	006	001	In their affliction they will seek me early, saying, Let us go, and return to the Lord our God; for he has torn, and will heal us; he will smite, and bind us up.
028	HOS	006	002	After two days he will heal us: in the third day we shall arise, and live before him, and shall know [him]:
028	HOS	006	003	let us follow on to know the Lord: we shall find him ready as the morning, and he will come to us as the early and latter rain to the earth.
028	HOS	006	004	What shall I do unto thee, Ephraim? What shall I do to thee, Juda? whereas your mercy is as a morning cloud, and as the early dew that goes away.
028	HOS	006	005	Therefore have I mown down your prophets; I have slain them with the word of my mouth: and my judgment shall go forth as the light.
028	HOS	006	006	For I will [have] mercy rather than sacrifice, and the knowledge of God rather than whole-burnt-offerings.
028	HOS	006	007	But they are as a man transgressing a covenant:
028	HOS	006	008	there the city Galaad despised me, working vanity, troubling water.
028	HOS	006	009	And thy strength [is that] of a robber: the priests have hid the way, they have murdered [the people of] Sicima; for they have wrought iniquity in the house of Israel.
028	HOS	006	010	I have seen horrible [things] there, [even] the fornication of Ephraim: Israel and Juda are defiled;
028	HOS	006	011	begin together grapes for thyself, when I turn the captivity of my people.
028	HOS	007	001	When I have healed Israel, then shall the iniquity of Ephraim be revealed, and the wickedness of Samaria; for they have wrought falsehood: and a thief shall come in to him, [even] a robber spoiling in his way;
028	HOS	007	002	that they may concert together as [men] singing in their heart: I remember all their wickedness: now have their own counsels compassed them about; they came before my face.
028	HOS	007	003	They gladdened kings with their wickedness, and princes with their lies.
028	HOS	007	004	They are all adulterers, as an oven glowing with flame for hot-baking, on account of the kneading of the dough, until it is leavened.
028	HOS	007	005	[In] the days of our kings, the princes began to be inflamed with wine: he stretched out his hand with pestilent fellows.
028	HOS	007	006	Wherefore their hearts are inflamed as an oven, while they rage all the night: Ephraim is satisfied with sleep; the morning is come; he is burnt up as a flame of fire.
028	HOS	007	007	They are all heated like an oven, and have devoured their judges: all their kings are fallen; there was not among them one that called on me.
028	HOS	007	008	Ephraim is mixed among his people; Ephraim became a cake not turned.
028	HOS	007	009	Strangers devoured his strength, and he knew [it] not; and grey hairs came upon him, and he knew [it] not.
028	HOS	007	010	And the pride of Israel shall be brought down before his face: yet they have not returned to the Lord their God, neither have they diligently sought him for all this.
028	HOS	007	011	And Ephraim was as a silly dove, not having a heart: he called to Egypt, and they went to the Assyrians.
028	HOS	007	012	Whenever they shall go, I will cast my net upon them; I will bring them down as the birds of the sky, I will chasten them with the rumor of their [coming] affliction.
028	HOS	007	013	Woe to them! for they have started aside from me: they are cowards; for they have sinned against me: yet I redeemed them, but they spoke falsehoods against me.
028	HOS	007	014	And their hearts did not cry to me, but they howled on their beds: they pined for oil and wine.
028	HOS	007	015	They were instructed by me, and I strengthened their arms; and they devised evils against me.
028	HOS	007	016	They turned aside to that which is not, they became as a bent bow: their princes shall fall by the sword, by reason of the unbridled state of their tongue: this is their setting at nought in the land of Egypt.
028	HOS	008	001	[He shall come] into their midst as the land, as an eagle against the house of the Lord, because they have transgressed my covenant, and have sinned against my law.
028	HOS	008	002	They shall soon cry out to me, [saying], O God, we know thee.
028	HOS	008	003	For Israel has turned away from good things; they have pursued an enemy.
028	HOS	008	004	They have made kings for themselves, but not by me: they have ruled, but they did not make it known to me: [of] their silver and their gold they have made images to themselves, that they might be destroyed.
028	HOS	008	005	Cast off thy calf, O Samaria; mine anger is kindled against them: how long will they be unable to purge themselves in Israel?
028	HOS	008	006	Whereas the workman made it, and it is not God; wherefore thy calf, Samaria, was a deceiver:
028	HOS	008	007	for they sowed blighted [seed], and their destruction shall await them, a sheaf of corn that avails not to make meal; and even if it should produce it, strangers shall devour it.
028	HOS	008	008	Israel is swallowed up: now is he become among the nations as a worthless vessel.
028	HOS	008	009	For they have gone up to the Assyrians: Ephraim has been strengthened against himself; they loved gifts.
028	HOS	008	010	Therefore shall they be delivered to the nations: now I will receive them, and they shall cease a little to anoint a king and princes.
028	HOS	008	011	Because Ephraim has multiplied altars, [his] beloved altars are become sins to him.
028	HOS	008	012	I will write down a multitude [of commands] for him; but his statutes are accounted strange things, [even] the beloved altars.
028	HOS	008	013	For if they should offer a sacrifice, and eat flesh, the lord will not accept them: now will he remember their iniquities, and will take vengeance on their sins: they have returned to Egypt, and they shall eat unclean things among the Assyrians.
028	HOS	008	014	And Israel has forgotten him that made him, and they have built fanes, and Juda has multiplied walled cities: but I will send fire on his cities, and it shall devour their foundations.
028	HOS	009	001	Rejoice not, O Israel, neither make merry, as [other] nations: for thou hast gone a-whoring from thy God; thou hast loved gifts upon every threshing-floor.
028	HOS	009	002	The threshing-floor and wine-press knew them not, and the wine disappointed them.
028	HOS	009	003	They dwelt not in the Lord's land: Ephraim dwelt in Egypt, and they shall eat unclean things among the Assyrians.
028	HOS	009	004	They have not offered wine to the Lord, neither have their sacrifices been sweet to him, [but] as the bread of mourning to them; all that eat them shall be defiled; for their bread for their soul shall not enter into the house of the Lord.
028	HOS	009	005	What will ye do in the day of the general assembly, and in the day of the feast of the Lord?
028	HOS	009	006	Therefore, behold, they go forth from the trouble of Egypt, and Memphis shall receive them, and Machmas shall bury them: [as for] their silver, destruction shall inherit it; thorns [shall be] in their tents.
028	HOS	009	007	The days of vengeance are come, the days of thy recompense are come; and Israel shall be afflicted as the prophet that is mad, as a man deranged: by reason of the multitude of thine iniquities thy madness has abounded.
028	HOS	009	008	The watchman of Ephraim [was] with God: the prophet is a crooked snare in all his ways: they have established madness in the house of God.
028	HOS	009	009	They have corrupted themselves according to the days of the hill: he will remember their iniquities, he will take vengeance on their sins.
028	HOS	009	010	I found Israel as grapes in the wilderness, and I saw their fathers as an early watchman in a fig-tree: they went in to Beel-phegor, and were shamefully estranged, and the abominable became as the beloved.
028	HOS	009	011	Ephraim has flown away as a bird; their glories from the birth, and the travail, and the conception.
028	HOS	009	012	For even if they should rear their children, yet shall they be utterly bereaved: wherefore also there is woe to them, [though] my flesh is of them.
028	HOS	009	013	Ephraim, [even] as I saw, gave their children for a prey; yea, Ephraim [was ready] to bring out his children to slaughter.
028	HOS	009	014	Give them, O Lord: what wilt thou give them? a miscarrying womb, and dry breasts.
028	HOS	009	015	All their wickedness is in Galgal: for there I hated them: because of the wickedness of their practices, I will cast them out of my house, I will not love them any more: all their princes are disobedient.
028	HOS	009	016	Ephraim is sick, he is dried up at his roots, he shall in no wise any more bear fruit: wherefore even if they should beget [children], I will kill the desired [fruit] of their womb.
028	HOS	009	017	God shall reject them, because they have not hearkened to him: and they shall be wanderers among the nations.
028	HOS	010	001	Israel is a vine with goodly branches, her fruit is abundant: according to the multitude of her fruits she has multiplied [her] altars; according to the wealth of his land, he has set up pillars.
028	HOS	010	002	They have divided their hearts; now shall they be utterly destroyed: he shall dig down their altars, their pillars shall mourn.
028	HOS	010	003	Because now they shall say, We have no king, because we feared not the Lord:
028	HOS	010	004	and what should a king do for us, speaking false professions [as his] words? he will make a covenant: judgment shall spring up as a weed on the soil of the field.
028	HOS	010	005	The inhabitants of Samaria shall dwell near the calf of the house of On; for the people of it mourned for it: and as they provoked him, they shall rejoice at his glory, because he has departed from them.
028	HOS	010	006	And having bound it for the Assyrians, they carried it away as presents to king Jarim: Ephraim shall receive a gift, and Israel shall be ashamed of his counsel.
028	HOS	010	007	Samaria has cast off her king as a twig on the surface of the water.
028	HOS	010	008	And the altars of On, the sins of Israel, shall be taken away: thorns and thistles shall come up on their altars; and they shall say to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall on us.
028	HOS	010	009	From the time the hills [existed] Israel has sinned: there they stood: war [waged] against the children of iniquity
028	HOS	010	010	to chastise them shall not overtake them on the hill, the nations shall be gathered against them, when they are chastened for their two sins,
028	HOS	010	011	Ephraim is a heifer taught to love victory, but I will come upon the fairest part of her neck: I will mount Ephraim; I will pass over Juda in silence; Jacob shall prevail against him.
028	HOS	010	012	Sow to yourselves for righteousness, gather in for the fruit of life: light ye for yourselves the light of knowledge; seek the Lord till the fruits of righteousness come upon you.
028	HOS	010	013	Wherefore have ye passed over ungodliness in silence, and reaped the sins of it? ye have eaten false fruit; for thou has trusted in thy sins, in the abundance of thy power.
028	HOS	010	014	Therefore shall destruction rise up among thy people, and all thy strong places shall be ruined: as a prince Solomon [departed] out of the house of Jeroboam, in the days of battle they dashed the mother to the ground upon the children,
028	HOS	010	015	thus will I do to you, O house of Israel, because of the unrighteousness of your sins.
028	HOS	011	001	Early in the morning were they cast off, the king of Israel has been cast off: for Israel is a child, and I loved him, and out of Egypt have I called his children.
028	HOS	011	002	As I called them, so they departed from my presence: they sacrificed to Baalim, and burnt incense to graven images.
028	HOS	011	003	Yet I bound the feet of Ephraim, I took him on my arm; but they knew not that I healed them.
028	HOS	011	004	When men were destroyed, I drew them with the bands of my love: and I will be to them as a man smiting [another] on his cheek: and I will have respect to him, I will prevail with him.
028	HOS	011	005	Ephraim dwelt in Egypt; and [as for] the Assyrian, he was his king, because he would not return.
028	HOS	011	006	And in his cities he prevailed not with the sword, and he ceased [to war] with his hands: and they shall eat [of the fruit] of their own devices:
028	HOS	011	007	and his people [shall] cleave fondly to their habitation; but God shall be angry with his precious things, and shall not at all exalt him.
028	HOS	011	008	How shall I deal with thee, Ephraim? [how] shall I protect thee, Israel? what shall I do with thee? I will make thee as Adama, and as Seboim; my heart is turned at once, my repentance is powerfully excited.
028	HOS	011	009	I will not act according to the fury of my wrath, I will not abandon Ephraim to be utterly destroyed: for I am God, and not man; the Holy One within thee: and I will not enter into the city.
028	HOS	011	010	I will go after the Lord: he shall utter [his voice] as a lion: for he shall roar, and the children of the waters shall be amazed.
028	HOS	011	011	They shall be amazed [and fly] as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of the Assyrians: and I will restore them to their houses, saith the Lord.
028	HOS	011	012	Ephraim has compassed me with falsehood, and the house of Israel and Juda with ungodliness: [but] now God knows them, and they shall be called God's holy people.
028	HOS	012	001	But Ephraim is an evil spirit, he has chased the east wind all the day: he has multiplied empty and vain things, and made a covenant with the Assyrians, and oil has gone in the way of traffic into Egypt.
028	HOS	012	002	And the Lord [has] a controversy with Juda, in order to punish Jacob: according to his ways and according to his practices will he recompense him.
028	HOS	012	003	He took his brother by the heel in the womb, and in his labours he had power with God.
028	HOS	012	004	And he prevailed with the angel and was strong: they wept, and intreated me: they found me in the house of On, and there [a word] was spoken to them.
028	HOS	012	005	But the Lord God Almighty shall be his memorial.
028	HOS	012	006	Thou therefore shalt return to thy God: keep thou mercy and judgment, and draw nigh to thy God continually.
028	HOS	012	007	[As for] Chanaan, in his hand is a balance of unrighteousness: he has loved to tyrannize.
028	HOS	012	008	And Ephraim said, Nevertheless I am rich, I have found refreshment to myself. None of his labours shall be found [available] to him, by reason of the sins which he has committed.
028	HOS	012	009	But I the Lord thy God brought thee up out of the land of Egypt: I will yet cause thee to dwell in tabernacles, according to the days of the feast.
028	HOS	012	010	And I will speak to the prophets, and I have multiplied visions, and by the means of the prophets I was represented.
028	HOS	012	011	If Galaad exists not, then the chiefs in Galaad when they sacrificed were false, and their altars were as heaps on the ground of the field.
028	HOS	012	012	And Jacob retreated into the plain of Syria, and Israel served for a wife, and waited for a wife.
028	HOS	012	013	And the Lord brought Israel out of the land of Egypt by a prophet, and by a prophet was he preserve.
028	HOS	012	014	Ephraim was angry and excited, therefore his blood shall be poured out upon him, and the Lord shall recompense to him his reproach.
028	HOS	013	001	According to the word of Ephraim he adopted ordinances for himself in Israel; and he established them for Baal, and died.
028	HOS	013	002	And now they have sinned increasingly, and have made for themselves a molten image of their silver, according to the fashion of idols, the work of artificers accomplished for them: they say, Sacrifice men, for the calves have come to an end.
028	HOS	013	003	Therefore shall they be as a morning cloud, and as the early dew that passes away, as chaff blown away from the threshing-floor, and as a vapor from tears.
028	HOS	013	004	But I am the Lord thy God that establishes the heaven, and creates the earth, whose hands have framed the whole host of heaven: but I shewed them not to thee that thou shouldest go after them: and I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and thou shalt know no God but me; and there is no Saviour beside me.
028	HOS	013	005	I tended thee as a shepherd in the wilderness, in an uninhabited land.
028	HOS	013	006	According to their pastures, so they were completely filled; and their hearts were exalted; therefore they forgot me.
028	HOS	013	007	And I will be to them as a panther, and as a leopard.
028	HOS	013	008	I will meet them by the way of the Assyrians, as a she-bear excited, and I will rend the caul of their heart, and the lions' whelps of the thicket shall devour them there; the wild beasts of the field shall rend them in pieces.
028	HOS	013	009	O Israel, who will aid [thee] in thy destruction?
028	HOS	013	010	Where is this thy king? let him even save thee in all thy cities: let him judge thee, of whom thou saidst, Give me a king and a prince.
028	HOS	013	011	And I gave thee a king in mine anger, and kept [him] back in my wrath.
028	HOS	013	012	Ephraim [has framed] a conspiracy of unrighteousness, his sin is hidden.
028	HOS	013	013	Pains as of a woman in travail shall come upon him: he is thy wise son, because he shall not stay in the destruction of [thy] children.
028	HOS	013	014	I will deliver [them] out of the power of Hades, and will redeem them from death: where is thy penalty, O death? O Hades, where is thy sting? comfort is hidden from mine eyes.
028	HOS	013	015	Forasmuch as he will cause a division among [his] brethren, the Lord shall bring upon him an east wind from the desert, and shall dry up his veins [and] quite drain his fountains: he shall dry up his land, and [spoil] all his precious vessels.
028	HOS	013	016	Samaria shall be utterly destroyed: for she has resisted her God; they shall fall by the sword, and their sucklings shall be dashed against the ground, and their women with child ripped up.
028	HOS	014	001	Return, O Israel, to the Lord thy God; for the people have fallen through thine iniquities.
028	HOS	014	002	Take with you words, and turn to the Lord your God: speak to him, that ye may not receive [the reward of] unrighteousness, but that ye may receive good things: and we will render in return the fruit of our lips.
028	HOS	014	003	Assur shall never save us; we will not mount on horseback; we will no longer say to the works of our hands, Our gods. He who is in thee shall pity the orphan.
028	HOS	014	004	I will restore their dwellings, I will love them truly: for he has turned away my wrath from him.
028	HOS	014	005	I will be as dew to Israel: he shall bloom as the lily, and cast forth his roots as Libanus.
028	HOS	014	006	His branches shall spread, and he shall be as a fruitful olive, and his smell shall be as [the smell] of Libanus.
028	HOS	014	007	They shall return, and dwell under his shadow: they shall live and be satisfied with corn, and he shall flower as a vine: his memorial shall be to Ephraim as the wine of Libanus.
028	HOS	014	008	What [has] he to do any more with idols? I have afflicted him, and I will strengthen him: I am as a leafy juniper tree. From me is thy fruit found.
028	HOS	014	009	Who is wise, and will understand these things? or prudent, and will know them? for the ways of the Lord are straight, and the righteous shall walk in them: but the ungodly shall fall therein.

029	JOE	001	001	The word of the Lord which came to Joel the son of Bathuel.
029	JOE	001	002	Hear these [words], ye elders, and hearken all ye that inhabit the land. Have such things happen in your days, or in the days of your fathers?

029	JOE	001	004	The leavings of the caterpillar has the locust eaten, and the leavings of the locust has the palmerworm eaten, and the leavings of the palmerworm has the cankerworm eaten.
029	JOE	001	005	Awake, ye drunkards, from your wine, and weep: mourn, all ye that drink wine to drunkenness: for joy and gladness and removed are from your mouth.
029	JOE	001	006	For a strong and innumerable nation is come up against my land, their teeth are lion's teeth, and their back teeth those of a [lion's] whelp.
029	JOE	001	007	He has ruined my vine, and utterly broken my fig-trees: he has utterly searched [my vine], and cast it down; he has peeled its branches.
029	JOE	001	008	Lament to me more than a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth.
029	JOE	001	009	The meat-offering and drink-offering are removed from the house of the Lord: mourn, ye priests that serve at the altar of the Lord.
029	JOE	001	010	For the plains languish: let the land mourn, for the corn languishes; the wine is dried up, the oil becomes scarce;
029	JOE	001	011	the husbandmen are consumed: mourn your property on account of the wheat and barley; for the harvest has perished from off the field.
029	JOE	001	012	The vine is dried up, and the fig-trees are become few; the pomegranate, and palm-tree, and apple, and all trees of the field are dried up: for the sons of men have have abolished joy.
029	JOE	001	013	Gird yourselves [with sackcloth], and lament, ye priests: mourn, ye that serve at the altar: go in, sleep in sackcloths, ye that minister to God: for the meat-offering and drink-offering are withheld from the house of your God.
029	JOE	001	014	Sanctify a fast, proclaim a [solemn] service, gather the elders [and] all the inhabitants of the land into the house of your God, and cry earnestly to the Lord,
029	JOE	001	015	Alas, Alas, Alas for the day! for the day of the Lord is nigh, and it will come as trouble upon trouble.
029	JOE	001	016	[Your] meat has been destroyed before your eyes, joy and gladness from out of the house of your God.
029	JOE	001	017	The heifers have started at their mangers, the treasures are abolished, the wine-presses are broken down; for the corn is withered.
029	JOE	001	018	What shall we store up for ourselves? the herds of cattle have mourned, because they had no pasture; and the flocks of sheep have been utterly destroyed.
029	JOE	001	019	To thee, O Lord, will I cry: for fire has devoured the fair places of the wilderness, and a flame has burnt up all the trees of the field.
029	JOE	001	020	And the cattle of the field have looked up to thee: for the fountains of waters have been dried up, and fire has devoured the fair places of the wilderness.
029	JOE	002	001	Sound the trumpet in Sion, make a proclamation in my holy mountain, and let all the inhabitants of the land be confounded: for the day of the Lord is near;
029	JOE	002	002	for a day of darkness and gloominess is near, a day of cloud and mist: a numerous and strong people shall be spread upon the mountains as the morning; there has not been from the beginning one like it, and after it there shall not be again even to the years of many generations.
029	JOE	002	003	Before them is a consuming fire, and behind them is a flame kindled: the land before them is as a paradise of delight, and behind them a desolate plain: and there shall none of them escape.
029	JOE	002	004	Their appearance is as the appearance of horses; and as horsemen, so shall they pursue.
029	JOE	002	005	As the sound of chariots on the tops of mountains shall they leap, and as the sound of a flame of fire devouring stubble, and as a numerous and strong people setting themselves in array for battle.
029	JOE	002	006	Before them shall the people be crushed: every face [shall be] as the blackness of a caldron.
029	JOE	002	007	As warriors shall they run, and as men of war shall they mount on the walls; and each shall move in his [right] path, and they shall not turn aside from their tracks:
029	JOE	002	008	and not one shall stand aloof from his brother: they shall go on weighed down with their arms, and they fall upon their weapons, yet shall they in no wise be destroyed.
029	JOE	002	009	They shall seize upon the city, and run upon the walls, and go up upon the houses, and enter in through the windows as thieves.
029	JOE	002	010	Before them the earth shall be confounded, and the sky shall be shaken: the sun and the moon shall be darkened, and the stars shall withdraw their light.
029	JOE	002	011	And the Lord shall utter his voice before his host: for his camp is very great: for the execution of his words is mighty: for the day of the Lord is great, very glorious, and who shall be able to [resist] it?
029	JOE	002	012	Now therefore, saith the Lord your God, turn to me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with lamentation:
029	JOE	002	013	and rend your hearts, and not your garments, and turn to the Lord your God: for he is merciful and compassionate, long-suffering, and plenteous in mercy, and repents of evils.
029	JOE	002	014	Who knows if he will return, and repent, and leave a blessing behind him, even a meat-offering and a drink-offering to the Lord your God?
029	JOE	002	015	Sound the trumpet in Sion, sanctify a fast, proclaim a [solemn] service:
029	JOE	002	016	gather the people, sanctify the congregation, assemble the elders, gather the infants at the breast: let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber, and the bride out of her closet.
029	JOE	002	017	Between the porch and the altar let the priests that minister to the Lord weep, and say, Spare thy people, O Lord, and give not thine heritage to reproach, that the heathen should rule over them, lest they should say among the heathen, Where is their God?
029	JOE	002	018	But the Lord was jealous of his land, and spared his people.
029	JOE	002	019	And the Lord answered and said to his people, Behold, I [will] send you corn, and wine, and oil, and ye shall be satisfied with them: and I will no longer make you a reproach among the Gentiles.
029	JOE	002	020	And I will chase away from you the northern [adversary], and will drive him away into a dry land, and I will sink his face in the former sea, and his back parts in the latter sea, and his ill savour shall come up, and his stink come up, because he has wrought great things.
029	JOE	002	021	Be of good courage, O land; rejoice and be glad: for the Lord has done great things.
029	JOE	002	022	Be of good courage, ye beasts of the plain, for the plains of the wilderness have budded, for the trees have borne their fruit, the fig tree and the vine have yielded their strength.
029	JOE	002	023	Rejoice then and be glad, ye children of Sion, in the Lord your God: for he has given you food fully, and he will rain on you the early and the latter rain, as before.
029	JOE	002	024	And the floors shall be filled with corn, and the presses shall overflow with wine and oil.
029	JOE	002	025	And I will recompense you for the years which the locust, and the caterpillar, and the palmerworm, and the cankerworm have eaten, [even] my great army, which I sent against you.
029	JOE	002	026	And ye shall eat abundantly, and be satisfied, and shall praise the name of the Lord your God [for the things] which he has wrought wonderfully with you: and my people shall not be ashamed for ever.
029	JOE	002	027	And ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and [that] I am the Lord your God, and [that] there is none else beside me; and my people shall no more be ashamed for ever.
029	JOE	002	028	And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your old men shall dream dreams, and your young men shall see visions.
029	JOE	002	029	And on my servants and on [my] handmaids in those days will I pour out of my Spirit.
029	JOE	002	030	And I will shew wonders in heaven, and upon the earth, blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke.
029	JOE	002	031	The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and glorious day of the Lord come.
029	JOE	002	032	And it shall come to pass [that] whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved: for in mount Sion and in Jerusalem shall the saved one be as the Lord has said, and they that have glad tidings preached to them, whom the Lord has called.
029	JOE	003	001	For, behold, in those days and at that time, when I shall have turned the captivity of Juda and Jerusalem,
029	JOE	003	002	I will also gather all the Gentiles, and bring them down to the valley of Josaphat, and will plead with them there for my people and my heritage Israel, who have been dispersed among the Gentiles; and [these Gentiles] have divided my land,
029	JOE	003	003	and cast lots over my people, and have given [their] boys to harlots, and sold [their] girls for wine, and have drunk.
029	JOE	003	004	And what have ye to do with me, O Tyre, and Sidon, and all Galilee of the Gentiles? do ye render me a recompense? or do ye bear malice against me? quickly and speedily will I return your recompense on your own heads:
029	JOE	003	005	because ye have taken my silver and my gold, and ye have brought my choice ornaments into your temples;
029	JOE	003	006	and ye have sold the children of Juda and the children of Jerusalem to the children of the Greeks, that ye might expel them from their coasts.
029	JOE	003	007	Therefore, behold, I [will] raise them up out of the place whither ye have sold them, and I will return your recompense on your own heads.
029	JOE	003	008	And I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hands of the children of Juda, and they shall sell them into captivity to a far distant nation: for the Lord has spoken [it].
029	JOE	003	009	Proclaim these things among the Gentiles; declare war, arouse the warriors, draw near and go up, all ye men of war.
029	JOE	003	010	Beat your ploughshares into swords, and your sickles into spears: let the weak say, I am strong.
029	JOE	003	011	Gather yourselves together, and go in, all ye nations round about, and gather yourselves there; let the timid become a warrior.
029	JOE	003	012	Let them be aroused, let all the nations go up to the valley of Josaphat: for there will I sit to judge all the Gentiles round about.
029	JOE	003	013	Bring forth the sickles, for the vintage is come: go in, tread [the grapes], for the press is full: cause the vats to overflow; for their wickedness is multiplied.
029	JOE	003	014	Noises have resounded in the valley of judgment: for the day of the Lord is near in the valley of judgment.
029	JOE	003	015	The sun and the moon shall be darkened, and the stars shall withdraw their light.
029	JOE	003	016	And the Lord shall cry out of Sion, and shall utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the heaven and the earth shall be shaken, but the Lord shall spare his people, and shall strengthen the children of Israel.
029	JOE	003	017	And ye shall know that I am the Lord your God, who dwell in Sion my holy mountain: and Jerusalem shall be holy, and strangers shall not pass through her anymore.
029	JOE	003	018	And it shall come to pass in that day [that] the mountains shall drop sweet wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the fountains of Juda shall flow with water, and a fountain shall go forth of the house of the Lord, and water the valley of flags.
029	JOE	003	019	Egypt shall be a desolation, and Idumea shall be a desolate plain, because of the wrongs of the children of Juda, because they have shed righteous blood in their land.
029	JOE	003	020	But Judea shall be inhabited for ever, and Jerusalem to all generations.
029	JOE	003	021	And I will make inquisition for their blood, and will by no means leave it unavenged: and the Lord shall dwell in Sion.

# BOOK	030	AMO	Amos	Amos
030	AMO	001	001	The words of Amos which came [to him] in Accarim out of Thecue, which he saw concerning Jerusalem, in the days of Ozias king of Juda, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joas king of Israel, two years before the earthquake.
030	AMO	001	002	And he said, The Lord has spoken out of Sion, and has uttered his voice out of Jerusalem; and the pastures of the shepherds have mourned, and the top of Carmel is dried up.
030	AMO	001	003	And the Lord said, For three sins of Damascus, and for four, I will not turn away from it; because they sawed with iron saws the women with child of the Galaadites.
030	AMO	001	004	And I will send a fire on the house of Azael, and it shall devour the foundations of the son of Ader.
030	AMO	001	005	And I will break to pieces the bars of Damascus, and will destroy the inhabitants out of the plain of On, and will cut in pieces a tribe out of the men of Charrhan: and the famous people of Syria shall be led captive, saith the Lord.
030	AMO	001	006	Thus saith the Lord; For three sins of Gaza, and for four, I will not turn away from them; because they took prisoners the captivity of Solomon, to shut [them] up into Idumea.
030	AMO	001	007	And I will send forth a fire on the walls of Gaza, and it shall devour its foundations.
030	AMO	001	008	And I will destroy the inhabitants out of Azotus, and a tribe shall be cut off from Ascalon, and I will stretch out my hand upon Accaron: and the remnant of the Philistines shall perish, saith the Lord.
030	AMO	001	009	Thus saith the Lord; For three transgressions of Tyre, and for four, I will not turn away from it; because they shut up the prisoners of Solomon into Idumea, and remembered not the covenant of brethren.
030	AMO	001	010	And I will send forth a fire on the walls of Tyre, and it shall devour the foundations of it.
030	AMO	001	011	Thus saith the Lord; For three sins of Idumea, and for four, I will not turn away from them; because they pursued their brother with the sword, and destroyed the mother upon the earth, and summoned up his anger for a testimony, and kept up his fury to the end.
030	AMO	001	012	And I will send forth a fire upon Thaman, and it shall devour the foundations of her walls.
030	AMO	001	013	Thus saith the Lord; For three sins of the children of Ammon, and for four, I will not turn away from him; because they ripped up the women with child of the Galaadites, that they might widen their coasts.
030	AMO	001	014	And I will kindle a fire on the walls of Rabbath, and it shall devour her foundations with shouting in the day of war, and she shall be shaken in the days of her destruction:
030	AMO	001	015	and her kings shall go into captivity, their priests and their rulers together, saith the Lord.
030	AMO	002	001	Thus saith the Lord; For three sins of Moab, and for four, I will not turn away from it; because they burnt the bones of the king of Idumea to lime.
030	AMO	002	002	But I will send forth a fire on Moab, and it shall devour the foundations of its cities: and Moab shall perish in weakness, with a shout, and with the sound of a trumpet.
030	AMO	002	003	And I will destroy the judge out of her, and slay all her princes with him, saith the Lord.
030	AMO	002	004	Thus saith the Lord; For three sins of the children of Judah, and for four, I will not turn away from him; because they have rejected the law of the Lord, and have not kept his ordinances, and their vain [idols] which they made, which their fathers followed, caused them to err.
030	AMO	002	005	And I will send a fire on Juda, and it shall devour the foundations of Jerusalem.
030	AMO	002	006	Thus saith the Lord; for three sins of Israel, and for four, I will not turn away from him; because they sold the righteous for silver, and the poor for sandals,
030	AMO	002	007	wherewith to tread on the dust of the earth, and they have smitten upon the heads of the poor, and have perverted the way of the lowly: and a son and his father have gone into the same maid, that they might profane the name of their God.
030	AMO	002	008	And binding their clothes with cords they have made them curtains near the altar, and they have drunk wine gained by extortion in the house of their God.
030	AMO	002	009	Nevertheless I cut off the Amorite from before them, whose height was as the height of a cedar, and he was strong as an oak; and I dried up his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath.
030	AMO	002	010	And I brought you up out of the land of Egypt, and led you about in the desert forty years, that ye should inherit the land of the Amorites.
030	AMO	002	011	And I took of your sons for prophets, and of your young men for consecration. Are not these things so, ye sons of Israel? saith the Lord.
030	AMO	002	012	But ye gave the consecrated ones wine to drink; and ye commanded the prophets, saying, Prophesy not.
030	AMO	002	013	Therefore, behold, I roll under you, as a waggon full of straw is rolled.
030	AMO	002	014	And flight shall perish from the runner, and the strong shall not hold fast his strength, and the warrior shall not save his life:
030	AMO	002	015	and the archer shall not withstand, and he that is swift of foot shall in no wise escape; and the horseman shall not save his life.
030	AMO	002	016	And the strong shall find no confidence in power: the naked shall flee away in that day, saith the Lord.
030	AMO	003	001	Hear ye this word, O house of Israel, which the Lord has spoken concerning you, and against the whole family whom I brought up out of the land of Egypt, saying,
030	AMO	003	002	You especially have I known out of all the families of the earth: therefore will I take vengeance upon you for all your sins.
030	AMO	003	003	Shall two walk together at all, if they do not know one another?
030	AMO	003	004	Will a lion roar out of his thicket if he has no prey? will a [lion's] whelp utter his voice at all out of his lair, if he have taken nothing?
030	AMO	003	005	Will a bird fall on the earth without a fowler? will a snare be taken up from the earth without having taken anything?
030	AMO	003	006	Shall the trumpet sound in the city, and the people not be alarmed? shall there be evil in a city which the Lord has not wrought?
030	AMO	003	007	For the Lord God will do nothing, without revealing instruction to his servants the prophets.
030	AMO	003	008	A lion shall roar, and who will not be alarmed? the Lord God has spoken, and who will not prophesy?
030	AMO	003	009	Proclaim it to the regions among the Assyrians, and to the regions of Egypt, and say, Gather yourselves to the mountain of Samaria, and behold many wonderful things in the midst of it, and the oppression that is in it.
030	AMO	003	010	And she knew not what things would come against her, saith the Lord, [even] those that store up wrong and misery in their countries.
030	AMO	003	011	Therefore thus saith the Lord God; O Tyre, thy land shall be made desolate round about [thee]; and he shall bring down thy strength out of thee, and thy countries shall be spoiled.
030	AMO	003	012	Thus saith the Lord; As when a shepherd rescues from the mouth of a lion two legs or a piece of an ear, so shall be drawn forth the children of Israel who dwell in Samaria in the presence of [a foreign] tribe, and in Damascus.
030	AMO	003	013	Hear, O ye priests, and testify to the house of Jacob, saith the Lord God Almighty.
030	AMO	003	014	For in the day wherein I shall take vengeance of the sins of Israel upon him, I will also take vengeance on the altars of Bethel: and the horns of the altar shall be broken down, and they shall fall upon the ground.
030	AMO	003	015	I will crush and smite the turreted-house upon the summer-house; and the ivory-houses shall be destroyed, and many other houses also, saith the Lord.
030	AMO	004	001	Hear ye this word, ye heifers of the land of Basan that are in the mountain of Samaria, that oppress the poor, and trample on the needy, which say to their masters, Give us that we may drink.
030	AMO	004	002	The Lord swears by his holiness, that, behold, the days come upon you, when they shall take you with weapons, and fiery destroyers shall cast those with you into boiling caldrons.
030	AMO	004	003	And ye shall be brought forth naked in the presence of each other; and ye shall be cast forth on the mountain Romman, saith the Lord.
030	AMO	004	004	Ye went into Bethel, and sinned, and ye multiplied sin at Galgala; and ye brought your meat-offerings in the morning, [and] your tithes every third day.
030	AMO	004	005	And they read the law without, and called for public professions: proclaim aloud that the children of Israel have loved these things, saith the Lord.
030	AMO	004	006	And I will give you dullness of teeth in all your cities, and want of bread in all your places: yet ye returned not to me, saith the Lord.
030	AMO	004	007	Also I withheld from you the rain three months before the harvest: and I will rain upon one city, and on another city I will not rain: one part shall be rained upon, and the part on which I shall not rain shall be dried up.
030	AMO	004	008	And [the inhabitants of] two or three cities shall be gathered to one city to drink water, and they shall not be satisfied: yet ye have not returned to me, saith the Lord.
030	AMO	004	009	I smote you with parching, and with blight: ye multiplied your gardens, your vineyards, and your fig-grounds, and the cankerworm devoured your olive-yards: yet not [even] thus did ye return to me, saith the Lord.
030	AMO	004	010	I sent pestilence among you by the way of Egypt, and slew your young men with the sword, together with thy horses that were taken captive; and in my wrath against you I set fire to your camps: yet not even thus did ye return to me, saith the Lord.
030	AMO	004	011	I overthrew you, as God overthrew Sodoma and Gomorrha, and ye became as a brand plucked out of the fire: yet not even thus did ye return to me, saith the Lord.
030	AMO	004	012	Therefore thus will I do to thee, O Israel: nay because I will do thus to thee, prepare to call on thy God, O Israel.
030	AMO	004	013	For, behold, I am he that strengthens the thunder, and creates the wind, and proclaims to men his Christ, forming the morning and the darkness, and mounting on the high places of the earth, The Lord God Almighty is his name.
030	AMO	005	001	Hear ye this word of the Lord, even a lamentation, which I take up against you. The house of Israel is fallen; it shall no more rise.
030	AMO	005	002	The virgin of Israel has fallen upon his land; there is none that shall raise her up.
030	AMO	005	003	Therefore thus saith the Lord God; The city out of which there went forth a thousand, [in it] there shall be left a hundred, and [in that] out of which there went forth a hundred, there shall be left ten to the house of Israel.
030	AMO	005	004	Wherefore thus saith the Lord to the house of Israel, Seek ye me, and ye shall live.
030	AMO	005	005	But seek not Bethel, and go not into Galgala, and cross not over to the Well of the Oath: for Galgala shall surely go into captivity, and Bethel shall be as that which is not.
030	AMO	005	006	Seek ye the Lord, and ye shall live; lest the house of Joseph blaze as fire, and it devour him, and there shall be none to quench it for the house of Israel.
030	AMO	005	007	[It is he] that executes judgment in the height [above], and he has established justice on the earth:
030	AMO	005	008	who makes all things, and changes [them], and turns darkness into the morning, and darkens the day into night: who calls for the water of the sea, and pours it out on the face of the earth: the Lord is his name:
030	AMO	005	009	who dispenses ruin to strength, and brings distress upon the fortress.
030	AMO	005	010	They hated him that reproved in the gates, and abhorred holy speech.
030	AMO	005	011	Therefore because they have smitten the poor with their fists, and ye have received of them choice gifts; ye have built polished houses, but ye shall not dwell in them; ye have planted desirable vineyards, but ye shall not drink the wine of them.
030	AMO	005	012	For I know your many transgressions, and your sins are great, trampling on the just, taking bribes, and turning aside [the judgment of] the poor in the gates.
030	AMO	005	013	Therefore the prudent shall be silent at that time; for it is a time of evils.
030	AMO	005	014	Seek good, and not evil, that ye may live: and so the Lord God Almighty shall be with you, as ye have said,
030	AMO	005	015	We have hated evil, and loved good: and restore ye judgment in the gates; that the Lord God Almighty may have mercy on the remnant of Joseph.
030	AMO	005	016	Therefore thus saith the Lord God Almighty; In all the streets [shall be] lamentations; and in all the ways shall it be said, Woe, woe! the husbandman shall be called to mourning and lamentation, and to them that are skilled in complaining.
030	AMO	005	017	And [there shall be] lamentation in all the ways; because I will pass through the midst of thee, saith the Lord.
030	AMO	005	018	Woe to you that desire the day of the Lord! what is this day of the Lord to you? whereas it is darkness, and not light.
030	AMO	005	019	As if a man should flee from the face of a lion, and a bear should meet him; and he should spring into his house, and lean his hands upon the wall, and a serpent should bite him.
030	AMO	005	020	Is not the day of the Lord darkness, and not light? and is not this [day] gloom without brightness?
030	AMO	005	021	I hate, I reject your feasts, and I will not smell [your] meat-offerings in your general assemblies.
030	AMO	005	022	Wherefore if ye should bring me your whole-burnt-sacrifices and meat-offerings, I will not accept [them]: neither will I have respect to your grand peace-offerings.
030	AMO	005	023	Remove from me the sound of thy songs, and I will not hear the music of thine instruments.
030	AMO	005	024	But let judgment roll down as water, and righteousness as an impassable torrent.
030	AMO	005	025	Have ye offered to me victims and sacrifices, O house of Israel, forty years in the wilderness?
030	AMO	005	026	Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Raephan, the images of them which ye made for yourselves.
030	AMO	005	027	And I will carry you away beyond Damascus, saith the Lord, the Almighty God is his name.
030	AMO	006	001	Woe to them that set at nought Sion, and that trust in the mountain of Samaria: they have gathered [the harvest of] the heads of the nations, and they have gone in themselves.
030	AMO	006	002	O house of Israel, pass by all [of you], and see; and pass by thence to Ematrabba; and thence descend to Geth of the Philistines, the chief of all these kingdoms, [see] if their coasts are greater than your coasts.
030	AMO	006	003	Ye who are approaching the evil day, who are drawing near and adopting false sabbaths;
030	AMO	006	004	who sleep upon beds of ivory, and live delicately on their couches, and eat kids out of the flocks, and sucking calves out of the midst of the stalls;
030	AMO	006	005	who excel in the sound of musical instruments; they have regarded them as abiding, not as fleeting [pleasures];
030	AMO	006	006	who drink strained wine, and anoint themselves with the best ointment; and have suffered nothing on occasion of the calamity of Joseph.
030	AMO	006	007	Therefore now shall they depart into captivity from the dominion of princes, and the neighing of horses shall be cut off from Ephraim.
030	AMO	006	008	For the Lord has sworn by himself, [saying], Because I abhor all the pride of Jacob, I do also hate his countries, and I will cut off [his] city with all who inhabit it.
030	AMO	006	009	And it shall come to pass, if there be ten men left in one house, that they shall die.
030	AMO	006	010	But a remnant shall be left behind, and their relations shall take them, and shall strenuously endeavor to carry forth their bones from the house: and one shall say to the heads of the house, Is there yet [any one] else with thee? And he shall say, No [one] else. And [the other] shall say, Be silent, that thou name not the name of the Lord.
030	AMO	006	011	For, behold, the Lord commands, and he will smite the great house with breaches, and the little house with rents.
030	AMO	006	012	Will horses run upon rocks? will they refrain from neighing at mares? for ye have turned judgment into poison, and the fruit of righteousness into bitterness:
030	AMO	006	013	ye who rejoice at vanity, who say, Have we not possessed horns by our own strength?
030	AMO	006	014	For behold, O house of Israel, I will raise up against you a nation, saith the Lord of hosts; and they shall afflict you so that ye shall not enter into Aemath, and as it were [from] the river of the wilderness.
030	AMO	007	001	Thus has the Lord God shewed me; and, behold, a swarm of locusts coming from the east; and, behold, one caterpillar, king Gog.
030	AMO	007	002	And it came to pass when he had finished devouring the grass of the land, that I said, Lord God, be merciful; who shall raise up Jacob? for he is small in number.
030	AMO	007	003	Repent, O Lord, for this. And this shall not be, saith the Lord.
030	AMO	007	004	Thus has the Lord shewed me; and, behold, the Lord called for judgment by fire, and it devoured the great deep, and devoured the Lord's portion.
030	AMO	007	005	Then I said, O Lord, cease, I pray thee: who shall raise up Jacob? for he is small in number. Repent, O Lord, for this.
030	AMO	007	006	This also shall not be, saith the Lord.
030	AMO	007	007	Thus the Lord shewed me; and behold, he stood upon a wall of adamant, and in his hand [was] an adamant.
030	AMO	007	008	And the Lord said to me, What seest thou, Amos? And I said, An adamant. And the Lord said to me, Behold, I appoint an adamant in the midst of my people Israel: I will not pass by them any more.
030	AMO	007	009	And the joyful altars shall be abolished, and the sacrifices of Israel shall be set aside; and I will rise up against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.
030	AMO	007	010	Then Amasias the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos is forming conspiracies against thee in the midst of the house of Israel: the land will be utterly unable to bear all his words.
030	AMO	007	011	For thus says Amos, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall be led away captive from his land.
030	AMO	007	012	And Amasias said to Amos, Go, seer, remove thou into the land of Juda, and live there, and thou shalt prophesy there:
030	AMO	007	013	but thou shalt no longer prophesy at Bethel: for it is the king's sanctuary, and it is the royal house.
030	AMO	007	014	And Amos answered, and said to Amasias, I was not a prophet, nor the son of a prophet; but I was a herdman, and a gatherer of sycamore fruits.
030	AMO	007	015	And the Lord took me from the sheep, and the Lord said to me, Go, and prophesy to my people Israel.
030	AMO	007	016	And now hear the word of the Lord: Thou sayest, Prophesy not to Israel, and raise not a tumult against the house of Jacob.
030	AMO	007	017	Therefore thus saith the Lord; Thy wife shall be a harlot in the city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy land shall be measured with the line; and thou shalt die in an unclean land; and Israel shall be led captive out of his land. Thus has the Lord God shewed me.
030	AMO	008	001	And behold a fowler's basket.
030	AMO	008	002	And he said, What seest thou, Amos? And I said, A fowler's basket. And the Lord said to me, The end is come upon my people Israel; I will not pass by them any more.
030	AMO	008	003	And the ceilings of the temple shall howl in that day, saith the Lord God: [there shall be] many a fallen one in every place; I will bring silence upon [them].
030	AMO	008	004	Hear now this, ye that oppress the poor in the morning, and drive the needy ones by tyranny from the earth,
030	AMO	008	005	saying, When will the month pass away, and we shall sell, and the sabbath, and we shall open the treasure, to make the measure small, and to enlarge the weight, and make the balance unfair?
030	AMO	008	006	That we may buy the poor for silver, and the needy for shoes; and we will trade in every kind of fruit.
030	AMO	008	007	The Lord swears against the pride of Jacob, None of your works shall ever be forgotten.
030	AMO	008	008	And shall not the land be troubled for these things, and shall not every one who dwells in it mourn? whereas destruction shall come up as a river, and shall descend as the river of Egypt.
030	AMO	008	009	And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord God, [that] the sun shall go down at noon, and the light shall be darkened on the earth by day:
030	AMO	008	010	and I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation; and I will bring up sackcloth on all loins, and baldness on every head; and I will make them as the mourning of a beloved [friend], and those with them as a day of grief.
030	AMO	008	011	Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will send forth a famine on the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but a famine of hearing the word of the Lord.
030	AMO	008	012	And the waters shall be troubled from sea to sea, and from the north to the east shall [men] run hither and thither, seeking the word of the Lord, and they shall not find [it].
030	AMO	008	013	In that day shall the fair virgins and the young men faint for thirst;
030	AMO	008	014	they who swear by the propitiation of Samaria, and who say, Thy god, O Dan, lives; and, Thy god, O Bersabee, lives; and they shall fall, and shall no more rise again.
030	AMO	009	001	I saw the Lord standing on the altar: and he said, Smite the mercy-seat, and the porch shall be shaken: and cut through into the heads of all; and I will slay the remnant of them with the sword: no one of them fleeing shall escape, and no one of them, striving to save himself shall be delivered.
030	AMO	009	002	Though they hid themselves in hell, thence shall my hand drag them forth; and though they go up to heaven, thence will I bring them down.
030	AMO	009	003	If they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, thence will I search [them] out and take them; and if they should go down from my presence into the depths of the sea, there will I command the serpent, and he shall bite them.
030	AMO	009	004	And if they should go into captivity before the face of their enemies, there will I command the sword, and it shall slay them: and I will set mine eyes against them for evil, and not for good.
030	AMO	009	005	And the Lord, the Lord God Almighty, [is he] that takes hold of the land, and causes it to shake, and all that inhabit it shall mourn; and its destruction shall go up as a river, and shall descend as the river of Egypt.
030	AMO	009	006	[It is he] that builds his ascent up to the sky, and establishes his promise on the earth; who calls the water of the sea, and pours it out on the face of the earth; the Lord Almighty is his name.
030	AMO	009	007	Are not ye to me as the sons of the Ethiopians, O children of Israel? saith the Lord. Did I not bring Israel up out of the land of Egypt, and the Philistines from Cappadocia, and the Syrians out of the deep?
030	AMO	009	008	Behold, the eyes of the Lord God are upon the kingdom of sinners, and I will cut it off from the face of the earth; only I will not utterly cut off the house of Jacob, saith the Lord.
030	AMO	009	009	For I [will] give commandment, and sift the house of Israel among all the Gentiles, as [corn] is sifted in a sieve, and [yet] a fragment shall not in any wise fall upon the earth.
030	AMO	009	010	All the sinners of my people shall die by the sword, who say, Calamities shall certainly not draw near, nor come upon us.
030	AMO	009	011	In that day I will raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen, and will rebuild the ruins of it, and will set up the parts thereof that have been broken down, and will build it up as in the ancient days:
030	AMO	009	012	that the remnant of men, and all the Gentiles upon whom my name is called, may earnestly seek [me], saith the Lord who does all these things.
030	AMO	009	013	Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when the harvest shall overtake the vintage, and the grapes shall ripen at seedtime; and the mountains shall drop sweet wine, and all the hills shall be planted.
030	AMO	009	014	And I will turn the captivity of my people Israel, and they shall rebuild the ruined cities, and shall inhabit [them]; and they shall plant vineyards, and shall drink the wine from them; and they shall form gardens, and eat the fruit of them.
030	AMO	009	015	And I will plant them on their land, and they shall no more be plucked up from the land which I have given them, saith the Lord God Almighty.

# BOOK	031	OBA	Obadiah	Obdias
031	OBA	001	001	The vision of Obdias. Thus saith the Lord God to Idumea; I have heard a report from the Lord, and he has sent forth a message to the nations.
031	OBA	001	002	Arise ye, and let us rise up against her to war.
031	OBA	001	003	Behold, I have made thee small among the Gentiles: thou art greatly dishonoured. The pride of thine heart has elated thee, dwelling [as thou dost] in the holes of the rocks, [as one that] exalts his habitation, saying in his heart, Who will bring me down to the ground?
031	OBA	001	004	If thou shouldest mount up as the eagle, and if thou shouldest make thy nest among the stars, thence will I bring thee down, saith the Lord.
031	OBA	001	005	If thieves came in to thee, or robbers by night, where wouldest thou have been cast away? would they not have stolen [just] enough for themselves? and if grape-gatherers went in to thee, would they not leave a gleaning?
031	OBA	001	006	How has Esau been searched out, and [how] have his hidden things been detected?
031	OBA	001	007	They sent thee to thy coasts: all the men of thy covenant have withstood thee; thine allies have prevailed against thee, they have set snares under thee: they have no understanding.
031	OBA	001	008	In that day, saith the Lord, I will destroy the wise men out of Idumea, and understanding out of the mount of Esau.
031	OBA	001	009	And thy warriors from Thaeman shall be dismayed, to the end that man may be cut off from the mount of Esau.
031	OBA	001	010	Because of the slaughter and the sin [committed against] thy brother Jacob, shame shall cover thee, and thou shalt be cut off for ever.
031	OBA	001	011	From the day that thou stoodest in opposition [to him], in the days when foreigners were taking captive his forces, and strangers entered into his gates, and cast lots on Jerusalem, thou also wast as one of them.
031	OBA	001	012	And thou shouldest not have looked on the day of thy brother in the day of strangers; nor shouldest thou have rejoiced against the children of Juda in the day of their destruction; neither shouldest thou have boasted in the day of [their] affliction.
031	OBA	001	013	Neither shouldest thou have gone into the gates of the people in the day of their troubles; nor yet shouldest thou have looked upon their gathering in the day of their destruction, nor shouldest thou have attacked their host in the day of their perishing.
031	OBA	001	014	Neither shouldest thou have stood at the opening of their passages, to destroy utterly those of them that were escaping; neither shouldest thou have shut up his fugitives in the day of affliction.
031	OBA	001	015	For the day of the Lord is near upon all the Gentiles: as thou have done, so shall it be [done] to thee: thy recompense shall be returned on thine [own] head.
031	OBA	001	016	For as thou hast drunk upon my holy mountain, [so] shall all the nations drink wine; they shall drink, and go down, and be as if they were not.
031	OBA	001	017	But on mount Sion there shall be deliverance, and there shall be a sanctuary; and the house of Jacob shall take for an inheritance those that took them for an inheritance.
031	OBA	001	018	And the house of Jacob shall be fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau [shall be] for stubble; and [Israel] shall flame forth against them, and shall devour them, and there shall not be a corn-field [left] to the house of Esau; because the Lord has spoken.
031	OBA	001	019	And they [that dwell] in the south shall inherit the mount of Esau, and they in the plain the Philistines: and they shall inherit the mount of Ephraim, and the plain of Samaria, and Benjamin, and the land of Galaad.
031	OBA	001	020	And this [shall be] the domain of the captivity of the children of Israel, the land of the Chananites as far as Sarepta; and the captives of Jerusalem [shall inherit] as far as Ephratha; they shall inherit the cities of the south.
031	OBA	001	021	And they that escape shall come up from mount Sion, to take vengeance on the mount of Esau; and the kingdom shall be the Lord's.

# BOOK	032	JON	Jonah	Jonas
032	JON	001	001	Now the word of the Lord came to Jonas the son of Amathi, saying,
032	JON	001	002	Rise, and go to Nineve, the great city, and preach in it; for the cry of its wickedness is come up to me.
032	JON	001	003	But Jonas rose up to flee to Tharsis from the presence of the Lord. And he went down to Joppa, and found a ship going to Tharsis: and he paid his fare, and went up into it, to sail with them to Tharsis from the presence of the Lord.
032	JON	001	004	And the Lord raised up a wind on the sea; and there was a great storm on the sea, and the ship was in danger of being broken.
032	JON	001	005	And the sailors were alarmed, and cried every one to his god, and cast out the wares that were in the ship into the sea, that it might be lightened of them. But Jonas was gone down into the hold of the ship, and was asleep, and snored.
032	JON	001	006	And the shipmaster came to him, and said to him, Why snorest thou? arise, and call upon thy God, that God may save us, and we perish not.
032	JON	001	007	And each man said to his neighbour, Come, let us cast lots, and find out for whose sake this mischief is upon us. So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonas.
032	JON	001	008	And they said to him, Tell us what is thine occupation, and whence comest thou, and of what country and what people art thou?
032	JON	001	009	And he said to them, I am a servant of the Lord; and I worship the Lord God of heaven, who made the sea, and the dry [land].
032	JON	001	010	Then the men feared exceedingly, and said to him, What is this [that] thou hast done? for the men knew that he was fleeing from the face of the Lord, because he had told them.
032	JON	001	011	And they said to him, What shall we do to thee, that the sea may be calm to us? for the sea rose, and lifted its wave exceedingly.
032	JON	001	012	And Jonas said to them, Take me up, and cast me into the sea, and the sea shall be calm to you: for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you.
032	JON	001	013	And the men tried hard to return to the land, and were not able: for the sea rose and grew more and more tempestuous against them.
032	JON	001	014	And they cried to the Lord, and said, Forbid it, Lord: let us not perish for the sake of this man's life, and bring not righteous blood upon us: for thou, Lord, hast done as thou wouldest.
032	JON	001	015	So they took Jonas, and cast him out into the sea: and the sea ceased from its raging.
032	JON	001	016	And the men feared the Lord very greatly, and offered a sacrifice to the Lord, and vowed vows.
032	JON	001	017	Now the Lord had commanded a great whale to swallow up Jonas: and Jonas was in the belly of the whale three days and three nights.
032	JON	002	001	And Jonas prayed to the Lord his God out of the belly of the whale,
032	JON	002	002	and said, I cried in my affliction to the Lord my God, and he hearkened to me, [even] to my cry out of the belly of hell: thou heardest my voice.
032	JON	002	003	Thou didst cast me into the depths of the heart of the sea, and the floods compassed me: all thy billows and thy waves have passed upon me.
032	JON	002	004	And I said, I am cast out of thy presence: shall I indeed look again toward thy holy temple?
032	JON	002	005	Water was poured around me to the soul: the lowest deep compassed me, my head went down
032	JON	002	006	to the clefts of the mountains; I went down into the earth, whose bars are the everlasting barriers: yet, O Lord my God, let my ruined life be restored.
032	JON	002	007	When my soul was failing me, I remembered the Lord; and may my prayer come to thee into thy holy temple.
032	JON	002	008	They that observe vanities and lies have forsaken their own mercy.
032	JON	002	009	But I will sacrifice to thee with the voice of praise and thanksgiving: all that I have vowed I will pay to thee, the Lord of [my] salvation.
032	JON	002	010	And the whale was commanded by the Lord, and it cast up Jonas on the dry [land].
032	JON	003	001	And the word of the Lord came to Jonas the second time, saying,
032	JON	003	002	Rise, go to Nineve, the great city, and preach in it according to the former preaching which I spoke to thee of.
032	JON	003	003	And Jonas arose, and went to Nineve, as the Lord had spoken. Now Nineve was an exceeding great city, of about three days' journey.
032	JON	003	004	And Jonas began to enter into the city about a day's journey, and he proclaimed, and said, Yet three days, and Nineve shall be overthrown.
032	JON	003	005	And the men of Nineve believed God, and proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloths, from the greatest of them to the least of them.
032	JON	003	006	And the word reached the king of Nineve, and he arose from off his throne, and took off his raiment from him, and put on sackcloth, and sat on ashes.
032	JON	003	007	And proclamation was made, and it was commanded in Nineve by the king an by his great men, saying, Let not men, or cattle, or oxen, or sheep, taste [any thing], nor feed, nor drink water.
032	JON	003	008	So men and cattle were clothed with sackcloths, and cried earnestly to God; and they turned every one from their evil way, and from the iniquity that was in their hands, saying,
032	JON	003	009	Who knows if God will repent, and turn from his fierce anger, and [so] we shall not perish?
032	JON	003	010	And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil ways; and God repented of the evil which he had said he would do to them; and he did [it] not.
032	JON	004	001	But Jonas was very deeply grieved, and he was confounded.
032	JON	004	002	And he prayed to the Lord, and said, O Lord, were not these my words when I was yet in my land? therefore I made haste to flee to Tharsis; because I knew that thou are merciful and compassionate, long-suffering, and abundant in kindness, and repentest of evil.
032	JON	004	003	And now, Lord God, take my life from me; for [it is] better for me to die than to live.
032	JON	004	004	And the Lord said to Jonas, Art thou very much grieved?
032	JON	004	005	And Jonas went out from the city, and sat over against the city; and he made for himself there a booth, and he sat under it, until he should perceive what would become of the city.
032	JON	004	006	And the Lord God commanded a gourd, and it came up over the head of Jonas, to be a shadow over his head, to shade him from his calamities: and Jonas rejoiced with great joy for the gourd.
032	JON	004	007	And God commanded a worm the next morning, and it smote the gourd, and it withered away.
032	JON	004	008	And it came to pass at the rising of the sun, that God commanded a burning east wind; and the sun smote on the head of Jonas, and he fainted, and despaired of his life, and said, [It is] better for me to die than to live.
032	JON	004	009	And God said to Jonas, Art thou very much grieved for the gourd? And he said, I am very much grieved, even to death.
032	JON	004	010	And the Lord said, Thou hadst pity on the gourd, for which thou has not suffered, neither didst thou rear it; which came up before night, and perished before [another] night:
032	JON	004	011	and shall not I spare Nineve, the great city, in which dwell more than twelve myriads of human beings, who do not know their right hand or their left hand; and [also] much cattle?

# BOOK	033	MIC	Micah	Michaeas
033	MIC	001	001	And the word of the Lord came to Michaeas the son of Morasthi, in the days of Joatham, and Achaz, and Ezekias, kings of Juda, concerning what he saw regarding Samaria and Jerusalem.
033	MIC	001	002	Hear [these] words, ye people; and let the earth give heed, and all that are in it: and the Lord God shall be among you for a testimony, the Lord out of his holy habitation.
033	MIC	001	003	For, behold, the Lord comes forth out of his place, and will come down, and will go upon the high places of the earth.
033	MIC	001	004	And the mountains shall be shaken under him, and the valleys shall melt like wax before the fire, and as water rushing down a declivity.
033	MIC	001	005	All these [calamities are] for the transgression of Jacob, and for the sin of the house of Israel. What is the transgression of Jacob? [is it] not Samaria? and what is the sin of the house of Juda? [is it] not Jerusalem?
033	MIC	001	006	Therefore I will make Samaria [as] a store-house of the fruits of the field, and [as] a planting of a vineyard: and I will utterly demolish her stones, and I will expose her foundations.
033	MIC	001	007	And they shall cut in pieces all the graven images, and all that she has hired they shall burn with fire, and I will utterly destroy all her idols: because she has gathered of the hires of fornication, and of the hires of fornication has she amassed [wealth].
033	MIC	001	008	Therefore shall she lament and wail, she shall go barefooted, and [being] naked she shall make lamentation as [that] of serpents, and mourning as of the daughters of sirens.
033	MIC	001	009	For her plague has become grievous; for it has come even to Juda; and has reached to the gate of my people, even to Jerusalem.
033	MIC	001	010	Ye that are in Geth, exalt not yourselves, and ye Enakim, do not rebuild from [the ruins of] the house in derision: sprinkle dust [in the place of] your laughter.
033	MIC	001	011	The inhabitant of Sennaar, fairly inhabiting her cities, came not forth to mourn for the house next to her: she shall receive of you the stroke of grief.
033	MIC	001	012	Who has begun [to act] for good to her that dwells in sorrow? for calamities have come down from the Lord upon the gates of Jerusalem,
033	MIC	001	013	[even] a sound of chariots and horsemen: the inhabitants of Lachis, she is the leader of sin to the daughter of Sion: for in thee were found the transgressions of Israel.
033	MIC	001	014	Therefore shall he cause men to be sent forth as far as the inheritance of Geth, [even] vain houses; they are become vanity to the kings of Israel;
033	MIC	001	015	until they bring the heirs, O inhabitant of Lachis: the inheritance shall reach to Odollam, [even] the glory of the daughter of Israel.
033	MIC	001	016	Shave thine hair, and make thyself bald for thy delicate children; increase thy widowhood as an eagle; for [thy people] are gone into captivity from thee.
033	MIC	002	001	They meditated troubles, and wrought wickedness on their beds, and they put it in execution with the daylight; for they have not lifted up their hands to God.
033	MIC	002	002	And they desired fields, and plundered orphans, and oppressed families, and spoiled a man and his house, even a man and his inheritance.
033	MIC	002	003	Therefore thus saith the Lord; Behold, I devise evils against this family, out of which ye shall not lift up your necks, neither shall ye walk upright speedily: for the time is evil.
033	MIC	002	004	In that day shall a parable be taken up against you, and a plaintive lamentation shall be uttered, saying, We are thoroughly miserable: the portion of my people has been measured out with a line, and there was none to hinder him so as to turn him back; your fields have been divided.
033	MIC	002	005	Therefore thou shalt have no one to cast a line for the lot.
033	MIC	002	006	Weep not with tears in the assembly of the Lord, neither let [any] weep for these things; for he shall not remove the reproaches,
033	MIC	002	007	who says, The house of Jacob has provoked the Spirit of the Lord; are not these his practices? Are not the Lord's words right with him? and have they not proceeded correctly?
033	MIC	002	008	Even beforetime my people withstood [him] as an enemy against his peace; they have stripped off his skin to remove hope [in] the conflict of war.
033	MIC	002	009	The leaders of my people shall be cast forth from their luxurious houses; they are rejected because of their evil practices; draw ye near to the everlasting mountains.
033	MIC	002	010	Arise thou, and depart; for this is not thy rest because of uncleanness: ye have been utterly destroyed;
033	MIC	002	011	ye have fled, no one pursuing [you: thy] spirit has framed falsehood, it has dropped on thee for wine and strong drink. But it shall come to pass, [that] out of the dropping of this people,
033	MIC	002	012	Jacob shall be completely gathered with all [his people:] I will surely receive the remnant of Israel; I will cause them to return together, as sheep in trouble, as a flock in the midst of their fold: they shall rush forth from among men through the breach made before them:
033	MIC	002	013	they have broken through, and passed the gate, and gone out by it: and their king has gone out before them, and the Lord shall lead them.
033	MIC	003	001	And he shall say, Hear now these words, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and ye remnant of the house of Israel; is it not for you to know judgment?
033	MIC	003	002	[who] hate good, and seek evil; [who] tear their skins off them, and their flesh off their bones:
033	MIC	003	003	even as they devoured the flesh of my people, and stripped their skins off them, and broke their bones, and divided [them] as flesh for the caldron, and as meat for the pot,
033	MIC	003	004	thus they shall cry to the Lord, but he shall not hearken to them; and he shall turn away his face from them at that time, because they have done wickedly in their practices against themselves.
033	MIC	003	005	Thus saith the Lord concerning the prophets that lead my people astray, that bit with their teeth, and proclaim peace to them; and [when] nothing was put into their mouth, they raised up war against them:
033	MIC	003	006	therefore there shall be night to you instead of a vision, and there shall be to you darkness instead of prophecy; and the sun shall go down upon the prophets, and the day shall be dark upon them.
033	MIC	003	007	And the seers of night-visions shall be ashamed, and the prophets shall be laughed to scorn: and all the people shall speak against them, because there shall be none to hearken to them.
033	MIC	003	008	Surely I will strengthen myself with the Spirit of the Lord, and of judgment, and of power, to declare to Jacob his transgressions, and to Israel his sins.
033	MIC	003	009	Hear now these words, ye chiefs of the house of Jacob, and the remnant of the house of Israel, who hate judgment, and pervert all righteousness;
033	MIC	003	010	who build up Sion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity.
033	MIC	003	011	The heads thereof have judged for gifts, and the priests thereof have answered for hire, and her prophets have divined for silver: and [yet] they have rested on the Lord, saying, Is not the Lord among us? no evil shall come upon us.
033	MIC	003	012	Therefore on your account Sion shall be ploughed as a field, and Jerusalem shall be as a storehouse of fruits, and the mountain of the house as a grove of the forest.
033	MIC	004	001	And at the last days the mountain of the Lord shall be manifest, established on the tops of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and the peoples shall hasten to it.
033	MIC	004	002	And many nations shall go, and say, Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and they shall shew us his way, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Sion shall go forth a law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.
033	MIC	004	003	And he shall judge among many peoples, and shall rebuke strong nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into sickles; and nation shall no more lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn to war any more.
033	MIC	004	004	And every one shall rest under his vine, and every one under his fig-tree; and there shall be none to alarm [them]: for the mouth of the Lord Almighty has spoken these [words].
033	MIC	004	005	For all [other] nations shall walk everyone in his own way, but we will walk in the name of the Lord our God for ever and ever.
033	MIC	004	006	In that day, saith the Lord, I will gather her that is bruised, and will receive her that is cast out, and those whom I rejected.
033	MIC	004	007	And I will make her that was bruised a remnant, and her that was rejected a mighty nation: and the Lord shall reign over them in mount Sion from henceforth, even for ever.
033	MIC	004	008	And thou, dark tower of the flock, daughter of Sion, on thee the dominion shall come and enter in, [even] the first kingdom from Babylon to the daughter of Jerusalem.
033	MIC	004	009	And now, why hast thou known calamities? was there not a king to thee? or has thy counsel perished that pangs as of a woman in travail have seized upon thee?
033	MIC	004	010	Be in pain, and strengthen thyself, and draw near, O daughter of Sion, as a woman in travail: for now thou shalt go forth out of the city, and shalt lodge in the plain, and shalt reach even to Babylon: thence shall the Lord thy God deliver thee, and thence shall he redeem thee out of the hand of thine enemies.
033	MIC	004	011	And now have many nations gathered against thee, saying, We will rejoice, and our eyes shall look upon Sion.
033	MIC	004	012	But they know not the thought of the Lord, and have not understood his counsel: for he has gathered them as sheaves of the floor.
033	MIC	004	013	Arise, and thresh them, O daughter of Sion: for I will make thine horns iron, and I will make thine hoofs brass: and thou shalt utterly destroy many nations, and shalt consecrate their abundance to the Lord, and their strength to the Lord of all the earth.
033	MIC	005	001	Now shall the daughter [of Sion] be completely hedged in: he has laid siege against us: they shall smite the tribes of Israel with a rod upon the cheek.
033	MIC	005	002	And thou, Bethleem, house of Ephratha, art few in number to be [reckoned] among the thousands of Juda; [yet] out of thee shall one come forth to me, to be a ruler of Israel; and his goings forth were from the beginning, [even] from eternity.
033	MIC	005	003	Therefore shall he appoint them [to wait] till the time of her that travails: she shall bring forth, and [then] the remnant of their brethren shall return to the children of Israel.
033	MIC	005	004	And the Lord shall stand, and see, and feed his flock with power, and they shall dwell in the glory of the name of the Lord their God: for now shall they be magnified to the ends of the earth.
033	MIC	005	005	And she shall have peace when Assur shall come into your land, and when he shall come up upon your country; and there shall be raised up against him seven shepherds, and eight attacks of men.
033	MIC	005	006	And they shall tend the Assyrian with a sword, and the land of Nebrod with her trench: and he shall deliver [you] from the Assyrian, when he shall come upon your land, and when he shall invade your coasts.
033	MIC	005	007	And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the Gentiles in the midst of many peoples, as dew falling from the Lord, and as lambs on the grass; that none may assemble nor resist among the sons of men.
033	MIC	005	008	And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the Gentiles in the midst of many nations, as a lion in the forest among cattle, and as a [lion's] whelp among the flocks of sheep, even as when he goes through, and selects, and carries off [his prey], and there is none to deliver.
033	MIC	005	009	Thine hand shall be lifted up against them that afflict thee, and all thine enemies shall be utterly destroyed.
033	MIC	005	010	And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord, [that] I will utterly destroy the horses out of the midst of thee, and destroy thy chariots;
033	MIC	005	011	and I will utterly destroy the cities of thy land, and demolish all thy strong-holds:
033	MIC	005	012	and I will utterly destroy thy sorceries out of thine hands; and there shall be no soothsayers in thee.
033	MIC	005	013	And I will utterly destroy thy graven images, and thy statues out of the midst of thee; and thou shalt never any more worship the works of thine hands.
033	MIC	005	014	And I will cut off the groves out of the midst of thee, and I will abolish thy cities.
033	MIC	005	015	and I will execute vengeance on the heathen in anger and wrath, because they hearkened not.
033	MIC	006	001	Hear now a word: the Lord God has said; Arise, plead with the mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice.
033	MIC	006	002	Hear ye, O mountains, the controversy of the Lord, and [ye] valleys [even] the foundations of the earth: for the Lord [has] a controversy with his people, and will plead with Israel.
033	MIC	006	003	O my people, what have I done to thee? or wherein have I grieved thee? or wherein have I troubled thee? answer me.
033	MIC	006	004	For I brought tee up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out of the house of bondage, and sent before thee Moses, and Aaron, and Mariam.
033	MIC	006	005	O my people, remember now, what counsel Balac king of Moab took against thee, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him, from the reeds to Galgal; that the righteousness of the Lord might be known.
033	MIC	006	006	Wherewithal shall I reach the Lord, [and] lay hold of my God most high? shall I reach him by whole-burnt-offerings, by calves of a year old?
033	MIC	006	007	Will the Lord accept thousands of rams, or ten thousands of fat goats? should I give my first-born for ungodliness, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?
033	MIC	006	008	Has it [not] been told thee, O man, what [is] good? or what does the Lord require of thee, but to do justice, and love mercy, and be ready to walk with the Lord thy God?
033	MIC	006	009	The Lord's voice shall be proclaimed in the city, and he shall save those that fear his name: hear, O tribe; and who shall order the city?
033	MIC	006	010	[Is there] not fire, and the house of the wicked heaping up wicked treasures, and [that] with the pride of unrighteousness?
033	MIC	006	011	Shall the wicked be justified by the balanced, or deceitful weights in the bag,
033	MIC	006	012	whereby they have accumulated their ungodly wealth, and they that dwell in the city have uttered falsehoods, and their tongue has been exalted in their mouth?
033	MIC	006	013	Therefore will I begin to smite thee; I will destroy thee in thy sins.
033	MIC	006	014	Thou shalt eat, and shalt not be satisfied; and there shall be darkness upon thee; and he shall depart from [thee], and thou shalt not escape; and all that shall escape shall be delivered over to the sword.
033	MIC	006	015	Thou shalt sow, but thou shalt not reap; thou shalt press the olive, but thou shalt not anoint thyself with oil; and [shalt make] wine, but ye shall drink no wine: and the ordinances of my people shall be utterly abolished.
033	MIC	006	016	For thou hast kept the statues of Zambri, and [done] all the works of the house of Achaab; and ye have walked in their ways, that I might deliver thee to utter destruction, and those that inhabit the city to hissing: and ye shall bear the reproach of nations.
033	MIC	007	001	Alas for me! for I am become as one gathering straw in harvest, and as [one gathering] grape-gleanings in the vintage, when there is no cluster for me to eat the first-ripe fruit: alas my soul!
033	MIC	007	002	For the godly is perished from the earth; and there is none among men that orders [his way] aright: they all quarrel even to blood: they grievously afflict every one his neighbour:
033	MIC	007	003	they prepare their hands for mischief, the prince asks [a reward], and the judge speaks flattering words; it is the desire of their soul:
033	MIC	007	004	therefore I will take away their goods as a devouring moth, and as one who acts by a [rigid] rule in a day of visitation. Woe, woe, thy times of vengeance are come; now shall be their lamentations.
033	MIC	007	005	Trust not in friends, and confide not in guides: beware of thy wife, so as not to commit anything to her.
033	MIC	007	006	For the son dishonours his father, the daughter will rise up against her mother, the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law: those in his house [shall be] all a man's enemies.
033	MIC	007	007	But I will look to the Lord; I will wait upon God my Saviour: my God will hearken to me.
033	MIC	007	008	Rejoice not against me, mine enemy; for I have fallen [yet] shall arise; for though I should sit in darkness, the Lord shall be a light to me.
033	MIC	007	009	I will bear the indignation of the Lord, because I have sinned against him, until he make good my cause: he also shall maintain my right, and shall bring me out to the light, [and] I shall behold his righteousness.
033	MIC	007	010	And she that is mine enemy shall see it, and shall clothe herself with shame, who says, Where [is] the Lord thy God? mine eyes shall look upon her: now shall she be for trampling as mire in the ways.
033	MIC	007	011	[It is] the day of making of brick; that day shall be thine utter destruction, and that day shall utterly abolish thine ordinances.
033	MIC	007	012	And thy cities shall be levelled, and parted among the Assyrians; and thy strong cities shall be parted from Tyre to the river, and from sea to sea, and from mountain to mountain.
033	MIC	007	013	And the land shall be utterly desolate together with them that inhabit it, because of the fruit of their doings.
033	MIC	007	014	Tend thy people with thy rod, the sheep of thine inheritance, those that inhabit by themselves the thicket in the midst of Carmel: they shall feed in the land of Basan, and in the land of Galaad, as in the days of old.
033	MIC	007	015	And according to the days of thy departure out of Egypt shall ye see marvellous [things].
033	MIC	007	016	The nations shall see and be ashamed; and at all their might they shall lay their hands upon their mouth, their ears shall be deafened.
033	MIC	007	017	They shall lick the dust as serpents crawling on the earth, they shall be confounded in their holes; they shall be amazed at the Lord our God, and will be afraid of thee.
033	MIC	007	018	Who is a God like thee, cancelling iniquities, and passing over the sins of the remnant of his inheritance? and he has not kept his anger for a testimony, for he delights in mercy.
033	MIC	007	019	He will return and have mercy upon us; he will sink our iniquities, and they shall be cast into the depth of the sea, [even] all our sins.
033	MIC	007	020	He shall give blessings truly to Jacob, and mercy to Abraam, as thou swarest to our fathers, according to the former days.

# BOOK	034	NAH	Nahum	Naum
034	NAH	001	001	The burden of Nineve: the book of the vision of Naum the Elkesite.
034	NAH	001	002	God is jealous, and the Lord avenges; the Lord avenges with wrath; the Lord takes vengeance on his adversaries, and he cuts off his enemies.
034	NAH	001	003	The Lord is long-suffering, and his power is great, and the Lord will not hold any guiltless: his way is in destruction and in the whirlwind, and the clouds are the dust of his feet.
034	NAH	001	004	He threatens the sea, and dries it up, and exhausts all the rivers: the land of Basan, and Carmel are brought low, and the flourishing [trees] of Libanus have come to nought.
034	NAH	001	005	The mountains quake at him, and the hills are shaken, and the earth recoils at his presence, [even] the world, and all that dwell in it.
034	NAH	001	006	Who shall stand before his anger? and who shall withstand in the anger of his wrath? his wrath brings to nought kingdoms, and the rocks are burst asunder by him.
034	NAH	001	007	The Lord is good to them that wait on him in the day of affliction; and he knows them that reverence him.
034	NAH	001	008	But with an overrunning flood he will make an utter end: darkness shall pursue those that rise up against [him] and his enemies.
034	NAH	001	009	What do ye devise against the Lord? he will make a complete end: he will not take vengeance by affliction twice at the same time.
034	NAH	001	010	For [the enemy] shall be laid bare even to the foundation, and shall be devoured as twisted yew, and as stubble fully dry.
034	NAH	001	011	Out of thee shall proceed a device against the Lord, counselling evil things hostile [to him].
034	NAH	001	012	Thus saith the Lord who rules over many waters, Even thus shall they be sent away, and the report of thee shall not be heard any more.
034	NAH	001	013	And now will I break his rod from off thee, and will burst [thy] bonds.
034	NAH	001	014	And the Lord shall give a command concerning thee; there shall no more of thy name be scattered: I will utterly destroy the graven [images] out of the house of thy god, and the molten [images]: I will make thy grave; for [they are] swift.
034	NAH	001	015	Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that brings glad tidings, and publishes peace! O Juda, keep thy feasts, pay thy vows: for they shall no more pass through thee to [thy] decay.
034	NAH	002	001	It is all over with him, he has been removed, [one] who has been delivered from affliction has come up panting into thy presence, watch the way, strengthen [thy] loins, be very valiant in [thy] strength.
034	NAH	002	002	For the Lord has turned aside the pride of Jacob, as the pride of Israel: for they have utterly rejected them, and have destroyed their branches.
034	NAH	002	003	[They have destroyed] the arms of their power from among men, their mighty men sporting with fire: the reins of their chariots [shall be destroyed] in the day of his preparation, and the horsemen shall be thrown into confusion
034	NAH	002	004	in the ways, and the chariots shall clash together, and shall be entangled in each other in the broad ways: their appearance is as lamps of fire, and as gleaming lightnings.
034	NAH	002	005	And their mighty men shall bethink themselves and flee by day; and they shall be weak as they go; and they shall hasten to her walls, and shall prepare their defences.
034	NAH	002	006	The gates of the cities have been opened, and the palaces have fallen into ruin,
034	NAH	002	007	and the foundation has been exposed; and she has gone up, and her maid-servants were led [away] as doves moaning in their hearts.
034	NAH	002	008	And [as for] Nineve, her waters [shall be] as a pool of water: and they fled, and staid not, and there was none to look back.
034	NAH	002	009	They plundered the silver, they plundered the gold, and there was no end of their adorning; they were loaded [with it] upon all their pleasant vessels.
034	NAH	002	010	[There is] thrusting forth, and shaking, and tumult, and heart-breaking, and loosing of knees, and pangs on all loins; and the faces of all [are] as the blackening of a pot.
034	NAH	002	011	Where is the dwelling-place of the lions, and the pasture that belonged to the whelps? where did the lion go, that the lion's whelp should enter in there, and there was none to scare [him] away?
034	NAH	002	012	The lion seized enough prey for his whelps, and strangled for his [young] lions, and filled his lair with prey, and his dwelling-place with spoil.
034	NAH	002	013	Behold, I am against thee, saith the Lord Almighty, and I will burn up thy multitude in the smoke, and the sword shall devour thy lions; and I will utterly destroy thy prey from off the land, and thy deeds shall no more at all be heard of.
034	NAH	003	001	O city of blood, wholly false, full of unrighteousness; the prey shall not be handled.
034	NAH	003	002	The noise of whips, and the noise of the rumbling of wheels, and of the pursuing horse, and of the bounding chariot,
034	NAH	003	003	and of the mounting rider, and of the glittering sword, and of the gleaming arms, and of a multitude of slain, and of heavy falling: and there was no end to her nations, but they shall be weak in their bodies
034	NAH	003	004	because of the abundance of fornication: [she is] a fair harlot, and well-favoured, skilled in sorcery, that sells the nations by her fornication, and peoples by her sorceries.
034	NAH	003	005	Behold, I am against thee, saith the Lord God Almighty, and I will uncover thy skirts in thy presence, and I will shew the nations thy shame, and the kingdoms thy disgrace.
034	NAH	003	006	And I will cast abominable filth upon thee according to thine unclean ways, and will make thee a public example.
034	NAH	003	007	And it shall be [that] every one that sees thee shall go down from thee, and shall say, Wretched Nineve! who shall lament for her? whence shall I seek comfort for her?
034	NAH	003	008	Prepare thee a portion, tune the chord, prepare a portion for Ammon: she that dwells among the rivers, water is round about her, whose dominion is the sea, and whose walls are water.
034	NAH	003	009	And Ethiopia is her strength, and Egypt; and there was no limit of the flight [of her enemies]; and the Libyans became her helpers.
034	NAH	003	010	Yet she shall go as a prisoner into captivity, and they shall dash her infants against the ground at the top of all her ways: and they shall cast lots upon all her glorious [possessions], and all her nobles shall be bound in chains.
034	NAH	003	011	And thou shalt be drunken, and shalt be overlooked; and thou shalt seek for thyself strength because of [thine] enemies.
034	NAH	003	012	All thy strong-holds are as fig-trees having watchers: if they be shaken, they shall fall into the mouth of the eater.
034	NAH	003	013	Behold, thy people within thee are as women: the gates of thy land shall surely be opened to thine enemies: the fire shall devour thy bars.
034	NAH	003	014	Draw thee water for a siege, and well secure thy strong-holds: enter into the clay, and be thou trodden in the chaff, make [the fortifications] stronger than brick.
034	NAH	003	015	There the fire shall devour thee; the sword shall utterly destroy thee, it shall devour thee as the locust, and thou shalt be pressed down as a palmerworm.
034	NAH	003	016	Thou hast multiplied thy merchandise beyond the stars of heaven: the palmerworm has attacked [it], and has flown away.
034	NAH	003	017	Thy mixed [multitude] has suddenly departed as the grasshopper, as the locust perched on a hedge in a frosty day; the sun arises, and it flies off, and knows not its place: woe to them!
034	NAH	003	018	Thy shepherds have slumbered, the Assyrian king has laid low thy mighty men: thy people departed to the mountains, and there was none to receive [them].
034	NAH	003	019	There is no healing for thy bruise; thy wound has rankled: all that hear the report of thee shall clap their hands against thee; for upon whom has not thy wickedness passed continually?

# BOOK	035	HAB	Habakkuk	Ambacum
035	HAB	001	001	The burden which the prophet Ambacum saw.
035	HAB	001	002	How long, O Lord, shall I cry out, and thou wilt not hearken? [how long] shall I cry out to thee being injured, and thou wilt not save?
035	HAB	001	003	Wherefore hast thou shown me troubles and griefs to look upon, misery and ungodliness? judgment is before me, and the judge receives a reward.
035	HAB	001	004	Therefore the law is frustrated, and judgment proceeds not effectually, for the ungodly [man] prevails over the just; therefore perverse judgment will proceed.
035	HAB	001	005	Behold, ye despisers, and look, and wonder marvelously, and vanish: for I work a work in your days, which ye will in no wise believe, though a man declare [it to you].
035	HAB	001	006	Wherefore, behold, I stir up the Chaldeans, the bitter and hasty nation, that walks upon the breadth of the earth, to inherit tabernacles not his own.
035	HAB	001	007	He is terrible and famous; his judgment shall proceed of himself, and his dignity shall come out of himself.
035	HAB	001	008	And his horses shall bound [more swiftly] than leopards, and [they are] fiercer than the wolves of Arabia: and his horsemen shall ride forth, and shall rush from far; and they shall fly as an eagle hasting to eat.
035	HAB	001	009	Destruction shall come upon ungodly men, resisting with their adverse front, and he shall gather the captivity as the sand.
035	HAB	001	010	And he shall be at his ease with kings, and princes are his toys, and he shall mock at every strong-hold, and shall cast a mound, and take possession of it.
035	HAB	001	011	Then shall he change his spirit, and he shall pass through, and make an atonement, [saying], This strength [belongs] to my god.
035	HAB	001	012	[Art] not thou from the beginning, O Lord God, my Holy One? and surely we shall not die. O Lord, thou hast established it for judgment, and he has formed me to chasten [with] his correction.
035	HAB	001	013	[His] eye is too pure to behold evil [doings], and to look upon grievous afflictions: wherefore dost thou look upon despisers? wilt thou be silent when the ungodly swallows up the just?
035	HAB	001	014	And wilt thou make men as the fishes of the sea, and as the reptiles which have no guide?
035	HAB	001	015	He has brought up destruction with a hook, and drawn one with a casting net, and caught another in his drags: therefore shall his heart rejoice and be glad.
035	HAB	001	016	Therefore will he sacrifice to his drag, and burn incense to his casting-net, because by them he has made his portion fat, and his meats choice.
035	HAB	001	017	Therefore will he cast his net, and will not spare to slay the nations continually.
035	HAB	002	001	I will stand upon my watch, and mount upon the rock, and watch to see what he will say by me, and what I shall answer when I am reproved.
035	HAB	002	002	And the Lord answered me and said, Write the vision, and [that] plainly on a tablet, that he that reads it may run.
035	HAB	002	003	For the vision [is] yet for a time, and it shall shoot forth at the end, and not in vain: though he should tarry, wait for him; for he will surely come, and will not tarry.
035	HAB	002	004	If he should draw back, my soul has no pleasure in him: but the just shall live by my faith.
035	HAB	002	005	But the arrogant man and the scorner, the boastful man, shall not finish anything; who has enlarged his desire as the grave, and like death he is never satisfied, and he will gather to himself all the nations, and will receive to himself all the peoples.
035	HAB	002	006	Shall not all these take up a parable against him? and a proverb to tell against him? and they shall say, Woe to him that multiplies to himself the possessions which are not his! how long? and who heavily loads his yoke.
035	HAB	002	007	For suddenly there shall arise up those that bite him, and they that plot against thee shall awake, and thou shalt be a plunder to them.
035	HAB	002	008	Because thou hast spoiled many nations, all the nations that are left shall spoil [thee], because of the blood of men, and the sins of the land and city, and of all that dwell in it.
035	HAB	002	009	Woe to him that covets an evil covetousness to his house, that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the power of evils.
035	HAB	002	010	Thou hast devised shame to thy house, thou hast utterly destroyed many nations, and thy soul has sinned.
035	HAB	002	011	For the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beetle out of the timber shall speak.
035	HAB	002	012	Woe to him that builds a city with blood, and establishes a city by unrighteousness.
035	HAB	002	013	Are not these things of the Lord Almighty? surely many people have been exhausted in the fire, and many nations have fainted.
035	HAB	002	014	For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord; it shall cover them as water.
035	HAB	002	015	Woe to him that gives his neighbour to drink the thick lees [of wine], and intoxicates [him], that he may look upon their secret parts.
035	HAB	002	016	Drink thou also [thy] fill of disgrace instead of glory: shake, O heart, and quake, the cup of the right hand of the Lord has come round upon thee, and dishonour has gathered upon thy glory.
035	HAB	002	017	For the ungodliness of Libanus shall cover thee, and distress because of wild beasts shall dismay thee, because of the blood of men, and the sins of the land and city, and of all that dwell in it.
035	HAB	002	018	What profit it the graven image, that they have graven it? [one] has made it a molten work, a false image; for the maker has trusted in his work, to make dumb idols.
035	HAB	002	019	Woe to him that says to the wood, Awake, arise; and to the stone, Be thou exalted! whereas it is an image, and this is a casting of gold and silver, and there is no breath in it.
035	HAB	002	020	But the Lord is in his holy temple: let all the earth fear before him.
035	HAB	003	001	A PRAYER OF THE PROPHET AMBACUM, WITH A SONG.
035	HAB	003	002	O Lord, I have heard thy report, and was afraid: I considered thy works, and was amazed: thou shalt be known between the two living creatures, thou shalt be acknowledged when the years draw nigh; thou shalt be manifested when the time is come; when my soul is troubled, thou wilt in wrath remember mercy.
035	HAB	003	003	God shall come from Thaeman, and the Holy One from the dark shady mount Pharan. (Pause)
035	HAB	003	004	His excellence covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise. And his brightness shall be as light; [there were] horns in his hands, and he caused a mighty love of his strength.
035	HAB	003	005	Before his face shall go a report, and it shall go forth into the plains,
035	HAB	003	006	the earth stood at his feet and trembled: he beheld, and the nations melted away: the mountains were violently burst through, the everlasting hills melted at his everlasting going forth.
035	HAB	003	007	Because of troubles I looked upon the tents of the Ethiopians: the tabernacles also of the land of Madiam shall be dismayed.
035	HAB	003	008	Wast thou angry, O Lord, with the rivers? or [was] thy wrath against the rivers, or thine anger against the sea? for thou wilt mount on thine horses, and thy chariots are salvation.
035	HAB	003	009	Surely thou didst bend they bow at scepters, saith the Lord. (Pause) The land of rivers shall be torn asunder.
035	HAB	003	010	The nations shall see thee and be in pain, [as thou dost] divide the moving waters: the deep uttered her voice, and raised her form on high.
035	HAB	003	011	The sun was exalted, and the moon stood still in her course: thy darts shall go forth at the light, at the brightness of the gleaming of thine arms.
035	HAB	003	012	Thou wilt bring low the land with threatening, and in wrath thou wilt break down the nations.
035	HAB	003	013	Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, to save thine anointed: thou shalt bring death on the heads of transgressors; thou has brought bands upon [their] neck. (Pause)
035	HAB	003	014	Thou didst cut asunder the heads of princes with amazement, they shall tremble in it; they shall burst their bridles, [they shall be] as a poor man devouring in secret.
035	HAB	003	015	And thou dost cause thine horses to enter the sea, disturbing much water.
035	HAB	003	016	I watched, and my belly trembled at the sound of the prayer of my lips, and trembling entered into my bones, and my frame was troubled within me; I will rest in the day of affliction, from going up to the people of my sojourning.
035	HAB	003	017	For [though] the fig-tree shall bear no fruit, and there shall be no produce on the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall produce no food: the sheep have failed from the pasture, and there are no oxen at the cribs;
035	HAB	003	018	yet I will exult in the Lord, I will joy in God my Saviour.
035	HAB	003	019	The Lord God is my strength, and he will perfectly strengthen my feet; he mounts me upon high places, that I may conquer by his song.

# BOOK	036	ZEP	Zephaniah	Sophonias
036	ZEP	001	001	The word of the Lord which came to Sophonias the son of Chusi, the son of Godolias, the son of Amorias, the son of Ezekias, in the days of Josias son of Amon, king of Juda.
036	ZEP	001	002	Let there be an utter cutting off from the face of the land, saith the Lord.
036	ZEP	001	003	Let man and cattle be cut off; let the birds of the air and the fishes of the sea be cut off; and the ungodly shall fail, and I will take away the transgressors from the face of the land, saith the Lord.
036	ZEP	001	004	And I will stretch out mine hand upon Juda, and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and I will remove the names of Baal out of this place, and the names of the priests;
036	ZEP	001	005	and them that worship the host of heaven upon the house-tops; and them that worship and swear by the Lord, and them that swear by their king;
036	ZEP	001	006	and them that turn aside from the Lord, and them that seek not the Lord, and them that cleave not to the Lord.
036	ZEP	001	007	Fear ye before the Lord God; for the day of the Lord is near; for the Lord has prepared his sacrifice, and has sanctified his guests.
036	ZEP	001	008	And it shall come to pass in the day of the Lord's sacrifice, that I will take vengeance on the princes, and on the king's house, and upon all that wear strange apparel.
036	ZEP	001	009	And I will openly take vengeance on the porches in that day, [on the men] that fill the house of the Lord their God with ungodliness and deceit.
036	ZEP	001	010	And there shall be in that day, saith the Lord, the sound of a cry from the gate of men slaying, and a howling from the second [gate], and a great crashing from the hills.
036	ZEP	001	011	Lament, ye that inhabit the [city] that has been broken down, for all the people has become like Chanaan; and all that were exalted by silver have been utterly destroyed.
036	ZEP	001	012	And it shall come to pass in that day, [that] I will search Jerusalem with a candle, and will take vengeance on the men that despise the things committed to them; but they say in their hearts, The Lord will not do any good, neither will he do any evil.
036	ZEP	001	013	And their power shall be for a spoil, and their houses for utter desolation; and they shall build houses, but shall not dwell in them; and they shall plant vineyards, but shall not drink the wine of them.
036	ZEP	001	014	For the great day of the Lord [is] near, [it is] near, and very speedy; the sound of the day of the Lord is made bitter and harsh.
036	ZEP	001	015	A mighty day of wrath is that day, a day of affliction and distress, a day of desolation and destruction, a day of gloominess and darkness, a day of cloud and vapour,
036	ZEP	001	016	a day of the trumpet and cry against the strong cities, and against the high towers.
036	ZEP	001	017	And I will greatly afflict the men, and they shall walk as blind men, because they have sinned against the Lord; therefore he shall pour out their blood as dust, and their flesh as dung.
036	ZEP	001	018	And their silver and their gold shall in nowise be able to rescue them in the day of the Lord's wrath; but the whole land shall be devoured by the fire of his jealously; for he will bring a speedy destruction on all them that inhabit the land.
036	ZEP	002	001	Be ye gathered and closely joined together, O unchastened nation;
036	ZEP	002	002	before ye become as the flower that passes away, before the anger of the Lord come upon you, before the day of the wrath of the Lord come upon you.
036	ZEP	002	003	Seek ye the Lord, all ye meek of the earth; do judgment, and seek justice, and answer accordingly; that ye may be hid in the day of the wrath of the Lord.
036	ZEP	002	004	For Gaza shall be utterly spoiled, and Ascalon shall be destroyed; and Azotus shall be cast forth at noon-day, and Accaron shall be rooted up.
036	ZEP	002	005	Woe to them that dwell on the border of the sea, neighbours of the Cretans! the word of the Lord is against you, O Chanaan, land of the Philistines, and I will destroy you out of [your] dwelling-place.
036	ZEP	002	006	And Crete shall be a pasture of flocks, and a fold of sheep.
036	ZEP	002	007	And the sea cost shall be for the remnant of the house of Juda; they shall pasture upon them in the houses of Ascalon; they shall rest in the evening because of the children of Juda; for the Lord their God has visited them, and he will turn away their captivity.
036	ZEP	002	008	I have heard the revilings of Moab, and the insults of the children of Ammon, wherewith they have reviled my people, and magnified themselves against my coasts.
036	ZEP	002	009	Therefore, [as] I live, saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, Moab shall be as Sodoma, and the children of Ammon as Gomorrha; and Damascus [shall be] left as a heap of the threshing-floor, and desolate for ever: and the remnant of my people shall plunder them, and the remnant of my nations shall inherit them.
036	ZEP	002	010	This is their punishment in return for their haughtiness, because they have reproached and magnified themselves against the Lord Almighty.
036	ZEP	002	011	The Lord shall appear against them, and shall utterly destroy all the gods of the nations of the earth; and they shall worship him every one from his place, [even] all the islands of the nations.
036	ZEP	002	012	Ye Ethiopians also are the slain of my sword.
036	ZEP	002	013	And he shall stretch forth his hand against the north and destroy the Assyrian, and make Nineve a dry wilderness, [even] as a desert.
036	ZEP	002	014	And flocks, and all the wild beasts of the land, and chameleons shall feed in the midst thereof: and hedgehogs shall lodge in the ceilings thereof; and wild beasts shall cry in the breaches thereof, and ravens in her porches, whereas her loftiness was [as] as cedar.
036	ZEP	003	001	This is the scornful city that dwells securely, that says in her heart, I am, and there is no longer any [to be] after me: how is she become desolate, a habitation of wild beasts! every one that passes through her shall hiss, and shake his hands. Alas the glorious and ransomed city.
036	ZEP	003	002	The dove hearkened not to the voice; she received not correction; she trusted not in the Lord, and she drew not near to her God.
036	ZEP	003	003	Her princes within her were as roaring lions, her judges as the wolves of Arabia; they remained not till the morrow.
036	ZEP	003	004	Her prophets are light [and] scornful men: her priests profane the holy things, and sinfully transgress the law.
036	ZEP	003	005	But the just Lord is in the midst of her, and he will never do an unjust thing: morning by morning he will bring out his judgment to the light, and it is not hidden, and he knows not injustice by extortion, nor injustice in strife.
036	ZEP	003	006	I have brought down the proud with destruction; their corners are destroyed: I will make their ways completely waste, so that none shall go through: their cities are come to an end, by reason of no man living or dwelling [in them].
036	ZEP	003	007	I said, But do ye fear me, and receive instruction, and ye shall not be cut off from the face of the land [for] all the vengeance I have brought upon her: prepare thou, rise early: all their produce is spoilt.
036	ZEP	003	008	Therefore wait upon me, saith the Lord, until the day when I rise up for a witness: because my judgment [shall be] on the gatherings of the nations, to draw to me kings, to pour out upon them all [my] fierce anger: for the whole earth shall be consumed with the fire of my jealousy.
036	ZEP	003	009	For then will I turn to the peoples a tongue for her generation, that all may call on the name of the Lord, to serve him under one yoke.
036	ZEP	003	010	From the boundaries of the rivers of Ethiopia will I receive my dispersed ones; they shall offer sacrifices to me.
036	ZEP	003	011	In that day thou shalt not be ashamed of all thy practices, wherein thou hast transgressed against me: for then will I take away from thee thy disdainful pride, and thou shalt no more magnify thyself upon my holy mountain.
036	ZEP	003	012	And I will leave in thee a meek and lowly people;
036	ZEP	003	013	and the remnant of Israel shall fear the name of the Lord, and shall do no iniquity, neither shall they speak vanity; neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth: for they shall feed, and lie down, and there shall be none to terrify them.
036	ZEP	003	014	Rejoice, O daughter of Sion; cry aloud, O daughter of Jerusalem; rejoice and delight thyself with all thine heart, O daughter of Jerusalem.
036	ZEP	003	015	The Lord has taken away thine iniquities, he has ransomed thee from the hand of thine enemies: the Lord, the King of Israel, is in the midst of thee: thou shalt not see evil any more.
036	ZEP	003	016	At that time the Lord shall say to Jerusalem, Be of good courage, Sion; let not thine hands be slack.
036	ZEP	003	017	The Lord thy God is in thee; the Mighty One shall save thee: he shall bring joy upon thee, and shall refresh thee with his love; and he shall rejoice over thee with delight as in a day of feasting.
036	ZEP	003	018	And I will gather thine afflicted ones. Alas! who has taken up a reproach against her?
036	ZEP	003	019	Behold, I [will] work in thee for thy sake at that time, saith the Lord: and I will save her that was oppressed, and receive her that was rejected; and I will make them a praise, and honoured in all the earth.
036	ZEP	003	020	And [their enemies] shall be ashamed at that time, when I shall deal well with you, and at the time when I shall receive you: for I will make you honoured and a praise among all the nations of the earth, when I turn back your captivity before you, saith the Lord.

# BOOK	037	HAG	Haggai	Aggaeus
037	HAG	001	001	In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, on the first [day] of the month, the word of the Lord came by the hand of the prophet Aggaeus, saying, Speak to Zorobabel the son of Salathiel, of the tribe of Juda, and to Jesus the son of Josedec, the high priest, saying,
037	HAG	001	002	Thus saith the Lord Almighty, saying, This people say, The time is not come to build the house of the Lord.
037	HAG	001	003	And the word of the Lord came by the hand of the prophet Aggaeus, saying,
037	HAG	001	004	Is it time for you to dwell in your ceiled houses, whereas our house is desolate?
037	HAG	001	005	And now thus saith the Lord Almighty; Consider your ways, I pray you.
037	HAG	001	006	Ye have sown much, but brought in little; ye have eaten, and are not satisfied; ye have drunk, and are not satisfied with drink, ye have clothed yourselves, and have not become warm thereby: and he that earns wages has gathered [them] into a bag full of holes.
037	HAG	001	007	Thus saith the Lord Almighty; Consider your ways.
037	HAG	001	008	Go up to the mountain, and cut timber; build the house, and I will take pleasure in it, and be glorified, saith the Lord.
037	HAG	001	009	Ye looked for much, and there came little; and it was brought into the house, and I blew it away. Therefore thus saith the Lord Almighty, Because my house is desolate, and ye run everyone into his own house;
037	HAG	001	010	therefore shall the sky withhold dew, and the earth shall keep back her produce.
037	HAG	001	011	And I will bring a sword upon the land, and upon the mountains, and upon the corn, and upon the wine, and upon the oil, and all that the earth produces, and upon the men, and upon the cattle, and upon all the labours of their hands.
037	HAG	001	012	And Zorobabel the son of Salathiel, of the tribe of Juda, and Jesus the son of Josedec, the high priest, and all the remnant of the people, hearkened to the voice of the Lord their God, and the words of the prophet Aggaeus, according as the Lord their God had sent him to them, and the people feared before the Lord.
037	HAG	001	013	And Aggaeus the Lord's messenger spoke among the messengers of the Lord to the people, [saying], I am with you, saith the Lord.
037	HAG	001	014	And the Lord stirred up the spirit of Zorobabel the son of Salathiel, of the tribe of Juda, and the spirit of Jesus the son of Josedec, the high priest, and the spirit of the remnant of all the people; and they went in, and wrought in the house of the Lord Almighty their God,
037	HAG	001	015	on the four and twentieth [day] of the sixth month, in the second year of Darius the king.
037	HAG	002	001	In the seventh month, on the twenty-first [day] of the month, the Lord spoke by Aggaeus the prophet, saying,
037	HAG	002	002	Speak now to Zorobabel the son of Salathiel, of the tribe of Juda, and to Jesus the son of Josedec, the high priest, and to all the remnant of the people, saying,
037	HAG	002	003	Who [is there] of you that saw this house in her former glory? and how do ye now look upon it, as it were nothing before your eyes?
037	HAG	002	004	Yet now be strong, O Zorobabel, saith the Lord; and strengthen thyself, O Jesus the high priest, the son of Josedec; and let all the people of the land strengthen themselves, saith the Lord, and work, for I am with you, saith the Lord Almighty;
037	HAG	002	005	and my Spirit remains in the midst of you; be of good courage.
037	HAG	002	006	For thus saith the Lord Almighty; Yet once I will shake the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry [land];
037	HAG	002	007	and I will shake all nations, and the choice [portions] of all the nations shall come: and I will fill this house with glory, saith the Lord Almighty.
037	HAG	002	008	Mine is the silver, and mine the gold, saith the Lord Almighty.
037	HAG	002	009	For the glory of this house shall be great, the latter more than the former, saith the Lord Almighty: and in this place will I give peace, saith the Lord Almighty, even peace of soul for a possession to every one that builds, to raise up this temple.
037	HAG	002	010	On the four and twentieth [day] of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of the Lord came to Aggaeus the prophet, saying,
037	HAG	002	011	Thus saith the Lord Almighty; Inquire now of the priest [concerning] the law, saying,
037	HAG	002	012	If a man should take holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and the skirt of his garment should touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any meat, shall it be holy? And the priests answered and said, No.
037	HAG	002	013	And Aggaeus said, If a defiled person who is unclean by reason of a dead body, touch any of these, shall it be defiled? And the priests answered and said, It shall be defiled.
037	HAG	002	014	And Aggaeus answered and said, So is this people, and so is this nation before me, saith the Lord; and so are all the works of their hands: and whosoever shall approach them, shall be defiled [because of their early burdens: they shall be pained because of their toils; and ye have hated him that reproved in the gates].
037	HAG	002	015	And now consider, I pray you, from this day and beforetime, before they laid a stone on a stone in the temple of the Lord, what manner of men ye were.
037	HAG	002	016	When ye cast into the corn-bin twenty measures of barley, and there were [only] ten measures of barley: and ye went to the vat to draw out fifty measures, and there were [but] twenty.
037	HAG	002	017	I smote you with barrenness, and with blasting, and all the works of your hands with hail; yet ye returned not to me, saith the Lord.
037	HAG	002	018	Set your hearts now [to think] from this day and upward, from the four and twentieth [day] of the ninth month, even from the day when the foundation of the temple of the Lord was laid;
037	HAG	002	019	consider in your hearts, whether [this] shall be known on the corn-floor, and whether yet the vine, and the fig-tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive-trees that bear no fruit [are with you]: from this day will I bless [you].
037	HAG	002	020	And the word of the Lord came the second time to Aggaeus the prophet, on the four and twentieth [day] of the month, saying,
037	HAG	002	021	Speak to Zorobabel the son of Salathiel, of the tribe of Juda, saying, I shake the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry [land];
037	HAG	002	022	and I will overthrow the thrones of kings, and I will destroy the power of the kings of the nations; and I will overthrow chariots and riders; and the horses and their riders shall come down, every one by the sword striving against his brother.
037	HAG	002	023	In that day, saith the Lord Almighty, I will take thee, O Zorobabel, the son of Salathiel, my servant, saith the Lord, and will make thee as a seal: for I have chosen thee, saith the Lord Almighty.

# BOOK	038	ZEC	Zechariah	Zacharias
038	ZEC	001	001	In the eighth month, in the second year of [the reign of] Darius, the word of the Lord came to Zacharias, the son of Barachias, the son of Addo, the prophet, saying,
038	ZEC	001	002	The Lord has been very angry with your fathers.
038	ZEC	001	003	And thou shalt say to them, Thus saith the Lord Almighty: Turn to me, saith the Lord of hosts, and I will turn to you, saith the Lord of hosts.
038	ZEC	001	004	And be ye not as your fathers, whom the prophets before charged, saying, Thus saith the Lord Almighty: Turn ye from your evil ways, and from your evil practices: but they hearkened not, and attended not to hearken to me, saith the Lord.
038	ZEC	001	005	Where are your fathers, and the prophets? Will they live for ever?
038	ZEC	001	006	But do ye receive my words and mine ordinances, all that I command by my Spirit to my servants the prophets, who lived in the days of your fathers; and they answered and said, As the Lord Almighty determined to do to us, according to our ways, and according to our practices, so has he done to us.
038	ZEC	001	007	On the twenty-fourth [day] in the eleventh month, this is the month Sabat, in the second year of [the reign of] Darius, the word of the Lord came to Zacharias, the son of Barachias, the son of Addo, the prophet, saying,
038	ZEC	001	008	I saw by night, and behold a man mounted on a red horse, and he stood between the shady mountains; and behind him were red horses, and grey, and piebald, and white.
038	ZEC	001	009	And I said, What are these, [my] lord? And the angel spoke with me said to me, I will shew thee what these [things] are.
038	ZEC	001	010	And the man that stood between the mountains answered, and said to me, These are [they] whom the Lord has sent forth to go round the earth.
038	ZEC	001	011	And they answered the angel of the Lord that stood between the mountains, and said, We have gone round all the earth, and, behold, all the earth is inhabited, and is at rest.
038	ZEC	001	012	Then the angel of the Lord answered and said, O Lord Almighty, how long wilt thou have no mercy on Jerusalem, and the cities of Juda, which thou has disregarded these seventy years?
038	ZEC	001	013	And the Lord Almighty answered the angel that spoke with me good words and consolatory sayings.
038	ZEC	001	014	And the angel that spoke with me said to me, Cry out and say, Thus saith the Lord Almighty; I have been jealous for Jerusalem and Sion with great jealousy.
038	ZEC	001	015	And I am very angry with the heathen that combine to attack [her]: forasmuch as I indeed was a little angry, but they combined to attack [her] for evil.
038	ZEC	001	016	Therefore thus saith the Lord: I will return to Jerusalem with compassion; and my house shall be rebuilt in her, saith the Lord Almighty, and a measuring line shall yet be stretched out over Jerusalem.
038	ZEC	001	017	And the angel that spoke with me said to me, Cry yet, and say, Thus saith the Lord Almighty; Yet shall cities be spread abroad through prosperity; and the Lord shall yet have mercy upon Sion, and shall choose Jerusalem.
038	ZEC	001	018	And I lifted up mine eyes and looked, and behold four horns.
038	ZEC	001	019	And I said to the angel that spoke with me, What are these things, [my] lord? And he said to me, These are the horns that have scattered Juda, and Israel, and Jerusalem.
038	ZEC	001	020	And the Lord shewed me four artificers.
038	ZEC	001	021	And I said, What are these coming to do? And he said, These are the horns that scattered Juda, and they broke Israel in pieces, and none of them lifted up his head: and these are come forth to sharpen them for their hands, [even] the four horns, the nations that lifted up the horn against the land of the Lord to scatter it.
038	ZEC	002	001	And I lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a man, and in his hand a measuring line.
038	ZEC	002	002	And I said to him, Whither goest thou? And he said to me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what is the breadth of it, and what is the length of it.
038	ZEC	002	003	And, behold, the angel that spoke with me stood [by], and another angel went forth to meet him,
038	ZEC	002	004	and spoke to him, saying, Run and speak to that young man, saying, Jerusalem shall be fully inhabited by reason of the abundance of men and cattle in the midst of her.
038	ZEC	002	005	And I will be to her, saith the Lord, a wall of fire round about, and I will be for a glory in the midst of her.
038	ZEC	002	006	Ho, ho, flee from the land of the north, saith the Lord: for I will gather you from the four winds of heaven, saith the Lord,
038	ZEC	002	007	[even] to Sion: deliver yourselves, ye that dwell [with] the daughter of Babylon.
038	ZEC	002	008	For thus saith the Lord Almighty; After the glory has he sent me to the nations that spoiled you: for he that touches you is as one that touches the apple of his eye.
038	ZEC	002	009	For, behold, I bring my hand upon them, and they shall be a spoil to them that serve them: and ye shall know that the Lord Almighty has sent me.
038	ZEC	002	010	Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Sion: for, behold, I come, and will dwell in the midst of thee, saith the Lord.
038	ZEC	002	011	And many nations shall flee for refuge to the Lord in that day, and they shall be for a people to him, and they shall dwell in the midst of thee: and thou shalt know that the Lord Almighty has sent me to thee.
038	ZEC	002	012	And the Lord shall inherit Juda his portion in the holy [land], and he will yet choose Jerusalem.
038	ZEC	002	013	Let all flesh fear before the Lord: for he has risen up from his holy clouds.
038	ZEC	003	001	And the Lord shewed me Jesus the high priest standing before the angel of the Lord, and the Devil stood on his right hand to resist him.
038	ZEC	003	002	And the Lords said to the Devil, The Lord rebuke thee, O Devil, even the Lord that has chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: behold! is not this as a brand plucked from the fire?
038	ZEC	003	003	Now Jesus was clothed in filthy raiment, and stood before the angel.
038	ZEC	003	004	And [the Lord] answered and spoke to those who stood before him, saying, Take away the filthy raiment from him: and he said to him, Behold, I have taken away thine iniquities: and clothe ye him with a long robe,
038	ZEC	003	005	and place a pure mitre upon his head. So they placed a pure mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments: and the angel of the Lord stood [by].
038	ZEC	003	006	And the angel of the Lord testified to Jesus, saying,
038	ZEC	003	007	Thus saith the Lord Almighty; If thou wilt walk in my ways, and take heed to my charges, then shalt thou judge my house: and if thou wilt diligently keep my court, then will I give thee men to walk in the midst of these that stand [here].
038	ZEC	003	008	Hear now, Jesus the high priest, thou, and thy neighbours that are sitting before [thee]: for they are diviners, for, behold, I bring forth my servant The Branch.
038	ZEC	003	009	For [as for] the stone which I have set before the face of Jesus, on the one stone are seven eyes: behold, I am digging a trench, saith the Lord Almighty, and I will search out all the iniquity of that land in one day.
038	ZEC	003	010	In that day, saith the Lord Almighty, ye shall call together every man his neighbour under the vine and under the fig-tree.
038	ZEC	004	001	And the angel that talked with me returned, and awakened me, as when a man is awakened out of his sleep.
038	ZEC	004	002	And he said to me, What seest thou? And I said, I have seen, and behold a candlestick all of gold, and its bowl upon it, and seven lamps upon it, and seven oil funnels to the lamps upon it:
038	ZEC	004	003	and two olive-trees above it, one on the right of the bowl, and one on the left.
038	ZEC	004	004	And I inquired, and spoke to the angel that talked with me, saying, What are these things, [my] lord?
038	ZEC	004	005	And the angel that talked with me answered, and spoke to me, saying, Knowest thou not what these things are? And I said, No, [my] lord.
038	ZEC	004	006	And he answered and spoke to me, saying, This is the word of the Lord to Zorobabel, saying, Not by mighty power, nor by strength, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord Almighty.
038	ZEC	004	007	Who art thou, the great mountain before Zorobabel, that thou shouldest prosper? whereas I will bring out the stone of the inheritance, the grace of it the equal of [my] grace.
038	ZEC	004	008	And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
038	ZEC	004	009	The hands of Zorobabel have laid the foundation of this house, and his hands shall finish it: and thou shalt know that the Lord Almighty has sent me to thee.
038	ZEC	004	010	For who has despised the small days? surely they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet of tin in the hand of Zorobabel: these are the seven eyes that look upon all the earth.
038	ZEC	004	011	And I answered, and said to him, What are these two olive-trees, which are on the right and left hand of the candlestick?
038	ZEC	004	012	And I asked the second time, and said to him, What are the two branches of the olive-trees that are by the side of the two golden pipes that pour into and communicate with the golden oil funnels?
038	ZEC	004	013	And he said to me, Knowest thou not what these are? and I said, No, [my] lord.
038	ZEC	004	014	And he said, These are the two anointed ones [that] stand by the Lord of the whole earth.
038	ZEC	005	001	And I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked and behold a flying sickle.
038	ZEC	005	002	And he said to me, What seest thou? And I said, I see a flying sickle, of the length of twenty cubits, and of the breadth of ten cubits.
038	ZEC	005	003	And he said to me, This is the curse that goes forth over the face of the whole earth: for every thief shall be punished with death on this side, and every false swearer shall be punished on that side.
038	ZEC	005	004	And I will bring it forth, saith the Lord Almighty, and it shall enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of him that swears falsely by my name: and it shall rest in the midst of his house, and shall consume it, and the timber of it, and the stones of it.
038	ZEC	005	005	And the angel that talked with me went forth, and said to me, Lift up thine eyes, and see this that goes forth.
038	ZEC	005	006	And I said, What is it? And he said, This is the measure that goes forth. And he said, This is their iniquity in all the earth.
038	ZEC	005	007	And behold a talent of lead lifted up: and behold a woman sat in the midst of the measure.
038	ZEC	005	008	And he said, This is iniquity. And he cast it into the midst of the measure, and cast the weight of lead on the mouth of it.
038	ZEC	005	009	And I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, two women coming forth, and the wind was in their wings; and they had stork's wings: and they lifted up the measure between the earth and the sky.
038	ZEC	005	010	And I said to the angel that spoke with me, Whither do these carry away the measure?
038	ZEC	005	011	And he said to me, To build it a house in the land of Babylon, and to prepare [a place for it]; and they shall set it there on its own base.
038	ZEC	006	001	And I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, four chariots coming out from between two mountains; and the mountains were brazen mountains.
038	ZEC	006	002	In the first chariot [were] red horses; and in the second chariot black horses;
038	ZEC	006	003	and in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot piebald [and] ash-coloured horses.
038	ZEC	006	004	And I answered and said to the angel that talked with me, What are these, my Lord?
038	ZEC	006	005	And the angel that talked with me answered and said, These are the four winds of heaven, [and] they are going forth to stand before the Lord of all the earth.
038	ZEC	006	006	[As for the chariot] in which were the black horses, they went out to the land of the north; and the white went out after them; and the piebald went out to the land of the south.
038	ZEC	006	007	And the ash-coloured went out, and looked to go and compass the earth: and he said, Go, and compass the earth. And they compassed the earth.
038	ZEC	006	008	And he cried out and spoke to me, saying, Behold, these go out to the land of the north, and they have quieted mine anger in the land of the north.
038	ZEC	006	009	And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
038	ZEC	006	010	Take the things of the captivity from the chief men, and from the useful men of it, and from them that have understood it; and thou shalt enter in that day into the house of Josias the son of Sophonias that came out of Babylon.
038	ZEC	006	011	And thou shalt take silver and gold, and make crowns, and thou shalt put [them] upon the head of Jesus the son of Josedec the high priest;
038	ZEC	006	012	and thou shalt say to him, Thus saith the Lord Almighty; Behold the man whose name is The Branch; and he shall spring up from his stem, and build the house of the Lord.
038	ZEC	006	013	And he shall receive power, and shall sit and rule upon his throne; and there shall be a priest on his right hand, and a peaceable counsel shall be between [them] both.
038	ZEC	006	014	And the crown shall be to them that wait patiently, and to the useful men of the captivity, and to them that have known it, and for the favour of the son of Sophonias, and for a psalm in the house of the Lord.
038	ZEC	006	015	And they [that are] far from them shall come and build in the house of the Lord, and ye shall know that the Lord Almighty has sent me to you: and [this] shall come to pass, if ye will diligently hearken to the voice of the Lord your God.
038	ZEC	007	001	And it came to pass in the fourth year of Darius the king, [that] the word of the Lord came to Zacharias on the fourth [day] of the ninth month, which is Chaseleu.
038	ZEC	007	002	And Sarasar and Arbeseer the king and his men sent to Bethel, and [that] to propitiate the Lord,
038	ZEC	007	003	speaking to the priests that were in the house of the Lord Almighty, and to the prophets, saying, The holy offering has come in hither in the fifth month, as it has done already many years.
038	ZEC	007	004	And the word of the Lord of hosts came to me, saying,
038	ZEC	007	005	Speak to the whole people of the land, and to the priests, saying, Though ye fasted or lamented in the fifth or seventh [months] (yea, behold, these seventy years) have ye at all fasted to me?
038	ZEC	007	006	And if ye eat or drink, do ye not eat and drink for yourselves?
038	ZEC	007	007	Are not these the words which the Lord spoke by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity, and her cities round about her, and the hill country and the low country was inhabited?
038	ZEC	007	008	And the word of the Lord came to Zacharias, saying,
038	ZEC	007	009	Thus saith the Lord Almighty; Judge righteous judgment, and deal mercifully and compassionately every one with his brother:
038	ZEC	007	010	and oppress not the widow, or the fatherless, or the stranger, or the poor; and let not one of you remember in his heart the injury of his brother.
038	ZEC	007	011	But they refused to attend, and madly turned their back, and made their ears heavy, so that they should not hear.
038	ZEC	007	012	And they made their heart disobedient, so as not to hearken to my law, and the words which the Lord Almighty sent forth by his Spirit by the former prophets: so there was great wrath from the Lord Almighty.
038	ZEC	007	013	And it shall come to pass, [that] as he spoke, and they hearkened not, so they shall cry, and I will not hearken, saith the Lord Almighty.
038	ZEC	007	014	And I will cast them out among all the nations, whom they know not; and the land behind them shall be made utterly destitute of any going through or returning: yea they have made the choice land a desolation.
038	ZEC	008	001	And the word of the Lord Almighty came, saying,
038	ZEC	008	002	Thus saith the Lord Almighty; I have been jealous for Jerusalem and for Sion with great jealousy, and I have been jealous for her with great fury.
038	ZEC	008	003	Thus saith the Lord; I will return to Sion, and dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem shall be called a true city, and the mountain of the Lord Almighty a holy mountain.
038	ZEC	008	004	Thus saith the Lord Almighty; There shall yet dwell old men and old women in the streets of Jerusalem, every one holding his staff in his hand for age.
038	ZEC	008	005	And the broad places of the city shall be filled with boys and girls playing in the streets thereof.
038	ZEC	008	006	Thus saith the Lord Almighty; If it shall be impossible in the sight of the remnant of this people in those days, shall it also be impossible in my sight? saith the Lord Almighty.
038	ZEC	008	007	Thus saith the Lord Almighty; Behold, I [will] save my people from the east country, and the west country;
038	ZEC	008	008	and I will bring them in, and cause [them] to dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and they shall be to me a people, and I will be to them a God, in truth and in righteousness.
038	ZEC	008	009	Thus saith the Lord Almighty; Let your hands be strong, [ye that] hear in these days these words out of the mouth of the prophets, from the day that the house of the Lord Almighty was founded, and from the time that the temple was built.
038	ZEC	008	010	For before those days the wages of men could not be profitable, and there could be no hire of cattle, and there could be no peace by reason of the affliction to him that went out or to him that came in: for I would have let loose all men, every one against his neighbour.
038	ZEC	008	011	But now I [will] not do to the remnant of this people according to the former days, saith the Lord Almighty.
038	ZEC	008	012	But I will shew peace: the vine shall yield her fruit, and the land shall yield her produce, and the heaven shall give its dew: and I will give as an inheritance all these things to the remnant of my people.
038	ZEC	008	013	And it shall come to pass, as ye were a curse among the nations, O house of Juda, and house of Israel; so will I save you, and ye shall be a blessing: be of good courage, and strengthen your hands.
038	ZEC	008	014	For thus saith the Lord Almighty; As I took counsel to afflict you when your fathers provoked me, saith the Lord Almighty, and I repented not:
038	ZEC	008	015	so have I prepared and taken counsel in these days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Juda: be ye of good courage.
038	ZEC	008	016	These [are] the things which ye shall do; speak truth every one with his neighbour; judge truth and peaceable judgment in your gates:
038	ZEC	008	017	and let none of you devise evil in his heart against his neighbour; and love not a false oath: for all these things I hate, saith the Lord Almighty.
038	ZEC	008	018	And the word of the Lord Almighty came to me, saying,
038	ZEC	008	019	Thus saith the Lord Almighty, The fourth fast, and the fifth fast, and the seventh fast, and the tenth fast, shall be to the house of Juda for joy and gladness, and for good feasts; and ye shall rejoice; and love ye the truth and peace.
038	ZEC	008	020	Thus saith the Lord Almighty; Yet shall many peoples come, and the inhabitants of many cities;
038	ZEC	008	021	and the inhabitants of five cities shall come together to one city, saying, Let us go to make supplication to the Lord, and to seek the face of the Lord Almighty; I will go also.
038	ZEC	008	022	And many peoples and many nations shall come to seek earnestly the face of the Lord Almighty in Jerusalem, and to obtain favour of the Lord.
038	ZEC	008	023	Thus saith the Lord Almighty; In those days [my word shall be fulfilled] if ten men of all the languages of the nations should take hold—even take hold of the hem of a Jew, saying, We will go with thee; for we have heard that God is with you.
038	ZEC	009	001	The burden of the word of the Lord, in the land of Sedrach, and his sacrifice [shall be] in Damascus; for the Lord looks upon men, and upon all the tribes of Israel.
038	ZEC	009	002	And in Emath, [even] in her coasts, [are] Tyre and Sidon, because they were very wise.
038	ZEC	009	003	And Tyrus built strong-holds for herself, and heaped up silver as dust, and gathered gold as the mire of the ways.
038	ZEC	009	004	And therefore the Lord will take them for a possession, and will smite her power in the sea; and she shall be consumed with fire.
038	ZEC	009	005	Ascalon shall see, and fear; Gaza also, and shall be greatly pained, and Accaron; for she is ashamed at her trespass; and the king shall perish from Gaza, and Ascalon shall not be inhabited.
038	ZEC	009	006	And aliens shall dwell in Azotus, and I will bring down the pride of the Philistines.
038	ZEC	009	007	And I will take their blood out of their mouth, and their abominations from between their teeth; and these also shall be left to our God, and they shall be as a captain of a thousand in Juda, and Accaron as a Jebusite.
038	ZEC	009	008	And I will set up a defence for my house, that they may not pass through, nor turn back, neither shall there any more come upon them one to drive them away: for now have I seen with mine eyes.
038	ZEC	009	009	Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Sion; proclaim [it] aloud, O daughter of Jerusalem; behold, the King is coming to thee, just, and a Saviour; he is meek and riding on an ass, and a young foal.
038	ZEC	009	010	And he shall destroy the chariots out of Ephraim, and the horse out of Jerusalem, and the bow of war shall be utterly destroyed; and [there shall be] abundance and peace out of the nations; and he shall rule over the waters as far as the sea, and the rivers [to] the ends of the earth.
038	ZEC	009	011	And thou by the blood of thy covenant has sent forth thy prisoners out of the pit that has no water.
038	ZEC	009	012	Ye shall dwell in strongholds, ye prisoners of the congregation: and for one day of thy captivity I will recompense thee double.
038	ZEC	009	013	For I have bent thee, O Juda, for myself [as] a bow, I have filled Ephraim; and I will raise up thy children, O Sion, against the children of the Greeks, and I will handle thee as the sword of a warrior.
038	ZEC	009	014	And the Lord shall be over them, and [his] arrow shall go forth as lightning: and the Lord Almighty shall blow with the trumpet; and shall proceed with the tumult of his threatening.
038	ZEC	009	015	The Lord Almighty shall protect them, and they shall destroy them, and overwhelm them with sling-stones; and they shall swallow them down as wine, and fill the bowls as the altar.
038	ZEC	009	016	And the Lord their God shall save them in that day, [even] his people as a flock; for holy stones are rolled upon his land.
038	ZEC	009	017	For if he has anything good, and if he has anything fair, the young [men shall have] corn, and [there shall be] fragrant wine to the virgins.
038	ZEC	010	001	Ask ye of the Lord rain in season, the early and the latter: the Lord has given bright signs, and will give them abundant rain, to every one grass in the field.
038	ZEC	010	002	For the speakers have uttered grievous things, and the diviners [have] [seen] false visions, and they have spoken false dreams, they have given vain comfort: therefore have they fallen away like sheep, and been afflicted, because there was no healing.
038	ZEC	010	003	Mine anger was kindled against the shepherds, and I will visit the lambs; and the Lord God Almighty shall visit his flock, the house of Juda, and he shall make them as his goodly horse in war.
038	ZEC	010	004	And from him he looked, and from him he set [the battle in order], and from him [came] the bow in anger, [and] from him shall come forth every oppressor together.
038	ZEC	010	005	And they shall be as warriors treading clay in the ways in war; and they shall set the battle in array, because the Lord is with them, and the riders on horses shall be put to shame.
038	ZEC	010	006	And I will strengthen the house of Juda, and save the house of Joseph, and I will settle them; because I have loved them: and they shall be as [if] I had not cast them off: for I am the Lord their God, and I will hear them.
038	ZEC	010	007	And they shall be as the warriors of Ephraim, and their heart shall rejoice as with wine: and their children also shall see [it], and be glad; and their heart shall rejoice in the Lord.
038	ZEC	010	008	I will make a sign to them, and gather them in; for I will redeem them, and they shall be multiplied according to their number before.
038	ZEC	010	009	And I will sow them among the people; and they that are afar off shall remember me: they shall nourish their children, and they shall return.
038	ZEC	010	010	And I will bring them again from the land of Egypt, and I will gather them in from among the Assyrians; and I will bring them into the land of Galaad and to Libanus; and there shall not even one of them be left behind.
038	ZEC	010	011	And they shall pass through a narrow sea, they shall smite the waves in the sea, and all the deep places of the rivers shall be dried up: and all the pride of the Assyrians shall be taken away, and the sceptre of Egypt shall be removed.
038	ZEC	010	012	And I will strengthen them in the Lord their God; and they shall boast in his name, saith the Lord.
038	ZEC	011	001	Open thy doors, O Libanus, and let the fire devour thy cedars.
038	ZEC	011	002	Let the pine howl, because the cedar has fallen; for the mighty men have been greatly afflicted: howl, ye oaks of the land of Basan; for the thickly planted forest has been torn down.
038	ZEC	011	003	[There is] a voice of the shepherds mourning; for their greatness is brought low: a voice of roaring lions; for the pride of Jordan is brought down.
038	ZEC	011	004	Thus saith the Lord Almighty, Feed the sheep of the slaughter;
038	ZEC	011	005	which their possessors have slain, and have not repented: and they that sold them said, Blessed be the Lord; for we have become rich: and their shepherds have suffered no sorrow for them.
038	ZEC	011	006	Therefore I will no longer have mercy upon the inhabitants of the land, saith the Lord: but, behold, I will deliver up the men every one into the hand of his neighbour, and into the hand of his king; and they shall destroy the land, and I will not rescue out of their hand.
038	ZEC	011	007	And I will tend the flock of slaughter in the land of Chanaan: and I will take for myself two rods; the one I called Beauty, and the other I called Line; and I will tend the flock.
038	ZEC	011	008	And I will cut off three shepherds in one month; and my soul shall grieve over them, for their souls cried out against me.
038	ZEC	011	009	And I said, I will not tend you: that which dies, let it die; and that which falls off, let it fall off; and let the rest eat every one the flesh of his neighbour.
038	ZEC	011	010	And I will take my beautiful staff, and cast it away, that I may break my covenant which I made with all the people.
038	ZEC	011	011	And it shall be broken in that day; and the Chananites, the sheep that are kept for me, shall know that it is the word of the Lord.
038	ZEC	011	012	And I will say to them, If it be good in your eyes, give [me] my price, or refuse it. And they weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver.
038	ZEC	011	013	And the Lord said to me, Drop them into the furnace, and I will see if it is good [metal], as I was proved for their sakes. And I took the thirty pieces of silver, and cast them into the furnace in the house of the Lord.
038	ZEC	011	014	And I cast away [my] second rod, [even] Line, that I might break the possession between Juda and Israel.
038	ZEC	011	015	And the Lord said to me, Take yet to thee shepherd's implements belonging to an unskillful shepherd.
038	ZEC	011	016	For, behold, I [will] raise up a shepherd against the land: he shall not visit that which is perishing, and he shall not seek that which is scattered, and he shall not heal that which is bruised, nor guide that which is whole: but he shall devour the flesh of the choice [ones], and shall dislocate the joints [of their necks].
038	ZEC	011	017	Alas for the vain shepherds that have forsaken the sheep! the sword [shall be] upon the arms of such a one, and upon his right eye: his arm shall be completely withered, and his right eye shall be utterly darkened.
038	ZEC	012	001	The burden of the word of the Lord for Israel; saith the Lord, that stretches out the sky, and lays the foundation of the earth, and forms the spirit of man within him.
038	ZEC	012	002	Behold, I [will] make Jerusalem as trembling door-posts to all the nations round about, and in Judea there shall be a siege against Jerusalem.
038	ZEC	012	003	And it shall come to pass in that day [that] I will make Jerusalem a trodden stone to all the nations: every one that tramples on it shall utterly mock at [it], and all the nations of the earth shall be gathered together against it.
038	ZEC	012	004	In that day, saith the Lord Almighty, I will smite every horse with amazement, and his rider with madness: but I will open mine eyes upon the house of Juda, and I will smite all the horses of the nations with blindness.
038	ZEC	012	005	And the captains of thousands of Juda shall say in their hearts, We shall find for ourselves the inhabitants of Jerusalem in the Lord Almighty their God.
038	ZEC	012	006	In that day I will make the captains of thousands of Juda as a firebrand among wood, and as a torch of fire in stubble; and they shall devour on the right hand and on the left all the nations round about: and Jerusalem shall dwell again by herself, [even] in Jerusalem.
038	ZEC	012	007	And the Lord shall save the tabernacles of Juda as at the beginning, that the boast of the house of David, and the pride of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, may not magnify themselves against Juda.
038	ZEC	012	008	And it shall come to pass in that day, [that] the Lord shall defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and the weak one among them in that day shall be as David, and the house of David as the house of God, as the angel of the Lord before them.
038	ZEC	012	009	And it shall come to pass in that day, [that] I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.
038	ZEC	012	010	And I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and compassion: and they shall look upon me, because they have mocked [me], and they shall make lamentation for him, as for a beloved [friend], and they shall grieve intensely, as for a firstborn [son].
038	ZEC	012	011	In that day the lamentation in Jerusalem shall be very great, as the mourning for the pomegranate grove cut down in the plain.
038	ZEC	012	012	And the land shall lament in separate families, the family of the house of David by itself, and their wives by themselves; the family of the house of Nathan by itself, and their wives by themselves;
038	ZEC	012	013	the family of the house of Levi by itself, and their wives by themselves; the family of Symeon by itself, and their wives by themselves;
038	ZEC	012	014	all the families that are left, each family by itself, and their wives by themselves.
038	ZEC	013	001	In that day every place shall be opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for removal and for separation.
038	ZEC	013	002	And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord of hosts, [that] I will utterly destroy the names of the idols from off the land, and there shall be no longer [any] remembrance of them: and I will cut off the false prophets and the evil spirit from the land.
038	ZEC	013	003	And it shall come to pass, if a man will yet prophesy, that his father and his mother which gave birth to him shall say to him, Thou shalt not live; for thou has spoken lies in the name of the Lord: and his father and his mother who gave him birth shall bind him as he is prophesying.
038	ZEC	013	004	And it shall come to pass in that day, [that] the prophets shall be ashamed every one of his vision when he prophesies; and they shall clothe themselves with a garment of hair, because they have lied.
038	ZEC	013	005	And [one] shall say, I am not a prophet, for I am a tiller of the ground, for a man brought me up [thus] from my youth.
038	ZEC	013	006	And I will say to him, What are these wounds between thine hands? and he shall say, [Those] with which I was wounded in my beloved house.
038	ZEC	013	007	Awake, O sword, against my shepherds, and against the man [who is] my citizen, saith the Lord Almighty: smite the shepherds, and draw out the sheep: and I will bring mine hand upon the little ones.
038	ZEC	013	008	And it shall come to pass, [that] in all the land, saith the Lord, two parts thereof shall be cut off and perish; but the third shall be left therein.
038	ZEC	013	009	And I will bring the third [part] through the fire, and I will try them as silver is tried, and I will prove them as gold is proved: they shall call upon my name, and I will hear them, and say, This is my people: and they shall say, The Lord [is] my God.
038	ZEC	014	001	Behold, the days of the Lord come, and thy spoils shall be divided in thee.
038	ZEC	014	002	And I will gather all the Gentiles to Jerusalem to war, and the city shall be taken, and the houses plundered, and the women ravished; and half of the city shall go forth into captivity, but the rest of my people shall not be utterly cut off from the city.
038	ZEC	014	003	And the Lord shall go forth, and fight with those Gentiles as when he fought in the day of war.
038	ZEC	014	004	And his feet shall stand in that day on the mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east, and the mount of Olives shall cleave asunder, half of it toward the east and the west, a very great division; and half the mountain shall lean to the north, and half of it to the south.
038	ZEC	014	005	And the valley of my mountains shall be closed up, and the valley of the mountains shall be joined on to Jasod, and shall be blocked up as it was blocked up in the days of the earthquake, in the days of Ozias king of Juda; and the Lord my God shall come, and all the saints with him.
038	ZEC	014	006	And it shall come to pass in that day that there shall be no light,
038	ZEC	014	007	and there shall be for one day cold and frost, and that day [shall be] known to the Lord, and [it shall] not [be] day nor night: but towards evening it shall be light.
038	ZEC	014	008	And in that day living water shall come forth out of Jerusalem; half of it toward the former sea, and half of it toward the latter sea: and so shall it be in summer and spring.
038	ZEC	014	009	And the Lord shall be king over all the earth: in that day there shall be one Lord, and his name one,
038	ZEC	014	010	compassing all the earth, and the wilderness from Gabe unto Remmon south of Jerusalem. And Rama shall remain in its place. From the gate of Benjamin to the place of the first gate, to the gate of the corners, and to the tower of Anameel, as far as the king's winepresses,
038	ZEC	014	011	they shall dwell in the city; and there shall be no more any curse, and Jerusalem shall dwell securely.
038	ZEC	014	012	And this shall be the overthrow with which the Lord will smite all the nations, as many as have fought against Jerusalem; their flesh shall consume away while they are standing upon their feet, and their eyes shall melt out of their holes, and their tongue shall consume away in their mouth.
038	ZEC	014	013	And there shall be in that day a great panic from the Lord upon them; and they shall lay hold every man of the hand of his neighbour, and his hand shall be clasped with the hand of his neighbour.
038	ZEC	014	014	Juda also shall fight in Jerusalem; and [God] shall gather the strength of all the nations round about, gold, and silver, and apparel, in great abundance.
038	ZEC	014	015	And this shall be the overthrow of the horses, and mules, and camels, and asses, and all the beasts that are in those camps, according to this overthrow.
038	ZEC	014	016	And it shall come to pass, [that] whosoever shall be left of all the nations that came against Jerusalem, shall even come up every year to worship the king, the Lord Almighty, and to keep the feast of tabernacles.
038	ZEC	014	017	And it shall come to pass, [that] whosoever of all the families of the earth shall not come up to Jerusalem to worship the king, the Lord Almighty, even these shall be added to the others.
038	ZEC	014	018	And if the family of Egypt shall not go up, nor come; then upon them shall be the overthrow with which the Lord shall smite all the nations, whichever of them shall not come up to keep the feast of tabernacles.
038	ZEC	014	019	This shall be the sin of Egypt, and the sin of all the nations, whosoever shall not come up to keep the feast of tabernacles.
038	ZEC	014	020	In that day there shall be upon the bridle of every horse Holiness to the Lord Almighty; and the caldrons in the house of the Lord shall be as bowls before the altar.
038	ZEC	014	021	And every pot in Jerusalem and in Juda shall be holy to the Lord Almighty: and all that sacrifice shall come and take of them, and shall seethe [meat] in them: and in that day there shall be no more the Chananite in the house of the Lord Almighty.

# BOOK	039	MAL	Malachi	Malachias
039	MAL	001	001	The burden of the word of the Lord to Israel by the hand of his messenger. Lay [it], I pray you, to heart.
039	MAL	001	002	I have loved you, saith the Lord. And ye said, Wherein hast thou loved us? Was not Esau Jacob's brother? saith the Lord: yet I loved Jacob,
039	MAL	001	003	and hated Esau and laid waste his borders, and made his heritage as dwellings of the wilderness?
039	MAL	001	004	Because one will say, Idumea has been overthrown, but let us return and rebuild the desolate places; thus saith the Lord Almighty, They shall build, but I will throw down; and they shall be called The borders of wickedness, and, The people against whom the Lord has set himself for ever.
039	MAL	001	005	And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, The Lord has been magnified upon the borders of Israel.
039	MAL	001	006	A son honours [his] father, and a servant his master: if then I am a father, where is mine honour? and if I am a master, where is my fear? saith the Lord Almighty. Ye the priests are they that despise my name: yet ye said, Wherein have we despised thy name?
039	MAL	001	007	In that ye bring to mine altar polluted bread; and ye said, Wherein have ye polluted it? In that ye say, The table of the Lord is polluted, and that which was set thereon ye have despised.
039	MAL	001	008	For if ye bring a blind [victim] for sacrifices, [is it] not evil? and if ye bring the lame or the sick, [is it] not evil? offer it now to thy ruler, [and see] if he will receive thee, if he will accept thy person, saith the Lord Almighty.
039	MAL	001	009	And now intreat the face of your God, and make supplication to him. These things have been done by your hands; shall I accept you? saith the Lord Almighty.
039	MAL	001	010	Because even among you the doors shall be shut, and [one] will not kindle [the fire of] mine altar for nothing, I have no pleasure in you, saith the Lord Almighty, and I will not accept a sacrifice at your hands.
039	MAL	001	011	For from the rising of the sun even to the going down [thereof] my name has been glorified among the Gentiles; and in every place incense is offered to my name, and a pure offering: for my name is great among the Gentiles, saith the Lord Almighty.
039	MAL	001	012	But ye profane it, in that ye say, The table of the Lord is polluted, and his meats set thereon are despised.
039	MAL	001	013	And ye said, These [services] are troublesome: therefore I have utterly rejected them with scorn, saith the Lord Almighty: and ye brought in torn victims, and lame, and sick: if then ye should bring an offering, shall I accept them at your hands? saith the Lord Almighty.
039	MAL	001	014	And cursed [is the man] who had the power, and possessed a male in his flock, and whose vow is upon him, and who sacrifices a corrupt thing to the Lord: for I am a great King, saith the Lord Almighty, and my name is glorious among the nations.
039	MAL	002	001	And now, O priests, this commandment is to you.
039	MAL	002	002	If ye will not hearken, and if ye will not lay [it] to heart, to give glory to my name, saith the Lord Almighty, then I will send forth the curse upon you, and I will bring a curse upon your blessing: yea, I will curse it, and I will scatter your blessing, and it shall not exist among you, because ye lay not this to heart.
039	MAL	002	003	Behold, I turn my back upon you, and I will scatter dung upon your faces, the dung of your feasts, and I will carry you away at the same time.
039	MAL	002	004	And ye shall know that I have sent this commandment to you, that my covenant might be with the sons of Levi, saith the Lord Almighty.
039	MAL	002	005	My covenant of life and peace was with him, and I gave [it] him that he might reverently fear me, and that he might be awe-struck at my name.
039	MAL	002	006	The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found in his lips: he walked before me directing [his way] in peace, and he turned many from unrighteousness.
039	MAL	002	007	For the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth: for he is the messenger of the Lord Almighty.
039	MAL	002	008	But ye have turned aside from the way, and caused many to fail in [following] the law: ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi, saith the Lord Almighty.
039	MAL	002	009	And I have made you despised and cast out among all the people, because ye have not kept my ways, but have been partial in the law.
039	MAL	002	010	Have ye not all one father? Did not one God create you? why have ye forsaken every man his brother, to profane the covenant of your fathers?
039	MAL	002	011	Juda has been forsaken, and an abomination has been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Juda has profaned the holy things of the Lord, which he delighted in, and has gone after other gods.
039	MAL	002	012	The Lord will utterly destroy the man that does these things, until he be even cast down from out of the tabernacles of Jacob, and from among them that offer sacrifice to the Lord Almighty.
039	MAL	002	013	And these things which I hated, ye did: ye covered with tears the altar of the Lord, and with weeping and groaning because of troubles: [is it] meet [for me] to have respect to your sacrifice, or to receive [anything] from your hands [as] welcome?
039	MAL	002	014	Yet ye said, Wherefore? Because the Lord has borne witness between thee and the wife of thy youth, whom thou has forsaken, and [yet] she was thy partner, and the wife of thy covenant.
039	MAL	002	015	And did he not do well? and [there was] the residue of his spirit. But ye said, What does God seek but a seed? But take ye heed to your spirit, and forsake not the wife of thy youth.
039	MAL	002	016	But if thou shouldest hate [thy wife] and put her away, saith the Lord God of Israel, then ungodliness shall cover thy thoughts, saith the Lord Almighty: therefore take ye heed to your spirit, and forsake [them] not,
039	MAL	002	017	ye that have provoked God with your words. But ye said, Wherein have we provoked him? In that ye say, Every one that does evil is a pleasing [object] in the sight of the Lord, and he takes pleasure in such; and where is the God of justice?
039	MAL	003	001	Behold, I send forth my messenger, and he shall survey the way before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come into his temple, even the angel of the covenant, whom ye take pleasure in: behold, he is coming, saith the Lord Almighty.
039	MAL	003	002	And who will abide the day of his coming? or who will withstand at his appearing? for he is coming in as the fire of a furnace and as the herb of fullers.
039	MAL	003	003	He shall sit to melt and purify as it were silver, and as it were gold: and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and refine them as gold and silver, and they shall offer to the Lord an offering in righteousness.
039	MAL	003	004	And the sacrifice of Juda and Jerusalem shall be pleasing to the Lord, according to the former days, and according to the former years.
039	MAL	003	005	And I will draw near to you in judgment; and I will be a sift witness against the witches, and against the adulteresses, and against them that swear falsely by my name, and against them that keep back the hireling's wages, and them that oppress the widow, and afflict orphans, and that wrest the judgment of the stranger, and fear not me, saith the Lord Almighty.
039	MAL	003	006	For I am the Lord your God, and I am not changed:
039	MAL	003	007	but ye, the sons of Jacob, have not refrained from the iniquities of your fathers: ye have perverted my statutes, and have not kept them. Return to me, and I will return to you, saith the Lord Almighty. But ye said, Wherein shall we return?
039	MAL	003	008	Will a man insult God? for ye insult me. But ye say, Wherein have we insulted thee? In that the tithes and first-fruits are with you [still].
039	MAL	003	009	And ye do surely look off from me, and ye insult me.
039	MAL	003	010	The year is completed, and ye have brought all the produce into the storehouses; but there shall be the plunder thereof in its house: return now on this behalf, saith the Lord Almighty, [see] if I will not open to you the torrents of heaven, and pour out my blessing upon you, until ye are satisfied.
039	MAL	003	011	And I will appoint food for you, and I will not destroy the fruit of your land; and your vine in the field shall not fail, saith the Lord Almighty.
039	MAL	003	012	And all nations shall call you blessed: for ye shall be a desirable land, saith the Lord Almighty.
039	MAL	003	013	Ye have spoken grievous words against me, saith the Lord. Yet ye said, Wherein have we spoken against thee?
039	MAL	003	014	Ye said, He that serves God labours in vain: and what have we gained in that we have kept his ordinances, and in that we have walked as suppliants before the face of the Lord Almighty?
039	MAL	003	015	And now we pronounce strangers blessed; and all they who act unlawfully are built up; and they have resisted God, and [yet] have been delivered.
039	MAL	003	016	Thus spoke they that feared the Lord, every one to his neighbour: and the Lord gave heed, and hearkened, and he wrote a book of remembrance before him for them that feared the Lord and reverenced his name.
039	MAL	003	017	And they shall be mine, saith the Lord Almighty, in the day which I appoint for a peculiar possession; and I will make choice of them, as a man makes choice of his son that serves him.
039	MAL	003	018	Then shall ye return, and discern between the righteous and the wicked, and between him that serves God, and him that serves [him] not.
039	MAL	004	001	For, behold, a day comes burning as an oven, and it shall consume them; and all the aliens, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that is coming shall set them on fire, saith the Lord Almighty, and there shall not be left of them root or branch.
039	MAL	004	002	But to you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise, and healing [shall be] in his wings: and ye shall go forth, and bound as young calves let loose from bonds.
039	MAL	004	003	And ye shall trample the wicked; for they shall be ashes underneath your feet in the day which I appoint, saith the Lord Almighty.
039	MAL	004	004	And, behold, I will send to you Elias the Thesbite, before the great and glorious day of the Lord comes;
039	MAL	004	005	who shall turn again the heart of the father to the son, and the heart of a man to his neighbour, lest I come and smite the earth grievously.
039	MAL	004	006	Remember the law of my servant Moses, accordingly as I charged him [with it] in Choreb for all Israel, [even] the commandments and ordinances.
