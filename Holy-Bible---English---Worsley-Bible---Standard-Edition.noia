# BOOK	040	MAT	Matthew	Matthew
040	MAT	001	001	The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.
040	MAT	001	002	Abraham begat Isaac, and Isaac begat Jacob, and Jacob begat Judah and his brethren;
040	MAT	001	003	and Judah had Phares and Zara by Thamar; and Phares begat Esrom,
040	MAT	001	004	and Esrom begat Aram, and Aram begat Aminadab, and Aminadab begat Naasson, and Naasson begat Salmon,
040	MAT	001	005	and Salmon had Booz by Rahab, and Booz had Obed by Ruth,
040	MAT	001	006	and Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David the king, and David had Solomon by her who had been the wife of Uriah.
040	MAT	001	007	And Solomon begat Roboam, and Roboam begat Abia,
040	MAT	001	008	and Abia begat Asa, and Asa begat Josaphat, and Josaphat begat Joram,
040	MAT	001	009	and Joram begat Ozias, and Ozias begat Joatham, and Joatham begat Ahaz, and Ahaz begat Ezechias,
040	MAT	001	010	and Ezechias begat Manasses, and Manasses begat Amon,
040	MAT	001	011	and Amon begat Josias, and Josias begat Jakim, and Jakim begat Jechonias and his brethren, about the time of their being carried away to Babylon.
040	MAT	001	012	And after the captivity of Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel,
040	MAT	001	013	and Salathiel begat Zorobabel, and Zorobabel begat Abiud, and Abiud begat Eliakim, and Eliakim begat Azor,
040	MAT	001	014	and Azor begat Sadok, and Sadok begat Achim,
040	MAT	001	015	and Achim begat Eliud, and Eliud begat Eleazar, and Eleazar begat Matthan, and Matthan begat Jacob,
040	MAT	001	016	and Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus who is called Christ.
040	MAT	001	017	All the generations therefore from Abraham to David are fourteen generations: and from David until the captivity of Babylon fourteen generations: and from the Babylonish captivity unto Christ, fourteen generations.
040	MAT	001	018	Now the birth of Jesus Christ was in wise: when Mary his mother was promised in marriage to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child by the Holy Ghost:
040	MAT	001	019	but Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing publicly to expose her, was inclined to break off the contract with her privately;
040	MAT	001	020	and when he was thinking on these things, behold an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph thou Son of David, scruple not to take unto thee Mary thy wife; for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.
040	MAT	001	021	And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins.
040	MAT	001	022	(Now all this came to pass, that it might be fulfilled, which the Lord spake by the prophet, saying,
040	MAT	001	023	"Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel," which is God with us.)
040	MAT	001	024	So Joseph, when he awoke from his sleep, did as the angel of the Lord directed him, and took home his wife:
040	MAT	001	025	and he knew her not, till she brought forth her Son the first-born, and he called his name Jesus.
040	MAT	002	001	Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, in the days of king Herod, behold, there came certain wise men from the east to Jerusalem,
040	MAT	002	002	saying, Where is the king of the Jews that is born here? for we have seen his star in the east and are come to worship Him.
040	MAT	002	003	And when Herod the king heard it, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him:
040	MAT	002	004	and having summoned together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he enquired of them where the Messiah was to be born: and they told him, at Bethlehem in Judea;
040	MAT	002	005	for thus it is written by the prophet,
040	MAT	002	006	"And thou Bethlehem in the land of Juda art not the meanest among the cities of the princes of Juda; for out of thee shall come forth a ruler, that shall feed my people Israel."
040	MAT	002	007	Then Herod called the wise men to him privately, and inquired of them exactly the time of the star's appearing:
040	MAT	002	008	and sending them to Bethlehem, he said, Go and make diligent search for the child, and when ye have found Him, let me know, that I also may come and worship Him.
040	MAT	002	009	When they had heard the king, they went: and lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went on before them, till it came and stood over the place where the child was.
040	MAT	002	010	And when they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy;
040	MAT	002	011	and coming into the house, they found the child with Mary his mother, and they fell down and worshipped Him: and when they had opened their treasures, they brought Him presents, of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
040	MAT	002	012	And being warned of God in a dream not to return to Herod, they went back into their own country another way.
040	MAT	002	013	And when they were departed, behold an angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Rise and take the child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and continue there, untill I tell thee to return: for Herod will seek the child to destroy Him.
040	MAT	002	014	And he arose and took the child and his mother by night, and went away into Egypt:
040	MAT	002	015	and stayed there till the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which the Lord spake by the prophet, saying, " Out of Egypt have I called my Son."
040	MAT	002	016	Then Herod, when he saw that he was baffled by the wise-men, was very much enraged; and he sent and slew all the male-children in Bethlehem, and in all its borders, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had exactly inquired of the wise-men.
040	MAT	002	017	Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremias the prophet,
040	MAT	002	018	saying, In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel bewailing her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not.
040	MAT	002	019	But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,
040	MAT	002	020	saying, Arise and take the child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they, that sought the child's life, are dead.
040	MAT	002	021	And he arose, and took the child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel:
040	MAT	002	022	but when he heard that Archelaus reigned over Judea in the room of Herod his father, he was afraid to go thither; however being warned of God in a dream, he retired into the district of Galilee.
040	MAT	002	023	And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.
040	MAT	003	001	Now in those days came John the baptist preaching in the desert part of Judea,
040	MAT	003	002	and saying, Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand:
040	MAT	003	003	for this is He who was spoken of by Esaias the prophet, saying, The voice of one crying in the desert, "Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight."
040	MAT	003	004	And this John had his clothes of camels hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins, and his food was locusts and wild honey.
040	MAT	003	005	Then went, out to him Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all the country about Jordan,
040	MAT	003	006	and they were baptized by him in Jordan, confessing their sins.
040	MAT	003	007	But when he saw many of the pharisees and sadducees coming to his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
040	MAT	003	008	Bring forth therefore fruits becoming: penitents: and do not say within your selves,
040	MAT	003	009	"We have Abraham for our father:" for I tell you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham.
040	MAT	003	010	And now the ax is laid to the root of the trees; every tree therefore, which yieldeth not good fruit, is cut down and cast into the fire.
040	MAT	003	011	I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance; but He that cometh after me, is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to carry: He shall baptize you with the holy Spirit and with fire.
040	MAT	003	012	Whose fan is in his hand, and He will thoroughly cleanse his floor, and gather the wheat into his granary, but will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.
040	MAT	003	013	Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized by him: but John refused Him, saying,
040	MAT	003	014	I have need to be baptized by thee, and comest thou to me?
040	MAT	003	015	And Jesus answering said unto him, Permit it now; for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness.
040	MAT	003	016	Then he permitted Him. And Jesus as soon as He was baptized came up from the water; and behold, the heavens were opened unto Him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and coming upon Him:
040	MAT	003	017	and lo, a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.
040	MAT	004	001	Then was Jesus led by the spirit into the wilderness, to be tempted by the devil:
040	MAT	004	002	and when He had fasted forty days and forty nights, at last He was very hungry.
040	MAT	004	003	And the tempter came to Him and said, If thou art the Son of God, command these stones to become bread:
040	MAT	004	004	but He answered and said, It is written, "Man shall not live upon bread only, but on whatever proceedeth from the mouth of God."
040	MAT	004	005	Then the devil taketh Him into the holy city, and setteth Him on a wing of the temple,
040	MAT	004	006	and saith unto Him, If thou art the Son of God, cast thyself down; for it is written, He will give his angels charge concerning thee, and they shall bear thee up as in their hands, least at any time thou shouldst dash thy foot against a stone:
040	MAT	004	007	but Jesus said unto him, it is also written, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.
040	MAT	004	008	Again the devil taketh Him to a very high mountain, and sheweth Him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them;
040	MAT	004	009	and saith unto Him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me:
040	MAT	004	010	then Jesus saith unto him, Be gone, Satan; for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God,
040	MAT	004	011	and Him only shalt thou serve. Then the devil left Him, and behold angels came and attended Him.
040	MAT	004	012	Now when Jesus heard that John was imprisoned, He departed into Galilee:
040	MAT	004	013	and leaving Nazareth He came and dwelt in Capernaum a maritime town, on the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim:
040	MAT	004	014	that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, "The land of Zabulon,
040	MAT	004	015	and Nephthalim, by the way of the sea,
040	MAT	004	016	about Jordan, Galilee of the gentiles, the people that sat in darkness, saw a great light, and to them, who sat in the region and shadow of death, light is sprung up."
040	MAT	004	017	From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
040	MAT	004	018	Now as Jesus was walking by the sea of Galilee, He saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea; (for they were fishermen:)
040	MAT	004	019	and He saith unto them, Come with me, and I will make you fishers of men:
040	MAT	004	020	and they immediately left their nets, and followed Him.
040	MAT	004	021	And going on from thence He saw two other brethren, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets;
040	MAT	004	022	and He called them also; and they immediately left the ship, and their father, and followed Him.
040	MAT	004	023	And Jesus went through all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom of heaven, and healing every disease and every malady among the people.
040	MAT	004	024	And his fame spread abroad into all Syria; and they brought unto Him all their sick, that laboured under various diseases and torments; even those who were possessed with devils, and lunatics, and paralytics; and he healed them:
040	MAT	004	025	and great multitudes of people followed Him from Galilee, and Decapolis, and Jerusalem, and Judea, yea and from beyond Jordan.
040	MAT	005	001	And seeing the multitudes He went up to a mountain, and when He was set down, His disciples came to Him,
040	MAT	005	002	and He opened his mouth and taught them, saying,
040	MAT	005	003	Blessed are the poor in spirit; for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
040	MAT	005	004	Blessed are they that mourn; for they shall be comforted.
040	MAT	005	005	Blessed are the meek; for they shall inherit the earth.
040	MAT	005	006	Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness; for they shall be satisfied.
040	MAT	005	007	Blessed are the merciful; for they shall obtain mercy.
040	MAT	005	008	Blessed are the pure in heart; for they shall see God.
040	MAT	005	009	Blessed are the peace-makers; for they shall be called the children of God.
040	MAT	005	010	Blessed are they, who are persecuted for righteousness sake; for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
040	MAT	005	011	Blessed are ye when men shall revile and persecute you, and utter all manner of reproach against you falsly, for my sake:
040	MAT	005	012	rejoice and be exceeding glad; for great will be your reward in heaven: for so they persecuted the prophets, that were before you.
040	MAT	005	013	Ye are the salt of the earth, but if the salt be grown insipid, wherewith shall it be seasoned? it is no longer fit for any thing, but to be thrown out of doors, and trodden under foot.
040	MAT	005	014	Ye are the light of the world: a city, that is situated on a hill, cannot be hid.
040	MAT	005	015	Nor do men light a candle, to put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick: and then it giveth light to all in the house.
040	MAT	005	016	So let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your father, who is in heaven.
040	MAT	005	017	Think not that I am come to abrogate the law, or the prophets: I am not come to abolish, but to compleat them:
040	MAT	005	018	for verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass away, not one jot nor one tittle shall pass from the law, till all be compleated.
040	MAT	005	019	Whosoever therefore shall break one of the left of these commandments, and thereby teach men so to do, he shall be esteemed very little in the kingdom of heaven: but whoever shall do as well as teach them, he shall be accounted great in the kingdom of heaven.
040	MAT	005	020	For I tell you, that unless your righteousness exceed that of the scribes and pharisees, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.
040	MAT	005	021	Ye have heard, that it was said to the ancients, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever committeth murder, shall be liable to the judgment:
040	MAT	005	022	but I say unto you, that whosoever is angry with his brother without cause shall be liable to the judgment; and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be obnoxious to the council; but whosoever shall say, "Thou fool," shall be in danger of hell-fire.
040	MAT	005	023	Therefore, if thou bring thine offering to the altar, and there remembrest that thy brother hath any complaint against thee;
040	MAT	005	024	leave thy gift there before the altar, and go and first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.
040	MAT	005	025	Be friends with thine adversary quickly, while thou art in the way with him; least the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison:
040	MAT	005	026	verily, I say unto thee, thou shalt not come out from thence, till thou hast paid the very last farthing.
040	MAT	005	027	Ye have heard, that it was said to the ancients, Thou shalt not commit adultery:
040	MAT	005	028	but I tell you, that whosoever looketh on a woman, so as to lust after her, hath already debauched her in his heart.
040	MAT	005	029	And therefore if thy right eye cause thee to offend, pluck it out and cast it from thee; for it is better for thee that one part of thee perish, than that thy whole body should be cast into hell:
040	MAT	005	030	and if thy right hand cause thee to offend, cut it off and cast it from thee; for it is better for thee that one of thy limbs should perish, than that thy whole body should be cast into hell.
040	MAT	005	031	And it has been said, whosoever would put away his wife, let him give her a bill of divorce:
040	MAT	005	032	but I say unto you, that whosoever shall put away his wife, except on account of whoredom, tempteth her to commit adultery; and if any man marry her that is divorced, he committeth adultery.
040	MAT	005	033	Again, ye have heard, that it was said to the ancients, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths:
040	MAT	005	034	but I say unto you, swear not at all; neither by heaven, for it is the throne of God;
040	MAT	005	035	nor by the earth, for it is his footstool; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King: neither shalt thou swear by thy head,
040	MAT	005	036	for thou canst not make one hair of it white or black:
040	MAT	005	037	but let your conversation be yea, yea; no, no; for whatever is more than these, cometh from the evil one.
040	MAT	005	038	Ye have heard, that it has been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:
040	MAT	005	039	but I say unto you, Set not yourselves against him that injures you, but if any one smite thee on thy right cheek, rather turn to him the other also:
040	MAT	005	040	and if any one would go to law with thee, to take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also, rather than strive with him:
040	MAT	005	041	and if any one shall force thee one mile, go with him two.
040	MAT	005	042	Give to him that asketh thee, and him, that would borrow of thee, turn not away.
040	MAT	005	043	Ye have heard, that it has been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy:
040	MAT	005	044	but I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them that abuse you and persecute you;
040	MAT	005	045	that ye may be the children of your heavenly Father; for He causeth his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sendeth rain upon the just and the unjust.
040	MAT	005	046	For if ye love only them that love you, what reward do ye expect? do not even the publicans the same?
040	MAT	005	047	and if ye embrace your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not the publicans so likewise?
040	MAT	005	048	Be ye therefore perfect in love and goodness, as your Father who is in heaven is perfect.
040	MAT	006	001	Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be observed by them: otherwise ye will have no reward from your Father, who is in heaven.
040	MAT	006	002	Therefore when thou dost an alms-deed, do not proclaim it abroad, as the hypocrites do, in the synagogues, and in the streets, that they may be applauded by men. Verily I tell you, they have their reward.
040	MAT	006	003	But when thou givest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doth:
040	MAT	006	004	that thine alms may be in secret, and thy Father, who seeth in secret, will himself reward thee openly.
040	MAT	006	005	And when thou prayest, be not like the hypocrites; for they love to pray in public assemblies, and in the corners of the streets, that they may be taken notice of by men. Verily I say unto you, they have their reward.
040	MAT	006	006	But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father who is in secret, and thy Father who seeth in secret, will reward thee openly.
040	MAT	006	007	But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathens do, for they think they shall be heard for their speaking much:
040	MAT	006	008	be not ye therefore like them; for your Father knoweth what ye have need of before ye ask Him.
040	MAT	006	009	After this manner therefore pray ye,
040	MAT	006	010	"Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name; thy kingdom come; thy will be done, as in heaven so also upon earth;
040	MAT	006	011	give us this day our daily bread;
040	MAT	006	012	and forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors;
040	MAT	006	013	and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one: for thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory for ever. Amen."
040	MAT	006	014	For if ye forgive men their faults, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:
040	MAT	006	015	but if ye forgive not men their transgressions, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.
040	MAT	006	016	And when ye fast, be not, like the hypocrites, of a gloomy countenance; for they disfigure their faces, that they may be observed by men to fast: I tell you, they have indeed their reward.
040	MAT	006	017	But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head and wash thy face;
040	MAT	006	018	that thou mayst not appear unto men to fast, but to thy Father who is in secret; and thy Father, who seeth in secret, will reward thee openly.
040	MAT	006	019	Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust corrupts, and where thieves break through and steal:
040	MAT	006	020	but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:
040	MAT	006	021	for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
040	MAT	006	022	The eye is the light of the body: if therefore thine eye be clear, thy whole body will be light;
040	MAT	006	023	but if thine eye be bad, thy whole body will be dark. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness!
040	MAT	006	024	No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or at lest he will be attached to the one, and neglect the other: ye cannot serve God and mammon:
040	MAT	006	025	therefore I say unto you, be not anxious for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not life more than food, and the body than raiment?
040	MAT	006	026	Look at the birds of the air; they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns: and yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are not ye preferable to them?
040	MAT	006	027	And which of you by all his thought can add one cubit to his stature?
040	MAT	006	028	And why are ye sollicitous about raiment? consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin: and yet I tell you,
040	MAT	006	029	that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.
040	MAT	006	030	Now if God so clothe the grass of the field, which is growing to-day, and to-morrow is cast into the fire, will He not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?
040	MAT	006	031	Be not therefore anxious, saying, What shall we eat, or what shall we drink, or how shall we be clothed?
040	MAT	006	032	(things which the heathens are so inquisitive after) for your heavenly Father knows that ye have need of all these.
040	MAT	006	033	But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these shall be superadded unto you.
040	MAT	006	034	Be not therefore sollicitous about the morrow; for the morrow will require thought for its own affairs: sufficient to each day is its own trouble.
040	MAT	007	001	Judge not, that ye be not judged:
040	MAT	007	002	for with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged; and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured back again to you.
040	MAT	007	003	And why dost thou look at the splinter in thy brother's eye, but takest no notice of the beam in thine own eye?
040	MAT	007	004	Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me take the chaff out of thine eye, and behold, there is a beam in thine own eye?
040	MAT	007	005	Thou hypocrite, first get the beam out of thine own eye; and then thou wilt see how to take the splinter out of thy brother's eye.
040	MAT	007	006	Give not that which is holy unto dogs, nor cast your pearls before swine; least they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you.
040	MAT	007	007	Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you:
040	MAT	007	008	for every one, that asketh, receiveth; and he, that seeketh, findeth; and to him, that knocketh, it shall be opened.
040	MAT	007	009	Is there any man among you, who, if his son ask him for bread, will give him a stone?
040	MAT	007	010	or if he ask for a fish, will he give him a serpent?
040	MAT	007	011	If ye then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give good things to them that ask Him?
040	MAT	007	012	All things therefore whatsoever ye would have men do to you, do ye also in like manner unto them: for this is the doctrine of the law and the prophets.
040	MAT	007	013	Enter ye in at the strait gate; for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be who go in thereat:
040	MAT	007	014	whereas the gate is narrow, and the way troublesome, which leadeth into life, and few there be that find it.
040	MAT	007	015	And beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheeps clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves.
040	MAT	007	016	Ye will know them by their fruits: do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?
040	MAT	007	017	so every good tree yieldeth good fruit, but a corrupt tree produces bad fruit:
040	MAT	007	018	a good tree cannot produce evil fruit, nor can a corrupt tree bear good fruit:
040	MAT	007	019	and every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire.
040	MAT	007	020	So then by their fruits ye will know them.
040	MAT	007	021	Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doth the will of my Father, who is in heaven:
040	MAT	007	022	many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name, and in thy name have cast out devils, and in thy name have wrought many miracles? and I will then declare unto them,
040	MAT	007	023	I never owned you, depart from me, ye workers of iniquity.
040	MAT	007	024	Whoever therefore heareth these words of mine, and performeth them, I will compare him to a prudent man, who built his house on a rock:
040	MAT	007	025	and the rain fell upon it, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house, and it fell not; for it was founded upon a rock.
040	MAT	007	026	And whoever heareth these words of mine, and performeth them not, shall be likened to a foolish man, who built his house upon the sand:
040	MAT	007	027	and the rain fell upon it, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house, and it fell, and the fall thereof was great.
040	MAT	007	028	And when Jesus had ended these discourses, the people were amazed at his doctrine:
040	MAT	007	029	for he taught them as one who had authority, and not as the scribes.
040	MAT	008	001	Now as he came down from the mountain, great multitudes followed Him.
040	MAT	008	002	And behold a leper came and worshipped Him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst cleanse me:
040	MAT	008	003	and Jesus stretched out his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be thou cleansed: and immediately his leprosy was cleansed.
040	MAT	008	004	And Jesus saith unto him, See thou tell no one; but go, shew thyself to the priest, and offer the gift which Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.
040	MAT	008	005	And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came unto Him a centurion beseeching Him, and saying, Lord,
040	MAT	008	006	my servant lieth in my house ill of the palsy, grievously afflicted:
040	MAT	008	007	and Jesus saith unto him, I will come and heal him.
040	MAT	008	008	But the centurion answering said, Lord, I am not worthy that Thou shouldst come under my roof, but speak the word, and my servant will be healed:
040	MAT	008	009	for I also am a man under the authority of others, yet have soldiers under me; and I say to one, go, and he goeth; and to another, come, and he cometh; and to my servant, do this, and he doth it.
040	MAT	008	010	And when Jesus heard it He marvelled, and said to them that followed Him, Verily, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith even in Israel:
040	MAT	008	011	but I tell you, that many shall come from the east and from the west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven;
040	MAT	008	012	and the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into the outer darkness; where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
040	MAT	008	013	And Jesus said to the centurion, Go, and be it unto thee as thou hast believed. And his servant was healed in that very hour.
040	MAT	008	014	And when Jesus came to Peter's house. He saw his wife's mother lying ill of a fever:
040	MAT	008	015	and He did but touch her hand, and the fever left her; and she rose up and waited on them.
040	MAT	008	016	And when it was evening they brought to him many demoniacs: and he cast out the evil spirits with a word, and healed all that were ill: that it might be fulfilled,
040	MAT	008	017	which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, He took our infirmities himself, and bore our diseases.
040	MAT	008	018	But when Jesus saw great multitudes about Him, he gave orders for departing to the other side of the lake.
040	MAT	008	019	And a certain scribe came to Him, and said, Master, I will follow Thee whithersoever Thou goest:
040	MAT	008	020	and Jesus saith unto him, The foxes have holes, and the fowls of heaven their nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.
040	MAT	008	021	But another of his disciples, whom he ordered to follow Him, said unto Him, Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father:
040	MAT	008	022	but Jesus said unto him; Do thou follow me, and let the dead bury their dead.
040	MAT	008	023	And when He was entered into the ship, his disciples followed Him:
040	MAT	008	024	and behold a great tempest rose on the sea, so that the vessel was even covered by the waves; but He was asleep.
040	MAT	008	025	And His disciples came to Him, and awoke Him, saying, Lord save us, for we are perishing: and He saith unto them,
040	MAT	008	026	Why are ye so frighted, O ye of little faith? Then He rose up and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm.
040	MAT	008	027	And the men wondered, saying, What an amazing person is this, that even the winds and the sea obey Him!
040	MAT	008	028	And when He was come to the other side, into the country of the Gergesenes, there met Him two demoniacs coming out from the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no one could pass by that way:
040	MAT	008	029	and they cried out, saying, What have we to do with Thee, Jesus thou Son of God? Art Thou come hither to torment us before the time?
040	MAT	008	030	Now there was at some distance from them a large herd of swine seeding: and the devils besought Him,
040	MAT	008	031	saying, If Thou cast us out, permit us to go away into the herd of swine:
040	MAT	008	032	and He said unto them, Go: and they came out and went away into the herd of swine; and lo, all the herd of swine ran furiously down a precipice into the sea,
040	MAT	008	033	and perished in the waters. And they that were feeding them fled, and went away into the city, and related all these things, as also concerning the demoniacs.
040	MAT	008	034	And behold, all the city came out to meet Jesus; and when they saw Him, they intreated Him to depart from their coasts.
040	MAT	009	001	And He entered into the ship and passed over, and came to his own city:
040	MAT	009	002	and behold, they brought to Him one that had the palsy laid on a couch: and Jesus seeing their faith said to the paralytic, Take heart my son, for thy sins are forgiven thee.
040	MAT	009	003	Upon which, some of the scribes said in themselves, This man blasphemeth: but Jesus knowing their surmises,
040	MAT	009	004	said to them, Why think ye evil in your hearts?
040	MAT	009	005	For which is easier? To say, thy sins be forgiven thee? or to say, rise up and walk?
040	MAT	009	006	but that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, Arise (saith He then to the paralytic) and take up thy couch, and go away to thy house.
040	MAT	009	007	And he rose up and went away to his own house.
040	MAT	009	008	But when the multitudes saw it, they were amazed, and glorified God, who had given such power to men.
040	MAT	009	009	And as Jesus was passing from thence, He saw a man sitting at the custom-house, named Matthew; and He saith to him, Follow me: and he rose up and followed Him.
040	MAT	009	010	And as He was sitting at table in the house of Matthew, behold, several publicans and notorious sinners came and sat down with Jesus and his disciples.
040	MAT	009	011	And when the Pharisees saw it, they said to his disciples, Why doth your master eat with publicans and sinners?
040	MAT	009	012	But Jesus hearing them, said unto them, They that are in health need not a physician, but they that are ill: go therefore and learn what that means,
040	MAT	009	013	"I desire mercy rather than sacrifice:" for I came not to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance.
040	MAT	009	014	Then also come to Him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the pharisees fast much, but thy disciples do not fast?
040	MAT	009	015	And Jesus said unto them, Can the friends of the bridegroom mourn, while the bridegroom is with them? but the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then they will fast.
040	MAT	009	016	As no one putteth a piece of new cloth to an old garment; for its new patch teareth away from the old garment, and the rent is made worse:
040	MAT	009	017	nor do they put new wine into old vessels; otherwise, the casks burst, and the wine is spilt, and the vessels are destroyed: but they put new wine into new vessels, and both are preserved.
040	MAT	009	018	As He was speaking these things to them, behold there came a ruler and worshipped Him, saying, My daughter is at the point of death: but come, I pray Thee, and put thy hand upon her, and she shall live:
040	MAT	009	019	and Jesus rose up, and followed him; as did also his disciples.
040	MAT	009	020	(And lo, a woman who had had a flux of blood for twelve years, came close behind Him, and touched the hem of his garment:
040	MAT	009	021	for she said within herself, If I can but touch his garment, I shall be cured.
040	MAT	009	022	And Jesus turning about, and seeing her, said, Daughter be comforted, thy faith hath cured thee. And from that time the woman was healed.)
040	MAT	009	023	And when Jesus came into the ruler's house, and saw the musicians, and the people in confusion;
040	MAT	009	024	He saith unto them, Retire; for the child is not dead, but asleep. And they laughed at Him.
040	MAT	009	025	But when the people were put out, He went in and took hold of her hand, and the damsel rose up.
040	MAT	009	026	And the fame of it spread over all the country.
040	MAT	009	027	And as Jesus was going from thence, two blind men followed Him, crying out and saying, Have compassion on us, O Son of David.
040	MAT	009	028	And when He was come into the house, the blind men came to Him: and Jesus saith unto them, Do ye believe that I am able to do this? and they say unto Him, Yes Lord.
040	MAT	009	029	Then he touched their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it done unto you: and their eyes were opened.
040	MAT	009	030	And Jesus strictly charged them, saying, Do not divulge it: but
040	MAT	009	031	they went out and spread his fame through all that country.
040	MAT	009	032	And as they were going out, there was brought to Him a dumb man, a demoniac:
040	MAT	009	033	and when the demon was cast out, the dumb man spake; and the multitudes were amazed, saying, there had never been seen the like in Israel:
040	MAT	009	034	but the pharisees said, he casts out devils by the prince of the devils.
040	MAT	009	035	Now Jesus went round to all the cities, and the villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom of heaven, and healing every disease, and every malady among the people.
040	MAT	009	036	And when He saw the multitudes, He was moved with compassion towards them; because they were dispersed and scattered like sheep that have no shepherd:
040	MAT	009	037	upon which He saith to his disciples, The harvest indeed is plentiful, but the laborers few:
040	MAT	009	038	therefore pray to the Lord of the harvest, that He would send out laborers into his harvest.
040	MAT	010	001	And He called unto Him his twelve disciples, and gave them power over impure spirits, even to cast them out; and to cure all diseases and every malady whatsoever.
040	MAT	010	002	Now these are the names of the twelve apostles: first Simon, called Peter, and Andrew his brother; Philip, and Bartholomew;
040	MAT	010	003	Thomas, and Matthew the publican; James the son of Alpheus, and Lebbeus who was surnamed Thaddeus;
040	MAT	010	004	Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, even he that betrayed Him.
040	MAT	010	005	These twelve did Jesus send forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not among the gentiles, neither enter into any city of the Samaritans:
040	MAT	010	006	but go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
040	MAT	010	007	And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand: and in confirmation of your doctrine heal the sick,
040	MAT	010	008	cleanse the leprous, raise the dead, cast out demons; and as ye have received freely, freely give.
040	MAT	010	009	Take not gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses: take no bag for your journey,
040	MAT	010	010	nor two coats, nor shoes, nor weapons; for the laborer is worthy of his food.
040	MAT	010	011	And into whatsoever city or town ye enter, inquire who in it is a worthy person, and there remain till ye leave the place.
040	MAT	010	012	And when ye come into the house, salute them:
040	MAT	010	013	and if the family be worthy, let your peace come upon it; but if they be not worthy, your salutation shall return to you.
040	MAT	010	014	And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hearken to your words; when ye come out of that house or city, shake off the very dust of your feet:
040	MAT	010	015	for I tell you verily, it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha, in the day of judgement, than for that city.
040	MAT	010	016	Behold I send you forth as sheep into the midst of wolves: be ye therefore prudent as serpents, and innocent as doves.
040	MAT	010	017	Beware of evil men; for they will deliver you up to their councils, and will scourge you in their synagogues.
040	MAT	010	018	And ye shall be brought before governors and kings on my account, for a testimony to them and to the nations:
040	MAT	010	019	but when they take you up, be not sollicitous how, or what ye shall say; for ye shall be taught in that very instant what ye shall speak: for it is not you that speak,
040	MAT	010	020	but the Spirit of your Father that speaketh by you.
040	MAT	010	021	Brother shall betray his brother to death, and the father his child: and children shall rise up against their parents, and cause them to be put to death:
040	MAT	010	022	and ye shall be hated by all men for professing my name; but he that perseveres to the end shall certainly be saved.
040	MAT	010	023	But when they persecute you in one city, flee into another: for verily I tell you, ye shall not finish your commission through the cities of Israel, before the Son of man shall come.
040	MAT	010	024	The disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above his lord:
040	MAT	010	025	it is sufficient sure for the disciple that he be treated as his master, and the servant as his lord. If then they call the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more his domestics?
040	MAT	010	026	Be not therefore afraid of them; for there is nothing hid, that shall not be revealed; nor secret, that shall not be made known.
040	MAT	010	027	What I say to you in private, declare ye in public: and what ye hear as in the ear, preach ye as from the house-tops.
040	MAT	010	028	And be not afraid of them, who can only kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear Him, who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.
040	MAT	010	029	Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and not one of them shall fall to the ground without the will of your Father:
040	MAT	010	030	and even the hairs of your head are all numbered.
040	MAT	010	031	Therefore be not afraid, ye are of more worth than many sparrows.
040	MAT	010	032	Whosoever then shall own me before men, I also will own him before my Father, who is in heaven:
040	MAT	010	033	but whosoever shall disown me before men, him will I also disown before my Father who is in heaven.
040	MAT	010	034	Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to bring peace but division.
040	MAT	010	035	For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law:
040	MAT	010	036	and those of a man's own family shall be his enemies.
040	MAT	010	037	He that loveth father or mother more than me, is not worthy of me; and he that loveth son or daughter more than me, is not worthy of me:
040	MAT	010	038	and he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me.
040	MAT	010	039	He that would save his life shall lose it; and he, that loseth his life for my sake, shall find it.
040	MAT	010	040	He that receiveth you, receiveth me: and he that receiveth me, receiveth Him that sent me.
040	MAT	010	041	He that receiveth a prophet as a prophet, shall have a prophet's reward: and he that receiveth a righteous man as such, shall receive a righteous man's reward.
040	MAT	010	042	And whosoever shall give to one of these mean persons but a cup of cold water to drink, as my disciple, I assure you, he shall not lose his reward.
040	MAT	011	001	And when Jesus had made an end of giving orders to his twelve disciples, He departed from thence to teach and preach in their cities.
040	MAT	011	002	Now when John heard in prison of the works of Christ,
040	MAT	011	003	he sent two of his disciples to ask Him, Art thou He who was to come, or are we to expect another?
040	MAT	011	004	And Jesus said to them in answer, Go and tell John the things which ye hear and see:
040	MAT	011	005	the blind are restored to sight, and the lame walk; the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear; the dead are raised to life, and the poor have the gospel preached to them:
040	MAT	011	006	and happy is the man who shall not be offended at any thing in me.
040	MAT	011	007	And as they departed, Jesus took occasion to say to the people concerning John, What went ye out into the desert to see? a reed shaken by the wind?
040	MAT	011	008	But what went ye out to see? a man clad in fine attire? they that wear rich clothes are in the palaces of kings.
040	MAT	011	009	But what did ye indeed go out to see? a prophet? Yes, verily, and one superior to a prophet.
040	MAT	011	010	For this is he, of whom it is written, "Behold I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee."
040	MAT	011	011	For I assure you that in the whole human race there hath not risen a greater than John the baptist: though the lest in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he:
040	MAT	011	012	and from the days of John the baptist to this time, the kingdom of heaven is as it were forced into, and the most pressing seize upon it with eagerness.
040	MAT	011	013	For all the prophets, and the law, did no more than prophesy, till John came:
040	MAT	011	014	and, if ye are willing to receive the truth, This is that Elias who was to come.
040	MAT	011	015	He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
040	MAT	011	016	But to what shall I compare this generation? they are like children sitting in the market-places,
040	MAT	011	017	and calling to their companions, and saying "We have sung and ye have not danced; we have mourned, and ye have not lamented:"
040	MAT	011	018	for John came neither eating nor drinking as others do, and they say, He is beside himself:
040	MAT	011	019	the Son of man came eating and drinking like other men, and they call Him a gluttonous man, and a wine-bibber, and a friend of publicans and sinners. But wisdom is justified by her children.
040	MAT	011	020	Then began He to upbraid the cities, in which most of his miracles were wrought; because they did not repent.
040	MAT	011	021	Wo unto thee, Chorazin; wo unto thee, Bethsaida: for if the miracles wrought among you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes:
040	MAT	011	022	therefore I tell you, it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgement, than for you.
040	MAT	011	023	And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted even to heaven, shalt be cast down to hell: for if the miracles, which have been wrought in thee, had been wrought in Sodom, it would have remained unto this day.
040	MAT	011	024	Moreover I tell you, that it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgement, than for thee.
040	MAT	011	025	And upon this occasion Jesus opened his mouth and said, "I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and knowing, and hast revealed them to babes:
040	MAT	011	026	even so, Father, for it was thy good pleasure that so it should be."
040	MAT	011	027	All things are delivered to me by my Father: and no one knoweth the Son, but the Father; nor does any one know the Father, but the Son, and he to whom the Son is pleased to reveal Him.
040	MAT	011	028	Come unto me therefore all ye who are labouring and oppressed, and I will give you ease.
040	MAT	011	029	Take but my yoke upon you, and learn of me, (for I am meek and lowly in heart,) and ye shall find refreshment to your souls:
040	MAT	011	030	for my yoke is easy, and my burthen is light.
040	MAT	012	001	About this time as Jesus passed through the cornfields on the sabbath-day, his disciples being hungry began to pluck the ears of corn, and to eat them.
040	MAT	012	002	And when the pharisees saw it they said to Him, See, thy disciples are doing what is not lawful for them to do on the sabbath.
040	MAT	012	003	But He replied, Have ye not read what David did, when he, and his attendants, were hungry? how he went into the house of God,
040	MAT	012	004	and did eat the shew-bread, which it was not lawful for him to eat, nor those that were with him; but for the priests only? or have ye not read in the law,
040	MAT	012	005	what profane sort of work the priests do in the temple on the sabbath-days, and yet are blameless?
040	MAT	012	006	But I tell you, that a greater than the temple is here:
040	MAT	012	007	and if ye had known what that scripture means, "I desire mercy rather than sacrifice," ye would not have condemned the guiltless.
040	MAT	012	008	For the Son of man is lord even of the sabbath.
040	MAT	012	009	And he went away and came into their synagogue: and there being a man there who had a withered hand,
040	MAT	012	010	they asked Him, if it were lawful to heal on the sabbath-days? that they might accuse Him.
040	MAT	012	011	But He said unto them, What man of you shall have one of his sheep fall into a pit on the sabbath-day, and will not lay hold of it and lift it out?
040	MAT	012	012	And of how much more worth is a man than a sheep? Sure then it is lawful to do good on the sabbath-days.
040	MAT	012	013	Then saith He to the man, Stretch out thine hand: and he stretched it out, and it was made sound like the other.
040	MAT	012	014	But the pharisees went out of the synagogue and took counsel together against Him, how they might destroy Him:
040	MAT	012	015	but Jesus knew it, and withdrew from thence; and great multitudes followed Him with their sick,
040	MAT	012	016	and he healed them all, charging them not to make Him known:
040	MAT	012	017	that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Behold my servant whom I have chosen,
040	MAT	012	018	my beloved in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit upon Him, and He shall declare judgement to the nations: He shall not contend,
040	MAT	012	019	nor cry aloud, nor shall any one hear his voice in the streets:
040	MAT	012	020	a bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax he will not extinguish, till He send forth judgement victorious.
040	MAT	012	021	And in his name shall the Gentiles hope.
040	MAT	012	022	Then was brought to Him a demoniac, who was blind and dumb; and he healed Him, so that the blind and dumb man both spake and saw:
040	MAT	012	023	and all the multitudes were amazed, and said, "Is not this the Son of David?"
040	MAT	012	024	which the pharisees hearing, said, "He only casts out demons by the help of Beelzebub the prince of the devils."
040	MAT	012	025	But Jesus, who well knew their thoughts, said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself becomes desolate; and no city, or family, divided against itself can stand:
040	MAT	012	026	if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself; how then shall his kingdom stand?
040	MAT	012	027	And if I cast out demons by the power of Beelzebub, by whom do your own people cast them out? wherefore they shall be your judges:
040	MAT	012	028	but if I by the Spirit of God cast out devils, then certainly the kingdom of God is come unto you.
040	MAT	012	029	Or, how can any one enter into the house of a strong man, and take away his goods, unless he first overpower the strong man? and then indeed he may strip his house.
040	MAT	012	030	He that is not with me, is against me; and he that gathereth not with me, scattereth.
040	MAT	012	031	Wherefore, I tell you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven to men; but the blasphemy against the holy Spirit shall not be forgiven them:
040	MAT	012	032	and if any one speak against the Son of man, it may be forgiven him: but if any one speak against the holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this life, nor in that to come.
040	MAT	012	033	Either allow the tree to be good, and it's fruit good; or shew the tree to be corrupt, and it's fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by it's fruit.
040	MAT	012	034	O race of vipers, how can ye speak good things, who are yourselves so wicked? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.
040	MAT	012	035	A good man out of the good treasure of the heart produceth good things; and a wicked man out of the wicked treasure uttereth wicked things:
040	MAT	012	036	but I tell you, that of every idle word, which men shall speak, they shall give an account in the day of judgement; for by thy words thou shalt be justified,
040	MAT	012	037	and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.
040	MAT	012	038	Then some of the scribes and pharisees answered Him, saying, Master, we should be glad to see a sign from thee:
040	MAT	012	039	but He replied and said unto them, This wicked and degenerate race demand a sign; but no sign shall be given them, except that of the prophet Jonah:
040	MAT	012	040	for as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly, so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
040	MAT	012	041	So that the men of Nineveh will rise up in the judgement against this generation, and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold a greater than Jonas is here.
040	MAT	012	042	The queen of the South too, shall rise up in the day of judgement against this generation, and condemn it; for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold a greater than Solomon is here.
040	MAT	012	043	Now when an impure spirit is gone out of a man, he wanders through dry desert places, seeking rest, and findeth none:
040	MAT	012	044	then saith he, I will return into my house, that I came out of; and when he cometh, he findeth it empty, swept, and set off to advantage:
040	MAT	012	045	then he goeth and taketh with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there; and so the last state of that man is worse than the first. And thus shall it be to this wicked generation.
040	MAT	012	046	Now as He was yet discoursing to the people, behold, his mother and his brethren stood without, and desired to speak to Him:
040	MAT	012	047	and somebody said to Him, "Here are thy mother and thy brethren standing without, desiring to speak to thee."
040	MAT	012	048	But in answer to him that told Him, He said, "Who is my mother, and who are my brethren?"
040	MAT	012	049	and stretching out his hand towards his disciples, He said, "Behold my mother and my brethren:"
040	MAT	012	050	for whosoever doth the will of my Father who is in heaven, he is to me as my brother and sister and mother.
040	MAT	013	001	Now on the same day, Jesus went out of the house, and sat by the sea-side:
040	MAT	013	002	and many people were gathered together to bear Him, so that He went into a ship and sat down, and all the multitude stood upon the shore; and He spake to them many things in parables,
040	MAT	013	003	saying, "Behold a sower went out to sow;
040	MAT	013	004	and as he was sowing, some seeds fell by the way-side, and the birds came and ate them up:
040	MAT	013	005	some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth; and they soon sprung up indeed, because they had no depth of earth;
040	MAT	013	006	but when the sun rose, they were burnt up, and withered; because they had no root:
040	MAT	013	007	and others fell among thorns; and the thorns grew up and choked them:
040	MAT	013	008	but others fell on good ground, and yielded fruit, some an hundred-fold, some sixty, and some thirty.
040	MAT	013	009	He that hath ears to hear, let him hear."
040	MAT	013	010	And the disciples came to Him and said, Why dost thou speak to them in parables?
040	MAT	013	011	And He answered them, saying, Because it is granted unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not granted:
040	MAT	013	012	for whosoever really hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have abundantly; but whosoever thus hath not, even that which he hath, shall be taken away from him:
040	MAT	013	013	for this reason I speak to them in parables; because though they see, they will not see; and though they hear, they will not hear, nor understand.
040	MAT	013	014	And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah, which saith, Ye shall hear by the hearing of the ear, and not understand; and in seeing ye shall see, and not perceive: for the heart of this people is grown stupid,
040	MAT	013	015	and their ears are dull of hearing, and they have closed their eyes; least they should see at all with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.
040	MAT	013	016	But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear:
040	MAT	013	017	for indeed I tell you, that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see the things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear what ye hear, and have not heard them.
040	MAT	013	018	Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower. When any one heareth the word of the gospel-kingdom,
040	MAT	013	019	and regardeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and snatcheth away that which was sown in his heart: this is he who received the seed as by the way-side.
040	MAT	013	020	And he who received the seed as upon stony grounds, is one that heareth the word and immediately receiveth it with joy:
040	MAT	013	021	yet hath he no root in himself, and therefore is but for a short season; and when affliction cometh, or persecution on account of the word, he is as soon disgusted.
040	MAT	013	022	And he that received the seed among the thorns, is one that likewise heareth the word; but the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches choketh the word, and so it becometh unfruitful.
040	MAT	013	023	But he who received the seed into good ground, is one that heareth and understandeth the word, who indeed beareth fruit, and yieldeth, like fertile lands, some an hundred-fold, some sixty, some thirty.
040	MAT	013	024	Another parable propounded He unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like a man, who sowed good grain in his ground:
040	MAT	013	025	but while men were asleep, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went away.
040	MAT	013	026	Now when the blade shot forth, and produced the corn, then the tares also appeared.
040	MAT	013	027	So the servants came to their master, and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? whence then are the tares?
040	MAT	013	028	And he said unto them, Some enemy hath done this. The servants therefore said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?
040	MAT	013	029	But he said, No: least in plucking up the tares ye root up the corn along with them.
040	MAT	013	030	Let both grow together till harvest, and in the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, First gather the weeds together, and bind them in bundles to burn them; but carry the wheat into my barn.
040	MAT	013	031	Another parable delivered He unto them, saying, The gospel-kingdom is like a grain of mustard-seed, which a man took and sowed in his field.
040	MAT	013	032	Which is indeed one of the lest of all seeds: but when it is grown, is the greatest among herbs, and even becometh a tree; so that the birds of the air come and lodge in it's branches.
040	MAT	013	033	Another parable spake He unto them, saying, The gospel-kingdom is like leaven, which a woman took and put into a large quantity of dough, till the whole was leavened.
040	MAT	013	034	All these things spake Jesus in parables to the multitudes; and at this time He spake nothing to them without a parable:
040	MAT	013	035	that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables, I will publish things which have been concealed from the foundation of the world.
040	MAT	013	036	Then Jesus leaving the multitude went into the house; and his disciples came to Him, saying, Explain to us the parable of the tares of the field:
040	MAT	013	037	and He answered them, and said, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;
040	MAT	013	038	the field is the world; the good seed are the children of my kingdom; and the tares are the children of the wicked one.
040	MAT	013	039	The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.
040	MAT	013	040	As therefore the tares are gathered together, and burnt in the fire; so shall it be in the end of the world:
040	MAT	013	041	the Son of man will send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all that commit offences, and those who do iniquity, and shall cast them into the furnace of fire,
040	MAT	013	042	and there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.
040	MAT	013	043	But the righteous shall then shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
040	MAT	013	044	Again, the kingdom of heaven is like treasure hid in a field, which a man having found conceals, and being rejoiced at it goes and sells all that he has, and purchases that field.
040	MAT	013	045	Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant seeking precious pearls,
040	MAT	013	046	who, having found one of great value, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.
040	MAT	013	047	Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net, that was cast into the sea, and inclosed fishes of various sorts;
040	MAT	013	048	which, when it was full, they dragged to the shore, and sat down and gathered the good into vessels, and threw out the bad.
040	MAT	013	049	So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and separate the wicked from among the righteous;
040	MAT	013	050	and shall cast them into the fiery furnace, and there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.
040	MAT	013	051	Then saith Jesus unto them, Did ye understand all these? they say unto Him, Yes, Lord: and He said unto them,
040	MAT	013	052	Therefore every teacher, who has been thus instructed in the knowledge of the kingdom of heaven, is like a master of a family, who brings forth out of his store things new and old.
040	MAT	013	053	And when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence:
040	MAT	013	054	and came into his own country, and taught them in their synagogues; so that they were amazed and said, Whence hath this man this wisdom and these powers?
040	MAT	013	055	Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?
040	MAT	013	056	and his sisters, are they not all here among us? from whence then hath this man all these things?
040	MAT	013	057	So they were prejudiced against Him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is no where less honoured than in his own country, and in his own family.
040	MAT	013	058	And he did not many miracles there, because of their unbelief.
040	MAT	014	001	At that time Herod the tetrarch heard the fame of Jesus,
040	MAT	014	002	and said to his servants, This is John the baptist, he is certainly risen from the dead, and therefore miraculous things are done by him:
040	MAT	014	003	for Herod had apprehended John, and bound him, and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife;
040	MAT	014	004	for John said to Him, It is not lawful for thee to have her: and he would have put him to death,
040	MAT	014	005	but that he was afraid of the people; for they esteemed him as a prophet.
040	MAT	014	006	But when Herod's birth-day was kept, the daughter of Herodias danced before them, and pleased Herod, so
040	MAT	014	007	that he promised her with an oath to give her whatever she would ask:
040	MAT	014	008	and she, being before instructed by her mother, said, Give me here in a dish the head of John the baptist:
040	MAT	014	009	at which the king was distressed, but because of his oath, and of those who sat at table with him, he ordered it to be given her;
040	MAT	014	010	and he sent and beheaded John in the prison,
040	MAT	014	011	and his head was brought in a dish, and given to the young princess, who carried it to her mother:
040	MAT	014	012	and his disciples came and took up the body and buried it, and then went and told Jesus.
040	MAT	014	013	And when Jesus heard it, He departed from thence in a ship to a solitary place of retirement: but the people hearing where He was followed Him on foot from the cities:
040	MAT	014	014	and when Jesus came out of the ship, He saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion toward them; and He healed their sick.
040	MAT	014	015	Now when it was evening his disciples came to Him and said, This is a desert place, and meal-time is now past; dismiss the people, that they may go away to the towns, and buy themselves victuals.
040	MAT	014	016	But Jesus said to them, they have no need to go away, do ye give them something to eat.
040	MAT	014	017	And they said, we have nothing here but five loaves and two fishes:
040	MAT	014	018	and He said, bring them hither to me.
040	MAT	014	019	And having ordered the multitudes to sit down upon the grass, and taken the five loaves and the two fishes, He looked up to heaven and blessed them; and He brake the loaves and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples to the people: and they did all eat, and were satisfied;
040	MAT	014	020	and they took up what was left even of fragments twelve baskets full.
040	MAT	014	021	Now they that had eaten were about five thousand men, besides women and children.
040	MAT	014	022	And presently after Jesus obliged the disciples to get into the ship, and to go before Him to the other side, while He dismissed the multitudes:
040	MAT	014	023	and when He had dismissed them, He went up to a hill in private to pray.
040	MAT	014	024	And in the evening He was there alone. Now the ship was by this time in the midst of the sea, and violently tossed by the waves; for the wind was contrary:
040	MAT	014	025	but in the fourth watch of the night Jesus came to them walking on the sea:
040	MAT	014	026	and when the disciples saw Him walking on the sea, they were affrighted and said, It is an apparition;
040	MAT	014	027	and they cried out for fear: but Jesus immediately spake to them, saying, Take courage, it is I, be not afraid.
040	MAT	014	028	Then Peter answered Him and said, Lord, if it be thou, command me to come unto thee upon the waters.
040	MAT	014	029	And He said, Come.
040	MAT	014	030	And Peter went down from the ship and walked upon the waters to go to Jesus: but seeing the wind boisterous, he was afraid, and beginning to sink cried out, Lord, save me.
040	MAT	014	031	And Jesus, immediately stretching forth his hand, laid hold of him, and saith to him, O man of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?
040	MAT	014	032	So they got into the ship, and the wind ceased.
040	MAT	014	033	Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped Him, saying, Thou art indeed the Son of God.
040	MAT	014	034	And they passed over and came into the country of Gennesaret.
040	MAT	014	035	And the men of that place getting knowledge of Him, sent into all that country about; and they brought to Him all that were ill;
040	MAT	014	036	and intreated Him that they might but touch the border of his garment; and as many as touched Him were made perfectly well.
040	MAT	015	001	Then came to Jesus the scribes and pharisees from Jerusalem saying,
040	MAT	015	002	Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat.
040	MAT	015	003	But He answered and said unto them, And why do ye transgress the commandment of God for your tradition?
040	MAT	015	004	For God commanded saying, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, He that revileth father or mother, let him be put to death:
040	MAT	015	005	but ye say, If any man say to his father or mother, "that which thou mightest be profited by from me is a gift to the temple,"
040	MAT	015	006	and so honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free. And thus have ye made void the commandment of God by your tradition.
040	MAT	015	007	Well did Esaias prophecy concerning you,
040	MAT	015	008	saying, This people approach me with their mouth, and honour me with their lips, but their heart is far from me:
040	MAT	015	009	but in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the injunctions of men.
040	MAT	015	010	And He called the multitude to Him, and said unto them, Hear and understand it:
040	MAT	015	011	not that which goeth into the mouth defileth the man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this polluteth the man.
040	MAT	015	012	Whereupon his disciples came and said to Him, Dost thou know that the pharisees, when they heard this assertion, were offended at it?
040	MAT	015	013	But He answered and said, Every plantation which my heavenly Father hath not planted shall be rooted up.
040	MAT	015	014	Regard them not; for they are blind guides of the blind: and if the blind lead the blind, both will fall into the ditch.
040	MAT	015	015	Then Peter answered, and said unto Him, Explain to us this parable.
040	MAT	015	016	And Jesus replied, Are ye also still void of understanding?
040	MAT	015	017	Do ye not yet know, that whatever goeth into the mouth passeth to the belly and is discharged downwards?
040	MAT	015	018	But the things, which proceed out of the mouth, come from the heart, and those defile a man.
040	MAT	015	019	For out of the heart proceed wicked disputings, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false-witnessings, slanders:
040	MAT	015	020	these defile a man, but to eat without washing the hands doth not defile him.
040	MAT	015	021	And Jesus went from thence, and retired into the parts adjacent to Tyre and Sidon.
040	MAT	015	022	And there came out of those quarters a Canaanitish woman, and cried to Him saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David; for my daughter is grievously tormented by a demon.
040	MAT	015	023	But he answered her not a word: and his disciples came and intreated Him, saying, Send her away, for she crieth importunately after us.
040	MAT	015	024	But he answered and said, I am sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
040	MAT	015	025	However, she came and worshipped Him, saying, Lord help me.
040	MAT	015	026	But he answered, It is not fit to take the children's bread and throw it to dogs: and she said, True, Lord;
040	MAT	015	027	yet the dogs eat of the crumbs that fall from the table of their masters.
040	MAT	015	028	Then Jesus answering, said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it therefore unto thee as thou desirest. And her daughter was cured from that very hour.
040	MAT	015	029	And Jesus departed from thence, and came near to the sea of Galilee; and going up to a mountain He sat down there.
040	MAT	015	030	And great multitudes came to Him, having with them those that were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others; and laid them at the feet of Jesus, and He healed them.
040	MAT	015	031	So that the people wondered when they saw the dumb speaking, the maimed become sound, the lame walking, and the blind seeing: and they glorified the God of Israel.
040	MAT	015	032	Then Jesus called his disciples to Him and said, I am moved with compassion to the multitude, for they have been with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: I will not let them go away fasting, least they faint in the way.
040	MAT	015	033	And his disciples replied, Whence can we have so much bread in this desert place as to satisfy so great a multitude?
040	MAT	015	034	And Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? and they said, Seven, and a few small fishes.
040	MAT	015	035	Then He bid the people sit down on the ground;
040	MAT	015	036	and taking the seven loaves and the fishes, when He had given thanks, He brake them, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.
040	MAT	015	037	And they did all eat, and were satisfied: and they took up what was left even of fragments seven baskets full.
040	MAT	015	038	Now they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and children.
040	MAT	015	039	Then he dismissed the multitudes, and went into a ship, and came to the coasts of Magdala.
040	MAT	016	001	And the pharisees and sadducees came to Him, and captiously asked Him to shew them a sign from heaven.
040	MAT	016	002	But He answered them, In the evening ye say, It will be fair weather, for the sky is red:
040	MAT	016	003	and in the morning, It will be foul weather to-day, for the sky is red and lowring. Ye hypocrites, can ye distinguish the appearance of the sky, and not discern the signs of these times?
040	MAT	016	004	This wicked and degenerate race demand a sign; but no sign shall be given them, except that of the prophet Jonah. And so He left them and went away.
040	MAT	016	005	Now when his disciples departed to the other side, they forgot to take bread with them:
040	MAT	016	006	and therefore when Jesus said to them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the pharisees and of the sadducees,
040	MAT	016	007	they said one to another, It is because we have taken no bread.
040	MAT	016	008	And Jesus knowing their thoughts said to them, O ye of little faith, why do ye argue among yourselves, because ye have brought no bread?
040	MAT	016	009	Do ye not yet understand, nor remember the five loaves divided among five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?
040	MAT	016	010	nor the seven loaves among four thousand, and how many baskets-full ye took away?
040	MAT	016	011	How is it then that ye do not understand that I did not speak to you concerning bread, when I bid you to beware of the leaven of the pharisees and of the sadducees?
040	MAT	016	012	Then they understood, that He did not bid them beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the pharisees and of the sadducees.
040	MAT	016	013	And when Jesus came into the parts of Cesarea Philippi, He asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I, the Son of man, am?
040	MAT	016	014	And they answered, Some say thou art John the Baptist, others Elias, and others Jeremias, or one of the prophets.
040	MAT	016	015	But, saith He unto them, whom do ye say that I am?
040	MAT	016	016	And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ the Son of the living God.
040	MAT	016	017	And Jesus replied and said unto him, Blessed art thou Simon son of Jonas, for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father who is in heaven.
040	MAT	016	018	And I also say unto thee, as thou art called Peter, so upon this rock, which thou hast confessed, will I build my church, and the gates of death shall not prevail against it.
040	MAT	016	019	And I will give thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.
040	MAT	016	020	Then charged He his disciples that they should tell no one that He was the Messiah.
040	MAT	016	021	And from that time began Jesus to acquaint his disciples, that He must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders, and chief priests, and scribes; and be put to death, and be raised again on the third day.
040	MAT	016	022	Then Peter took Him and began to expostulate with Him, saying, Be it far from thee, Lord: may this never be unto thee.
040	MAT	016	023	But He turned and said unto Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan, thou art an offence to me; for thou regardest not the things of God, but those that be of men.
040	MAT	016	024	Then said Jesus to his disciples, If any one is willing to come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me:
040	MAT	016	025	for he that would save his life shall lose it; but he that would lose his life for my sake shall find it.
040	MAT	016	026	For what is a man profited, if he gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give as a ransom for his soul?
040	MAT	016	027	For the Son of man will come in the glory of his father, with his angels, and then he will recompense every one according to his practice.
040	MAT	016	028	And I tell you of a truth, there be some of those standing here, who shall not taste of death, till they have seen the Son of man coming in his kingdom.
040	MAT	017	001	And after six days, Jesus taketh Peter, and James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up to a high mountain apart;
040	MAT	017	002	and was transfigured before them: and his face shone like the sun, and his raiment became white as the light.
040	MAT	017	003	And they saw Moses and Elias talking with Him.
040	MAT	017	004	Then Peter said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou pleasest, let us make three tabernacles here, one for Thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.
040	MAT	017	005	And as he was speaking, lo a bright cloud overshadowed them, and a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye Him.
040	MAT	017	006	And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and were sore afraid.
040	MAT	017	007	But Jesus came and touched them and said, Rise up and be not afraid.
040	MAT	017	008	And when they lifted up their eyes, they saw none but Jesus only.
040	MAT	017	009	And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, Tell the vision to no one, till the Son of man be risen from the dead.
040	MAT	017	010	And his disciples asked Him, saying, Why then do the scribes say, that Elias must first come?
040	MAT	017	011	Jesus said unto them, Elias doth indeed come first, and shall set all things right.
040	MAT	017	012	But I tell you that Elias is come already, and they knew him not, but did what they pleased to him: and so is the Son of man to suffer by them.
040	MAT	017	013	Then the disciples understood that He spake to them of John the baptist.
040	MAT	017	014	And when they were come to the multitude, there came to Him a man kneeling down and saying,
040	MAT	017	015	Lord, have compassion upon my son, for he is lunatic and grievously afflicted; for he often falleth into the fire, and often into the water.
040	MAT	017	016	And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not heal him.
040	MAT	017	017	Then Jesus answered and said, O unbelieving and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I bear with you?
040	MAT	017	018	Bring him here to me. And when Jesus rebuked him, the demon departed out of him, and the child was cured from that time.
040	MAT	017	019	Then came the disciples to Jesus in private, and said, Why could not we cast him out?
040	MAT	017	020	And Jesus said unto them, because of your unbelief: for verily I tell you, if ye had but faith as a grain of mustard-seed, ye might say to this mountain, Remove from hence thither, and it shall remove: and nothing would be impossible to you.
040	MAT	017	021	But this kind is not to be cast out but by prayer and fasting.
040	MAT	017	022	And while they were in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, the Son of man is to be delivered into the hands of men:
040	MAT	017	023	and they will put Him to death, and the third day He shall be raised again. And they were exceedingly grieved.
040	MAT	017	024	And when they were come to Capernaum, the receivers of the tribute-money came to Peter and said, Doth not your master pay tribute? Yes, saith he.
040	MAT	017	025	And when he came into the house, Jesus prevented him and said, What thinkest thou, Simon? Of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? Of their own children, or of other people?
040	MAT	017	026	Peter saith unto Him, Of others. Jesus answered him, Then are the children free:
040	MAT	017	027	but that we may not give them offence, go to the sea-side and throw in a hook, and take the first fish that comes up, and open its mouth, and thou shalt find a piece of money: that take and give them for me and thee.
040	MAT	018	001	At that time came the disciples to Jesus, saying, Who is to be the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?
040	MAT	018	002	And Jesus calling to Him a little child, set it in the midst of them,
040	MAT	018	003	and said, Verily I declare unto you, unless ye be converted, and become like little children, ye shall never enter into the kingdom of heaven.
040	MAT	018	004	Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, he shall be greatest in the kingdom of heaven:
040	MAT	018	005	and whoever shall receive one such little child for my sake, receiveth me:
040	MAT	018	006	but whosoever shall lay a stumbling-block in the way of one of these little ones, who believe in me, it were better for him that a milstone were hung on his neck, and that he were thrown into the sea.
040	MAT	018	007	Wo will be to the world from such offenses; for it is of necessity that offenses come: but wo to that man by whom the offense cometh.
040	MAT	018	008	If then thy hand or thy foot cause thee to offend, cut them off and cast them from thee; it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire:
040	MAT	018	009	and if thine eye cause thee to offend, pluck it out and cast it from thee; it is better for thee to enter into life with but one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell-fire.
040	MAT	018	010	See that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I tell you, that their angels in heaven do continually appear in the presence of my father, who is in heaven:
040	MAT	018	011	for the Son of man came from thence to save that which was lost.
040	MAT	018	012	What think ye? if any man had an hundred sheep, and one of them should go astray, would he not leave the ninety and nine, and go upon the hills, and seek that which is gone astray?
040	MAT	018	013	And if he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth more on account of that, than of the ninety nine which went not astray.
040	MAT	018	014	Even so it is not the will of your heavenly Father, that any one of these little ones should be lost.
040	MAT	018	015	And if thy brother trespass against thee, go and expostulate with him alone; if he hearken to thee, thou hast gained thy brother:
040	MAT	018	016	but if he regard thee not, take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.
040	MAT	018	017	And if he disregard them, tell it to the church: but if he disregard the church too, let him be unto thee as an heathen and a publican.
040	MAT	018	018	Verily I say unto you, whatsoever ye shall bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven.
040	MAT	018	019	And I tell you moreover, that if but two of you shall agree on earth concerning any thing which they would ask for, it shall be granted them by my Father who is in heaven:
040	MAT	018	020	for where two or three are assembled together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.
040	MAT	018	021	Then Peter came to Him and said, Lord, how often shall my brother offend against me, and I forgive him? to seven times?
040	MAT	018	022	Jesus answereth him, I tell thee not, to seven times, but to seventy times seven.
040	MAT	018	023	And therefore the gospel-kingdom is like unto a king, who had a mind to settle accounts with his servants:
040	MAT	018	024	and when he began to reckon, there was brought to him one, who was debtor in ten thousand talents:
040	MAT	018	025	and not having it to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife and children and all that he had; and payment to be made.
040	MAT	018	026	The servant therefore fell prostrate before him, saying, Lord, bear with me a while, and I will pay thee all:
040	MAT	018	027	and his lord had compassion on him, and discharged him, and forgave him the debt.
040	MAT	018	028	But that same servant, as he was going out, met with one of his fellow-servants, who owed him but an hundred pence; and he laid hold on him and seized him by the throat, saying, Pay me what thou owest me:
040	MAT	018	029	and his fellow-servant fell down at his feet, and intreated him, saying, Bear with me a while, and I will pay thee all.
040	MAT	018	030	And he would not: but went away and threw him into prison till he should pay the debt.
040	MAT	018	031	Now when his fellow-servants saw what was done, they were very much grieved, and came and acquainted their lord with all that had passed.
040	MAT	018	032	Then his lord called for him again, and said to him, Thou wicked slave, I forgave thee all that vast debt at thy request,
040	MAT	018	033	and oughtest not thou to have had compassion on thy fellow-servant, even as I had on thee?
040	MAT	018	034	And his lord being highly provoked delivered him to the officers, till he should pay all that was owing to him.
040	MAT	018	035	Thus will my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye forgive not every one his brother from your hearts their trespasses.
040	MAT	019	001	And when Jesus had finished these discourses, He departed from Galilee, and came into the borders of Judea, beyond Jordan:
040	MAT	019	002	and great multitudes followed Him, and there He healed them.
040	MAT	019	003	And the pharisees came to Him to ensnare Him, and asked Him, whether it was lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?
040	MAT	019	004	And He answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that He, who made them at first, made them male and female, and said, For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother,
040	MAT	019	005	and be joined to his wife, and they two shall be one flesh:
040	MAT	019	006	so that they are no longer two, but one flesh. And therefore what God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.
040	MAT	019	007	They say unto Him, Why then did Moses order a bill of divorce to be given, and so to put her away?
040	MAT	019	008	He answered them, Moses because of your hardheartedness, permitted you to put away your wives; but it was not so from the beginning:
040	MAT	019	009	and I tell you, that whosoever putteth away his wife, except for whoredom, and marrieth another, committeth adultery; and he that marrieth her so put away committeth adultery.
040	MAT	019	010	His disciples say unto Him, if the case of a man with his wife be thus, it is not adviseable to marry:
040	MAT	019	011	but He said unto them, All men cannot receive this saying of yours, but those only who have the gift of continence:
040	MAT	019	012	for there are some eunuchs, who were born so from their mother's womb; and there be some, who were made eunuchs by men; and there are eunuchs, who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. He that can receive this saying, let him receive it.
040	MAT	019	013	Then were brought to Him little children, that He might put his hands upon them, and bless them: and the disciples rebuked them;
040	MAT	019	014	but Jesus said, Suffer the children to come to me, and do not hinder them: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.
040	MAT	019	015	And when He had laid his hands on them, he departed thence.
040	MAT	019	016	And behold, there came one to Him, and said, Good master, what good shall I do, that I may have eternal life?
040	MAT	019	017	And He said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God: but if thou desirest to enter into life, keep the commandments.
040	MAT	019	018	He saith unto Him, Which? And Jesus answered, Thou shalt do no murther, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Honour thy father and mother;
040	MAT	019	019	and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy self.
040	MAT	019	020	The young man saith unto Him, All these have I kept from my youth: wherein am I yet deficient?
040	MAT	019	021	Jesus replied, If thou wouldst be perfect, go, sell thy estate, and give it to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come and follow me.
040	MAT	019	022	But when the young man heard that, he went away sorrowful; for he had large possessions.
040	MAT	019	023	Then said Jesus to his disciples, Verily I tell you, that a rich man shall with difficulty enter into the kingdom of heaven:
040	MAT	019	024	and again I tell you, It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
040	MAT	019	025	His disciples, when they heard this, were exceedingly struck, and said, Who then can be saved?
040	MAT	019	026	But Jesus looking upon them said unto them, With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.
040	MAT	019	027	Then Peter replied and said unto Him, Behold we have quitted all and have followed thee; what then shall we have?
040	MAT	019	028	And Jesus said unto them, Verily I tell you, that ye who have followed me, in the regeneration, when the son of man shall sit on the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon the twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel:
040	MAT	019	029	yea and every one who hath left houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, shall receive an hundred-fold, and shall inherit eternal life.
040	MAT	019	030	But many that are first shall be last, and the last first.
040	MAT	020	001	For the gospel-kingdom is like the master of a family, who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard:
040	MAT	020	002	and agreeing with the men for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard:
040	MAT	020	003	and going out about the third hour he saw others standing in the market-place doing nothing,
040	MAT	020	004	and said to them, Go ye also into the vineyard, and what is reasonable I will give you: so they went.
040	MAT	020	005	And going out again about the sixth and ninth hour he did in like manner.
040	MAT	020	006	And going out about the eleventh hour, he found others standing without work, and saith to them, Why stand ye here all the day doing nothing?
040	MAT	020	007	They say unto him, because no one hath hired us. He saith unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatever is reasonable ye shall receive.
040	MAT	020	008	Now when evening was come, the owner of the vineyard saith to his steward, Call the work-men and pay them their hire, beginning from the last even to the first.
040	MAT	020	009	And when those came who were hired about the eleventh hour, they received every one a penny:
040	MAT	020	010	but when the first came, they thought that they should receive more; and they also received every one a penny.
040	MAT	020	011	And after they had received it they murmured against the master of the house,
040	MAT	020	012	saying, These last have worked but one hour, and thou hast made them equal to us, who have borne the burthen and heat of the day.
040	MAT	020	013	But he answered, and said to one of them, Friend, I do thee no wrong; didst not thou agree with me for a penny?
040	MAT	020	014	Take what is thine, and be gone: it is my pleasure to give to this last as I do to thee;
040	MAT	020	015	and may I not do what I will with my own?
040	MAT	020	016	Is thine eye evil because I am good? Thus the last shall be first, and the first last; for there are many called, but few chosen.
040	MAT	020	017	And as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, He took the twelve disciples apart in the way, and said unto them, Behold we are going up to Jerusalem,
040	MAT	020	018	and the son of man shall be delivered to the chief priests and scribes, and they shall condemn Him to death,
040	MAT	020	019	and deliver Him up to the gentiles, to insult, and to scourge, and to crucify Him. But on the third day He shall rise again.
040	MAT	020	020	Then the mother of Zebedee's sons came to Him, together with her two sons, falling down before Him, and presenting a petition to Him.
040	MAT	020	021	And He said unto her, What dost thou desire? She saith unto Him, Grant that these my two sons may sit, one on thy right hand, and the other on the left in thy kingdom.
040	MAT	020	022	But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye ask: are ye able to drink of the cup which I am going to drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?
040	MAT	020	023	They replied, We are able. And He saith unto them, Ye shall indeed drink of my cup, and shall be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with; but to sit on my right hand and on my left is not mine to give, but to those for whom it is prepared by my Father.
040	MAT	020	024	And when the other ten heard it, they were provoked at the two brethren:
040	MAT	020	025	but Jesus called them to Him and said, Ye know that the princes of the gentiles lord it over them, and their great men exercise authority upon them:
040	MAT	020	026	it shall not be so among you; but whosoever would be great among you, let him be your minister, and whoever would be chief among you,
040	MAT	020	027	let him be your servant:
040	MAT	020	028	as the Son of man came not to be ministred unto, but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many.
040	MAT	020	029	And as they were going from Jericho, a great multitude followed Him:
040	MAT	020	030	and behold, two blind men siting by the way-side, when they heard that Jesus was passing by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou son of David.
040	MAT	020	031	And the people rebuked them, that they might hold their peace: but they cried out the more, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou son of David.
040	MAT	020	032	And Jesus stopt and called them, and said, What do ye desire me to do for you?
040	MAT	020	033	They answered Him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.
040	MAT	020	034	And Jesus had compassion on them, and touched their eyes; and straightway their eyes received sight, and they followed Him.
040	MAT	021	001	And when they drew nigh to Jerusalem and were come to Bethphage at the mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of his disciples,
040	MAT	021	002	saying unto them, Go into the village over-against you, and ye will find directly an ass tied and a colt with her: loose them and bring them to me:
040	MAT	021	003	and if any one say any thing to you, tell him the Lord hath need of them, and he will immediately send them.
040	MAT	021	004	Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying, Tell ye the daughter of Sion,
040	MAT	021	005	behold, thy king cometh unto thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass, even a colt the fole of an ass.
040	MAT	021	006	And the disciples went, and did as Jesus ordered them,
040	MAT	021	007	and brought the ass and the colt, and threw their clothes over them, and set Him upon them.
040	MAT	021	008	And great numbers spread their garments in the way, and others cut off boughs from the trees, and strewed them in the way:
040	MAT	021	009	and the multitudes, that went before and that followed, cried saying, Hosanna to the Son of David: blessed be He that cometh in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.
040	MAT	021	010	And when He came into Jerusalem, all the city was in a commotion, saying, Who is this?
040	MAT	021	011	And the people answered, This is Jesus the prophet, from Nazareth in Galilee.
040	MAT	021	012	And Jesus went into the temple of God, and drove out all that were selling and buying in the court of the temple, and threw down the tables of the money-changers, and the seats of them that sold doves:
040	MAT	021	013	and said to them, It is written, "My house shall be called the house of prayer," but ye have made it a den of thieves.
040	MAT	021	014	And there came to Him in the temple both blind and lame, and He healed them:
040	MAT	021	015	but when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonders that He wrought, and the children crying out in the temple, Hosanna to the Son of David, they were vexed to the heart, and said to Him, Dost thou hear what these say?
040	MAT	021	016	And Jesus saith unto them, Yes, have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast procured praise?
040	MAT	021	017	And He left them and went out of the city to Bethany and lodged there.
040	MAT	021	018	Now in the morning as He was returning to the city, He was hungry;
040	MAT	021	019	and seeing a fig-tree by the way, He went up to it, and finding nothing upon it but leaves, He saith to it, Let no fruit ever hereafter grow out of thee: and the fig-tree withered immediately.
040	MAT	021	020	And the disciples seeing it were amazed and said, How suddenly is the fig-tree withered!
040	MAT	021	021	but Jesus answering said unto them, Verily I tell you, if ye have faith and doubt not, ye shall not only be able to do this to a fig-tree, but also if ye shall say to this mountain, "Be thou removed and cast into the sea," it shall be done.
040	MAT	021	022	And all things whatsoever ye ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.
040	MAT	021	023	And when He was come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to Him as He was teaching, and said, By what authority dost thou these things, and who gave thee this authority?
040	MAT	021	024	but Jesus answered them, I also will ask you one question, which if ye tell me, I will likewise tell you by what authority I do these things.
040	MAT	021	025	The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven, or of men? And they reasoned with themselves saying, If we say, from heaven, He will reply, Why then did ye not believe him?
040	MAT	021	026	But if we say, of men, we fear the people, for they all esteem John as a prophet.
040	MAT	021	027	And therefore in answer to Jesus, they said, We do not know: and He said unto them, Neither do I tell you, by what authority I do these things.
040	MAT	021	028	But what think ye of this? There was a man had two sons, and he came to the first and said, Son, go, work to day in my vineyard:
040	MAT	021	029	and he answered I will not; but afterwards repenting, he went.
040	MAT	021	030	And coming to the second, he spake in like manner: and he answered, Yes, Sir; and went not.
040	MAT	021	031	Now which of the two did the will of his father? They say unto Him, The first. Jesus replied, Verily I say unto you, that publicans and prostitutes enter into the kingdom of God before you:
040	MAT	021	032	for John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye did not believe him; but publicans and harlots believed him; and though ye saw that, ye did not repent afterwards, to believe him.
040	MAT	021	033	Hear another parable, There was a certain man, a master of a family, that planted a vineyard, and made a fence about it, and put a wine-press in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and travelled abroad.
040	MAT	021	034	And when the fruit-season drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, to receive the fruits of it:
040	MAT	021	035	and the husbandmen took his servants and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.
040	MAT	021	036	And he sent again other servants more than the first: and they did the like to them.
040	MAT	021	037	At last he sent unto them his Son, saying, They will reverence my Son.
040	MAT	021	038	But when the husbandmen saw the Son, they said among themselves, This is the heir, come, let us kill him, and seize on his inheritance:
040	MAT	021	039	so they took him and cast him out of the vineyard and slew him.
040	MAT	021	040	When therefore the lord of the vineyard cometh, what will he do to those husbandmen?
040	MAT	021	041	They answer, He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will let out the vineyard to other husbandmen, who will render him the fruits in their seasons.
040	MAT	021	042	Then saith Jesus to them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, "The stone which the builders refused, is made the head of the corner: this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?"
040	MAT	021	043	Therefore I tell you, that the kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation, that will bring forth the fruits thereof.
040	MAT	021	044	And he that stumbleth at this stone shall be bruised, but on whomsoever it falls, it will crush him to pieces.
040	MAT	021	045	And when the chief priests and pharisees heard his parables, they perceived that He spake of them:
040	MAT	021	046	and would have seized Him, but that they were afraid of the people; because they took Him for a prophet.
040	MAT	022	001	And Jesus resuming his discourse spake unto them again in parables,
040	MAT	022	002	saying, The kingdom of heaven is like a certain king, who made a wedding-feast for his son;
040	MAT	022	003	and sent his servants to call those that were invited to the wedding: and they would not come.
040	MAT	022	004	Then he sent other servants, saying, Tell them that are invited, I have prepared my dinner, my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready; come to the wedding.
040	MAT	022	005	But they slighted him, and went away, one to his field and another to his merchandize:
040	MAT	022	006	and others seized his servants, and shamefully abused them, and slew them.
040	MAT	022	007	And when the king heard of it, he was highly provoked, and sent his troops, and destroyed those murderers, and burnt their city.
040	MAT	022	008	Then saith he to his servants, The feast is ready, but they that were invited were not worthy of it:
040	MAT	022	009	go therefore into the public streets, and as many as ye meet with invite to the wedding.
040	MAT	022	010	And those servants went out into the high-ways, and brought in all they met with, both bad and good: and the wedding was filled with guests.
040	MAT	022	011	But when the king came in to look at the guests, he saw there a man that had not put on a wedding-garment, and saith to him,
040	MAT	022	012	Friend, how camest thou in here without a wedding-garment? and he was struck speechless.
040	MAT	022	013	Then said the king to his attendants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him up, and throw him out into the darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of the teeth:
040	MAT	022	014	for there are many called, but few approved.
040	MAT	022	015	Then the pharisees went and consulted how they might insnare Him in his discourse.
040	MAT	022	016	And they send to Him their disciples along with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that thou art a man of truth, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest for any man; for thou regardest not the person of men: Tell us therefore what thou thinkest,
040	MAT	022	017	Is it lawful to give tribute to Cesar, or not?
040	MAT	022	018	But Jesus knew their malice, and said, Why do ye tempt me, ye hypocrites?
040	MAT	022	019	Shew me the tribute-money. And they brought Him a Roman Penny.
040	MAT	022	020	And He saith unto them, Whose image and inscription is this?
040	MAT	022	021	They answered, Cesar's. Then saith He unto them, Render therefore to Cesar the things that are Cesar's; and to God the things that are God's.
040	MAT	022	022	And when they heard this, they marvelled, and left Him and went away.
040	MAT	022	023	On the same day came the sadducees to Him, who say there is no resurrection,
040	MAT	022	024	and asked Him, saying, Master, Moses said, If any man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife and raise up seed unto his brother.
040	MAT	022	025	Now there were with us seven brothers, and the first married and died, and having no issue left his wife to his brother;
040	MAT	022	026	likewise the second also, and the third, even to seven;
040	MAT	022	027	and last of all the woman died also;
040	MAT	022	028	therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her.
040	MAT	022	029	But Jesus answered them, Ye are mistaken, not knowing the scriptures nor the power of God:
040	MAT	022	030	for in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels of God in heaven.
040	MAT	022	031	But concerning the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read what is spoken to you by God,
040	MAT	022	032	saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.
040	MAT	022	033	And when the people heard this, they were astonished at his doctrine.
040	MAT	022	034	But when the pharisees heard that He had silenced the sadducees,
040	MAT	022	035	they gathered together again, and one of them, an interpreter of the law, propounded a question, to try Him,
040	MAT	022	036	and said, Master, which is the greatest commandment in the law?
040	MAT	022	037	And Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind: this is the first and great command.
040	MAT	022	038	And the second is like it,
040	MAT	022	039	Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
040	MAT	022	040	On these two precepts depend all the law and the prophets.
040	MAT	022	041	Now while the pharisees were thus gathered together, Jesus asked them,
040	MAT	022	042	saying, What think ye of the Messiah? whose son is He? They say unto Him, David's.
040	MAT	022	043	He saith unto them, How then does David by inspiration call Him Lord,
040	MAT	022	044	saying, The Lord said unto my Lord, "Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool?"
040	MAT	022	045	therefore if David call Him Lord, how is He his son?
040	MAT	022	046	And no one was able to answer Him a word, nor did any dare, from that day, to ask Him any more such questions.
040	MAT	023	001	Then spake Jesus to the people and to his disciples, saying,
040	MAT	023	002	The scribes and pharisees sit in the seat of Moses:
040	MAT	023	003	observe therefore and do all things whatsoever they tell you to observe; but do not ye according to their works, for they say and do not:
040	MAT	023	004	for they bind grievous and intolerable burthens, and impose them upon men; but they themselves will not put a finger to them:
040	MAT	023	005	but they do all their works to be seen by men; they make their phylacteries broad, and enlarge the fringes of their garments,
040	MAT	023	006	and love the uppermost places at feasts,
040	MAT	023	007	and the chief seats in the synagogues, and salutations in public assemblies, and to be called by men Rabbi, Rabbi.
040	MAT	023	008	But be not ye called Rabbi; for one is your instructor even Christ, and ye are all brethren.
040	MAT	023	009	Neither call any man upon earth Father; for one is your Father, who is in heaven:
040	MAT	023	010	neither be ye called masters; for one is your master, even Christ.
040	MAT	023	011	But let him that is greatest among you be your minister: and whosoever will exalt himself shall be abased,
040	MAT	023	012	and whosoever will humble himself shall be exalted.
040	MAT	023	013	But wo unto you scribes and pharisees, hypocrites, who shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in yourselves, nor suffer those that are entering to go in.
040	MAT	023	014	Wo unto you scribes and pharisees, hypocrites; for ye devour widows houses, and for a cover make long prayers: therefore ye shall receive the heavier judgement.
040	MAT	023	015	Wo unto you scribes and pharisees, hypocrites: for ye compass sea and land to make a proselyte, and when he is gained, ye make him more the child of hell than yourselves.
040	MAT	023	016	Wo unto you, ye blind guides, who say, If any one swear by the temple, it is nothing;
040	MAT	023	017	but if any man swear by the gold of the temple, the oath is binding. Foolish and blind creatures! for which is greater, the gold, or the temple that sanctifieth the gold?
040	MAT	023	018	And, If any one swear by the altar, it is nothing; but if any one swear by the gift upon it, he is bound.
040	MAT	023	019	O foolish and blind! for which is greater, the gift, or the altar which sanctifieth the gift?
040	MAT	023	020	He then, that sweareth by the altar, sweareth by it and by all things upon it:
040	MAT	023	021	and he, that sweareth by the temple, sweareth by it, and by Him that dwelleth in it:
040	MAT	023	022	and he, that sweareth by heaven, sweareth by the throne of God, and by Him that sitteth upon it.
040	MAT	023	023	Wo unto you scribes and pharisees, hypocrites, who tithe even your mint, and anise, and cummin, but neglect the weightier matters of the law, judgement, mercy, and fidelity: these ye ought undoubtedly to practise, and not to omit the others.
040	MAT	023	024	Blind guides, who strain out a gnat, and swallow a camel!
040	MAT	023	025	Wo unto you scribes and pharisees, hypocrites; for ye clean the outside of the cup and of the dish, but within they are full of rapine and intemperance:
040	MAT	023	026	thou blind pharisee, cleanse first the inside of the cup and of the dish, that the outside of them may be also clean.
040	MAT	023	027	Wo unto you scribes and pharisees, hypocrites; who are like whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful without, but within are full of the bones of the dead, and all manner of filthiness;
040	MAT	023	028	so do ye likewise outwardly appear to men to be righteous, but within are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.
040	MAT	023	029	Wo unto you scribes and pharisees, hypocrites; who build the tombs of the prophets, and adorn the monuments of the just,
040	MAT	023	030	and say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been concerned with them in shedding the blood of the prophets:
040	MAT	023	031	so that ye are witnesses yourselves, that ye are the children of those who killed the prophets:
040	MAT	023	032	fill up then the measure of your fathers, ye serpents, ye brood of vipers:
040	MAT	023	033	how can ye escape the damnation of hell?
040	MAT	023	034	For behold I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and scribes; and some of them ye will kill and crucify, and some of them ye will scourge in your synagogues, and persecute them from city to city:
040	MAT	023	035	that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel, to the blood of Zacharias the son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar.
040	MAT	023	036	Verily I tell you, all these things shall come upon this generation.
040	MAT	023	037	O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!
040	MAT	023	038	Behold your house shall be left you desolate:
040	MAT	023	039	for I tell you, ye shall not see me after this, till ye shall say, Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord.
040	MAT	024	001	And as Jesus went out, and was departing from the temple, his disciples came to observe to Him the magnificent buildings.
040	MAT	024	002	But Jesus said unto them, Do ye see all these things? Verily I tell you, there shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be demolished.
040	MAT	024	003	And when He was got to the mount of olives, the disciples came to Him in private and said, Tell us when these things shall be, and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world.
040	MAT	024	004	And Jesus answered them, See that no one deceive you:
040	MAT	024	005	for many shall come in my name saying, I am the Christ, and shall deceive many.
040	MAT	024	006	And ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars, but be not troubled; for all these must indeed come to pass, but the end is not yet.
040	MAT	024	007	For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes in several places:
040	MAT	024	008	all which are but the beginning of sorrows.
040	MAT	024	009	Then shall they afflict you, and kill you; and ye shall be hated by all nations for my name:
040	MAT	024	010	and then will many take offense, and betray one another, and hate one another: and many false prophets will rise up and deceive many:
040	MAT	024	011	and because iniquity shall abound,
040	MAT	024	012	the love of many will grow cold.
040	MAT	024	013	But he that endures to the end, shall be saved:
040	MAT	024	014	and this gospel of the kingdom of heaven shall be preached in all the world, for a testimony to all the nations; and then shall the end come.
040	MAT	024	015	When therefore ye shall see the desolating abomination, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing at the holy place, (let him, that readeth, attend) then let those in Judea flee to the mountains:
040	MAT	024	016	let not him that is at the top of the house come down into it,
040	MAT	024	017	to take any thing out of his house;
040	MAT	024	018	nor let him that is in the field return back to take his clothes.
040	MAT	024	019	But wo to them that are with child, and to them that give suck, in those days.
040	MAT	024	020	Pray that your flight be not in the winter, nor on the sabbath:
040	MAT	024	021	for there shall be then great affliction, such as has not been from the beginning of the world unto this time, no, nor ever shall be.
040	MAT	024	022	And unless those days be shortened, no one would be saved; but for the sake of the elect those days shall be shortened.
040	MAT	024	023	Then if any shall say to you, Behold here is the Messiah, or there; believe it not:
040	MAT	024	024	for there shall rise up false Christs, and false prophets, who shall shew great signs and prodigies, so as to deceive, if possible, even the elect.
040	MAT	024	025	Lo, I have told you before-hand: and therefore if they say to you,
040	MAT	024	026	Behold, he is in the desert, go not out: behold, he is the secret chambers, believe them not:
040	MAT	024	027	for as the lightning cometh from the east, and flashes in an instant even to the west, so shall be the coming of the Son of man.
040	MAT	024	028	For wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered together.
040	MAT	024	029	And immediately after the affliction of those days, the fun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give it's light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:
040	MAT	024	030	and then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven, and then shall all the tribes of the land mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming as on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory:
040	MAT	024	031	and He will send forth his messengers with a trumpet of a loud voice, and they shall gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.
040	MAT	024	032	Now learn a parable from the fig-tree: when it's branch is tender and bringeth forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh;
040	MAT	024	033	so ye also, when ye shall see all these things, know that it is near even at the doors.
040	MAT	024	034	Verily I tell you, this generation shall not pass away, till all these be fulfilled.
040	MAT	024	035	Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.
040	MAT	024	036	But of THAT day and hour knoweth no one, not even the angels of heaven, but my Father only:
040	MAT	024	037	for as the days of Noah were, so shall be also the coming of the Son of man;
040	MAT	024	038	for as in the days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, till the day that Noah entered into the ark,
040	MAT	024	039	and knew not of it till the deluge came and took them all away; so shall be also the coming of the Son of man.
040	MAT	024	040	Then there shall be two in the field, the one shall be taken and the other left:
040	MAT	024	041	and two women grinding at the mill, one taken and one left.
040	MAT	024	042	Watch therefore, for ye know not at what hour your Lord cometh:
040	MAT	024	043	but this ye know, that if the master of the house had known at what hour the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broke open: therefore be ye also ready;
040	MAT	024	044	for the Son of man cometh at a time that ye think not of.
040	MAT	024	045	Who then is the faithful and prudent servant, whom his lord hath set over his family to give them food in due season?
040	MAT	024	046	blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so employed:
040	MAT	024	047	verily I tell you, that he will set him over his whole estate.
040	MAT	024	048	But if that servant be wicked and say in his heart, my master delayeth his coming,
040	MAT	024	049	and begin to beat his fellow-servants, and to revel with drunkards:
040	MAT	024	050	the lord of that servant will come in a day when he doth not expect him, and in an hour which he knows not,
040	MAT	024	051	and will cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with hypocrites: where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
040	MAT	025	001	Then will the kingdom of heaven be like ten virgins, who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom: and five of them were wise,
040	MAT	025	002	and five were foolish.
040	MAT	025	003	The foolish ones took their lamps, and took no oil with them:
040	MAT	025	004	but the wise took oil in their vessels as well as in their lamps.
040	MAT	025	005	Now while the bridegroom stayed, they were all drowsy and fell asleep:
040	MAT	025	006	and in the middle of the night there was a cry, The bridegroom is coming, go out to meet him.
040	MAT	025	007	Then all the virgins rose up and trimmed their lamps:
040	MAT	025	008	and the foolish ones said to the wise, Give us of your oil, for our lamps are going out:
040	MAT	025	009	but the wise answered them, saying, Least there should not be enough for us and you, go rather to them that sell it, and buy for yourselves.
040	MAT	025	010	And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came, and they that were ready went in with him to the wedding-feast, and then the door was shut.
040	MAT	025	011	Afterwards came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us:
040	MAT	025	012	but he answered them, Verily I declare unto you, I do not know you.
040	MAT	025	013	Watch therefore, for ye know not the day, nor the season in which the Son of man cometh.
040	MAT	025	014	For as a man, who was going to travel abroad, called his servants, and delivered to them his stock: and to one he gave five talents,
040	MAT	025	015	to another two, and to another one; to each according to his ability: and then he took his journey.
040	MAT	025	016	Now he that had received the five talents, went and traded with them, and gained other five talents:
040	MAT	025	017	and likewise he that had the two, he also gained two more:
040	MAT	025	018	but he who had received the one, went and digged in the earth, and hid his master's money:
040	MAT	025	019	and after some time the lord of those servants cometh and settleth his account with them.
040	MAT	025	020	And he who had received the five talents came and brought to him five talents more, saying, Sir, thou deliveredst to me five talents, behold I have gained other five talents to them:
040	MAT	025	021	and his lord said to him, Well done, my good and trusty servant, thou hast been faithful in a few things, I will set thee over many, enter into thy master's joy.
040	MAT	025	022	And he also who had received the two talents came to him and said, Lord, thou deliveredst to me two talents, behold I have gained two other talents with them:
040	MAT	025	023	his lord said to him, Well done, good and faithful servant, thou hast been faithful in a few things, I will set thee over many, enter into the joy of thy lord.
040	MAT	025	024	And he also who received the one talent came to him and said, Sir, I knew thee that thou art a hard man, reaping where thou sowedst not, and gathering where thou hast not strewed;
040	MAT	025	025	and I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the ground; behold, there is thine own:
040	MAT	025	026	but his lord answered and said to him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strewed;
040	MAT	025	027	thou oughtest then to have put my money to the bankers, and when I came I should have received my own with interest.
040	MAT	025	028	Take ye therefore the talent from him, and give it to him that hath the ten talents;
040	MAT	025	029	(for to every one that hath shall be given, and he shall abound; but from him that hath not, even what he hath, or seemeth to have, shall be taken away:)
040	MAT	025	030	and cast out the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness, where there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
040	MAT	025	031	So when the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with Him, then shall He sit upon his glorious throne:
040	MAT	025	032	and all nations shall be assembled before Him; and He shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divides the sheep from the goats:
040	MAT	025	033	and He shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on his left.
040	MAT	025	034	Then will the king say to them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:
040	MAT	025	035	for I was famishing, and ye gave me food; I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink; I was a stranger, and ye took me in;
040	MAT	025	036	I was naked, and ye clothed me; I was sick, and ye took care of me; I was in prison, and ye visited me.
040	MAT	025	037	Then will the righteous answer Him, saying, Lord, when did we see thee hungry, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?
040	MAT	025	038	and when did we see thee a stranger, and took thee in?
040	MAT	025	039	or naked, and clothed thee? and when did we see thee sick, or in prison, and visited thee?
040	MAT	025	040	And the king replying will say unto them, Verily I declare unto you, inasmuch as ye did it to one of the lest of these my brethren, ye did it to me.
040	MAT	025	041	Then will He say also to those on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:
040	MAT	025	042	for I was famishing, and ye gave me nothing to eat; I was a-thirst, and ye gave me no drink;
040	MAT	025	043	I was a stranger, and ye took me not in; naked, and ye clothed me not; sick, and in prison, and ye took no care of me.
040	MAT	025	044	Then will they also answer Him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee famishing, or a-thirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not relieve thee?
040	MAT	025	045	Then will He reply to them, saying, Verily I tell you, inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the lest of these, ye did it not to me.
040	MAT	025	046	And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life everlasting.
040	MAT	026	001	And when Jesus had finished these discourses, He said to his disciples,
040	MAT	026	002	Ye know that after two days the passover is to be kept, ---and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.
040	MAT	026	003	Now the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people were then assembled together into the palace of the high priest, whose name was Caiaphas:
040	MAT	026	004	and were consulting how they might take Jesus by treachery and put Him to death.
040	MAT	026	005	But they said, Not on the feast-day, least there should be a tumult among the people.
040	MAT	026	006	And when Jesus was at Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,
040	MAT	026	007	there came to Him a woman with an alabaster-box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head as He was at table:
040	MAT	026	008	but when his disciples saw it, they were some of them provoked at it, and said, Wherefore is this waste?
040	MAT	026	009	for this ointment might have been sold for a great deal of money, and given to the poor.
040	MAT	026	010	But Jesus, knowing what passed, said to them, Why do ye give the woman uneasiness? for she has done a good office to me:
040	MAT	026	011	(seeing ye have the poor always with you, but me ye have not always:) for in pouring this ointment on my body,
040	MAT	026	012	she has embalmed me for my burial.
040	MAT	026	013	Verily I tell you, wherever this gospel is preached, in the whole world, what she hath done shall also be spoken of for a memorial of her.
040	MAT	026	014	About this time went one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot,
040	MAT	026	015	to the chief priests, and said, What will ye give me, and I will deliver Him to you? and they promised him thirty pieces of silver:
040	MAT	026	016	and from that time he sought opportunity to betray Him.
040	MAT	026	017	Now upon the first day of the feast of unleavened bread, came the disciples to Jesus, saying, where wouldest thou have us make preparation for thee to eat the passover?
040	MAT	026	018	And He said, Go into the city, to such a man, and tell him, The master saith, my time is near, I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples: and the disciples did as Jesus ordered them,
040	MAT	026	019	and prepared the passover.
040	MAT	026	020	And when the evening was come, He sat down with the twelve:
040	MAT	026	021	and as they were eating, He said, Verily I tell you, that one of you will betray me.
040	MAT	026	022	And they were exceedingly grieved, and said to Him, every one of them, Lord, is it I?
040	MAT	026	023	and He answered, he that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, even he will betray me.
040	MAT	026	024	The Son of man is going indeed as it is written concerning Him: but wo to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed; it had been good for him, if that man had never been born.
040	MAT	026	025	And Judas, who betrayed Him, answered and said, Master, is it I? and He said unto him, It is.
040	MAT	026	026	Now as they were at table, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body:
040	MAT	026	027	and He took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it:
040	MAT	026	028	for this is my blood, the blood of the new covenant, which is to be shed for many for the remission of sins:
040	MAT	026	029	but I tell you, that from henceforth I shall not drink of the fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in the kingdom of my Father.
040	MAT	026	030	And when they had sung an hymn, they went out to the mount of Olives.
040	MAT	026	031	Then saith Jesus unto them, Ye will all take offence at me this night; for it is written, "I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered:"
040	MAT	026	032	but after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.
040	MAT	026	033	But Peter answered and said to Him, though they should all be offended in thee, yet will I never be offended.
040	MAT	026	034	Jesus said unto him, Verily I tell thee that this night, before the cock crow, thou wilt deny me thrice.
040	MAT	026	035	Peter replied, though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. And so likewise said all the disciples.
040	MAT	026	036	Then went Jesus with them to a place called Gethsemane, and saith to the disciples, Sit here, while I go there and pray:
040	MAT	026	037	and having taken with Him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, He began to be sorrowful and much distressed;
040	MAT	026	038	and saith unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death, stay here and watch with me.
040	MAT	026	039	And going a little farther, He prostrated himself, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt.
040	MAT	026	040	And coming to the disciples, he findeth them asleep, and saith to Peter, what! could ye not watch with me one hour?
040	MAT	026	041	Watch and pray that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.
040	MAT	026	042	And going away again, the second time He prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass from me, unless I drink it, thy will be done.
040	MAT	026	043	And He came and found them asleep again, for their eyes were heavy.
040	MAT	026	044	And He left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, to the same effect.
040	MAT	026	045	Then He cometh to his disciples and saith, Are ye sleeping still and taking your rest? behold, the hour is come, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
040	MAT	026	046	Rise, let us go, see the traitor is at hand.
040	MAT	026	047	And while He was yet speaking, behold, Judas one of the twelve came, and with him a great number, with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people:
040	MAT	026	048	(now he that betrayed Him, had given them a signal, saying, The man whom I shall kiss is He, lay hold of Him:)
040	MAT	026	049	and going directly up to Jesus, he said, Hail master, and kissed Him.
040	MAT	026	050	And Jesus said to him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? then they came up and laid hands on Jesus, and apprehended Him.
040	MAT	026	051	And one of them that were with Jesus, stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and striking at the high priest's servant took off his ear.
040	MAT	026	052	Then said Jesus to him, Put up thy sword into it's place; for they that take the sword shall perish by the sword:
040	MAT	026	053	dost thou think that I cannot now apply to my Father, and He will send me more than twelve legions of angels?
040	MAT	026	054	but how then should the scriptures be fulfilled, which say that thus it must be?
040	MAT	026	055	Then said Jesus to the multitudes, Ye are come out as against a thief with swords and clubs to take me, whereas I sat with you day after day teaching in the temple, and ye did not seize me: but all this is done,
040	MAT	026	056	that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.
040	MAT	026	057	Then all the disciples deserted Him and fled. And they, that apprehended Jesus, led Him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled:
040	MAT	026	058	and Peter followed Him at a distance, to the high-priest's palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, that he might see the issue.
040	MAT	026	059	Now the chief priests and elders, and the whole council sought false-witness against Jesus, that they might put Him to death: but found none.
040	MAT	026	060	And tho' many false witnesses came, they found none to their purpose. But at last came two false witnesses and said,
040	MAT	026	061	This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.
040	MAT	026	062	And the high priest stood up and said to Him, Dost thou make no answer? what do these men testify against thee? but Jesus made no reply.
040	MAT	026	063	Then the high priest said to Him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us, if thou be the Christ, the Son of God.
040	MAT	026	064	Jesus saith unto him, It is as thou hast said: and I tell you, hereafter ye shall see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of power, and coming on the clouds of heaven.
040	MAT	026	065	Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy, what need have we more of witnesses? now ye have heard his blasphemy, what think ye?
040	MAT	026	066	and they answered, He ought to be put to death.
040	MAT	026	067	Then did they spit in his face, and beat Him about the head; and some struck Him with rods,
040	MAT	026	068	saying, Divine to us, thou Christ, who it is that smote thee.
040	MAT	026	069	Now Peter was sitting without in the hall, and one of the maids came to him and said, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee:
040	MAT	026	070	but he denied it before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.
040	MAT	026	071	And he went out into the porch; after which another maid saw him, and said to them that were there, This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth:
040	MAT	026	072	and he denied a second time, and that with an oath, saying, I know not the man. And a little after, they that stood by came to Peter and said,
040	MAT	026	073	Verily thou also art one of them, for thy speech discovers thee:
040	MAT	026	074	then he began to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew.
040	MAT	026	075	And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, who had said to him, before the cock crow, thou wilt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.
040	MAT	027	001	And as soon as it was morning all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus, how to get Him executed:
040	MAT	027	002	so they bound Him and led Him away, and delivered Him to Pontius Pilate the Roman governor.
040	MAT	027	003	Then Judas, who had betrayed Him, when he saw that He was condemned, being struck with remorse, brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders,
040	MAT	027	004	saying, I have sinned, for I have betrayed innocent blood: but they said, What is that to us? see thou to that.
040	MAT	027	005	And he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself.
040	MAT	027	006	But the chief priests took up the pieces of silver, and said, It is not lawful to put them into the treasury of the temple, because it is the price of blood:
040	MAT	027	007	so they consulted together, and bought with them the potter's field for a burying-ground for strangers:
040	MAT	027	008	and therefore that field is called the field of blood to this day.
040	MAT	027	009	Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was estimated, on whom the children of Israel set the price,
040	MAT	027	010	and gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed me.
040	MAT	027	011	And Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked Him, saying, Art thou the king of the Jews? And Jesus answered him, It is as thou sayest.
040	MAT	027	012	And when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, He answered nothing.
040	MAT	027	013	Then saith Pilate to Him, Dost thou not hear how many things they witness against thee?
040	MAT	027	014	but He answered him not one word: so that the governor was much astonished.
040	MAT	027	015	Now the governor used at the feast to release a prisoner to the people, whomsoever they desired:
040	MAT	027	016	and they had then a notorious malefactor named Barabbas.
040	MAT	027	017	Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you?
040	MAT	027	018	Barabbas, or Jesus, who is called Christ? for he knew that out of envy they had delivered Him up.
040	MAT	027	019	(And while he was sitting on the tribunal, his wife sent to him, saying, Have nothing to do with that righteous man: for I have suffered much in a dream to day on his account.)
040	MAT	027	020	But the chief priests and elders persuaded the common people to ask for Barabbas, and so to destroy Jesus.
040	MAT	027	021	And the governor said to them, Which of the two would you have me release to you? and they said, Barabbas.
040	MAT	027	022	What shall I do then, saith Pilate, with Jesus, who is called Christ? They all cried out, Let Him be crucified.
040	MAT	027	023	And the governor said, Why, what evil hath He done? but they cried out the more, saying, Let Him be crucified.
040	MAT	027	024	Pilate seeing that he prevailed nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, took water and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just man, look ye to it:
040	MAT	027	025	and all the people answered and said, His blood be on us, and on our children.
040	MAT	027	026	Then he released to them Barabbas: but he ordered Jesus to be scourged, and delivered Him to be crucified.
040	MAT	027	027	Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the hall, and gathered the whole band about Him:
040	MAT	027	028	and when they had stript Him, they covered Him with a scarlet robe;
040	MAT	027	029	and having platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand; and they bowed the knee before Him in derision, saying, Hail king of the Jews:
040	MAT	027	030	and they spit upon Him, and took the reed and struck Him on the head.
040	MAT	027	031	And after they had thus abused Him, they took off the scarlet robe from Him, and put on Him his own clothes, and led Him away to be crucified.
040	MAT	027	032	And as they were going along they met with a man of Cyrene, whose name was Simon; and forced him to carry the cross.
040	MAT	027	033	And when they were come to a place called Golgotha, that is to say,
040	MAT	027	034	the place of a skull, they gave Him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: but when He had tasted it, He would not drink.
040	MAT	027	035	And after they had fixed Him to the cross, they parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled, which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots.
040	MAT	027	036	And they sat down and watched Him there: and put up over his head his accusation in writing,
040	MAT	027	037	THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
040	MAT	027	038	And there were two thieves crucified with Him: one on his right hand, and one on the left.
040	MAT	027	039	And they that passed by reviled Him, shaking their heads,
040	MAT	027	040	and saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it again in three days, save thyself: if thou art the Son of God, come down from the cross.
040	MAT	027	041	And in like manner the chief priests also insulting Him, with the scribes and elders,
040	MAT	027	042	said, He saved others, himself He cannot save: if He be the king of Israel, let Him come down now from the cross, and we will believe Him:
040	MAT	027	043	He trusted in God, let Him deliver Him now, if He will own Him; for He said, I am the Son of God.
040	MAT	027	044	And one of the thieves also, that were crucified with Him, cast the same reproach upon Him.
040	MAT	027	045	Now from the sixth hour to the ninth there was darkness over all the land.
040	MAT	027	046	And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, "Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani," that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?
040	MAT	027	047	And some of them that stood by, hearing Him, said, He calls upon Elias:
040	MAT	027	048	and immediately one of them ran, and took a spunge, and having filled it with vinegar put it upon a reed, and offered it Him to drink;
040	MAT	027	049	the rest said, Stay, let us see whether Elias will come and save Him.
040	MAT	027	050	But Jesus cried out again with a loud voice; and then gave up the ghost.
040	MAT	027	051	And behold the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom, and the earth was shaken, and the rocks were split:
040	MAT	027	052	and the graves opened, and many bodies of departed saints arose,
040	MAT	027	053	and coming out of the graves, after his resurrection, went into the holy city, and appeared unto many.
040	MAT	027	054	And when the centurion, and they that were with him guarding Jesus, saw the earthquake, and what was done, they were sore afraid, and said, This was indeed the Son of God.
040	MAT	027	055	And several women were there looking on at a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministring unto Him:
040	MAT	027	056	among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee's children.
040	MAT	027	057	And in the evening, there came a rich man of Arimathea, whose name was Joseph, who also himself was a disciple of Jesus, and went to Pilate,
040	MAT	027	058	and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered the body to be delivered to him;
040	MAT	027	059	and Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,
040	MAT	027	060	and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had had cut out in the rock; and when he had rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, he went away:
040	MAT	027	061	but there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary sitting over against the sepulchre.
040	MAT	027	062	Now the next day after the preparation, the chief priests and pharisees went together to Pilate, saying, Sir, we remember that this impostor,
040	MAT	027	063	when He was alive, said, After three days I will rise again:
040	MAT	027	064	order therefore the sepulchre to be secured till the third day, least his disciples should come and steal Him away, and tell the people, He is risen from the dead: and so the last error will be worse than the first.
040	MAT	027	065	But Pilate said to them, Ye have a guard of your own, go and make it as secure as ye will.
040	MAT	027	066	So they went and made the sepulchre safe, sealing the stone, and setting a guard to watch it.
040	MAT	028	001	Now after the sabbath, in the dawning towards the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, to look at the sepulchre:
040	MAT	028	002	and behold, there had been a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord descending from heaven, had come and rolled away the stone from the door, and was sitting upon it:
040	MAT	028	003	(and his countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:
040	MAT	028	004	and the guards shook for fear of him, and became like dead men:)
040	MAT	028	005	and the angel said to the women, Be not ye afraid: for I know that ye seek Jesus who was crucified.
040	MAT	028	006	He is not here, for He is risen, as He said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay:
040	MAT	028	007	and go quickly, and tell his disciples that He is risen from the dead; and behold, He is going before you into Galilee; there ye shall see Him; lo, I have told you.
040	MAT	028	008	And they went immediately from the sepulchre, with fear, and great joy, and ran to tell his disciples.
040	MAT	028	009	And as they were going to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them and said, God save you. And they drew near and embraced his feet, and worshipped Him.
040	MAT	028	010	Then saith Jesus unto them, Be not afraid, go tell my brethren to repair into Galilee, and there they shall see me.
040	MAT	028	011	Now while they were going, behold some of the guard came into the city, and told the chief priests all that had happened:
040	MAT	028	012	and they assembled with the elders, and taking counsel together gave the soldiers a large sum of money,
040	MAT	028	013	saying, Do you say, that his disciples came by night, and stole Him away, while we were asleep.
040	MAT	028	014	And if this should come to a hearing before the governor, we will satisfy him, and indemnify you.
040	MAT	028	015	So they took the money, and did as they were instructed: and this is commonly reported among the Jews to this day.
040	MAT	028	016	And the eleven disciples went into Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had appointed them.
040	MAT	028	017	And when they saw Him, they worshipped Him: but some doubted.
040	MAT	028	018	And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me both in heaven and on earth.
040	MAT	028	019	Go ye therefore and instruct all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son,
040	MAT	028	020	and of the holy Ghost, and teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the world. Amen.

# BOOK	041	MAR	Mark	Mark
041	MAR	001	001	The beginning of the gospel of JESUS CHRIST the Son of GOD.
041	MAR	001	002	As it is written in the prophets, "Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee:"
041	MAR	001	003	and again, "The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight:" accordingly John came baptizing in the wilderness,
041	MAR	001	004	and preaching the baptism of repentance in order to the remission of sins;
041	MAR	001	005	and all the country of Judea, and those of Jerusalem, went out to him, and were all baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.
041	MAR	001	006	And John was clothed with camels hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins, and he lived upon locusts and wild honey: and he preached,
041	MAR	001	007	saying, There cometh after me one mightier than I, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop and unloose.
041	MAR	001	008	I indeed have baptized you with water, but He will baptize you with the holy Spirit.
041	MAR	001	009	And in those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by John in Jordan:
041	MAR	001	010	and as soon as He came up from the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon Him.
041	MAR	001	011	And there was a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.
041	MAR	001	012	And immediately the Spirit taketh Him out into the wilderness:
041	MAR	001	013	and He was there in the wilderness forty days tempted by Satan, and among the wild beasts: and angels ministred unto Him.
041	MAR	001	014	Now after John was cast into prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,
041	MAR	001	015	and saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent, and believe the gospel.
041	MAR	001	016	And as He was walking by the sea of Galilee, He saw Simon and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea,
041	MAR	001	017	(for they were fishermen,) and Jesus said unto them, Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men:
041	MAR	001	018	and immediately they left their nets and followed Him.
041	MAR	001	019	And going a little farther, He saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship, mending their nets, and immediately called them likewise:
041	MAR	001	020	and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the men he had hired, and went along with Him.
041	MAR	001	021	And they went into Capernaum: and going directly into the synagogue on the sabbath, He taught the people: and they were astonished at his doctrine;
041	MAR	001	022	for He taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes.
041	MAR	001	023	And there was in their synagogue a man with an impure spirit,
041	MAR	001	024	and he cried out, saying, Let us alone, what have we to do with thee, Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee, who thou art, the holy one of God.
041	MAR	001	025	And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Be silent, and come out of him: and the impure spirit threw him into convulsions,
041	MAR	001	026	and roaring with a loud voice, came out of him.
041	MAR	001	027	And they were all amazed, so that they inquired of each other, saying, What is this, what new kind of doctrine is this? for He commands with authority even the impure spirits, and they obey Him.
041	MAR	001	028	And straitway his fame spread into all the country round about Galilee.
041	MAR	001	029	And as soon as they came out of the synagogue, they went into the house of Simon and Andrew, together with James and John.
041	MAR	001	030	And Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever: and they immediately told Him of her:
041	MAR	001	031	and He came to her, and taking her by the hand raised her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she waited upon them.
041	MAR	001	032	And in the evening, when the sun set, they brought to Him all that were ill, and demoniacs:
041	MAR	001	033	and the whole city was gathered together at the door;
041	MAR	001	034	and He healed many that were ill of various diseases, and cast out many devils, and suffered not the devils to say that they knew Him.
041	MAR	001	035	And in the morning, before it was light, He rose up and went out, and retired into a solitary place, and there prayed.
041	MAR	001	036	And Simon, and they that were with him, went in quest of Him:
041	MAR	001	037	and when they found Him, they said to Him, all the people are seeking for thee.
041	MAR	001	038	And He saith unto them, Let us go into the neighbouring towns, that I may preach there also; for this was the end of my coming.
041	MAR	001	039	And He went preaching in their synagogues, through all Galilee, and casting out devils.
041	MAR	001	040	And there came to Him a leper, beseeching Him, and kneeling down to Him, and saying unto Him, If thou wilt, thou canst cleanse me:
041	MAR	001	041	and Jesus, being moved with compassion, stretched out his hand and touched him, and saith unto Him, I will;
041	MAR	001	042	be thou healed: and as soon as He had spoken, immediately the leprosy left him, and he was healed.
041	MAR	001	043	And he gave him a strict charge, and immediately dismissed him,
041	MAR	001	044	and saith unto him, See thou tell no man: but go, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy purification what Moses has commanded, for a testimony to them.
041	MAR	001	045	But when he was gone he began to publish it much, and to spread abroad the report: so that Jesus could no more go openly into the city, but kept out in country places: and they came to Him from all parts.
041	MAR	002	001	And after some days He went again into Capernaum; and it being heard that He was in the house,
041	MAR	002	002	great numbers were immediately gathered together, so that there was no more room to contain them, not even about the door: and as he was preaching the word unto them,
041	MAR	002	003	there came some to Him, bringing a paralytic who was carried by four men:
041	MAR	002	004	and not being able to come near to Him for the croud, they uncovered the roof where He was, and when they had made an openning, they let down the couch on which the paralytic was laid.
041	MAR	002	005	And Jesus, seeing their faith, saith to him that had the palsy, Son, thy sins are forgiven thee.
041	MAR	002	006	But there were some of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts,
041	MAR	002	007	Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins but God?
041	MAR	002	008	And Jesus, who knew immediately in his spirit that they were thus reasoning within themselves, said unto them, Why do ye dispute these things in your hearts?
041	MAR	002	009	Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, Thy sins are forgiven; or to say, Rise, take up thy couch, and walk?
041	MAR	002	010	But that ye may know, that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins,
041	MAR	002	011	I say unto thee (saith He to the paralytic,) Arise, and take up thy couch, and go thy way to thine own house.
041	MAR	002	012	And he instantly arose, and taking up his couch, went out before them all, so that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, we never saw the like.
041	MAR	002	013	And He went out again towards the sea-side, and all the people resorted to Him, and He taught them.
041	MAR	002	014	And as He went along, He saw Levi the son of Alpheus, sitting at the receit of custom, and saith unto him, Follow me: and he rose up and followed Him.
041	MAR	002	015	And as He sat at table in his house, many publicans and sinners also sat down with Jesus and his disciples: for there were many, and they followed Him.
041	MAR	002	016	And the scribes and pharisees, when they saw Him eating with publicans and sinners, said to his disciples, What is the meaning that He eateth with publicans and sinners?
041	MAR	002	017	Which Jesus hearing, saith unto them, They that are in health have no need of a physician, but they that are ill: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners.
041	MAR	002	018	And as the disciples of John, and of the pharisees used to fast, they came to Him, saying, Why do the disciples of John and of the pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?
041	MAR	002	019	And Jesus said unto them, Can the bridemen fast, when the bridegroom is with them? while the bridegroom is with them, they cannot fast:
041	MAR	002	020	but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them; and then shall they fast.
041	MAR	002	021	No man seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment; otherwise, it's new patch teareth from the old, and the rent is made worse:
041	MAR	002	022	nor does any one put new wine into old vessels; otherwise the new wine bursteth the vessels, and the wine is spilt, and the vessels are destroyed: but new wine should be put into new vessels.
041	MAR	002	023	And as He was going thro' the corn-fields on the sabbath-day, his disciples began as they went along to pluck the ears of corn.
041	MAR	002	024	And the pharisees said to Him, See, why do they what is not lawful to be done on the sabbath-day?
041	MAR	002	025	And He said unto them, Have ye never read what David did, in his necessity, when he was hungry, himself and those that were with him?
041	MAR	002	026	how he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar, who was afterwards the high priest, and did eat the shew-bread, which it is not lawful for any to eat, but the priests, and gave also to them that were with him!
041	MAR	002	027	And He said moreover unto them, The sabbath was made for man, not man for the sabbath:
041	MAR	002	028	and therefore the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath.
041	MAR	003	001	And He went another time into a synagogue, where there was a man that had a withered hand:
041	MAR	003	002	and they watched Him, whether He would heal him on the sabbath-day, that they might accuse Him.
041	MAR	003	003	And He said to the man, that had the withered hand, Rise up into the midst:
041	MAR	003	004	then saith He to them, Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath, or to do evil? to save life, or to kill? but they were silent.
041	MAR	003	005	And when He had looked round upon them with indignation, being grieved at the hardness of their hearts, He saith to the man, Stretch out thine hand: and he stretched it out, and his hand was made as sound as the other.
041	MAR	003	006	And the pharisees went out, and immediately took counsel with the Herodians against Him, how to destroy Him:
041	MAR	003	007	but Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the sea.
041	MAR	003	008	And a great multitude from Galilee followed Him, and from Judea, and from Jerusalem, and from Idumea, and from beyond Jordan; and those about Tyre and Sidon, a great number, hearing how great things He did, came unto Him.
041	MAR	003	009	Therefore He spake to his disciples, that there might be a small vessel attending Him, because of the multitude, least they should throng Him: for He had healed many,
041	MAR	003	010	so that whoever had any maladies, crouded upon Him to touch Him.
041	MAR	003	011	And impure spirits, when they saw Him, fell down before Him, and cried out, saying, Thou art the Son of God:
041	MAR	003	012	but He strictly charged them not to make Him known.
041	MAR	003	013	Then going up into a mountain, He calleth for such as He saw fit, and they came to Him:
041	MAR	003	014	and He appointed twelve to be with Him, and that He might send them forth to preach the gospel,
041	MAR	003	015	and to have power to heal diseases, and to cast out demons;
041	MAR	003	016	even Simon, whom He surnamed Peter,
041	MAR	003	017	and James the Son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James, (and He surnamed them Boanerges, which is to say, Sons of thunder,) and Andrew,
041	MAR	003	018	and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alpheus, and Thaddeus,
041	MAR	003	019	and Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, even him who betrayed Him.
041	MAR	003	020	And they went into a house, and the multitude came together again, so that they could not so much as eat.
041	MAR	003	021	And when his friends heard of it, they went out to lay hold on Him; for they said He spends Himself too much.
041	MAR	003	022	And the scribes that came down from Jerusalem said, He is in league with Beelzebub, and casts out demons by the help of the prince of demons.
041	MAR	003	023	So He called them to Him, and said unto them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan?
041	MAR	003	024	If a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand:
041	MAR	003	025	and if a family be divided against itself, that family cannot stand: and if Satan oppose himself and be divided,
041	MAR	003	026	he cannot stand, but his kingdom is at an end.
041	MAR	003	027	No one can enter into the house of a strong man, and plunder his goods; unless he first bind the strong man, and then he may pillage his house.
041	MAR	003	028	Verily I tell you, that all sins shall be forgiven to the sons of men, and blasphemies wherewith they may blaspheme:
041	MAR	003	029	but whosoever blasphemeth against the holy Ghost never hath forgiveness, but is liable to eternal damnation:
041	MAR	003	030	for they said, He hath an impure spirit.
041	MAR	003	031	So his brethren and his mother came, and standing without sent to Him to call Him to them:
041	MAR	003	032	and there was a multitude sitting about Him, and they said to Him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren are without inquiring for thee.
041	MAR	003	033	And He answered them, and said, Who is my mother, or my brethren?
041	MAR	003	034	And looking round on those that sat about Him, He said, Behold my mother, and my brethren:
041	MAR	003	035	for whosoever doth the will of God, he is to me as my brother, my sister, and mother.
041	MAR	004	001	And He began to teach again by the sea-side, and there was gathered unto Him a great multitude; so that He went into a ship, and sat on board, and all the people were by the sea, upon the shore.
041	MAR	004	002	And He taught them many things by similitudes, and said to them in his instruction,
041	MAR	004	003	hearken, Behold a sower went out to sow:
041	MAR	004	004	and in sowing, some fell by the way-side, and the birds came and ate it up:
041	MAR	004	005	and some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth, and it sprang up immediately, because it had not depth of earth;
041	MAR	004	006	but when the sun rose, it was burnt up, and withered because it had no root:
041	MAR	004	007	and some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it yielded no fruit:
041	MAR	004	008	and other fell on good ground, and yielded fruit springing up and increasing; and produced some thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred-fold.
041	MAR	004	009	And He said unto them, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
041	MAR	004	010	And when He was apart from the multitude, those that were about Him with the twelve asked Him concerning the parable.
041	MAR	004	011	And he said unto them, To you it is granted to know the mystery of the kingdom of God; but unto them that are without all things are delivered in parables:
041	MAR	004	012	that in seeing they may see and not perceive, and in hearing they may hear and not understand, least they should be converted, and their sins be forgiven them.
041	MAR	004	013	Then saith He unto them, Do ye not understand this parable? how then will ye understand all my other parables.
041	MAR	004	014	The sower is he that soweth the word. And these are they by the way-side:
041	MAR	004	015	where the word is sown; but when they have heard it, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts.
041	MAR	004	016	And in like manner, they that are sown as on stony grounds are such, as when they hear the word,
041	MAR	004	017	immediately receive it with joy, but have no root in themselves, and so continue but for a short season: and then, when affliction cometh, or persecution on account of the word, they are as soon offended.
041	MAR	004	018	And those that are sown as among thorns, are these: such as hear the word indeed,
041	MAR	004	019	but the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and inordinate desires after other things entering in choke the word, and so it becometh unfruitful.
041	MAR	004	020	And these are they who are like seed sown on good ground: such as hear the word, and receive it; and bring forth fruit, some thirty-fold, and some sixty, and some an hundred.
041	MAR	004	021	And He said unto them, Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel, or a bed, and not to be set on a candlestick?
041	MAR	004	022	for there is nothing hidden, which may not be revealed; nor was there any thing concealed, but in order to become manifest.
041	MAR	004	023	If any one hath ears to hear, let him hear.
041	MAR	004	024	And mind what ye hear: for with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you; and more shall be imparted to you that are observant:
041	MAR	004	025	for whosoever hath, to him more shall be given; and he that hath not, even what he hath, or seemeth to have, shall be taken from him.
041	MAR	004	026	And He said, The kingdom of God is as if a man should cast seed into the ground,
041	MAR	004	027	and sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring up, and increase; he knows not how.
041	MAR	004	028	For the earth produces fruit of itself, first the blade, then the ear, then the full corn in the ear:
041	MAR	004	029	but when the fruit is ripe, he immediately puts in the sickle, because the harvest is come.
041	MAR	004	030	And He said, To what shall we compare the kingdom of God, or by what similitude shall we represent it?
041	MAR	004	031	It is like to a grain of mustard-seed, which when it is sown in the ground, is one of the lest of all the seeds on the earth:
041	MAR	004	032	but after it is sown, it grows up, and becomes greater than all herbs, and produces large branches, so that the birds of the air may lodge under it's shadow.
041	MAR	004	033	And in many such parables spake He the word to them, as they had ability to hear it: but spake not to them without a parable.
041	MAR	004	034	And He explained all to his disciples in private.
041	MAR	004	035	And the same day, in the evening, He saith to them, Let us go over to the other side.
041	MAR	004	036	So they dismissed the multitude, and took Him as He was in the ship. But there were other small vessels likewise with Him.
041	MAR	004	037	And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now almost full.
041	MAR	004	038	And He was in the stern asleep on a pillow: and they awake Him, and say unto Him, Master, art thou under no concern that we are perishing?
041	MAR	004	039	And He rose and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still; and the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.
041	MAR	004	040	And He said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how! have ye no faith?
041	MAR	004	041	And they were exceedingly afraid, and said to one another, Who is this? that even the wind and the sea obey Him?
041	MAR	005	001	And they came to the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes.
041	MAR	005	002	And when He was come out of the ship, immediately there met Him from the tombs,
041	MAR	005	003	a man with an impure spirit, who kept among the tombs; and no one could bind him, not even with chains:
041	MAR	005	004	for he had often been bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been pulled asunder by him, and the fetters broken; and no man could tame him:
041	MAR	005	005	and he was always night and day upon the hills and among the sepulchres bawling, and gashing himself with stones.
041	MAR	005	006	But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped Him,
041	MAR	005	007	and crying out with a loud voice said, Jesus thou Son of the most high God, what have I to do with thee? I adjure thee by God, that thou wouldst not torment me:
041	MAR	005	008	(for He said to him, Thou impure spirit, come out of the man.)
041	MAR	005	009	And He asked him, What is thy name? And he answered, saying, My name is Legion: for we are many.
041	MAR	005	010	And he earnestly intreated Him, that He would not send them out of that country.
041	MAR	005	011	Now there was a great herd of swine feeding upon the mountains:
041	MAR	005	012	and all the demons intreated Him, saying, Send us to the swine, that we may enter into them.
041	MAR	005	013	And immediately Jesus permitted them: and the impure spirits went out of the man, and entered into the swine; and the herd (which were about two thousand,) ran violently down a precipice into the sea, and were suffocated.
041	MAR	005	014	And they that were feeding the swine fled, and told it in the city, and in the country. And they went out to see what was done:
041	MAR	005	015	and they come to Jesus, and see the demoniac, who had been possessed by the legion, sitting and clothed, and in his right mind; and they were afraid.
041	MAR	005	016	And when those that saw it told them what had happened to the demoniac,
041	MAR	005	017	and concerning the swine, they intreated Him to depart from their borders.
041	MAR	005	018	And as He went into the ship, the demoniac intreated Him that he might be with Him:
041	MAR	005	019	but Jesus did not permit him; but saith to him, Go home to thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and hath had compassion on thee:
041	MAR	005	020	and he departed, and published in Decapolis, how great things Jesus had done for him, and they were all amazed.
041	MAR	005	021	And when Jesus passed over again in the ship to the other side, a great multitude was gathered unto Him, nigh unto the sea.
041	MAR	005	022	And behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, named Jairus; and as soon as he saw Him, he fell at his feet,
041	MAR	005	023	and earnestly intreated Him, saying, My little daughter is at the point of death, I beseech thee that thou wouldst come and lay thy hands on her, that she may be healed, and she will live.
041	MAR	005	024	So Jesus went with him, and a great multitude followed Him, and pressed about Him.
041	MAR	005	025	And a woman who had been in a flux twelve years,
041	MAR	005	026	and had suffered a great deal from many physicians, and spent all that she had, and received no benefit, but rather grew worse,
041	MAR	005	027	when she heard of Jesus, came behind Him in the croud, and touched his garment; for she said,
041	MAR	005	028	If I can but touch his clothes, I shall be cured.
041	MAR	005	029	And immediately the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt within herself that she was healed of the disorder.
041	MAR	005	030	And immediately Jesus, knowing in Himself that power was gone out of Him, turned about in the croud and said, Who touched my clothes?
041	MAR	005	031	And his disciples said unto Him, Thou seest the multitude crouding about thee, and dost thou ask, Who touched me?
041	MAR	005	032	and He looked round about to see who had done it.
041	MAR	005	033	But the woman being afraid and trembling, as knowing what had been done in her, came and prostrated herself to Him, and told Him all the truth:
041	MAR	005	034	and He said to her, Daughter, thy faith has saved thee; go in peace, and be healed of thy disorder.
041	MAR	005	035	While He was yet speaking, there came some from the ruler of the synagogue's house, saying, Thy daughter is dead, why dost thou trouble the Master any more?
041	MAR	005	036	But Jesus hearing the word that was spoken, immediately saith to the ruler of the synagogue, Fear not, only believe:
041	MAR	005	037	and He suffered none to go along with Him, but Peter, and James, and John the brother of James.
041	MAR	005	038	And He cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and seeth a tumult, people weeping and lamenting greatly:
041	MAR	005	039	and when He was come in, He saith unto them, Why do ye take on thus and weep? the child is not dead, but asleep.
041	MAR	005	040	And they laughed at Him: but when He had turned them all out, He taketh the father, and the mother of the child, and those three that were with Him, and goes in where the child was laid:
041	MAR	005	041	and taking hold of her hand, He saith unto her, Talitha, cumi, which is, being interpreted, Damsel, (I say unto thee) arise:
041	MAR	005	042	and immediately the damsel rose up and walked; for she was twelve years old; and they were struck with great astonishment.
041	MAR	005	043	And He strictly charged them, that no one should know it: and bid them give her something to eat.
041	MAR	006	001	And He went out from thence, and came into his own country, and his disciples attended Him:
041	MAR	006	002	and when the sabbath was come, He began to teach in the synagogue: and many that heard Him were astonished, and said, From whence hath He these things? and what is this wisdom which is given unto Him, that even such mighty things are done by his hands?
041	MAR	006	003	Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joses, and Judas, and Simon? and are not his sisters here among us? and they were prejudiced against Him.
041	MAR	006	004	But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is nowhere less honoured, than in his own country, and among his relations, and his own family.
041	MAR	006	005	And He could do no miracle there, only laying his hands on a few sick people He healed them;
041	MAR	006	006	and He was amazed at their unbelief. But he went about all the villages round, teaching.
041	MAR	006	007	And He calleth unto Him the twelve, and sent them forth two and two, and gave them power over impure spirits;
041	MAR	006	008	and ordered them to take nothing for their journey, but a staff only; no bag, nor bread, nor money in their purse:
041	MAR	006	009	but to tie on their sandals, and not to put on two coats.
041	MAR	006	010	And He said unto them, wheresoever ye enter into a house, there stay till ye leave that place.
041	MAR	006	011	And whosoever will not receive you, nor hear you, when ye depart thence, shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them. Verily I say unto you, it shall be more tolerable for Sodom or Gomorrah in the day of judgement, than for that city.
041	MAR	006	012	And they went forth, and preached that men should repent.
041	MAR	006	013	And they cast out many demons, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them.
041	MAR	006	014	And king Herod heard of Him, (for his name was spread abroad,) and he said, John the baptist is risen from the dead, and therefore miraculous powers appear in him.
041	MAR	006	015	Others said, it is Elias: and others said, it is a prophet, or like one of the prophets.
041	MAR	006	016	But when Herod heard of Him, he said, it is John whom I beheaded, he is risen from the dead.
041	MAR	006	017	For Herod had sent and seized John, and bound him in prison on account of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, because he had married her:
041	MAR	006	018	For John had said to Herod, it is not lawful for thee to have thy brother's wife.
041	MAR	006	019	Wherefore Herodias persecuted him, and would have taken away his life:
041	MAR	006	020	but could not; for Herod revered John, knowing him to be a just and holy man, and protected him: and when he heard him he did many things according to John's instructions, and heard him willingly.
041	MAR	006	021	But a convenient day happening, when Herod on his birth-night gave a supper to his lords, and chief officers, and persons of distinction in Galilee; and the daughter of Herodias coming in,
041	MAR	006	022	and dancing, and having pleased Herod and his guests, the king said to the young princess, Ask of me whatever thou wilt, and I will give it thee.
041	MAR	006	023	And he gave her his oath too, whatever thou shalt ask of me, I will give it thee, even to the half of my kingdom.
041	MAR	006	024	And she withdrew and consulted her mother, what to ask: and she said, The head of John the baptist.
041	MAR	006	025	And immediately she came in again with eagerness to the king, and said, I desire that thou wouldst give me directly the head of John the baptist in a dish.
041	MAR	006	026	And the king was exceedingly grieved, but on account of his oath, and those who were at table with him, he would not refuse her: but immediately sent one of his guard,
041	MAR	006	027	and ordered his head to be brought:
041	MAR	006	028	and he went and beheaded him in the prison, and brought his head in a dish, and gave it to the damsel, and the damsel carried it to her mother.
041	MAR	006	029	And his disciples hearing of it, came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a sepulchre.
041	MAR	006	030	And the apostles came together to Jesus, and told Him all things, both what they had done, and what they had taught.
041	MAR	006	031	And He said to them, Come ye yourselves apart into a retired place, and rest a little: for there were many coming and going, and they had not time even to eat.
041	MAR	006	032	And they went away privately in a ship into a desert place.
041	MAR	006	033	And the people saw them departing, and many took notice of them, and ran thither on foot from all the cities, and got before them, and came together unto Him.
041	MAR	006	034	And when Jesus came out of the ship, He saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion towards them; because they were as sheep without a shepherd: and He began to teach them many things.
041	MAR	006	035	And when it was now late in the day, his disciples came to Him, and said, this is a desert place, and it is now late:
041	MAR	006	036	dismiss them, that they may go into the country-places and villages round about, and buy themselves bread; for they have nothing to eat.
041	MAR	006	037	But He answered them, Do ye give them something to eat. And they say to Him, shall we go and buy two hundred penny-worth of bread, and give them to eat?
041	MAR	006	038	But He saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? go and see. And when they had examined, they said, Five, and two fishes.
041	MAR	006	039	And He ordered them to cause all the people to sit down by companies upon the grass:
041	MAR	006	040	and they sat down in an oblong square, an hundred by fifty.
041	MAR	006	041	And when He had taken the five loaves, and the two fishes, He looked up to heaven, and gave thanks; then He brake the loaves and gave them to his disciples, to set before them; the two fishes likewise He divided among them all.
041	MAR	006	042	And they did all eat and were fully satisfied.
041	MAR	006	043	And they took up of the fragments of the bread, and of the fishes, twelve baskets full.
041	MAR	006	044	And they that had eaten were about five thousand men.
041	MAR	006	045	And immediately He obliged his disciples to get into the ship, and to go before Him to the other side to Bethsaida, while he dismissed the people:
041	MAR	006	046	and when He had sent them away, He retired into a mountain to pray.
041	MAR	006	047	And when the evening was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and He alone upon the land:
041	MAR	006	048	and He saw them labouring in rowing; (for the wind was contrary:) and about the fourth watch of the night He cometh to them walking upon the sea, and would have passed by them.
041	MAR	006	049	But they seeing Him walking upon the water, thought it was an apparition, and cried out: for they all saw Him and were frighted.
041	MAR	006	050	And He immediately spake to them, and saith, Be of good courage, it is I, be not afraid.
041	MAR	006	051	And He went up into the ship to them, and the wind ceased, and they were exceedingly amazed in themselves, and wondered: not considering the miracle of the loaves,
041	MAR	006	052	for their heart was stupified.
041	MAR	006	053	And they passed over and came to the country of Gennesaret, and put to shore:
041	MAR	006	054	and when they came out of the ship, immediately the people knew Him, and ran through all the country,
041	MAR	006	055	and carried about in beds those that were sick, where they heard He was.
041	MAR	006	056	And wherever He came into their towns, or cities, or villages, they laid the sick in the streets, and intreated Him that they might but touch the border of his garment, and as many as touched it were healed.
041	MAR	007	001	And there were gathered unto Him the pharisees, and some of the scribes, from Jerusalem;
041	MAR	007	002	and when they saw some of his disciples eating with impure (that is, unwashed) hands, they found fault:
041	MAR	007	003	for the pharisees, and indeed all the Jews, do not eat till they have washed their hands thoroughly, observing the tradition of the ancients.
041	MAR	007	004	And when they come from the market, they do not eat till they have washed. And there are many other things, which they have received to observe, as the washing of cups, and pots, and brass-vessels, and seats.
041	MAR	007	005	Then the pharisees and the scribes ask Him, Why do not thy disciples walk according to the tradition of the ancients, but eat without washing their hands?
041	MAR	007	006	But He answered them, Well did Esaias prophesy concerning you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me:
041	MAR	007	007	and in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the injunctions of men.
041	MAR	007	008	For laying aside the commandment of God, ye retain the tradition of men, as the washings of pots and cups, and many other such like things.
041	MAR	007	009	And ye expressly annul the commandment of God, that ye may retain your own tradition;
041	MAR	007	010	for Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, He that revileth father or mother, let him be put to death:
041	MAR	007	011	but ye say, If a man tell his father or mother, That which thou mightest be profited by from me is Corban, (that is, a gift to the temple) it sufficeth:
041	MAR	007	012	and so ye allow him to do nothing more for his father or his mother:
041	MAR	007	013	making void the word of God by your tradition, And many such like things ye do.
041	MAR	007	014	And calling all the people to Him, He said unto them,
041	MAR	007	015	Hear me all of you, and understand, There is nothing without a man, which entring into him can defile him: but the things proceeding from him are those which defile a man.
041	MAR	007	016	If any one hath ears to hear, let him hear.
041	MAR	007	017	And when He was come into the house, away from the multitude, his disciples asked Him concerning the meaning of the parable.
041	MAR	007	018	And He saith unto them, Are ye so void of understanding also? Do ye not know, that whatsoever from without entreth into a man cannot defile him?
041	MAR	007	019	because it entreth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all his food.
041	MAR	007	020	But said He, What cometh out of a man, that defileth the man;
041	MAR	007	021	for out of the heart of men proceed evil thoughts,
041	MAR	007	022	adulteries, fornications, murthers, thefts, avarice, malice, deceit, lasciviousness, envy, slander, pride, folly;
041	MAR	007	023	all these evils come from within and defile the man.
041	MAR	007	024	And He arose and went from thence to the borders of Tyre and Sidon; and going into a house He would have had no body know it, but He could not be concealed: for a woman,
041	MAR	007	025	whose child was possessed by an evil spirit, having heard of Him, came and fell at his feet,
041	MAR	007	026	(now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation,) and she besought Him to cast out the demon from her daughter.
041	MAR	007	027	But Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be satisfied: for it is not fit to take the children's bread, and throw it to the dogs.
041	MAR	007	028	And she answered and said unto Him, True, Lord, yet the dogs under the table, eat of the children's crumbs.
041	MAR	007	029	And He said unto her, For this saying, go thy way, the demon is gone out of thy daughter.
041	MAR	007	030	And she went away to her house, and found the demon gone out, and her daughter laid on the bed.
041	MAR	007	031	And departing again out of the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, He came to the sea of Galilee thro' the midst of the coasts of Decapolis.
041	MAR	007	032	And they brought to Him a deaf man, who had likewise an impediment in his speech, and pray Him to put his hand upon him.
041	MAR	007	033	And He took him aside out of the croud, and He spit and put his fingers into his ears, and touched his tongue:
041	MAR	007	034	and looking up to heaven He sighed, and saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, be opened:
041	MAR	007	035	and immediately his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake distinctly.
041	MAR	007	036	And He charged them to tell no one, but the more He charged them, the more they published it:
041	MAR	007	037	and were exceedingly astonished, saying, He hath done all things well; he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.
041	MAR	008	001	In those days, there being again a very great multitude, and they having nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples to Him,
041	MAR	008	002	and saith unto them, I have compassion on the multitude, for they have now been with me three days, and have nothing to eat:
041	MAR	008	003	and if I send them away fasting to their own home, they will faint by the way; for some of them are come from far.
041	MAR	008	004	And his disciples answered Him, From whence can one satisfy these people with bread here in a desert?
041	MAR	008	005	And He asked them, How many loaves have ye? and they said, Seven.
041	MAR	008	006	And He ordered the people to sit down upon the ground: and taking the seven loaves, He gave thanks and brake them, and gave to his disciples to set before them; and they did set them before the multitude.
041	MAR	008	007	And they had a few small fishes: and He blessed them, and bid them set them also before the people.
041	MAR	008	008	And they did eat and were satisfied: and they took up what were left, to wit of fragments seven baskets:
041	MAR	008	009	and they that had eaten were about four thousand. And then He dismissed them.
041	MAR	008	010	And going directly on board a ship with his disciples, He came into the parts of Dalmanutha:
041	MAR	008	011	and the pharirisees came forth, and began to dispute with Him, desiring of Him a sign from heaven, tempting Him.
041	MAR	008	012	And He sighing deeply in his spirit, saith, Why doth this generation require a sign? Verily I tell you, There shall no sign be given to this generation.
041	MAR	008	013	So He left them, and went on board the ship again, and departed to the other side.
041	MAR	008	014	And his disciples had forgot to take bread, neither had they any more than one loaf with them in the ship.
041	MAR	008	015	And therefore as He was giving them a charge, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod,
041	MAR	008	016	they argued one with another, saying, It is because we have no bread.
041	MAR	008	017	And Jesus knowing it saith unto them, What are ye reasoning about? because ye have no bread? Do ye not yet discern nor understand? have ye your heart still hardened?
041	MAR	008	018	Have ye eyes, and do not see? and having ears, hear ye not? and do ye not remember?
041	MAR	008	019	When I brake the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments did ye take up? They answer, Twelve.
041	MAR	008	020	And when I divided the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? and they said, Seven.
041	MAR	008	021	And He said unto them, How is it then that ye do not understand?
041	MAR	008	022	Then He cometh to Bethsaida, where they brought to Him a blind man, and begged of Him that He would touch him.
041	MAR	008	023	And He took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town; and having spit on his eyes, He laid his hands upon him, and asked him, If he saw any thing.
041	MAR	008	024	And he looked up, and said, I see men (as it were trees) walking.
041	MAR	008	025	Then He put his hands again upon his eyes, and made him look up: and he was restored to sight, and saw them all plainly.
041	MAR	008	026	And He sent him away to his house, and said, Neither go into the town, nor tell any one in the town.
041	MAR	008	027	Then Jesus and his disciples went out into the towns of Cesarea Philippi: and by the way He asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I am?
041	MAR	008	028	And they answered, Some say, John the baptist; and others, Elias; and others, One of the prophets.
041	MAR	008	029	And He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? Peter answered and saith, Thou art the Christ.
041	MAR	008	030	And He charged them, that they should say this to no one concerning Him:
041	MAR	008	031	and began to tell them, that the Son of man must suffer much; and be rejected by the elders, and chief priests, and scribes; and be put to death: and after three days rise again.
041	MAR	008	032	And this He spake plainly and openly. Upon which Peter began to rebuke Him.
041	MAR	008	033	But He turned about and looking on his disciples reproved Peter, saying, Get thee behind me Satan; for thou savourest not the things of God, but the things that be of men.
041	MAR	008	034	And calling the people and his disciples to Him, He said unto them, Whosoever is willing to come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me:
041	MAR	008	035	for he that would save his life, shall lose it; but he that would lose his life for my sake and the gospel's, shall save it.
041	MAR	008	036	For what shall it profit a man, if he gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?
041	MAR	008	037	or what shall a man give as a ransom for his soul?
041	MAR	008	038	for whosoever shall be ashamed of me, and of my words, in this degenerate and sinful age, of him will the Son of man be also ashamed, when He cometh in the glory of his Father, with the holy angels.
041	MAR	009	001	And He said unto them, Verily I tell you, that there are some of those who stand here, that shall not taste of death, till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power.
041	MAR	009	002	And after six days Jesus taketh with Him Peter, and James, and John, and bringeth them up by themselves to a high mountain apart; and was transfigured before them:
041	MAR	009	003	and his raiment shone, being exceeding white as snow, so as no fuller on earth can whiten.
041	MAR	009	004	And there appeared unto them Elias with Moses, and they were talking with Jesus.
041	MAR	009	005	Then said Peter to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: let us make three tabernacles; one for Thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias:
041	MAR	009	006	for he knew not what to say, for they were sore afraid.
041	MAR	009	007	And there was a cloud overshadowing them, and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son, hear ye Him.
041	MAR	009	008	And immediately looking round about, they saw no more of any one, but Jesus alone with them.
041	MAR	009	009	And as they came down from the mountain, He charged them to tell no one what they had seen, till after the Son of man were risen from the dead.
041	MAR	009	010	And they laid hold on that expression, querying among themselves, what means the rising from the dead?
041	MAR	009	011	Then they asked Him, saying, Why do the scribes say, that Elias must come first?
041	MAR	009	012	And He answered and told them, Elias doth indeed come first, and settle all things: He told them likewise how it is written of the Son of man, that he must suffer many things and be used contemptuously.
041	MAR	009	013	But I tell you, that Elias is come, and they have done to him whatever they would, as it is written of him.
041	MAR	009	014	And when He came to the other disciples, He saw a great multitude about them, and the scribes disputing with them.
041	MAR	009	015	And immediately all the people, when they saw Him, were astonished; and running to Him, saluted Him.
041	MAR	009	016	And he asked the scribes, What are ye disputing about?
041	MAR	009	017	And one of the multitude answered, and said, Master I have brought unto thee my son, who is possessed by a dumb spirit:
041	MAR	009	018	and wherever it seizeth him, it convulseth him; and he fometh, and gnasheth his teeth, and thus he pineth away: and I desired thy disciples to cast him out, and they could not.
041	MAR	009	019	And He answered and said, O unbelieving generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I bear with you? bring him to me.
041	MAR	009	020	And they brought him to Him: and as soon as he saw Him, immediately the spirit threw him into convulsions: and he fell upon the ground, and rolled about foming.
041	MAR	009	021	And He asked his father, How long is it since this befel him? And he said, From a child.
041	MAR	009	022	And it has often thrown him both into the fire and into the waters to destroy him. But if thou canst do any thing, have compassion on us and help us.
041	MAR	009	023	And Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth.
041	MAR	009	024	And the father of the child immediately cried out and said with tears, Lord, I believe, help thou my unbelief.
041	MAR	009	025	when Jesus saw the people flock together, He rebuked the impure spirit, and said to him, Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I command thee, Come out of him, and enter no more into him.
041	MAR	009	026	And when he had rored and vehemently convulsed him, he came out of him: and the child was as one dead, so that many said, that he was dead.
041	MAR	009	027	But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up, and he arose.
041	MAR	009	028	And when He was come into the house, his disciples asked Him in private, Why could not we cast him out?
041	MAR	009	029	And He said unto them, This kind cannot be cast out, but by prayer and fasting.
041	MAR	009	030	And they departed from thence and passed through Galilee, and He was not willing that any should know it;
041	MAR	009	031	for He was instructing his disciples, and told them, the Son of man is going to be delivered into the hands of men, and they will put Him to death; and on the third day, after his being put to death, He will rise again.
041	MAR	009	032	But they knew not his meaning, and were afraid to ask Him.
041	MAR	009	033	And he came to Capernaum; and when He was in the house, He asked them, What were ye disputing about among yourselves by the way?
041	MAR	009	034	But they held their peace; for they had been disputing with each other by the way who should be the greatest.
041	MAR	009	035	So He sat down and called the twelve, and saith unto them, If any one would be first, let him be last of all, and servant of all.
041	MAR	009	036	And He took a child and set him in the midst of them, and taking him in his arms He said unto them,
041	MAR	009	037	Whoever shall receive one of these little children in my name, receiveth me; and whosoever receiveth me, receiveth not me only, but Him that sent me.
041	MAR	009	038	But John answered Him and said, Master, we saw one casting out demons in thy name, who doth not follow us; and we forbade him, because he followeth not us.
041	MAR	009	039	But Jesus said, Forbid him not: for there is no one, that worketh a miracle in my name, and can presently speak evil of me:
041	MAR	009	040	for he that is not against us, is for us.
041	MAR	009	041	For whosoever shall give you but a cup of water to drink, for my sake; because ye are Christ's, I assure you, he shall not lose his reward.
041	MAR	009	042	And whosoever shall cause one of these little ones, that believe in me, to offend, it were better for him, if a milstone were laid upon his neck, and he were cast into the sea.
041	MAR	009	043	And if thy hand cause thee to offend, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands, to go into hell, into the fire that will never be extinguished;
041	MAR	009	044	where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.
041	MAR	009	045	And if thy foot cause thee to offend, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter into life lame, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the inextinguishable fire;
041	MAR	009	046	where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.
041	MAR	009	047	And if thine eye cause thee to offend, cast it out: it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell-fire;
041	MAR	009	048	where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.
041	MAR	009	049	For every one shall be as it were salted by fire, and every sacrifice shall be seasoned as with salt.
041	MAR	009	050	Salt is useful, but if the salt become insipid, wherewith will ye season it? Have salt therefore in yourselves, and as a proof of it be at peace one with another.
041	MAR	010	001	And He arose from thence and came into the coasts of Judea, through the country beyond Jordan: and the people resorted to Him again; and, as He was wont, He taught them again.
041	MAR	010	002	And the pharisees came to Him and asked Him, "if it were lawful for a man to put away his wife," tempting Him.
041	MAR	010	003	And he answered and said unto them, What did Moses command you?
041	MAR	010	004	And they said, Moses permitted a man to write a bill of divorce, and to put her away.
041	MAR	010	005	And Jesus replied, He wrote this precept on account of your cruel tempers:
041	MAR	010	006	but from the beginning of the world, God created them male and female.
041	MAR	010	007	For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother,
041	MAR	010	008	and be joined to his wife, and they two shall be one flesh: so that they are no longer two, but one flesh.
041	MAR	010	009	Therefore let not man separate what God hath joined together.
041	MAR	010	010	And when they were in the house his disciples asked Him again about it:
041	MAR	010	011	and He told them, Whoever putteth away his wife and marrieth another, committeth adultery against her.
041	MAR	010	012	And if a woman be divorced from her husband, and be married to another, she committeth adultery.
041	MAR	010	013	And they brought to Him little children that He might touch them: and the disciples rebuked those that brought them.
041	MAR	010	014	Which Jesus observing, was much displeased, and said to them, Let the children come to me; and hinder them not; for of such is the kingdom of God.
041	MAR	010	015	Verily I tell you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, shall by no means enter into it.
041	MAR	010	016	And He took them in his arms, and put his hands upon them, and blessed them.
041	MAR	010	017	And as he went out into the way, there came one running and kneeling to Him, and asked Him, Good master, what shall I do, that I may inherit eternal life?
041	MAR	010	018	And Jesus said unto him, Why dost thou call me good? there is none good, but one, that is God.
041	MAR	010	019	Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Do not defraud, Honour thy father and thy mother.
041	MAR	010	020	And he answered and said unto Him, Master, all these have I kept from my youth.
041	MAR	010	021	Then Jesus looked upon him with affection, and said to him, One thing thou wantest; go, sell all that thou hast, and give it to the poor; and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come, take up the cross and follow me.
041	MAR	010	022	But he was sad at that saying, and went away sorrowful; for he had great possessions.
041	MAR	010	023	And Jesus looking round about saith to his disciples, How difficultly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!
041	MAR	010	024	And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus repeating it, saith unto them, Children, how hard is it for them, that trust in riches, to enter into the kingdom of God!
041	MAR	010	025	It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
041	MAR	010	026	And they were exceedingly amazed, saying one to another, Who then can be saved?
041	MAR	010	027	But Jesus looking upon them saith, With men it is impossible, but not with God; for with God all things are possible.
041	MAR	010	028	Then Peter said to Him, Behold we have left all, and followed thee.
041	MAR	010	029	And Jesus answered and said, Verily I tell you, there is no one that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children,
041	MAR	010	030	or lands for my sake and the gospel's, but he shall receive an hundred-fold: now in this time indeed, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands with persecutions; but in the world to come life everlasting.
041	MAR	010	031	But many that are first shall be last, and the last first.
041	MAR	010	032	And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus went before them: and they were amazed at it, and afraid to follow Him. And again taking the twelve aside, He began to tell them what things should befal Him,
041	MAR	010	033	saying, Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man shall be delivered to the chief priests, and the scribes, and they will condemn Him to death, and deliver Him to the Gentiles;
041	MAR	010	034	and they will insult Him, and scourge Him, and spit upon Him, and put Him to death: but on the third day He shall rise again.
041	MAR	010	035	Then come to Him James and John, the sons of Zebedee, saying, Master, we desire that thou wouldest do for us what we shall request:
041	MAR	010	036	and He said to them, What do ye desire me to do for you?
041	MAR	010	037	they said unto Him, Grant that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left, in thy glory.
041	MAR	010	038	But Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask. Can ye drink of the cup, that I drink of? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?
041	MAR	010	039	And they said, We can. And Jesus said unto them, The cup indeed which I drink, ye shall drink of; and with the baptism, that I am baptized with, shall ye be baptized:
041	MAR	010	040	but to sit on my right hand and on my left, is not mine to give, but for whom it is prepared.
041	MAR	010	041	And when the other ten heard it, they were provoked at James and John.
041	MAR	010	042	But Jesus called them to Him, and said unto them, Ye know that those who rule among the Gentiles, lord it over them, and their grandees exercise authority upon them.
041	MAR	010	043	But it shall not be so among you: but whoever would be great among you shall be your minister;
041	MAR	010	044	and whoever of you would be first shall be servant of all.
041	MAR	010	045	For the Son of man came not to be ministred unto, but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many.
041	MAR	010	046	And they came to Jericho: and as He was going out of Jericho, with his disciples and a great multitude, blind Bartimeus, the son of Timeus, sat by the way-side begging.
041	MAR	010	047	And hearing that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me.
041	MAR	010	048	And many rebuked him, that he might hold his peace: but he cried out so much the more, Thou son of David, have pity on me.
041	MAR	010	049	And Jesus stopt, and ordered him to be called: so they called the blind man, and said to him, Be of good courage, rise up, He calleth thee.
041	MAR	010	050	And he threw off his outer garment, and arose, and came to Jesus.
041	MAR	010	051	And Jesus said to him, What dost thou desire that I should do for thee? And the blind man said to Him, Lord, that I may recover my sight.
041	MAR	010	052	And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way, thy faith has cured thee. And he immediately recovered his sight, and followed Jesus in the way.
041	MAR	011	001	And when they came near to Jerusalem, even to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount of Olives, He sendeth two of his disciples,
041	MAR	011	002	and saith to them, Go into the village over against you, and as soon as ye enter into it, ye will find a colt tied, on which no man hath yet sat; loose him, and bring him to me.
041	MAR	011	003	And if any one say to you, Why do ye so? tell him, that the Lord hath need of it, and he will immediately send it hither.
041	MAR	011	004	And they went and found the colt tied at a door abroad, where two ways met, and they untied it.
041	MAR	011	005	And some of the people that stood there, said to them, What do ye mean by untying the colt?
041	MAR	011	006	And they answered them as Jesus had ordered, and they permitted them.
041	MAR	011	007	So they brought the colt to Jesus, and laid their garments on it, and He sat upon it.
041	MAR	011	008	And many spread their clothes in the way; and others cut off branches from the trees, and strewed them in the way.
041	MAR	011	009	And they that went before, and they that followed, cried out, saying, Hosanna, blessed be He that cometh in the name of the Lord:
041	MAR	011	010	blessed be the kingdom of our father David, that is coming in the name of the Lord, Hosanna in the highest.
041	MAR	011	011	And Jesus went into Jerusalem, and into the temple; and when He had looked round upon every thing, it being now late in the day, He went out to Bethany with the twelve.
041	MAR	011	012	And on the morrow, as they came from Bethany, He was hungry:
041	MAR	011	013	and seeing a fig-tree at a distance, with leaves, He went to see if He might find any thing upon it; and when He came to it, He found nothing but leaves; (for the time of gathering figs was not yet come:) And Jesus spake and said unto it,
041	MAR	011	014	Let no one ever eat fruit of thee hereafter. And his disciples heard it.
041	MAR	011	015	Then they came to Jerusalem: and Jesus went into the temple, and began to turn out those that sold and bought in the court of the temple, and threw down the tables of the money-changers, and the seats of them that sold doves:
041	MAR	011	016	and suffered not any one to carry a burthen through the courts of the temple.
041	MAR	011	017	And He taught them, saying, Is it not written, my house shall be called an house of prayer for all nations? But ye have made it a den of thieves.
041	MAR	011	018	And the scribes and chief priests heard it, and sought how to destroy Him; for they feared Him, because all the people were struck with his doctrine.
041	MAR	011	019	And when it was evening, He went out of the city.
041	MAR	011	020	And in the morning, as they were passing by it, they saw the fig-tree withered from the roots.
041	MAR	011	021	And Peter remembring the tree, saith unto Him, Master, behold, the fig-tree which thou cursedst, is withered.
041	MAR	011	022	And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God: for verily I tell you,
041	MAR	011	023	that whosoever shall say to this mountain, "Be thou removed and cast into the sea," and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that what he saith shall be done, he shall have whatsoever he saith.
041	MAR	011	024	Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye ask in prayer, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.
041	MAR	011	025	But when ye pray, forgive, if ye have any thing against any one, that your heavenly Father may also forgive you your trespasses:
041	MAR	011	026	but if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father in heaven forgive you your trespasses.
041	MAR	011	027	And they come again to Jerusalem, and as He was walking in the temple, the chief priests, and scribes, and elders come to Him,
041	MAR	011	028	and ask Him, By what authority dost thou these things, and who gave thee this authority, to do thus?
041	MAR	011	029	But Jesus said to them, I also will ask you one question; answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.
041	MAR	011	030	The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or from men? answer me.
041	MAR	011	031	And they reasoned among themselves, saying, If we say, from heaven; He will say, why then did ye not believe him?
041	MAR	011	032	but if we should say, from men --- they feared the people: (for they they all thought that John was a prophet indeed:)
041	MAR	011	033	and they answered and said unto Jesus, We cannot tell. And Jesus replied and said unto them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.
041	MAR	012	001	And He began to speak unto them in parables. A certain man planted a vineyard, and made a fence about it, and digged a place for the wine-fat, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and travelled abroad.
041	MAR	012	002	And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that he might receive from them of the fruit of the vineyard:
041	MAR	012	003	and they took him and beat him, and sent him away empty.
041	MAR	012	004	And again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they threw stones, and wounded him on the head, and sent him away shamefully used.
041	MAR	012	005	And again, he sent another; and him they killed: and many others, beating some, and killing others.
041	MAR	012	006	Having yet therefore one Son, his beloved, he sent him also at last unto them, saying, they will reverence my Son.
041	MAR	012	007	But the husbandmen said to one another, this is the heir, Come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.
041	MAR	012	008	And they took him, and killed Him too, casting him out of the vineyard.
041	MAR	012	009	What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy those husbandmen, and will let the vineyard to others.
041	MAR	012	010	And have ye not read this scripture, "The stone, which the builders refused, is become the head of the corner:
041	MAR	012	011	this was from the Lord, and it is marvellous in our eyes."
041	MAR	012	012	And they sought to lay hands on Him, but they were afraid of the people; (for they knew that He spake the parable against them) and they left Him, and went away.
041	MAR	012	013	And they send to Him some of the pharisees, and of the Herodians to insnare Him in his discourse:
041	MAR	012	014	and these, when they came, said to Him, Master, we know that thou art a man of truth, and carest for no man; for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to pay tribute to Cesar, or not? should we give, or should we not give?
041	MAR	012	015	But He knew their hypocrisy, and said to them, Why do ye tempt me? bring me a penny, that I may see it.
041	MAR	012	016	So they brought one: and He saith to them, Whose is this image and inscription? And they said Cesar's.
041	MAR	012	017	And Jesus answered and said unto them, Render then unto Cesar the things that are Cesar's, and to God the things that are God's. And they marvelled at Him.
041	MAR	012	018	Then come the sadducees to Him, who say there is no resurrection;
041	MAR	012	019	and they asked Him, saying, Master, Moses, in his writings tells us, if any one's brother die, and leave a wife, and leave no children, that his brother shall take his wife, and raise up seed to his brother.
041	MAR	012	020	Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife and died and left no seed;
041	MAR	012	021	and the second took her, and died, and he left no seed neither; and the third likewise.
041	MAR	012	022	And all the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all died the woman also.
041	MAR	012	023	In the resurrection therefore, when they rise again, whose wife shall be of them; for all the seven had her to wife?
041	MAR	012	024	And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, nor the power of God?
041	MAR	012	025	For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels in heaven.
041	MAR	012	026	But as to the dead, that they are raised, have ye not read in the book of Moses, how God spake to him in the bush, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?
041	MAR	012	027	He is not the God of the dead, but of the living: therefore ye do greatly mistake.
041	MAR	012	028	And one of the scribes, who heard them disputing, seeing that He answered them well, came to Him and asked Him, Which is the chief commandment of all?
041	MAR	012	029	And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is, "Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is the one Lord,
041	MAR	012	030	and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength:" this is the first or chief commandment,
041	MAR	012	031	and the second is like it, even this, "Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself:" there is no other commandment greater than these.
041	MAR	012	032	And the scribe said unto Him, Truly, Master, thou hast spoke exceeding well; for there is one God, and there is no other beside Him.
041	MAR	012	033	And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbour as himself, is more than all whole-burnt-offerings and sacrifices.
041	MAR	012	034	And Jesus seeing that he answered discreetly, said to him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no one dared any more to put questions to Him.
041	MAR	012	035	And Jesus spake and said, as He was teaching in the temple, How do the scribes say, that the Christ is the son of David?
041	MAR	012	036	for David himself said by the holy Spirit, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand till I make thine enemies thy footstool.
041	MAR	012	037	So that David himself calleth Him Lord: how then is He his son? And many of the people heard Him with pleasure.
041	MAR	012	038	And He said unto them as He was teaching them, Beware of the scribes, who love to walk in long robes, and salutations in public-places,
041	MAR	012	039	and the chief seats in the synagogues, and uppermost places at feasts;
041	MAR	012	040	who devour widows houses, and for a shew of religion make long prayers: these shall receive the heavier judgement.
041	MAR	012	041	And as Jesus was sitting over against the treasury, He saw how the people threw money into the treasury, and many of the rich put in much;
041	MAR	012	042	and there came a poor widow and put in two mites, that is, a farthing.
041	MAR	012	043	And He called his disciples to Him, and saith unto them, Verily I tell you, that this poor widow has given more than all those who have cast into the treasury.
041	MAR	012	044	For they all have contributed out of their abundance: but she out of her penury hath given all that she had, even her whole living.
041	MAR	013	001	And as He was going out of the temple, one of his disciples saith to Him, Master, behold what fine stones are here, and what stately buildings!
041	MAR	013	002	And Jesus answering said unto him, Thou seest these grand buildings: but there shall not be left one stone upon another, which shall not be thrown down.
041	MAR	013	003	And as He was sitting on the mount of Olives over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked Him privately,
041	MAR	013	004	saying, Tell us when these things shall be, and what shall be the sign when all these things are to be accomplished.
041	MAR	013	005	But Jesus answered them and said, Beware least any one deceive you:
041	MAR	013	006	for many shall come in my name saying, I am the Christ, and shall deceive many.
041	MAR	013	007	And when ye hear of wars, and rumors of wars, be not troubled; for such things must happen; but the end will not be yet.
041	MAR	013	008	For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and famines and troubles: these will be the beginnings of sorrows.
041	MAR	013	009	But look to yourselves; for they will deliver you up to councils, and synagogues: and ye shall be scourged, and set before governors and kings on my account, for a testimony against them.
041	MAR	013	010	And the gospel must first be published to all nations.
041	MAR	013	011	But when they shall lead you to deliver you up, be not anxiously careful beforehand what ye shall speak, neither premeditate: but whatever shall be suggested to you at that very time, this speak: for it is not you that speak, but the holy Spirit.
041	MAR	013	012	One brother shall betray another to death, and the father the son: and children shall appear against their parents, and cause them to be put to death.
041	MAR	013	013	And ye shall be hated by all men for my sake: but he that endures to the end shall be saved.
041	MAR	013	014	Now when ye shall see the desolating abomination, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, set up where it ought not to be, (let him that readeth, attend) then let those in Judea flee to the mountains:
041	MAR	013	015	and let not him that is at the top of the house come down into the house, nor go in to fetch any thing out of his house:
041	MAR	013	016	nor let him that is in the field return back for his clothes.
041	MAR	013	017	But wo to them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days.
041	MAR	013	018	But pray that your flight may not be in the winter;
041	MAR	013	019	for in those days shall be such affliction as never was from the beginning of the world, unto this day, nor ever shall be.
041	MAR	013	020	And if the Lord did not shorten those days, none could escape: but for the sake of the elect, whom He hath chosen, He hath shortened those days.
041	MAR	013	021	And then if any shall say to you, Behold, here is the Christ, or, Behold, He is there, believe it not:
041	MAR	013	022	for there shall rise up false Christs, and false prophets, who shall work signs and wonders, to seduce, if possible, even the elect.
041	MAR	013	023	But do ye beware: behold, I have told you all before.
041	MAR	013	024	But in those days, after that affliction, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give it's light; and the stars of heaven shall fall,
041	MAR	013	025	and the powers in the heavens shall be shaken;
041	MAR	013	026	and then shall they see the Son of man coming in clouds, with great power and glory.
041	MAR	013	027	And He will then send forth his messengers, and will gather his elect together from the four winds, from the end of the earth to the end of heaven.
041	MAR	013	028	Now learn a parable from the fig-tree: when it's branch is tender and bringeth forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh;
041	MAR	013	029	so ye also, when ye see these things come to pass, know that He is near, even at the doors.
041	MAR	013	030	Verily I tell you, that this generation shall not pass away until all these things be fulfilled.
041	MAR	013	031	Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words cannot pass away.
041	MAR	013	032	But of THAT day and hour knoweth no one, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but the Father only.
041	MAR	013	033	Take heed therefore, watch and pray; for ye know not when the time is:
041	MAR	013	034	as a man travelling abroad, who left his house, and gave charge to his servants, to each his work, and bid the porter be watchful.
041	MAR	013	035	Watch ye therefore; for ye know not when the master of the house cometh: (in the evening, or at midnight, or at the cock-crowing, or in the morning:)
041	MAR	013	036	least coming on a sudden he should find you sleeping.
041	MAR	013	037	And what I say to you, I say to all, Watch.
041	MAR	014	001	Now the feast of the passover and unleavened bread was within two days: and the chief priests and the scribes were contriving how they might seize Him by treachery and put Him to death.
041	MAR	014	002	But they said, Not on the feast-day, least there be a tumult of the people.
041	MAR	014	003	And when He was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as He was at table, there came a woman with an alabaster-box of ointment of spikenard, very valuable; and she brake the box and poured it on his head.
041	MAR	014	004	And there were some provoked at it and said, Why was this waste made of the ointment?
041	MAR	014	005	For it might have been sold for above three hundred pence, and given to the poor. And they inveighed against her.
041	MAR	014	006	But Jesus said, Let her alone, why do ye give her uneasiness?
041	MAR	014	007	She has done a kind office to me. For ye have the poor always with you, and may do them good, whenever ye will; but me ye have not always.
041	MAR	014	008	She has done what she could: she has embalmed my body beforehand against the burial.
041	MAR	014	009	Verily I tell you, wheresoever this gospel is preached, through all the world, what she hath done shall also be told for a memorial of her.
041	MAR	014	010	And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went to the chief priests, in order to betray Him unto them.
041	MAR	014	011	And they were glad, when they heard it, and engaged to give him money. And he sought to betray Him at a proper season.
041	MAR	014	012	And on the first day of the feast of unleavened bread, when they sacrificed the paschal lamb, his disciples said to Him, Where wouldst thou have us go and make preparation for thee to eat of the paschal lamb?
041	MAR	014	013	And He sendeth two of his disciples, and saith unto them, Go into the city, and there will meet you a man carrying a pitcher of water:
041	MAR	014	014	follow him, and where he goes in, say to the man of the house, The master inquireth, Where is the room, in which I may eat the passover with my disciples?
041	MAR	014	015	And he will shew you a large upper room ready prepared, there make preparation for us.
041	MAR	014	016	And his disciples went out, and came into the city, and found every thing as He told them; and so prepared the passover.
041	MAR	014	017	And in the evening He cometh with the rest of the twelve.
041	MAR	014	018	And when they were sat down and eating together, Jesus said, Verily I tell you, that one of you will betray me, who is now eating with me.
041	MAR	014	019	And they were grieved, and said to Him one by one, Is it I?
041	MAR	014	020	Is it I? And He said unto them, It is one of the twelve, that is now dipping with me in the dish.
041	MAR	014	021	The Son of man is going indeed as it is written concerning Him; but wo to that man by whom He is betrayed; it had been good for him, if that man had never been born.
041	MAR	014	022	And as they were at table, Jesus took bread, and when He had blessed it He brake it, and gave it to them, and said, Take, eat, This is my body:
041	MAR	014	023	and He took the cup, and when He had given thanks, He gave it to them: and they all drank of it.
041	MAR	014	024	And He said unto them, This is an emblem of my blood the seal of the new covenant, which is to be shed for many:
041	MAR	014	025	and I assure you, that I will not drink again of the fruit of the vine, till the day when I shall drink it new in the kingdom of God.
041	MAR	014	026	And when they had sung an hymn, they went out to the mount of Olives.
041	MAR	014	027	And Jesus saith unto them, Ye will all of you be made to offend on my account this night; for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered:
041	MAR	014	028	but after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.
041	MAR	014	029	But Peter said to Him, though all should be made to offend, yet will not I.
041	MAR	014	030	And Jesus saith unto him, Verily I tell thee, that to day, even in this very night, before the cock crow twice thou wilt deny me thrice.
041	MAR	014	031	But he said with the more vehemence, Though I should die with thee, I will never disown thee. And so likewise said they all.
041	MAR	014	032	And they came to a place called Gethsemane, and He saith to his disciples, Sit here whilst I go and pray.
041	MAR	014	033	And He taketh Peter and James and John with Him, and He began to be overwhelmed with terror and anguish.
041	MAR	014	034	And He saith unto them, My Soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death, stay here and watch.
041	MAR	014	035	And going a little farther, He prostrated Himself, and prayed, if it were possible, that this hour might pass from Him.
041	MAR	014	036	And He said, Abba, Father, all things are possible to Thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless, not what I will, but what thou wilt.
041	MAR	014	037	And He cometh and findeth them asleep, and saith to Peter, Simon, art thou sleeping? couldst thou not watch one hour?
041	MAR	014	038	Watch, and pray, that ye enter not into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the body is weak.
041	MAR	014	039	And He went away again, and prayed, after the same manner.
041	MAR	014	040	And when He returned, He found them again sleeping, for their eyes were heavy; and they knew not what to say to Him.
041	MAR	014	041	And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Are ye sleeping still and taking your rest? It is enough, the hour is come: behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
041	MAR	014	042	Rise, let us go; see the traitor is at hand.
041	MAR	014	043	And immediately while He was yet speaking cometh Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests, and scribes, and elders:
041	MAR	014	044	(Now the traitor had given them a sign, saying, The man, whom I shall kiss, is He; lay hold of Him and lead Him away safely:)
041	MAR	014	045	and as soon as he came, he went directly up to Him and said, Master, Master; and kissed Him.
041	MAR	014	046	And they laid their hands on Him, and apprehended Him.
041	MAR	014	047	And one of those that were present, drawing a sword, struck at the high priest's servant, and took off his ear.
041	MAR	014	048	And Jesus said unto them, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and clubs to take me?
041	MAR	014	049	I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye did not seize me: but this is done that the scriptures may be fulfilled.
041	MAR	014	050	And the disciples all forsook Him and fled: but there followed Him a certain youth,
041	MAR	014	051	who had only a linen cloth wrapt about him, and the young men laid hold on him;
041	MAR	014	052	and he let go the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.
041	MAR	014	053	And they led Jesus away to the high priest, with whom were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes.
041	MAR	014	054	And Peter followed Him at a distance, even into the palace of the high priest: and sat down among the servants, and warmed himself at the fire.
041	MAR	014	055	Now the chief priests and all the council sought for evidence against Jesus, to put Him to death, and found none:
041	MAR	014	056	for many bare false witness against Him, and the evidences did not agree.
041	MAR	014	057	At last there rose up some and bare false witness against Him,
041	MAR	014	058	saying, We heard Him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will build another made without hands:
041	MAR	014	059	but neither was their evidence consistent.
041	MAR	014	060	Then the high priest stood up in the midst and asked Jesus saying, Answerest thou nothing? what do these men witness against thee?
041	MAR	014	061	but he held his peace, and made him no answer. So the high priest asked Him again, and saith to Him, Art thou the Messiah the Son of the blessed God?
041	MAR	014	062	And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.
041	MAR	014	063	Then the high priest rent his clothes and said, What farther need have we of witnesses?
041	MAR	014	064	ye have heard the blasphemy; what think ye? and they all condemned Him as worthy of death.
041	MAR	014	065	And they spit upon Him, and blind-folded Him, and then buffeted Him and said to Him, prophesy who it was: and the officers struck him with their rods.
041	MAR	014	066	And Peter being in the hall below, there came one of the maid-servants of the high priest;
041	MAR	014	067	and when she saw Peter as he was warming himself, she looked earnestly upon him and said, Thou also wast with Jesus the Nazarene:
041	MAR	014	068	but he denied it, saying, I do not know Him, nor do I understand what thou meanest. And he went out into the porch, and the cock crew.
041	MAR	014	069	And the maid seeing him again said to them that stood by, This is one of them: and he denied it again.
041	MAR	014	070	And a little after, they that stood by, said to Peter again, Thou art certainly one of them: for thou art a Galilean, and thy speech is like theirs.
041	MAR	014	071	But he began to curse and swear saying, I do not know this man of whom ye speak: And the cock crowed a second time.
041	MAR	014	072	Then Peter called to mind the word which Jesus had said to him, Before the cock crow twice thou wilt deny me thrice. And he covered his face and wept.
041	MAR	015	001	And as soon as ever it was light the chief priests holding a consultation with the elders and scribes, they and the whole sanhedrim, bound Jesus, and carried Him away, and delivered Him to Pilate.
041	MAR	015	002	And Pilate asked Him, Art thou the king of the Jews? and He answered It is as thou sayst.
041	MAR	015	003	And the chief priests accused Him of many things: but he answered nothing.
041	MAR	015	004	So Pilate asked Him again, saying, Dost thou answer nothing? See how many things they witness against thee:
041	MAR	015	005	but Jesus still answered nothing, so that Pilate was amazed.
041	MAR	015	006	Now at the feast he used to release to them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired:
041	MAR	015	007	and there was one Barabbas under confinement with some of his accomplices in sedition, who had committed murder in the insurrection.
041	MAR	015	008	And the people clamoured and desired him to do as he always used to do for them.
041	MAR	015	009	But Pilate answered them, saying, Would ye have me release to you the king of the Jews?
041	MAR	015	010	(for he knew that the chief priests had delivered Him up to him out of envy:)
041	MAR	015	011	but the chief priests incited the people to desire that he would rather release Barabbas to them.
041	MAR	015	012	And Pilate answered, and said to them again, What then would you have me do with Him, whom ye call king of the Jews?
041	MAR	015	013	And they cried out again, Crucify Him.
041	MAR	015	014	But Pilate said unto them, Why, what ill has He done? And they cried out the more vehemently, Crucify Him.
041	MAR	015	015	So Pilate being willing to ingratiate with the multitude, released Barabbas to them, and having scourged Jesus, delivered Him up to be crucified.
041	MAR	015	016	And the soldiers led Him away into the hall, which is called the Pretorium; and gathered their whole company together:
041	MAR	015	017	and they clad Him in purple, and platted a crown of thorns and put it on his head,
041	MAR	015	018	and saluted Him, saying, Hail king of the Jews;
041	MAR	015	019	and struck Him on the head with a reed, and spit upon Him, and bowed their knees, and did Him homage.
041	MAR	015	020	And when they had thus abused Him, they took off the purple from Him, and put his own clothes on Him, and brought Him out to crucify Him.
041	MAR	015	021	And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, the father of Alexander and Rufus, as he was passing by, coming out of the country, to carry his cross:
041	MAR	015	022	and they brought Him to a place called Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, the place of a scull.
041	MAR	015	023	And they offered Him wine mingled with myrrh to drink, but He would not take it.
041	MAR	015	024	And when they had fastened Him to the cross, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what each of them should take.
041	MAR	015	025	And it was the third hour, when they fixed Him on the cross:
041	MAR	015	026	and the title of his charge was written over Him, THE KING OF THE JEWS.
041	MAR	015	027	And they crucified two thieves with Him, one on his right hand and one on his left:
041	MAR	015	028	so that the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, "And He was numbered with the transgressors."
041	MAR	015	029	And they that passed by reviled Him, shaking their heads and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest, the temple,
041	MAR	015	030	and buildest it in three days, save thyself and come down from the cross.
041	MAR	015	031	And the chief priests likewise scoffing at Him among themselves, with the scribes, said, He saved others, Himself He cannot save: let Christ,
041	MAR	015	032	the king of Israel, come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe in Him. And even they that were crucified with Him, reviled Him.
041	MAR	015	033	Now at the sixth hour there was darkness over the whole land, until the ninth hour.
041	MAR	015	034	And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani," which is being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?
041	MAR	015	035	And some of them that stood by hearing it, said, Behold He calleth upon Elias.
041	MAR	015	036	And there ran one, and filled a spunge with vinegar, and putting it on a reed offered it Him to drink, saying, Let Him alone, let us see whether Elias will come to take Him down.
041	MAR	015	037	But Jesus cried with a loud voice and expired.
041	MAR	015	038	And the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom.
041	MAR	015	039	And when the centurion, that stood over against Him, saw that He expired with such a cry, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.
041	MAR	015	040	There were also women at a distance looking on: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;
041	MAR	015	041	who also when He was in Galilee, followed Him and waited on Him: and several others who came up to Jerusalem with Him.
041	MAR	015	042	And the evening being now come, (because it was the preparation,
041	MAR	015	043	or the day before the sabbath,) Joseph of Arimathea, an honorable counsellor, who also was expecting the kingdom of God, came and went in boldly to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.
041	MAR	015	044	But Pilate wondered that He was dead already, and therefore calling for the centurion he asked him if He had been dead any time:
041	MAR	015	045	and when he heard it from the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph.
041	MAR	015	046	And he bought fine linen, and took Him down, and wrapped Him in the linen, and laid Him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock; and rolled a stone to the door of the sepulchre.
041	MAR	015	047	And Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of Joses observed where He was laid.
041	MAR	016	001	And when the sabbath was past Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, bought spices in order to come and embalm Him:
041	MAR	016	002	and very early in the morning of the first day of the week they come to the sepulchre at sun-rising.
041	MAR	016	003	And they said to one another, Who will roll away the stone for us from the door of the sepulchre?
041	MAR	016	004	(but when they looked up, they saw that the stone was rolled away,) for it was a very great one.
041	MAR	016	005	And they went into the sepulchre and saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white robe; and they were affrighted:
041	MAR	016	006	but he said to them, Be not affrighted, ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified, He is risen, He is not here, see the place where they laid Him.
041	MAR	016	007	But go, tell his disciples, and Peter particularly, that He is going before you into Galilee: there ye will see Him, as He told you.
041	MAR	016	008	And they hasted out and fled from the sepulchre; for they were seized with trembling and amazement: neither said they any thing to any one; for they were afraid.
041	MAR	016	009	(note: The most reliable and earliest manuscripts do not include Mark 16:9-20.) Now Jesus being risen early on the first day of the week appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom He had cast out seven devils:
041	MAR	016	010	and she went and told those that used to be with Him, who were mourning and weeping;
041	MAR	016	011	but they, though they heard that He was indeed alive, and had been seen by her, did not believe it.
041	MAR	016	012	After this He appeared in another form to two of them as they were walking, going into the country:
041	MAR	016	013	and they went and told the rest; but they did not believe them neither.
041	MAR	016	014	At last he appeared to the eleven as they were sitting at table, and upbraided them with their unbelief, and hardness of heart; because they did not believe those who had seen Him after He was risen.
041	MAR	016	015	And He said unto them, Go to all the world and preach the gospel to every one:
041	MAR	016	016	he that believeth and is baptized, shall be saved; but he that believeth not, shall be condemned.
041	MAR	016	017	And these signs shall accompany them that believe; in my name shall they cast out demons, they shall speak with new tongues;
041	MAR	016	018	they shall take up serpents, and if they should drink any thing poisonous, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall be well.
041	MAR	016	019	Now the Lord, after He had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God.
041	MAR	016	020	And they went forth and preached every where, the Lord co-operating with them, and confirming the word by miracles following upon it. Amen.

# BOOK	042	LUK	Luke	Luke
042	LUK	001	001	Whereas many have undertaken to compose a narrative of the things, which have been fully certified among us;
042	LUK	001	002	as they delivered them to us, who were from the beginning eye-witnesses of them, and ministers of the word;
042	LUK	001	003	it seemed good to me also, having thoroughly traced them all from the very first, to write an account of them in order to thee,
042	LUK	001	004	most excellent Theophilus, that thou mayst know the certainty of the things wherein thou hast been instructed.
042	LUK	001	005	There was in the days of Herod king of Judea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia; and his wife was of the family of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.
042	LUK	001	006	And they were both righteous in the sight of God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.
042	LUK	001	007	And they had no child, for Elisabeth was barren; and they were both far advanced in years.
042	LUK	001	008	And it came to pass, while he was in the order of his course performing the priest's office before God,
042	LUK	001	009	according to the custom of dividing the office of the priests, that it fell to his lot to burn incense, entring into the temple of the Lord:
042	LUK	001	010	and all the people were praying without at the time of offering incense.
042	LUK	001	011	And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord standing on the right hand of the altar of incense.
042	LUK	001	012	And when Zacharias saw him, he was startled and struck with fear:
042	LUK	001	013	but the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias; for thy prayer is heard, and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John:
042	LUK	001	014	and he shall be a joy and transport to thee, yea, many shall rejoice on account of his birth; for he shall be great in the sight of the Lord,
042	LUK	001	015	and he shall drink neither wine nor any other strong liquor; and he shall be filled with the holy Spirit even from his birth;
042	LUK	001	016	and many of the children of Israel shall he convert unto the Lord their God.
042	LUK	001	017	And he shall go before Him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers unto the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just, to prepare for the Lord a people well-disposed.
042	LUK	001	018	And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife far advanced in years.
042	LUK	001	019	And the angel answering said to him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God, and I am sent to speak to thee, and to tell thee this good news:
042	LUK	001	020	and now shalt thou be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall come to pass; because thou believedst not my words, which shall be fulfilled at their season.
042	LUK	001	021	And the people were waiting for Zacharias, and wondered at his staying so long in the temple:
042	LUK	001	022	but when he came out he could not speak to them, and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple; and he made signs to them, and continued speechless:
042	LUK	001	023	and as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house.
042	LUK	001	024	And after these days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and retired five months,
042	LUK	001	025	saying, the Lord hath thus dealt with me in the days wherein he looked upon me to take away my reproach among men.
042	LUK	001	026	But in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a city of Galilee called Nazareth,
042	LUK	001	027	to a virgin who was betrothed to a man, whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the name of the virgin was Mary.
042	LUK	001	028	And when the angel came in to the room to her, he said, Hail, thou that art highly favoured; the Lord is with thee;
042	LUK	001	029	blessed art thou among women! and when she saw him, she was confused at what he said, and pondered in her mind what sort of salutation this could be.
042	LUK	001	030	And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary; for thou hast found favor with God:
042	LUK	001	031	and behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and shalt bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS:
042	LUK	001	032	He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Most High, and the Lord God shall give Him the throne of David his father,
042	LUK	001	033	and He shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever, and of his kingdom there shall be no end.
042	LUK	001	034	Then said Mary to the angel, How can this be, since I am a virgin?
042	LUK	001	035	And the angel answered and said unto her, The holy Spirit shall come upon thee, and the power of the Most High shall overshadow thee, and therefore thine holy offspring shall be called the Son of God: and lo,
042	LUK	001	036	thy cousin Elisabeth also hath conceived a son in her old age, and this is the sixth month with her that was called barren;
042	LUK	001	037	for nothing is impossible with God.
042	LUK	001	038	Then Mary said, Behold the servant of the Lord, may it be unto me according to thy word. So the angel departed from her.
042	LUK	001	039	Then Mary arose and went with speed into the hill-country, to a city of Juda,
042	LUK	001	040	and came into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth.
042	LUK	001	041	And as soon as Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the child leaped in her womb, and Elisabeth was filled with the holy Spirit:
042	LUK	001	042	and she cried out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb:
042	LUK	001	043	and whence is this honor to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?
042	LUK	001	044	for behold, as soon as the voice of thy salutation reached my ears, the child in my womb leaped for joy:
042	LUK	001	045	and blessed is she that believed; for there shall be a performance of the things that were told her from the Lord.
042	LUK	001	046	And Mary said, "My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour;
042	LUK	001	047	for He hath regarded the low estate of his handmaid:
042	LUK	001	048	for behold, from henceforth shall all generations call me blessed:
042	LUK	001	049	for He that is mighty hath done great things for me,
042	LUK	001	050	and his name is holy, and his mercy is on them that fear Him, unto all generations.
042	LUK	001	051	He hath wrought powerfully with his arm; He hath confounded those that were proud in the imagination of their heart.
042	LUK	001	052	He hath cast down the mighty from their thrones, and exalted the humble.
042	LUK	001	053	He hath filled the hungry with good things, and the rich He hath sent away empty.
042	LUK	001	054	He hath supported Israel his servant,
042	LUK	001	055	in remembrance of his mercy (even as He promised to our fathers, to Abraham and to his seed,) for ever."
042	LUK	001	056	And Mary stayed with her about three months, and then returned to her own house.
042	LUK	001	057	Now when Elisabeth's time for her delivery was fully come, she brought forth a son:
042	LUK	001	058	and her neighbours and kindred heard that the Lord had magnified his mercy towards her, and they congratulated her;
042	LUK	001	059	and on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child: and they would have called him Zacharias, after the name of his father:
042	LUK	001	060	but his mother said, No, but he shall be called John:
042	LUK	001	061	and they said to her, There is none of thy relations of this name.
042	LUK	001	062	And they made signs to his father, what name he would have him called by.
042	LUK	001	063	And he called for a writing-tablet, and wrote upon it, His name is John: and they all wondered.
042	LUK	001	064	And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue loosed, and he spake and praised God.
042	LUK	001	065	And an awe fell upon all that dwelt round about them; and all these things were divulged through the whole hill-country of Judea.
042	LUK	001	066	And all that heard them, laid them up in their hearts, saying, What a child will this be? And the hand of the Lord was with him.
042	LUK	001	067	And his father Zacharias was filled with the holy Spirit,
042	LUK	001	068	and prophesied, saying, "Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, for He hath visited and wrought redemption for his people,
042	LUK	001	069	and hath raised up an horn of salvation for us,
042	LUK	001	070	in the house of his servant David, as He spake by the mouth of his holy prophets from the beginning,
042	LUK	001	071	even salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us,
042	LUK	001	072	to display his mercy towards our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant,
042	LUK	001	073	according to the oath which He sware to Abraham our father,
042	LUK	001	074	to grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies, might serve Him without fear, in holiness and righteousness before Him,
042	LUK	001	075	all the days of our life.
042	LUK	001	076	And thou, my child, shalt be called the prophet of the most High; for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord,
042	LUK	001	077	to make known salvation to his people,
042	LUK	001	078	in the remission of their sins, through the tender mercy of our God, whereby the day-spring hath visited us from on high,
042	LUK	001	079	to enlighten them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to direct our feet into the way of peace."
042	LUK	001	080	And the child grew, and became strong in spirit: and he was in the deserts till the time of his being manifested to Israel.
042	LUK	002	001	Now in those days an edict was published by Augustus Cesar, that all the world should be enrolled or taxed,
042	LUK	002	002	(this tax was first levied when Cyrenius was governor of Syria) and they all went to be enrolled,
042	LUK	002	003	every one to his own city:
042	LUK	002	004	so Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem (because he
042	LUK	002	005	was of the house and line of David) to be enrolled with Mary his espoused wife, who was big with child.
042	LUK	002	006	And while they were there, the days of her delivery were fulfilled,
042	LUK	002	007	and she brought forth her son, the first-born, and wrapped him in swaddling cloths, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.
042	LUK	002	008	And there were in the same country shepherds out in the fields, keeping watch over their flock by night: and lo,
042	LUK	002	009	an angel of the Lord stood over them, and the glory of the Lord shone round them, and they were greatly terrified:
042	LUK	002	010	and the angel said to them, Be not affrighted; for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people,
042	LUK	002	011	that this day is born, in the city of David, your Saviour Christ the Lord.
042	LUK	002	012	And this shall be a sign to you, Ye shall find the child wrapped in swaddling bands lying in a manger.
042	LUK	002	013	And on a sudden there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host,
042	LUK	002	014	praising God, and saying, Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good-will towards men.
042	LUK	002	015	And when the angels went from them into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, Let us go to Bethlehem, and see this which hath been told us, which the Lord hath made known unto us.
042	LUK	002	016	And they came with speed, and found both Mary and Joseph, and the child lying in the manger:
042	LUK	002	017	and when they had seen it, they divulged what had been told them concerning this child:
042	LUK	002	018	and all that heard it, were amazed at the things which were related to them by the shepherds.
042	LUK	002	019	But Mary treasured up all these words, pondering them in her heart.
042	LUK	002	020	And the shepherds returned glorifying and praising God for all the things which they had heard and seen, according as it had been told unto them.
042	LUK	002	021	And when eight days were fulfilled for the circumcising of the child, his name was called JESUS, having been so called by the angel before He was conceived in the womb.
042	LUK	002	022	And when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were fulfilled, they brought Him to Jerusalem to present Him before the Lord:
042	LUK	002	023	(as it is written in the law of the Lord, That every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord:) and to offer a sacrifice,
042	LUK	002	024	according to what is required in the law of the Lord, a pair of turtle-doves or two young pigeons.
042	LUK	002	025	And there was a man at Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon, and he was a just and a religious man, who expected the consolation of Israel; and the holy Spirit was upon him.
042	LUK	002	026	And it was revealed to him by the holy Spirit, that he should not die before he had seen the Anointed of the Lord.
042	LUK	002	027	And he came by the influence of the Spirit into the temple, as his parents brought in the child Jesus to do concerning Him according to the custom of the law:
042	LUK	002	028	and he took Him into his arms,
042	LUK	002	029	and blessed God, and said, "Now, Lord, thou dismissest thy servant in peace, according to thy word;
042	LUK	002	030	for mine eyes have seen thy salvation, which thou hast provided in the sight of all people,
042	LUK	002	031	a light for the enlightening of the Gentiles,
042	LUK	002	032	and the glory of thy people Israel."
042	LUK	002	033	And Joseph and his mother were amazed at the things that were spoken concerning Him.
042	LUK	002	034	And Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary his mother, Behold, this child is appointed for the fall and rising again of many in Israel, and for a sign which shall be spoken against,
042	LUK	002	035	(and a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also) that the thoughts of many hearts may be discovered.
042	LUK	002	036	And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser; who was of a great age, having lived with a husband seven years from her first marrying,
042	LUK	002	037	and had been a widow about eighty four years; who departed not from the temple; serving God with fastings and prayers night and day.
042	LUK	002	038	And coming in at the very same time, gave thanks unto the Lord, and spake of Him to all that were looking for redemption in Jerusalem.
042	LUK	002	039	And when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth.
042	LUK	002	040	And the child grew, and became strong in spirit, being filled with wisdom; and the grace of God was upon Him.
042	LUK	002	041	Now his parents went every year to Jerusalem at the feast of the passover:
042	LUK	002	042	and when He was twelve years old, going up to Jerusalem, as usual at the feast, and having finished the time,
042	LUK	002	043	when they returned, the child Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem: and Joseph and his mother did not know it;
042	LUK	002	044	but supposing Him to be in the company, went a day's journey, and then sought for Him among their kindred and acquaintance:
042	LUK	002	045	and not finding Him they returned to Jerusalem seeking for Him:
042	LUK	002	046	and after three days they found Him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, attending to them and asking them questions.
042	LUK	002	047	And all that heard Him were astonished at his understanding and his answers.
042	LUK	002	048	And when they saw Him, they were amazed. And his mother said to Him, Son, why didst thou deal thus with us? behold, thy father and I with grief have been seeking for thee.
042	LUK	002	049	And He said to them, Why did ye so seek me? Did not ye know that I ought to be in my Father's house?
042	LUK	002	050	but they did not understand the word which He spake to them.
042	LUK	002	051	Then He went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject to them. And his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.
042	LUK	002	052	And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men.
042	LUK	003	001	Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Cesar, when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, and Herod tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of Iturea and Trachonitis,
042	LUK	003	002	and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene, Annas and Caiaphas being high priests, the word of God came unto John the Son of Zacharias in the wilderness:
042	LUK	003	003	and he went into all the country about Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance in order to the remission of sins;
042	LUK	003	004	as it is written in the book of Esaias the prophet, saying, "The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight:
042	LUK	003	005	every valley shall be raised, and every mountain and hill shall be lowered, and the crooked ways shall be made straight, and the rough ways smooth:
042	LUK	003	006	and all men shall see the salvation of God."
042	LUK	003	007	Therefore said he to the multitudes that came to be baptised by him, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
042	LUK	003	008	Bring forth therefore fruits becoming penitents, and do not say within yourselves, "We have Abraham for our father," for I tell you that God can of these stones raise up children to Abraham.
042	LUK	003	009	And now the ax is laid to the root of the trees: every tree therefore which doth not yield good fruit, is cut down and cast into the fire.
042	LUK	003	010	And the people asked him, saying, What shall we do then?
042	LUK	003	011	And he saith unto them, Let him that hath two coats, give one to him that hath none, and let him that hath food do the like.
042	LUK	003	012	And there came publicans to be baptized, and said unto him, Master, what shall we do?
042	LUK	003	013	And He said unto them, Exact no more than what is appointed you.
042	LUK	003	014	And the soldiers also asked him, saying, And what shall we do? and He said unto them, Do violence to no man, neither accuse any falsely, and be content with your pay.
042	LUK	003	015	Now as the people were in suspense, and were all thinking in their hearts concerning John, whether he were the Christ or not,
042	LUK	003	016	John answered and said to them all, I indeed baptize you with water; but a mightier than I is coming, whose shoes I am not worthy to untie: He will baptize you with the holy Spirit, and with fire;
042	LUK	003	017	whose fan is in his hand, and He will thoroughly cleanse his floor, and will gather the wheat into his granary, but will burn up the chaff in unquenchable fire.
042	LUK	003	018	And many other things by way of exhortation did he preach unto the people.
042	LUK	003	019	But Herod the tetrarch being reproved by him on account of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, and for all the wicked things which Herod did,
042	LUK	003	020	added this likewise to all the rest, that he shut up John in prison.
042	LUK	003	021	Now, when all the people were baptized, and Jesus was baptized and praying,
042	LUK	003	022	the heaven was opened, and the holy Spirit descended in a corporeal form, like a dove upon Him, and there came a voice from heaven saying, Thou art my beloved Son, in thee I am well pleased.
042	LUK	003	023	And Jesus was then about thirty years of age, being (as was supposed) the son of Joseph, the son of Heli,
042	LUK	003	024	the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Melchi,
042	LUK	003	025	the son of Janna, the son of Joseph, the son of Mattathias, the son of Amos, the son of Naum, the son of Esli,
042	LUK	003	026	the son of Naggai, the son of Maath, the son of Mattathias, the son of Semei, the son of Joseph, the son of Juda,
042	LUK	003	027	the son of Joanna, the son of Rhesa, the son of Zorobabel, the son of Salathiel, the son of Neri, the son of Melchi,
042	LUK	003	028	the son of Addi, the son of Kosam, the son of Elmodam,
042	LUK	003	029	the son of Er, the son of Joses, the son of Eliezer, the son of Jorim, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi,
042	LUK	003	030	the son of Simeon, the son of Juda, the son of Joseph, the son of Jonan, the son of Eliakim,
042	LUK	003	031	the son of Melea, the son of Menan, the son of Mattatha,
042	LUK	003	032	the son of Nathan, the son of David, the son of Jesse, the son of Obed, the son of Booz, the son of Salmon,
042	LUK	003	033	the son of Naasson, the son of Aminadab, the son of Aram, the son of Esrom, the son of Phares,
042	LUK	003	034	the son of Juda, the son of Jacob, the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham, the son of Thara, the son of Nachor,
042	LUK	003	035	the son of Saruch, the son of Ragau, the son of Phalec, the son of Heber, the son of Sala, the son of Cainan,
042	LUK	003	036	the son of Arphaxad, the son of Sem, the son of Noe,
042	LUK	003	037	the son of Lamech, the son of Mathusala, the son of Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of Maleleel, the son of Cainan,
042	LUK	003	038	the son of Enos, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of GOD.
042	LUK	004	001	Now Jesus being full of the holy Spirit, returned from Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness, being forty days tempted by the devil;
042	LUK	004	002	and He did eat nothing in all those days: and when they were ended, at last He was hungry.
042	LUK	004	003	And the devil said to Him, If thou art the Son of God, command this stone to become bread.
042	LUK	004	004	And Jesus answered him, saying, It is written, that man shall not live by bread only, but on every word of God.
042	LUK	004	005	And the devil taking Him up into an high mountain, shewed Him all the kingdoms of the world in an instant,
042	LUK	004	006	and said to Him, All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them: for it is committed to me, and I give it to whomsoever I will.
042	LUK	004	007	Therefore, if thou wilt but worship me, they all shall be thine.
042	LUK	004	008	And Jesus answering him said with indignation, Get thee behind me, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve.
042	LUK	004	009	And he brought Him to Jerusalem, and set him on a battlement of the temple, and said to Him, If thou art the Son of God, cast thyself down from hence;
042	LUK	004	010	for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee,
042	LUK	004	011	to keep thee, and they shall bear thee up in their hands, least thou dash thy foot against a stone.
042	LUK	004	012	And Jesus answered him, it is said, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.
042	LUK	004	013	And when the devil had ended all the temptation, he departed from Him for a time.
042	LUK	004	014	And Jesus returned by the influence of the Spirit into Galilee: and a fame was spread through all the country round about concerning Him:
042	LUK	004	015	and He taught in their synagogues with universal applause.
042	LUK	004	016	And He came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up: and according to his custom He went into the synagogue on the sabbath-day, and stood up to read.
042	LUK	004	017	And there was delivered to Him the book of the prophet Esaias; and opening the book, He found the place where it was written,
042	LUK	004	018	"The spirit of the Lord is upon me to the end, for which He hath anointed me: He hath sent me to publish good tidings to the poor, to heal the broken-hearted, to proclaim deliverance to the captives, and recovery of sight to the blind, to release them that are bruised,
042	LUK	004	019	and to preach the acceptable year of the Lord."
042	LUK	004	020	And He folded up the book, and gave it again to the minister, and sat down: and the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed upon Him.
042	LUK	004	021	And He said unto them, this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears.
042	LUK	004	022	And they all bare witness to Him, and wondered at the gracefulness of the words, which proceeded from his mouth, and said, Is not this the son of Joseph?
042	LUK	004	023	And He said unto them, No doubt ye will apply to me this proverb, "Physician, cure thyself, and do here in thy own country what we have heard were done at Capernaum."
042	LUK	004	024	But, said He, indeed I must tell you, that no prophet is well received in his own country.
042	LUK	004	025	And I assure you, there were many widows in Israel, in the days of Elias, when the heaven was shut up for three years and six months, and there was a great famine through all the land;
042	LUK	004	026	but Elias was sent to none of those widows, but to a widow-woman at Sarepta in the territory of Sidon.
042	LUK	004	027	There were also many lepers in Israel, in the time of Elisha the prophet, and none of them was cleansed; but Naaman the Syrian was.
042	LUK	004	028	And all the synagogue were filled with rage, when they heard these things,
042	LUK	004	029	and they rose up and drove Him out of the city, and dragged Him to the brow of the hill, on which their city was built, in order to throw Him down the precipice.
042	LUK	004	030	But He passed through the midst of them, and went away.
042	LUK	004	031	And He came down to Capernaum a city of Galilee, and taught them on the sabbath-days,
042	LUK	004	032	and they were astonished at his doctrine; for He spake with authority.
042	LUK	004	033	And there was a man in the synagogue possessed by the spirit of an impure demon, and he cried out with a loud voice,
042	LUK	004	034	saying, Let us alone, what hast thou to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know who thou art, the holy one of God:
042	LUK	004	035	but Jesus rebuked him, saying, Be silent, and come out of him. And the demon threw him down in the midst of the assembly, and came out of him, having done him no hurt.
042	LUK	004	036	And they were all amazed, and said one to another, What a speech is this? for with authority and power He commandeth the impure spirits, and they come out!
042	LUK	004	037	And his fame spread all over the country round about.
042	LUK	004	038	And He rose up and went out of the synagogue, and came into the house of Simon: now Simon's wife's mother had a violent fever, and they intreated Him on her behalf.
042	LUK	004	039	And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever, and it left her: and immediately she arose and waited upon them.
042	LUK	004	040	And at sun-set all that had any persons sick of any diseases, brought them to Him: and He laid his hands on every one of them and healed them.
042	LUK	004	041	And demons also came out from many, crying out, Thou art the Messiah the Son of God. And He rebuked them, and suffered them not to say, that they knew Him to be the Christ.
042	LUK	004	042	And when the day was coming on, He went out and retired into a solitary place; and the people sought for Him, and came to Him, and would fain have detained Him, that He might not go from them.
042	LUK	004	043	But He said unto them, I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also: for therefore am I sent.
042	LUK	004	044	So He went on preaching in the synagogues of Galilee.
042	LUK	005	001	And when the people were pressing on Him to hear the word of God, as He stood by the lake of Gennesareth, seeing two vessels at the edge of the lake,
042	LUK	005	002	(but the fishermen were gone out of them, and were washing their nets:)
042	LUK	005	003	He went into one of them, which was Simon's, and desired him to put off a little way from the shore: and He sat down and taught the multitudes from the ship.
042	LUK	005	004	And when He had done speaking, He said to Simon, Put out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught.
042	LUK	005	005	And Simon answered and said unto Him, Master, we have been toiling all the night, and have caught nothing; however at thy word I will cast the net.
042	LUK	005	006	And when they had done this, they inclosed a multitude of fishes; and their net was breaking.
042	LUK	005	007	And they beckoned to their partners that were in the other ship, to come and help them; and they came, and filled both the ships, so that they were even sinking: and when Simon Peter saw it,
042	LUK	005	008	he fell at the knees of Jesus, saying, Lord, depart from me, for I am a sinful man;
042	LUK	005	009	for he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the draught of fishes which they had taken;
042	LUK	005	010	as were also James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, Be not afraid, from henceforth thou shalt be a captor of men.
042	LUK	005	011	And when they had brought their ships to land, they left all and followed Him.
042	LUK	005	012	And when He was in one of the cities of that country, behold a man full of leprosy: who seeing Jesus, fell prostrate to Him, and besought Him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst cleanse me.
042	LUK	005	013	And Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, I will; be thou cleansed: and immediately the leprosy departed from him.
042	LUK	005	014	And He charged him to tell no one: but go, said He, and shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing according as Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.
042	LUK	005	015	But the fame of Him spread more and more, and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by Him of their infirmities.
042	LUK	005	016	But He frequently retired into solitary places, and prayed.
042	LUK	005	017	And one day, as He was teaching, there were pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, who were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judea, and from Jerusalem; and the power of the Lord was present to heal the people:
042	LUK	005	018	and behold, some men bringing on a couch a man that was paralytic; and they endeavoured to bring him in, and lay him before Him:
042	LUK	005	019	but when they could not find what way to bring him in because of the croud, they went up on the battlements of the house, and let him down from the roof with his couch, into the midst before Jesus,
042	LUK	005	020	who seeing their faith said unto him, Man, thy sins are forgiven thee.
042	LUK	005	021	And the scribes and pharisees began to cavil, saying, Who is this that talketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God?
042	LUK	005	022	but Jesus knowing their thoughts, answered and said unto them, What are ye disputing in your hearts?
042	LUK	005	023	Which is easier, to say, Thy sins are forgiven thee, or to say, Rise up and walk?
042	LUK	005	024	but that ye may know, that the Son of man hath power even on earth to forgive sins, (He spake to the paralytic) I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy couch, and go to thine house.
042	LUK	005	025	And immediately he rose up before them, took up the bed on which he lay, and went away to his house, glorifying God.
042	LUK	005	026	And they were all amazed and glorified God, and were filled with awe, saying, we have seen wonderful things to-day.
042	LUK	005	027	After these things He went out and saw a publican named Levi, sitting at the custom-house, and said to him, Follow me:
042	LUK	005	028	and he left all, rose up, and followed Him.
042	LUK	005	029	And Levi made Him a great feast in his own house: and there was a great number of publicans, and others at table with them.
042	LUK	005	030	And their scribes and pharisees murmured at his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners?
042	LUK	005	031	And Jesus answered and said unto them, They that are in health have no need of a physician, but they that are sick: I am not come to call the righteous,
042	LUK	005	032	but sinners to repentance.
042	LUK	005	033	And they said unto Him, Why do the disciples of John frequently fast and pray, and likewise those of the pharisees; but thine eat and drink?
042	LUK	005	034	And He said unto them, Can ye make those of the bride-chamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them?
042	LUK	005	035	but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, then they will fast.
042	LUK	005	036	Then He spake a parable to them, That no one putteth a piece of new cloth upon an old garment: otherwise, the new maketh a rent, and doth not match the old:
042	LUK	005	037	nor doth any one put new wine in to old vessels; otherwise, the new wine will burst the casks, and be spilled, and the vessels will be destroyed:
042	LUK	005	038	but new wine must be put into new vessels, and then both are saved.
042	LUK	005	039	And no one that has been drinking old wine, immediately desireth new; for he saith, the old is better.
042	LUK	006	001	And it came to pass on the second-sabbath after the first, that as He was passing through the corn-fields, his disciples plucked the ears of corn, and rubbed them in their hands and ate them.
042	LUK	006	002	And some of the pharisees said to them, Why do ye do that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath-days?
042	LUK	006	003	And Jesus answering them said, Have ye not read what David did, when he himself was hungry and those that were with him? how he went into the house of God,
042	LUK	006	004	and did take and eat the shew-bread, and gave also to his attendants, which it is not lawful for any to eat but the priests.
042	LUK	006	005	And He said unto them, the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath.
042	LUK	006	006	And it came to pass also on another sabbath, that He went into a synagogue and taught; and there was a man there, whose right hand was withered.
042	LUK	006	007	And the scribes and pharisees watched Him to see if He would work a cure on the sabbath: that they might find an accusation against Him.
042	LUK	006	008	But He knew their thoughts, and said to the man that had the withered hand, Rise, and stand in the midst: and he rose up and stood forth.
042	LUK	006	009	Then said Jesus unto them, I will ask you one thing, Is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or to let it be lost?
042	LUK	006	010	And looking round upon them all, He said to the man, Stretch out thine hand: and he did so, and his hand was made as sound as the other.
042	LUK	006	011	And they were filled with confusion: and consulted together, what they might do to Jesus.
042	LUK	006	012	And in those days He went out to a mountain to pray, and He continued all night in prayer to God.
042	LUK	006	013	And when it was day, He called his disciples to Him: and chose out twelve from among them, whom He also named his apostles:
042	LUK	006	014	(to wit, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew,
042	LUK	006	015	Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alpheus, and Simon called Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James,
042	LUK	006	016	and Judas Iscariot, who was the traitor:)
042	LUK	006	017	and He came down the hill with them, and stood in the plain; with the rest of his disciples, and a great multitude of people from all the parts of Judea, and from Jerusalem, and from the coast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear Him and to be healed of their diseases,
042	LUK	006	018	even those that were tormented by impure spirits: and they were healed.
042	LUK	006	019	And all the people endeavoured to touch Him, for there went a divine virtue out of Him, and healed them all.
042	LUK	006	020	And lifting up his eyes on his disciples He said, Blessed are ye though poor; for the kingdom of God is yours.
042	LUK	006	021	Blessed are ye that hunger now; for ye shall be satisfied. Blessed are ye that weep now; for ye shall laugh.
042	LUK	006	022	Blessed are ye when men shall hate you, and reject you, and reproach you, and cast out your name as infamous on account of the Son of man.
042	LUK	006	023	Rejoice in that day, and be exceeding glad; for behold, your reward is great in heaven: for thus did their fathers to the prophets.
042	LUK	006	024	But wo unto you that are rich; for ye have received your consolation.
042	LUK	006	025	Wo unto you that are full; for ye shall be hungry. Wo unto you that laugh now: for ye shall mourn and weep.
042	LUK	006	026	Wo unto you when all men speak well of you; for their fathers did the same to the false prophets.
042	LUK	006	027	But I say unto you my hearers, Love your enemies, do good to them that hate you,
042	LUK	006	028	bless them that curse you, and pray for them that abuse you;
042	LUK	006	029	to him that smiteth thee on the one cheek, offer also the other; and let him that taketh away thy cloke, have thy coat too rather than strive with him:
042	LUK	006	030	give to him that asketh thee, and from him that taketh thy goods on loan demand nothing.
042	LUK	006	031	And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them in like manner.
042	LUK	006	032	If ye love only them that love you, what thanks are due to you? for even the wicked love those that love them:
042	LUK	006	033	and if ye do good offices to them that do good to you, what thanks are due to you? for even wicked men do the same.
042	LUK	006	034	And if ye lend to those from whom ye expect to receive, what thanks are due to you? for sinners also lend to sinners that they may receive an equivalent.
042	LUK	006	035	But do ye love your enemies, and do good, and lend, expecting nothing from it: and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the sons of the most High; for He is kind even to the ungrateful and the wicked:
042	LUK	006	036	be ye therefore merciful as your heavenly Father also is merciful.
042	LUK	006	037	Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven:
042	LUK	006	038	give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed and shaken down and running over, shall they give into your bosom: for by the same measure, which ye measure with, shall it be measured back again to you.
042	LUK	006	039	And He said to them by way of parable, Can a blind man guide a blind man? will they not both fall into a ditch?
042	LUK	006	040	the learner is not above his teacher, tho' every complete scholar will become as learned as his master.
042	LUK	006	041	But why dost thou look at the chaff in thy brother's eye, and takest no notice of the beam that is in thine own?
042	LUK	006	042	or how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother let me take out the splinter that is in thine eye, when thou thyself seest not the beam that is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite, first take out the beam from thine own eye, and then thou wilt see distinctly how to take out the chaff that is in thy brother's eye.
042	LUK	006	043	For that is not a good tree which produceth bad fruit, nor is the tree bad, which produceth good fruit:
042	LUK	006	044	for every tree is known by it's fruit; for men do not gather figs from thorns, nor grapes from a bramble.
042	LUK	006	045	A good man, out of the good treasure of his heart, bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man, out of the evil treasure of his heart, bringeth forth that which is evil: for out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh.
042	LUK	006	046	But why do ye call me, Lord, Lord, and do not practise what I teach you?
042	LUK	006	047	Whosoever cometh unto me, and heareth my instructions, and observeth them, I will shew you to whom he is like:
042	LUK	006	048	he is like a man who in building an house digged deep, and laid the foundation upon a rock; and when a flood came, the torrent beat violently against that house, but could not shake it, for it was founded upon a rock.
042	LUK	006	049	But he that heareth and observeth not, is like a man that built an house upon the ground without any foundation, which the flood beat violently upon, and immediately it fell down, and the ruin of that house was great.
042	LUK	007	001	Now when He had finished his discourse in the audience of the people, He entered into Capernaum: and a certain centurion's servant,
042	LUK	007	002	whom he had a great value for, was ill and ready to die;
042	LUK	007	003	and having heard of Jesus, he sent unto Him the elders of the Jews, beseeching him that He would come and heal his servant.
042	LUK	007	004	And when they came to Jesus, they intreated Him earnestly, saying, he is worthy of this favor:
042	LUK	007	005	for he loveth our nation, and hath built us a synagogue.
042	LUK	007	006	So Jesus went with them. And when He was now not far from the house, the centurion sent some of his friends to Him, saying Lord, trouble not thyself, for I am not worthy that thou shouldst enter under my roof:
042	LUK	007	007	neither did I think myself worthy to come unto thee. But speak the word, and my servant will be recovered.
042	LUK	007	008	For I also am a man placed under the authority of others, and have soldiers under me; and I say to one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doth it.
042	LUK	007	009	And when Jesus heard these things, He marvelled, and turning about, said to the multitude that followed Him, I declare unto you, I have not found so great faith, no not in Israel.
042	LUK	007	010	And when they that were sent, returned to the house, they found the servant well, that had been sick.
042	LUK	007	011	And the day after He went to a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with Him, and a great multitude besides:
042	LUK	007	012	and as He came near to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carrying out to be buried, his mother's only son, and she was a widow: and many of the people of the city were with her.
042	LUK	007	013	And when the Lord saw her, He was moved with compassion for her, and said to her, Do not weep.
042	LUK	007	014	And He came up and touched the bier, (and the bearers stopped,) and He said, Young man, I say unto thee, arise.
042	LUK	007	015	And the dead person sat up, and began to speak: and He delivered him to his mother.
042	LUK	007	016	And an awe seized them all, and they glorified God, saying, a great prophet is risen up among us, and God hath visited his people.
042	LUK	007	017	And this report of Him was spread through all Judea, and in all the country round about.
042	LUK	007	018	And the disciples of John told him of all these things: so John called two of his disciples to him,
042	LUK	007	019	and sent them to Jesus, saying, Art thou He that was to come, or are we to expect another?
042	LUK	007	020	And the men came to Him, and said, John the baptist hath sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou He that was to come, or are we to expect another?
042	LUK	007	021	(Now at that very time He cured many of their diseases and plagues, and of evil spirits, and gave sight to many that were blind.)
042	LUK	007	022	And Jesus answering said unto them, Go and tell John what ye have seen and heard: that the blind recover sight, the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, the poor have the gospel preached to them,
042	LUK	007	023	and happy is he who shall not be offended at any thing in me.
042	LUK	007	024	When the messengers of John were departed, He began to speak unto the people concerning John, what went ye out into the wilderness to see?
042	LUK	007	025	a reed shaken by the wind? but what did ye go out to see? a man clothed in soft raiment? behold, they that are dressed in fine clothes and live delicately, are in palaces, not in deserts: but what went ye out to see?
042	LUK	007	026	a prophet? yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet.
042	LUK	007	027	This is he of whom it is written, "Behold I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee:"
042	LUK	007	028	for I tell you that among the sons of men there is not a greater prophet than John the baptist: (though the least in the kingdom of God is greater than he:)
042	LUK	007	029	---and all the people that heard him, even the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John;
042	LUK	007	030	but the pharisees indeed and the lawyers rejected the counsel of God within themselves, and were not baptized by him.---
042	LUK	007	031	Whereunto therefore shall I compare the men of this generation?
042	LUK	007	032	and to what are they like? they are like children sitting in the market-place, and calling to one another, and saying, "We have played pleasant tunes to you, and ye have not danced; we have sung mournful ones and ye have not wept:"
042	LUK	007	033	for John the baptist came neither eating bread, nor drinking wine, and ye say, he hath a demon:
042	LUK	007	034	the Son of man is come eating and drinking like other men, and ye call Him a gluttonous man and a wine bibber, and a friend of publicans and sinners.
042	LUK	007	035	But wisdom is justified by all her children.
042	LUK	007	036	And one of the pharisees asked Him to eat with him: and He went into the pharisee's house, and sat down.
042	LUK	007	037	And behold a woman in the city, that was a sinner, when she knew that He was at table in the pharisee's house,
042	LUK	007	038	brought an alabaster-box of ointment, and stood at his feet behind Him, weeping, and washed his feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.
042	LUK	007	039	But when the pharisee that invited Him saw it, he said within himself, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what sort of a woman this is that toucheth Him; for she is a notorious sinner.
042	LUK	007	040	And Jesus said unto him, Simon, I have something to say to thee: (and he replied, Master, say on.)
042	LUK	007	041	A certain creditor had two debtors, the one owed him five hundred denaries, and the other fifty:
042	LUK	007	042	and they not being able to pay him, he freely forgave them both: tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?
042	LUK	007	043	And Simon answered, I suppose he to whom he forgave most. And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged:
042	LUK	007	044	and turning to the woman, He said to Simon, Dost thou see this woman? I came into thine house, and thou gavest me no water for my feet; but she has bathed my feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head.
042	LUK	007	045	Thou gavest me not the respect of a kiss; but this woman, ever since she came in, hath not ceased to kiss my feet.
042	LUK	007	046	Thou didst not anoint my head with common oil, but she hath anointed even my feet with sweet ointment.
042	LUK	007	047	Wherefore, I tell thee, her sins though many are forgiven, for she loved much: but he to whom little is forgiven, loveth but little.
042	LUK	007	048	And He said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven.
042	LUK	007	049	And they that sat at table with Him, said within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also?
042	LUK	007	050	But He said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee, go in peace.
042	LUK	008	001	And it came to pass afterwards that He went through every city and village, preaching and declaring the good tidings of the kingdom of God: and the twelve were with Him;
042	LUK	008	002	and some women that had been cured of evil spirits and other infirmities, as Mary Magdalene, out of whom were cast seven demons,
042	LUK	008	003	and Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others, who assisted Him with their substance.
042	LUK	008	004	And when a great multitude was gathered together, of those that came to Him out of every city, He spake a parable saying,
042	LUK	008	005	A sower went out to sow his seed, and as he was sowing, some fell by the way-side, and was trodden down, and the birds of the air devoured it.
042	LUK	008	006	And some fell upon stony ground, and as soon as it sprung up, it withered away, because it had no moisture.
042	LUK	008	007	And some fell among thorns, and the thorns sprang up with it and choked it.
042	LUK	008	008	But some fell on good ground, and sprang up and yielded fruit an hundred-fold. And as He said these things He cried out, "He that hath ears to hear, let him hear."
042	LUK	008	009	And his disciples asked Him, what might be the meaning of this parable.
042	LUK	008	010	And He said, To you it is granted to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but I speak to others in parables, that in seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.
042	LUK	008	011	Now this is the meaning of the parable, The seed is the word of God:
042	LUK	008	012	and those by the way-side, are such as hear indeed; but then the devil cometh and taketh away the word from their hearts, least they should believe and be saved.
042	LUK	008	013	And those on stony-ground are such as when they hear, receive the word with joy; but have no root, and so believe only for a while, and in the time of trial fall away.
042	LUK	008	014	And that which fell among thorns, are those who when they have heard the word go away and are choked with the cares and riches, and pleasures of life, and bring no fruit to perfection.
042	LUK	008	015	But that on the good ground, are those who having heard the word, retain it in a good and honest heart, and bring forth fruit with patience.
042	LUK	008	016	No man when he hath lighted a candle covereth it with a vessel, or putteth it under a couch; but setteth it on a candlestick, that they who come in may see the light.
042	LUK	008	017	(For there is nothing secret, that shall not be made manifest: nor any thing concealed, which shall not be made known and come to light.)
042	LUK	008	018	Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever improveth what he hath, to him shall more be given; and whosoever hath not, even what he seemeth to have shall be taken from him.
042	LUK	008	019	Now his mother and his brethren came to Him, and could not come at Him for the croud:
042	LUK	008	020	and it was told Him, Thy mother and thy brethren stand without desiring to see thee.
042	LUK	008	021	And He answered and said unto them, My mother and my brethren are these that hear the word of God and do it.
042	LUK	008	022	And it came to pass on one of the days that He went into a ship, Himself and his disciples, and He said to them, Let us go over to the other side of the lake.
042	LUK	008	023	And they launched forth: but as they were failing, He fell asleep: and a storm of wind came down upon the lake, and they were filled with water, and were in great danger.
042	LUK	008	024	And they came to Him and awoke Him, saying, Master, master, we are perishing. Then He arose and rebuked the wind, and the raging of the water, and they ceased, and there was a calm.
042	LUK	008	025	And He said unto them, Where is your faith? But they were struck with awe and amazement, and said one to another, who is this? for He commandeth even the winds and the sea, and they obey Him.
042	LUK	008	026	And they sailed to the country of the Gadarenes, which is over against Galilee.
042	LUK	008	027	And when He was landed, there met Him a man out of the city, who had been possessed by demons a long while, and wore no clothes, and abode in no dwelling but the tombs.
042	LUK	008	028	But when he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell down to Him, and said with a loud voice, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the most high God? I beseech thee, do not torment me.
042	LUK	008	029	(For He commanded the impure spirit to come out of the man; which had oftentimes seized him so violently, that tho' he was bound with chains and fetters, yet he broke the bands asunder, and was driven by the demon into those lonely places.)
042	LUK	008	030	And Jesus asked him, saying, What is thy name? and he said, Legion: because many demons were entred into him.
042	LUK	008	031	And they besought Him that He would not command them to go into the abyss:
042	LUK	008	032	but as there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain, they intreated Him that He would suffer them to enter into them, and He permitted them.
042	LUK	008	033	So the demons went out of the man and entred into the swine: and the herd ran violently down the hill into the lake and were drowned.
042	LUK	008	034	And when those that looked after them saw what was done they fled; and went and told it in city and country:
042	LUK	008	035	and the people went out to see what was done, and came to Jesus; and found the man, from whom the demons were gone out, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind:
042	LUK	008	036	and they were afraid, for those that saw it told them how the demoniac was healed.
042	LUK	008	037	And all the people of the country round about the Gadarenes desired Him to depart from them; for they were seized with great fear: and He went into the ship and returned.
042	LUK	008	038	Now the man from whom the demons were gone out, prayed Him to let him be with Him: but Jesus sent him away,
042	LUK	008	039	saying, Return home, and relate what God hath done for thee. So he went away publishing through the whole city what great things Jesus had done to him.
042	LUK	008	040	And when Jesus returned, a great multitude of people received Him; for they were all waiting for Him.
042	LUK	008	041	And behold there came a man whose name was Jairus, a ruler of the synagogue, and he fell at the feet of Jesus, and intreated Him to come into his house:
042	LUK	008	042	for he had an only daughter, about twelve years old, and she was dying. (But as He was going, the people crouded Him:
042	LUK	008	043	and a woman who had been in a flux twelve years, and had spent her whole livelyhood upon physicians,
042	LUK	008	044	but could not be healed by any, came close behind Him and touched the hem of his garment, and immediately her flux was stopt.
042	LUK	008	045	And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied it, Peter, and those that were with him, said, Sir, the multitudes throng and press thee, and dost thou ask, Who was it that touched me?
042	LUK	008	046	And Jesus said, Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive a peculiar virtue is gone out of me.
042	LUK	008	047	And when the woman saw that she was not concealed, she came trembling, and fell down to Him, and declared before all the people, for what reason she had touched Him, and how she was healed immediately.
042	LUK	008	048	And He said unto her, Daughter, be comforted, thy faith has healed thee, go in peace.)
042	LUK	008	049	While He was yet speaking, there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue's, and said to Him, Thy daughter is dead, trouble not the Master.
042	LUK	008	050	But Jesus hearing it, answered saying, Fear not, only believe, and she shall be recovered.
042	LUK	008	051	And when He came to the house, He suffered none to go in but Peter, and James, and John, and the father and mother of the child.
042	LUK	008	052	And they were all weeping and bewailing her: but He said, Weep not; she is not dead, but sleepeth.
042	LUK	008	053	And they laughed at Him, knowing that she was dead.
042	LUK	008	054	But He turned them all out, and taking hold of her hand, called to her, saying, Child, arise.
042	LUK	008	055	And her spirit returned, and immediately she stood up: and He ordered something to be given her to eat.
042	LUK	008	056	And her parents were exceedingly astonished: but He charged them to tell no one what was done.
042	LUK	009	001	And He called his twelve disciples together, and gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases:
042	LUK	009	002	and He sent them forth to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick.
042	LUK	009	003	And He said unto them, Take nothing for your journey, neither staves, nor bag, nor bread, nor money; nor two coats a piece.
042	LUK	009	004	And into whatever house ye enter, continue there, till ye leave that place.
042	LUK	009	005	And whosoever will not receive you, when ye depart from that city, shake off the very dust from your feet, for a testimony against them.
042	LUK	009	006	And they went from town to town, preaching the gospel and healing every where.
042	LUK	009	007	Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all the things that were done by Him; and was perplexed, because it was said by some that John was risen from the dead;
042	LUK	009	008	and by some that Elias had appeared; and by others, that one of the ancient prophets was risen again.
042	LUK	009	009	And Herod said, John have I beheaded: but who is this, of whom I hear such things? and he wanted to see Him.
042	LUK	009	010	And the apostles; when they were returned, told Him all that they had done: and He took them and retired privately into a desert place belonging to the city Bethsaida.
042	LUK	009	011	But when the people knew it they followed Him; and He received them, and spake to them concerning the kingdom of God, and healed those that had need of a cure.
042	LUK	009	012	And when the day began to decline, the twelve came and said to Him, Dismiss the people, that they may go into the villages and country-places round about, and bait, and get food: for here we are in a desert place.
042	LUK	009	013	But He said unto them, Do ye give them food. And they said, We have but five loaves and two fishes: unless we should go and buy provisions for all this people:
042	LUK	009	014	for they were about five thousand men. And He said to his disciples, Make them sit down in companies by fifty.
042	LUK	009	015	And they did so, and caused them all to sit down.
042	LUK	009	016	And He took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven He blessed them; and brake and gave them to the disciples to set before the multitude.
042	LUK	009	017	And they did eat, and were all satisfied: and there was taken up what remained even of fragments twelve baskets.
042	LUK	009	018	And it came to pass, as He was praying in private, his disciples were with Him: and He asked them saying, Whom say the people that I am?
042	LUK	009	019	They answering said, John the baptist: but others say Elias: and others, that some ancient prophet is risen again.
042	LUK	009	020	And He said unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Peter answered and said, The Christ the Son of God.
042	LUK	009	021	But He strictly charged and commanded them to tell this to no one,
042	LUK	009	022	saying, the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, and chief priests, and scribes, and be put to death, and be raised again the third day.
042	LUK	009	023	And He said unto them all, if any one is willing to come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me:
042	LUK	009	024	for he that would save his life shall lose it, but he that would lose his life for my sake shall save it.
042	LUK	009	025	For what is a man profited, if he gain the whole world, and lose himself, or be destroyed?
042	LUK	009	026	For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when He comes in his own glory, and in his Father's, and of the holy angels.
042	LUK	009	027	And I assure you, there be some of those who stand here, that shall not taste of death, till they have seen the kingdom of God.
042	LUK	009	028	About eight days after these discourses, He took Peter, and John, and James, and went up to a mountain to pray.
042	LUK	009	029	And as He was praying the form of his countenance was altered, and his raiment white and glistering:
042	LUK	009	030	and behold two men talked with Him, which were Moses and Elias;
042	LUK	009	031	who appeared in glory, and spake of his exit, which He was to make at Jerusalem.
042	LUK	009	032	Now Peter and they that were with Him were heavy with sleep; but being awakened they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with Him.
042	LUK	009	033	And as they were departing from Him, Peter said unto Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here, let us make three tabernacles, one for Thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias: not knowing what he said.
042	LUK	009	034	And as he was saying this, there came a cloud and overshadowed them; and they were afraid, when they went up into the cloud and disappeared.
042	LUK	009	035	And there came a voice out of the cloud saying, This is my beloved Son, hear ye Him.
042	LUK	009	036	And when the voice was uttered, Jesus was found alone. And they kept it to themselves, and told no one at that time any of the things which they had seen.
042	LUK	009	037	And the next day, when they came down from the mountain, a great multitude met Him:
042	LUK	009	038	and one of the people cried out, saying, Master, I beseech thee look upon my son, for he is my only child;
042	LUK	009	039	and lo, a spirit seizeth him, and all on a sudden he screameth, and it convulses him with foaming; and bruising him, with much ado departs from him.
042	LUK	009	040	And I prayed thy disciples to cast him out, and they could not.
042	LUK	009	041	Then Jesus answered and said, O unbelieving and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and bear with you? Bring thy son hither.
042	LUK	009	042	And as he was coming along, the devil bruised and convulsed him: but Jesus rebuked the impure spirit, and healed the child, and delivered him to his father.
042	LUK	009	043	And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God: but while they were all wondering at the things which Jesus did, He said to his disciples,
042	LUK	009	044	Receive these words into your ears; for the Son of man is going to be delivered into the hands of men.
042	LUK	009	045	But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them, so that they perceived it not, and they were afraid to ask Him concerning it.
042	LUK	009	046	Then a dispute rose among them, which of them should be greatest.
042	LUK	009	047	And Jesus knowing the thought of their heart, took a child and set him by Him, and said unto them,
042	LUK	009	048	Whosoever shall receive this little child for my sake, receiveth me: and he that receiveth me, receiveth Him that sent me. For he that is lest among you all, shall be great.
042	LUK	009	049	And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out demons in thy name, and we forbad him, because he followeth not thee with us.
042	LUK	009	050	And Jesus said unto him, Forbid him not; for he, that is not against us, is for us.
042	LUK	009	051	And it came to pass, as the days were almost fulfilled of his being received up again into heaven, that He set his face to go to Jerusalem,
042	LUK	009	052	and sent messengers before Him: who went into a village of the Samaritans to get a place ready for Him.
042	LUK	009	053	But they would not entertain Him, because his face was towards Jerusalem.
042	LUK	009	054	And when his disciples James and John saw it, they said, Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven and consume them, as Elias did?
042	LUK	009	055	But He turned and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what spirit ye are of:
042	LUK	009	056	for the Son of man came not to destroy mens lives, but to save them. And they went to another village.
042	LUK	009	057	And as they were going by the way, there was one said to Him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest:
042	LUK	009	058	and Jesus answered him, The foxes have holes, and the fowls of heaven their nests, but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.
042	LUK	009	059	And He said to another, Follow me: but he said, Lord, permit me to go first and bury my father:
042	LUK	009	060	but Jesus said unto him, Leave the dead to bury their dead; but go thou and preach the kingdom of God.
042	LUK	009	061	And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee, but allow me first to go and take my leave of my family.
042	LUK	009	062	But Jesus said unto him, No one, that hath put his hand to the plough and looketh back, is fit for the kingdom of God.
042	LUK	010	001	After these things the Lord appointed also seventy others, and sent them two and two before Him, into every city and place, whither He himself was about to come.
042	LUK	010	002	And He said unto them, The harvest indeed is great, but the laborers are few: pray therefore to the Lord of the harvest, that He would send out workmen to his harvest.
042	LUK	010	003	Go your ways: behold I send you forth as lambs in the midst of wolves.
042	LUK	010	004	Carry neither purse, nor bag, nor shoes; and salute no one by the way.
042	LUK	010	005	But whatever house ye come into, first say, Peace be to this house:
042	LUK	010	006	and if there be a child of peace there, your peace shall rest upon it: if not, it shall return upon yourselves.
042	LUK	010	007	But remain in the same house, eating and drinking such as they have; for the laborer is worthy of his hire.
042	LUK	010	008	Go not from house to house. And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set before you;
042	LUK	010	009	and heal those in it that are sick, and say unto them, The kingdom of God is come unto you.
042	LUK	010	010	But into whatever city ye come, and they receive you not, go out into the streets of it and say,
042	LUK	010	011	even the dust that cleaveth to us out of your city we wipe off against you: but know this, that the kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.
042	LUK	010	012	And I tell you, it shall be more tolerable in that day even for Sodom than for that city.
042	LUK	010	013	Wo unto thee, Chorazin, wo unto thee, Bethsaida, for if the miracles wrought among you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would long ago have repented, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.
042	LUK	010	014	But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgement than for you.
042	LUK	010	015	And thou Capernaum, which art exalted even to heaven, shalt be cast down to hell.
042	LUK	010	016	---He, that heareth you, heareth me; and he, that rejecteth you, rejecteth me; and he, that rejecteth me, rejecteth Him that sent me.
042	LUK	010	017	And the seventy returned with joy saying, Lord, even the devils are subject to us through thy name.
042	LUK	010	018	And He said unto them, I beheld Satan, as lightning, falling from heaven.
042	LUK	010	019	Behold I give you power to trample upon serpents and scorpions, and over all the might of the enemy; and nothing shall at all hurt you.
042	LUK	010	020	However rejoice not in this, that the spirits are subject to you; but rather rejoice that your names are written in heaven.
042	LUK	010	021	At this time Jesus was transported with joy in his spirit and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and knowing, and hast revealed them to babes: even so, Father, for such was thy good pleasure.
042	LUK	010	022	All things are delivered to me by my Father: and none knoweth who the Son is, but the Father: and who the Father is, but the Son; and he to whom the Son pleaseth to reveal Him.
042	LUK	010	023	And turning to the disciples, He said to them in particular, Blessed are the eyes that see what ye see:
042	LUK	010	024	for many prophets and kings desired to see the things which ye see, and did not see them; and to hear what ye hear, but did not hear them.
042	LUK	010	025	And behold, a lawyer stood up to try Him, and said, Master, what must I do to inherit eternal life?
042	LUK	010	026	He said to him, What is written in the law? How readest thou there?
042	LUK	010	027	And he answered, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind: and thy neighbor as thyself.
042	LUK	010	028	And He said unto him, Thou hast answered right; do this and thou shalt live.
042	LUK	010	029	But he willing to justify himself said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbor?
042	LUK	010	030	And Jesus replying said, There was a certain man going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he fell among thieves, who after they had stripped and beaten him, went away, leaving him half dead.
042	LUK	010	031	And by chance a certain priest came down that way, and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.
042	LUK	010	032	Likewise a Levite also, when he came to the place, went and looked at him, and then crossed the way and passed by.
042	LUK	010	033	But a certain Samaritan, as he was travelling, came up to him, and when He saw him,
042	LUK	010	034	he was moved with compassion, and went to him and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine; and setting him upon his own beast, brought him to an inn and took care of him.
042	LUK	010	035	And on the morrow, when he went away he took out two denaries, and gave them to the inn-keeper, and said to him, Take care of him, and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again I will repay thee.
042	LUK	010	036	Which now of these three dost thou think was neighbor to him that fell among the thieves?
042	LUK	010	037	And he said, He that took pity on him. Therefore said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou in like manner.
042	LUK	010	038	And as they were journeying, He entered into a certain village; and a woman named Martha received Him into her house.
042	LUK	010	039	And she had a sister called Mary, who sat at the feet of Jesus, attending to his discourse.
042	LUK	010	040	But Martha, being perplexed about much serving, came to Him and said, Lord, dost thou not regard it, that my sister has left me to serve alone? speak to her therefore that she may help me.
042	LUK	010	041	And Jesus said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art anxious and in a hurry about many things: but one thing is necessary.
042	LUK	010	042	And Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her.
042	LUK	011	001	And as He was praying in a certain retired place, as soon as He had done, one of his disciples said to Him, Lord, teach us to pray as John also taught his disciples.
042	LUK	011	002	And He said unto them, when ye pray, say, "Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name; thy kingdom come; thy will be done as in heaven so also upon earth;
042	LUK	011	003	give us day by day our daily bread; and forgive us our sins,
042	LUK	011	004	for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one."
042	LUK	011	005	And He said unto them, Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go to him at midnight, and say to him, Friend, lend me three loaves; for a friend of mine on his journey is come to me,
042	LUK	011	006	and I have nothing to set before him:
042	LUK	011	007	and he from within shall answer and say, Do not be troublesome; the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed, I cannot rise to give thee.
042	LUK	011	008	I tell you, tho' he will not rise and give him, because he is his friend: yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he wants.
042	LUK	011	009	And so I tell you, Ask and it shall be given you, seek and ye shall find, knock and it shall be opened unto you.
042	LUK	011	010	For every one that asketh receiveth, and he that seeketh findeth, and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.
042	LUK	011	011	If a son ask bread of any father among you, will he give him a stone? and if he ask for a fish, will he instead of a fish give him a serpent? or if he ask for an egg,
042	LUK	011	012	will he give him a scorpion?
042	LUK	011	013	If ye then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more shall your heavenly Father give the holy Spirit to them that ask Him?
042	LUK	011	014	And He was casting out a demon, and it was dumb: and when the demon was gone out, the dumb man spake; and the people wondered.
042	LUK	011	015	But some of them said, He casteth out demons by Beelzebub the prince of demons:
042	LUK	011	016	and others, to try Him, desired of Him a sign from heaven.
042	LUK	011	017	But He who well knew their thoughts, said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself becomes desolate, and a house against a house falleth: if Satan also be divided against himself,
042	LUK	011	018	how shall his kingdom stand? because ye say, that I cast out demons by Beelzebub.
042	LUK	011	019	And if I by Beelzebub cast out demons, by whom do your own people cast them out? wherefore they shall be your judges.
042	LUK	011	020	But if I cast out demons by the power of God, you may be sure the kingdom of God is come unto you:
042	LUK	011	021	for when a strong man well-armed defends his palace, his substance is secure:
042	LUK	011	022	but when a stronger than he cometh upon him and conquers him, he taketh away his armour, wherein he trusted, and divideth his spoils.
042	LUK	011	023	He, that is not with me, is against me; and he, that gathereth not with me, scattereth.
042	LUK	011	024	When an impure spirit is gone out of a man, he wanders through dry desert places, seeking rest: and finding none he saith, I will return into my house, that I came out of;
042	LUK	011	025	and when he cometh he findeth it swept and set in order.
042	LUK	011	026	Then he goeth and taketh with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and so the last state of that man is worse than the first.
042	LUK	011	027	As He was speaking these things, a certain woman lifted up her voice from amidst the croud, and said, Happy is the womb that bare thee, and the breasts which thou didst suck!
042	LUK	011	028	but He replied, Yea rather happy are they, that hear the word of God and keep it.
042	LUK	011	029	And when the multitudes were gathering thick together He began to say, This is a wicked generation: they demand a sign, but no sign shall be given them, except that of the prophet Jonah:
042	LUK	011	030	for as Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites, so shall also the Son of man be to this generation.
042	LUK	011	031	The queen of the south shall rise up in the day of judgement against the men of this generation and condemn them: for she came from the remote parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold a greater than Solomon is here.
042	LUK	011	032	And the men of Nineveh shall rise up in the judgement against this generation, and condemn it; for they repented upon the preaching of Jonas, and behold a greater than Jonas is here.
042	LUK	011	033	But yet no one having lighted a candle putteth it into a secret place, nor under a bushel, but on a candlestick, that they who come in may see the light.
042	LUK	011	034	The eye is the candle of the body: therefore when thine eye is clear, thy whole body also is light; but when it is bad, thy body also is dark.
042	LUK	011	035	Take heed therefore least the light which is in thee be darkness.
042	LUK	011	036	For if thy whole body be light, having no part dark, it will be (when all enlightened) as when a candle giveth thee light by its brightness.
042	LUK	011	037	And as He spake, a certain pharisee asked Him to dine with him: and He went in and sat down at table.
042	LUK	011	038	And when the pharisee saw it he wondered that He did not wash first, before dinner.
042	LUK	011	039	But the Lord said unto him, ye pharisees clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but your inward part is full of rapine and wickedness.
042	LUK	011	040	Senseless creatures! Did not He who made the outside, make also that which is within? give alms rather according to your ability:
042	LUK	011	041	and behold all things are clean to you.
042	LUK	011	042	But wo unto you pharisees, who tithe even your mint, and rue, and all your herbs, and pass by judgement and the love of God: these ought ye to practise and not to omit the others.
042	LUK	011	043	Wo unto you pharisees; for ye love the chief seat in synagogues, and salutations in public places.
042	LUK	011	044	Wo unto you scribes and pharisees, hypocrites; for ye are like graves that do not appear, and those that walk over them are not aware of them.
042	LUK	011	045	And one of the doctors of the law answered and said unto Him, Master, in saying these things thou reproachest us also.
042	LUK	011	046	And He said, Wo unto you also, ye interpreters of the law, for ye load men with insupportable burthens, and ye yourselves touch not the burthens with one of your fingers.
042	LUK	011	047	Wo unto you; who build the sepulchres of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.
042	LUK	011	048	Thus ye testify that ye approve of the deeds of your fathers; for they put them to death, and ye build their sepulchres.
042	LUK	011	049	And therefore the wisdom of God hath said, I will send them prophets and apostles, and some of them they will kill and persecute:
042	LUK	011	050	that the blood of all the prophets which has been shed from the foundation of the world may be required of this generation, from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zachariah,
042	LUK	011	051	who perished between the altar and the temple. Verily I tell you, it shall be required of this generation.
042	LUK	011	052	Wo unto you interpreters of the law; for ye have taken away the key of knowledge, ye entered not in yourselves, and those that were entering in, ye hindered.
042	LUK	011	053	As He was saying these things unto them the scribes and pharisees began vehemently to attack Him, and urge Him to speak of many things,
042	LUK	011	054	laying snares for Him, and endeavouring to catch something out of his mouth, that they might accuse Him.
042	LUK	012	001	In the mean time great multitudes of people being gathered together about Him, so that they trode upon one another, He began to say to his disciples, Beware of the leaven of the pharisees, which is hypocrisy: for there is nothing concealed,
042	LUK	012	002	which shall not be discovered; nor hidden which shall not be known.
042	LUK	012	003	Therefore whatsoever ye have said in darkness shall be heard in the light: and what ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed on the house-tops.
042	LUK	012	004	Now I say unto you, my friends, Be not afraid of them, that can only kill the body, and after that have nothing more that they can do.
042	LUK	012	005	But I will shew you whom ye should fear, ---Fear Him, who after He hath killed, hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, fear Him.
042	LUK	012	006	Are not five sparrows sold for two assaries, and not one of them is forgotten before God.
042	LUK	012	007	Nay the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Be not therefore afraid; ye are of more worth than many sparrows.
042	LUK	012	008	But I say unto you, Whosoever shall own me before men, the Son of man will also own him before the angels of God.
042	LUK	012	009	But he, that disowneth me before men, shall be disowned before the angels of God.
042	LUK	012	010	And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it may be forgiven him; but unto him, that blasphemeth the holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven.
042	LUK	012	011	And when they bring you before the synagogues, and magistrates, and powers, be not solicitous how or what defence to make, or what to say:
042	LUK	012	012	for the holy Spirit shall teach you at that very time what ye ought to say.
042	LUK	012	013	And one among the multitude said to Him, Master, speak to my brother to divide the inheritance with me: but He said unto him,
042	LUK	012	014	Man, who set me over you as a judge or divider?
042	LUK	012	015	And He said unto them, See to it that ye beware of covetousness; for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of his possessions.
042	LUK	012	016	And He spake a parable to them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully:
042	LUK	012	017	and he reasoned within himself, saying, What shall I do? for I have not room to lay up my corn.
042	LUK	012	018	And he said, This I will do: I will pull down my barns, and build larger ones; and there I will bestow all my products and my goods.
042	LUK	012	019	And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast plenty of goods laid up for many years, take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry.
042	LUK	012	020	But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night shall thy soul be required of thee; then whose shall those things be which thou hast provided?
042	LUK	012	021	So is he that heapeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich towards God.
042	LUK	012	022	And He said to his disciples, Therefore I say unto you, be not anxious for your life, what ye shall eat; nor for the body, what ye shall put on:
042	LUK	012	023	the life is more than food, and the body than raiment.
042	LUK	012	024	Consider the ravens: they neither sow nor reap; they have neither store-house nor barn, and yet God feedeth them: how much more worth are ye than the fowls?
042	LUK	012	025	And which of you by all his thought can add one moment to his life?
042	LUK	012	026	If then ye cannot do even the lest, why are ye so anxious about the rest?
042	LUK	012	027	Consider the lilies, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin: and yet I tell you, that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.
042	LUK	012	028	Now if God so clothe the grass which is to day in the field, and to-morrow is cast into the furnace, how much more will He clothe you, O ye of little faith?
042	LUK	012	029	And seek ye not what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; neither be ye in careful suspense:
042	LUK	012	030	for all these things the nations of the world seek after; but your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things.
042	LUK	012	031	Seek ye therefore the kingdom of God, and all these shall be super-added unto you.
042	LUK	012	032	Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's pleasure to give you the kingdom.
042	LUK	012	033	Sell what ye have, and give alms: provide yourselves bags which wax not old, a never-failing treasure in the heavens, where no thief approacheth nor moth corrupteth:
042	LUK	012	034	for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
042	LUK	012	035	Let your loins be girt, and your lights burning, and
042	LUK	012	036	ye yourselves like men waiting for their lord's return from a wedding, that they may immediately open the door to him, when he comes and knocks.
042	LUK	012	037	Happy are those servants, whom the master when he cometh shall find watching: verily I say unto you, that he will gird himself, and make them sit down, and will come and serve them.
042	LUK	012	038	And if he come in the second watch, or in the third watch, and find them so, happy indeed are those servants.
042	LUK	012	039	And this ye know, that if the master of a house had known at what hour the thief would come, he would have watched, and not have suffered his house to be broke open:
042	LUK	012	040	therefore be ye also ready; for the Son of man cometh at a season that ye think not of.
042	LUK	012	041	Then said Peter unto Him, Lord, dost thou speak this parable to us only, or to all others likewise?
042	LUK	012	042	And the Lord said, Who is indeed that faithful and wise steward, whom his master will set over his family to give out the measure of food in due season?
042	LUK	012	043	Happy is that servant, whom his lord, when he cometh, shall find so doing.
042	LUK	012	044	Verily I tell you, that he will set him over all that he hath.
042	LUK	012	045	But if that servant say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming; and begin to beat the men and maid-servants, and drink, and to be drunken:
042	LUK	012	046	the lord of that servant will come on a day in which he does not expect him, and at a time which he is not aware of; and will cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the unfaithful.
042	LUK	012	047	And that servant, who knew his master's will, and did not prepare himself to do according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes;
042	LUK	012	048	but he that knew it not, and did things deserving stripes, shall be beaten with few: for to whomsoever much is given, of him will much be required; and to whom men have committed much, of him they will demand the more.
042	LUK	012	049	I am come to send fire on the earth, and how do I desire that it were already kindled?
042	LUK	012	050	for I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how I am straitened till it be accomplished?
042	LUK	012	051	Do ye think that I am come to give peace on the earth? I tell you, nay; but rather division.
042	LUK	012	052	For from this time there shall be five in one family divided, three against two and two against three:
042	LUK	012	053	the father will be against the son, and the son against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother; the mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law, and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.
042	LUK	012	054	He said also to the people, When ye see a cloud rising from the west, ye presently say, there is a shower coming, and so it proves:
042	LUK	012	055	and when ye observe the south-wind blowing, ye say there will be heat, and it cometh to pass.
042	LUK	012	056	Ye hypocrites, ye know how to discern the face of the earth and of the heavens, and why do ye not discern the present time?
042	LUK	012	057	and why do ye not even of yourselves judge what is right?
042	LUK	012	058	When thou art going with thine adversary to the magistrate, endeavour while thou art in the way to be discharged, least he force thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and the officer carry thee to prison.
042	LUK	012	059	I tell thee, thou shalt not come out from thence, till thou hast paid the very last mite.
042	LUK	013	001	There were present at the same time, some that told Him of the Galileans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices.
042	LUK	013	002	And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye think that these were sinners above all the Galileans, because they suffered such things?
042	LUK	013	003	I tell you, No: but, unless ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.
042	LUK	013	004	Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and killed them, do ye think that they were sinners above all the inhabitants in Jerusalem?
042	LUK	013	005	I tell you, No: but, unless ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.
042	LUK	013	006	And He spake this parable, A certain man had a fig-tree planted in his vineyard, and he came seeking fruit on it, but found none.
042	LUK	013	007	And he said to the vine-dresser, behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig-tree, and find none: cut it down, why should it cumber the ground?
042	LUK	013	008	And he said to him, Sir, let it alone this year also, till I dig about it, and lay dung to it:
042	LUK	013	009	then perhaps it may bear fruit; if not, afterwards cut it down.
042	LUK	013	010	And when He was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath-day,
042	LUK	013	011	there was a woman that had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and was bowed together, and utterly unable to lift herself upright.
042	LUK	013	012	And when Jesus saw her, He called her to Him, and said to her, Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity.
042	LUK	013	013	And He laid his hands upon her; and immediately she was made straight, and glorified God.
042	LUK	013	014	But the ruler of the synagogue, being provoked that Jesus had wrought a cure on the sabbath-day, said to the people, There are six days in which ye ought to work; on these therefore come and be healed, and not on the sabbath-day.
042	LUK	013	015	The Lord therefore answered him and said, Thou hypocrite, does not any of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall and lead him away to watering?
042	LUK	013	016	And might not this woman, a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan hath bound these eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the sabbath-day?
042	LUK	013	017	Upon his saying this, all his adversaries were ashamed: but the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by Him.
042	LUK	013	018	Then said He, To what is the kingdom of God like, and to what shall I compare it?
042	LUK	013	019	It is like a grain of mustard-seed, which a man took and sowed in his garden, and it grew, and became a great tree, and the birds of the air lodged in it's boughs.
042	LUK	013	020	And again He said, To what shall I compare the kingdom of God?
042	LUK	013	021	It is like leaven, which a woman took and put into three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.
042	LUK	013	022	And he went through the cities and villages teaching, as He journeyed towards Jerusalem.
042	LUK	013	023	And one said to Him, Lord, are there but few that shall be saved?
042	LUK	013	024	But He said unto them, Strive to enter in at the strait gate; for I tell you, many will desire to enter in, and shall not be able.
042	LUK	013	025	When the master of the house shall have risen up and shut the door, and ye begin to stand without and knock at the door saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; and He shall answer and say to you, I know you not, whence ye are:
042	LUK	013	026	then shall ye begin to say, We have eaten and drank in thy presence,
042	LUK	013	027	and thou hast taught in our streets, But He will say, I tell you, I know you not, whence ye are; depart from me all ye workers of iniquity:
042	LUK	013	028	and there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, and you yourselves shut out.
042	LUK	013	029	Yea they shall come from the east, and from the west, and from the north, and from the south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of God.
042	LUK	013	030	And behold, there are some last who shall be first, and there are first that shall be last.
042	LUK	013	031	At the same time came some of the pharisees, and said to Him, Go out and depart hence, for Herod intends to kill thee.
042	LUK	013	032	And He said to them, Go, tell that fox, Behold, I cast out demons and perform cures today and to-morrow; and in a little while I am to be perfected:
042	LUK	013	033	but I must procede to-day and to-morrow and the following; for it cannot be supposed that a prophet should be cut off but in Jerusalem.
042	LUK	013	034	O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that killest the prophets and stonest them that are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children, as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and ye would not?
042	LUK	013	035	Behold, your house is left unto you desolate: and I assure you ye shall not see me again till the time come when ye shall say, Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord.
042	LUK	014	001	And as He went into the house of one of the chief of the pharisees to eat on the sabbath-day, and they were watching Him,
042	LUK	014	002	behold, there was a certain man before Him that had a dropsy.
042	LUK	014	003	And Jesus spake to the expounders of the law and to the pharisees, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath-day?
042	LUK	014	004	but they made no answer. And He took him and healed him, and sent him away:
042	LUK	014	005	and said unto them, Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fall into a pit, and will not immediately draw him out even on the sabbath-day?
042	LUK	014	006	and they were not able to answer Him again to these things.
042	LUK	014	007	And He spake a parable to those that were invited, observing how they chose the chief seats, saying unto them,
042	LUK	014	008	When thou art invited by any one to a wedding, do not sit down in the uppermost place, least one more honorable than thou be invited by him;
042	LUK	014	009	and he who invited thee and him, should come and say to thee, Give place to this person, and then thou begin with shame to take the lowest place.
042	LUK	014	010	But when thou art invited, go and sit down at the lowest place, that, when he who invited thee cometh, he may say to thee, Friend, go up higher: then wilt thou have honor before them that sit at table with thee:
042	LUK	014	011	for whosoever exalteth himself shall be humbled, and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.
042	LUK	014	012	He said also to him that had invited Him, When thou makest a dinner or a supper, do not invite thy friends, nor thy brethren, nor thy kindred, nor thy rich neighbors; least they invite thee again, and so a return be made thee.
042	LUK	014	013	But when thou makest a feast, invite the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind; and thou shalt be happy;
042	LUK	014	014	because they have not wherewith to requite thee: for a recompense shall be given thee at the resurrection of the just.
042	LUK	014	015	And one of those; who sat at table with Him, hearing these things, said unto Him, Happy is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God.
042	LUK	014	016	Upon which He said, A certain man made a great supper and invited many;
042	LUK	014	017	and sent his servant at supper-time to say to them that were invited, Come, for all things are now ready.
042	LUK	014	018	And they all with one consent began to make excuses; the first said, I have bought a field, and I must go and see it, pray have me excused.
042	LUK	014	019	And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and am going to try them, pray have me excused.
042	LUK	014	020	And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.
042	LUK	014	021	So the servant came and told his lord these things. Then the master of the house being angry said to his servant, Go directly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor, and the maimed, and the lame, and the blind.
042	LUK	014	022	And the servant said, Sir, it is done according to thine order, and still there is room.
042	LUK	014	023	And the lord said to the servant, Go out into the high-ways and hedges, and press them to come in, that my house may be filled:
042	LUK	014	024	for I tell you, that none of those men who were invited, shall taste of my supper.
042	LUK	014	025	Now there were great multitudes going along with Him:
042	LUK	014	026	so he turned and said to them, If any man come to me, and does not comparatively hate his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea and his own life too, he cannot be my disciple.
042	LUK	014	027	And whosoever doth not bear his cross, and follow me, cannot be my disciple.
042	LUK	014	028	For who of you that hath a mind to build a tower does not first sit down and calculate the expence, whether he hath wherewithal to perfect it?
042	LUK	014	029	least having laid a foundation and not being able to finish,
042	LUK	014	030	all that see it, should deride him, saying, this man began to build and was not able to finish.
042	LUK	014	031	Or what king, going to engage with another king in battle, doth not sit down first and consult, whether he be able with ten thousand men to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand?
042	LUK	014	032	and if not, while he is yet far off, he sendeth an embassy, and desireth conditions of peace.
042	LUK	014	033	So, every one of you, that doth not give up all that he hath, cannot be my disciple.
042	LUK	014	034	Salt is good; but if the salt have lost it's savor, wherewith shall it be seasoned?
042	LUK	014	035	it is neither fit for the land, nor for the dunghil; but they throw it away. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
042	LUK	015	001	Then drew near unto Him all the publicans and other notorious sinners, to hear Him.
042	LUK	015	002	And the pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This man entertaineth wicked persons, and eateth with them.
042	LUK	015	003	But He spake to them this parable,
042	LUK	015	004	saying, What man of you that hath an hundred sheep, and loseth one of them, doth not leave the ninety-nine in the field, and go after that which was lost, till he find it?
042	LUK	015	005	And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders rejoicing:
042	LUK	015	006	and coming home, he calleth his friends and neighbors together and saith unto them, Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost.
042	LUK	015	007	Thus, I tell you, there shall be joy in heaven over one repenting sinner, more than over ninety-nine righteous persons, that have no need of repentance.
042	LUK	015	008	Or what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she lose one, doth not light a candle, and sweep the house, and search carefully till she find it?
042	LUK	015	009	and when she hath found it, she calleth her friends and neighbors together; saying, Rejoice with me, for I have found the piece which I had lost.
042	LUK	015	010	Thus, I tell you, there is joy among the angels of God over one repenting sinner.
042	LUK	015	011	And He said, a certain man had two sons: and the younger of them said to his father,
042	LUK	015	012	Father, give me the portion that falleth to my share. And he divided his substance between them.
042	LUK	015	013	And not many days after the younger son gathered all together and went abroad into a distant country, and there squandered away his substance by living luxuriously.
042	LUK	015	014	And when he had spent all, there happen'd a grievous famine in that country, and he began to be in want.
042	LUK	015	015	And he went and let himself to one of the people of that country, who sent him into his fields to feed swine.
042	LUK	015	016	And he would gladly have filled his belly with the husks which the swine did eat: and no man relieved him.
042	LUK	015	017	But coming to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father have bread enough and to spare, and I am perishing with hunger?
042	LUK	015	018	I will rise and go to my father, and will say to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and before thee,
042	LUK	015	019	and am no longer worthy to be called thy son; make me as one of thy hired servants.
042	LUK	015	020	And he rose and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and was moved with compassion; and he ran and fell on his neck and kissed him.
042	LUK	015	021	And his son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and before thee, and am no longer worthy to be called thy son.
042	LUK	015	022	But the father said to his servants, bring out the best robe, and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet:
042	LUK	015	023	and bring hither the fatted calf and kill it, and let us eat and be merry:
042	LUK	015	024	for this my son was dead, and is alive again, and was lost and is found. And they began to be merry.
042	LUK	015	025	But his elder son was out in the field: and as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard music and dancing:
042	LUK	015	026	and he called one of the servants to him, and asked what these things meant.
042	LUK	015	027	And he said to him, Thy brother is come, and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and well: but he was angry, and would not go in.
042	LUK	015	028	Therefore his father came out and desired him.
042	LUK	015	029	But he answered and said to his father, Behold so many years as I serve thee, nor have I ever transgressed thy command, and yet thou hast never given me a kid, to be merry with my friends:
042	LUK	015	030	but as soon as this thy son was come, who hath eaten up thy substance with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.
042	LUK	015	031	And he said unto him, Son, thou art always with me, and all that I have is thine.
042	LUK	015	032	But it was fit we should be merry and rejoice; for this thy brother was dead, and is come to life again, was lost and is found.
042	LUK	016	001	And He said also to his disciples, There was a certain rich man, who had a steward; and he was accused to him of wasting his goods.
042	LUK	016	002	And he called him, and said unto him, What is this I hear of thee? give up the accounts of thy stewardship, for thou canst be no longer steward.
042	LUK	016	003	And the steward said in himself, What shall I do? now my master takes away the stewardship from me; I am not able to work, and I am ashamed to beg.
042	LUK	016	004	I know what I will do, that when I am turned out of my place, they may receive me into their houses.
042	LUK	016	005	So he called his master's debtors to him, and said to the first, How much owest thou to my master? and he said, an hundred baths of oil.
042	LUK	016	006	And he said to him, Take thy bill, and sit down and write but fifty.
042	LUK	016	007	Then he said to another, And how much owest thou? and he said, an hundred measures of wheat: and he said to him, Take thy bill, and write fourscore.
042	LUK	016	008	And his master commended the dishonest steward as having acted prudently: for the men of this world are as to their affairs wiser than the children of light.
042	LUK	016	009	And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends with these unrighteous treasures, that when they fail, ye may be received into everlasting habitations.
042	LUK	016	010	He, that is faithful in the lest, is faithful also in much: and he, that is unjust in the lest, is unjust also in much.
042	LUK	016	011	If therefore ye have not been faithful in the false riches, who will intrust you with the true?
042	LUK	016	012	and if ye have not been faithful in that which was another's, who will give you that which is your own?
042	LUK	016	013	No servant can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or at lest he will be attached to the one, and neglect the other. Ye cannot serve God and Mammon.
042	LUK	016	014	And the pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things; and derided Him.
042	LUK	016	015	And He said unto them, Ye justify yourselves before men, but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.
042	LUK	016	016	The law and the prophets continued until John: from that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every one presseth into it.
042	LUK	016	017	Though it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away, than one tittle of the law to fail.
042	LUK	016	018	Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery; and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband committeth adultery.
042	LUK	016	019	Now there was a certain rich man, who was clothed in purple and fine linen, living voluptuously and splendidly every day.
042	LUK	016	020	And there was a poor man named Lazarus,
042	LUK	016	021	who was laid at his gate full of sores, and desiring to be fed with the crumbs that fell from the rich man's table: and the dogs came and licked his sores. And it came to pass that the poor man died,
042	LUK	016	022	and was carried by angels to Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried.
042	LUK	016	023	And in hell he lifted up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham from afar, and Lazarus in his bosom.
042	LUK	016	024	And he cried out and said, Father Abraham, have pity on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.
042	LUK	016	025	And Abraham said, Son, remember that thou receivedst thy good things in thy life-time, and likewise Lazarus his evils: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.
042	LUK	016	026	And besides, there is a great gulf fixed between us and you; so that they, who would pass from hence to you, cannot; nor can they pass to us, who would come from thence.
042	LUK	016	027	Then he said, Therefore I intreat thee, Father, that thou wouldst send him to my father's house:
042	LUK	016	028	for I have five brethren; that he may testify to them my misery, least they also come into this place of torment.
042	LUK	016	029	Abraham answered him, They have Moses and the prophets, let them hear them:
042	LUK	016	030	and he said, Nay, father Abraham, but if one went to them from the dead, they will repent.
042	LUK	016	031	And he replied, If they hearken not to Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded though one should rise from the dead.
042	LUK	017	001	Then said He to the disciples, It is impossible that offences should not come: but wo to him by whom they come.
042	LUK	017	002	It were better for him that a milstone were hung about his neck, and he were thrown into the sea, than that he should cause one of these little ones to offend.
042	LUK	017	003	Take heed to yourselves: if thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him.
042	LUK	017	004	And if he trespass against thee seven times a day, and seven times in a day return to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him.
042	LUK	017	005	And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith.
042	LUK	017	006	And the Lord said, If ye had faith but as a grain of mustard-seed, ye might say to this sycamine-tree, Be thou rooted up and planted in the sea; and it would obey you.
042	LUK	017	007	But which of you having a servant plowing, or feeding cattle, will say to him, as soon as he comes in from the field, Come hither and sit down at table?
042	LUK	017	008	But will he not rather say to him, Get ready my supper, and gird thyself, and wait upon me, till I have done, and afterwards thou shalt eat and drink.
042	LUK	017	009	Is he obliged to that servant for doing what he was ordered?
042	LUK	017	010	I think not. So likewise ye, when ye have done all things that were commanded you, say we are unprofitable servants, for we have done only what we ought to do.
042	LUK	017	011	And as He was going to Jerusalem, He passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee;
042	LUK	017	012	and as He entered into a certain village, there met Him ten men that were lepers:
042	LUK	017	013	who stood at a distance, and lifted up their voice, saying, Jesus master, have pity on us.
042	LUK	017	014	And when He saw them, He said unto them, Go and shew yourselves to the priests. And it came to pass as they were going, they were cleansed.
042	LUK	017	015	And one of them, perceiving that he was healed, returned, with a loud voice glorifying God:
042	LUK	017	016	and fell prostrate at his feet, giving Him thanks; and He was a Samaritan.
042	LUK	017	017	And Jesus answered and said, Were not all the ten cleansed? and where are the other nine?
042	LUK	017	018	Are there none returning to give glory to God, but this stranger?
042	LUK	017	019	And He said to him, Arise, go thy way; thy faith hath saved thee.
042	LUK	017	020	And being asked by the pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, He answered and said, the kingdom of God cometh not with observation.
042	LUK	017	021	Neither shall they say, Behold it is here, or behold it is there; for the kingdom of God is within you.
042	LUK	017	022	And He said to the disciples, the time will come, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and shall not see it.
042	LUK	017	023	And they will say to you, Behold, He is here, or behold He is there: but go not after them, nor follow them.
042	LUK	017	024	For as the lightning which lightneth from the one part of heaven shineth to the other: so also shall the Son of man be in his day.
042	LUK	017	025	But He must suffer many things first, and be rejected by this generation.
042	LUK	017	026	And as it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.
042	LUK	017	027	They were eating, drinking, marrying, and being married, till the day that Noah went into the ark: and the flood came and destroyed them all.
042	LUK	017	028	And as it was likewise in the days of Lot; they were eating, drinking, buying, selling, planting, and building:
042	LUK	017	029	but the very day that Lot went out from Sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all.
042	LUK	017	030	Thus shall it be in the day that the Son of man is revealed.
042	LUK	017	031	In that day, whoever shall be on the house-top, and his goods in the house, let him not come down into it to take them away: and he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back.
042	LUK	017	032	Remember Lot's wife. Whosoever shall seek to save his life, shall lose it;
042	LUK	017	033	and whosoever will venture his life, shall preserve it.
042	LUK	017	034	In that night there shall be two in one bed; the one shall be taken and the other left:
042	LUK	017	035	two women shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken and the other left:
042	LUK	017	036	two men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken and the other left.
042	LUK	017	037	And they answered and said unto Him, Where, Lord? And He said to them, where the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered together.
042	LUK	018	001	And He spake also a parable to them, to shew that men ought always to pray, and not to faint:
042	LUK	018	002	saying, There was a judge in a certain city, who neither feared God, nor regarded man.
042	LUK	018	003	And there was a widow in that city, who came to him, saying, Do me justice of my adversary.
042	LUK	018	004	And he would not for a time: but afterwards he said within himself, Though I fear not God,
042	LUK	018	005	nor regard man, yet because this widow gives me trouble, I will do her justice, least by continually coming she weary me out.
042	LUK	018	006	And the Lord said, hear what even the unjust judge saith:
042	LUK	018	007	and will not God do justice for his elect that cry to Him day and night, though He bear long with them.
042	LUK	018	008	I tell you, He will avenge them speedily. And yet when the Son of man cometh, shall He find faith in the land?
042	LUK	018	009	And He spake also this parable to some that trusted in themselves as being righteous, and despised others.
042	LUK	018	010	Two men went up to the temple to pray; the one a pharisee and the other a publican.
042	LUK	018	011	The pharisee standing by himself prayed thus, O God, I thank thee that I am not as other men are, rapacious, unjust, adulterous, or even as this publican.
042	LUK	018	012	I fast twice a week, and I give tithes of all that I possess.
042	LUK	018	013	But the publican standing at a distance did not presume so much as to lift up his eyes to heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, O God, be merciful to me a sinner.
042	LUK	018	014	I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for whoever exalteth himself shall be abased, but he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.
042	LUK	018	015	And they brought to Him infants also, that He might touch them: and his disciples seeing it rebuked them.
042	LUK	018	016	But Jesus called them to Him and said, Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.
042	LUK	018	017	Verily I tell you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall by no means enter into it.
042	LUK	018	018	And a certain ruler asked Him, saying, Good master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?
042	LUK	018	019	And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is God.
042	LUK	018	020	Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother.
042	LUK	018	021	And he said, all these have I kept from my youth.
042	LUK	018	022	But when Jesus heard these things He said unto him, Thou yet wantest one thing, Sell all that thou hast, and distribute to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.
042	LUK	018	023	But when he heard this, he was very sorrowful; for he was very rich.
042	LUK	018	024	And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, He said, How difficultly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God?
042	LUK	018	025	For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
042	LUK	018	026	And they that heard it said, Who then can be saved?
042	LUK	018	027	But He answered, Things impossible with men are possible with God.
042	LUK	018	028	Then said Peter, Behold, we have quitted all, and followed Thee.
042	LUK	018	029	And He said unto them, Verily I tell you, there is no one that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the sake of the kingdom of God,
042	LUK	018	030	who shall not receive manifold more even in this life, and in the world to come life everlasting.
042	LUK	018	031	And He took the twelve with Him and said to them, Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all things written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished.
042	LUK	018	032	For He shall be delivered to the Gentiles, and insulted, and abused, and spit upon, and they will scourge Him, and put Him to death:
042	LUK	018	033	and the third day He shall rise again.
042	LUK	018	034	But they understood none of these things; and this matter was hid from them, so that they knew not the things which were spoken.
042	LUK	018	035	And as he was near to Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the way-side begging.
042	LUK	018	036	And hearing a multitude passing by, he asked what it meant.
042	LUK	018	037	And they told him, Jesus of Nazareth is coming by.
042	LUK	018	038	And he cried out, saying, Jesus, thou son of David, have compassion on me.
042	LUK	018	039	And they, that went before, rebuked him, that he might hold his peace, but he cried out the more, O Son of David, have pity on me.
042	LUK	018	040	So Jesus stopt, and ordered him to be brought to Him: and when he was come near,
042	LUK	018	041	He asked him, saying, What wouldst thou that I should do for thee? And he said, Lord, that I may recover my sight.
042	LUK	018	042	And Jesus said unto him, Receive thy sight: thy faith hath saved thee.
042	LUK	018	043	And immediately he received his sight, and followed Him, glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw it, gave praise unto God.
042	LUK	019	001	And Jesus having entred Jericho passed through the city,
042	LUK	019	002	and behold, there was a man named Zaccheus, who was the chief publican, and very rich.
042	LUK	019	003	And he sought to see Jesus who He was; but he could not for the croud; for he was little of stature.
042	LUK	019	004	And he ran before and got up into a sycamore-tree that he might see Him; for He was to pass by that way.
042	LUK	019	005	And when Jesus came to the place, He looked up and saw him, and said to him, Zaccheus, make haste and come down; for to-day I must abide at thy house.
042	LUK	019	006	And he made haste and came down, and received Him with joy.
042	LUK	019	007	And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, He is gone to be guest with a wicked man.
042	LUK	019	008	But Zaccheus stood up and said unto Jesus, Behold, Lord, the half of my substance I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any one wrongfully, I restore him fourfold.
042	LUK	019	009	Then said Jesus, This day is salvation come to this house, for as much as he also is a son of Abraham.
042	LUK	019	010	For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.
042	LUK	019	011	And as they listened to these things, He proceeded and spake a parable; because He was nigh to Jerusalem, and they thought that the kingdom of God would immediately be manifested.
042	LUK	019	012	He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a distant country to receive the investiture of a kingdom and then to return.
042	LUK	019	013	And he called ten of his servants, and delivered to them ten pounds, and said, Trade with them till I come.
042	LUK	019	014	But his citizens hated him, and sent an embassy after him, saying, We will not have this man to reign over us.
042	LUK	019	015	And when he was returned, having received the kingdom, he ordered these servants to be called to him, to whom he had delivered the money, that he might know what use each had made of it.
042	LUK	019	016	Then came the first and said, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten pounds.
042	LUK	019	017	And he said to him, Well done, thou good servant, as thou hast been faithful in a very little, thou shalt be governor over ten cities.
042	LUK	019	018	And the second came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath produced five pounds:
042	LUK	019	019	and he said to this likewise, Be thou also over five cities.
042	LUK	019	020	And another came, and said, Behold, my Lord, thy pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin:
042	LUK	019	021	for I was afraid of thee, because thou art an austere man, who takest up what thou didst not lay down, and reapest what thou didst not sow.
042	LUK	019	022	But he said to him, Out of thy own mouth will I judge thee, thou wicked servant, Thou knewest that I am an austere man, taking up what I laid not down, and reaping what I did not sow;
042	LUK	019	023	and why then didst thou not put my money into the bank, that when I came I might have received it with interest?
042	LUK	019	024	And he said to them that stood by, Take away the pound from him, and give it to him that hath the ten pounds.
042	LUK	019	025	(And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds already:)
042	LUK	019	026	for I tell you, that to every one that hath shall be given; but from him that hath not, even what he seemingly hath shall be taken away.
042	LUK	019	027	But those mine enemies, who would not have me to reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me.
042	LUK	019	028	And when He had said these things, He went forward, going up to Jerusalem.
042	LUK	019	029	And when He was nigh to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called the mount of Olives, He sent two of his disciples,
042	LUK	019	030	saying, Go into the opposite village, in which, at your entring, ye will find a colt tied, on which no man ever yet sat; loose him and bring him hither.
042	LUK	019	031	And if any one ask you, Why do ye loose him? thus shall ye say unto him, The Lord hath need of him.
042	LUK	019	032	And they that were sent, went away and found it as He had told them.
042	LUK	019	033	But as they were untying the colt, the owners of it said to them, Why do ye untie the colt?
042	LUK	019	034	and they answered, The Lord hath need of him.
042	LUK	019	035	And they brought him to Jesus: and throwing their garments upon the colt they set Jesus thereon.
042	LUK	019	036	And as He went along they spread their clothes under Him in the way.
042	LUK	019	037	And when He was now come near to the foot of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples rejoicing began to praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works which they had seen,
042	LUK	019	038	saying, Blessed be the king that cometh in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest!
042	LUK	019	039	And some of the pharisees from among the multitude said to Him, Master, rebuke thy disciples.
042	LUK	019	040	And He answered them, I tell you, that if these were silent, the very stones would cry out.
042	LUK	019	041	And as He drew near, beholding the city, He wept over it,
042	LUK	019	042	saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at lest in this thy day, the things relating to thy peace--- but now they are hid from thine eyes.
042	LUK	019	043	For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast up a trench about thee, and surround thee, and keep thee in on every side,
042	LUK	019	044	and shall lay thee to the ground, and thy children within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another: because thou didst not regard the time of thy visitation.
042	LUK	019	045	And He went into the temple, and cast out those that were buying and selling in it,
042	LUK	019	046	saying unto them, It is written, "my house is the house of prayer: but ye have made it a den of thieves."
042	LUK	019	047	And He was teaching daily in the temple: but the chief priests and the scribes and the rulers of the people sought to destroy Him;
042	LUK	019	048	and could not find how to effect it: for all the people were attentive to hear Him.
042	LUK	020	001	And on one of those days as He was teaching the people in the temple and preaching the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes and elders came upon Him, saying,
042	LUK	020	002	Tell us by what authority thou dost these things? or who it is that gave thee this authority?
042	LUK	020	003	And He answered and said unto them, I will also ask you one question, tell me,
042	LUK	020	004	Was the baptism of John from heaven or from men?
042	LUK	020	005	And they reasoned among themselves, saying, If we say, From heaven, He will say, Why then did ye not believe him?
042	LUK	020	006	but if we say, Of men, the people will all stone us: for they are persuaded that John was a prophet.
042	LUK	020	007	And they answered, they did not know whence it was.
042	LUK	020	008	And Jesus said unto them, Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.
042	LUK	020	009	Then He began to speak unto the people this parable, A certain man planted a vineyard, and let it out to husbandmen and travelled abroad for a considerable time,
042	LUK	020	010	and at the fruit-season he sent a servant to the husbandmen that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard; but the husbandmen beat him and sent him away empty.
042	LUK	020	011	And he sent another servant; and they beat him also and abused him, and sent him away empty.
042	LUK	020	012	And he sent a third; and they wounded him also and drove him out.
042	LUK	020	013	Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son: perhaps when they see Him they will reverence Him.
042	LUK	020	014	But when the husbandmen saw Him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir, come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.
042	LUK	020	015	So they cast him out of the vineyard and killed him. What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do unto them?
042	LUK	020	016	He will come and destroy these husbandmen, and will give the vineyard to others. And when they heard this they said, God forbid.
042	LUK	020	017	And He looked upon them and said, What then is this, which is written, The stone which the builders refused, is become the head of the corner?
042	LUK	020	018	Whosoever falleth on that stone shall be bruised; but on whomsoever it falleth, it will crush him to pieces.
042	LUK	020	019	And the chief priests and the scribes would have laid hands on Him at that very time, but were afraid of the people: for they perceived that He had spoken this parable against them.
042	LUK	020	020	And they watched Him and sent out spies, pretending to be righteous men, to lay hold of his words, that they might deliver Him up to the power and authority of the governor.
042	LUK	020	021	And they asked Him, saying, Master, we know that thou speakest and teachest rightly, and acceptest not the person of any, but teachest the way of God in truth:
042	LUK	020	022	is it lawful for us to give tribute to Cesar, or not?
042	LUK	020	023	But He perceived their craftiness, and said unto them, Why do ye tempt me?
042	LUK	020	024	Shew me a penny: whose image and inscription hath it? and they answered, Cesar's.
042	LUK	020	025	Then said He unto them, Render therefore unto Cesar the things that are Cesar's, and to God the things that are God's.
042	LUK	020	026	And they could not take hold of his word before the people: and they marvelled at his answer and said no more.
042	LUK	020	027	And some of the Sadducees (who deny a resurrection) came to Him and asked Him,
042	LUK	020	028	saying, Moses enjoined us, if any man's brother die, having a wife, and he die childless, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed to his brother.
042	LUK	020	029	Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and died childless; and the second took the wife, and he died childless;
042	LUK	020	030	and the third took her;
042	LUK	020	031	and in like manner all the seven.
042	LUK	020	032	And they died and left no children. Last of all the woman also died.
042	LUK	020	033	Therefore at the resurrection whose wife is she? for all the seven had her to wife.
042	LUK	020	034	And Jesus answering said unto them, The children of this world marry and are given in marriage.
042	LUK	020	035	But they who are counted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:
042	LUK	020	036	for they can die no more, being like the angels: and they are the children of God as being the children of the resurrection.
042	LUK	020	037	Now that the dead are raised, even Moses shewed at the bush; for he calleth the Lord, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.
042	LUK	020	038	And He is not the God of the dead, but of the living; for to Him they are all living.
042	LUK	020	039	And some of the scribes replied, Master, thou hast indeed said right.
042	LUK	020	040	And they dared not any more to ask Him any such question.
042	LUK	020	041	And He said unto them, How do they say, that Christ is the son of David?
042	LUK	020	042	when David himself saith in the book of Psalms, "The Lord said unto my Lord,
042	LUK	020	043	Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool."
042	LUK	020	044	David therefore calleth Him Lord, and how is He then his son?
042	LUK	020	045	And He said to his disciples, in the audience of all the people,
042	LUK	020	046	Beware of the scribes, who affect to walk in long robes, and love salutations in public places, and the chief seats in the Synagogues, and uppermost places at feasts;
042	LUK	020	047	who devour widows houses, and for a shew of religion make long prayers: these shall receive a heavier sentence.
042	LUK	021	001	And He looked up and saw the rich people bringing their gifts to the treasury:
042	LUK	021	002	and He saw also a poor widow throwing in two mites.
042	LUK	021	003	And He said, Verily I tell you, this poor widow hath put in more than they all.
042	LUK	021	004	For all these have out of their abundance contributed to the offerings of God: but she out of her penury hath given all she had.
042	LUK	021	005	And as some were speaking of the temple; how it was adorned with beautiful stones and gifts, He said, As for these things which ye see,
042	LUK	021	006	the days will come, in which there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be demolished.
042	LUK	021	007	And they asked Him, saying, Master, when shall these things be? And what will be the sign when these things shall come to pass?
042	LUK	021	008	And He said, Take heed that ye be not deceived; for many shall come in my name, saying, I am the Christ; and the time is near: but do not therefore go after them.
042	LUK	021	009	And when ye shall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified: for these must first happen; but the end will not be directly.
042	LUK	021	010	Then said He unto them, Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom;
042	LUK	021	011	and there will be great earthquakes in several places, and famines, and pestilences, and fearful sights and great prodigies from heaven.
042	LUK	021	012	But before all these things they will lay hands on you, and persecute you, delivering you up to synagogues, and prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for my name's sake:
042	LUK	021	013	but it shall be for a testimony to you.
042	LUK	021	014	Fix it therefore in your hearts not to premeditate a defence: for I will give you a mouth and wisdom,
042	LUK	021	015	which all your adversaries shall not be able to contradict nor withstand.
042	LUK	021	016	But ye shall be betrayed even by parents, and brethren, and kindred and friends; and some of you shall they cause to be put to death:
042	LUK	021	017	and ye will be hated by all men for my sake.
042	LUK	021	018	But not an hair of your head shall perish.
042	LUK	021	019	In your patience therefore possess your souls.
042	LUK	021	020	And when ye shall see Jerusalem surrounded with armies, then know that the desolation thereof is nigh: then let them that are in Judea flee to the mountains,
042	LUK	021	021	and those that are in the midst of it, depart; and let not them that are in the countries enter into it.
042	LUK	021	022	For these are days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled.
042	LUK	021	023	But wo to them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days; for there shall be great distress in the land, and wrath upon this people,
042	LUK	021	024	and they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and be led captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trampled down by the Gentiles, till the times of the Gentiles too shall be fulfilled.
042	LUK	021	025	And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and on the earth distress of nations in perplexity, the sea and the waves roring:
042	LUK	021	026	and men ready to die for fear and apprehension of the things that are coming upon the land; for the powers of heaven shall be shaken.
042	LUK	021	027	And then shall they see the Son of man coming, as on a cloud, with power and great glory.
042	LUK	021	028	But when these things begin to come to pass, look upwards and lift up your heads, for your redemption draweth nigh.
042	LUK	021	029	And He spake a parable to them, Behold the fig-tree,
042	LUK	021	030	and all the trees, when they shoot out, ye see and know of yourselves that summer is now near:
042	LUK	021	031	so likewise know ye, when ye see these things coming to pass, that the kingdom of God is at hand.
042	LUK	021	032	Verily I tell you, this generation shall not pass away till all be accomplished.
042	LUK	021	033	Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.
042	LUK	021	034	Take heed to yourselves, least at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness, and the cares of life, and so that day should come upon you unawares:
042	LUK	021	035	for as a snare shall it come upon all that dwell on the face of the whole earth.
042	LUK	021	036	Watch therefore and be constant in prayer, that ye may be counted worthy to escape all these things, which shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.
042	LUK	021	037	Thus He was by day teaching in the temple; and at night He retired to the mount called the mount of Olives.
042	LUK	021	038	And all the people came early in the morning to Him in the temple to hear Him.
042	LUK	022	001	Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is called the passover.
042	LUK	022	002	And the chief priests and scribes were consulting how they might put Him to death; for they were afraid of the people.
042	LUK	022	003	Then entred Satan into Judas who was surnamed Iscariot, one of the twelve.
042	LUK	022	004	And he went and conferred with the chief priests and the captains, how he might betray Him unto them.
042	LUK	022	005	And they were glad and agreed to give him money:
042	LUK	022	006	and he accepted the terms, and sought an opportunity to betray Him unto them in the absence of the multitude.
042	LUK	022	007	The day of unleavened bread being come, on which the paschal-lamb was to be slain,
042	LUK	022	008	Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare the passover for us, that we may eat of it.
042	LUK	022	009	And they said unto Him, Where wouldst thou have us prepare it?
042	LUK	022	010	And He said unto them, Behold, when ye are come into the city, there shall meet you a man, carrying a pitcher of water, follow him into the house where he entreth:
042	LUK	022	011	and say to the master of the house, Our Master inquireth by us, Where is the room, in which I may eat the passover with my disciples?
042	LUK	022	012	And he will shew you a large upper room set out; there make it ready.
042	LUK	022	013	And they went and found as He had told them; and prepared the passover.
042	LUK	022	014	And when the hour was come, He sat down and the twelve apostles with Him.
042	LUK	022	015	And He said unto them, I have earnestly desired to eat of this passover with you before I suffer:
042	LUK	022	016	for I say unto you, that I will not eat of it any more, till it be accomplished in the kingdom of God.
042	LUK	022	017	And taking the cup He gave thanks and said, Take this and distribute it among yourselves.
042	LUK	022	018	For I tell you, that I will not drink again of the fruit of the vine, till the kingdom of God shall come.
042	LUK	022	019	And He took bread, and gave thanks and brake it, and gave it to them, saying, This is my body which is given for you; do this in remembrance of me:
042	LUK	022	020	as also the cup after supper, saying, This cup represents the new covenant in my blood, which is shed for you.
042	LUK	022	021	And yet behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is at table with me:
042	LUK	022	022	and the Son of man is going indeed as was determined; but wo to that man by whom He is betrayed.
042	LUK	022	023	And they began to enquire among themselves, which of them it was that should do it.
042	LUK	022	024	And there was also a dispute among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest:
042	LUK	022	025	but He said unto them, The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those in authority are called benefactors.
042	LUK	022	026	But ye shall not do so: but let the greatest among you be as the younger; and he that presides as he that serveth.
042	LUK	022	027	For which is greater, he that sitteth at table, or he that serveth? is not he that sitteth at table? but I am among you as one that serveth.
042	LUK	022	028	Ye have continued with me in my temptations;
042	LUK	022	029	and I appoint you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me:
042	LUK	022	030	that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit upon thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
042	LUK	022	031	And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you my disciples, that he may sift you as wheat:
042	LUK	022	032	but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith may not fail; and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.
042	LUK	022	033	And he said unto Him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee both to prison and to death.
042	LUK	022	034	But He replied, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before thou hast thrice denied that thou knowest me.
042	LUK	022	035	And He said unto them, When I sent you forth without purse, or bag, or shoes, did ye want any thing? and they said, Nothing.
042	LUK	022	036	Then said He unto them, But now let him, that hath a purse, take it, and his bag likewise; and let him that has no sword, sell his garment and buy one:
042	LUK	022	037	for I tell you, that this which is written must yet be accomplished in me, "And He was numbered with transgressors," for the things foretold concerning me are near at an end.
042	LUK	022	038	And they said, Lord, behold here are two swords. And He said unto them, It is enough.
042	LUK	022	039	And He came out and went, as He used to do, to the mount of Olives; and his disciples also followed Him.
042	LUK	022	040	And when He was at the place, He said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation.
042	LUK	022	041	And when He was withdrawn from them about a stone's-cast, He kneeled down and prayed saying,
042	LUK	022	042	Father, if thou art willing take away this cup from me---nevertheless, not my will but thine be done.
042	LUK	022	043	And there appeared to Him an angel from heaven strengthening Him.
042	LUK	022	044	And being in agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was like clotted blood falling down upon the ground.
042	LUK	022	045	And when He rose up from prayer, He came to his disciples and found them sleeping for sorrow;
042	LUK	022	046	and He said to them, Why do ye sleep? rise and pray, that ye enter not into temptation.
042	LUK	022	047	And while He was yet speaking, behold a multitude; and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve apostles, came before them, and drew near unto Jesus to kiss Him:
042	LUK	022	048	and Jesus said to him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?
042	LUK	022	049	But when they that were about Him saw what would follow, they said to Him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?
042	LUK	022	050	And one of them smote the high priest's servant and cut off his right ear:
042	LUK	022	051	but Jesus said, Suffer ye thus far; and He touched his ear and healed him.
042	LUK	022	052	Then said Jesus to the chief priests, and officers of the temple, and elders, that were come to Him, Are ye come out as against a robber with swords and clubs?
042	LUK	022	053	When I was day after day with you in the temple, ye did not stretch out your hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.
042	LUK	022	054	Then they took Him and led Him away, and brought Him to the high priest's. And Peter followed at a distance.
042	LUK	022	055	And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and sat down together, Peter also sat down among them:
042	LUK	022	056	and a servant-maid seeing him as he sat by the fire, and looking hard at him, said, This fellow was also with Him:
042	LUK	022	057	But he denied Him, saying, Woman, I do not know Him.
042	LUK	022	058	And after a little while another person seeing him said, And thou art one of them: but Peter said, Man, I am not.
042	LUK	022	059	And about an hour after, another confidently affirmed saying, In truth this fellow also was with Him; for he is a Galilean too: but Peter answered,
042	LUK	022	060	Man, I know not what thou sayst. And immediately, while he was yet speaking, the cock crew.
042	LUK	022	061	And the Lord turned and looked upon Peter; and Peter called to mind the word of the Lord, how He had said to him, Before the cock crow thou wilt deny me thrice.
042	LUK	022	062	And Peter went out and wept bitterly.
042	LUK	022	063	And the men that laid hold on Jesus, insulted and abused Him;
042	LUK	022	064	and when they had blind-folded Him, they struck Him on the face, and asked Him, saying, Prophesy who it was that smote thee.
042	LUK	022	065	And many other things spake they against Him, blaspheming Him.
042	LUK	022	066	And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people, and chief-priests, and scribes, assembled together, and ordered Him up into their council:
042	LUK	022	067	and said to Him, Art thou the Messiah? tell us. And He said unto them, If I should tell you, ye would not believe:
042	LUK	022	068	and if I should put any question to you, ye would not answer me, nor discharge me.
042	LUK	022	069	But hereafter shall the Son of man be seated on the right hand of the power of God.
042	LUK	022	070	And they all said, Art thou then the Son of God?
042	LUK	022	071	And He said unto them, I am. And they said, What need have we of any farther evidence? when we ourselves have it from his own mouth?
042	LUK	023	001	Then they all rose up and led Him to Pilate.
042	LUK	023	002	And they began to accuse Him, saying, We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbiding to give tribute to Cesar; saying, that He himself is Christ the king.
042	LUK	023	003	And Pilate asked Him, saying, Art thou the king of the Jews? And He answered him and said, I am as thou sayest.
042	LUK	023	004	But Pilate said to the chief priests, and to the people, I find nothing criminal in this man.
042	LUK	023	005	Then they were more vehement, saying, He stirreth up the people to sedition, spreading his doctrine throughout all Judea: having begun at Galilee and come even to this place.
042	LUK	023	006	Now when Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked, if the man were a Galilean:
042	LUK	023	007	and understanding that He was of Herod's jurisdiction, he sent Him to Herod, who was also at Jerusalem at that time.
042	LUK	023	008	And Herod, when he saw Jesus, was very glad; for he had of a long time been desirous to see Him, because he had heard much of Him, and he hoped to see some miracle wrought by Him.
042	LUK	023	009	And he asked Him many questions; but He answered him nothing:
042	LUK	023	010	though the chief priests and scribes stood vehemently accusing Him.
042	LUK	023	011	But Herod with his soldiers set Him at nought and insulted Him, and put on Him a gaudy robe, and sent Him back to Pilate.
042	LUK	023	012	And on that same day Pilate and Herod became friends with each other: for before they were at enmity one with the other.
042	LUK	023	013	And Pilate called together the chief priests, and the rulers,
042	LUK	023	014	and the people, and said unto them, Ye have brought to me this man as one that perverteth the people: and behold I have examined Him before you, and found nothing chargeable on Him, of the things you alledge against Him:
042	LUK	023	015	nor Herod neither; for I sent you to him, and behold nothing worthy of death is proved upon Him.
042	LUK	023	016	I will therefore chastise Him, and so release Him.
042	LUK	023	017	Now he was obliged to release one to them at the feast.
042	LUK	023	018	And they all cried out, saying, Away with this man, and release to us Barabbas:
042	LUK	023	019	(who for a riot in the city, and for murder, was committed to prison:)
042	LUK	023	020	Pilate therefore spake to them again, being desirous to release Jesus.
042	LUK	023	021	But they bawled out, saying, Crucify Him, crucify Him.
042	LUK	023	022	And he said to them a third time, what evil hath He done? I have found nothing in Him deserving death: I will therefore chastise Him, and let Him go.
042	LUK	023	023	But they insisted upon it with loud clamours, demanding Him to be crucified: and their voices and those of the chief priests prevailed.
042	LUK	023	024	So Pilate gave sentence that what they demanded should be done.
042	LUK	023	025	And he released to them him that for sedition and murder had been cast into prison, whom they desired; and delivered up Jesus to their will.
042	LUK	023	026	And when they led Him away, they laid hold on one Simon a Cyrenean coming out of the country, and put the cross on him to bear it behind Jesus.
042	LUK	023	027	And there followed Him a great multitude of people, and of women, who also bewailed and lamented Him: but Jesus turning to them said,
042	LUK	023	028	Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.
042	LUK	023	029	For behold the days are coming in which they shall say, happy are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the breasts that never gave suck.
042	LUK	023	030	Then shall they say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us:
042	LUK	023	031	for if they do these things to the green wood, what shall be done to the dry?
042	LUK	023	032	And there were also two other malefactors led with Him to be put to death.
042	LUK	023	033	And when they were come to the place which is called Calvary, there they crucified Him and the malefactors: one on his right hand and the other on his left.
042	LUK	023	034	And Jesus said, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his garments, and cast lots for them.
042	LUK	023	035	And the people stood looking on, and even the rulers also with them derided Him, saying, He saved others, let Him save Himself, if He be the Christ the chosen of God.
042	LUK	023	036	And the soldiers too insulted Him, coming to Him and offering Him vinegar, saying,
042	LUK	023	037	If thou art the king of the Jews, save thyself.
042	LUK	023	038	And there was a superscription written over Him in Greek, and Latin and Hebrew letters, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
042	LUK	023	039	And one of the malefactors that were executed with Him reviled Him, saying, If thou be the Messiah, save thyself and us.
042	LUK	023	040	But the other answered and rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God neither, when thou thyself art in the same condemnation?
042	LUK	023	041	And we indeed justly; for we receive the due rewards of our deeds, but this man hath done nothing amiss.
042	LUK	023	042	And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.
042	LUK	023	043	And Jesus answered him, I assure thee, thou shalt be with me this day in paradise.
042	LUK	023	044	Now it was about the sixth hour, and there was darkness over the whole land till the ninth hour.
042	LUK	023	045	And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.
042	LUK	023	046	And Jesus cried with a loud voice and said, Father, into thy hands I commit my spirit. And when He had said thus, He expired.
042	LUK	023	047	And when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this man was righteous.
042	LUK	023	048	And all the multitudes that came together to this affecting sight, seeing what happened, smote on their breasts and returned.
042	LUK	023	049	And all his acquaintance stood at a distance, and the women that followed Him from Galilee, beholding these things.
042	LUK	023	050	And behold there was a man of Arimathea, a city of the Jews, named Joseph, a counsellor, a good man and a just:
042	LUK	023	051	(who had not consented to their counsel nor their action; and who was also himself in expectation of the kingdom of God:)
042	LUK	023	052	he came to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus:
042	LUK	023	053	and he took it down and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre hewn in stone, where no one had ever yet been laid.
042	LUK	023	054	Now that day was the preparation, and the sabbath was coming on:
042	LUK	023	055	wherefore the women, that came with Him from Galilee, followed Joseph, and saw the sepulchre, and how the body was laid:
042	LUK	023	056	but returned and prepared spices and perfumes; and then rested on the sabbath-day, according to the commandment.
042	LUK	024	001	And on the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came to the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared; (and some others with them:) and found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre:
042	LUK	024	002	so they went in,
042	LUK	024	003	but found not the body of the Lord Jesus.
042	LUK	024	004	And while they were in perplexity about it, behold, two men stood by them in shining robes.
042	LUK	024	005	And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the ground, the men said unto them, Why do ye seek the living among the dead?
042	LUK	024	006	He is not here, He is risen: remember how He spake to you, when He was yet in Galilee,
042	LUK	024	007	saying, the Son of man must be delivered into the hands of wicked men, and be crucified; and the third day rise again.
042	LUK	024	008	And they remembered his words,
042	LUK	024	009	and returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things to the eleven apostles, and to all the rest.
042	LUK	024	010	Now it was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and the other women with them, that told these things to the apostles:
042	LUK	024	011	and their words appeared to them as an idle tale, and they did not believe them.
042	LUK	024	012	But Peter arose and ran to the sepulchre; and stooping down he saw the linen cloths lying by themselves: and he went away, wondering in himself at what had happened.
042	LUK	024	013	And behold two of them were going that day to a village about threescore furlongs from Jerusalem, called Emmaus.
042	LUK	024	014	And they were conversing together about all these things which had happened.
042	LUK	024	015	And while they were discoursing and reasoning together, Jesus himself drew near and went along with them.
042	LUK	024	016	But their eyes were so restrained that they did not know Him.
042	LUK	024	017	And He said unto them, What subjects are these, which ye are discoursing of to one another as ye walk, and why are ye sorrowful?
042	LUK	024	018	And one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answered and said to Him, Art thou only a sojourner at Jerusalem, and hast not heard of the things which have been done there within these few days?
042	LUK	024	019	And He said unto them, What things? And they replied, Those concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet powerful both in work and word before God and all the people:
042	LUK	024	020	how the chief priests and our rulers delivered Him to be condemned to death, and crucified Him.
042	LUK	024	021	But we hoped that it was He that would have delivered Israel: and besides all this, to-day is the third day since these things were done.
042	LUK	024	022	And indeed some women of our company much surprised us: who having been early at the sepulchre,
042	LUK	024	023	and not finding his body there, came and said likewise that they had seen a vision of angels, who said He was alive.
042	LUK	024	024	And some of those that were with us went to the sepulchre, and found it so as the women had said: but Him they did not see.
042	LUK	024	025	And He said unto them, O people void of understanding and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken.
042	LUK	024	026	Was not the Messiah to suffer these things, and so to enter into his glory?
042	LUK	024	027	And beginning from Moses, and all the prophets, He explained to them in all the scriptures the things that were spoken concerning Himself.
042	LUK	024	028	And they drew nigh to the village whither they were going: and He made as if He was going farther.
042	LUK	024	029	And they pressed Him, saying, Stay with us, for it is towards evening, and the day is far spent. And He went in to tarry with them.
042	LUK	024	030	And as He sat at table with them, He took bread and blessed it, and then brake it and gave to them.
042	LUK	024	031	And their eyes were opened, and they knew Him.
042	LUK	024	032	And He disappeared from them. And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, as He was talking with us by the way, and while He was opening to us the scriptures?
042	LUK	024	033	And they rose up immediately and returned to Jerusalem; and sound the eleven and others with them assembled together, saying,
042	LUK	024	034	The Lord is risen indeed, and hath been seen by Simon.
042	LUK	024	035	Then these also related what had happened by the way, and how He became known to them in breaking of bread.
042	LUK	024	036	And as they were thus speaking, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be to you.
042	LUK	024	037	But they being terrified and frighted, thought they saw a spirit.
042	LUK	024	038	And He said to them, Why are ye troubled? and why do such thoughts rise in your hearts?
042	LUK	024	039	Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.
042	LUK	024	040	And when He said this, He shewed them his hands and feet.
042	LUK	024	041	But they not yet believing for joy, and being amazed, He said to them, Have ye here any thing to eat?
042	LUK	024	042	And they gave Him part of a broiled fish and some honey-comb:
042	LUK	024	043	and He took, and did eat before them.
042	LUK	024	044	And He said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all the things must be fulfilled, which are written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and Psalms, concerning me.
042	LUK	024	045	Then He opened their mind, to understand the scriptures:
042	LUK	024	046	and said unto them, thus it is written, and thus it was necessary that the Christ should suffer, and rise again from the dead on the third day;
042	LUK	024	047	and that in his name should be preached repentance and remission of sins to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.
042	LUK	024	048	And ye are witnesses of these things: and I will send upon you the promise of my Father;
042	LUK	024	049	but do ye continue in the city of Jerusalem, till ye are endued with power from on high.
042	LUK	024	050	And He led them out as far as to Bethany: and lifted up his hands and blessed them.
042	LUK	024	051	And while He was blessing them, He was parted from them, and was carried up into heaven.
042	LUK	024	052	And they worshipped Him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy.
042	LUK	024	053	And they were constantly in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.

# BOOK	043	JOH	John	John
043	JOH	001	001	In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
043	JOH	001	002	The same was in the beginning with God.
043	JOH	001	003	By Him were all things made, and without Him was not any one thing made that was made.
043	JOH	001	004	In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.
043	JOH	001	005	And the light shineth in darkness, and the darkness attained it not.
043	JOH	001	006	There was a man sent from God, whose name was John:
043	JOH	001	007	this man came for witness, that he might testify concerning the light, that through him all might believe.
043	JOH	001	008	He was not that light, but was sent to bear witness of the light.
043	JOH	001	009	The true light was that which enlightneth every man that cometh into the world.
043	JOH	001	010	He was in the world, and the world was made by Him, and yet the world knew Him not:
043	JOH	001	011	yea, He came to his own peculiar right, and even his own people received Him not.
043	JOH	001	012	But as many as received Him, to them granted He the privilege to become the children of God, even to them that believe on his name;
043	JOH	001	013	who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.
043	JOH	001	014	And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, being full of grace and truth: and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only-begotten of the Father.
043	JOH	001	015	Of Him did John bare witness, and publicly declared, saying, This was He of whom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me; for He was before me.
043	JOH	001	016	And of his fulness have we all received, even grace for grace.
043	JOH	001	017	For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ:
043	JOH	001	018	and though no one hath ever seen God, or can see Him: yet the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, hath made Him known.
043	JOH	001	019	And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent from Jerusalem priests and Levites to ask him, Who art thou?
043	JOH	001	020	he confessed, and denied not; but declared openly, I am not the Christ.
043	JOH	001	021	And they asked him, What then? art thou Elias? And he said, I am not. Art thou a prophet? and he answered, No.
043	JOH	001	022	Therefore said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us: What dost thou say of thy self?
043	JOH	001	023	and he said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, "Make straight the way of the Lord," according to Esaias the prophet.
043	JOH	001	024	Now they that were sent, were of the pharisees:
043	JOH	001	025	and they asked him, and said to him, Why then dost thou baptize, if thou art not the Christ, nor Elias, nor a prophet?
043	JOH	001	026	John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not;
043	JOH	001	027	that cometh after me, but is preferred before me, the latchet of whose shoe I am not worthy to unloose.
043	JOH	001	028	These things passed at Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.
043	JOH	001	029	The next day John seeth Jesus coming towards him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world.
043	JOH	001	030	This is He of whom I said, After me cometh a man, who is preferred before me: for He was before me.
043	JOH	001	031	And I knew Him not: but therefore came I baptizing with water, that He might be made known to Israel.
043	JOH	001	032	And John testified saying, I saw the Spirit descending like a dove from heaven, and it abode upon Him.
043	JOH	001	033	And I knew Him not: but He that sent me to baptize with water, said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding on Him, the same is he that baptizeth with the Holy Spirit.
043	JOH	001	034	And I saw it, and therefore testified that this is the Son of God.
043	JOH	001	035	The day following John was standing, (and two of his disciples,)
043	JOH	001	036	and looking upon Jesus as He was walking, he saith, "Behold the lamb of God."
043	JOH	001	037	And when the two disciples heard what he said, they followed Jesus.
043	JOH	001	038	And Jesus turning, and seeing them following Him, saith unto them, What do ye seek? They said unto Him, Rabbi (that is to say, Master,) where is thine abode?
043	JOH	001	039	He saith unto them, Come and see. And they came and saw where He dwelt, and abode with Him that day: and it was about the tenth hour.
043	JOH	001	040	Now Andrew the brother of Simon Peter, was one of the two that heard what John said, and thereupon followed Jesus.
043	JOH	001	041	He first meeteth with his own brother Simon, and telleth him, "We have found the Messiah, which is to say, the Christ."
043	JOH	001	042	And Andrew brought him to Jesus: and Jesus looking at him said, Thou art Simon the son of Jonas, thou shalt be called Cephas; which is interpreted a stone.
043	JOH	001	043	The day following Jesus had a mind to go out into Galilee, and meeting with Philip, saith unto him, Follow me.
043	JOH	001	044	Now Philip was of Bethsaida the city of Andrew and Peter.
043	JOH	001	045	Philip meeting Nathaniel, saith unto him, We have found Him, of whom Moses in the law, and of whom the prophets also wrote, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Jeseph.
043	JOH	001	046	And Nathaniel said unto him, Can any thing good come out of Nazareth? Philip replied, Come and see.
043	JOH	001	047	And when Jesus saw Nathaniel coming towards Him, He saith concerning him, "Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile."
043	JOH	001	048	Nathaniel saith unto Him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered him, Before Philip called thee, I saw thee, when under the fig-tree.
043	JOH	001	049	Nathaniel replied, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the king of Israel.
043	JOH	001	050	Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I told thee that I saw thee under the fig-tree, thou believest: thou shalt see greater things than these.
043	JOH	001	051	And He saith unto him, Verily verily I say unto you, Ye shall hereafter see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.
043	JOH	002	001	And on the third day after, there was a marriage at Cana of Galilee: and the mother of Jesus was there.
043	JOH	002	002	And Jesus and his disciples were invited to the wedding.
043	JOH	002	003	And the wine falling short, the mother of Jesus saith unto Him, They have no wine.
043	JOH	002	004	Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? my time is not yet come.
043	JOH	002	005	His mother saith to the servants, Whatsoever he ordereth you to do, do it.
043	JOH	002	006	And there were six stone waterpots, placed according to the custom of purifying among the Jews, containing each about two or three firkins.
043	JOH	002	007	Jesus saith unto them, Fill the water-pots with water: and they filled them up to the brim.
043	JOH	002	008	And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and carry it to the master of the feast. And they carried it to him.
043	JOH	002	009	And when the manager of the feast had tasted the water which was made wine, and knew not whence it was, (but the servants, that drew the water, knew,) he called the bride-groom,
043	JOH	002	010	and saith unto him, Every man sets out good wine at first, and when they have drank plentifully, then that which is worse; but thou hast keep the good wine till now.
043	JOH	002	011	This beginning of his miracles Jesus wrought at Cana of Galilee, and made manifest his glory: and his disciples believed on Him.
043	JOH	002	012	After this He went down to Capernaum, He and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: but they staid there not many days.
043	JOH	002	013	For the passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. And He found in the temple those that sold oxen,
043	JOH	002	014	and sheep, and doves, and the money changers sitting:
043	JOH	002	015	and having made a whip of small cords He drove them all, out of the temple; with the sheep and the oxen: and He poured out the changers money, and threw down the tables.
043	JOH	002	016	And said to them that sold doves, Take away these things from hence, and make not my Father's house an house of traffick.
043	JOH	002	017	And his disciples remembered that it is written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up.
043	JOH	002	018	The Jews therefore answered and said unto Him, What sign dost thou shew us, seeing thou dost these things?
043	JOH	002	019	Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up again: then said the Jews,
043	JOH	002	020	Forty and six years has this temple been in building, and wilt thou raise it up in three days? but He spake of the temple of his body.
043	JOH	002	021	Therefore when he was risen from the dead,
043	JOH	002	022	his disciples remembered, that He had said this to them: and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.
043	JOH	002	023	And when he was in Jerusalem at the passover on the feast-day, many believed in his name, seeing his miracles, which He wrought.
043	JOH	002	024	But Jesus did not trust Himself to them;
043	JOH	002	025	for He knew all men, and He had no need that any should testify concerning man; for He knew what was in man.
043	JOH	003	001	Now there was a man of the pharisees, whose name was Nicodemus, a ruler among the Jews:
043	JOH	003	002	who came to Jesus by night, and said unto Him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for none can do these miracles which thou dost, unless God be with him.
043	JOH	003	003	Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily verily I tell thee, Unless a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.
043	JOH	003	004	Nicodemus saith unto Him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter a second time into his mother's womb, and be born?
043	JOH	003	005	Jesus answered, I tell thee of a truth, Unless a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.
043	JOH	003	006	That, which is born of the flesh, is flesh; and that, which is born of the Spirit, is spirit.
043	JOH	003	007	Do not wonder that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.
043	JOH	003	008	As the wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound of it, but knowest not whence it cometh, or whither it goeth; so is every one that is born of the Spirit.
043	JOH	003	009	Nicodemus answered and said unto Him, How can these things be?
043	JOH	003	010	Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a teacher of Israel and knowest not these things?
043	JOH	003	011	I assure thee, that we speak what we know, and testify what we have seen; though ye receive not our testimony.
043	JOH	003	012	If I have told you earthly things and ye believe not, how will ye believe if I should tell you heavenly ones?
043	JOH	003	013	For no one hath ascended up into heaven, but He that came down from heaven, even the Son of man who is in heaven.
043	JOH	003	014	And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of man be lifted up:
043	JOH	003	015	that whosoever believeth on Him may not perish, but have eternal life.
043	JOH	003	016	For God so loved the world, that He gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on Him might not perish, but have everlasting life:
043	JOH	003	017	for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved by Him.
043	JOH	003	018	He that believeth on Him is not condemned: but he that believeth not, is already condemned; because he hath not believed on the name of the only-begotten Son of God.
043	JOH	003	019	And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.
043	JOH	003	020	For every one that doth evil, hateth the light; and he cometh not to the light, least his deeds should be reproved.
043	JOH	003	021	But he that acts according to truth, cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.
043	JOH	003	022	After these things came Jesus, and his disciples into the land of Judea: and He stayed with them there, and baptized.
043	JOH	003	023	And John also was baptizing in Enon near Salim; because there was much water there: and people came to him and were baptized.
043	JOH	003	024	For John was not yet cast into prison.
043	JOH	003	025	Now there arose a dispute between some of the disciples of John, and the Jews, about purifying.
043	JOH	003	026	And they came to John, and said unto him, Rabbi, He that was with thee on the other side Jordan, to whom thou barest testimony, behold, He baptizeth and all the people come to Him.
043	JOH	003	027	John answered and said, A man can take nothing upon him, unless it be given him from heaven.
043	JOH	003	028	Ye your selves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but am sent before Him.
043	JOH	003	029	He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, who standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth with great joy at the bridegroom's voice. Therefore my joy is complete.
043	JOH	003	030	He must increase, but I must decrease.
043	JOH	003	031	He, that cometh from above, is above all: he that is of the earth, is earthly, and talketh like one of the earth:
043	JOH	003	032	but He that cometh from heaven, is above all: and what He hath seen and heard, this He testifieth: and yet scarce any one receiveth his testimony.
043	JOH	003	033	He that hath received his testimony, hath set his seal to this, that God is true:
043	JOH	003	034	for He, whom God hath sent, speaketh the words of God: for God giveth the Spirit to Him not by measure.
043	JOH	003	035	The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all into his hand:
043	JOH	003	036	wherefore he that believeth on the Son, hath eternal life; and he that obeyeth not the Son, shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.
043	JOH	004	001	Therefore when the Lord knew, the pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,
043	JOH	004	002	(though Jesus Himself did not baptize, but his disciples,)
043	JOH	004	003	He left Judea, and departed again into Galilee.
043	JOH	004	004	And as He must pass through the country of Samaria, He came to a Samaritan city called Sichar,
043	JOH	004	005	near the piece of ground which Jacob gave to his son Joseph.
043	JOH	004	006	And Jacob's well was there. Now Jesus was tired with his journey, and sat down at the well: and it was about the sixth hour of the day,
043	JOH	004	007	when a woman of Samaria coming to draw water, Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink.
043	JOH	004	008	(For his disciples were gone away to the city to buy food.)
043	JOH	004	009	But the Samaritan saith unto Him, How is it that thou who art a Jew askest drink of me, who am a Samaritan? for the Jews have no friendly intercourse with the Samaritans.
043	JOH	004	010	Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith unto thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldst have asked of Him, and He would have given thee living water.
043	JOH	004	011	The woman saith unto Him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: whence then hast thou the living water?
043	JOH	004	012	Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank of it himself, and his children, and his cattle?
043	JOH	004	013	Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water, will thirst again;
043	JOH	004	014	but he that drinketh of the water which I shall give him, shall never thirst: but the water, which I shall give him, will be in him a fountain of water springing up unto eternal life.
043	JOH	004	015	The woman saith unto Him, Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst, nor come hither to draw.
043	JOH	004	016	Jesus saith unto her, Go call thine husband, and come hither.
043	JOH	004	017	The woman answered, I have no husband. Jesus saith unto her, Thou hast said right, I have no husband:
043	JOH	004	018	for thou hast had five husbands; and he, whom thou now hast, is not thy husband: this thou hast said true.
043	JOH	004	019	The woman saith unto Him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.
043	JOH	004	020	Our fathers worshipped on this mountain, and ye say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.
043	JOH	004	021	Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the time is coming, when ye shall worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.
043	JOH	004	022	Ye worship ye know not what; but we worship what we know: for salvation is from the Jews.
043	JOH	004	023	But the time is coming, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth: for the Father requireth such worshippers of Him.
043	JOH	004	024	God is a spirit, and they that worship Him, must worship in spirit and truth.
043	JOH	004	025	Then saith the woman unto Him, I know that the Messiah, that is to say the Christ, is coming; and when He comes, He will tell us all things.
043	JOH	004	026	Jesus saith unto her, I, who am talking to thee, am He.
043	JOH	004	027	And upon this came his disciples and wondered that He talked with the woman: (though none of them said, What dost thou seek? or, Why dost thou talk with her?)
043	JOH	004	028	therefore the woman left her water-pot, and went away into the city,
043	JOH	004	029	and saith to the people, Come, see a man who hath told me all that ever I did; is not this the Christ?
043	JOH	004	030	They therefore went out of the city, and came to Him.
043	JOH	004	031	In the mean time his disciples addressed Him, saying, Master, eat.
043	JOH	004	032	But He said unto them, I have food to eat, which ye know not of.
043	JOH	004	033	Therefore the disciples said one to another, Hath any one brought Him aught to eat?
043	JOH	004	034	Jesus saith unto them, My food is to do the will of Him that sent me, and to finish his work.
043	JOH	004	035	Do not ye say, it is yet four months, and then cometh harvest? Behold, lift up your eyes, and see the fields, they are already white for harvest.
043	JOH	004	036	And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth the fruit together unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together;
043	JOH	004	037	for herein the saying is verified, that one soweth, and another reapeth,
043	JOH	004	038	in as much as I have sent you to reap that on which ye have not laboured: others have laboured, and ye are entered into their labors.
043	JOH	004	039	And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on Him, because of what the woman said, testifying, He told me all that ever I did.
043	JOH	004	040	Therefore when the Samaritans came to Him, they desired Him to stay with them: and He staid there two days.
043	JOH	004	041	And many more believed on account of his own discourse:
043	JOH	004	042	and said to the woman, Now we believe, not because of what thou hast spoken; for we ourselves have heard Him, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.
043	JOH	004	043	And after two days he departed thence, and went into Cana of Galilee.
043	JOH	004	044	For Jesus himself had testified that a prophet hath no honor in his own country.
043	JOH	004	045	And when He was come into Galilee, the Galileans received Him, having seen all that he did in Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went to the feast.
043	JOH	004	046	Therefore Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where He had made the water wine.
043	JOH	004	047	And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum: who, when he heard that Jesus was come out of Judea into Galilee, went to Him, and intreated Him, that he would come down and heal his son; for he was at the point of death.
043	JOH	004	048	Jesus therefore said unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders ye will not believe.
043	JOH	004	049	The nobleman saith unto Him, Lord, come down before my child die.
043	JOH	004	050	Jesus saith unto him, Go, thy son is well. And the man believed what Jesus said unto him, and went his way.
043	JOH	004	051	And as he was now going down, his servants met him and told him, saying, Thy son is well.
043	JOH	004	052	He inquired therefore of them the hour in which he grew better: and they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.
043	JOH	004	053	So the father knew that it was in that same hour, in which Jesus said to him, Thy son is well. And he and his whole family believed.
043	JOH	004	054	This is the second miracle that Jesus wrought, upon coming out of Judea into Galilee.
043	JOH	005	001	After these things there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
043	JOH	005	002	Now there is at Jerusalem near the sheep-market a pool, called in Hebrew Bethesda, with five porticos about it.
043	JOH	005	003	In these lay a great number of people that were infirm, blind, lame, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.
043	JOH	005	004	For an angel descended at a certain season into the pool, and moved the water; the first therefore that went in after the disturbing of the water, was cured of whatever malady he laboured under.
043	JOH	005	005	And there was a man who had been under illness thirty eight years.
043	JOH	005	006	Jesus seeing him lie there, and knowing that he had been now a long time ill, saith unto him, Dost thou desire to be cured?
043	JOH	005	007	The infirm man answered Him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is moved, to put me into the pool; but while I am coming, another goes down before me.
043	JOH	005	008	Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.
043	JOH	005	009	And immediately the man was cured: and he took up his bed and walked.
043	JOH	005	010	Now this was the sabbath-day, therefore the Jews said to him that was cured, It is the sabbath, it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed.
043	JOH	005	011	He answered them, He, that made me well, said unto me, Take up thy bed and walk.
043	JOH	005	012	Therefore they asked him, Who is the man that said to thee, Take up thy bed and walk?
043	JOH	005	013	but he, that was healed, did not know who it was: for Jesus had withdrawn himself, there being many people in the place.
043	JOH	005	014	Afterwards Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said to him, Behold, thou art healed; sin no more, least something worse befal thee.
043	JOH	005	015	And the man went away, and told the Jews, that it was Jesus who had healed him.
043	JOH	005	016	And for this did the Jews persecute Jesus, and endeavoured to put Him to death; because He had done these things on the sabbath-day.
043	JOH	005	017	But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh without intermission, and so do I.
043	JOH	005	018	For this therefore the Jews sought the more to kill Him, because He had not only broken the sabbath, but had also called God his own Father, making Himself equal with God.
043	JOH	005	019	Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, Verily, verily I say unto you, the Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He seeth the Father do: for whatsoever He doth, these also the Son doth in like manner.
043	JOH	005	020	For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth Him all things, which He Himself doth: and He will shew Him greater than these, that ye may wonder.
043	JOH	005	021	For as the Father raiseth up the dead and giveth life: even so the Son maketh alive whom He pleaseth.
043	JOH	005	022	For neither doth the Father judge any one, but hath committed all judgement to the Son;
043	JOH	005	023	that all men may honour the Son, even as they honour the Father: he, that honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father that sent Him.
043	JOH	005	024	Verily, verily I say unto you, he, that heareth my word, and believeth in Him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come under condemnation; but is passed from death to life.
043	JOH	005	025	Verily, verily I tell you, that the time is coming, and even now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear shall live.
043	JOH	005	026	For as the Father hath life in Himself, so hath He given also to the Son to have life in Himself.
043	JOH	005	027	And hath given Him authority also to execute judgement, because He is the Son of man.
043	JOH	005	028	Wonder not at this; for the time is coming, in which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,
043	JOH	005	029	and shall come forth, they that have done good to the resurrection of life, and they that have done evil to the resurrection of damnation.
043	JOH	005	030	I can do nothing of my self: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not my own will, but the will of the Father that hath sent me.
043	JOH	005	031	If I alone bear witness of my self, my testimony is not true in law:
043	JOH	005	032	but there is another who testifieth concerning me; and I know that the testimony, which he giveth concerning me, is true.
043	JOH	005	033	Ye your selves sent unto John, and he bore witness to the truth:
043	JOH	005	034	though I need not testimony from man; but I say these things that ye may be saved.
043	JOH	005	035	He was indeed a burning and shining light, and for a while ye willingly rejoiced in his light.
043	JOH	005	036	But I have a testimony greater than John's: for the works which the Father hath given me to perform, the very works which I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.
043	JOH	005	037	And the Father who sent me, hath Himself borne witness of me: and yet ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his form.
043	JOH	005	038	And ye have not his word abiding in you; because ye believe not Him, whom He hath sent.
043	JOH	005	039	Ye search the scriptures; for ye think that in them ye have eternal life:
043	JOH	005	040	and they testify of me: and yet ye will not come to me, that ye may have life.
043	JOH	005	041	Though I desire not applause from men:
043	JOH	005	042	but I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.
043	JOH	005	043	I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not: if another should come in his own name, him ye will receive.
043	JOH	005	044	How can ye believe, who receive applause from each other, and the glory which is from God only, ye seek not?
043	JOH	005	045	Think not that I shall accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye trust.
043	JOH	005	046	For if ye believed Moses, ye would believe me; for he wrote concerning me:
043	JOH	005	047	but if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?
043	JOH	006	001	After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is the sea of Tiberias.
043	JOH	006	002	And a great multitude followed Him, because they saw his miracles which He performed on them that were diseased.
043	JOH	006	003	So Jesus went up to a mountain, and there He sat down with his disciples.
043	JOH	006	004	And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was near.
043	JOH	006	005	Then Jesus lifted up his eyes, and seeing a great multitude come to Him, saith to Philip, Whence shall we buy bread that these people may eat?
043	JOH	006	006	(and this He said to try him, for He knew what He was going to do:)
043	JOH	006	007	Philip answered Him, Two hundred penny-worth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one may take a little.
043	JOH	006	008	One of his disciples, to wit, Andrew the brother of Simon Peter,
043	JOH	006	009	saith unto Him, There is a lad here, that hath five barley loaves, and two small fishes; but what are they among so many?
043	JOH	006	010	And Jesus said, Make the men sit down: (now there was much grass in the place:) so the men sat down in number about five thousand.
043	JOH	006	011	And Jesus took the loaves, and when He had given thanks, He distributed them to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were sat down; and of the fishes likewise, as much as they would take.
043	JOH	006	012	And when they were filled, He saith to his disciples, Gather up the fragments that are left, that nothing may be lost.
043	JOH	006	013	They therefore gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley-loaves, which remained after they had eaten.
043	JOH	006	014	Therefore the people when they had seen the miracle that Jesus wrought, said, this is certainly the Prophet who was to come into the world.
043	JOH	006	015	Jesus therefore knowing that they would come, and take Him by force if possible, to make Him king, retired again to the mountain Himself alone.
043	JOH	006	016	And when evening was come, his disciples went down to the sea:
043	JOH	006	017	and having entered into a ship were going over the Sea towards Capernaum: and it was now dark, and Jesus was not yet come to them.
043	JOH	006	018	And the sea rose high by reason of a violent wind.
043	JOH	006	019	So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and near the ship: and they were affrighted.
043	JOH	006	020	But He saith unto them, It is I: be not afraid.
043	JOH	006	021	They desired therefore to take Him into the ship: and immediately the vessel was at the land to which they were going.
043	JOH	006	022	The day following the people that staid on the other side of the sea, seeing there was no other boat there, but that one into which his disciples embarked, and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat, but that his disciples went away alone:
043	JOH	006	023	though there came other vessels from Tiberias, near the place where they had eaten bread after the Lord had given thanks: when therefore the people saw that Jesus was not there,
043	JOH	006	024	nor his disciples; they also went into those vessels, and came to Capernaum seeking Jesus.
043	JOH	006	025	And when they found Him on the other side of the Sea, they said unto Him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither?
043	JOH	006	026	Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled.
043	JOH	006	027	Labour not so much for the meat that perisheth, but rather for that food which endureth unto life eternal, which the Son of man will give you: for Him hath God the Father sealed.
043	JOH	006	028	Therefore said they unto Him, What should we do, that we may work the works approved of God?
043	JOH	006	029	Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on Him, whom He hath sent.
043	JOH	006	030	Therefore said they unto Him, What sign dost thou shew, that we may see it, and believe Thee? What work dost thou do?
043	JOH	006	031	Our fathers did eat manna in the desert, as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.
043	JOH	006	032	Therefore Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I tell you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven, but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven.
043	JOH	006	033	For the bread of God is that which descendeth from heaven, and giveth life to the world.
043	JOH	006	034	Therefore said they unto Him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.
043	JOH	006	035	Then Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger, and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.
043	JOH	006	036	But I have told you, so that ye have seen me, and yet ye do not believe.
043	JOH	006	037	All that the Father giveth me, will come unto me; and him that cometh to me I will not cast out.
043	JOH	006	038	For I came down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of Him that sent me.
043	JOH	006	039	And this is the will of the Father who sent me, that of all that He hath given me, I should lose none, but should raise them up at the last day.
043	JOH	006	040	And this is the will of Him that sent me, that every one who looketh attentively at the Son, and so believeth on Him, may have eternal life: and I will raise him up at the last day.
043	JOH	006	041	The Jews then murmured about Him; because He said, I am the bread that came down from heaven.
043	JOH	006	042	And they said to one another, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we knew? How then does He say, I came down from heaven?
043	JOH	006	043	Jesus therefore said unto them, Murmur not among yourselves.
043	JOH	006	044	No one can come to me, unless the Father, who hath sent me, draw him, and I will raise him up at the last day.
043	JOH	006	045	It is written in the prophets, "And they shall all be taught of God." Every one therefore that hath heard and learned from the Father, cometh unto me.
043	JOH	006	046	Not that any one hath seen the Father, but He who is from God.
043	JOH	006	047	He hath seen the Father. Verily, verily, I declare unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life.
043	JOH	006	048	I am the bread of life. Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead:
043	JOH	006	049	but this is the bread which cometh down from heaven,
043	JOH	006	050	that any one may eat thereof and not die.
043	JOH	006	051	I am the living bread, which came down from heaven: if any one eat of this bread, he shall live for ever. And the bread, that I will give, is my flesh, which I will give up for the life of the world.
043	JOH	006	052	The Jews therefore cavilled amongst themselves, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat?
043	JOH	006	053	Then said Jesus unto them, I tell you truly, that unless ye eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.
043	JOH	006	054	He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.
043	JOH	006	055	For my flesh is truly food, and my blood is truly drink: he that feedeth on my flesh and drinketh my blood,
043	JOH	006	056	abideth in me and I in him.
043	JOH	006	057	As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father; so he that feedeth on me he also shall live by me.
043	JOH	006	058	This is the bread that came down from heaven: not as your fathers did eat, and yet are dead. He that eateth this bread shall live for ever.
043	JOH	006	059	These things He said in the synagogue, when He was teaching in Capernaum.
043	JOH	006	060	Many therefore of his disciples, when they heard Him, said, This discourse is hard to be understood, who can take it in?
043	JOH	006	061	But Jesus knowing in Himself, that his disciples were murmuring about it, said unto them, Does this offend you?
043	JOH	006	062	What then, if ye should see the Son of man ascending up, where He was before?
043	JOH	006	063	The spirit is the principle of life, the flesh availeth nothing: now the words that I speak unto you are spirit, and therefore life.
043	JOH	006	064	But there are some of you that believe not: (for Jesus knew from the beginning, who they were that believed not, and who would betray Him:
043	JOH	006	065	and He said,) therefore I told you, that no one can come unto me except it be given him from my Father.
043	JOH	006	066	From this time many of his disciples went away, and walked no more with Him.
043	JOH	006	067	Jesus therefore said to the twelve, Have ye also a mind to go away?
043	JOH	006	068	Then Simon Peter answered Him, Lord, to whom shall we go?
043	JOH	006	069	Thou hast the words of eternal life. And we believe and know that thou art the Messiah, the Son of the living God.
043	JOH	006	070	Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?
043	JOH	006	071	Now He spake of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon; for he was about to betray Him, though he was one of the twelve apostles.
043	JOH	007	001	After these things Jesus resided in Galilee: for He would not appear in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill Him.
043	JOH	007	002	Now the Jews feast called the feast of tabernacles was near;
043	JOH	007	003	his brethren therefore said, Depart from hence, and go into Judea, that thy disciples there also may see the works which thou performest.
043	JOH	007	004	For no man doth any thing in secret, who is himself desirous to be known in public. As thou dost these wonderful things, make thyself known to the world.
043	JOH	007	005	For neither did his brethren believe in Him.
043	JOH	007	006	Then saith Jesus unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time is always alike ready; for the world cannot hate you:
043	JOH	007	007	but me it hates, because I bear my testimony concerning it, that it's deeds are evil.
043	JOH	007	008	Go ye up to this feast as soon as ye please; for I am not yet going up to it, because my time is not yet fully come.
043	JOH	007	009	And after He had said these things unto them, He stayed a while in Galilee.
043	JOH	007	010	But when his brethren were gone up, then He also went up to the feast, not in a public manner but as it were in private.
043	JOH	007	011	The Jews therefore sought for Him at the feast, and said, Where is He?
043	JOH	007	012	And there was much murmuring among the people concerning Him: for some said, He is a good man; others said, No: He deceiveth the people.
043	JOH	007	013	No one however spake openly in favor of Him, for fear of the Jews.
043	JOH	007	014	But when it was now about the middle of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple and taught.
043	JOH	007	015	And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, who never learnt?
043	JOH	007	016	Jesus answered them and said, The doctrine that I teach is not mine, but his that sent me.
043	JOH	007	017	If any man desire to do his will, he shall know concerning the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.
043	JOH	007	018	He, that speaketh from himself, seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh the glory of Him that sent him is true, and there is no imposture in him.
043	JOH	007	019	Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you observeth the law? wherefore else do ye seek to kill me?
043	JOH	007	020	The people answered and said, Thou art possessed by a demon: who seeketh to kill thee?
043	JOH	007	021	Jesus answered and said unto them, I performed one miracle on the sabbath, and ye are all amazed at it.
043	JOH	007	022	Now Moses gave you the law of circumcision, (not that it is originally from Moses, but from the patriarchs,) and ye circumcise even on the sabbath:
043	JOH	007	023	if then a man receive circumcision on the sabbath-day, that the law of Moses may not be broken; are ye angry with me, because I made a man perfectly well on the sabbath-day?
043	JOH	007	024	Judge not according to appearance, but judge righteous judgement.
043	JOH	007	025	Therefore some of those of Jerusalem said, Is not this He whom they seek to put to death?
043	JOH	007	026	and here He talketh openly, and they say nothing to Him: Do the rulers indeed know, that this is in truth the Messiah?
043	JOH	007	027	But we know whence this man is; whereas when Christ cometh, no one knoweth whence He is.
043	JOH	007	028	Jesus therefore cried out in the temple, teaching and saying, Ye both know me, ye say, and ye know whence I am: now I am not come of myself, but He that sent me is true, whom ye know not.
043	JOH	007	029	But I know Him, for I am from Him, and He hath sent me.
043	JOH	007	030	They sought therefore to seize Him, but no one laid hand on Him, because his hour was not yet come.
043	JOH	007	031	And many of the people believed on Him, and said, When the Messiah cometh, will He do more miracles than this man hath done?
043	JOH	007	032	Now the pharisees heard the people murmuring these things concerning Him: and they, with the chief priests, sent officers to seize Him.
043	JOH	007	033	Therefore Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while I am to be among you, and then I shall go to Him that sent me.
043	JOH	007	034	Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am to be, ye cannot come.
043	JOH	007	035	Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will He go, that we shall not find Him? will He go to them that are dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?
043	JOH	007	036	What is the meaning of this speech, that He said, "Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am to be, ye cannot come?"
043	JOH	007	037	And on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, If any one thirst, let him come unto me and drink.
043	JOH	007	038	He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, rivers of living water shall flow from within him.
043	JOH	007	039	(This He spake of the Spirit, which they that believe on Him should receive; for the holy Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.)
043	JOH	007	040	Many of the people therefore, when they heard this discourse, said, This is in truth a prophet.
043	JOH	007	041	Others said, This is the Messiah. But some said, Shall the Messiah come out of Galilee?
043	JOH	007	042	Hath not the Scripture said, that Christ cometh of the seed of David, and from Bethlehem, the town whence David was.
043	JOH	007	043	So there was a division among the people about Him.
043	JOH	007	044	And some among them would have seized Him: but no one laid hands on Him.
043	JOH	007	045	Then came the officers to the chief priests and pharisees, and they said, Why have ye not brought Him? and the officers answered,
043	JOH	007	046	Never man spake like this man.
043	JOH	007	047	The pharisees therefore answered them, Are ye also deceived?
043	JOH	007	048	have any of the rulers believed on Him, or of the pharisees?
043	JOH	007	049	but these people, who know not the law, are cursed.
043	JOH	007	050	Upon this Nicodemus, (who came to Him by night)
043	JOH	007	051	being one of them, saith to them, Doth our law judge any man, before it hear him, and know what he hath done?
043	JOH	007	052	They replied, Art thou also of Galilee? Search and see: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.
043	JOH	007	053	And every man went to his own house.
043	JOH	008	001	But Jesus went to the mount of Olives;
043	JOH	008	002	and returned early in the morning into the temple, and all the people came to Him: and He sat down, and taught them.
043	JOH	008	003	And the scribes and pharisees brought to Him a woman taken in adultery;
043	JOH	008	004	and setting her in the midst, they said to Him, "This woman was caught in the very act, committing adultery.
043	JOH	008	005	Now Moses in the law has commanded us that such women should be stoned, but what sayest Thou?"
043	JOH	008	006	This they said to tempt Him, that they might have something to accuse Him of. But Jesus stooping down, wrote with his finger upon the ground.
043	JOH	008	007	And as they continued asking Him, He raised himself up and said unto them, "Let him that is without sin among you, first cast a stone at her."
043	JOH	008	008	Then He stooped down again and wrote on the ground.
043	JOH	008	009	But when they heard his answer, being convicted by their own conscience, they went out one by one, beginning at the elder, even to the last. And Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst of the people.
043	JOH	008	010	Then Jesus rising up, and seeing none but the woman, said unto her, Where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?
043	JOH	008	011	And she said, None, Lord. Then said Jesus unto her, Neither do I condemn thee, Go thy way and sin no more.
043	JOH	008	012	Then spake Jesus again to them, saying, I am the light of the world; he, that followeth me, shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.
043	JOH	008	013	The pharisees therefore said to Him, Thou bearest witness of thyself; thy testimony is not true.
043	JOH	008	014	Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I bear witness of myself, my testimony is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I am going; but ye know not whence I come, nor whither I go.
043	JOH	008	015	Ye judge according to the flesh, but I judge no man as yet:
043	JOH	008	016	though if I should judge, my judgement is true; for I am not alone, but I am with the Father that sent me.
043	JOH	008	017	And it is written in your own law, that the testimony of two persons is valid.
043	JOH	008	018	Now I am one, who bear witness of myself; and the Father, who sent me, beareth witness of me.
043	JOH	008	019	Then said they unto Him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye would have known my Father also.
043	JOH	008	020	These words spake Jesus in the treasury, when He was teaching in the temple: and no one laid hands on Him, for his hour was not yet come.
043	JOH	008	021	Jesus therefore said unto them again, "I am going away, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sin: where I go ye cannot come."
043	JOH	008	022	The Jews therefore said, What! will He kill himself; that He says, where I am going, ye cannot come?
043	JOH	008	023	And He said unto them, Ye are from beneath, I am from above: ye are of this world, I am not of this world.
043	JOH	008	024	Therefore I said unto you, that ye shall die in your sins; for if ye believe not that I am the Messiah, ye shall die in your sins.
043	JOH	008	025	Then said they to Him, Who art thou? And Jesus answered them, Even the same that I told you at first.
043	JOH	008	026	I have many things to say and to judge concerning you: but I only say, He that sent me is true, and I declare to the world those things, which I have heard from Him.
043	JOH	008	027	But they did not know that He spake unto them of the Father.
043	JOH	008	028	Jesus therefore said unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then ye shall know that I am He, and that I do nothing of myself, but as my Father hath instructed me, I speak these things.
043	JOH	008	029	And He that sent me, is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I always do the things that are pleasing to Him.
043	JOH	008	030	As He spake these words many believed on Him.
043	JOH	008	031	Therefore said Jesus to the Jews that believed on Him, If ye continue in my word, ye are indeed my disciples.
043	JOH	008	032	And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.
043	JOH	008	033	They answered Him, We are the seed of Abraham, and never were slaves to any one, how then dost thou say, Ye shall be made free?
043	JOH	008	034	Jesus answered them, Verily, verily I say unto you, whosoever maketh a practice of sin, is the servant of sin.
043	JOH	008	035	Now the servant does not continue always in the family: but the Son abideth always.
043	JOH	008	036	If therefore the Son make you free, ye shall be free indeed.
043	JOH	008	037	I know that ye are the seed of Abraham, but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.
043	JOH	008	038	I speak that which I have seen with my Father, and ye do what ye have seen with your father.
043	JOH	008	039	They answered Him, Abraham is our father, Jesus replied, If ye were the children of Abraham, ye would do the works of Abraham:
043	JOH	008	040	but now ye seek to kill me, who have told you the truth which I have heard from God: Abraham did not thus.
043	JOH	008	041	But ye do the works of your father. Then said they unto Him, We are not born of fornication, we have one Father, even God.
043	JOH	008	042	Jesus said unto them, If God were your father, ye would love me: for I came forth, and do come, from God; neither came I of myself, but He sent me.
043	JOH	008	043	And why do ye not understand my language, but because ye cannot bear my doctrine?
043	JOH	008	044	Ye are of your father the devil, and are bent upon doing the lusts of your father: he was a murderer from the beginning, and continued not in the truth: for there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh like himself, for he is a liar, and the father of such.
043	JOH	008	045	And because I say the truth, ye believe me not. Which of you convicteth me of sin?
043	JOH	008	046	And if I speak truth, why do ye not believe me?
043	JOH	008	047	He, that is of God, receiveth the words of God; but ye therefore receive them not, because ye are not of God.
043	JOH	008	048	The Jews therefore answered and said unto Him. Do we not rightly say, that thou art a Samaritan, and art possessed by a demon?
043	JOH	008	049	Jesus answered I am not possessed by a demon, but I honour my Father, though ye dishonour me.
043	JOH	008	050	And I seek not my own glory; there is One that seeketh it, and judgeth.
043	JOH	008	051	Verily, verily, I say unto you, If any one keep my word, he shall never see death.
043	JOH	008	052	The Jews therefore said unto Him, Now we are sure that thou art possessed by a demon. Abraham is dead, and the prophets too; and thou sayest, If any one keep my word, he shall never taste of death: art thou greater than our father Abraham, who is dead?
043	JOH	008	053	and the prophets are dead: whom dost thou pretend to be?
043	JOH	008	054	Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honor is nothing: it is my Father that glorifieth me, of whom ye say that He is your God.
043	JOH	008	055	And yet ye know him not; but I know Him: and if I should say, That I know Him not, I shall be like you, a liar: but I know Him, and obey his word.
043	JOH	008	056	Your father Abraham longed to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad.
043	JOH	008	057	Then said the Jews unto Him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?
043	JOH	008	058	Jesus said unto them, Before Abraham was, I am.
043	JOH	008	059	Therefore they took up stones to throw at Him. But Jesus concealed Himself, and went out of the temple, through the midst of them, and so passed on.
043	JOH	009	001	And as Jesus was passing along, He saw a man, who had been blind from his birth.
043	JOH	009	002	And his disciples asked Him, saying, Master, who sinned? this man or his parents? that he was born blind.
043	JOH	009	003	Jesus answered, Neither did this man sin, nor his parents: but that the works of God might be manifested in him.
043	JOH	009	004	I must perform the works of Him that sent me, while it is day: the night is coming, when no man can work.
043	JOH	009	005	But as long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.
043	JOH	009	006	And when He had said these things, He spit on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,
043	JOH	009	007	and said to him, Go wash at the pool of Siloam (which signifies Sent.) He went therefore and washed, and came again seeing.
043	JOH	009	008	And the neighbors, and they that had seen him before, that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat begging?
043	JOH	009	009	Some said, this is he: and others, It is like him: but he said, I am the man.
043	JOH	009	010	Therefore they said to him, How were thine eyes opened?
043	JOH	009	011	He answered and said, A man who is called Jesus, made clay and anointed mine eyes, and said to me, Go to the pool of Siloam and wash: and I went and washed and received my sight.
043	JOH	009	012	Then said they unto him, Where is He? he answered, I know not.
043	JOH	009	013	So they brought him, that had formerly been blind, to the pharisees.
043	JOH	009	014	Now it was the sabbath-day, when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.
043	JOH	009	015	Therefore the pharisees also asked him again, how he recovered his sight. And he said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see.
043	JOH	009	016	Then said some of the pharisees, This man is not of God, because He doth not keep the sabbath: but others said, How can a wicked man do such miracles? And there was a division among them.
043	JOH	009	017	So they asked the blind man again, What sayst thou concerning Him? as He hath opened thine eyes.
043	JOH	009	018	And he said, He is a prophet. But the Jews did not believe that he had been blind and recovered sight, till they called the parents of him, that had received his sight.
043	JOH	009	019	And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say, was born blind? how then doth he now see?
043	JOH	009	020	His parents answered them, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind;
043	JOH	009	021	but how it is that he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age, ask him; he can speak for himself.
043	JOH	009	022	These things said his parents, because they were afraid of the Jews; for the Jews had already agreed, that if any one confessed Him to be Christ, he should be turned out of the synagogue.
043	JOH	009	023	Therefore his parents said, he is of age, ask him.
043	JOH	009	024	Then they called a second time for the man that had been blind, and said to him, Give glory to God: for we know that this man is a great sinner.
043	JOH	009	025	He answered, and said, Whether He be a sinner, I know not: but one thing I know, that I who was blind, do now see.
043	JOH	009	026	Then said they to him again, What did he do to thee? how did He open thine eyes?
043	JOH	009	027	He answered them, I have told you already, and ye would not hear? why would ye now hear it again? have ye also a mind to be his disciples?
043	JOH	009	028	Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple, but we are the disciples of Moses: we know that God spake to Moses:
043	JOH	009	029	but as for this man, we know not whence He is.
043	JOH	009	030	The man answered, and said unto them, Why this is something strange, that ye know not whence He is, and yet He hath opened mine eyes.
043	JOH	009	031	Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a servant of God, and do his will, him He heareth.
043	JOH	009	032	From the beginning of the world it was never heard, that any one opened the eyes of a person that was born blind.
043	JOH	009	033	And if this man were not from God, He could do nothing.
043	JOH	009	034	They answered, and said unto him, Thou wast wholly born in sins, and dost thou teach us?
043	JOH	009	035	And they cast him out. Now Jesus heard that they had turned him out of the synagogue; and when He met him, He said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?
043	JOH	009	036	He answered and said, Who is He, Lord, that I may believe on Him?
043	JOH	009	037	Jesus said unto him, Thou hast seen Him, and it is He that talketh with thee.
043	JOH	009	038	And he said, Lord, I believe; and worshipped Him.
043	JOH	009	039	And Jesus said, I am come into this world to execute judgement; that they who see not, may see; and that they who say they see, may be made blind.
043	JOH	009	040	And some of the pharisees who were present, heard these words, and said to Him, Are we blind also?
043	JOH	009	041	Jesus replied, If ye were blind, ye would not have sin: but now ye say, We see; your sin therefore remaineth.
043	JOH	010	001	Verily, verily I say unto you, He that entreth not into the sheep-fold by the door, but climbeth up some other way, is a thief and a robber.
043	JOH	010	002	But he that cometh in by the door, is the shepherd of the sheep.
043	JOH	010	003	To him the porter openeth, and the sheep hear his voice; and He calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.
043	JOH	010	004	And when he bringeth forth his sheep, he goeth before them: and the sheep follow him; because they know his voice.
043	JOH	010	005	But they will not follow a stranger, but will flee from him; because they know not the voice of strangers.
043	JOH	010	006	This parable Jesus spake unto them; but they did not understand what He said to them.
043	JOH	010	007	Jesus therefore said unto them again, Verily, verily I tell you, that I am the door of the sheep.
043	JOH	010	008	All that came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not regard them.
043	JOH	010	009	I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved; and shall go in and out, and find pasture.
043	JOH	010	010	The thief cometh only to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they may have life, and may have it in perfection.
043	JOH	010	011	I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd layeth down his life for the sheep.
043	JOH	010	012	But the hireling, that is not the true shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: and the wolf seizeth them, and disperseth the sheep.
043	JOH	010	013	Now the hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep.
043	JOH	010	014	I am the good shepherd, and I know my own sheep, and am known by them.
043	JOH	010	015	Even as the Father knoweth me, and I know the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep.
043	JOH	010	016	And I have other sheep, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they will hear my voice; so there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.
043	JOH	010	017	For this doth the Father love me; because I lay down my life: that I may take it again.
043	JOH	010	018	None taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself: I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment I have received from my Father.
043	JOH	010	019	There was a division therefore again among the Jews on account of these words.
043	JOH	010	020	And many of them said, He is a demoniac, and is mad; why do ye hear Him?
043	JOH	010	021	Others said, These are not the words of a demoniac; can a demon open the eyes of the blind?
043	JOH	010	022	Now it was the feast of dedication at Jerusalem, and it was winter.
043	JOH	010	023	And Jesus was walking about the temple, in Solomon's portico.
043	JOH	010	024	Then the Jews came round Him, and said unto Him, How long dost thou hold us in suspense? If thou be the Messiah, tell us plainly.
043	JOH	010	025	Jesus answered them, I have told you, and ye do not believe me: though the works that I do in the name of my Father, testify of me.
043	JOH	010	026	But ye believe not; because ye are not of my sheep: for as I said unto you, my sheep hear my voice,
043	JOH	010	027	and I know them, and they follow me.
043	JOH	010	028	And I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; nor shall any one force them out of my hand.
043	JOH	010	029	My Father who gave them to me, is greater than all: and therefore none is able to force them out of my Father's hand.
043	JOH	010	030	I and the Father are one. Then the Jews again took up stones to stone Him.
043	JOH	010	031	But Jesus said unto them,
043	JOH	010	032	Many good works have I shewn you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?
043	JOH	010	033	The Jews answered Him, saying, We do not go about to stone thee for a good work, but for blasphemy; and because thou being a man makest thyself God.
043	JOH	010	034	Jesus replied, Is it not written in your law, "I have said, ye are gods?"
043	JOH	010	035	And if it stiled them gods, to whom the word of God came, (and the scripture cannot be made void,)
043	JOH	010	036	do ye say of Him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, thou blasphemest, because I said, I am the Son of God?
043	JOH	010	037	If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.
043	JOH	010	038	But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in Him.
043	JOH	010	039	Therefore they sought again to seize Him; but He escaped out of their hand, and went away again beyond Jordan,
043	JOH	010	040	to the place where John was at first baptizing, and there He abode.
043	JOH	010	041	And many resorted to Him, and said, John wrought no miracle, but all that he said concerning this man, was true.
043	JOH	010	042	And many there believed on Him.
043	JOH	011	001	Now there was a certain person sick, to wit, Lazarus of Bethany, the town of Mary and Martha her sister.
043	JOH	011	002	(And it was Mary, that anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.)
043	JOH	011	003	His sisters therefore sent to Him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.
043	JOH	011	004	But when Jesus heard it, He said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified thereby.
043	JOH	011	005	Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.
043	JOH	011	006	Therefore when He heard that Lazarus was sick, He stayed indeed two days in the place where He was:
043	JOH	011	007	and after that He saith to his disciples, Let us go again into Judea.
043	JOH	011	008	The disciples say unto Him, Master, the Jews very lately attempted to stone thee, and art thou going thither again?
043	JOH	011	009	Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? if any man walk in the day, he doth not stumble; for he seeth the light of this world:
043	JOH	011	010	but if any one walk in the night, he stumbleth; because he hath no light.
043	JOH	011	011	Having thus answered them, He afterwards saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus is asleep; but I am going to awake him.
043	JOH	011	012	Therefore his disciples said, Lord, if he sleep, he will do well.
043	JOH	011	013	But Jesus spake of his death; though they thought that He was speaking of the refreshment of sleep.
043	JOH	011	014	Then Jesus said to them plainly, Lazarus is dead:
043	JOH	011	015	and I am glad for your sakes, I was not there, that ye may believe: but let us go to him.
043	JOH	011	016	Thomas therefore, who is called Didymus, said to his fellow-disciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.
043	JOH	011	017	And when Jesus came, He found that he had been four days in the grave.
043	JOH	011	018	Now Bethany was near to Jerusalem, being but about fifteen furlongs from it:
043	JOH	011	019	and many of the Jews were come to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.
043	JOH	011	020	Therefore Martha, when she heard that Jesus was coming, went to meet Him: but Mary was sitting in the house.
043	JOH	011	021	And Martha said unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.
043	JOH	011	022	But I know that even now whatsoever thou shalt ask of God, God will grant it thee.
043	JOH	011	023	Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.
043	JOH	011	024	Martha saith unto Him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.
043	JOH	011	025	Jesus then told her, I am the resurrection and the life: he that believeth on me, though he were dead, shall live again.
043	JOH	011	026	And every one that is alive, and believeth in me, shall never die.
043	JOH	011	027	Dost thou believe this? She saith unto Him, Yes, Lord, I believe that thou art the Messiah, the Son of God, who was to come into the world.
043	JOH	011	028	And when she had said this, she went away, and called Mary her sister, telling her privately, The Master is coming and calleth for thee.
043	JOH	011	029	As soon as she heard it, she gets up with all speed and comes to Him.
043	JOH	011	030	For Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in the place where Martha met Him.
043	JOH	011	031	The Jews therefore that were with her in the house to comfort her, seeing Mary that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She is going to the grave to weep there.
043	JOH	011	032	Then Mary, when she came where Jesus was and saw Him, fell down at his feet, saying unto Him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.
043	JOH	011	033	Jesus therefore, when He saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping, that came with her, groaned in spirit and was troubled.
043	JOH	011	034	And He said, Where have ye laid him?
043	JOH	011	035	They say unto Him, Lord, come and see: and Jesus wept.
043	JOH	011	036	The Jews therefore said, Behold, how he loved him!
043	JOH	011	037	but some of them said, Could not He, who opened the eyes of the blind, have caused also that this man should not have died?
043	JOH	011	038	Jesus therefore, again groaning in himself, cometh to the sepulchre: which was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.
043	JOH	011	039	Jesus saith, Take away the stone. Martha, the sister of the deceased, saith unto Him, Lord, by this time he is offensive; for it is the fourth day.
043	JOH	011	040	Jesus saith unto her, Did I not tell thee, that if thou believest, thou shalt see the glory of God?
043	JOH	011	041	So they took away the stone from the place where the corpse was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes and said, Father, I thank Thee, that Thou hast heard me.
043	JOH	011	042	I knew indeed that Thou always hearest me: but because of the people standing by I say this, that they may believe that Thou hast sent me.
043	JOH	011	043	And when He had said these things, He cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.
043	JOH	011	044	And he that had been dead came forth, having his feet and hands rolled up in grave-cloths: and his face bound about with a napkin. Then Jesus bid them, Loosen him and let him go.
043	JOH	011	045	Therefore many of the Jews, that came to Mary and saw what Jesus did, believed on Him.
043	JOH	011	046	But some of them went to the pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.
043	JOH	011	047	Therefore the chief priests and the pharisees held a council and said, What are we doing? for this man worketh many miracles.
043	JOH	011	048	If we suffer Him to go on thus, all the people will believe on Him, and the Romans will come and destroy both our place and nation.
043	JOH	011	049	But Caiaphas who was one of them, being high-priest that year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all;
043	JOH	011	050	nor do ye consider, that it is better for us that one man should die for the people, than that the whole nation should perish.
043	JOH	011	051	This however he spake not of himself, but being high-priest at that time he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation:
043	JOH	011	052	and not for the Jewish nation only, but that he might also gather together the children of God that are dispersed.
043	JOH	011	053	From that day therefore they consulted together to put Him to death.
043	JOH	011	054	Wherefore Jesus appeared no longer publicly among the Jews; but went away from thence into the country near the wilderness, to a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples.
043	JOH	011	055	Now the passover of the Jews was near; and many went up to Jerusalem out of the country, before the passover, to purify themselves.
043	JOH	011	056	So they sought for Jesus, and said to one another in the temple, What think ye? that He will not come to the feast?
043	JOH	011	057	Now both the chief priests and the pharisees had given order, that if any one knew where He was, he should inform them, that they might take Him.
043	JOH	012	001	Jesus however, six days before the passover, came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, who had been dead, and whom He raised from the dead.
043	JOH	012	002	Therefore they made Him a supper there, and Martha waited at table, but Lazarus was one of them that sat down with Him.
043	JOH	012	003	And Mary taking a pound of ointment of spikenard of great value, anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped them with her hair; and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.
043	JOH	012	004	Therefore said one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, who was about to betray Him,
043	JOH	012	005	Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence and given to the poor?
043	JOH	012	006	He said this, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and having the common purse he carried what was put into it.
043	JOH	012	007	Jesus therefore said, Let her alone, she hath reserved this as for the day of my burial.
043	JOH	012	008	For the poor ye have always with you, but me ye have not always.
043	JOH	012	009	And a great number of the Jews understanding that He was there, came not only on account of Jesus, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom He had raised from the dead.
043	JOH	012	010	Wherefore the chief priests took counsel to put Lazarus also to death.
043	JOH	012	011	Because on his account many of the Jews went away from them, and believed on Jesus.
043	JOH	012	012	The next day a great multitude that were come to the feast, hearing that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, took branches of palm-trees,
043	JOH	012	013	and went out to meet Him, and cried, Hosanna! blessed be the king of Israel, who cometh in the name of the Lord.
043	JOH	012	014	And Jesus having gotten a young ass sat thereon,
043	JOH	012	015	as it is written, "Fear not, O daughter of Sion, behold thy king cometh sitting on an ass's colt."
043	JOH	012	016	Now his disciples did not understand these things at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written concerning Him, and that they had done thus unto Him.
043	JOH	012	017	And the people that were with Him testified, that He called Lazarus out of the grave, and raised him from the dead:
043	JOH	012	018	and for this reason the people went to meet Him, because they heard that He had done this miracle.
043	JOH	012	019	The pharisees therefore said among themselves, Do ye not see that ye prevail nothing? Behold, all the world is gone after Him.
043	JOH	012	020	And among those that came up to worship at the feast there were certain Greeks:
043	JOH	012	021	that came to Philip who was of Bethsaida in Galilee, and asked him, saying, Sir, we have a desire to see Jesus.
043	JOH	012	022	And Philip cometh and telleth Andrew, and then Andrew and Philip told Jesus.
043	JOH	012	023	And Jesus answered them saying, The time is come that the Son of man is to be glorified.
043	JOH	012	024	Though I tell you indeed and in truth, Except a grain of wheat fall into the ground and die, it remaineth alone; but if it die, it produceth much fruit.
043	JOH	012	025	So he, that loveth his life, shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world, shall preserve it unto life eternal.
043	JOH	012	026	If any man would serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: and if any one serve me, him will my Father honour.
043	JOH	012	027	Now is my soul troubled, and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I to this hour.
043	JOH	012	028	Father, glorify thy name. Then came a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.
043	JOH	012	029	The people therefore that stood by, and heard it, said, That it was thunder: but others said, it was an angel spake to Him.
043	JOH	012	030	Jesus answered and said, This voice came not for my sake, but for yours.
043	JOH	012	031	Now is the judgement of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.
043	JOH	012	032	And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, shall draw all men unto me.
043	JOH	012	033	This He said, signifying what death He should die.
043	JOH	012	034	The people answered Him, We have heard out of the law, that the Messiah abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, the Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?
043	JOH	012	035	Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while the light is to be with you; walk while ye have the light, least darkness overtake you; for he that walketh in the dark knoweth not whither he goeth.
043	JOH	012	036	While ye have the light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light. These things spake Jesus, and then went away, and concealed himself from them.
043	JOH	012	037	But though He had done so many miracles before their eyes, yet they did not believe on Him:
043	JOH	012	038	so that the word of Esaias the prophet was fulfilled, which he spake, saying, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?
043	JOH	012	039	And therefore they could not believe; for Esaias had also said,
043	JOH	012	040	He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart, that they might not see with their eyes, and understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.
043	JOH	012	041	These things said Esaias when he saw his glory, and spake concerning Him.
043	JOH	012	042	There were however many of the chief rulers that believed on Him; but because of the pharisees they did not confess it, lest they should be excommunicated.
043	JOH	012	043	For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.
043	JOH	012	044	And Jesus raised his voice, and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me only, but on Him that sent me:
043	JOH	012	045	and he that beholdeth me, beholdeth Him that sent me.
043	JOH	012	046	I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me, might not abide in darkness.
043	JOH	012	047	And if any one hear my words and believe not, I do not condemn him: for I am not now come to condemn the world, but to save the world.
043	JOH	012	048	He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word, that I have spoken, will condemn him at the last day.
043	JOH	012	049	For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father, who sent me, gave me a commandment, what I should say and what I should speak.
043	JOH	012	050	And I know that his commandment is life eternal: the things therefore which I speak, I so speak, as the Father hath directed me.
043	JOH	013	001	Now before the feast of the passover, (Jesus knowing that his hour was come, when He should pass out of this world unto the Father, as He had loved his own, who were yet in the world, He loved them unto the end:)
043	JOH	013	002	supper being prepared, (the devil having put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, to betray Him) Jesus,
043	JOH	013	003	who knew that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that He came from God, and was going to God,
043	JOH	013	004	riseth from supper, and turneth aside his clothes, and took a towel and tied it about Him;
043	JOH	013	005	and then pouring water into a bason, began to wash the feet of his disciples, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith He was girded.
043	JOH	013	006	He cometh therefore to Simon Peter among the rest, who saith unto Him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet?
043	JOH	013	007	Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou dost not now understand, but thou shalt know hereafter.
043	JOH	013	008	Peter saith to Him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I do not wash thee, thou hast no part with me.
043	JOH	013	009	Simon Peter saith unto Him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.
043	JOH	013	010	Jesus saith to him, He that hath been bathing, hath need only to wash his feet, being then clean all over: and thus ye are clean, but not all of you.
043	JOH	013	011	For He knew who would betray Him; therefore He said, Ye are not all clean.
043	JOH	013	012	And when He had washed their feet, and taken his clothes about Him, He sat down again, and said to them, Do ye know the intent of what I have been doing to you?
043	JOH	013	013	Ye call me, Master, and Lord; and ye say well; for so I am.
043	JOH	013	014	If I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet, ye also ought to wash one another's feet.
043	JOH	013	015	For I have given you an example, that ye also should do as I have done to you.
043	JOH	013	016	Verily, verily I say unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord, nor is the messenger greater than he that sent him.
043	JOH	013	017	If ye know these things, happy are ye, if ye do them.
043	JOH	013	018	I speak not of you all; I know whom I have chosen: but have done it that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me, hath lift up his heel against me.
043	JOH	013	019	And I tell you now, before it come, that when it comes to pass ye may believe that I am the Messiah.
043	JOH	013	020	Verily, verily I say unto you, He that receiveth him, whom I shall send, receiveth me: and he that receiveth me, receiveth Him that sent me.
043	JOH	013	021	Jesus having said these things was troubled in spirit, and He openly testified and said, Verily, verily I tell you, that one of you will betray me.
043	JOH	013	022	The disciples therefore looked on one another, doubting of whom He spake.
043	JOH	013	023	Now there was one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved, sitting next Him.
043	JOH	013	024	Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him to ask, who it was concerning whom He spake.
043	JOH	013	025	And he, reclining on the breast of Jesus, saith unto Him, Lord, who is it?
043	JOH	013	026	Jesus answered, It is he to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped it: and He dipped in a sop and gave it to Judas the Iscariot the son of Simon.
043	JOH	013	027	And after the sop Satan entred into him. Then Jesus saith unto him, What thou dost, do quickly.
043	JOH	013	028	But none of those that sat at table knew wherefore He said this to him.
043	JOH	013	029	For some of them thought, because Judas kept the purse, that Jesus said to him, Buy what things we have need of against the feast: or that he should give something to the poor.
043	JOH	013	030	He therefore, when he had taken the sop, immediately went out. And it was night.
043	JOH	013	031	And when he was gone out Jesus said, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in Him:
043	JOH	013	032	and if God be glorified in Him, God will glorify Him in Himself, and will soon glorify Him.
043	JOH	013	033	Little children, I am to be with you but a little while longer. Ye will wish for me, and as I said to the Jews, "Whither I go ye cannot come", so I now tell you.
043	JOH	013	034	A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; ---as I have loved you, that ye also love one another: for by this shall all men know that ye are my disciples,
043	JOH	013	035	if ye have mutual love to each other.
043	JOH	013	036	Simon Peter saith unto Him, Lord, whither art thou going? Jesus answered him, Whither I am going thou canst not follow me now, but thou shalt follow me hereafter.
043	JOH	013	037	Peter saith unto Him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thee.
043	JOH	013	038	Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake? Verily verily I tell thee, The cock shall not crow till thou hast denied me thrice.
043	JOH	014	001	Let not your heart be troubled: believe in God, believe also in me.
043	JOH	014	002	In my Father's house there are many mansions; if not, I would have told you. I am going to prepare a place for you.
043	JOH	014	003	And as I go to prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you to myself, that where I am, ye may also be.
043	JOH	014	004	And ye know where I am going, and ye know the way.
043	JOH	014	005	Thomas saith unto Him, Lord, we know not whither thou art going, and how can we know the way?
043	JOH	014	006	Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, and the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father but by me.
043	JOH	014	007	If ye had known me, ye would have known my Father also: and from henceforth ye do know Him, and may be said to have seen Him.
043	JOH	014	008	Philip saith unto Him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us.
043	JOH	014	009	Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long with you, and dost thou not know me? Philip, he that hath seen me, hath seen the Father: and how then dost thou say, Shew us the Father?
043	JOH	014	010	Dost thou not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? as to the words which I speak to you, I speak them not of my self; and the Father who abideth in me, doth the works.
043	JOH	014	011	Believe me therefore that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: at lest, believe me for the very works.
043	JOH	014	012	Verily, verily I say unto you, he that believeth on me, the works that I perform he also shall perform, and greater than these shall he do: because I am going to the Father.
043	JOH	014	013	And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, I will do it: that the Father may be glorified in the Son.
043	JOH	014	014	If ye ask any thing in my name, I will do it.
043	JOH	014	015	If ye love me, keep my commandments. And I will ask the Father,
043	JOH	014	016	and He will give you another comforter to abide with you for ever:
043	JOH	014	017	even the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth Him not, neither knoweth Him: but ye know Him, because He abideth with you, and shall be in you.
043	JOH	014	018	I will not leave you orphans: I will come to you.
043	JOH	014	019	Yet a little while, and the world shall see me no more; but ye shall see me: and because I live, ye shall live also.
043	JOH	014	020	Then ye shall know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you.
043	JOH	014	021	He that hath my commandments and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest my self to him.
043	JOH	014	022	Judas (not the Iscariot) saith unto Him, Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thy self to us, and not to the world?
043	JOH	014	023	Jesus answered and said unto him, If any one love me, he will observe my word: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and will make our abode with him.
043	JOH	014	024	He that doth not love me, doth not observe my words: and yet the word that ye hear, is not mine, but the Father's who hath sent me.
043	JOH	014	025	These things have I spoken unto you, while I have been with you.
043	JOH	014	026	But the comforter, that is the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all that I have said unto you.
043	JOH	014	027	Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you; not as the world giveth, do I give unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.
043	JOH	014	028	Ye have heard, how I said unto you, "I am going away, and I shall come again to you." If ye loved me, ye would rejoice that I said, I am going to the Father: for my Father is greater than I.
043	JOH	014	029	And now I have told you before it come to pass, that when it cometh to pass ye may believe.
043	JOH	014	030	I shall not have much more conversation with you: for the prince of this world is coming; not that he hath any thing in me,
043	JOH	014	031	but that the world may know that I love the Father, and that I do as the Father hath commanded me. Arise, let us go hence.
043	JOH	015	001	I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman:
043	JOH	015	002	every branch in me that beareth not fruit He taketh away, and every one that beareth fruit, He purgeth, that it may bear more fruit.
043	JOH	015	003	Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.
043	JOH	015	004	Abide therefore in me, and I will abide in you: for as the branch cannot bear fruit of it self, unless it abide in the vine; so neither can ye, except ye abide in me.
043	JOH	015	005	I am the vine, ye are the branches; he that abideth in me, and I in him, beareth much fruit: but without me ye can do nothing.
043	JOH	015	006	If any one abide not in me, he is cast out as a useless branch and withereth: and they gather them up, and throw them into the fire, and they are burnt.
043	JOH	015	007	If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask what ye will, and it shall be granted you.
043	JOH	015	008	Herein is my father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; and so shall ye be my disciples.
043	JOH	015	009	As the Father hath loved me, and I have loved you, continue in my love:
043	JOH	015	010	and if ye keep my commandments ye will continue in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and continue in his love.
043	JOH	015	011	These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy in you may continue, and that your joy may be full.
043	JOH	015	012	This is my commandment, that ye love one another, as I have loved you.
043	JOH	015	013	Greater love hath no one than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends:
043	JOH	015	014	and ye are my friends, if ye do what I command you.
043	JOH	015	015	I no longer stile you servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doth: but I have called you friends; for whatsoever I have heard from my Father, I have made known to you.
043	JOH	015	016	Ye did not first choose me, but I chose you, and have appointed you to go forth, and bear fruit, and that your fruit should be lasting: that whatsoever ye ask the Father in my name, He may give it you.
043	JOH	015	017	These commands I give you, that ye should love one another.
043	JOH	015	018	If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me first.
043	JOH	015	019	If ye were of the world, the world would love its own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.
043	JOH	015	020	Remember what I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you: if they have observed my word, they will also observe yours.
043	JOH	015	021	But all these things will they do unto you, on my account, because they know not Him that sent me.
043	JOH	015	022	If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now they have no excuse for their sin.
043	JOH	015	023	He that hateth me, hateth my Father also.
043	JOH	015	024	If I had not done among them such works as no other ever did, they had not comparatively had sin: but now they have both seen, and hated, both me and my Father.
043	JOH	015	025	But thus it is that the word might be fulfilled, which is written in their law, they hated me without a cause.
043	JOH	015	026	But when the comforter is come, whom I will send to you from the Father, (even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father,) He shall testify of me.
043	JOH	015	027	And ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning.
043	JOH	016	001	These things have I spoken unto you, that ye may not be offended:
043	JOH	016	002	for they will excommunicate you: yea, the time is coming, that whosoever killeth you, will think that he offers an acceptable service to God.
043	JOH	016	003	And these things will they do unto you; because they have not known the Father, nor me.
043	JOH	016	004	But I have told you these things, that when the time cometh, ye may remember that I told you of them. Though I did not tell you of them at the beginning, because I was with you.
043	JOH	016	005	But now I am going away to Him that sent me, and yet none of you asketh me, Whither art thou going? but because I have said these things to you,
043	JOH	016	006	sorrow hath filled your heart.
043	JOH	016	007	Nevertheless I tell you the truth, it is expedient for you that I should go away; for if I go not away, the comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send Him unto you.
043	JOH	016	008	And when He comes, He will convince the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgement:
043	JOH	016	009	of sin, because they believe not on me;
043	JOH	016	010	of righteousness, because I am going to my Father and ye shall see me no more;
043	JOH	016	011	and of judgement, because the prince of this world is judged.
043	JOH	016	012	I have yet many things to say to you, but ye cannot bear them now.
043	JOH	016	013	But when the Spirit of truth is come, He will guide you into all truth: for He will not speak of Himself; but whatsoever He shall hear, that will He speak, and will shew you things to come.
043	JOH	016	014	He shall glorify me, for He shall take of mine and shew it unto you.
043	JOH	016	015	All that the Father hath are mine: therefore I said, that He shall take of mine and shew it unto you.
043	JOH	016	016	A little while and ye shall not see me: and again a little while and ye shall see me, because I am going to the Father.
043	JOH	016	017	Some of his disciples therefore said one to another, What is the meaning of this that He saith to us, A little while and ye shall not see me, and again a little while and ye shall see me, and---because I am going to the Father?
043	JOH	016	018	they said therefore, What is this little while that He speaks of? we do not understand what He means.
043	JOH	016	019	Now Jesus knew that they wanted to ask Him, and therefore said unto them, Are ye enquiring among each other about this, that I said, A little while and ye shall not see me, and again a little while and ye shall see me?
043	JOH	016	020	Verily I tell you, that ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: and ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.
043	JOH	016	021	A woman when she is in labor, hath sorrow, because her hour is come; but when she is delivered of the child, she thinks no more of the anguish, for joy, that a man is born into the world.
043	JOH	016	022	And ye therefore now have sorrow; but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy shall no one take from you.
043	JOH	016	023	And in that day ye shall ask me nothing: but I assure you, that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, He will give it you.
043	JOH	016	024	Hitherto ye have asked for nothing in my name: ask and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.
043	JOH	016	025	These things have I spoken to you in parables: but the time is coming when I shall no more speak to you in parables, but tell you with plainness concerning the Father.
043	JOH	016	026	In that day ye shall ask in my name; and I do not say that I will ask the Father on your behalf.
043	JOH	016	027	For the Father himself loveth you; because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came from God: and I indeed came from the Father,
043	JOH	016	028	and am come into the world: but now I am leaving the world again, and am going to the Father.
043	JOH	016	029	His disciples said unto Him, Now indeed Thou speakest plainly, and usest no parable.
043	JOH	016	030	Now we are convinced that Thou knowest all things, and hast no need that any one should ask Thee: by this we believe that Thou camest forth from God.
043	JOH	016	031	Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe?
043	JOH	016	032	Behold, the time is coming, and is even now come, that ye shall be dispersed every one his own way, and shall leave me alone: but I am not alone, for the Father is with me.
043	JOH	016	033	These things have I spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have trouble: but be of good courage, I have overcome the world.
043	JOH	017	001	When Jesus had spoken these words, He lifted up his eyes to heaven and said, ---"Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify Thee:
043	JOH	017	002	as Thou hast given Him power over all flesh, that as to all which Thou hast given Him, He might give them eternal life;
043	JOH	017	003	and this is life eternal, to know Thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent.
043	JOH	017	004	I have glorified Thee on earth, I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do:
043	JOH	017	005	and now, O Father, glorify Thou me with thine own self, with the glory which I had with Thee before the world was made.
043	JOH	017	006	I have manifested thy name to the men, whom Thou gavest me out of the world: thine they were, and Thou gavest them to me, and they have kept thy word.
043	JOH	017	007	They now know that all things whatsoever Thou hast given me, are indeed from Thee;
043	JOH	017	008	for the instructions, which Thou gavest me, I have given to them: and they have received them, and have known of a truth that I came from Thee, and have believed that thou hast sent me.
043	JOH	017	009	I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for those whom Thou hast given me, for they are thine.
043	JOH	017	010	And all my concerns are thine, and thine are mine: and I am therefore glorified in them.
043	JOH	017	011	And as I am to be no longer in the world, but these are in the world, and I am coming to Thee, Holy Father, keep by thy name those whom Thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are.
043	JOH	017	012	While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name; I have preserved those whom Thou gavest me, and none of them is lost; except the son of perdition, that the scripture might be fulfilled.
043	JOH	017	013	But now I am coming to Thee, and I speak these things in the world, that they may have my joy fulfilled in them.
043	JOH	017	014	I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.
043	JOH	017	015	I do not pray that Thou wouldest take them out of the world, but that thou wouldest keep them from the evil.
043	JOH	017	016	They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.
043	JOH	017	017	Sanctify them by thy truth: thy word is truth.
043	JOH	017	018	As Thou hast sent me into the world, so have I also sent them into the world.
043	JOH	017	019	And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also may be sanctified through the truth.
043	JOH	017	020	Nor do I pray for these only, but for them also that shall believe on me through their word.
043	JOH	017	021	That they all may be one, as Thou, O Father, art in me, and I in Thee; that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.
043	JOH	017	022	And the glory which thou gavest me, I have given them: that they may be one, even as we are one.
043	JOH	017	023	I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that Thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as Thou hast loved me.
043	JOH	017	024	Father, I desire that they also, whom thou hast given me, may be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for Thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.
043	JOH	017	025	O righteous Father, the world indeed hath not known Thee: but I have known Thee, and these have known that Thou hast sent me.
043	JOH	017	026	And I have made known to them thy name, and will farther make it known; that the love wherewith Thou hast loved me, may be in them, and I also in them.
043	JOH	018	001	When Jesus had spoken these words, He went out with his disciples over the brook Kedron; where there was a garden, into which He entred, and his disciples. Now Judas who was gone to betray Him,
043	JOH	018	002	knew the place: for Jesus often met there together with his disciples: Judas therefore having got a band of soldiers,
043	JOH	018	003	and officers from the chief priests and pharisees, cometh thither with candles, and lamps, and arms.
043	JOH	018	004	Upon which Jesus, who knew all that was coming upon Him, went forth and said unto them, Whom do ye seek? They answered Him, Jesus the Nazarene.
043	JOH	018	005	Jesus saith unto them, I am He. And Judas that betrayed Him, was standing with them.
043	JOH	018	006	Now as soon as He said unto them, I am He, they went backwards and fell to the ground.
043	JOH	018	007	Then He asked them again, Whom do ye seek?
043	JOH	018	008	And they said, Jesus the Nazarene. Jesus answered, I have told you that I am He: if therefore ye seek me, let these go their way:
043	JOH	018	009	That the word might be fulfilled which He had spoken, "Of those, whom Thou hast given me, I have lost none."
043	JOH	018	010	Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it, and smote the high priest's servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus.
043	JOH	018	011	But Jesus said to Peter, Put up thy sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?
043	JOH	018	012	So the band with the captain, and the officers of the Jews seized Jesus, and bound Him:
043	JOH	018	013	and led Him away to Annas first: (for he was father-in-law to Caiaphas, who was high-priest that year:)
043	JOH	018	014	and Annas sent Him bound to Caiaphas the high-priest. Now Caiaphas was he who had said in council to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.
043	JOH	018	015	And Simon Peter and another disciple followed Jesus. And that other disciple being known to the high priest went in with Jesus into the high-priest's hall.
043	JOH	018	016	But Peter stood at the door without: the other disciple therefore, who was known to the high-priest, went out and spake to her that kept the door, and brought Peter in.
043	JOH	018	017	Then saith the maid, that kept the door, to Peter, Art not thou also one of this man's disciples? and he said, I am not.
043	JOH	018	018	And the servants and officers stood there, having made a fire of coals, for it was cold, and were warming themselves: and Peter was standing with them and warming himself.
043	JOH	018	019	The high-priest therefore asked Jesus concerning his disciples, and his doctrine.
043	JOH	018	020	Jesus answered him, I spake openly to the world, I always taught in the synagogue and in the temple, whither the Jews are continually resorting: and in secret have said nothing. Why dost thou ask me?
043	JOH	018	021	ask them that heard me, what I have said unto them: for they know what I have said.
043	JOH	018	022	And upon his saying these things, one of the officers that stood by struck Jesus, saying, Dost thou answer the high-priest thus?
043	JOH	018	023	Jesus answered him, If I have ever spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why dost thou strike me?
043	JOH	018	024	[See verse 24 between verse 13 and 14.]
043	JOH	018	025	And Simon Peter stood warming himself: and they said to him, Art not thou one of his disciples? and he denied it, and said, I am not.
043	JOH	018	026	Then said one of the servants of the high-priest, kinsman to him whose ear Peter cut off, Did not I see thee in the garden with Him?
043	JOH	018	027	Peter then denied it again, and immediately the cock crew.
043	JOH	018	028	Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas to the pretorium: (now it was morning) and they themselves went not in to the court, least they should be defiled, and so might not eat of the passover.
043	JOH	018	029	Therefore Pilate went out to them, and said, What accusation do ye bring against this man?
043	JOH	018	030	They answered him, If He were not a malefactor, we should not have delivered Him to thee.
043	JOH	018	031	Then said Pilate to them, Take Him, and judge Him according to your law. But the Jews said to him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:
043	JOH	018	032	that what Jesus had said might be fulfilled, signifying by what death He should die.
043	JOH	018	033	Pilate therefore went into the palace again, and called Jesus and said to Him, Art thou the king of the Jews?
043	JOH	018	034	Jesus answered him, Dost thou say this from thyself, or did others tell it thee of me?
043	JOH	018	035	Pilate replied, Am I a Jew? thine own nation, and the chief priests, have delivered thee to me: what hast thou done?
043	JOH	018	036	Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, my servants would have fought, that I might not have been delivered to the Jews: but my kingdom is not from hence.
043	JOH	018	037	Pilate therefore said unto Him, Art thou then a king? Jesus answered, Thou sayest right, I am a king. For this end was I born, and for this came I into the world, even that I might bear witness to the truth. Every one that is of the truth, heareth my voice.
043	JOH	018	038	Pilate saith unto Him, What is truth? And as soon as he had spoke, he went out again to the Jews,
043	JOH	018	039	and saith unto them, I find no fault at all in Him. But ye have a custom, that I should release to you one at the passover; will ye therefore that I release to you the king of the Jews?
043	JOH	018	040	Then they all cried out again, saying, Not Him, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.
043	JOH	019	001	Then Pilate therefore took Jesus and scourged Him.
043	JOH	019	002	And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head,
043	JOH	019	003	and threw a purple robe about Him, and said, "Hail king of the Jews," and struck Him with their hands.
043	JOH	019	004	Pilate therefore came out again, and saith unto them, Behold I bring Him out to you, that ye may know that I find no fault in Him.
043	JOH	019	005	So Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. And Pilate saith unto them, "Behold the man."
043	JOH	019	006	When the chief priests therefore and the officers saw Him, they cried out, saying, "Crucify Him, crucify Him." Pilate saith unto them, Take Him yourselves, and crucify Him: for I find no fault in Him.
043	JOH	019	007	The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law He ought to die, because He made himself the Son of God.
043	JOH	019	008	Now when Pilate heard this he was the more afraid;
043	JOH	019	009	and went into the palace again, and saith to Jesus, From whence art thou? but Jesus gave him no answer.
043	JOH	019	010	Pilate therefore saith unto Him, Dost thou not speak to me? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release thee?
043	JOH	019	011	Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above; wherefore he, that delivered me up to thee, hath the greater sin.
043	JOH	019	012	Upon this Pilate sought to release Him; but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou release this man, thou art not Cesar's friend; for whosoever maketh himself a king, opposeth Cesar.
043	JOH	019	013	Therefore when Pilate heard this he brought Jesus forth, and sat down on the tribunal, in a place called the Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha.
043	JOH	019	014	(And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour.) And he saith to the Jews, Behold your king. But they cried out,
043	JOH	019	015	Away with Him, away with Him, crucify Him. Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your king? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Cesar.
043	JOH	019	016	Then delivered he Him therefore unto them to be crucified.
043	JOH	019	017	And they took Jesus, and led Him away. And He went out, bearing his cross, into a place called the place of a scull, in Hebrew Golgotha:
043	JOH	019	018	where they crucified Him, and with Him two others, one on each side, and Jesus in the middle.
043	JOH	019	019	And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross: and there was written, JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS.
043	JOH	019	020	Many of the Jews therefore read this inscription; for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and it was written in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin.
043	JOH	019	021	And the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, Write not "The king of the Jews," but that "He said, I am king of the Jews."
043	JOH	019	022	Pilate answered, What I have written, I have written.
043	JOH	019	023	And the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, (and made four parts, to each soldier a part,) and his coat. Now the coat had no seam in it, being woven from the top throughout:
043	JOH	019	024	they said therefore to one another, Let us not cut it, but let us cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, "They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots." These things therefore the soldiers did.
043	JOH	019	025	Now there stood near the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleopas, and Mary Magdalene.
043	JOH	019	026	Jesus therefore seeing his mother, and the disciple whom He loved standing by, saith to his mother, Woman, behold thy son:
043	JOH	019	027	and then saith to the disciple, Behold thy mother. And from that hour the same disciple took her to his own home.
043	JOH	019	028	After this Jesus knowing that all things were now finished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst.
043	JOH	019	029	Now there was set a vessel there full of vinegar: so they filled a spunge with the vinegar, and putting it upon hyssop, held it up to his mouth.
043	JOH	019	030	And when Jesus had received the vinegar, He said, It is finished. And reclining his head, He yielded up the ghost.
043	JOH	019	031	The Jews therefore, that the bodies might not remain upon the cross on the sabbath-day, because it was now the preparation, (for that sabbath-day was an high-day) desired Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.
043	JOH	019	032	So the soldiers came, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other that was crucified with Him. But coming to Jesus,
043	JOH	019	033	as they saw He was dead already, they did not break his legs:
043	JOH	019	034	but one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and immediately there came out blood and water.
043	JOH	019	035	And he that saw it testifieth it, and his testimony is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye may believe.
043	JOH	019	036	For these things were done, that the scripture might be fulfilled, Not a bone of Him shall be broken.
043	JOH	019	037	And again another scripture saith, They shall look on Him whom they have pierced.
043	JOH	019	038	And after these things Joseph of Arimathea (who was a disciple of Jesus, but a concealed one for fear of the Jews) petitioned Pilate, that he might take away the body of Jesus; and Pilate gave him leave: he came therefore and took away the body of Jesus.
043	JOH	019	039	And there came also Nicodemus (who at first came to Jesus by night) and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes about an hundred pound weight.
043	JOH	019	040	So they took the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen cloths, with the spices, as the custom of the Jews is to bury.
043	JOH	019	041	Now there was a garden in the place where He was crucified; and in the garden a new sepulchre, in which none had ever yet been laid.
043	JOH	019	042	There therefore they laid Jesus, because of the Jews preparation-day; for the sepulchre was near.
043	JOH	020	001	Now on the first day of the week Mary Magdalene cometh early in the morning, while it was yet dark, to the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre.
043	JOH	020	002	She therefore runneth and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid Him.
043	JOH	020	003	Peter therefore went out, and that other disciple, and came to the sepulchre.
043	JOH	020	004	So they both ran together, but the other disciple out-ran Peter, and came first to the sepulchre:
043	JOH	020	005	and stooping down to look in saw the linen cloths lying; but did not go in.
043	JOH	020	006	Then cometh Simon Peter, who followed him, and went into the sepulchre, and seeth the linen cloths lying there;
043	JOH	020	007	and the napkin that was upon his head, not laid with the linen cloths, but folded up by itself.
043	JOH	020	008	Then went in also the other disciple; who came first to the sepulchre, and he saw and believed.
043	JOH	020	009	For they did not before understand the scripture, that He must rise from the dead.
043	JOH	020	010	So the two disciples went away again to their own company.
043	JOH	020	011	But Mary stood without near the sepulchre weeping: and as she wept she stooped down to look into the sepulchre; and there seeth two angels in white sitting,
043	JOH	020	012	one at the head, and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.
043	JOH	020	013	And they said to her, Woman, why dost thou weep? She saith unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid Him.
043	JOH	020	014	And having said this, she turned back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.
043	JOH	020	015	Then said Jesus to her, Woman, why dost thou weep? whom dost thou seek? She thinking that it was the gardener, saith to Him, Sir, if thou hast carried Him hence, tell me where thou hast laid Him, and I will take Him away.
043	JOH	020	016	Jesus saith unto her, Mary: and she turned herself and said unto Him, Rabboni, that is to say, Master.
043	JOH	020	017	Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not now; for I am not yet ascended to my Father; but go directly to my brethren, and tell them, "I am to ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God."
043	JOH	020	018	So Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples, that she had seen the Lord, and that He had said these things to her.
043	JOH	020	019	Now the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, and the doors where the disciples were being shut, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace be to you.
043	JOH	020	020	And when He had said this, He shewed them his hands and his side. The disciples therefore rejoiced when they saw the Lord.
043	JOH	020	021	Then said Jesus unto them again, Peace be to you. As my Father sent me, even so send I you.
043	JOH	020	022	And when He said this, He breathed upon them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the holy Spirit:
043	JOH	020	023	and whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; but whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained.
043	JOH	020	024	But Thomas called Didymus, one of the twelve, was not with them when Jesus came.
043	JOH	020	025	The other disciples therefore told him, We have seen the Lord. But he said unto them, Except I see in his hands the mark of the nails, and put my finger into the place of the nails, and my hand into his side, I will not believe.
043	JOH	020	026	And after eight days his disciples were again within, and Thomas with them: and Jesus came (the doors being shut as before) and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be to you.
043	JOH	020	027	Then saith He to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands, and reach hither thy hand, and put it into my side; and be not incredulous, but believing.
043	JOH	020	028	And Thomas answered, and said, "My Lord and my God."
043	JOH	020	029	Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.
043	JOH	020	030	And indeed Jesus wrought many other signs also in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book:
043	JOH	020	031	but these things are written, that ye may believe, that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye may have life through his name.
043	JOH	021	001	After these things Jesus shewed Himself again to the disciples near the sea of Tiberias; and He shewed Himself thus.
043	JOH	021	002	Simon Peter and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples were together:
043	JOH	021	003	and Simon Peter saith unto them, I will go a fishing, and they say to him, We will also go with thee. So they went out, and forthwith entered into a ship: and that night they caught nothing.
043	JOH	021	004	But when it was morning, Jesus stood on the shore: though the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.
043	JOH	021	005	Then Jesus saith unto them, Young men, have ye any thing to eat?
043	JOH	021	006	They answered Him, No. And He said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye will find some. So they cast it, and they were not able to draw it up by reason of the multitude of fishes.
043	JOH	021	007	Whereupon that disciple whom Jesus loved, saith to Peter, "It is the Lord." Then Simon Peter perceiving that it was the Lord, girded on his coat, (for he was stript,) and threw himself into the sea;
043	JOH	021	008	and the other disciples came in the boat dragging the net of fishes; for they were not far from the land, but about two hundred cubits.
043	JOH	021	009	And as soon as they were come to land, they saw a fire laid, and fish upon it, and bread.
043	JOH	021	010	And Jesus saith unto them, Bring some of the fish, which ye have now caught.
043	JOH	021	011	Then Simon Peter went aboard, and drew the net to land, full of large fishes, an hundred fifty-three: and though there were so many, the net was not broken.
043	JOH	021	012	Jesus saith unto them, Come, and dine. And none of the disciples presumed to ask Him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.
043	JOH	021	013	Jesus therefore cometh and taketh bread, and giveth it to them, and fish likewise.
043	JOH	021	014	This was the third time that Jesus shewed Himself to a number of his disciples, after He was risen from the dead.
043	JOH	021	015	Now when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon son of Jonas, dost thou love me more than these? He saith unto Him, Yes, Lord, Thou knowest that I love Thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs.
043	JOH	021	016	He saith to him again the second time, Simon son of Jonas, dost thou love me? He saith unto Him, Yes, Lord, Thou knowest that I love Thee.
043	JOH	021	017	He saith unto him, Feed my sheep. He saith unto him the third time, Simon son of Jonas, dost thou love me? Peter was grieved, that He said to him the third time, Dost thou love me? And he said unto Him, Lord, Thou knowest all things, Thou knowest that I love Thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep.
043	JOH	021	018	Verily, verily I say unto thee, When thou wast younger, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst about where thou wouldest: but when thou art old, thou shalt stretch out thine hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee where thou wouldest not.
043	JOH	021	019	This He said, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when He had said this, He saith unto him, Follow me.
043	JOH	021	020	And Peter turning about seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved, (and who leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, who is he that will betray Thee?) following them;
043	JOH	021	021	and upon seeing him, Peter saith to Jesus, Lord, what shall this man do?
043	JOH	021	022	Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he stay till I come, what is it to thee? Follow thou me.
043	JOH	021	023	This rumor therefore was spread among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: though Jesus did not say that he should not die, but---if I will that he stay till I come, what is that to thee?
043	JOH	021	024	This is the disciple that testifieth of these things, and that writeth them: and we know that his testimony is true.
043	JOH	021	025	There are also many other things that Jesus did, which if they were to be described particularly, I suppose that the whole world could not contain the books that would be written concerning them. Amen.

# BOOK	044	ACT	Acts	Acts
044	ACT	001	001	The former treatise, O Theophilus, I made concerning all that Jesus undertook both to do and to teach;
044	ACT	001	002	till the day in which He was taken up, after He had by the holy Spirit given instructions to the apostles whom He had chosen:
044	ACT	001	003	to whom also He presented Himself alive, after He had suffered, by many certain proofs; being seen among them for forty days, and speaking of the things relating to the kingdom of God.
044	ACT	001	004	And meeting them together He commanded them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, which, said He, ye have heard from me;
044	ACT	001	005	for John indeed baptized with water, but ye shall within a few days be baptized with the holy Spirit.
044	ACT	001	006	Being therefore come together they asked Him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?
044	ACT	001	007	And He said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or seasons, which the Father hath reserved in his own power.
044	ACT	001	008	But ye shall receive power from the holy Spirit coming upon you: and ye shall be my witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and Samaria, and to the uttermost part of the earth.
044	ACT	001	009	And having said these things, as they were looking upon Him, He was lifted up, and a cloud received Him out of their sight.
044	ACT	001	010	And while they were looking stedfastly toward heaven, as He went up, behold two men in white stood by them;
044	ACT	001	011	who said, Ye men of Galilee, why do ye stand gazing up to heaven? This Jesus who is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in the manner ye have seen Him going into heaven.
044	ACT	001	012	Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mountain called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath-day's journey.
044	ACT	001	013	And when they were come in to the city, they went up into an upper room, where Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alpheus, and Simon the zealot, and Jude the brother of James, usually abode.
044	ACT	001	014	These all persevered with one accord in prayer and supplication with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and his brethren.
044	ACT	001	015	And in these days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, (now the number of the persons that were together was about an hundred and twenty,)
044	ACT	001	016	and said, Men and brethren, it was necessary that this scripture should be fulfilled, which the holy Ghost spake by the mouth of David, concerning Judas, who was guide to them that apprehended Jesus:
044	ACT	001	017	for he was numbered with us, and had obtained a part of this ministry.
044	ACT	001	018	(Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling down on his face, burst asunder in the middle, and all his bowels gushed out:
044	ACT	001	019	(and it was known to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the field is called in their own dialect, Aceldama, that is, the field of blood:)
044	ACT	001	020	for it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let none dwell in it; and again, Let another take his office.)
044	ACT	001	021	Wherefore it is necessary that one of these men, who have been conversant with us all the time that the Lord Jesus came in and out among us,
044	ACT	001	022	from the baptism of John, till the day that He was taken up from us, should be joined with us as a witness of his resurrection.
044	ACT	001	023	And they proposed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.
044	ACT	001	024	And they prayed and said, Thou, Lord, who knowest the hearts of all, shew us, which of these two Thou hast chosen,
044	ACT	001	025	to take part of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas is fallen by his transgression, that he might go to his own place.
044	ACT	001	026	And they gave out their lots, and the lot fell upon Matthias, and he was numbered with the apostles.
044	ACT	002	001	And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all met together with one accord.
044	ACT	002	002	And suddenly there was a sound from heaven as of a strong rushing wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.
044	ACT	002	003	And there appeared unto them divided tongues, as it were of fire, and it sat upon each of them:
044	ACT	002	004	and they were all filled with the holy Spirit, and began to speak in other languages, as the Spirit gave them utterance.
044	ACT	002	005	Now there were at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, from every nation under heaven.
044	ACT	002	006	And when this rumor was spread, the multitude came together and were astonished; for every one heard them speaking in his own language.
044	ACT	002	007	And they were all amazed and wondered, saying to one another, Behold, are not all these, that are speaking, Galileans?
044	ACT	002	008	and how do we every one hear them in our own native tongue?
044	ACT	002	009	Parthians and Medes and Elamites, and those that dwell in Mesopotamia, and Judea, and Capadocia, Pontus and Asia, Phrygia and Pamphylia,
044	ACT	002	010	Egypt and the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers from Rome, Jews and proselytes,
044	ACT	002	011	Cretans and Arabians, we hear them speaking in our own tongues the wonderful works of God.
044	ACT	002	012	And they were all amazed and in doubt, saying one to another, What can this mean?
044	ACT	002	013	but others scoffing said, they are full of sweet wine.
044	ACT	002	014	But Peter standing up with the eleven, raised his voice and said unto them, Ye men of Judea, and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and listen to my words:
044	ACT	002	015	for these men are not drunk, as ye suppose; for it is but the third hour of the day.
044	ACT	002	016	But this is that which was spoken of by the prophet Joel,
044	ACT	002	017	"And it shall come to pass in the last days (saith God) that I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy; and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:
044	ACT	002	018	yea and on my servants and on my handmaids, in those days, I will pour out of my Spirit, and they also shall prophesy.
044	ACT	002	019	And I will give prodigies in the heaven, and signs upon the earth; blood, and fire, and smoky vapour.
044	ACT	002	020	The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before that great and illustrious day of the Lord come.
044	ACT	002	021	And whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord, shall be saved."
044	ACT	002	022	Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you, by miracles, and prodigies, and signs, which God wrought by Him in the midst of you,
044	ACT	002	023	(as ye yourselves also know,) Him being given up by the determinate counsel and fore-knowlege of God ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain.
044	ACT	002	024	Whom God hath raised up again, having loosed the pains of death, because it was not possible that He should be held by it.
044	ACT	002	025	For David saith concerning Him, "I set the Lord always before me, for He is at my right hand, that I should not be moved: therefore my heart rejoiced, and my tongue was glad;
044	ACT	002	026	and my flesh shall rest in hope,
044	ACT	002	027	that Thou wilt not leave my soul in the invisible state, nor suffer thine holy one to see corruption.
044	ACT	002	028	Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; and Thou wilt fill me with joy by the light of thy countenance."
044	ACT	002	029	Men and brethren, allow me to speak with freedom to you concerning the patriarch David, that he is dead and buried, and his sepulchre is among us to this day.
044	ACT	002	030	Therefore being a prophet; and knowing that God had sworn to him with an oath, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up the Messiah, to sit on his throne;
044	ACT	002	031	foreseeing this he spake of the resurrection of Christ, when he said, that his soul was not left in the invisible state, nor did his flesh see corruption.
044	ACT	002	032	This Jesus hath God raised up from the dead, of which we all are witnesses.
044	ACT	002	033	Therefore being exalted by the right hand of God, and having received of the Father the promise of the holy Spirit, He hath poured forth this gift, which ye now see and hear.
044	ACT	002	034	For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he himself says, "The Lord said to my Lord,
044	ACT	002	035	Sit thou at my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool."
044	ACT	002	036	Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made this very Jesus, whom ye crucified, both Lord and Christ.
044	ACT	002	037	Now when they heard this, they were pricked to the heart, and said unto Peter, and to the rest of the apostles, Brethren, what shall we do?
044	ACT	002	038	And Peter said unto them, Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of your sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the holy Spirit:
044	ACT	002	039	for the promise is to you and to your children, yea and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.
044	ACT	002	040	And with many other words did he press and exhort them, saying, Save yourselves from this perverse generation.
044	ACT	002	041	They therefore that received his word with readiness were baptized: and in that same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls.
044	ACT	002	042	And they continued stedfast in the apostles doctrine, and fellowship, and in the breaking of bread, and in prayers.
044	ACT	002	043	And fear came upon all the people: and many miracles and signs were wrought by the apostles.
044	ACT	002	044	And all that believed were together, and had all things common.
044	ACT	002	045	And they sold their possessions and goods, and distributed to all, according as any one had need.
044	ACT	002	046	And continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, they partook of their food with gladness and simplicity of heart,
044	ACT	002	047	praising God, and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.
044	ACT	003	001	Now Peter and John were going up to the temple together at the hour of prayer, which is the ninth hour.
044	ACT	003	002	And a certain man who had been lame from his birth was carried along; whom they laid every day at the gate of the temple, which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of those that were going into the temple:
044	ACT	003	003	who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, asked alms of them.
044	ACT	003	004	But Peter, and John, looking earnestly at him said, Look on us.
044	ACT	003	005	And he fixed his eyes upon them, expecting to receive something from them.
044	ACT	003	006	But Peter said, Silver and gold I have not; but what I have I give thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk.
044	ACT	003	007	And taking him by the right hand, he raised him up: and immediately his feet and ancles were strengthened:
044	ACT	003	008	and leaping up he stood firm, and walked; and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.
044	ACT	003	009	And all the people saw him walking and praising God:
044	ACT	003	010	and knew that it was he who sat to ask for alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple: and they were filled with astonishment and extasy at what had befallen him.
044	ACT	003	011	And as the lame man that was healed had hold of Peter and John, all the people being astonished ran together to them to the porch called Solomon's porch.
044	ACT	003	012	And Peter seeing this said to the people, Men of Israel, why marvel ye at this, or why look ye so earnestly on us, as if by our own power or piety we had made this man able to walk?
044	ACT	003	013	The God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob, the God of our fathers hath glorified his son Jesus, whom ye delivered up, and denied before Pilate, when he determined to release Him.
044	ACT	003	014	But ye refused the holy and righteous One, and desired a murderer to be granted unto you:
044	ACT	003	015	and put to death the prince of life; whom God hath raised from the dead, of which we are witnesses.
044	ACT	003	016	And through faith in his name, hath strengthened this man, whom ye see and know: his name, I say, and saith in Him, hath wrought this perfect cure before you all.
044	ACT	003	017	And now, brethren, I know that ye did it through ignorance, as did also your rulers:
044	ACT	003	018	but thus hath God accomplished those things which He had foretold by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer.
044	ACT	003	019	Repent therefore and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out: that seasons of refreshing may come upon you from the presence of the Lord;
044	ACT	003	020	and He may send Jesus Christ, who was before preached unto you:
044	ACT	003	021	whom heaven must indeed receive till the times of settling all things, of which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets from the beginning.
044	ACT	003	022	For Moses said unto the fathers, the Lord your God will raise up a prophet unto you, of your brethren, like me, Him shall ye hear in all things whatever He shall say unto you;
044	ACT	003	023	and every soul, who will not hearken to that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people: yea and all the prophets from Samuel,
044	ACT	003	024	and those that followed, as many as have prophesied, have also foretold these days.
044	ACT	003	025	Now ye are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant, which God made with our fathers, saying to Abraham, "And in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed:"
044	ACT	003	026	and to you first God having raised up his son Jesus, sent Him to bless you; in your turning away every one of you from your iniquities.
044	ACT	004	001	And while they were speaking to the people, the priests, and the captain of the temple, and the sadducees came upon them,
044	ACT	004	002	being vexed that they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead.
044	ACT	004	003	And they laid hands on them, and put them into custody till the next day: for it was now evening.
044	ACT	004	004	But many of them who heard the word, believed: and the number of the men was about five thousand.
044	ACT	004	005	And on the morrow their rulers, and elders, and scribes were gathered together at Jerusalem:
044	ACT	004	006	and with them Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest.
044	ACT	004	007	And when they had set them in the midst, they asked them, By what power, or in what name have ye done this?
044	ACT	004	008	Then Peter filled with the holy Spirit said unto them, Ye rulers of the people,
044	ACT	004	009	and elders of Israel, if we are this day examined about the benefit done to the impotent man,
044	ACT	004	010	by what means he is cured, be it known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, but whom God hath raised from the dead, even by Him doth this man stand here before you whole.
044	ACT	004	011	This is the stone that was set at nought by you builders, which is become the head of the corner.
044	ACT	004	012	And there is salvation in no other; for there is no other name under heaven given among men, by which we can be saved.
044	ACT	004	013	Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were plain and illiterate men, they were amazed; and they knew them again that they had been with Jesus:
044	ACT	004	014	but seeing the man that was cured standing with them, they had nothing to say against it.
044	ACT	004	015	Therefore they ordered them to withdraw from the council,
044	ACT	004	016	and conferred among themselves, saying, What shall we do with these men? for that indeed an evident miracle hath been wrought by them is manifest to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it.
044	ACT	004	017	But that it may spread no farther among the people, let us severely charge them to speak no more to any man in this name.
044	ACT	004	018	So they called them and commanded them not to speak at all, nor teach in the name of Jesus.
044	ACT	004	019	But Peter and John answered them, and said, Whether it be right in the sight of God to obey you rather than God, judge ye:
044	ACT	004	020	for we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.
044	ACT	004	021	So they threatened them more severely, and let them go; not finding how to punish them, because of the people: for they all glorified God for that which was done.
044	ACT	004	022	For the man was above forty years old, on whom this miraculous cure was wrought.
044	ACT	004	023	Being dismissed they went to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said to them.
044	ACT	004	024	And when they heard it, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, Thou art God, who hast made heaven and earth, and sea, and all things therein:
044	ACT	004	025	who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said, Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things?
044	ACT	004	026	The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord and against his anointed.
044	ACT	004	027	For of a truth both Herod and Pontius Pilate, the Gentiles and the people of Israel, combined against thy holy child Jesus,
044	ACT	004	028	(whom Thou hast anointed,) to do whatever thy hand and thy counsel had before determined to be done.
044	ACT	004	029	And now, Lord, behold their threatenings; and give unto thy servants to speak thy word with all freedom, while Thou art stretching forth thy hand to heal,
044	ACT	004	030	and while signs and wonders are done by the name of thy holy child Jesus.
044	ACT	004	031	And when they had prayed, the place in which they were assembled was shaken; and they were all filled with the holy Spirit, and they spake the word of God with freedom.
044	ACT	004	032	And the heart and soul of the multitude that believed was one: no one called any of his possessions his own property, but they had all things common.
044	ACT	004	033	And with great power did the apostles give their testimony of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all.
044	ACT	004	034	Neither was there any indigent person among them; for as many as were proprietors of lands or houses, sold them and brought the prices of what were sold,
044	ACT	004	035	and laid them at the apostles feet; and distribution was made to every one according to their necessity.
044	ACT	004	036	So Joses who was by the apostles sirnamed Barnabas, which is a son of consolation,
044	ACT	004	037	a Levite, by birth a Cyprian, having an estate, sold it and brought the money, and laid it at the feet of the apostles.
044	ACT	005	001	But a certain man named Ananias, together with Sapphira his wife,
044	ACT	005	002	sold a possession, and secreted part of the price, his wife also being conscious to it; and bringing: some part, laid it at the feet of the apostles.
044	ACT	005	003	But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan so filled thine heart, that thou shouldst lie to the holy Ghost, and keep back part of the price of the land?
044	ACT	005	004	While it remained, did it not remain thy own? and when sold, was it not in thy own power? what is the meaning that thou hast taken this into thine heart? Thou hast not lyed to men, but to God.
044	ACT	005	005	And Ananias at the hearing of these words fell down and expired: and great fear came on all that heard these things.
044	ACT	005	006	And some of the young men arose, and wrapped him up; and they carried him out, and buried him.
044	ACT	005	007	And about the space of three hours after, his wife also came in, not knowing what had happened.
044	ACT	005	008	And Peter said to her, Tell me whether ye sold the land for so much. And she said, Yes, for so much.
044	ACT	005	009	Then Peter said unto her, Wherefore have ye agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? behold the feet of those, who have been burying thy husband, now at the door, and they shall carry thee out.
044	ACT	005	010	And immediately she fell down at his feet and expired: and the young men coming in found her dead, and they carried her out and buried her by her husband.
044	ACT	005	011	And great fear came upon the whole assembly, and upon all that heard these things.
044	ACT	005	012	And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders done among the people: And they all met with one accord in Solomon's portico:
044	ACT	005	013	but no other presumed to join himself to them; however the people magnified them.
044	ACT	005	014	And true believers were the more willingly added to the Lord, even multitudes both of men and women.
044	ACT	005	015	insomuch that they brought the sick out into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that at lest the shadow of Peter, as he came by, might pass over some of them.
044	ACT	005	016	And a great number out of the cities round about also came together to Jerusalem, bringing those that were infirm and that were troubled with impure spirits; and they were all cured.
044	ACT	005	017	Then the high priest rose up, and all that were with him, (being of the sect of the sadducees,) and were filled with rage:
044	ACT	005	018	and laid their hands on the apostles, and put them in the public prison.
044	ACT	005	019	But an angel of the Lord opened the doors of the prison by night, and having brought them out said,
044	ACT	005	020	"Go stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life."
044	ACT	005	021	And hearing this, they went early in the morning into the temple and taught the people. But the high priest being come, and they that were with him, to the council-chamber, they called together the Sanhedrim, and all the senate of the children of Israel, and sent orders to the prison that they should be brought before them.
044	ACT	005	022	But when the officers came they found them not in the prison: so they returned,
044	ACT	005	023	and told them, saying, the prison we found shut with all safety, and the keepers standing without before the doors: but when we opened them, we found no body within.
044	ACT	005	024	Now when the high priest, and the captain of the temple, and the chief priests heard these words, they were in doubt concerning them, what this would come to;
044	ACT	005	025	when there came one and told them, saying, behold, the men whom ye put in prison, are in the temple teaching the people.
044	ACT	005	026	Then the captain went with the officers and brought them, but not with violence; for they were afraid of the people least they should be stoned:
044	ACT	005	027	and when they had brought them, they set them before the council. And the high priest asked them,
044	ACT	005	028	saying, Did not we strictly charge you not to teach in this name? and behold ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and would bring this man's blood upon us.
044	ACT	005	029	But Peter, and the other apostles, answered, and said, We ought to obey God rather than men.
044	ACT	005	030	The God of our fathers hath raised up Jesus whom ye slew and hanged on a tree.
044	ACT	005	031	Him hath God exalted with his right hand as a prince and saviour, to give repentance to Israel, and remission of sins:
044	ACT	005	032	and we are his witnesses of what we declare; and so is the holy Spirit, whom God hath given to them that obey Him.
044	ACT	005	033	And when they heard this, they were cut to the heart, and took counsel to put them to death.
044	ACT	005	034	But a certain pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, held in much esteem by all the people, stood up in the council, and ordered the apostles to be taken out a little while; and then he said unto them,
044	ACT	005	035	Men of Israel, take heed to yourselves, what ye are about to do, as to these men.
044	ACT	005	036	For some time ago one Theudas arose, pretending to be some extraordinary person, to whom was joined a number of men, about four hundred: who was slain, and all that followed him were dispersed and came to nothing.
044	ACT	005	037	After him arose Judas the Galilean, at the time of the registring, and drew much people after him: but he also perished, and all that followed him were dispersed.
044	ACT	005	038	And therefore as to the present affair I advise you to refrain from these men and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nothing;
044	ACT	005	039	but if it be of God, ye cannot defeat it, least ye be found fighting even against God.
044	ACT	005	040	So they took his advice, and having called for the apostles and scourged them, they charged them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.
044	ACT	005	041	And they departed from the presence of the council rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer disgrace for his name.
044	ACT	005	042	And every day in the temple and from house to house they ceased not from teaching and preaching that Jesus was the Christ.
044	ACT	006	001	Now in those days, as the number of disciples increased, there rose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily distribution.
044	ACT	006	002	So the twelve called the multitude of the disciples to them and said, It is not seemly that we should leave the word of God and attend at tables.
044	ACT	006	003	Wherefore, brethren, look out from among you seven men of good character, full of the holy Spirit, and of wisdom, whom we may appoint over this matter:
044	ACT	006	004	but we will constantly attend to prayer, and to the ministry of the word.
044	ACT	006	005	And the advice pleased the whole multitude, and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith, and of the holy Spirit, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolaus a proselyte of Antioch.
044	ACT	006	006	These they set before the apostles; who, when they had prayed, laid their hands upon them.
044	ACT	006	007	And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples in Jerusalem was greatly multiplied; and a great number of the priests became obedient to the faith.
044	ACT	006	008	Now Stephen being full of grace and power, wrought miracles and great signs among the people.
044	ACT	006	009	But there rose up some of the synagogue, which is called that of the libertines, and some of the Cyrenians, and of the Alexandrians, and of them of Cilicia, and Asia, to dispute with Stephen:
044	ACT	006	010	and they were not able to resist the wisdom and spirit by which he spake.
044	ACT	006	011	Then they suborned men to say, we heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and against God.
044	ACT	006	012	And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes; and they came upon him, and forced him along with them, and brought him to the council:
044	ACT	006	013	and they set up false witnesses; who said, This man is continually speaking blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law.
044	ACT	006	014	For we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and change the rites which Moses delivered to us.
044	ACT	006	015	(And all that were sitting in the council, looking stedfastly at him, saw his face like the face of an angel.)
044	ACT	007	001	Then said the high priest, Are these things so?
044	ACT	007	002	And he said, "Brethren and fathers, hearken, ---The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charran,
044	ACT	007	003	and said to him, Depart from thy native country and from thy kindred, and come into the country which I shall shew thee.
044	ACT	007	004	Then he came out of the land of the Chaldeans, and dwelt in Charran: and from thence, after his father died, He removed him into this land in which ye now dwell:
044	ACT	007	005	though He gave him no inheritance in it, no not the breadth of a foot; but He promised to give it to him for a possession, even to his seed after him; though he had then no child."
044	ACT	007	006	And God spake thus unto him, "that his seed should sojourn in a strange country, and they shall in slave and abuse them four hundred years:"
044	ACT	007	007	and God said, "I will judge the nation, to which they shall be in slavery; and afterwards they shall come out, and shall worship me in this place."
044	ACT	007	008	And He gave him the covenant of circumcision: and he begat Isaac, and circumcised him on the eighth day; and Isaac Jacob, and Jacob the twelve patriarchs.
044	ACT	007	009	And the patriarchs, envying him, sold Joseph into Egypt: but God was with him,
044	ACT	007	010	and delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favor and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he appointed him governor over Egypt, and over all his houshold.
044	ACT	007	011	And there came a famine over all the land of Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction; and our fathers could not find sustenance.
044	ACT	007	012	But Jacob hearing that there was corn in Egypt, sent out our fathers first:
044	ACT	007	013	and at the second time Joseph was made known to his brethren; and Joseph's kindred was made known to Pharaoh.
044	ACT	007	014	Then Joseph sent for his father Jacob, and all his kindred, even seventy-five souls.
044	ACT	007	015	So Jacob went down into Egypt, and died there, he and our fathers:
044	ACT	007	016	and were carried to Sychem, and laid in the sepulchre which he had bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor the father of Sychem.
044	ACT	007	017	But as the time of the promise drew near, which God had sworn to Abraham, the people increased and multiplied in Egypt.
044	ACT	007	018	Till another king arose, who knew not Joseph. This king formed crafty schemes against our nation,
044	ACT	007	019	and oppressed our fathers, causing their children to be exposed, that their race might be extinguished.
044	ACT	007	020	In which time Moses was born, who was exceeding beautiful, and he was nourished up in his father's house three months: and when he was exposed,
044	ACT	007	021	Pharaoh's daughter took him up and nourished him for her own son.
044	ACT	007	022	And Moses was trained up in all the wisdom of the Egyptians: and he was mighty in words, and in deeds.
044	ACT	007	023	And when he was full forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of Israel.
044	ACT	007	024	And seeing one of them injured he defended him, and smiting the Egyptian he avenged him that was wronged.
044	ACT	007	025	Now he supposed that his brethren would have understood that God would give them deliverance by his hand: but they understood not.
044	ACT	007	026	And the next day he came to them, as they were two of them fighting, and would have persuaded them to agree, saying, Sirs, ye are brethren, why do ye injure one another?
044	ACT	007	027	But he, that injured his neighbor, thrust him away, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us?
044	ACT	007	028	Wilt thou kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian yesterday?
044	ACT	007	029	Upon this Moses fled, and became a sojourner in the land of Midian, where he begat two sons.
044	ACT	007	030	And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount Sina, an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a bush.
044	ACT	007	031	Now Moses, when he saw it, was amazed at the sight; and as he came near to observe it, there was a voice of the Lord to him,
044	ACT	007	032	saying, "I am the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob;" but Moses trembling durst not look on.
044	ACT	007	033	And the Lord said to him, "Take off thy shoes from thy feet: for the place on which thou standest is holy ground.
044	ACT	007	034	I have seen the oppression of my people that are in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and am come down to deliver them. Therefore come now, and I will send thee into Egypt."
044	ACT	007	035	This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge? did God send, by the hand of the angel that appeared to him in the bush, to be their ruler and deliverer.
044	ACT	007	036	And he brought them out, performing wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and in the red sea, and in the wilderness, forty years.
044	ACT	007	037	---This is that Moses who said unto the children of Israel, "A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you, of your brethren, like unto me; Him shall ye hear."
044	ACT	007	038	This is he who was in the assembly in the wilderness, with the angel that spake to him on mount Sinai, and with our fathers; and who received the oracles of life to give unto us.
044	ACT	007	039	To whom our fathers would not be subject, but renounced him, and in their hearts turned back into Egypt,
044	ACT	007	040	saying to Aaron, Make us gods to go before us; for as to this Moses, who brought us out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him. And they made a calf in those days,
044	ACT	007	041	and offered sacrifice to the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands.
044	ACT	007	042	Then God turned away, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven, as it is written in the book of the prophets, "O house of Israel, did ye offer to me your victims and sacrifices, for the space of forty years in the wilderness?
044	ACT	007	043	yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, figures which ye made to worship them by: and I will carry you away beyond Babylon."
044	ACT	007	044	The tabernacle of witness was among our fathers in the wilderness, as He, that spake unto Moses, ordered him to make it according to the model which he had seen in the mount:
044	ACT	007	045	and which our fathers receiving, they with Joshua, brought into the territory of the nations, whom God drove out from before the face of our fathers, till the days of David, who found favor in the sight of God,
044	ACT	007	046	and was desirous to provide an habitation for the God of Jacob.
044	ACT	007	047	But Solomon built Him an house.
044	ACT	007	048	Though the most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands, as the prophet saith,
044	ACT	007	049	"Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool; what house will ye build for me, saith the Lord, or what is the place of my rest?
044	ACT	007	050	hath not my hand made all these things?" ---
044	ACT	007	051	Ye stiff-necked, and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the holy Spirit: as your fathers did, so do ye.
044	ACT	007	052	Which of the prophets did not your fathers persecute? and slew those who prophesied concerning the coming of that righteous One, of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers;
044	ACT	007	053	who received the law by the ministration of angels, and yet have not kept it.
044	ACT	007	054	And when they heard these things, they were cut to the heart and gnashed their teeth at him.
044	ACT	007	055	But he being full of the holy Spirit looked up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God:
044	ACT	007	056	and he said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing at the right hand of God.
044	ACT	007	057	Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and ran upon him with one accord,
044	ACT	007	058	and cast him out of the city and stoned him: and the witnesses laid down their clothes at the feet of a young man, whose name was Saul.
044	ACT	007	059	And they stoned Stephen calling upon God, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.
044	ACT	007	060	And bending his knees, he cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this he fell asleep.
044	ACT	008	001	And Saul was well pleased with his execution. For at that time there was a great persecution against the church in Jerusalem, and they were all dispersed through the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles.
044	ACT	008	002	And some pious men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation for him.
044	ACT	008	003	But Saul made havock of the church, entring into the houses, and dragging out men and women, committed them to prison.
044	ACT	008	004	Now they that were dispersed went about preaching the word.
044	ACT	008	005	And Philip coming to the city of Samaria, preached Christ unto them.
044	ACT	008	006	And the people unanimously attended to the things which were spoken by Philip, hearing and seeing the miracles which he wrought:
044	ACT	008	007	for impure spirits crying with a loud voice came out of many that were possessed by them; and many paralytic and lame persons were cured.
044	ACT	008	008	And there was great joy in that city.
044	ACT	008	009	But there was before in the city a man named Simon practising magic and bewitching the people of Samaria, giving out that he was some great person.
044	ACT	008	010	Whom they all greatly regarded, from the lest to the greatest, saying, This man is as the great power of God.
044	ACT	008	011	And they were attentive to him, because he had for a considerable time astonished them by his magic arts.
044	ACT	008	012	But as they believed Philip, preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women;
044	ACT	008	013	and Simon himself also believed, and was baptized, and kept constantly with Philip: and beholding the signs and miracles that were wrought, he was amazed.
044	ACT	008	014	Now when the apostles at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent to them Peter and John:
044	ACT	008	015	who when they were come down prayed for them that they might receive the holy Spirit: (for He was not yet fallen upon any of them,
044	ACT	008	016	only they were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus:) and then they laid their hands on them,
044	ACT	008	017	and they received the holy Spirit.
044	ACT	008	018	And when Simon saw that the holy Spirit was given by the imposition of the hands of the apostles, he offered them money,
044	ACT	008	019	saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the holy Spirit.
044	ACT	008	020	But Peter said unto him, Let thy money perish with thee, since thou thoughtest to purchase the gift of God with money.
044	ACT	008	021	Thou hast no part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God.
044	ACT	008	022	Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray to God, if so be the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee:
044	ACT	008	023	for I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness and bond of iniquity.
044	ACT	008	024	And Simon answered, and said, Do ye pray to the Lord for me, that none of the things which ye have spoken may come upon me.
044	ACT	008	025	And they having testified and declared the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.
044	ACT	008	026	And an angel of the Lord spake to Philip, saying, Arise and go southward to the way that leads down from Jerusalem to Gaza, which is desert.
044	ACT	008	027	And he arose and went; and behold a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, and her high-treasurer, who had come to Jerusalem to worship,
044	ACT	008	028	was returning, and as he sat in his chariot, was reading the prophet Esaias:
044	ACT	008	029	and the Spirit said to Philip, Go near and join thyself to this chariot. And Philip running up to him,
044	ACT	008	030	heard him reading the prophet Esaias, and said, Dost thou understand what thou readest?
044	ACT	008	031	And he said, How can I, unless some one guide me? and he desired Philip to come up and sit with him.
044	ACT	008	032	And the portion of scripture, which he was reading, was this, "He was led as a sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb before it's shearer is dumb, so He opened not his mouth:
044	ACT	008	033	in his humiliation his judgement was taken away, and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken away from the earth."
044	ACT	008	034	And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom doth the prophet say this? of himself, or of some other person?
044	ACT	008	035	Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning at this scripture, preached unto him Jesus.
044	ACT	008	036	And as they went on their way, they came to a certain water: and the eunuch said, See here is water, what hindereth me from being baptized?
044	ACT	008	037	And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.
044	ACT	008	038	And he ordered the chariot to stop: and they both went down to the water, Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.
044	ACT	008	039	And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, and the eunuch saw him no more: but went on his way rejoicing.
044	ACT	008	040	But Philip was found at Azotus; and as he passed along, he preached the gospel in all the cities, till he came to Cesarea.
044	ACT	009	001	But Saul still breathing out threatnings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, came to the high priest, and desired of him letters to the synagogues at Damascus,
044	ACT	009	002	that if he should find any of this persuasion, men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.
044	ACT	009	003	And as he was on his journey, and came near to Damascus, suddenly there shone round about him a light from heaven;
044	ACT	009	004	and he fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?
044	ACT	009	005	And he said, Who art Thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus the Nazarene whom thou art persecuting: it is hard for thee to kick against the goads.
044	ACT	009	006	And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt Thou have me to do? And the Lord said unto him, Arise and go into the city, and it shall be told thee, what thou must do.
044	ACT	009	007	And the men that went along with him, stood astonished, hearing the voice, but seeing no one.
044	ACT	009	008	And Saul rose from the earth, but when he opened his eyes he could not see: so they led him by the hand, and brought him to Damascus.
044	ACT	009	009	And he was three days without sight, and did neither eat nor drink.
044	ACT	009	010	Now there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias, and the Lord said to him in a vision, Ananias, and he said, Behold, I am here, Lord.
044	ACT	009	011	And the Lord said unto him, Arise and go into the street which is called Strait, and enquire in the house of Judas for one Saul, of Tarsus:
044	ACT	009	012	for behold he is praying, and hath seen in a vision a man named Ananias, coming in and putting his hand upon him, that he might recover his sight.
044	ACT	009	013	And Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard from many of this man, how much mischief he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem:
044	ACT	009	014	and here too he hath authority from the chief priests to apprehend all that call upon thy name.
044	ACT	009	015	But the Lord said unto him, Go thy way, for he is the instrument I have chosen, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel:
044	ACT	009	016	for I will shew him how great sufferings he must endure for my name.
044	ACT	009	017	And Ananias went away and came into the house; and putting his hands on him, said, "Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, who appeared to thee on the way as thou camest, hath sent me, that thou mightest receive thy sight, and be filled with the holy Spirit."
044	ACT	009	018	And immediately there fell from his eyes as it were scales; and he instantly recovered his sight, and arose and was baptized.
044	ACT	009	019	And when he had taken some nourishment, he was strengthened. Now Saul was with the disciples at Damascus for some time.
044	ACT	009	020	And he immediately preached Christ in the synagogues, that He is the Son of God.
044	ACT	009	021	But all that heard him, were amazed, and said, Is not this he that persecuted those in Jerusalem who called on this name, and came hither for this end, that he might carry them bound to the chief priests?
044	ACT	009	022	But Saul prevailed more and more, and confounded the Jews that dwelt at Damascus, fully proving that this same Jesus is the Christ.
044	ACT	009	023	And after a considerable time, the Jews conspired to kill him:
044	ACT	009	024	but Saul was apprised of their design. And they watched the gates day and night, to make away with him:
044	ACT	009	025	but the disciples took him by night, and let him down by the wall, in a basket.
044	ACT	009	026	And when Saul was come to Jerusalem, he attempted to associate with the disciples: and they were all afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple.
044	ACT	009	027	But Barnabas took and brought him to the apostles, and related to them, how he had seen the Lord in the way, and that He had spoken to him; and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus.
044	ACT	009	028	And he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem, and preaching openly in the name of the Lord Jesus:
044	ACT	009	029	and he talked and disputed with the Hellenists, who attempted to kill him:
044	ACT	009	030	but when the brethren knew it, they brought him down to Cesarea, and sent him away to Tarsus.
044	ACT	009	031	Then the churches throughout all Judea, and Galilee, and Samaria, had rest, being edified and walking in the fear of the Lord; and through the consolation of the holy Spirit were multiplied.
044	ACT	009	032	And it came to pass that as Peter was going through all parts, he came down also to the saints that dwelt at Lydda.
044	ACT	009	033	And there he found a man named Eneas, who had kept his bed eight years, with the palsy.
044	ACT	009	034	And Peter said unto him, Eneas, Jesus the Messiah, healeth thee. Arise, and make thy bed. And he rose up immediately.
044	ACT	009	035	And all that dwelt at Lydda and in Saron saw him, and turned to the Lord.
044	ACT	009	036	And there was at Joppa a certain female disciple named Tabitha, who by interpretation is called in Greek Dorcas: and she was full of good works and alms-deeds.
044	ACT	009	037	And it happened, about the same time, that she fell sick and died: and when they had washed her they laid her out in an upper chamber.
044	ACT	009	038	And as Lydda was near to Joppa, the disciples hearing that Peter was there sent two men to him, intreating him that he would not delay to come to them.
044	ACT	009	039	Then Peter arose, and went with them: and when he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber. And all the widows stood round him weeping, and shewing him the coats and garments which Dorcas made when she was with them.
044	ACT	009	040	But Peter, putting them all out, kneeled down and prayed: and then turning to the body he said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter, she sat up.
044	ACT	009	041	And giving her his hand he raised her up, and calling the saints and widows he presented her alive.
044	ACT	009	042	And it was soon known throughout all Joppa, and many believed on the Lord.
044	ACT	009	043	And he staid many days in Joppa with one Simon a tanner.
044	ACT	010	001	Now there was a certain man at Cesarea named Cornelius, a centurion of the band called the Italian band: a pious man,
044	ACT	010	002	and one that feared God, with all his house; giving also much alms to the people, and praying to God continually.
044	ACT	010	003	He evidently saw in a vision, about the ninth hour of the day, an angel of God coming in to him, and saying unto him, Cornelius!
044	ACT	010	004	and he looking earnestly at him, and being afraid, said, What is it, Lord? And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are come up as a memorial before God.
044	ACT	010	005	And now send men to Joppa, and fetch hither one Simon, whose sirname is Peter.
044	ACT	010	006	He lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea-side: he shall tell thee what thou must do.
044	ACT	010	007	As soon as the angel, that spake to Cornelius, was departed, he called two of his domestic servants, and a devout soldier, that constantly attended him.
044	ACT	010	008	And when he had related all to them, he sent them to Joppa.
044	ACT	010	009	On the morrow, while they were on their journey, and drawing near to the city, Peter went up on the top of the house to pray, about the sixth hour.
044	ACT	010	010	And he was very hungry, and desired something to eat: but while they were getting it ready, he fell into a trance; and saw heaven opened,
044	ACT	010	011	and some thing descending to him, like a great sheet tied at the four corners, and let down to the earth:
044	ACT	010	012	in which were all kinds of four-footed creatures, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.
044	ACT	010	013	And there was a voice which said to him, Rise, Peter, kill and eat.
044	ACT	010	014	But Peter said, By no means, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing polluted or unclean.
044	ACT	010	015	And the voice said to him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, do not thou account polluted.
044	ACT	010	016	This was done thrice, and the vessel was taken up again into heaven.
044	ACT	010	017	Now while Peter was doubting in himself what might be the meaning of the vision which he had seen, behold the men that were sent from Cornelius, having enquired for Simon's house, stood at the door;
044	ACT	010	018	and called, and asked, if Simon sirnamed Peter lodged there.
044	ACT	010	019	And as Peter was pondering upon the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold there are three men enquiring for thee:
044	ACT	010	020	arise therefore and go down, and go along with them, doubting nothing; for I have sent them.
044	ACT	010	021	Then Peter went down to the men that were sent to him from Cornelius, and said, Behold I am the person whom ye seek: what is the cause for which ye are come?
044	ACT	010	022	And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a righteous man, and one that feareth God, and of a good character among all the nation of the Jews, hath been warned from God by an holy angel, to send for thee to his house, and to hear what thou shalt say.
044	ACT	010	023	Then he invited them in, and entertained them that night. And on the morrow Peter set out with them; and some of the brethren from Joppa went with him.
044	ACT	010	024	And the next day they came into Cesarea; and Cornelius was waiting for them, having called together his relations and intimate friends.
044	ACT	010	025	And as Peter came in, Cornelius met him, and falling down at his feet did him reverence.
044	ACT	010	026	But Peter raised him up, saying, I myself also am a man.
044	ACT	010	027	And as he was conversing with him, he went in, and found many assembled together.
044	ACT	010	028	And he said unto them, Ye know how unlawful it is for a man that is a Jew, to associate with or go to the house of one of another nation: but God hath shewn me, that I should not call any man polluted or unclean.
044	ACT	010	029	And therefore I came to you, when I was sent for, without demur. I ask therefore on what account ye sent for me.
044	ACT	010	030	And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting till this hour, and at the ninth hour I was praying in my house, when behold a man stood before me in bright raiment,
044	ACT	010	031	and said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are remembered before God.
044	ACT	010	032	Send therefore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, who is sirnamed Peter, (he lodgeth in the house of one Simon a tanner, by the sea-side,) who when he cometh, will talk with thee.
044	ACT	010	033	Immediately therefore I sent to thee, and thou hast done well that thou art come. And now we are all here present before God, to hear all the things which God hath charged thee with to us.
044	ACT	010	034	Then Peter opened his mouth and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons:
044	ACT	010	035	but in every nation he that feareth Him, and worketh righteousness, is acceptable to Him.
044	ACT	010	036	According to the declaration which He made to the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ, who is Lord of all.
044	ACT	010	037	Ye know the report that was spread through all Judea, having begun from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached: concerning Jesus of Nazareth,
044	ACT	010	038	how God anointed Him with the holy Spirit and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed by the devil: for God was with Him.
044	ACT	010	039	And we are witnesses of all things that He did, both in the country of Judea, and in the city of Jerusalem: whom notwithstanding they put to death, hanging Him on a tree.
044	ACT	010	040	Him God raised up the third day, and gave Him to be seen openly; not to all the people,
044	ACT	010	041	but to witnesses before appointed by God, even to us, who did eat and drink with Him, after He rose from the dead.
044	ACT	010	042	And He commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is He who is appointed by God to be judge of the living and of the dead.
044	ACT	010	043	To Him do all the prophets bear witness, that whosoever believeth on Him shall receive the forgiveness of their sins through his name.
044	ACT	010	044	While Peter was yet speaking these words, the holy Spirit fell upon all them that heard the word.
044	ACT	010	045	And those of the circumcision that were believers, who came with Peter, were astonished, that the gift of the holy Spirit was conferred upon the Gentiles also:
044	ACT	010	046	for they heard them speaking in divers languages, and glorifying God.
044	ACT	010	047	Then said Peter, Can any one forbid water, that these persons should not be baptized, who have received the holy Spirit, as well as we?
044	ACT	010	048	And he ordered them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. And they desired him to stay there some days.
044	ACT	011	001	Now the apostles and brethren that were in Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God.
044	ACT	011	002	And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, those that were of the circumcision contended with him, saying,
044	ACT	011	003	Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised and didst eat with them.
044	ACT	011	004	But Peter began and laid the matter in order before them,
044	ACT	011	005	saying, I was praying in the city of Joppa; and in a trance I saw a vision, some thing like a large sheet descending from heaven, let down by the four corners; and it came close to me.
044	ACT	011	006	And looking stedfastly upon it, I observed four-footed creatures and wild beasts, and reptiles, and fowls of the air.
044	ACT	011	007	And I heard a voice saying to me, Rise, Peter, kill and eat.
044	ACT	011	008	But I said, By no means, Lord: for nothing polluted or unclean hath ever entered into my mouth.
044	ACT	011	009	And the voice answered me a second time from heaven, What God hath cleansed do not thou call polluted.
044	ACT	011	010	And this was done thrice: and then they were all drawn up again to heaven.
044	ACT	011	011	And behold at that very time there came three men to the house where I was, sent from Cesarea to me.
044	ACT	011	012	And the Spirit ordered me to go with them, doubting nothing. And these six brethren also came with me, and we entred into the man's house;
044	ACT	011	013	and he told us how he had seen an angel in his house, standing and saying to him, Send men to Joppa, and fetch hither Simon,
044	ACT	011	014	whose sirname is Peter, who will tell thee things, by which thou shalt be saved and all thy family.
044	ACT	011	015	And when I began to speak, the holy Spirit fell on them, even as it did upon us at the beginning.
044	ACT	011	016	Then I remembered the word of the Lord, how He said, John indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the holy Spirit.
044	ACT	011	017	As therefore God gave to them the like gift that He did to us, upon our believing on the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I, that I should be able to withstand God?
044	ACT	011	018	And when they heard these things they acquiesced, and glorified God, saying, Then hath God given to the Gentiles also repentance unto life.
044	ACT	011	019	Now they that were dispersed by the trouble, which arose about Stephen, travelled as far as Phenicia, and Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the word to none but the Jews only.
044	ACT	011	020	But some of them were Cyprians, and Cyrenians, who when they came to Antioch, discoursed with the Grecians also, preaching the Lord Jesus.
044	ACT	011	021	And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number believed, and turned unto the Lord.
044	ACT	011	022	And the report of these things came to the ears of the church in Jerusalem; and they sent Barnabas to Antioch.
044	ACT	011	023	Who, when he was come, and saw the grace of God, rejoiced, and exhorted them all with steadiness of heart to adhere to the Lord.
044	ACT	011	024	For he was a good man, and full of the holy Spirit, and of faith: and many were added unto the Lord.
044	ACT	011	025	Then Barnabas departed to Tarsus, to seek Saul: and when he found him, he brought him to Antioch.
044	ACT	011	026	And they assembled in the church a whole year, and taught much people: and the disciples were first called Christians at Antioch.
044	ACT	011	027	And in these days came down prophets from Jerusalem to Antioch.
044	ACT	011	028	And one of them, named Agabus, stood up and signified by the Spirit, that there would be a great famine over all the earth: which accordingly came to pass in the reign of Claudius Cesar.
044	ACT	011	029	And each of the disciples, according to his ability, determined to send relief to the brethren who dwelt in Judea.
044	ACT	011	030	Which they also did, sending it to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.
044	ACT	012	001	About that time Herod the king exerted his power to distress some of the church.
044	ACT	012	002	And he cut off James, the brother of John, with the sword.
044	ACT	012	003	And seeing that it was pleasing to the Jews, he proceeded to apprehend Peter also, (in the days of unleavened bread:)
044	ACT	012	004	whom he seized and put into prison, delivering him to four quaternions of soldiers to guard him; intending, after the passover, to bring him out to the people.
044	ACT	012	005	Peter was therefore kept in custody: but incessant prayer was made to God for him by the church.
044	ACT	012	006	And when Herod was about to bring him forth, that very night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the guards at the door watched the prison.
044	ACT	012	007	And behold an angel of the Lord stood by him, and a light shone in the room; and smiting Peter on the side, he waked him, and said, Rise up quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands.
044	ACT	012	008	And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself and tie on thy sandals: and he did so. And he saith unto him, Throw thy garment round thee, and follow me.
044	ACT	012	009	So he went out and followed him; and he did not know, that what was done by the angel was real, but thought he saw a vision.
044	ACT	012	010	And passing through the first and second guard, they came to the iron gate, that leadeth into the city, which of its own accord opened to them: and they went out and passed on through one street; and then the angel departed from him.
044	ACT	012	011	And Peter being come to himself said, Now I know truly, that the Lord hath sent his angel and hath delivered me from the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews.
044	ACT	012	012	And considering with himself, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, who was sirnamed Mark, where many were gathered together and praying.
044	ACT	012	013	And when Peter knocked at the door of the porch, a servant named Rhoda came to ask who was there.
044	ACT	012	014	And knowing Peter's voice, through excess of joy she did not open the door, but ran in and told them, that Peter was standing at the door.
044	ACT	012	015	And they said to her, Thou art mad: but she confidently affirmed that it was so. Then said they, It is his angel.
044	ACT	012	016	But Peter continued knocking; and when they opened the door, they saw him, and were astonished.
044	ACT	012	017	But he made a sign to them with his hand to be silent, and related to them, how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, Go, tell these things to James and to the other brethren. And he departed and went to another place.
044	ACT	012	018	Now as soon as it was day, there was no small disturbance among the soldiers, what was become of Peter.
044	ACT	012	019	And Herod searching for him, and not finding him, brought the keepers to a trial, and ordered them to be executed. Then he went down from Judea to Cesarea, and abode there.
044	ACT	012	020	And Herod was going to make war upon the Tyrians and Sidonians: but they came to him with one consent, and making interest with Blastus the king's chamberlain, they sued for peace; because their territory was supplied with provision by the king's country.
044	ACT	012	021	And upon a set day, Herod arrayed in his royal robes, and sitting upon his throne, made an oration to them.
044	ACT	012	022	And the people gave a shout, saying, It is the voice of a god, and not of a man:
044	ACT	012	023	but immediately an angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not God the glory: and being devoured by worms he died.
044	ACT	012	024	But the word of God grew and was multiplied.
044	ACT	012	025	And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled their charge, taking along with them John who was sirnamed Mark.
044	ACT	013	001	Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers, as Barnabas, and Simeon called Niger, and Lucius the Cyrenean, and Manaen who had been educated with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul;
044	ACT	013	002	and as they were ministring to the Lord, and fasting, the holy Spirit said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul, for the work to which I have called them.
044	ACT	013	003	Then having fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them they sent them away.
044	ACT	013	004	These therefore being sent forth by the holy Spirit came down to Seleucia, and from thence they sailed away to Cyprus.
044	ACT	013	005	And when they arrived at Salamis, they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John for their assistant.
044	ACT	013	006	And going quite through the island even to Paphos, they found there a certain magician, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Barjesus.
044	ACT	013	007	Who was with the proconsul Sergius Paulus, an understanding man: who calling for Barnabas and Saul, desired to hear the word of God.
044	ACT	013	008	But Elymas the magician (for so his name signifies) withstood them endeavouring to turn away the proconsul from the faith.
044	ACT	013	009	Then Saul, who also is called Paul, being filled with the holy Spirit, and looking earnestly at him,
044	ACT	013	010	said, O thou son of the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, who art full of all deceit and craft, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?
044	ACT	013	011	And now behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing even the sun for a time. And immediately there fell upon him a mist and darkness; and groping about he sought for somebody to lead him by the hand.
044	ACT	013	012	Then the proconsul, seeing what was done, believed, being struck with admiration at the doctrine of the Lord.
044	ACT	013	013	Now Paul and those that were with him loosing from Paphos, came to Perga in Pamphylia: but John departed from them and returned to Jerusalem.
044	ACT	013	014	And they passing on from Perga came to Antioch in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the sabbath-day, and sat down.
044	ACT	013	015	And after the reading of the law and the prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them, saying, Brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation to the people, deliver it.
044	ACT	013	016	Then Paul stood up, and made a sign with his hand, and said, Men of Israel, and ye that fear God, give audience.
044	ACT	013	017	---The God of this people Israel chose our fathers, and raised the people, while they sojourned in the land of Egypt, and with mighty power brought them out of it.
044	ACT	013	018	And about forty years He bare with their behaviour in the wilderness.
044	ACT	013	019	And destroying seven nations in the land of Canaan, He gave them their country for an inheritance.
044	ACT	013	020	And after these things, about the space of four hundred and fifty years, He gave them judges till Samuel the prophet.
044	ACT	013	021	And then they desired a king: and God gave them Saul the Son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for the space of forty years.
044	ACT	013	022	And having removed him, He raised up David for their king, to whom also He gave testimony and said, I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after my own heart, who will perform all my will.
044	ACT	013	023	Of this man's seed, according to the promise, hath God raised up to Israel Jesus the Saviour:
044	ACT	013	024	John having preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.
044	ACT	013	025	And as John was fulfilling his course, he said, Whom do ye take me to be? I am not He: but behold there cometh one after me, the shoes of whose feet I am not worthy to unloose.
044	ACT	013	026	---Men and brethren, children of the race of Abraham, and all those among you that fear God, to you is the word of this salvation sent.
044	ACT	013	027	For the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and their rulers, not knowing Him, have indeed fulfilled the words of the prophets, which are read every sabbath-day, in condemning Him.
044	ACT	013	028	And though they found in Him no capital offence, yet they desired of Pilate that He might be put to death.
044	ACT	013	029	And when they had finished all things that were written concerning Him, they took Him down from the cross and laid Him in a tomb.
044	ACT	013	030	But God raised Him from the dead:
044	ACT	013	031	and He was seen for many days by those that came up with Him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses to the people.
044	ACT	013	032	And we bring you good tidings,
044	ACT	013	033	that the promise made unto the fathers God hath fulfilled unto us their children, having raised up Jesus again: as it is also written in the second psalm, "Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee."
044	ACT	013	034	And that He raised Him from the dead, no more to return to the place of corruption, He hath said thus, "I will give you the sure mercies of David."
044	ACT	013	035	Wherefore he saith also in another place, Thou wilt not suffer thine holy One to see corruption.
044	ACT	013	036	Now David having served his own generation according to the will of God, fell asleep, and was laid with his fathers, and saw corruption: but He whom God raised,
044	ACT	013	037	did not see corruption.
044	ACT	013	038	Be it known therefore unto you, brethren, that through Him is preached unto you the remission of sins:
044	ACT	013	039	and by Him every one that believeth is justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses.
044	ACT	013	040	Beware therefore, least what is spoken in the prophets come upon you,
044	ACT	013	041	"Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and vanish; for I do a work in your days, which ye will not believe, though any one should declare it unto you."
044	ACT	013	042	As they went out of the synagogue of the Jews, the Gentiles desired that these words might be spoken to them on the following sabbath.
044	ACT	013	043	And when the synagogue was broken up, many of the Jews and of the devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas; who addressing themselves to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God.
044	ACT	013	044	And on the next sabbath almost all the city came together to hear the word of God.
044	ACT	013	045	But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy, and contradicted the things which were spoken by Paul, opposing and reviling him.
044	ACT	013	046	Then Paul and Barnabas boldly said, It was necessary that the word of God should be first spoken to you; but since ye reject it, and judge not yourselves worthy of eternal life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles:
044	ACT	013	047	for so the Lord hath commanded us, saying, "I have appointed thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for salvation to the utmost part of the earth."
044	ACT	013	048	And when the Gentiles heard this, they rejoiced and glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were determined for eternal life believed.
044	ACT	013	049	And the word of the Lord was spread through the whole country:
044	ACT	013	050	but the Jews stirred up devout and honorable women, and the heads of the city, and raised a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and drove them out of their territories.
044	ACT	013	051	But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came to Iconium.
044	ACT	013	052	And the disciples were filled with joy, and with the holy Spirit.
044	ACT	014	001	And at Iconium they went both together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spake, that a great number both of the Jews and of the Greeks believed.
044	ACT	014	002	But the unbelieving Jews stirred up and inflamed the minds of the Gentiles against the brethren.
044	ACT	014	003	They therefore stayed a considerable time speaking freely of the Lord, who bare witness to the word of his grace, and gave signs and wonders to be done by their hands.
044	ACT	014	004	But the multitude of the city was divided: and some were for the Jews, and some for the apostles:
044	ACT	014	005	but when there was an effort both of the Gentiles and of the Jews, together with their rulers, to offer violence to them, and to stone them;
044	ACT	014	006	being apprised of it they fled to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra and Derbe, and the adjacent country:
044	ACT	014	007	and there they preached the gospel.
044	ACT	014	008	And there was sitting at Lystra, a man disabled in his feet, who had never walked at all, being lame from his birth.
044	ACT	014	009	This man heard Paul speaking; who looking earnestly at him, and perceiving that he had faith to be healed,
044	ACT	014	010	said with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet. And he leaped up, and walked.
044	ACT	014	011	And the people, seeing what Paul had done, lifted up their voice, saying in the Lycaonian tongue, The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men.
044	ACT	014	012	And they called Barnabas Jupiter, and Paul Mercury; because he was the chief speaker.
044	ACT	014	013	And the priest of Jupiter, whose image was before the city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates, and with the people would have offered sacrifices to them.
044	ACT	014	014	But the apostles Barnabas and Paul, when they heard of it, rent their clothes, and ran in among the people,
044	ACT	014	015	crying out, and saying, "Sirs, why do ye these things? we also are men subject to the like infirmities with you, and we preach the gospel unto you, that ye may turn from these vanities to the living God, who made the heaven, and the earth, and the sea,
044	ACT	014	016	and all things therein, who in generations past suffered all the nations to walk in their own ways: though He left not Himself without witness;
044	ACT	014	017	for He did us good, in giving us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness."
044	ACT	014	018	And saying these things, they with difficulty restrained the people from sacrificing to them.
044	ACT	014	019	But there came thither some Jews from Antioch and Iconium, and persuading the multitude, stoned Paul, and dragged him out of the city, supposing him to be dead.
044	ACT	014	020	But when the disciples were gathered round him, he rose up and came into the city: and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe.
044	ACT	014	021	And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and made many disciples, they returned to Lystra, and Iconium, and Antioch;
044	ACT	014	022	confirming the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to continue in the faith, and telling them that through many afflictions we must enter into the kingdom of God.
044	ACT	014	023	And when they had appointed them elders in every church, praying and fasting, they recommended them to the Lord, in whom they had believed.
044	ACT	014	024	And passing through Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia.
044	ACT	014	025	And when they had preached the word at Perga, they went down to Attalia.
044	ACT	014	026	And from thence they sailed to Antioch, from whence they had been recommended to the grace of God, for the work which they had now fulfilled.
044	ACT	014	027	And when they were come, and had gathered the church together, they related what God had done by them, and how he had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles.
044	ACT	014	028	And they spent a considerable time there with the disciples.
044	ACT	015	001	Now some that came down from Judea, taught the brethren, saying, Except ye be circumcised according to the law of Moses, ye cannot be saved.
044	ACT	015	002	A dissension therefore arising, and Paul and Barnabas having no small dispute with them, it was resolved that Paul and Barnabas, and some others, should go up to the apostles and elders at Jerusalem about this question.
044	ACT	015	003	They therefore, being brought forward on their way by the church, passed through Phenicia and Samaria, relating the conversion of the Gentiles: and they gave great joy to all the brethren.
044	ACT	015	004	And when they came to Jerusalem, they were received by the church, and by the apostles and elders, and they told them all that God had done by them.
044	ACT	015	005	But there rose up, said they, some of the sect of the pharisees that believed, saying, that it was necessary to circumcise them, and enjoin them to keep the law of Moses.
044	ACT	015	006	So the apostles and elders were assembled together to consider about this matter.
044	ACT	015	007	And after much debate, Peter rose up, and said unto them, Brethren, ye know that a good while ago, God, who was among us, chose that the Gentiles should hear by my mouth the word of the gospel, and believe.
044	ACT	015	008	And God who knoweth the heart, bare witness to them, giving them the holy Spirit, as He had done also to us:
044	ACT	015	009	and made no difference between us and them, having purified their hearts by faith.
044	ACT	015	010	Now therefore why do ye tempt God, in imposing a yoke on the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?
044	ACT	015	011	But we believe that we shall be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, in like manner as they.
044	ACT	015	012	And all the multitude kept silence, and gave attention to Barnabas and Paul, relating what signs and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them.
044	ACT	015	013	And after they had done speaking, James rose up and said, Brethren, hearken unto me.
044	ACT	015	014	---Simeon hath related, how God at first condescended to take out of the Gentiles a people to his name.
044	ACT	015	015	And to this agree the words of the prophets,
044	ACT	015	016	as it is written, "After this will I return, and rebuild the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; and I will repair its ruins, and set it up again.
044	ACT	015	017	That the rest of mankind may seek the Lord, even all the nations, upon whom my name is called, saith the Lord who doth all these things."
044	ACT	015	018	Now all his works are known unto God from the beginning of the world:
044	ACT	015	019	wherefore my advice is, not to trouble those who from among the Gentiles are converted to God; but to write to them,
044	ACT	015	020	that they abstain from the pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from what is strangled, and from blood.
044	ACT	015	021	For Moses hath had from ancient times those that preach him in every city, and is still read in the synagogues every sabbath-day.
044	ACT	015	022	Then it seemed good to the apostles, and elders, and the whole church, to send men chose from among themselves to Antioch along with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas sirnamed Barsabas, and Silas; leading men among the brethren:
044	ACT	015	023	and they wrote by their hand, as follows, The apostles and elders and brethren here to the Gentile brethren which are in Antioch, and Syria, and Cilicia, send greeting.
044	ACT	015	024	Forasmuch as we have heard, that some who went out from us, have troubled you by their discourses, unsettling your minds, saying, ye must be circumcised, and keep the law; to whom we gave no such commission;
044	ACT	015	025	it seemed good to us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men unto you, with our beloved brethren Barnabas and Paul,
044	ACT	015	026	who have exposed their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
044	ACT	015	027	We have therefore sent with them Judas and Silas, to tell you the same things also by word of mouth.
044	ACT	015	028	For it seemed good to the holy Spirit, and so to us, to lay no more burthen upon you than these necessary things.
044	ACT	015	029	That ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from what has been strangled, and from fornication: from which ye will do well to keep yourselves. Farewel.
044	ACT	015	030	Being thus dispatched they came to Antioch, and when they had assembled the brethren, they delivered the epistle.
044	ACT	015	031	And when they had read it, they rejoiced at the consolation it brought.
044	ACT	015	032	And Judas and Silas being prophets also themselves, exhorted and established: the brethren by many discourses.
044	ACT	015	033	And after some time, they were dismissed with peace from the brethren to the apostles.
044	ACT	015	034	But it seemed good to Silas to continue there: Paul also and Barnabas stayed at Antioch,
044	ACT	015	035	teaching and preaching, with many others likewise, the word of the Lord.
044	ACT	015	036	And after some days Paul said to Barnabas, Let us return and visit our brethren in every city, where we have preached the word of the Lord, and see how they are.
044	ACT	015	037	And Barnabas proposed to take with them John, who was surnamed Mark.
044	ACT	015	038	But Paul did not think proper to take him with them, who left them in Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.
044	ACT	015	039	And there was a sharp dispute, so that they separated from each other; and Barnabas took Mark and sailed to Cyprus: but Paul chose Silas and departed,
044	ACT	015	040	being recommended to the grace of God.
044	ACT	015	041	And he went through Syria and Cilicia confirming the churches.
044	ACT	016	001	Then he came to Derbe and Lystra: and behold there was a certain disciple there, named Timothy, the son of a believing Jewess, but of a Grecian father.
044	ACT	016	002	Who was well spoken of by the brethren at Lystra and Iconium:
044	ACT	016	003	wherefore Paul was desirous that he should go forth with him, and took and circumcised him because of the Jews that were in those parts; for they all knew that his father was a Greek.
044	ACT	016	004	And as they passed through the cities, they delivered to them the decrees that had been made by the apostles and elders at Jerusalem.
044	ACT	016	005	And so the churches were established in the faith, and increased in number daily.
044	ACT	016	006	And when they had passed through Phrygia and Galatia, being forbidden by the holy Spirit to preach the word in Asia, they came to Mysia, and endeavoured to go to Bithynia:
044	ACT	016	007	but the Spirit suffered them not.
044	ACT	016	008	So they passed by Mysia, and came down to Troas.
044	ACT	016	009	And Paul saw a vision in the night, There stood a certain man of Macedonia, intreating him and saying, Come over into Macedonia and help us.
044	ACT	016	010	And as soon as he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavoured to depart into Macedonia, concluding that the Lord called us to preach the gospel to them.
044	ACT	016	011	Therefore we set sail from Troas, and came in a direct course to Samothracia, and the day following to Neapolis;
044	ACT	016	012	and from thence to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, and a Roman colony. And we staid some time in this city.
044	ACT	016	013	And on the sabbath-day we went out of the city to a river-side, where there used to be prayer: and we sat down and preached to the women that resorted thither.
044	ACT	016	014	And a certain woman named Lydia, a purple-seller of the city of Thyatira, who worshipped God, heard us: whose heart the Lord opened to attend to the things that were spoken by Paul.
044	ACT	016	015	And when she was baptized and her family, she requested us, saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and lodge there. And she constrained us.
044	ACT	016	016	Now as we were going to the place of prayer, there met us a young woman that had a spirit of divination, who brought her masters much gain by soothsaying.
044	ACT	016	017	She following Paul and us, cried out, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, who shew us the way of salvation.
044	ACT	016	018	And this she did for many days. But Paul being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her.
044	ACT	016	019	And he came out that instant. And when her masters saw, that the hope of their gain was gone, they seized on Paul and Silas, and dragged them into the court to the magistrates.
044	ACT	016	020	And when they brought them to the governors, they said, These men cause great disturbance in our city, for they are Jews, and teach customs,
044	ACT	016	021	which it is not lawful for us to receive, nor practise, who are Romans.
044	ACT	016	022	And the populace rose up together against them: and the officers stripped off their clothes, and ordered them to be scourged.
044	ACT	016	023	And when they had given them many stripes, they cast them into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely.
044	ACT	016	024	Who having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks.
044	ACT	016	025	Now in the middle of the night Paul and Silas were praying and singing praises to God, and the prisoners heard them.
044	ACT	016	026	And on a sudden there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one's bonds were loosed.
044	ACT	016	027	The jailor waking, and seeing the prison-doors open, drew his sword and was going to kill himself, thinking that the prisoners were fled.
044	ACT	016	028	But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we are all here.
044	ACT	016	029	Then he called for lights, and sprang in, and being in a tremor fell down before Paul and Silas:
044	ACT	016	030	and bringing them out, he said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?
044	ACT	016	031	And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thine house.
044	ACT	016	032	And they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all in his family.
044	ACT	016	033	And he took them at that very time of the night, and bathed their stripes: and was baptized, he and all his immediately after.
044	ACT	016	034	And he brought them into his house, and spread a table for them, and rejoiced, believing in God with all his household.
044	ACT	016	035	And when it was the day the governors sent the serjeants, saying, Let those men go.
044	ACT	016	036	And the jailor told these words to Paul, saying, the governors have sent orders, that you should be discharged; now therefore depart, and go in peace.
044	ACT	016	037	But Paul said unto them, They have publicly beaten us, uncondemned, and Romans, and cast us into prison, and do they now turn us out privately? No verily, let them come themselves and fetch us out.
044	ACT	016	038	And the serjeants reported these words to the governors: and they were afraid when they heard that they were Romans.
044	ACT	016	039	And they came and intreated them, and when they had brought them out, they desired them to leave the city.
044	ACT	016	040	And when they were come out of the prison, they went into the house of Lydia: and seeing the brethren, they comforted them, and departed.
044	ACT	017	001	Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews.
044	ACT	017	002	And according to his custom Paul went in among them, and for three sabbath-days discoursed to them from the scriptures;
044	ACT	017	003	opening them and shewing, that the Messiah was to suffer and rise again from the dead: and that this is the Christ even, Jesus, whom, said he, I preach unto you.
044	ACT	017	004	And some of them believed and joined themselves to Paul and Silas, and a great number of the devout Greeks, and of the women of distinction not a few.
044	ACT	017	005	But the unbelieving Jews being filled with envy, collected some loose profligate fellows, and making a tumult set all the city in an uproar: and assaulting Jason's house, they sought for them in order to bring them out to the populace.
044	ACT	017	006	But not finding them, they dragged Jason and some of the brethren to the rulers of the city, crying out, these men that have turned the world upside down,
044	ACT	017	007	are come hither also, and Jason has privately received them. And they all act contrary to the decrees of Cesar, saying, there is another king, one Jesus.
044	ACT	017	008	And they alarmed the people, and the rulers of the city upon hearing these things:
044	ACT	017	009	but they taking security of Jason and the rest, let them go.
044	ACT	017	010	And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night to Berea: who, when they were come thither, went into the synagogue of the Jews.
044	ACT	017	011	These were more ingenuous than those at Thessalonica; for they received the word with all readiness of mind, searching the scriptures daily, whether these things were so.
044	ACT	017	012	And therefore many of them believed: and of the Grecian women of quality, and of men likewise not a few.
044	ACT	017	013	But when the Jews of Thessalonica knew that the word of God was preached by Paul at Berea, they came thither also, to stir up the people.
044	ACT	017	014	Then the brethren immediately sent away Paul towards the sea: but Silas and Timothy remained there.
044	ACT	017	015	And they that conducted Paul attended him to Athens: and receiving an order to Silas and Timothy, to come to him as soon as possible, they departed.
044	ACT	017	016	Now while Paul was waiting for them at Athens, his Spirit was greatly moved, when he saw the city wholly given up to idolatry.
044	ACT	017	017	He therefore disputed in the synagogue with the Jews and other devout persons on the sabbath-day, and with whomsoever he met in public every day.
044	ACT	017	018	But some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers encountered him; and some said, What would this babler say? and others, He seemeth to be a proclaimer of foreign deities: because he preached to them Jesus and the resurrection.
044	ACT	017	019	And they took and brought him to the Areopagus, and said, May we know what this new doctrine is, of which thou speakest?
044	ACT	017	020	For thou bringest strange things to our ears; we would therefore know what these things mean.
044	ACT	017	021	(Now all the Athenians, and strangers sojourning among them, spent their time in nothing else, but to tell or to hear something new.)
044	ACT	017	022	Then Paul stood up in the midst of the Areopagus and said, Ye men of Athens, I perceive that you are indeed over-much religious:
044	ACT	017	023	for as I was passing along, and looking at what ye worshipped, I found an altar on which there was inscribed, "To the unknown God." Whom therefore ye worship unknown, Him do I declare unto you.
044	ACT	017	024	The God that made the world and all things therein, being lord of heaven and earth dwelleth not in temples made with hands:
044	ACT	017	025	nor is He served by the hands of men, as needing any thing: for He giveth to all life, and breath, and all things;
044	ACT	017	026	and hath made of one blood every nation of men to dwell upon all the face of the earth, having determined the seasons before-appointed them, and the bounds of their habitation;
044	ACT	017	027	that they might seek the Lord, if possibly they might trace Him, and find Him: though indeed He is not far from every one of us.
044	ACT	017	028	For in Him we live and move, and exist; as some also of your own poets have said, "For we his offspring are."
044	ACT	017	029	Being then the offspring of God, we ought not to imagine that the Deity is like to gold, or silver, or stone, carved by the art and device of man.
044	ACT	017	030	Wherefore though God overlooked the times of this ignorance, He now requireth all men every where to repent.
044	ACT	017	031	Because He hath fixed a day, in which He will judge the world in righteousness, by that man whom He hath appointed thereto; having given assurance of it to all men, by raising Him from the dead.
044	ACT	017	032	And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some laughed at it: and others said, We will hear thee again concerning this matter.
044	ACT	017	033	So Paul went out of the assembly.
044	ACT	017	034	Some however adhered to him, and believed: among whom was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.
044	ACT	018	001	After these things Paul departed from Athens and came to Corinth.
044	ACT	018	002	And finding there a certain Jew, named Aquila, a native of Pontus, who was lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla, (because Claudius Cesar had ordered all the Jews to depart from Rome,) he went to them;
044	ACT	018	003	and as he was of the same trade, he staid and worked with them: for they were tent-makers.
044	ACT	018	004	And he discoursed in the synagogue every sabbath-day, and persuaded both Jews and Greeks.
044	ACT	018	005	And when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was very urgent in spirit, testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Messiah.
044	ACT	018	006	But as they opposed and blasphemed, he shook his garment, and said unto them, Your blood be upon your own heads; I am clear of it: from henceforth I will go to the Gentiles.
044	ACT	018	007	And departing thence, he went to the house of one named Justus, who worshipped God, whose house was contiguous to the synagogue.
044	ACT	018	008	But Crispus the ruler of the synagogue believed on the Lord with all his house: and many of the Corinthians hearing the word believed, and were baptized.
044	ACT	018	009	And the Lord said to Paul by a vision in the night, "Fear not, but speak: and be not silent:
044	ACT	018	010	for I am with thee, and no man shall lay hands on thee to hurt thee; for I have much people in this city."
044	ACT	018	011	And he staid a year and six months, teaching among them the word of God.
044	ACT	018	012	But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one accord rose against Paul, and brought him to the seat of justice,
044	ACT	018	013	saying, this fellow persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law.
044	ACT	018	014	And when Paul was going to speak, Gallio said to the Jews, If it were indeed an act of injustice, or some wicked crime, it would be reasonable that I should bear with you.
044	ACT	018	015	But if it be a question about words, and names, and your law, settle it yourselves; for I will be no judge of these matters.
044	ACT	018	016	And he ordered them away from the tribunal.
044	ACT	018	017	Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him even before the tribunal: but Gallio did not concern himself about the matter.
044	ACT	018	018	And after Paul had staid there yet a considerable time, he took leave of the brethren, and sailed from thence to Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila, after he had shaved his head at Cenchrea; for he had a vow.
044	ACT	018	019	And he came to Esphesus, and left them there: but before his departure he himself went into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.
044	ACT	018	020	Though when they desired him to stay longer with them, he did not consent: but took his leave of them,
044	ACT	018	021	saying, I must by all means keep the approaching feast at Jerusalem; but I will return to you again, God willing. So he sailed from Ephesus;
044	ACT	018	022	and landing at Cesarea, went up to Jerusalem, and after he had saluted the church, he went down to Antioch.
044	ACT	018	023	And when he had spent some time there, he departed, and went in order through the country of Galatia and Phrygia strengthening all the disciples.
044	ACT	018	024	Now there came to Ephesus a certain Jew named Apollos, an Alexandrian by birth, an eloquent man, and mighty in the scriptures.
044	ACT	018	025	Who had been instructed in the way of our Lord; and being fervent in spirit, he spake and taught clearly the things of the Lord, though he knew only the baptism of John.
044	ACT	018	026	And as he began to speak openly in the synagogue, Aquila and Priscilla heard him and took him home, and expounded to him the way of God more perfectly.
044	ACT	018	027	And as he was inclined to go into Achaia, the brethren wrote to the disciples exhorting them to receive him: who when he arrived, was very helpful to those who had believed through grace.
044	ACT	018	028	For he disputed vehemently with the Jews in public, proving by the scriptures, that Jesus was the Christ.
044	ACT	019	001	Now it came to pass while Apollos was at Corinth, that Paul having passed through the upper parts of Asia came to Ephesus:
044	ACT	019	002	and finding some disciples there, he said unto them, Have ye received the holy Spirit since ye embraced the faith? And they said unto him, Nay, we had not even heard whether the holy Spirit be yet given.
044	ACT	019	003	And he said unto them, Into what then were ye baptized? And they said, Into the baptism of John.
044	ACT	019	004	Then said Paul, John indeed baptized with the baptism of repentance, telling the people, that they should believe in Him that was coming after him, that is, in Christ Jesus.
044	ACT	019	005	And when they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
044	ACT	019	006	And as Paul laid his hands on them, the holy Spirit came upon them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied. And the men were in all about twelve.
044	ACT	019	007	And he went into the synagogue,
044	ACT	019	008	and spake boldly, disputing with them for the space of three months, and persuading them of the things concerning the kingdom of God.
044	ACT	019	009	But as some were hardened and refractory, speaking evil of the way of life before the multitude, he departed from them, and took away the disciples with him, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.
044	ACT	019	010	And this he did for two years; so that all the inhabitants of Asia, both Jews and Greeks, heard the word of the Lord Jesus.
044	ACT	019	011	And God wrought extraordinary miracles by the hands of Paul:
044	ACT	019	012	so that even handkerchiefs or aprons were brought from his body to the sick, and the diseases lest them, and evil spirits went out of them.
044	ACT	019	013	Then some of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them to name the name of the Lord Jesus over those that had evil spirits, saying, "We adjure you by Jesus, whom Paul preacheth."
044	ACT	019	014	Now there were seven sons of one Sceva a Jewish priest, who did this.
044	ACT	019	015	But the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know, but who are ye?
044	ACT	019	016	And the man in whom the evil spirit was, leapt upon them, and mastered them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.
044	ACT	019	017	And this became known to all, both Jews and Greeks, that dwelt at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.
044	ACT	019	018	And many of them that believed came confessing and declaring their former practices.
044	ACT	019	019	And a great number of those that had used inquisitive arts, brought the books, and burned them before them all: and they computed the price of them, and found it to be fifty thousand pieces of silver.
044	ACT	019	020	So mightily did the word of the Lord increase and prevail.
044	ACT	019	021	After these things, Paul purposed in spirit to pass through Macedonia and Achaia, and go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.
044	ACT	019	022	So he sent into Macedonia two of those that ministred to him, Timothy and Erastus, but he himself stayed some time in Asia.
044	ACT	019	023	Now there happened at that time no small disturbance about the way which he taught.
044	ACT	019	024	For one Demetrius, a silver-smith, who made silver models of Diana's temple, brought no small gain to the artificers: whom he got together,
044	ACT	019	025	and with them the workmen they employed about such things, and said, My friends, ye know that by this employment we get our wealth.
044	ACT	019	026	And ye see and hear, that not only at Ephesus, but in almost all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and perverted many people, saying, that they are no gods which are made by hands.
044	ACT	019	027	So that we are not only in danger of this, that the business we follow will come to nothing; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana will be despised; and her magnificence destroyed, whom all Asia and the whole world worshippeth.
044	ACT	019	028	Hearing this and being filled with rage, they cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.
044	ACT	019	029	And the whole city was filled with confusion: and they rushed with one accord into the theatre, dragging with them Gaius and Aristarchus two Macedonians, fellow-travellers with Paul.
044	ACT	019	030	And when Paul would have gone in unto the people, the disciples would not let him.
044	ACT	019	031	And some also of the chief men of Asia, being his friends, sent to him and desired him not to venture himself into the theatre.
044	ACT	019	032	Some therefore cried one thing, and some another; for the assembly was confused, and the greater part did not know for what they were come together.
044	ACT	019	033	And they brought Alexander forward out of the multitude, the Jews urging him on. And Alexander beckoning with the hand, would have made a defence to the people.
044	ACT	019	034	But when they knew that he was a Jew, they all cried out with one voice, for near two hours, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.
044	ACT	019	035	And when the Secretary had appeased the multitude, he said, Ye men of Ephesus, what man is there who doth not know that the city of the Ephesians is devoted to the service of the great goddess Diana, and of the image which fell down from Jupiter?
044	ACT	019	036	Since therefore these things are incontestible, ye ought to be quiet and composed, and to do nothing rashly.
044	ACT	019	037	For ye have brought these men hither, who are neither robbers of temples, nor blasphemers of your goddess.
044	ACT	019	038	If Demetrius therefore, and the artificers that are with him, have a charge against any one, the law-courts are open, and there are Roman proconsuls likewise: let them implead one another.
044	ACT	019	039	But if ye are enquiring any thing about other matters, let it be decided in a lawful assembly:
044	ACT	019	040	for we are in danger of being charged with sedition for what has happened this day, there being no cause by which we can give a reason for this concourse.
044	ACT	019	041	And when he had said these things, he dismissed the assembly.
044	ACT	020	001	And after the tumult was over, Paul sent for the disciples to him, and having embraced them, departed to go into Macedonia.
044	ACT	020	002	And having passed through those parts, and given them much exhortation, he came into Greece.
044	ACT	020	003	And when he had spent three months there, the Jews having laid wait for him as he was going to embark for Syria, he determined to return by Macedonia.
044	ACT	020	004	And there accompanied him to Asia, Sopater the Berean, and of the Thessalonians Aristarchus and Secundus, and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy: and the Asiatics,
044	ACT	020	005	Tychicus and Trophimus, who went before and stayed for us at Troas.
044	ACT	020	006	And after the days of unleavened bread we sailed from Philippi, and came to them at Troas in five days, where we spent seven days.
044	ACT	020	007	And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples were assembled together to break bread, Paul being about to depart on the morrow, preached unto them, and continued his discourse till midnight.
044	ACT	020	008	And there were many lamps in the upper room where they were assembled.
044	ACT	020	009	And a young man named Eutychus, who sat in a window, falling into a deep sleep, as Paul was discoursing for a long time, sunk down and fell from the third story, and was taken up dead.
044	ACT	020	010	And Paul went down and leaned over him, and took him up and said, Be not disturbed; for his life is in him.
044	ACT	020	011	Then he went up again, and having broken bread and eaten, and conversed with them a considerable time, even till break of day, he departed.
044	ACT	020	012	And they brought in the young man alive, and were not a little comforted.
044	ACT	020	013	But we went before to the ship, and sailed to Assos, being there to take in Paul: for so he had appointed, designing himself to go on foot.
044	ACT	020	014	And as soon as he joined us at Assos, we took him in and came to Mitylene.
044	ACT	020	015	And sailing from thence we came the next day over against Chios; and the day following we arrived at Samos, and stopping at Trogyllium, we came the day after to Miletus.
044	ACT	020	016	For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, that he might not spend time in Asia: for he endeavoured, if it were possible, to be at Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost.
044	ACT	020	017	But he sent from Miletus to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church.
044	ACT	020	018	And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye know in what manner I behaved among you all the time, from the first day that I came into Asia.
044	ACT	020	019	Serving the Lord with all humility, and many tears, and trials which befel me by the ambushes of the Jews.
044	ACT	020	020	And how I with-held nothing that was useful, but have declared it to you, and have taught you publicly and from house to house:
044	ACT	020	021	testifying both to the Jews and Greeks, repentance towards God, and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.
044	ACT	020	022	And now, being constrained by the spirit, behold I am going to Jerusalem, not knowing what will befal me there:
044	ACT	020	023	save that the holy Spirit testifieth in every city, that bonds and afflictions await me.
044	ACT	020	024	But none of these things move me, nor do I account my life dear, so that I may finish my course with joy, and the ministry which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.
044	ACT	020	025	And now behold I know that ye all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more.
044	ACT	020	026	Wherefore I call you to witness this day, that I am clear from the blood of all men.
044	ACT	020	027	For I have not failed to declare unto you all the counsel of God.
044	ACT	020	028	Take heed therefore to yourselves, and to all the flock, in which the holy Spirit hath appointed you bishops, to feed the church of God, which He purchased with his own blood.
044	ACT	020	029	For I know this, that after my departure grievous wolves will enter in among you, not sparing the flock.
044	ACT	020	030	And from among yourselves shall men arise, speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them.
044	ACT	020	031	Watch therefore, remembering that for the space of three years I ceased not by night and by day to warn every one with tears.
044	ACT	020	032	And now, my brethren, I recommend you to God, and to the word of his grace: who is able to edify you, and to give you an inheritance among all that are sanctified.
044	ACT	020	033	I have coveted no one's silver, or gold, or apparel:
044	ACT	020	034	and ye yourselves know that these hands have ministred to my necessities, and to those that were with me.
044	ACT	020	035	I have shewed you in all things, that by labouring thus ye ought to support the infirm; and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, who said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.
044	ACT	020	036	And when he had said these things, he kneeled down, and prayed with them all.
044	ACT	020	037	And they were all much grieved, and fell on Paul's neck, and kissed him: sorrowing most of all at the word which he spake,
044	ACT	020	038	that they should see his face no more. And they accompanied him to the ship.
044	ACT	021	001	Now as soon as we had parted from them, and set sail, we came in a strait course to Coos, and the day following to Rhodes, and from thence to Patara.
044	ACT	021	002	And finding a ship there, which was passing over to Phenicia, we went aboard it, and set sail.
044	ACT	021	003	And coming in fight of Cyprus, we left it on the left hand, and sailed to Syria, and came down to Tyre: for there the ship was to unlade.
044	ACT	021	004	And we stayed there seven days; having met with some disciples: who told Paul by the Spirit, not to go up to Jerusalem.
044	ACT	021	005	But when we had completed these days, we departed and went our way, all of them attending us with their wives and children, till we were out of the city: and we kneeled down on the shore and prayed.
044	ACT	021	006	And having taken leave of each other, we went into the ship, and they returned home.
044	ACT	021	007	And we finishing our voyage, came down from Tyre to Ptolemais, and saluting the brethren stayed with them one day.
044	ACT	021	008	On the morrow Paul and those that were with him departed from Ptolemais, and came to Cesarea; and entering into the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven deacons, we stayed with him.
044	ACT	021	009	And he had four daughters virgins, that were prophetesses.
044	ACT	021	010	And as we abode there several days, there came down from Judea a certain prophet named Agabus:
044	ACT	021	011	and he came to us, and taking up Paul's girdle, and binding his own hands and feet, he said, Thus saith the holy Spirit, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man whose girdle this is, and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.
044	ACT	021	012	And when we heard these things, both we and those of the place intreated him not to go up to Jerusalem.
044	ACT	021	013	But Paul answered, What do ye mean, weeping and breaking my heart? for I am ready not only to be bound, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.
044	ACT	021	014	And as he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done.
044	ACT	021	015	And after these days were expired, we packed up our things, and went to Jerusalem.
044	ACT	021	016	And there went also with us from Cesarea some of the disciples, who brought us to one Mnason a Cyprian, an old disciple, with whom we were to lodge.
044	ACT	021	017	And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us with joy.
044	ACT	021	018	And the next day Paul went in with us to James: and all the elders were present.
044	ACT	021	019	And when he had saluted them, he gave a particular narrative of the things which God had done among the Gentiles by his ministry.
044	ACT	021	020	And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord, and said to him, Thou seest, brother, how many myriads there are of the believing Jews, and they are all zealous for the law.
044	ACT	021	021	And they have heard of thee, that thou teachest all the Jews, who are among the Gentiles, to forsake the law of Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children, nor to walk after our customs.
044	ACT	021	022	What then is to be done? The people must necessarily meet together; for they will hear that thou art come.
044	ACT	021	023	Do this therefore, which we advise thee. Here are four men with us, that have a vow upon them: take these and be purified with them,
044	ACT	021	024	and join in their expences, that they may shave their head: and that all may know, that there is nothing in what they have heard of thee; but thou thyself walkest according to the law.
044	ACT	021	025	But as to the believing Gentiles, we have written and determined, that they need observe no such thing; only to keep themselves from what is offered to idols, and from blood, and from any thing strangled, and from fornication.
044	ACT	021	026	Then Paul took the men, and the next day being purified with them entered into the temple to signify the accomplishment of the days of purification till an offering should be offered for every one of them.
044	ACT	021	027	But when the seven days were near ended, the Jews that came from Asia seeing him in the temple, raised a tumult among the people, and laid hands on him, crying out, Men of Israel, help:
044	ACT	021	028	this is the man that teaches all men every where against the people of the Jews, and the law, and this sacred place? and besides, hath brought Greeks too into the temple, and polluted this holy place.
044	ACT	021	029	(For they had before seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with him, whom they thought Paul had brought into the temple.)
044	ACT	021	030	And the whole city was moved, and there was a concourse of the people: and they laid hold on Paul, and dragged him out of the temple; and immediately the gates were shut.
044	ACT	021	031	And as they were going to kill him, a report came to the tribune of the cohort, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar:
044	ACT	021	032	who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down to them. And when they saw the chiliarch and the soldiers, they left off beating Paul.
044	ACT	021	033	Then the commanding officer came near and took him, and ordered him to be bound with two chains; and inquired, who he was, and what he had done.
044	ACT	021	034	But some in the croud bawled out one thing and some another: and as he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the castle.
044	ACT	021	035	And when he was upon the stairs, he was even borne by the soldiers, because of the violence of the people.
044	ACT	021	036	For the multitude followed crying out, Away with him.
044	ACT	021	037	And as Paul was going to be led into the castle, he said to the tribune, May I be allowed to speak a word to thee? And he said, Canst thou speak Greek?
044	ACT	021	038	Art not thou that Egyptian, who before this madest a sedition, and didst lead out into the wilderness four thousand murtherers?
044	ACT	021	039	But Paul said, I am indeed a Jew, a man of Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and I beg thou wouldest permit me to speak to the people.
044	ACT	021	040	And when he gave him leave, Paul standing on the stairs made a sign with the hand to the people: and there being a great silence made, He spake to them in the Hebrew tongue, saying,
044	ACT	022	001	Brethren, and Fathers, hear now my apology to you,
044	ACT	022	002	---(and when they heard that he spake to them in the Hebrew dialect, they the more readily kept silence, and he said,)
044	ACT	022	003	---I am indeed a Jew, born at Tarsus in Cilicia, but educated in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, accurately instructed in the law of our fathers, being zealous for God, as ye all are this day.
044	ACT	022	004	And I persecuted those of this persuasion even unto death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women.
044	ACT	022	005	As the high priest is my witness, and all the elders: from whom I received letters to our brethren, and went to Damascus to bring those also, that were there, bound to Jerusalem, to be punished.
044	ACT	022	006	And it came to pass that as I was on my journey and drew nigh to Damascus, about mid-day, on a sudden a great light from heaven shone round about me:
044	ACT	022	007	and I fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?
044	ACT	022	008	And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And He said unto me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.
044	ACT	022	009	And they that were with me saw the light indeed, and were affrighted; but they did not hear the voice of Him that spake to me.
044	ACT	022	010	And I said, Lord, what shall I do? And the Lord said unto me, Arise, and go on to Damascus, and there it shall be told thee concerning all things which are appointed for thee to do.
044	ACT	022	011	And as I could not see by reason of the glory of that light, being led by the hand by those that were with me, I came to Damascus.
044	ACT	022	012	And one Ananias, a devout observer of the law, who had a good character from all the Jews that dwelt there,
044	ACT	022	013	came to me, and stood by me, and said, Brother Saul, look up: and I immediately looked up upon him.
044	ACT	022	014	And he said, The God of our Fathers hath before appointed thee to know his will, and to see the just One, and to hear a voice from his mouth.
044	ACT	022	015	For thou shalt be his witness unto all men, of what thou hast seen and heard.
044	ACT	022	016	And now why shouldst thou delay? Arise and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling upon the name of the Lord.
044	ACT	022	017	And when I was returned to Jerusalem, and was praying in the temple, I was in a trance.
044	ACT	022	018	And I saw Him saying unto me, Make haste and go quickly out of Jerusalem; for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me.
044	ACT	022	019	And I said, Lord, they themselves know that I imprisoned and scourged in the synagogues them that believed on Thee.
044	ACT	022	020	And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also stood by and consented to his death, and kept the clothes of them that slew him.
044	ACT	022	021	But he said unto me, Go away; for I will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles.---
044	ACT	022	022	And they heard him to this word, and then they exalted their voice, saying, Away with such a fellow from the earth; for it is not fit that he should live.
044	ACT	022	023	And as they were bawling out, and throwing off their clothes, and casting up dust into the air,
044	ACT	022	024	the tribune commanded him to be brought into the castle, and ordered him to be put to the question by scourging; that he might know for what reason they so cried out against him.
044	ACT	022	025	And as they were binding him with thongs, Paul said to the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman, uncondemned?
044	ACT	022	026	And the centurion hearing this, went and told the tribune, saying, Consider what thou art about to do; for this man is a Roman.
044	ACT	022	027	Then the tribune came and said to him, Tell me, art thou a Roman? And he said, Yes.
044	ACT	022	028	And the tribune replied, I obtained this freedom with a large sum of money. And Paul said, But I was free-born.
044	ACT	022	029	Immediately therefore those who were going to put him to the question quitted him: and the tribune also was afraid, when he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.
044	ACT	022	030	And on the morrow, desiring to know for certain what he was accused of by the Jews, he loosed him from his bonds, and ordered the chief priests and all their council to attend; and he brought down Paul, and set him before them:
044	ACT	023	001	and Paul looking earnestly at the sanhedrim, said, "Brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God even to this day:"
044	ACT	023	002	but the high priest Ananias ordered those that stood next him, to smite him on the mouth.
044	ACT	023	003	Then said Paul to him, "God will smite thee, thou whited wall: dost thou sit to judge me according to the law, and contrary to the law commandest me to be smitten?"
044	ACT	023	004	But they that stood by said, Revilest thou God's high-priest?
044	ACT	023	005	And Paul said, I was not aware, brethren, that it was the high-priest: for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people.
044	ACT	023	006	But Paul, knowing that the one part were sadducees, and the other pharisees, cried out in the sanhedrim, "Brethren, I am a pharisee, the son of a pharisee: for the hope of a resurrection of the dead I am now prosecuted."
044	ACT	023	007	Upon his saying this, there rose a contention between the pharisees and the sadducees; and the people were divided.
044	ACT	023	008	For the sadducees say that there is no resurrection, nor angel, nor spirit; but the pharisees acknowledge both.
044	ACT	023	009	So there was a great clamor: and the scribes that were of the party of the pharisees rose up and contended, saying, We find no evil in this man; but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him, let us not fight against God.
044	ACT	023	010	But as there arose much contention, the tribune fearing least Paul should be torn in pieces by them, ordered a party of soldiers to go down, and take him by force out of the midst of them, and to bring him into the castle.
044	ACT	023	011	And the following night, the Lord standing by him said, Paul, be of good courage; for as thou hast testified concerning me at Jerusalem, so must thou also bear testimony at Rome.
044	ACT	023	012	And when it was day, some of the Jews, having formed a conspiracy, bound themselves with a curse, saying, that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.
044	ACT	023	013	And they were more than forty that had made this oath:
044	ACT	023	014	who came to the chief priests and the elders, and said, "We have bound ourselves by a curse to eat nothing till we have killed Paul.
044	ACT	023	015	Now therefore do ye with the rest of the sanhedrim signify to the tribune, that he would bring him down to you to-morrow, as if you would examine more accurately some things concerning him: and we are ready to dispatch him before he come near you."
044	ACT	023	016	But Paul's sister's son, hearing of the ambush, came and entered into the castle, and told Paul.
044	ACT	023	017	Then Paul called one of the centurions to him, and said, Introduce this young man to the tribune; for he hath something to tell him.
044	ACT	023	018	So he took him and brought him to the tribune, and said, Paul the prisoner called me to him, and desired me to introduce this young man unto thee, as having something to say to thee.
044	ACT	023	019	And the tribune took him by the hand, and retiring into a private apartment asked him, What is it which thou hast to tell me?
044	ACT	023	020	And he said, The Jews have agreed to desire thee, that thou wouldest bring down Paul to-morrow to the council, as if they would inquire something more strictly concerning him.
044	ACT	023	021	But do not thou comply with them: for there lie in wait for him more than forty men of them, who have bound themselves with a curse neither to eat nor drink till they have killed him: and they are now ready, waiting for an order from thee.
044	ACT	023	022	Then the tribune dismissed the young man, charging him, Tell no one that thou hast discovered these things to me.
044	ACT	023	023	And he called two of the centurions to him, and said, Get ready two hundred soldiers to go to Cesarea, and seventy horsemen, and two hundred spearmen, by the third hour of the night.
044	ACT	023	024	And provide beasts, that they may set Paul on and bring him safe to Felix the governor.
044	ACT	023	025	And he wrote a letter to this effect:
044	ACT	023	026	Claudius Lysias to the most excellent governor Felix sendeth greeting.
044	ACT	023	027	This man being seized by the Jews, and about to be killed by them, I came upon them with some soldiers and rescued him: for I understand that he is a Roman.
044	ACT	023	028	But desiring to know the cause for which they accused him, I brought him down into their council:
044	ACT	023	029	and I found he was accused about questions of their law, but had no charge against him deserving death or bonds.
044	ACT	023	030	But an ambush, which was going to be laid for the man by the Jews, being discovered to me, immediately I sent him to thee, telling his accusers also to say before thee what they had against him. Farewell.
044	ACT	023	031	The soldiers therefore, according to the orders given them, took up Paul, and brought him by night to Antipatris.
044	ACT	023	032	And the next day they returned to the castle, leaving the horsemen to go with him;
044	ACT	023	033	who, when they came into Cesarea, and delivered the epistle to the governor, presented Paul also before him.
044	ACT	023	034	And when the governor had read the letter, and asked of what province he was; being informed that he was of Cilicia, he said,
044	ACT	023	035	I will hear thee, when thine accusers are also come. And he ordered him to be kept in Herod's palace.
044	ACT	024	001	And after five days, the high-priest Ananias came down with the elders, and one Tertulius an orator, who appeared before the governor against Paul.
044	ACT	024	002	And when he was called, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, "As by thee we enjoy much peace, and glorious things are done to this nation by thy prudent administration,
044	ACT	024	003	we acknowledge it upon all occasions and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness.
044	ACT	024	004	But that I may not trespass upon thee too far, I beg thou wouldst hear us a few words with thy wonted goodness.
044	ACT	024	005	For having found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ring-leader of the sect of the Nazarenes,
044	ACT	024	006	and attempting to profane the temple, we apprehended him, and would have judged him according to our law.
044	ACT	024	007	But Lysias the tribune came upon us, and with great violence took him away out of our hands, commanding his accusers to come unto thee:
044	ACT	024	008	from whom thou mayst thyself by examining him come to the knowledge of all these things of which we accuse him."
044	ACT	024	009	And the Jews also assented, saying, that these things were so.
044	ACT	024	010	Then Paul, when the governor permitted him to speak, answered in this manner, "As I know that thou hast been many years a judge to this nation, I do the more chearfully answer for myself:
044	ACT	024	011	because thou mayst know, that there are not more than twelve days since I went up to worship at Jerusalem:
044	ACT	024	012	and they neither found me disputing with any one in the temple, or making sedition among the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city:
044	ACT	024	013	nor can they prove the things of which they now accuse me.
044	ACT	024	014	But this I confess unto thee, that after the way, which they call heresy, so do I worship the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law, and the prophets:
044	ACT	024	015	having hope in God, (which they themselves also expect) that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.
044	ACT	024	016	And on this account do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of offence both towards God and towards men.
044	ACT	024	017	Now after several years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings.
044	ACT	024	018	Upon which some Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with multitude nor with tumult:
044	ACT	024	019	who ought to have been here before thee, and make good their charge, if they had any thing against me.
044	ACT	024	020	Or let these themselves say, if they found any crime in me, when I stood before the sanhedrim;
044	ACT	024	021	unless for this one expression, that I cried out when I stood among them, For the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day."
044	ACT	024	022	And when Felix heard these things he put them off, (for he had been more particularly informed concerning this way of religion,) and said, When Lysias the tribune comes down, I will thoroughly examine your matters.
044	ACT	024	023	And he commanded the centurion to keep Paul secure, and to let him have some liberty, and to hinder none of his friends from assisting him or coming to him.
044	ACT	024	024	Some days after Felix coming with his wife Drusilla, a Jewess, sent for Paul, and heard him concerning faith in Christ.
044	ACT	024	025	And as he was reasoning of justice, temperance, and a future judgement, Felix trembled, and said, Go thy way for this time, and I will take a proper opportunity to call for thee again.
044	ACT	024	026	And hoping also that money would be given him by Paul, that he might discharge him; he sent for him the more frequently, and conversed with him.
044	ACT	024	027	But after two years Felix received a successor, Porcius Festus; and being willing to gain favor with the Jews lest Paul confined.
044	ACT	025	001	Festus therefore, being come into the province, after three days went up from Cesarea to Jerusalem.
044	ACT	025	002	And the high-priest and principal men among the Jews, appeared before him against Paul, and made application to him,
044	ACT	025	003	begging the favor of him, that he would send for him to Jerusalem; for they were preparing an ambush to kill him by the way.
044	ACT	025	004	But Festus answered, that Paul was in custody at Cesarea, and that he himself should go thither soon.
044	ACT	025	005	Therefore, said he, let those of you who are able, go down with me, and if there be any thing bad in this man, let them accuse him.
044	ACT	025	006	And when he had staid among them more than ten days, he went down to Cesarea, and the next day sitting on the tribunal, he commanded Paul to be brought before him.
044	ACT	025	007	And when he was come, the Jews that came down from Jerusalem, stood round about, bringing many heavy charges against Paul, which they were not able to prove:
044	ACT	025	008	he answering in his own defence, Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Cesar have I committed any offence.
044	ACT	025	009	But Festus, being desirous to gain favor with the Jews, answered Paul and said, Art thou willing to go up to Jerusalem, and there to be tried concerning these things before me?
044	ACT	025	010	Then said Paul, I stand at Cesar's tribunal, where I ought to be tried: I have done no wrong to the Jews, as thou very well knowest.
044	ACT	025	011	For if I am indeed doing them wrong, and have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but if there be nothing in what these men accuse me of, no one can give me up to them.
044	ACT	025	012	I appeal to Cesar. Then Festus, conferring with his council, answered, Hast thou appealed to Cesar? to Cesar thou shalt go.
044	ACT	025	013	And some days after king Agrippa and Bernice came to Cesarea to salute Festus.
044	ACT	025	014	And as they spent several days there, Festus related Paul's case to the king, saying, There is a man left in custody by Felix: concerning whom,
044	ACT	025	015	when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews appeared in court, desiring judgement against him.
044	ACT	025	016	To whom I answered, it is not the custom of the Romans to give up any man to destruction, till he that is accused have the accusers face to face, and have an opportunity of making his defence concerning the accusation.
044	ACT	025	017	Therefore when they were come hither, making no delay, I sat on the tribunal the next day, and ordered the man to be brought before me.
044	ACT	025	018	Against whom, when the accusers stood up, they brought no charge of such things as I supposed they would:
044	ACT	025	019	but had certain questions against him concerning their own religion; and of one Jesus that was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.
044	ACT	025	020	But I being in doubt as to the dispute concerning these matters, asked him, if he would go to Jerusalem, and there be tried concerning these things.
044	ACT	025	021	But when Paul appealed, to be reserved to the hearing of our sovereign, I ordered him to be kept till I could send him to Cesar.
044	ACT	025	022	Then Agrippa said to Festus, I should be willing to hear the man myself. And he said, thou shalt hear him to-morrow.
044	ACT	025	023	The next day therefore, Agrippa and Bernice coming with much pomp, and entering into the court, together with the chief officers, and men of greatest eminence in the city, at the command of Festus Paul was brought in.
044	ACT	025	024	And Festus said, "King Agrippa and all that are here present with us, ye see this man, concerning whom all the Jews have applied to me, both at Jerusalem and here, crying out, that he ought not to live.
044	ACT	025	025	But when I found that he had done nothing worthy of death, and as he himself has appealed to the emperor, I have determined to send him.
044	ACT	025	026	Concerning whom I have nothing certain to write to our sovereign: wherefore I have brought him out before you, and especially before thee, O king Agrippa, that after examination is made I may have somewhat to write.
044	ACT	025	027	For it seems to me absurd, to send a prisoner and not to signify the crimes laid against him."
044	ACT	026	001	Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for thyself. Then Paul stretching forth his hand, thus made his defence,
044	ACT	026	002	"O king Agrippa, I think myself happy, that I am this day to make my defence before thee, concerning all the things which I am accused of by the Jews:
044	ACT	026	003	especially as thou art acquainted with all the customs and questions which are among the Jews; wherefore I intreat thee to hear me patiently.
044	ACT	026	004	My manner of life then from my youth, as it has been from the beginning among my own nation at Jerusalem, all the Jews are acquainted with,
044	ACT	026	005	knowing me before, (if they would testify it,) that according to the strictest sect of our religion I lived a pharisee.
044	ACT	026	006	And now I stand arraigned for the hope of the promise which was made by God to our fathers:
044	ACT	026	007	to which promise our twelve tribes, worshipping continually night and day, hope to attain: concerning which hope, O king Agrippa, I am accused by the Jews.
044	ACT	026	008	What! is it judged incredible by you, that God should raise the dead?
044	ACT	026	009	I indeed once thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus the Nazarene:
044	ACT	026	010	which I also did in Jerusalem; and I shut up many of the saints in prison, having received authority for it from the chief priests; and when they were put to death I gave my voice against them.
044	ACT	026	011	And often punishing them in all the synagogues, I compelled them to blaspheme, and being excessively enraged against them, I persecuted them even to foreign cities.
044	ACT	026	012	On which accounts as I was going to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests---at mid-day,
044	ACT	026	013	O king, as I was on the way thither I saw a light from heaven exceeding the splendor of the sun, shining round about me and those that were going with me.
044	ACT	026	014	And when we were all fallen down to the earth, I heard a voice speaking to me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why dost thou persecute me? It is hard for thee to kick against the goads.
044	ACT	026	015	And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And He said, I am Jesus, whom thou persecutest.
044	ACT	026	016	But rise, and stand on thy feet: for to this end have I appeared unto thee, to appoint thee a minister and a witness both of the things which thou hast seen, and of those for which I shall hereafter appear unto thee:
044	ACT	026	017	delivering thee from the people and from the Gentiles, to whom I now send thee,
044	ACT	026	018	to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of satan unto God; that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and an inheritance among them that are sanctified by faith in me.
044	ACT	026	019	Wherefore, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision:
044	ACT	026	020	but declared first to those in Damascus and Jerusalem, and through all the country of Judea, and then to the Gentiles, that they should repent, and turn unto God, performing works suitable to repentance.
044	ACT	026	021	For these things the Jews seized me in the temple, and attempted to kill me.
044	ACT	026	022	But having obtained help of God, I continue until this day, testifying both to small and great, and saying nothing but what the prophets and Moses declared should come to pass; even that the Messiah should suffer,
044	ACT	026	023	and being the first of the resurrection from the dead should bring light to the people and to the Gentiles."
044	ACT	026	024	And as he was saying these things in his defence, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself: much learning turns thy brain.
044	ACT	026	025	But he replied, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but I speak the words of truth and of a sound mind.
044	ACT	026	026	For the king knoweth of these things, to whom also I speak with freedom; because I am persuaded that none of them are unknown to him; for this was not done in a corner.
044	ACT	026	027	O king Agrippa, believest thou the prophets?
044	ACT	026	028	I know that thou believest them. Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou almost persuadest me to be a Christian.
044	ACT	026	029	And Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds.
044	ACT	026	030	And when he had said this, the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and those that sat with them.
044	ACT	026	031	And when they were retired, they spake to each other, saying, this man hath done nothing worthy of death or of bonds.
044	ACT	026	032	And Agrippa said to Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed to Cesar.
044	ACT	027	001	Now as it was determined that we should sail to Italy, they delivered Paul and some other prisoners to a centurion named Julius, of the Augustan cohort.
044	ACT	027	002	And going on board a ship of Adramyttium, we went off, intending to sail by the coasts of Asia; Aristarchus a Macedonian of Thessalonica being with us.
044	ACT	027	003	And the next day we touched at Sidon. And Julius treating Paul with great humanity, permitted him to go to his friends to get proper supplies.
044	ACT	027	004	And when we departed from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.
044	ACT	027	005	And sailing through the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra a city of Lycia.
044	ACT	027	006	And there the centurion finding a ship of Alexandria bound for Italy, he put us on board it.
044	ACT	027	007	And as we sailed slowly for many days, and were hardly got on to Cnidus, the wind not permitting us, we sailed under Crete by Salmone.
044	ACT	027	008	And passing it with difficulty, we came to a place called the Fair-havens, near to which was the city of Lasea.
044	ACT	027	009	And as much time was spent, and sailing was now dangerous, (for the fast was now past,) Paul exhorted them,
044	ACT	027	010	saying, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage is like to be prejudicial and with much damage, not only of the lading and of the ship, but also of our lives.
044	ACT	027	011	But the centurion regarded the pilot and the master of the vessel, more than the things that were said by Paul.
044	ACT	027	012	And the haven not being commodious to winter in, the greater part advised to sail from thence, if they could possibly reach to Phenice to winter at that haven of Crete, which looks both to the south-west and north-west.
044	ACT	027	013	And as the south wind blew gently, thinking they were secure of their purpose, they weighed anchor and sailed close by Crete.
044	ACT	027	014	But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind called Euroclydon.
044	ACT	027	015	And the ship being hurried on, and not able to face the wind, we gave it up and so were carried along.
044	ACT	027	016	And running under a certain island called Clauda, we were hardly able to become masters of the boat.
044	ACT	027	017	Which when they had hoisted up, they used helps, undergirding the ship; and fearing least they should fall into the quick-sands, they struck fail, and so were driven.
044	ACT	027	018	And as we were exceedingly tossed by the storm, the next day they lightened the ship:
044	ACT	027	019	and the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship too.
044	ACT	027	020	And as neither sun nor stars appeared for several days, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope of our being saved was now taken away.
044	ACT	027	021	But after long abstinence from food, Paul stood up in the midst of them and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not loosed from Crete, and so have saved this damage and loss.
044	ACT	027	022	However, I now exhort you to be of good courage: for there shall be no loss of any life among you, but only of the ship:
044	ACT	027	023	for there stood by me this night an angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve, saying,
044	ACT	027	024	Fear not, Paul, thou must be brought before Cesar, and behold God hath given thee all that are sailing with thee.
044	ACT	027	025	Wherefore, Sirs, be of good courage; for I trust in God, that it shall be so, according as it was told me.
044	ACT	027	026	But we must be cast upon some island.
044	ACT	027	027	And when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in the Adriatic sea, about the middle of the night the mariners thought they drew near to some land:
044	ACT	027	028	and sounding they found it twenty fathoms; and when they had gone a little farther, and sounded again, they found it fifteen fathoms.
044	ACT	027	029	Then fearing least they should fall upon some rocky places, they cast four anchors out of the stern and wished for day.
044	ACT	027	030	But the mariners endeavouring to flee out of the ship, and having let down the boat into the sea, under pretence that they were going to stretch out anchors from the head of the ship,
044	ACT	027	031	Paul said to the centurion, and to the soldiers, Unless these men stay in the ship ye cannot be saved.
044	ACT	027	032	Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let it fall off.
044	ACT	027	033	And while the day was coming on, Paul exhorted them all to take some food, saying, Fourteen days this day ye continue waiting without proper food, having taken nothing:
044	ACT	027	034	wherefore I exhort you to take some nourishment, for this is necessary for your safety: for there shall not a hair fall from the head of any of you.
044	ACT	027	035	And having spoken thus, he took bread and gave thanks to God in presence of them all, and when he had broken it he began to eat.
044	ACT	027	036	And being all encouraged they also took some food.
044	ACT	027	037	And we were in all in the ship two hundred and seventy-six souls.
044	ACT	027	038	And when they were satisfied with food, they lightened the ship and cast out the corn into the sea.
044	ACT	027	039	And when it was day, they did not know the land near them: but they perceived a certain creek with a shore, into which they were desirous, if they could, to have thrust the ship.
044	ACT	027	040	And when they had taken up the anchors, they trusted the ship to the sea, at the same time, loosing the rudder-bands; and hoisting up the main-sail to the wind, they made to the shore.
044	ACT	027	041	But falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship a-ground; and the fore-part stuck fast, and remained immoveable, but the hinder part was dashed in pieces by the violence of the waves.
044	ACT	027	042	And the counsel of the soldiers was to kill the prisoners, least any of them should swim out and escape.
044	ACT	027	043	But the centurion, desirous to save Paul, hindered them from their purpose, and ordered those that could swim to throw themselves out first, and get off to land:
044	ACT	027	044	and the rest, some on planks, and others on some other things out of the ship. And so it came to pass that they all got safe to land.
044	ACT	028	001	And when they were safe on shore, they understood, that the island was called Melita.
044	ACT	028	002	And the barbarians shewed us uncommon humanity: for they kindled a fire and took us all in, because of the present rain, and of the cold.
044	ACT	028	003	And Paul having gathered together a bundle of sticks, and laid them on the fire, there came out a viper from the heat, and fastened on his hand.
044	ACT	028	004	And when the barbarians saw the venomous creature hanging on his hand, they said to one another, This man is certainly a murderer, whom, though he hath been saved from the sea, yet justice suffereth not to live.
044	ACT	028	005	But he shook off the creature into the fire, and suffered no hurt.
044	ACT	028	006	They however were expecting that he would swell, or suddenly fall down dead: but when they had waited a good while, and saw no hurt come to him, they changed their opinion and said that he was a god.
044	ACT	028	007	Now in the parts adjacent to this place was the seat of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius, who took us into his house, and entertained us three days courteously.
044	ACT	028	008	And it happened that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and dysentery: to whom Paul went in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him.
044	ACT	028	009	Upon this, others also in the island, who had diseases came to him and were cured:
044	ACT	028	010	who also honoured us with many honors, and furnished us, when we departed, with such things as were necessary.
044	ACT	028	011	And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, that had wintered in the island, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.
044	ACT	028	012	And being arrived at Syracuse, we staid there three days.
044	ACT	028	013	From whence coasting round we came to Rhegium, and after one day a south-wind rising, we came the second day to Puteoli:
044	ACT	028	014	where finding some brethren, we were desired to stay with them seven days: and so we went on to Rome.
044	ACT	028	015	And when the brethren heard of us, they came from thence to meet us, some as far as Appii-forum, and others to the Three-taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God and took courage.
044	ACT	028	016	And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was permitted to live by himself with the soldier that had him in custody.
044	ACT	028	017	And after three days Paul called together the chief of the Jews. And when they were come together, he said unto them, Brethren, though I have done nothing against the people of the Jews, or the customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans:
044	ACT	028	018	who when they had examined me, would have set me at liberty, because there was no crime worthy of death found in me:
044	ACT	028	019	but the Jews opposing it, I was obliged to appeal to Cesar; though not as having any thing to accuse my nation of.
044	ACT	028	020	For this reason therefore I desired to see and to speak to you: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.
044	ACT	028	021	And they said to him, We have neither received letters concerning thee from Judea, nor has any of the brethren, that is come hither, related or spoken any ill of thee.
044	ACT	028	022	But we would willingly hear from thee what thou thinkest: for as to this sect, we know that it is every where spoken against.
044	ACT	028	023	And having appointed him a day, many came to him at his lodging; to whom he discoursed and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them of the things concerning Jesus, both from the law of Moses, and from the prophets, from morning till evening.
044	ACT	028	024	And some regarded the things that were spoken, but others did not believe.
044	ACT	028	025	And so disagreeing one with another they separated, when Paul had said one word, to wit, that the holy Spirit spake rightly by Esaias the prophet to our fathers,
044	ACT	028	026	saying, Go to this people and say, Ye shall hear by the hearing of the ear, and not understand; and in seeing ye shall see, and not perceive: for the heart of this people is stupified,
044	ACT	028	027	and they hear heavily with their ears, and have closed their eyes; least they should see at all with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.
044	ACT	028	028	Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent to the Gentiles, and they will hear it.
044	ACT	028	029	And when he had said these things, the Jews departed, having much debate among themselves.
044	ACT	028	030	And Paul abode two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came to him:
044	ACT	028	031	preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ, with all freedom, none forbidding him.

045	ROM	001	001	Paul a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle,
045	ROM	001	002	separated unto the gospel of God, (which He had promised before by his prophets in the holy scriptures) concerning his Son,
045	ROM	001	003	who was of the seed of David according to the flesh,
045	ROM	001	004	but powerfully declared to be the Son of God, according to the spirit of holiness, by his resurrection from the dead, even Jesus Christ our Lord;
045	ROM	001	005	by whom we have received grace and apostleship to preach the obedience of faith for his name's sake, to all nations;
045	ROM	001	006	among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ;
045	ROM	001	007	to all that are in Rome beloved of God, called and holy: grace be to you, and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
045	ROM	001	008	And first I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is celebrated through the whole world:
045	ROM	001	009	for God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, how incessantly I make mention of you always in my prayers,
045	ROM	001	010	intreating if I may now at length have a prosperous journey by the will of God, to come unto you.
045	ROM	001	011	For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift, that you may be established:
045	ROM	001	012	that is to say, that being among you we may be comforted together by the faith of each, both yours and mine.
045	ROM	001	013	And I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that I often purposed to come unto you, (but have been hindered hitherto) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among the other Gentiles.
045	ROM	001	014	For I am a debtor both to Greeks and barbarians, both to the learned and the unlearned:
045	ROM	001	015	therefore am I ready, as much as in me lies, to preach the gospel to you also that are at Rome.
045	ROM	001	016	For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ; for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth, both Jew and Greek:
045	ROM	001	017	for the righteousness of God is therein revealed from faith to faith; as it is written, "The just shall live by faith."
045	ROM	001	018	For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who withhold the truth in unrighteousness;
045	ROM	001	019	for what is to be known of God is manifest among them, for God hath manifested it to them.
045	ROM	001	020	Inasmuch as from the first creation of the world, the invisible things of Him, even his eternal power and Godhead, are, if attended to, clearly seen in his works:
045	ROM	001	021	so that they are inexcusable; because having thus known God they glorified Him not as God, neither were they thankful; but were infatuated by their own reasonings, and their heart being void of understanding was darkened.
045	ROM	001	022	Pretending to be wise they Became fools:
045	ROM	001	023	and changed the glory of the incorruptible God for an image like to corruptible man, and birds, and beasts, and reptiles.
045	ROM	001	024	Wherefore God also gave them up to impurity, in the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies among themselves;
045	ROM	001	025	who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature instead of the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.
045	ROM	001	026	Therefore God gave them up to infamous passions: for even their women changed the natural use into that which is unnatural,
045	ROM	001	027	and the men likewise, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust to one another, men with men committing shame, and receiving in themselves the recompence of their error which they deserved.
045	ROM	001	028	And as they were not careful to acknowledge God, God gave them up to an undiscerning mind to do things that were not fit to be done:
045	ROM	001	029	being filled with all injustice, lewdness, wickedness, covetousness, malignity; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, and every evil habit; whisperers,
045	ROM	001	030	slanderers, haters of God, injurious, haughty, proud, inventers of mischief, undutiful to parents, void of understanding,
045	ROM	001	031	covenant-breakers, without natural affection, implacable, and unmerciful:
045	ROM	001	032	who though they knew the just judgement of God, (that they who commit such practises are worthy of death) yet not only do these very things, but also countenance and encourage others in the practice of them.
045	ROM	002	001	Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whoever thou art, that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest dost the same things.
045	ROM	002	002	But we know that the judgement of God is according to truth against those that do such things.
045	ROM	002	003	And thinkest thou, O man, who judgest those that do such things, and dost the same, that thou shalt escape the judgement of God?
045	ROM	002	004	Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness, and forbearance, and long-suffering, not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?
045	ROM	002	005	But by thy hardness and impenitence of heart thou art treasuring up to thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the just judgement of God,
045	ROM	002	006	who will render to every one according to his works:
045	ROM	002	007	to them, who by perseverance in well-doing seek for glory, and honor, and immortality, eternal life:
045	ROM	002	008	but to those who are contentious, and obey not the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath.
045	ROM	002	009	Tribulation and anguish shall be upon every soul of man that worketh evil, both of the Jew, and of the Gentile:
045	ROM	002	010	but glory, and honor, and peace to every one that worketh good, both to the Jew, and to the Greek:
045	ROM	002	011	for there is no respect of persons with God.
045	ROM	002	012	For as many as have sinned without the law shall also perish without the law; and as many as have sinned under the law shall be judged by the law;
045	ROM	002	013	(for not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified:
045	ROM	002	014	for when the Gentiles, who have not the law, do by nature the duties of the law, these though they have not the law, are a law to themselves,
045	ROM	002	015	and shew the work of the law written on their hearts, their conscience witnessing together with it, and their own thoughts either accusing, or excusing them,)
045	ROM	002	016	in the day when God will judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ, according to my gospel.
045	ROM	002	017	Behold thou art called a Jew, and restest on the law, and boastest in God,
045	ROM	002	018	and knowest his will, and approvest things that are excellent, being instructed out of the law,
045	ROM	002	019	and art persuaded that thou art a guide of the blind,
045	ROM	002	020	a light to them that are in the darkness, an instructor of the simple, a teacher of babes, having the form of the knowledge and of the truth which is in the law.
045	ROM	002	021	Thou then, who teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? Thou, that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?
045	ROM	002	022	Thou, that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? Thou, that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege?
045	ROM	002	023	Thou, that boastest in the law, dost thou by transgression of the law dishonour God?
045	ROM	002	024	for through you the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles, as it is written.
045	ROM	002	025	For circumcision indeed is profitable, if thou keep the law: but if thou be a transgressor of the law, thy circumcision is become uncircumcision.
045	ROM	002	026	Therefore if the uncircumcised keep the righteous precepts of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be accounted to him for circumcision?
045	ROM	002	027	and shall not the uncircumcision that is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision art a transgressor of the law? for he is not a Jew, who is only so in appearance;
045	ROM	002	028	nor is that circumcision, which is only in appearance, in the flesh;
045	ROM	002	029	but he is a Jew who is one inwardly, and circumcision is that of the heart in the spirit, not in the letter: whose praise is not from men, but from God.
045	ROM	003	001	What then is the advantage of the Jew, or what is the profit of circumcision?
045	ROM	003	002	Much, every way: chiefly, because they were intrusted with the oracles of God.
045	ROM	003	003	For what if some did not believe? shall their incredulity make the faithfulness of God of no effect?
045	ROM	003	004	God forbid: yea, let God be acknowledged true, though every man be a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy words, and mightest overcome, when thou judgest.
045	ROM	003	005	"But if our unrighteousness confirm the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is not God unrighteous, who inflicteth his wrath?" (I speak as a man) God forbid:
045	ROM	003	006	for then how shall God judge the world?
045	ROM	003	007	"But, say you, if the truth of God hath abounded unto his glory through my falshood, why yet am I also judged as a sinner?
045	ROM	003	008	and why may we not do evil that good may come?"---as we are injuriously charged, and as some affirm that we say; whose condemnation is just.
045	ROM	003	009	"What then are we the better?" Not at all, in point of justification; for we have before proved that both Jews and Gentiles are all under sin: as it is written,
045	ROM	003	010	"There is none righteous, no not one;
045	ROM	003	011	there is none that understandeth; there is none that seeketh after God.
045	ROM	003	012	They are all gone out of the way, they are become unprofitable, there is none that practiseth goodness, no not one.
045	ROM	003	013	Their throat is an open sepulchre: with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips:
045	ROM	003	014	whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:
045	ROM	003	015	their feet are swift to shed blood:
045	ROM	003	016	destruction and misery are in their ways:
045	ROM	003	017	and the way of peace they have not known; and the fear of God is not before their eyes."
045	ROM	003	018	Now we know that whatsoever the law saith,
045	ROM	003	019	it saith to those under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world obnoxious to the justice of God.
045	ROM	003	020	Wherefore by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified before Him: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.
045	ROM	003	021	But now, without the law, righteousness before God is manifested, being attested by the law and the prophets;
045	ROM	003	022	and this righteousness of God is by faith in Jesus Christ unto all and upon all believers; for there is no difference;
045	ROM	003	023	for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God;
045	ROM	003	024	being justified freely by his grace, because of the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:
045	ROM	003	025	whom God hath appointed to be a propitiation, through faith in his blood, for a demonstration of his righteousness, in the remission of past sins, according to the forbearance of God;
045	ROM	003	026	for a demonstration, I say, of his righteousness at this time: that He might be just, and the justifier of him, that believeth in Jesus.
045	ROM	003	027	Where then is boasting? it is excluded: by what law? of works? no: but by the law of faith.
045	ROM	003	028	Therefore we conclude, that a man is justified by faith, without the works of the law:
045	ROM	003	029	or is He the God of the Jews only, and not also of the Gentiles?
045	ROM	003	030	surely of the Gentiles also: seeing it is one God who will justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision also through faith.
045	ROM	003	031	Do we then make the law of none effect through faith? God forbid: yea we establish the law.
045	ROM	004	001	What shall we say then that Abraham our father obtained according to the flesh?
045	ROM	004	002	for if Abraham were justified by works, he hath something to boast of; but this he hath not before God:
045	ROM	004	003	for what saith the scripture? "Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness."
045	ROM	004	004	Now to him that worketh the reward is not reckoned as a favor, but as a debt:
045	ROM	004	005	but to him that worketh not, but believeth on Him who justifieth the ungodly, his faith is accounted for righteousness.
045	ROM	004	006	As David also describeth the blessedness of the man to whom: God imputeth righteousness without works, saying,
045	ROM	004	007	"Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered:
045	ROM	004	008	blessed is the man to whom the Lord imputeth not sin."
045	ROM	004	009	Now is this blessedness upon the circumcised only, or upon the uncircumcised also? for we say that faith was accounted to Abraham for righteousness.
045	ROM	004	010	How then was it accounted to him? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.
045	ROM	004	011	And he received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had in uncircumcision: that he might be the father of all that believe though not circumcised, that righteousness may be imputed to them also:
045	ROM	004	012	and the father of circumcision to those, who not only are of the circumcision, but also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had in uncircumcision.
045	ROM	004	013	For the promise made to Abraham, or to his seed, that he should be heir of the world, was not by the law, but by the righteousness of faith:
045	ROM	004	014	for if they only that are of the law be heirs, faith is made useless, and the promise is become of no effect.
045	ROM	004	015	Now the law worketh wrath; for where there is no law, there is no transgression.
045	ROM	004	016	And therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace, that so the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but also to that which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all,
045	ROM	004	017	(as it is written, "I have made thee a father of many nations,") in the sight of Him whom he believed, even God, who giveth life to the dead, and calleth the things that are not as if they were:
045	ROM	004	018	who against hope believed, with hope, that he should be the father of many nations, according to that which was said unto him, "So shall thy seed be."
045	ROM	004	019	And not being weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, being about an hundred years old; nor the deadness of Sarah's womb.
045	ROM	004	020	He hesitated not at the promise of God through unbelief: but was strong in faith, giving glory to God,
045	ROM	004	021	and being fully persuaded, that what was promised He was able to perform:
045	ROM	004	022	and therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.
045	ROM	004	023	Now it was not written on his account only, that it was imputed to him:
045	ROM	004	024	but for our sakes also, to him it will be imputed, as we believe on Him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead:
045	ROM	004	025	who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification.
045	ROM	005	001	Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:
045	ROM	005	002	through whom also we have admission by faith into this grace in which we stand, and boast in hope of the glory of God.
045	ROM	005	003	And not only so, but we also glory in tribulations, knowing that tribulation worketh patience,
045	ROM	005	004	and patience experience,
045	ROM	005	005	and experience hope, and this hope maketh us not ashamed; because the love of God is diffused in our hearts by the holy Spirit that is given to us.
045	ROM	005	006	For when we were yet without strength, Christ died in due season for the ungodly.
045	ROM	005	007	Whereas one would hardly die for a just man, though perhaps for a good man one might dare even to die.
045	ROM	005	008	But God recommendeth his love towards us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
045	ROM	005	009	Much more then, being now justified by his blood, shall we be saved from wrath through Him.
045	ROM	005	010	For if when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son; much more being reconciled shall we be saved by his life.
045	ROM	005	011	And not only so, but we also boast in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received reconciliation.
045	ROM	005	012	Wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin, so death passed upon all men, for to that all have sinned:
045	ROM	005	013	for sin was in the world before the law. Now sin is not imputed where there is no law;
045	ROM	005	014	and yet death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those who had not sinned after the likeness of Adam's transgression, who is the type of Him that was to come.
045	ROM	005	015	But not as the offence, so also is the free gift: for if through the offence of one many died, much more hath the grace of God, and the gift bestowed by the grace of one man, Jesus Christ, abounded to many.
045	ROM	005	016	For the gift is not as the sentence was by one that sinned; for the sentence is passed from one offence to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offences to justification.
045	ROM	005	017	For if, by the offence of one, death reigned through one, much more they who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness, shall reign in life through one, even Jesus Christ.
045	ROM	005	018	Therefore as by the offence of one the effect of it was upon all men to condemnation: so also by the righteousness of one, the effect was upon all men to justification of life.
045	ROM	005	019	For as by the disobedience of one man many were made sinners; so by the obedience of One shall many be made righteous.
045	ROM	005	020	Now the law made some entrance, that the offence might appear to abound; but where sin abounded, grace hath superabounded; that as sin had reigned in death,
045	ROM	005	021	so grace might reign through righteousness, unto eternal life, by Jesus Christ our Lord.
045	ROM	006	001	What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?
045	ROM	006	002	God forbid! how shall we, who are dead to sin, live any longer therein?
045	ROM	006	003	Know ye not, that as many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ, were baptized into his death?
045	ROM	006	004	Therefore we are buried with Him by baptism into death: that as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we also should walk in newness of life:
045	ROM	006	005	for if we have been planted together in the resemblance of his death, so shall we be also of his resurrection.
045	ROM	006	006	Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with Him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that we might no longer be inslaved to sin:
045	ROM	006	007	for he that is thus dead with Christ, is delivered from sin.
045	ROM	006	008	Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him:
045	ROM	006	009	knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more power over Him: for as He died, He died once for all on account of sin;
045	ROM	006	010	but as He liveth, He liveth unto God.
045	ROM	006	011	So also do ye reckon yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God in Christ Jesus our Lord.
045	ROM	006	012	Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, to obey it in the lusts thereof.
045	ROM	006	013	Neither yield your bodies as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but present yourselves to God as alive from the dead, and your bodies as instruments of righteousness to God.
045	ROM	006	014	For sin shall have no power over you, inasmuch as ye are not under the law, but under grace.
045	ROM	006	015	What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace?
045	ROM	006	016	God forbid! Know ye not, that to whom ye present yourselves servants to obedience, his servants ye are whom ye obey? either of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?
045	ROM	006	017	But thanks be to God, that ye who were servants of sin, have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered to you:
045	ROM	006	018	and being set free from sin, ye are become the servants of righteousness.
045	ROM	006	019	I speak after the manner of men, because of the infirmity of your flesh: as ye have yielded your bodies servants to impurity and iniquity to work iniquity; so now present your bodies servants to righteousness, unto holiness.
045	ROM	006	020	For when ye were servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness.
045	ROM	006	021	What fruit therefore had ye then in the things, which ye are now ashamed of? for the end of those things is death.
045	ROM	006	022	But now being set free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.
045	ROM	006	023	For the wages of sin is death: but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
045	ROM	007	001	Are ye ignorant, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law) that the law hath power over a man, only so long as it liveth?
045	ROM	007	002	For a married woman is bound by the law to her husband while he is living; but if her husband die, she is discharged from the law of her husband.
045	ROM	007	003	Therefore while her husband is living, she shall be called an adulteress if she become another man's: but if her husband be dead, she is free from the law; so that she is not an adulteress, though she become another man's.
045	ROM	007	004	And thus, my brethren, ye also are dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye might become another's, even his who is raised from the dead, that we might bring forth fruit unto God.
045	ROM	007	005	For when we were in the flesh, the sinful passions while we were under the law operated in our bodies so as to bring forth fruit unto death.
045	ROM	007	006	But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead by which we were bound, that we might serve God in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.
045	ROM	007	007	What shall we say then? is the law sin? God forbid! Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust to be sinful, if the law had not said, "Thou shalt not covet."
045	ROM	007	008	But sin taking occasion by the commandment wrought in me all manner of concupiscence: for without the law sin was dead.
045	ROM	007	009	And I was heretofore alive without the law: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died:
045	ROM	007	010	and the commandment which was intended to life, I found to be unto death.
045	ROM	007	011	For sin taking occasion by the commandment deceived me, and by it slew me.
045	ROM	007	012	So that the law is holy; and the commandment holy, and just, and good.
045	ROM	007	013	Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid! But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good: that sin might be shewn by the commandment to be exceeding sinful.
045	ROM	007	014	For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.
045	ROM	007	015	For that which I do, I allow not: for I do not that which I would; but what I hate, this I do.
045	ROM	007	016	And if I do that which I would not, I consent to the law that it is good:
045	ROM	007	017	but now I am no more the doer of it, but sin that dwelleth in me.
045	ROM	007	018	For I know that in me (that is in my flesh) dwelleth no good: for to will is present with me, but how to perform that which is good, I find not.
045	ROM	007	019	For I do not the good that I would; but the evil which I would not, this I do.
045	ROM	007	020	Now if I do that which I would not, I am no more the doer of it, but sin that dwelleth in me.
045	ROM	007	021	I find then a kind of law, that when I would do good, evil besets me.
045	ROM	007	022	For I delight in the law of God, as to the inward man:
045	ROM	007	023	but I perceive another law in my body warring against the law of my mind, and captivating me to the law of sin, which is in my body.
045	ROM	007	024	Wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from this body of death?
045	ROM	007	025	The grace of God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with my mind I serve the law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin.
045	ROM	008	001	There is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit.
045	ROM	008	002	For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath set me free from the law of sin and death.
045	ROM	008	003	For that which was impossible for the law to do, and in which it was weak through the corruption of the flesh, God by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh to be a sacrifice for sin, hath done; that is, hath condemned sin in the flesh:
045	ROM	008	004	that the righteousness of the law may be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit.
045	ROM	008	005	For they who are after the flesh, mind the things of the flesh; but they who are led by the Spirit, do mind spiritual things.
045	ROM	008	006	Now to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace:
045	ROM	008	007	because the carnal mind is an enemy to God; for it is not subject to the law of God, nor indeed can be:
045	ROM	008	008	and they who are carnal, cannot please God.
045	ROM	008	009	But ye are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if the Spirit of God dwelleth in you: but if any one hath not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.
045	ROM	008	010	And if Christ be in you, the body indeed is dead because of sin, but the spirit is alive because of righteousness.
045	ROM	008	011	And if the Spirit of Him that raised up Jesus from the dead, dwelleth in you, He that raised up Christ from the dead, will also restore your mortal bodies to life, by his Spirit that now dwelleth in you.
045	ROM	008	012	Therefore, brethren, we are debtors not to the flesh, to live after the flesh:
045	ROM	008	013	for if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die; but if by the Spirit ye mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.
045	ROM	008	014	For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are the sons of God.
045	ROM	008	015	For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.
045	ROM	008	016	So that the Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God.
045	ROM	008	017	And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and co-heirs with Christ: if so be we suffer with Him, that we may be also glorified with Him.
045	ROM	008	018	And I account the sufferings of this present time not worthy to be set against the glory that shall be revealed to us.
045	ROM	008	019	For the earnest expectation of the world is waiting for the revelation of the sons of God:
045	ROM	008	020	(for the world was subjected to vanity, not willingly, but through him who made it subject:)
045	ROM	008	021	in hope that they also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.
045	ROM	008	022	For we know that the whole world groaneth, and doth as it were travail in pain together even to this day.
045	ROM	008	023	And not only others, but those also who have the first-fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit the redemption of our body.
045	ROM	008	024	For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen, is not hope; for what any one sees, how doth he yet hope for?
045	ROM	008	025	but if we hope for what we see not, then we wait for it with patience.
045	ROM	008	026	And the Spirit likewise helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for, as we ought: but the Spirit itself intercedes for us with unutterable groans.
045	ROM	008	027	And He that searcheth the hearts, knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit; for he intercedeth for the saints according to the will of God.
045	ROM	008	028	And we know that all things co-operate for good to them that love God, to them that are called according to his purpose;
045	ROM	008	029	for those whom he foreknew, He also predetermined to be conformed to the image of his Son, that He might be as the first-born among many brethren: and whom He before ordained, these He also called;
045	ROM	008	030	and whom He called, these he also justified; and whom He justified, these He also glorified.
045	ROM	008	031	What shall we say then to these things? if God be for us, who can be against us?
045	ROM	008	032	He that spared not his own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him freely give us all things?
045	ROM	008	033	Who shall lay any accusation against the elect of God? will God, who justifieth us?
045	ROM	008	034	Who is he that condemneth? Is it Christ, that died for us? yea rather, that is risen again, who is also at the right hand of God, and who maketh intercession for us?
045	ROM	008	035	Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall affliction, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?
045	ROM	008	036	(as it is written, "for thy sake we are killed all the day long, we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter:")
045	ROM	008	037	but in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him that loved us.
045	ROM	008	038	For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things future,
045	ROM	008	039	nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
045	ROM	009	001	I say the truth in Christ, I lye not, (my conscience bearing me witness in the holy Ghost,)
045	ROM	009	002	that I have great grief and continual sorrow in my heart:
045	ROM	009	003	for I could wish that I myself were made a curse after the manner of Christ, for my brethren, my kindred according to the flesh;
045	ROM	009	004	who are Israelites, whose is the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the form of divine worship, and the promises:
045	ROM	009	005	whose are the fathers, and of whom, as to the flesh, Christ came, who is over all God blessed for ever. Amen.
045	ROM	009	006	Not that the word of God hath failed. For they are not all Israel, who are descended from Israel.
045	ROM	009	007	Nor because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all children of promise: but "in Isaac shall thy seed be called."
045	ROM	009	008	That is, not the children of the flesh are the children of God, but the children of the promise are accounted for the seed.
045	ROM	009	009	For this is the word of the promise, "According to this time will I come, and Sarah shall have a son:"
045	ROM	009	010	and not to her only; but Rebecca also being with child by our father Isaac,
045	ROM	009	011	(when the children were not yet born, nor had done either good or evil, that the purpose of God according to his choice might abide, not on account of works, but of Him that calleth,) it was said to her, the elder shall serve the younger:
045	ROM	009	012	as it is written,
045	ROM	009	013	"I loved Jacob and I hated Esau."
045	ROM	009	014	What shall we say then? Is there injustice in God?
045	ROM	009	015	God forbid! For He saith to Moses, "I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion."
045	ROM	009	016	So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.
045	ROM	009	017	And the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, for this very purpose have I raised thee up, that I may shew forth my power in thee, and that my name may be declared through all the earth.
045	ROM	009	018	So then He hath mercy on whom He pleaseth, and whom He will, He hardeneth.
045	ROM	009	019	Thou wilt say then, Why doth he yet blame us? who hath resisted his will?
045	ROM	009	020	Nay but, O man, who art thou, that disputest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why didst thou make me thus?
045	ROM	009	021	Hath not the potter power over the clay, out of the same mass to make one vessel to honor and another to dishonor?
045	ROM	009	022	And what if God, though resolved to shew his displeasure at last, and to make known his power, yet bore with much long-suffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction?
045	ROM	009	023	and that He might make known the riches of his glory in the vessels of mercy, which He hath prepared for glory?
045	ROM	009	024	whom He hath also called, even us, not only of the Jews, but also of the Gentiles.
045	ROM	009	025	As He saith also in Hosea, I will call them my people, who were not my people, and her beloved, who was not beloved.
045	ROM	009	026	And in the place where it was said to them, Ye are not my people, there shall they be called the children of the living God.
045	ROM	009	027	And Esaias crieth out concerning Israel, Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, only a remnant shall be saved.
045	ROM	009	028	For in finishing the account and cutting it short in righteousness, the Lord will make a short work upon the earth.
045	ROM	009	029	And as Esaias said before, "Except the Lord of hosts had left us a seed, we had been as Sodom, and we had been made like unto Gomorrah."
045	ROM	009	030	What shall we say then? that the Gentiles, who sought not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is by faith;
045	ROM	009	031	but Israel, who followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness: why?
045	ROM	009	032	because they sought it not by faith, but by the works of the law, for they stumbled at that stumbling-stone;
045	ROM	009	033	as it is written, "Behold I lay in Sion a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence:" and again, "Whosoever believeth on Him shall not be ashamed."
045	ROM	010	001	Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is that they may be saved.
045	ROM	010	002	For I bear them witness that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge.
045	ROM	010	003	For being ignorant of the righteousness of God, and seeking to establish their own righteousness, they have not submitted themselves to the righteousness which is of God.
045	ROM	010	004	For Christ is the end of the law, for righteousness to every believer.
045	ROM	010	005	For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, "That the man who doth those things shall live by them."
045	ROM	010	006	But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh thus, "Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven, (that is, to bring Christ down) or,
045	ROM	010	007	who shall descend into the deep, (that is, to
045	ROM	010	008	bring up Christ from the dead)" but what saith it? "The word is nigh thee, in thy mouth and in thy heart." This is the word of faith which we preach: that if thou confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus,
045	ROM	010	009	and believe in thine heart, that God hath raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.
045	ROM	010	010	For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.
045	ROM	010	011	For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on Him, shall not be ashamed.
045	ROM	010	012	For there is no difference of Jew and Greek: for He being Lord of all is bountiful to all that call upon Him.
045	ROM	010	013	For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.
045	ROM	010	014	But how shall they call upon him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe on him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?
045	ROM	010	015	and how shall they preach unless they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of those who bring the good tidings of peace, who bring the good tidings of good things?
045	ROM	010	016	But all have not obeyed the gospel: for Esaias saith, "Lord, who hath believed our report?"
045	ROM	010	017	So that faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.
045	ROM	010	018	But I say, Have they not heard? Verily their sound is gone out into all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world.
045	ROM	010	019	But I say again, Did not Israel know this? when first Moses saith, "I will move you to jealousy by those who are not a people, I will provoke you to anger by a foolish nation:"
045	ROM	010	020	and Esaias positively affirms, "I was found of them that sought me not, I was made manifest to them that asked not after me:"
045	ROM	010	021	and saith to Israel, "All the day long have I stretched out my hands to a disobedient and gainsaying people."
045	ROM	011	001	I say then, Hath God cast off his people? God forbid! for I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.
045	ROM	011	002	God hath not cast off his people, whom He foreknew. Do ye not know what the scripture saith of Elias? how he complains to God against Israel,
045	ROM	011	003	saying, "Lord, they have slain thy prophets, and digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life."
045	ROM	011	004	But what saith the oracle of God to him? "I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to Baal."
045	ROM	011	005	And so in the present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.
045	ROM	011	006	And if by grace, it is no more of works: for then grace is no longer grace. But if of works, it is no more grace: for then work is no longer work.
045	ROM	011	007	What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he sought: but the elect have obtained it, and the rest were blinded,
045	ROM	011	008	(according as it is written, God hath given them a spirit of slumber, that their eyes could not see and their ears could not hear,) even unto this day.
045	ROM	011	009	And David saith, Let their table become a snare, and a trap, and a stumbling-block, and a recompence unto them.
045	ROM	011	010	Let their eyes be darkened that they may not see, and always bow down their back.
045	ROM	011	011	Say I then, Have they stumbled, that they should fall irrecoverably? God forbid! but this I say, that by their fall salvation is come to the Gentiles to excite them to emulation.
045	ROM	011	012	Now if their fall be the riches of the world, and their diminution be the riches of the Gentiles, how much more will their fulness be?
045	ROM	011	013	For I speak to you Gentiles: inasmuch indeed as I am the apostle of the Gentiles,
045	ROM	011	014	I extol my office, that if possible I may excite to emulation my brethren according to the flesh, and may save some of them:
045	ROM	011	015	for if the rejecting of them be the reconciling of the world, what will the receiving them again be but life from the dead?
045	ROM	011	016	Now if the first-fruits be holy, so is the whole heap: and if the root be holy, so are the branches.
045	ROM	011	017	But if some of the branches were broken off, and thou a wild-olive wert grafted in among them, and art made a partaker together with them of the root and fatness of the olive; boast not against the branches:
045	ROM	011	018	and if thou boastest, remember thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.
045	ROM	011	019	Wilt thou say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in?
045	ROM	011	020	Well; they were broken off for their infidelity, and thou standest by faith: therefore be not high-minded but fear.
045	ROM	011	021	For if God spared not the natural branches, neither would He spare thee.
045	ROM	011	022	Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: towards them that fell, severity; but towards thee, goodness; if thou continue in his goodness: for else thou also shalt be cut off.
045	ROM	011	023	And they, if they do not continue in unbelief, shall be grafted in: for God is able again to graft them in.
045	ROM	011	024	For if thou wert cut out of the wild olive, which was natural to thee, and contrary to nature were grafted into a good olive; how much more shall these who are the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive-tree?
045	ROM	011	025	For I would not have you, brethren, to be ignorant of this mystery, (least ye should be wise in your own eyes) that blindness in part is befallen Israel, till the fulness of the Gentiles be come in.
045	ROM	011	026	And so all Israel shall be saved, as it is written, "The deliverer shall come out of Sion, and shall turn away impiety from Jacob:
045	ROM	011	027	and this is my covenant with them, when I take away their sins."
045	ROM	011	028	As to the gospel indeed they are enemies on your account, but as to the election they are beloved on account of the fathers.
045	ROM	011	029	For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.
045	ROM	011	030	For as ye were heretofore disobedient to God, but have now obtained mercy in their disobedience:
045	ROM	011	031	so these also in your mercy have now been disobedient, that they themselves might be the objects of mercy.
045	ROM	011	032	For God hath included them all in the charge of disobedience, that He might have mercy upon all.
045	ROM	011	033	O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgements, and his ways not to be traced out!
045	ROM	011	034	For who hath known the mind of the Lord, or who hath been his counsellor?
045	ROM	011	035	Or who hath first given to Him? and it shall be returned.
045	ROM	011	036	For of Him, and through Him, and for Him, are all things. To Him be glory for ever. Amen.
045	ROM	012	001	I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, and well-pleasing to God, as your rational service.
045	ROM	012	002	And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may experience what is the good, and acceptable, and perfect will of God.
045	ROM	012	003	For by the grace conferred on me I charge every one among you, not to think of himself above what he ought to think: but to think with sobriety, according as God hath divided to every man the measure of faith.
045	ROM	012	004	For as in one body we have many members, and all the members have not the same office:
045	ROM	012	005	so we who are many, are one body in Christ, and every one members of each other.
045	ROM	012	006	But having different gifts, according to the grace conferred upon us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of our faith:
045	ROM	012	007	or ministry, let us attend to the ministry: or he that teacheth, on teaching: or he that exhorteth, on exhortation:
045	ROM	012	008	he that distributeth, let him do it with integrity: he that presideth, with diligence: he that sheweth mercy, with chearfulness.
045	ROM	012	009	Let love be unfeigned. Abhor that which is evil, cleave to that which is good;
045	ROM	012	010	be tenderly affected with brotherly love to each other, in honor preferring one another:
045	ROM	012	011	not slothful in business: fervent in spirit: serving the Lord.
045	ROM	012	012	Rejoicing in hope, patient under affliction, persevering in prayer,
045	ROM	012	013	communicating to the necessities of the saints, given to hospitality.
045	ROM	012	014	Bless them that persecute you: bless them, I say, and do not curse them.
045	ROM	012	015	Rejoice with those that rejoice, and weep with those that weep.
045	ROM	012	016	Be alike affected to each other: not aiming at high things, but accommodating yourselves to persons of low rank. Be not wise in your own conceit.
045	ROM	012	017	Render to no one evil for evil: behaving honorably in the sight of all men.
045	ROM	012	018	If it be possible, as much as ye can, live peaceably with all men.
045	ROM	012	019	Avenge not yourselves, my beloved; but rather give place to the wrath of others: for it is written, "Vengeance belongeth to me, I will recompence, saith the Lord."
045	ROM	012	020	Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing, thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.
045	ROM	012	021	Be not overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.
045	ROM	013	001	Let every soul be subject to the powers that are over them: for there is no such power but from God: the powers that are over men, are appointed by God.
045	ROM	013	002	So that he who resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive condemnation.
045	ROM	013	003	For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wouldest thou then not be afraid of the civil power? do what is good, and thou shalt have praise from it:
045	ROM	013	004	for he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou dost evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is also the minister of God, as an avenger to execute his wrath upon the malefactor.
045	ROM	013	005	Wherefore it is necessary to submit, not only on account of punishment, but also of conscience.
045	ROM	013	006	For you pay them tribute also for this reason; because they are God's ministers, continually attending hereunto.
045	ROM	013	007	Render therefore to all what is their due: tribute to whom tribute is due, custom to whom custom, reverence to whom reverence, honor to whom honor.
045	ROM	013	008	Owe no one any thing, but to love one another; for he that loveth others hath fulfilled the law:
045	ROM	013	009	for this command, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet, and every other social precept, is summed up in this, namely, "Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself."
045	ROM	013	010	Love worketh no evil to our neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.
045	ROM	013	011	And this let us observe, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep; for now is our salvation nearer than when we first believed.
045	ROM	013	012	The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light.
045	ROM	013	013	Let us behave decently as being in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in lewdness and lasciviousness, not in strife and envying.
045	ROM	013	014	But put on the Lord Jesus, and make not provision for the flesh to gratify its irregular desires.
045	ROM	014	001	Receive him that is weak in the faith, but not to disputes about doubtful matters:
045	ROM	014	002	for one believeth that he may eat any food; another, who is weak, liveth upon herbs.
045	ROM	014	003	Let not him, that eateth, despise him that eateth not; and let not him, that eateth not, censure him that eateth: for God hath received him.
045	ROM	014	004	Who art thou that judgest the servant of another? To his own master he standeth or falleth: yea, he shall be established; for God is able to establish him.
045	ROM	014	005	One preferreth some days to others; another esteemeth every day alike. Let every one be fully satisfied in his own mind.
045	ROM	014	006	He that regardeth a day regardeth it to the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, in deference to the Lord he doth not regard it. So he, that eateth all sorts of food, eateth to the Lord; for he giveth God thanks for it; and he that eateth not of some kinds of food, in deference to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks for the rest.
045	ROM	014	007	For none of us liveth to himself, and no one dieth to himself:
045	ROM	014	008	but if we live, we live to the Lord; and if we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's.
045	ROM	014	009	For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and lives again, that He might be Lord both of the dead and of the living.
045	ROM	014	010	But why dost thou censure thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? since we shall all stand before the tribunal of Christ;
045	ROM	014	011	for it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.
045	ROM	014	012	So that every one of us shall give an account of himself to God.
045	ROM	014	013	Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, not to lay a stumbling-block or scandal before a brother.
045	ROM	014	014	I know and have been taught by the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean of itself: only to him that thinketh any thing unclean, to him it is unclean.
045	ROM	014	015	But if thy brother be grieved by thy food, thou dost not herein walk in love. Do not by thy food destroy him, for whom Christ died.
045	ROM	014	016	Let not your liberty then be evil-spoken of: for the kingdom of God consists not in meat and drink;
045	ROM	014	017	but in righteousness and peace, and joy in the holy Ghost: for he,
045	ROM	014	018	that in these serveth Christ, is acceptable to God, and approved by men.
045	ROM	014	019	Let us then pursue peace, and mutual edification.
045	ROM	014	020	Do not for the sake of meat destroy thy brother who is the work of God: all things indeed are pure; but to the man that eateth with offence it is evil.
045	ROM	014	021	It is good not to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor to do any thing at which thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or weakened.
045	ROM	014	022	Thou who hast faith, have it to thyself before God: and happy is he that condemneth not himself in what he alloweth himself to do.
045	ROM	014	023	But he that hath any scruple, is condemned if he eat; because he doth it not with faith: and whatsoever is not of faith, is sin.
045	ROM	015	001	Now we that are strong, ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves:
045	ROM	015	002	but let every one of us please our neighbor for his good, to his edification.
045	ROM	015	003	For Christ also pleased not himself; but as it is written, "The reproaches of them that reproached thee, fell upon me."
045	ROM	015	004	For whatever things were written heretofore, were written for our instruction; that we through patience and the consolation of the scriptures might have hope.
045	ROM	015	005	And may the God of patience and consolation grant you the like mutual affection to each other, according to the example of Christ Jesus:
045	ROM	015	006	that with one mind and one mouth ye may glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
045	ROM	015	007	Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ hath received us, to the glory of God.
045	ROM	015	008	Now Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the manifestation of the truth of God, to confirm the promises made to the fathers:
045	ROM	015	009	and that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy, as it is written, "For this cause will I celebrate Thee among the Gentiles, and sing praises unto thy name."
045	ROM	015	010	And again he saith, "Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people."
045	ROM	015	011	And again, "Praise the Lord, all ye nations, praise Him, all ye people."
045	ROM	015	012	And again Esaias saith, "There shall be a root of Jesse, and one that shall rise to rule over the Gentiles: in Him shall the Gentiles trust."
045	ROM	015	013	Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope through the power of the holy Spirit.
045	ROM	015	014	And I myself am indeed persuaded concerning you, my brethren, that ye are full of goodness, being filled with all knowledge, and able to admonish one another.
045	ROM	015	015	However, I have written to you, brethren, somewhat the more freely, in reminding you of your duty; because of the favor bestowed upon me by God,
045	ROM	015	016	that I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, administring the gospel of God, that the offering of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the holy Spirit.
045	ROM	015	017	I have therefore matter of glorying in Christ Jesus, as to the things of God.
045	ROM	015	018	For I shall not go about to speak of any thing, but what Christ hath wrought by me, (to gain the obedience of the Gentiles,) both in word and deed:
045	ROM	015	019	through the efficacy of signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem, and round as far as to Illyricum, I have fully declared the gospel of Christ:
045	ROM	015	020	being studious however so to preach the gospel, not where Christ had been named, least I should build upon another man's foundation;
045	ROM	015	021	but as it is written, They, to whom nothing was said concerning Him, shall see, and they who have not heard, shall understand.
045	ROM	015	022	And thus I have been much hindered from coming to you:
045	ROM	015	023	but now having no more to detain me in these parts, and having had a great desire for many years to come to you, when I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you:
045	ROM	015	024	for I hope to see you as I pass by, and to be brought forward by you on my way thither, after I have first had some enjoyment of you.
045	ROM	015	025	But now I am going to Jerusalem to minister unto the saints.
045	ROM	015	026	For the Macedonians and Achaians have been pleased to make a contribution for the poor saints at Jerusalem.
045	ROM	015	027	It pleased them, I say, and they are indeed their debtors; for if the Gentiles have partook of their spiritual things, they ought also to be helpful to them in carnal ones.
045	ROM	015	028	Therefore when I have dispatched this, and sealed this fruit of love to them, I will come by you into Spain.
045	ROM	015	029	And I know that when I come unto you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.
045	ROM	015	030	Now I beseech you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the love of the Spirit, that ye earnestly strive together with me in prayers to God for me;
045	ROM	015	031	that I may be delivered from the unbelievers in Judea; and that this my service at Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints:
045	ROM	015	032	that I may come to you with joy, by the will of God, and may be refreshed with you.
045	ROM	015	033	Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.
045	ROM	016	001	I recommend to you Phebe, our sister, who is a servant of the church in Cenchrea:
045	ROM	016	002	that ye receive her in the Lord as becometh saints, and assist her in whatever affair she may have need of you; for she also hath been a helper of many others, as well as of myself.
045	ROM	016	003	Salute Priscilla and Aquila my fellow-laborers in Christ Jesus:
045	ROM	016	004	(who for my life exposed their own; to whom not I only give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles:)
045	ROM	016	005	and the church in their house. Salute my beloved Epenetus, who is the first-fruits of Achaia unto Christ.
045	ROM	016	006	Salute Mary, who took much pains on our account.
045	ROM	016	007	Salute Andronicus and Junias my kinsmen, and my fellow-prisoners, who are men of note among the apostles, and who were in Christ before me.
045	ROM	016	008	Salute Amplias my beloved in the Lord. Salute Urbanus, our fellow-laborer in Christ,
045	ROM	016	009	and my beloved Stachys.
045	ROM	016	010	Salute Apelles, a man approved in Christ.
045	ROM	016	011	Salute those of the family of Aristobulus. Salute Herodion my kinsman. Salute those of the family of Narcissus, who are in the Lord.
045	ROM	016	012	Salute Tryphena and Tryphosa, who are labouring in the Lord. Salute the beloved Persis, who hath laboured much in the Lord.
045	ROM	016	013	Salute Rufus chosen in the Lord, and his mother and even mine.
045	ROM	016	014	Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the brethren that are with them.
045	ROM	016	015	Salute Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints that are with them.
045	ROM	016	016	Salute one another with an holy kiss. The churches of Christ salute you.
045	ROM	016	017	Now I exhort you, brethren, to mark those who cause divisions and offences, contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned:
045	ROM	016	018	and avoid them; for such people serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by a soothing address and good words deceive the hearts of the innocent.
045	ROM	016	019	For your obedience is come to the knowledge of all: and therefore I rejoice on your account; but yet I would have you wise to that which is good, and simple as to that which is evil.
045	ROM	016	020	And the God of peace will soon bruise Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.
045	ROM	016	021	Timothy my fellow-laborer, and Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater, my kinsmen, salute you.
045	ROM	016	022	I Tertius, who wrote this epistle, salute you in the Lord.
045	ROM	016	023	Gaius my host, and that of the whole church saluteth you. Erastus, the chamberlain of the city, and our brother Quartus saluteth you.
045	ROM	016	024	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
045	ROM	016	025	Now to Him that is able to establish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, (conformable to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret in former times,
045	ROM	016	026	but is now manifested, and made known to all nations by the writings of the prophets, according to the appointment of the eternal God,
045	ROM	016	027	for the obedience of faith) to the only wise God be glory through Jesus Christ for ever. Amen.

# BOOK	046	1CO	1 Corinthians	1 Corinthians
046	1CO	001	001	Paul, called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother, to the church of God which is in Corinth,
046	1CO	001	002	even to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, and called to be saints, with all that in every place call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is both their Lord and ours;
046	1CO	001	003	grace and peace be to you from God our Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ.
046	1CO	001	004	I always give thanks unto my God, on your account, for the grace of God bestowed on you in Christ Jesus; that ye are enriched by Him with every gift,
046	1CO	001	005	in all utterance and knowledge;
046	1CO	001	006	(even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed among you;)
046	1CO	001	007	so that ye are deficient in no gift, expecting the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ:
046	1CO	001	008	who will also confirm you unto the end, that ye may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ;
046	1CO	001	009	for God is faithful by whom ye were called into the communion of his son Jesus Christ our Lord.
046	1CO	001	010	Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye would all say alike, and that there may be no schisms among you, but that ye be perfectly united in the same mind and in the same judgement.
046	1CO	001	011	For I have been informed concerning you, my brethren, by some of Chloe's family, that there are contentions among you.
046	1CO	001	012	I mean, that each of you saith, as if of different parties, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, I of Cephas, and I of Christ.
046	1CO	001	013	Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized into the name of Paul?
046	1CO	001	014	I thank God that I baptized none of you, except Crispus and Gaius:
046	1CO	001	015	so that no one can say I baptized in my own name.
046	1CO	001	016	I also baptized indeed the family of Stephanas: but I know not whether I baptized any other.
046	1CO	001	017	For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not in fine speech, least the cross of Christ should be made of no effect.
046	1CO	001	018	For the doctrine of the cross is to them, that perish, foolishness: but to us, who are saved, it is the power of God.
046	1CO	001	019	For it is written, "I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent."
046	1CO	001	020	Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputant of the age? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?
046	1CO	001	021	For, since in the wisdom of God the world by it's wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by what they called the folly of preaching to save those that believe.
046	1CO	001	022	And whereas the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks look for wisdom, we preach Christ crucified;
046	1CO	001	023	to the Jews indeed a stumbling-block, and to the Greeks foolishness; but to them that are called,
046	1CO	001	024	both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.
046	1CO	001	025	Because the foolishness of God, as they call it, is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.
046	1CO	001	026	For ye see by your calling, brethren, that not many wise men according to the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble are called:
046	1CO	001	027	but God hath chosen things that are foolish in the eye of the world to put it's wise men to confusion; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the mighty;
046	1CO	001	028	and things in the opinion of the world ignoble, and despicable, and accounted as nothing, hath God chosen, to abolish things that are in esteem among men;
046	1CO	001	029	that no flesh may glory in his presence.
046	1CO	001	030	But ye are of Him in Christ Jesus, who from God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:
046	1CO	001	031	that, as it is written, He that glorieth may glory in the Lord.
046	1CO	002	001	And I, when I came among you, brethren, came not with excellency of language, or of human wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God:
046	1CO	002	002	for I did not think it meet to know any thing among you, but Jesus Christ, and Him crucified.
046	1CO	002	003	And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.
046	1CO	002	004	And my discourse, and my preaching was not with the persuasive words of human wisdom, but in the demonstration of the Spirit and of power;
046	1CO	002	005	that your faith might not be in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.
046	1CO	002	006	Yet we speak true wisdom among the perfect: though not the wisdom of this world, nor of the rulers of this world, who come to nought.
046	1CO	002	007	But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, that hidden wisdom which God ordained before the worlds for our glory:
046	1CO	002	008	which none of the rulers of this age knew; for if they had known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.
046	1CO	002	009	But as it is written, "Eye hath not seen, and ear hath not heard, nor have entered into the heart of man, what things God hath prepared for those that love Him."
046	1CO	002	010	But God hath revealed them to us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, even the deep things of God.
046	1CO	002	011	For who among men knoweth the things of a man, but the spirit of a man which is in him? so also the things of God no one knoweth, but the Spirit of God.
046	1CO	002	012	Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit of God; that we might know the things that are graciously bestowed upon us by God:
046	1CO	002	013	which we also speak of, not in words dictated by human wisdom, but in those which are dictated by the holy Spirit; explaining spiritual things by spiritual words.
046	1CO	002	014	But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness to him; and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned.
046	1CO	002	015	Whereas the spiritual man discerneth all things, yet is himself discerned by no one.
046	1CO	002	016	For who hath known the mind of the Lord, to instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.
046	1CO	003	001	And I, my brethren, could not speak to you, as to spiritual persons, but as to carnal ones, even as to babes in Christ.
046	1CO	003	002	I have fed you with milk, and not with meat; for ye were not hitherto able to bear it, nor yet are ye even now able.
046	1CO	003	003	Because ye are still carnal: for while there is among you envy and strife and divisions, are ye not carnal, and do ye not walk as men?
046	1CO	003	004	For when one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos, are ye not carnal?
046	1CO	003	005	Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whose means ye embraced the faith, even as the Lord gave success to each of them?
046	1CO	003	006	I have planted, Apollos watered: but God gave the increase.
046	1CO	003	007	So that neither he that planteth is any thing, nor he that watereth, but God that giveth the increase.
046	1CO	003	008	And he that planteth, and he that watereth, are as one: but each shall receive his own reward according to his own labor.
046	1CO	003	009	For we are fellow-laborers, the servants of God: and ye are the husbandry of God, ye are the building of God.
046	1CO	003	010	According to the grace of God given to me, as a wise architect I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon: but let every one see to it how he buildeth thereon.
046	1CO	003	011	For no one can lay any other foundation, but that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ: and if any build upon this foundation gold,
046	1CO	003	012	silver, precious stones, or wood, hay, stubble;
046	1CO	003	013	every man's work shall be made manifest. For the great day will shew it; because it will be discovered by fire, and the fire will prove every man's work of what sort it is.
046	1CO	003	014	If any man's work abide, which he hath built upon it, he shall receive a reward:
046	1CO	003	015	but if any man's work be burnt, he will be damaged; though he himself shall be saved, but, as it were out of fire.
046	1CO	003	016	Do ye not know that ye are the temple of God, and the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?
046	1CO	003	017	If any one destroy the temple of God, him will God destroy: for the temple of God is holy, and this temple are ye.
046	1CO	003	018	Let no one deceive himself: if any among you seem to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be truly wise.
046	1CO	003	019	For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God; for it is written, "He taketh the wise in their own craftiness:"
046	1CO	003	020	and again, "The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain."
046	1CO	003	021	Therefore let no one glory in men: for all things are yours;
046	1CO	003	022	whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or future, all are yours;
046	1CO	003	023	and ye are Christ's; and Christ is God's.
046	1CO	004	001	Let a man so account of us, as the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.
046	1CO	004	002	Now it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.
046	1CO	004	003	But to me it is of very small moment to be judged by you, or by any man's judgement; nor indeed do I judge myself:
046	1CO	004	004	(for I am conscious to myself of nothing; though I am not hereby justified;) but He that judgeth me is the Lord.
046	1CO	004	005	Wherefore judge nothing before the time; even until the Lord come, who will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every one have praise from God.
046	1CO	004	006	These things, my brethren, I have by a figure transferred to myself, and Apollos, for your sakes, that ye may learn in us not to be wise above what is written, that ye may not be puffed up for one against another.
046	1CO	004	007	For who maketh thee to differ? and what hast thou, which thou didst not receive? And if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory as if thou hadst not received it?
046	1CO	004	008	Ye are now full, ye are now rich, ye have reigned as kings without us: and I wish ye did reign, that we also might reign with you.
046	1CO	004	009	For it seems to me that God hath as it were exhibited us the apostles last upon the stage as appointed to death; for we are made a spectacle to the world, and to angels and to men.
046	1CO	004	010	We are fools for Christ's sake, but ye are wise in Christ: we are weak, but ye are strong: ye are honoured, but we are despised.
046	1CO	004	011	Even to this present time we suffer both hunger, and thirst, and nakedness, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwelling:
046	1CO	004	012	and we labour working with our own hands. When we are reviled, we bless: when persecuted, we bear it: when defamed, we intreat.
046	1CO	004	013	We are made as the filth of the world, and the refuse of all things to this day.
046	1CO	004	014	I do not write these things to shame you, but as my beloved children I admonish you:
046	1CO	004	015	for if ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet ye have not many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you by the gospel.
046	1CO	004	016	I beseech you therefore, be ye imitators of me.
046	1CO	004	017	For this end have I sent unto you Timothy, who is my beloved son and faithful in the Lord, who will bring to your remembrance my ways in Christ, how I teach every where in every church.
046	1CO	004	018	Now some are puffed up, as if I would not come to you.
046	1CO	004	019	But I will come to you soon, if the Lord please, and will know, not the speech of them that are puffed up, but the power:
046	1CO	004	020	for the kingdom of God consisteth not in speech, but in power.
046	1CO	004	021	What do ye chuse? that I should come to you with a rod? or in love, and in the spirit of meekness?
046	1CO	005	001	It is commonly reported that there is lewdness among you, and such lewdness as is not named even amongst the heathens, that one should have his father's wife.
046	1CO	005	002	And are ye puffed up, and have not rather grieved? that he who hath committed this fact might be expelled from among you?
046	1CO	005	003	For I indeed, absent in body, but present in spirit, have already, as if I were present, judged him who hath wrought this wickedness: in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
046	1CO	005	004	when ye are assembled together with my spirit, by the power, I say,
046	1CO	005	005	of our Lord Jesus Christ, to deliver such a one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus. Your boasting is not good.
046	1CO	005	006	Do ye not know that a little leaven leaveneth the whole mass?
046	1CO	005	007	Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new mass, without leaven. For our paschal lamb, even Christ, was slain for us.
046	1CO	005	008	Wherefore let us keep the feast, not with the old leaven, nor with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavening of sincerity and truth.
046	1CO	005	009	I wrote to you in an epistle, not to associate with whoremongers:
046	1CO	005	010	but I did not mean not at all with the whoremongers of this world, or the covetous, or rapacious, or idolaters: since ye must then go out of the world.
046	1CO	005	011	But now I have written to you, not to associate with him, if any one, that is called a brother, be a whoremonger, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or rapacious; with such a one no not to eat.
046	1CO	005	012	For what have I to do to judge those that are without? and do not ye judge those that are within?
046	1CO	005	013	But those who are without, God judgeth: and therefore put away the wicked one from among you.
046	1CO	006	001	Dare any of you, having a matter of complaint against another, try it before the unjust, and not before the saints?
046	1CO	006	002	Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? And if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy of judging the smallest controversies?
046	1CO	006	003	Know ye not that we shall judge angels? what! and not worthy of judging the affairs of this life?
046	1CO	006	004	Therefore if ye have controversies about the things of this life, do ye set them to judge, who are despised by the church?
046	1CO	006	005	I speak it to your shame. What! is there not one wise man among you, that is able to judge between his bretheren?
046	1CO	006	006	But one brother goeth to law with another, and this before infidels.
046	1CO	006	007	Now there is certainly a fault among you, that ye have law-suits with one another: why do ye not rather endure wrong? why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?
046	1CO	006	008	But ye do wrong and defraud, and that even your brethren.
046	1CO	006	009	What! know ye not that the unjust shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor the effeminate, nor sodomites, nor thieves,
046	1CO	006	010	nor the covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor rapacious persons, shall inherit the kingdom of God.
046	1CO	006	011	And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the spirit of our God.
046	1CO	006	012	All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be under the power of any:
046	1CO	006	013	meats are for the belly, and the belly for meats, but God will destroy both it and them. But the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.
046	1CO	006	014	And as God hath raised up the Lord, so will He raise up us by his power.
046	1CO	006	015	Know ye not that your bodies are members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them members of an harlot?
046	1CO	006	016	God forbid! What! know ye not that he who is joined to an harlot is one body with her? for these two, saith he, shall be one flesh.
046	1CO	006	017	And he that is joined to the Lord is one spirit.
046	1CO	006	018	Flee from whoredom. Every other sin, that a man committeth, is without the body; but he, that committeth whoredom, sinneth against his own body.
046	1CO	006	019	What! know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost, which is in you, which ye have from God?
046	1CO	006	020	and ye are not your own, for ye are bought with a price. Glorify God therefore in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.
046	1CO	007	001	Now as to the things concerning which ye wrote to me: it were good for a man not to touch a woman.
046	1CO	007	002	Nevertheless to prevent whoredoms, let every one have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.
046	1CO	007	003	Let the husband render to the wife due benevolence; and in like manner also the wife to the husband.
046	1CO	007	004	The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband; and in like manner also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife.
046	1CO	007	005	Do not withdraw from one another, unless by consent for a season, that ye may attend to fasting and prayer: and come together again, least Satan tempt you through your incontinency.
046	1CO	007	006	But I say this by way of permission, not of command:
046	1CO	007	007	for I could wish that all men were as I myself am; but every man hath his proper gift from God, one of one kind and another of another?
046	1CO	007	008	Now to the unmarried and widows I say, it is good for them to continue so, as I do.
046	1CO	007	009	But if they have not the gift of continence, let them marry; for it is better to marry than to burn with lust.
046	1CO	007	010	But those that are married, not I command, but the Lord, that the wife be not separated from her husband;
046	1CO	007	011	(but if she separate, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband;) and that the husband put not away his wife.
046	1CO	007	012	But to the rest say I, not the Lord, If any brother has an unbelieving wife, and she like to dwell with him, let him not put her away.
046	1CO	007	013	And if any wife hath an unbelieving husband, and he like to dwell with her, let her not leave him.
046	1CO	007	014	For the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the husband: else were your children unclean; but they are holy.
046	1CO	007	015	But if the unbeliever depart, let them depart; a brother or a sister is not bound in such cases.
046	1CO	007	016	But God hath called us to peace; for how knowest thou, O wife, but thou shalt save thy husband; or how knowest thou, O husband, but thou shalt save thy wife?
046	1CO	007	017	However, as God hath distributed to every man, and as the Lord hath called every one, so let him walk: and thus I order in all the churches.
046	1CO	007	018	Is any one called that is circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised: is any one called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised: for circumcision is nothing,
046	1CO	007	019	and uncircumcision is nothing, but keeping the commandments of God.
046	1CO	007	020	In the calling in which every one was called, let him continue.
046	1CO	007	021	Wast thou called being a slave, be not anxious about it; but if thou canst be made free, prefer it.
046	1CO	007	022	For he that is called in the Lord being a slave, is the Lord's freed-man: and he likewise that is called being free is the servant of Christ.
046	1CO	007	023	Ye are bought with a price, do not become the slaves of men.
046	1CO	007	024	Brethren, in whatever condition every one was when called, let him abide therein with God.
046	1CO	007	025	But concerning single persons I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgement as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.
046	1CO	007	026	I think then, that it is---better on account of the present distress, ---that it is better, I say,
046	1CO	007	027	for a single man to be so. Art thou bound to a wife indeed? seek not to be loosed: but art thou loosed from a wife? seek not a wife.
046	1CO	007	028	Though, if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned: such however will probably have more trouble in life: but I spare you.
046	1CO	007	029	But this I say, brethren, that the time is short: it remains therefore, that even those, who have wives, be as though they had none;
046	1CO	007	030	and they, that weep, as if they wept not; and they, that rejoice, as if they rejoiced not; and they, that buy, as if they possessed not;
046	1CO	007	031	and they, that use this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion of this world passeth away.
046	1CO	007	032	And I would have you without anxiety. Now he, that is unmarried, careth for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord; but he,
046	1CO	007	033	that is married, is in care about the things of the world, and how he may please his wife.
046	1CO	007	034	There is a difference also between a wife and a virgin: she, that is unmarried, careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and spirit; but she, that is married, is in care about the things of the world, and how she may please her husband.
046	1CO	007	035	And this I say for your own benefit, not that I may cast a snare upon you, but in order to recommend that which is fit and becoming before the Lord without distraction.
046	1CO	007	036	But if any one think that he acts unbecomingly towards his virgin, if she pass the flower of her age, and that it ought to be so, let him do what he will; he doth not sin: let them marry.
046	1CO	007	037	But he, that is stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath determined in his heart that he will keep his virgin, doth well.
046	1CO	007	038	So that he, who giveth her in marriage, doth well; but he, that giveth her not in marriage, doth better.
046	1CO	007	039	The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth: but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will, only in the Lord:
046	1CO	007	040	but she is happier, in my opinion, if she continue as she is: and I think I have the Spirit of God.
046	1CO	008	001	Now as to things offered to idols, we know that we all have knowledge about them. Knowledge however puffeth up, but charity edifieth.
046	1CO	008	002	And if any one be conceited of his knowledge, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know.
046	1CO	008	003	But if any man love God, he is owned by Him.
046	1CO	008	004	As to the eating therefore of things sacrificed to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no other God but one.
046	1CO	008	005	For though there be some that are called Gods, whether in heaven or on earth, (as there are among the heathen gods many,
046	1CO	008	006	and lords many,) yet to us there is but one God the Father, from whom are all things, and we in Him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by Him.
046	1CO	008	007	But there is not in all men this knowledge: and some with a consciousness of the idol unto this day, eat it as a thing sacrificed to an idol, and so their conscience being weak is defiled.
046	1CO	008	008	But meat does not recommend us to God; for neither, if we eat, are we the better; nor the worse, if we eat not.
046	1CO	008	009	But see that this liberty of yours be not by any means a stumbling-block to the weak.
046	1CO	008	010	For if any one see thee, who hast knowledge, at table in an idol's temple, will not the conscience of him that is weak be encouraged to eat of the things sacrificed to idols?
046	1CO	008	011	and so the weak brother, for whom Christ died, shall perish by thy knowledge?
046	1CO	008	012	But in thus sinning against your brethren, and wounding their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ:
046	1CO	008	013	wherefore if meat make my brother to offend, I will never eat flesh while I breathe, least I make my brother to offend.
046	1CO	009	001	Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? and are not ye my work in the Lord?
046	1CO	009	002	If I am not an apostle to others, yet doubtless I am to you: for ye are in the Lord the seal of my apostleship.
046	1CO	009	003	And this is my answer to them that call me to account: have we not power to eat and to drink?
046	1CO	009	004	have
046	1CO	009	005	we not power to lead about with us a sister a wife as well as other apostles, and the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?
046	1CO	009	006	Or is it I only and Barnabas, that have not power to forbear working?
046	1CO	009	007	Who ever goes a warfare at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and doth not eat of the fruit of it? or who feedeth a flock, and doth not eat of the milk of the flock?
046	1CO	009	008	Do I speak these things as a man only?
046	1CO	009	009	or saith not the law the same also? for it is written in the law of Moses, "Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn." Now doth God take care for oxen,
046	1CO	009	010	or doth He say this indeed for our sakes? For it is certainly written for our sakes, that he, who ploweth, might plow in hope; and that he, who thresheth in hope, should partake of his hope.
046	1CO	009	011	If we then have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great matter if we reap your carnal things?
046	1CO	009	012	If others partake of this power over you, may not we rather? though we have not used this power; but we bear all things, least we should cause any hindrance to the gospel of Christ.
046	1CO	009	013	Do ye not know, that they who are employed about the sacrifices have their food from the temple? and they, who attend at the altar, are partakers with the altar?
046	1CO	009	014	So also the Lord hath ordained, that those who preach the Gospel should live of the Gospel.
046	1CO	009	015	But I have availed myself of none of these things. Nor have I written these things, that it might be so done as to me: for it were better for me to die, than that any one should make this my glorying void.
046	1CO	009	016	For if I preach the gospel, yet I have no ground for boasting; because I am under necessity to do it: and wo is me if I do not preach the Gospel.
046	1CO	009	017	Now if I do this willingly, I have a reward; and if unwillingly, yet I am intrusted with the commission, and I must execute it.
046	1CO	009	018	What is my reward then but this? that when I preach I may make the gospel of Christ not expensive, that so I may not abuse my power in the gospel.
046	1CO	009	019	For though I am free from all, yet I have made myself a servant to all, that I might gain the more.
046	1CO	009	020	And to the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; that is, to those, who are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain those who are under the law:
046	1CO	009	021	and to those without the law as without the law, (not being without law to God, but under the law to Christ) that I might gain those who are without the law.
046	1CO	009	022	To the weak I became as the weak, that I might gain the weak: I became all things to all men, that I might by every means save some.
046	1CO	009	023	And this I do for the sake of the gospel, that I may be a fellow partaker of it.
046	1CO	009	024	Know ye not, that those, who run in a race, do all indeed run, but one only receiveth the prize? So run that ye may obtain.
046	1CO	009	025	And every one that enters the lists is temperate in all things: they indeed do it that they may receive a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible one.
046	1CO	009	026	I therefore so run, not as unobserved: I so fight, not as one that beateth the air:
046	1CO	009	027	but I mortify my body and bring it into subjection, least after having preached to others, I myself should be rejected.
046	1CO	010	001	Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;
046	1CO	010	002	and were all baptized into Moses by the cloud and by the sea;
046	1CO	010	003	and did all eat the same spiritual food;
046	1CO	010	004	and did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of the spiritual rock that followed them: and that rock was an emblem of Christ.
046	1CO	010	005	But with the greater part of them God was displeased: for they were destroyed in the wilderness.
046	1CO	010	006	Now these things were examples for us, that we might not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.
046	1CO	010	007	And be ye not idolaters, as some of them were; as it is written, "The people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play."
046	1CO	010	008	Neither let us commit whoredom, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand.
046	1CO	010	009	Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted Him, and were destroyed by serpents: nor murmur,
046	1CO	010	010	as some of them also murmured, and were destroyed by the destroyer.
046	1CO	010	011	Now all these things happened to them as examples: and are written for our admonition, on whom the last ages are come.
046	1CO	010	012	Wherefore let him, that thinks he standeth, take heed least he fall.
046	1CO	010	013	No temptation has yet taken you but what is common to man: and God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above what ye are able to sustain; but will with the temptation also make a way of escape, that ye may be able to bear it.
046	1CO	010	014	Wherefore, my beloved brethren, flee from idolatry.
046	1CO	010	015	I speak to you as to men of understanding: and judge ye what I say,
046	1CO	010	016	---The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? the bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?
046	1CO	010	017	For the bread is one, and we though many are one body; for we all partake of that one bread.
046	1CO	010	018	Consider Israel according to the flesh, Are not they, that eat of the sacrifices, partakers of the altar?
046	1CO	010	019	What say I then? that the idol is any thing, or that what is sacrificed to an idol is in itself any thing to stumble at?
046	1CO	010	020	No: but this I say, that what the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons, and not to God.
046	1CO	010	021	And I would not have you partakers with demons. Ye cannot drink of the cup of the Lord, and the cup of demons: ye cannot be partakers of the table of the Lord, and of the table of demons.
046	1CO	010	022	Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than He?
046	1CO	010	023	If all things be lawful for me, yet all things are not expedient: all things may be lawful for me, but all things do not edify.
046	1CO	010	024	Let no one seek his own only, but every one another's benefit.
046	1CO	010	025	Eat then whatever is sold in the shambles, asking no questions for conscience sake:
046	1CO	010	026	for the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof:
046	1CO	010	027	and if any of the unbelievers invite you to an entertainment, and ye have a mind to go, whatever is set before you, eat, asking no questions for conscience-sake.
046	1CO	010	028	But if any one say to you, This hath been sacrificed to an idol, ---eat it not; for his sake who informed thee, and for conscience-sake: for, as I said, the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof, so that thou mayst have food enough without it.
046	1CO	010	029	Conscience I say, not thy own, but the other's; for why is my liberty to be judged by another man's conscience?
046	1CO	010	030	And if I partake with thankfulness, why am I blamed for that, for which I give thanks?
046	1CO	010	031	Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.
046	1CO	010	032	Behave inoffensively both to the Jews, and to the Greeks, and to the church of God.
046	1CO	010	033	Even as I also endeavour to please all men in all things, not seeking my own advantage, but that of many, that they may be saved.
046	1CO	011	001	Be ye then imitators of me, as I also am of Christ.
046	1CO	011	002	Now I commend you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you.
046	1CO	011	003	But I would have you know that Christ is the head of every man; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.
046	1CO	011	004	Every man praying or prophesying, having a veil on his head, dishonoureth Him who is his head.
046	1CO	011	005	But every woman praying or prophesying with her head unveiled dishonoureth man her head; for it is even all one as if she were shaved.
046	1CO	011	006	For if a woman be not covered, she may as well be shorn: but if it be shameful to a woman to be shorn or shaved, let her be covered.
046	1CO	011	007	For a man indeed ought not to have his head covered, he being the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.
046	1CO	011	008	For the man was not of the woman; but the woman was taken out of the man:
046	1CO	011	009	nor was the man created for the sake of the woman, but the woman for the man.
046	1CO	011	010	For this reason ought the woman to have power on her head, because of the angels.
046	1CO	011	011	Nevertheless, neither is the man without the woman, nor the woman without the man, in the Lord.
046	1CO	011	012	For as the woman was originally from the man, so also is the man by the woman: but all things are from God.
046	1CO	011	013	Judge in yourselves, Is it decent for a woman to pray to God uncovered?
046	1CO	011	014	Doth not even nature itself teach you, that if a man have long hair, it is a disgrace to him?
046	1CO	011	015	but if a woman have long hair it is a glory to her; because the hair was given her as for a veil.
046	1CO	011	016	But if any one is pleased to contend for the contrary, I answer, We have no such custom, nor any of the churches of God.
046	1CO	011	017	But whilst I am declaring this, I do not commend you, that ye assemble together not for the better, but for the worse.
046	1CO	011	018	For first when ye come together in the church, I hear there are divisions among you, and I partly believe it.
046	1CO	011	019	For there must be even heresies among you, that they who are approved may be made manifest among you.
046	1CO	011	020	When therefore ye thus assemble together, this is not eating the Lord's supper:
046	1CO	011	021	for in eating every one takes his own supper first; and one is hungry, and another is glutted.
046	1CO	011	022	What! have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or do ye despise the church of God, and shame those that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not.
046	1CO	011	023	For I received from the Lord, that which I also delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus the same night in which He was betrayed took bread:
046	1CO	011	024	and gave thanks, and brake it, and said, "Take and eat; this is my body, which is going to be broken for you: this do in remembrance of me."
046	1CO	011	025	And in the same manner He took the cup, after supper, saying, "This cup is the new covenant ratified in my blood: this do, as often as ye drink of it, in remembrance of me."
046	1CO	011	026	As often then as ye eat of this bread, and drink of this cup, ye commemorate the Lord's death till he come.
046	1CO	011	027	So that whosoever eateth this bread, or drinketh of the cup of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of profaning the body and blood of the Lord.
046	1CO	011	028	But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of this bread and drink of this cup:
046	1CO	011	029	for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh judgement against himself, not distinguishing the Lord's body.
046	1CO	011	030	For this many among you are weak and infirm, and several are fallen asleep.
046	1CO	011	031	If then we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged:
046	1CO	011	032	but when judged, we are chastened by the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.
046	1CO	011	033	Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, wait for one another:
046	1CO	011	034	and if any one be hungry, let him eat at home, that ye may not come together to your condemnation. And as to other things, I will set them in order when I come.
046	1CO	012	001	Now concerning spiritual gifts, my brethren, I would not have you ignorant.
046	1CO	012	002	Ye know that ye were Gentiles, drawn aside after dumb idols, just as ye were led: wherefore,
046	1CO	012	003	I must acquaint you, that no one speaking by the Spirit of God, calleth Jesus a curse: and no one can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the holy Ghost.
046	1CO	012	004	Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit: and there are different offices, but the same Lord:
046	1CO	012	005	and there are diversities of operations,
046	1CO	012	006	but it is the same God who worketh them all in every one.
046	1CO	012	007	But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the advantage of all.
046	1CO	012	008	For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;
046	1CO	012	009	to another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;
046	1CO	012	010	to another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another the discerning of spirits; to another various kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:
046	1CO	012	011	but all these worketh that one and the same Spirit distributing to every one in particular as He sees fit.
046	1CO	012	012	For as the body is one, and hath many members; but all the parts of this one body, though many, are but one body:
046	1CO	012	013	so also is the mystical body of Christ; for by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body, (whether Jews or Greeks, slaves or free) and are all made to drink into one Spirit:
046	1CO	012	014	for the body is not one member, but many.
046	1CO	012	015	If the foot should say, "Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body," is it therefore not of the body?
046	1CO	012	016	And if the ear should say, "Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body," is it therefore not of the body?
046	1CO	012	017	If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? and if the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?
046	1CO	012	018	But now God hath placed the members, every one of them in the body, as He pleased.
046	1CO	012	019	And if they were all one member, where were the body?
046	1CO	012	020	whereas now there are many members, yet but one body.
046	1CO	012	021	And the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of thee: or again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.
046	1CO	012	022	But those parts of the body, which seem to be weaker, are much more necessary:
046	1CO	012	023	and those which we judge the less honorable parts we clothe with more abundant honor; and so our less comely parts have more comeliness added to them, of which our comely ones have no need.
046	1CO	012	024	But God hath so blended the several parts of the body, giving greater honor to that which was deficient,
046	1CO	012	025	that there might be no schism in the body; but that all the members might have the same care one for another.
046	1CO	012	026	And so if one member suffer all the members suffer with it; and if one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.
046	1CO	012	027	Now ye are the body of Christ, and his members each of you in particular.
046	1CO	012	028	And God hath placed you accordingly in the church, first apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miraculous powers, then gifts of healing, helps, governments, and various kinds of tongues.
046	1CO	012	029	Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers?
046	1CO	012	030	have all miraculous powers? have all the gifts of healing? do all speak many languages? do all interpret? but ye are all zealous for the best gifts.
046	1CO	012	031	Though I will shew you a way yet more excellent.
046	1CO	013	001	For if I speak with the tongues of men and angels, and have not charity, I am but as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.
046	1CO	013	002	And though I have the gift of prophecy, and am acquainted with all mysteries, and all knowledge: yea if I have faith, even. to remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.
046	1CO	013	003	And though I give all my substance to feed the poor, and my body to be burnt, and have not charity, I am nothing profited.
046	1CO	013	004	Charity beareth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity is not insolent, is not puffed up,
046	1CO	013	005	doth not behave indecently, is not selfish, is not easily provoked,
046	1CO	013	006	suspecteth no evil, rejoiceth not at injustice, but rejoiceth in the truth:
046	1CO	013	007	covereth all faults, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.
046	1CO	013	008	Charity never faileth: but as to prophecies, they shall be abolished; or tongues, they shall cease; or knowledge, it shall be laid aside.
046	1CO	013	009	For now we know but in part, and we prophesy but in part.
046	1CO	013	010	But when that which is perfect shall come, then that which is defective shall be laid aside.
046	1CO	013	011	When I was a child, I spake as a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned as a child: but when I became a man, I laid aside childish things.
046	1CO	013	012	For we see now as through a mirror obscurely: but then we shall see face to face. Now I know but in part, but then I shall know even as I am known.
046	1CO	013	013	And now abideth faith, hope, love, these three graces; but the greatest of these is love.
046	1CO	014	001	Labour after charity, and be desirous of spiritual gifts: but especially that ye may prophesy.
046	1CO	014	002	For he, that speaketh in an unknown tongue, speaketh not to men, but to God: for no one understandeth, though in spirit he speaketh mysteries.
046	1CO	014	003	But he, that prophesieth, speaketh edification, and exhortation, and comfort to men.
046	1CO	014	004	He, that speaketh in an unknown tongue, edifieth himself: but he, that prophesieth, edifieth the church.
046	1CO	014	005	I could wish that ye all spake with tongues, but rather that ye prophesied: for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edification.
046	1CO	014	006	Now, my brethren, if I come to you speaking with many tongues, what shall I profit you, unless I speak intelligibly to you of revelation, or knowledge, or prophecy, or doctrine?
046	1CO	014	007	As inanimate things which give a found, whether pipe or harp, unless they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall what is piped or harped be understood?
046	1CO	014	008	For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who will prepare himself for the battle?
046	1CO	014	009	So also unless ye utter by the tongue intelligible words, how shall what is spoken be understood? for thus ye will be only talking to the wind.
046	1CO	014	010	There are, it may be, as many kinds of voices in the world as people, and none of them insignificant.
046	1CO	014	011	But if I know not the force of the words, I shall be to him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh will be a barbarian to me.
046	1CO	014	012	So ye also, since ye are so desirous of spiritual gifts, seek to abound in them to the edification of the church.
046	1CO	014	013	Wherefore let him, that speaketh in an unknown tongue, pray that he may interpret.
046	1CO	014	014	For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit indeed prayeth, but my meaning is fruitless.
046	1CO	014	015	What is then to be done? I will pray with the Spirit, but I will pray to be understood: I will sing with the spirit, but I will sing to be understood.
046	1CO	014	016	For if thou bless in the spirit, how shall the unlearned say Amen to thy thanksgiving, when he knoweth not what thou sayst?
046	1CO	014	017	thou indeed givest thanks well, but the other is not edified.
046	1CO	014	018	I thank God, I speak with tongues more than you all.
046	1CO	014	019	But in a public assembly I had rather speak five words to be understood, that I may instruct others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue.
046	1CO	014	020	My brethren, be not children in sense: but in malice be infants, and in your judgements shew yourselves to be men.
046	1CO	014	021	It is written in the law, "By men of another language, and by other lips, will I speak to this people, and even so they will not listen to me, saith the Lord."
046	1CO	014	022	So that tongues are for a sign, not to believers but to unbelievers: but prophecy not to unbelievers but to those that believe.
046	1CO	014	023	If then the whole church be come together and all speak in unknown tongues, and there come in illiterate persons, or infidels, will they not say that ye are mad?
046	1CO	014	024	But if all prophesy, and there come in an unbeliever, or one unlearned, he is convinced by all, he is judged by all.
046	1CO	014	025	And thus the secrets of his heart are made manifest; so that falling down upon his face he will worship God, declaring that God is indeed among you.
046	1CO	014	026	What is then to be done, my brethren? when ye come together, if any of you hath a psalm, a doctrine, a tongue, a revelation, an interpretation, ---let all be done for edification.
046	1CO	014	027	And if any one speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at most by three, and that by turns; and let one interpret.
046	1CO	014	028	But if there be no interpreter, let him be silent in the assembly; and let him speak to himself and to God.
046	1CO	014	029	And let but two or three of the prophets speak, and the others judge.
046	1CO	014	030	And if any thing be revealed to another sitting by, let the first have done speaking before the other begins.
046	1CO	014	031	For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted.
046	1CO	014	032	And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets:
046	1CO	014	033	for God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as we see in all the assemblies of the saints.
046	1CO	014	034	Let your women be silent in your assemblies: for it is not permitted to them to speak, but they are to be in subjection, as the law saith.
046	1CO	014	035	And if they would learn any thing, let them ask their own husbands at home; for it does not become women to speak in a public assembly.
046	1CO	014	036	Did the word of God come out first from you? or did it come to you only?
046	1CO	014	037	If any one seem to be a prophet, or acted by the Spirit, let him acknowlege that what I write to you are the commandments of the Lord.
046	1CO	014	038	But if any will be ignorant, let him be ignorant.
046	1CO	014	039	Wherefore, my brethren, be most desirous to prophesy, and yet forbid not to speak with tongues:
046	1CO	014	040	but let all things be done decently and in order.
046	1CO	015	001	Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached to you at first, which ye received, and wherein ye stand.
046	1CO	015	002	By which also ye are saved, if ye retain it as I preached it to you: unless indeed ye have believed in vain.
046	1CO	015	003	For in the first place I delivered to you, that which I also received, to wit, that Christ died for our sins, according to the scriptures:
046	1CO	015	004	and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day, according to the scriptures.
046	1CO	015	005	And that he was seen by Cephas, then by the twelve:
046	1CO	015	006	after that He appeared to above five hundred brethren at once, of whom the greater part remain yet alive, but some are fallen asleep.
046	1CO	015	007	Afterwards He was seen by James, then by all the apostles.
046	1CO	015	008	And last of all He appeared to me also, as one born out of due time: for I am the lest of the apostles,
046	1CO	015	009	not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.
046	1CO	015	010	But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his favor to me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all; yet not I, but the grace of God that was with me.
046	1CO	015	011	Whether therefore I or they laboured most, thus we preach, and thus ye believed.
046	1CO	015	012	Now if it be preached that Christ is risen from the dead, how say some among you, that there is no resurrection of the dead?
046	1CO	015	013	for if there be no resurrection of the dead, then Christ is not risen.
046	1CO	015	014	And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain.
046	1CO	015	015	Yea, and we are found false witnesses concerning God, for we have testified of God, that He raised up Christ; whom He did not raise up, if indeed the dead do not rise.
046	1CO	015	016	For if the dead rise not, then Christ is not raised:
046	1CO	015	017	and if Christ be not risen, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins.
046	1CO	015	018	Then they also that sleep in Christ, are perished.
046	1CO	015	019	If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.
046	1CO	015	020	But now Christ is risen from the dead, and is become the first-fruits of them that slept:
046	1CO	015	021	for as by man came death, by man cometh also the resurrection of the dead.
046	1CO	015	022	For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive.
046	1CO	015	023	But each in their proper order: the first-fruits, Christ; afterwards they that are Christ's, at his coming.
046	1CO	015	024	Then will be the end, when He shall have delivered up the kingdom to God even the Father; when He shall have abolished all rule, and all authority, and power.
046	1CO	015	025	For he must reign till He hath put all his enemies under his feet.
046	1CO	015	026	The last enemy that is destroyed is death:
046	1CO	015	027	for He hath put all things under his feet. But when He saith that all things are put under Him, it is plain that we are to except Him who put all things under Him.
046	1CO	015	028	And when all things shall be subjected to Him, then shall the Son also himself be subject to Him, that put all things under Him, that God may be all in all.
046	1CO	015	029	Besides, what shall they do who are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why then are they baptized for the dead?
046	1CO	015	030	And why are we in danger every hour?
046	1CO	015	031	I protest by your rejoicing, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, that I am even dying daily.
046	1CO	015	032	If, to speak as a man, I fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantage have I, if the dead rise not? Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die. ---
046	1CO	015	033	Be not deceived, bad conversations corrupt good morals.
046	1CO	015	034	Behave soberly, as ye ought to do, and sin not: for some of you have not the knowledge of God; to your shame I speak it.
046	1CO	015	035	But some will say, How are the dead raised, and with what body do they come?
046	1CO	015	036	Silly creature! that which thou sowest, is not quickened, except it die first.
046	1CO	015	037	And as to what thou sowest, thou sowest not the very body that shall be produced, but a bare grain, it may be, of wheat, or any other corn:
046	1CO	015	038	and God giveth it a body as He pleaseth, and to every one of the seeds it's own body.
046	1CO	015	039	All flesh is not the same kind of flesh: but there is one flesh of men, and another of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds.
046	1CO	015	040	There are also celestial bodies, and terrestrial bodies: but there is one glory of the celestial, and another of the terrestrial.
046	1CO	015	041	There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: and one star differeth from another star in glory.
046	1CO	015	042	So also will be the resurrection of the dead. Our body is sown in corruption, it is raised incorruptible: it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory:
046	1CO	015	043	it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power;
046	1CO	015	044	it is sown an animal body, it is raised a spiritual body: for there is an animal body, and there is a spiritual body.
046	1CO	015	045	And so it is written, "The first man Adam was made a living soul." But the last Adam is an enlivening spirit.
046	1CO	015	046	However, the spiritual is not first, but the animal; and afterwards the spiritual.
046	1CO	015	047	The first man being made out of the earth, was earthy: the second man is the Lord from heaven.
046	1CO	015	048	Such as the earthy was, such are they also that are earthy: and such, as is the heavenly, are they also that are heavenly.
046	1CO	015	049	And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.
046	1CO	015	050	But this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; nor doth what is corruptible inherit incorruption.
046	1CO	015	051	Behold, I tell you a mystery: we shall not all sleep; but we shall all be changed in a moment,
046	1CO	015	052	in the twinkling of an eye, at the sound of the last trumpet (for the trumpet shall sound) and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed:
046	1CO	015	053	for this corruptible body must put on incorruption, and this mortal body must be clothed with immortality.
046	1CO	015	054	And when this corruptible shall be clothed with incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall come to pass the word that is written, "Death is swallowed up in victory."
046	1CO	015	055	O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?
046	1CO	015	056	the sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law:
046	1CO	015	057	but thanks be to God, who giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
046	1CO	015	058	Wherefore, my beloved brethren, be stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, since ye know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.
046	1CO	016	001	Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I directed the churches of Galatia, so also do ye.
046	1CO	016	002	Upon the first day of the week let every one of you set apart something, putting it into the treasury, according as he is prospered: that there may be no need of collections, when I come.
046	1CO	016	003	And when I am with you, whomsoever ye shall approve, I will send, with your letters, to carry your bounty to Jerusalem.
046	1CO	016	004	And if it be requisite for me to go also, they shall go with me.
046	1CO	016	005	I will come to you, when I have passed through Macedonia; for I am to pass through Macedonia.
046	1CO	016	006	And perhaps I shall stay a while, or even pass the winter with you; that ye may forward me on my journey, whithersoever I go.
046	1CO	016	007	For I do not intend to see you now in my way, as I hope to stay some time with you, if the Lord permit.
046	1CO	016	008	But I shall stay at Ephesus till Pentecost. For a great and effectual door is opened to me,
046	1CO	016	009	though there are many opposers.
046	1CO	016	010	If Timothy should come, see that he be with you without fear: for he is employed in the work of the Lord, as I also am.
046	1CO	016	011	Let no one therefore despise him: but forward him on his journey in peace, that he may come to me; for I expect him with the brethren. As to our brother Apollos,
046	1CO	016	012	I much importuned him to come to you with the brethren: but he was not at all willing to come now; though he will come when he has a favorable opportunity.
046	1CO	016	013	Be watchful, stand fast in the faith, behave like men, be strong:
046	1CO	016	014	and let all your affairs be carried on in love.
046	1CO	016	015	I beseech you, brethren, (for ye know the family of Stephanas, that they are the first-fruits of Achaia, and
046	1CO	016	016	have set themselves to minister to the saints) that you also would be subservient to such, and to every one that worketh and laboureth with us.
046	1CO	016	017	I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas, and Fortunatus, and Achaicus: for what was wanting in you, they have made up.
046	1CO	016	018	For they have refreshed my spirit as well as yours: have a due regard therefore to such worthy persons.
046	1CO	016	019	The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla, with the church in their house, salute you in the Lord with much affection:
046	1CO	016	020	yea all the brethren salute you. Salute one another with an holy kiss.
046	1CO	016	021	The salutation of me Paul I write with my own hand.
046	1CO	016	022	If any one love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be made a curse.
046	1CO	016	023	Maran-atha. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
046	1CO	016	024	My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.

047	2CO	001	001	Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, to the church of God which is at Corinth, and all the saints that are in Achaia:
047	2CO	001	002	grace be to you, and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
047	2CO	001	003	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and God of all consolation; who comforteth us in all our affliction,
047	2CO	001	004	that we may be able to comfort those, that are in any trouble, by the consolation wherewith we ourselves are comforted by God.
047	2CO	001	005	For as the sufferings for the sake of Christ abound on us, so our consolation by Christ doth also abound.
047	2CO	001	006	And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation, which is wrought out by the patient enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer: or if we be comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation.
047	2CO	001	007	And our hope is firm concerning you, knowing that as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so also of the consolation.
047	2CO	001	008	For we would not have you ignorant, brethren, concerning our affliction which befel us in Asia, that we were exceedingly pressed above our strength, so that we despaired even of life:
047	2CO	001	009	but we had the sentence of death within ourselves, that we might not trust in ourselves, but in God who raiseth the dead:
047	2CO	001	010	who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver, in whom we trust that He will yet deliver us:
047	2CO	001	011	you also assisting by prayer for us, that the favor obtained for us by the prayers of many might be thankfully acknowledged by many on our account.
047	2CO	001	012	For this is our rejoicing, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and pious sincerity, not with carnal wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and especially towards you.
047	2CO	001	013	For we write no other things to you, but what ye own and acknowledge, and I hope ye will always acknowledge.
047	2CO	001	014	As ye have acknowledged us in part, that we are your boasting, as ye also are ours, in the day of the Lord Jesus.
047	2CO	001	015	And in this confidence I had a mind to come to you first, (that ye might have a second benefit,) and to pass by you into Macedonia;
047	2CO	001	016	and then to come to you again from Macedonia, and by you to be forwarded on my way to Judea.
047	2CO	001	017	Now when I intended this, was I chargeable with levity? or what I purpose, do I purpose from carnal motives, that with me there should be yea, yea, and then no, no?
047	2CO	001	018	But the faithful God, He knows, that our word to you was not yes and no.
047	2CO	001	019	For Jesus Christ the Son of God, who was preached among you by us, even by me, and Silvanus, and Timothy, was not yea and nay,
047	2CO	001	020	but was yea in Him, (for all the promises of God are in Him yea, and in Him amen,) to the glory of God by us:
047	2CO	001	021	but He that establisheth us as well as you in Christ, and hath anointed us, is God; who hath also sealed us,
047	2CO	001	022	and given us the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.
047	2CO	001	023	But I call God to witness on my soul, that to spare you I came not as yet to Corinth:
047	2CO	001	024	not that we are lords over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for by faith ye stand.
047	2CO	002	001	But I determined with myself, not to come to you again in grief:
047	2CO	002	002	for if I grieve you, who is it that maketh me glad, but he that is grieved by me?
047	2CO	002	003	And I wrote this to you, that when I come I may not have grief from those of whom I ought to receive joy, being persuaded concerning all of you, that my joy is the joy of you all.
047	2CO	002	004	For through much affliction and distress of heart I wrote to you with many tears; not that ye might be grieved, but that ye might know the love with which I abound towards you.
047	2CO	002	005	And if any one hath caused grief, it hath grieved me only as to part of you, (that I may not overcharge you
047	2CO	002	006	all) though sufficient to such a one is the censure passed on him by many.
047	2CO	002	007	So that on the contrary, ye ought rather to forgive and comfort him, least such a one should be swallowed up with excessive sorrow.
047	2CO	002	008	Wherefore I beseech you to confirm your love to him.
047	2CO	002	009	For to this end also did I write, that I might have proof of you, whether ye are obedient in all things.
047	2CO	002	010	And to whom ye forgive any thing, I also forgive it: for if I have forgiven any thing, I forgave it him, to whom I did forgive it, for your sakes, in the person of Christ; that we might not be foiled by Satan:
047	2CO	002	011	for we are not ignorant of his devices.
047	2CO	002	012	So that when I came to Troas on account of the gospel of Christ, and a door was opened to me in the Lord,
047	2CO	002	013	yet I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother there; but taking my leave of them, I went away into Macedonia.
047	2CO	002	014	But thanks be to God, who always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and spreadeth the odor of his knowledge by us in every place.
047	2CO	002	015	For we are the sweet odor of Christ unto God, in them that are saved, yea and in them that perish:
047	2CO	002	016	to these indeed we are an odor of death to death; to those an odor of life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things?
047	2CO	002	017	For we are not like many who adulterate the word of God: but as with sincerity, but as from God, and in the sight of God, we speak concerning Christ.
047	2CO	003	001	Do we begin again to recommend ourselves? or do we need, as some do, recommendatory epistles to you, or letters of recommendation from you?
047	2CO	003	002	Ye are our epistle, inscribed on our hearts, known and read by all men:
047	2CO	003	003	being manifest that ye are the epistle of Christ, through our ministration, written not with ink, but by the Spirit of the living God; not on tables of stone, but on tables of the heart of flesh.
047	2CO	003	004	And such confidence have we through Christ towards God:
047	2CO	003	005	not that we can of ourselves reckon upon any thing as from ourselves, but our sufficiency is from God.
047	2CO	003	006	Who hath also fitted us to be ministers of the new covenant, not of the letter, but of the Spirit: for the letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth life.
047	2CO	003	007	Now if the ministration of death which was in writing, and engraven on stones, was so glorious that the children of Israel could not look stedfastly on the face of Moses, because of the lustre of his countenance, which was to be taken away:
047	2CO	003	008	shall not the ministration of the Spirit be more glorious?
047	2CO	003	009	For if the ministration of condemnation was so glorious, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory:
047	2CO	003	010	since what was then made glorious was not in comparison glorious, because of the glory that surpasseth it.
047	2CO	003	011	For if that, which was to be taken away, came with glory, much more that which abideth is glorious.
047	2CO	003	012	Having therefore such hope, we use much freedom of speech:
047	2CO	003	013	and do not as Moses, who put a veil upon his face, intimating that the children of Israel could not look to the end of that which was to be abolished; but their minds were blinded:
047	2CO	003	014	for unto this day the same veil remaineth unremoved in the reading of the old testament, which veil is taken away in Christ.
047	2CO	003	015	But to this day, when Moses is read, the veil is upon their heart.
047	2CO	003	016	Though when it turneth unto the Lord, the veil is taken off:
047	2CO	003	017	now the Lord is that Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.
047	2CO	003	018	But we all with unveiled face beholding, as in a glass, the glory of the Lord, are transformed according to the same image from glory to glory, as proceeding from the Spirit of the Lord.
047	2CO	004	001	Therefore having received this ministry, as we have obtained mercy, we are not disheartened:
047	2CO	004	002	but have rejected shameful disguises, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by the manifestation of the truth, recommending ourselves to every man's conscience, in the sight of God.
047	2CO	004	003	And if our gospel also be veiled, it is to those that perish;
047	2CO	004	004	among whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of the unbelieving, so that the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, doth not shine unto them:
047	2CO	004	005	for we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord, and ourselves your servants for the sake of Jesus.
047	2CO	004	006	For God, who commanded light to shine out of darkness, hath shined into our hearts, to reflect the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
047	2CO	004	007	But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellence of the power might be evidently of God, and not of us:
047	2CO	004	008	being afflicted on every side, but not oppressed; perplexed, but not in despair;
047	2CO	004	009	persecuted, but not forsaken;
047	2CO	004	010	cast down, but not destroyed; always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be manifested in our body.
047	2CO	004	011	For we, who are yet living, are always exposed to death for the sake of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh.
047	2CO	004	012	So that death is wrought in us, but life in you.
047	2CO	004	013	But having the same Spirit of faith, according to what is written, "I believed, and therefore have I spoken," we also believe, and therefore speak:
047	2CO	004	014	knowing that He, who raised up the Lord Jesus, will raise up us also by Jesus, and present us with you.
047	2CO	004	015	For all these things are for your sakes, that the abundant grace might through the gratitude of many redound to the glory of God.
047	2CO	004	016	For which cause we are not disheartened: but though our outward man decayeth, yet the inward man is renewed daily.
047	2CO	004	017	For our short and light affliction is working out for us an infinite and eternal weight of glory, as we aim not at the things which are visible, but invisible:
047	2CO	004	018	for those, which are visible, are temporary, but the invisible are eternal.
047	2CO	005	001	For we know that if our earthly house, which is but as a tent, were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.
047	2CO	005	002	And therefore whilst we are in this tabernacle we groan, being very desirous to be covered with our house which is from heaven: since though unclothed of this body,
047	2CO	005	003	yet we shall not be found naked.
047	2CO	005	004	For we who are in this tabernacle do groan, being burthened; wherefore we desire, not to be wholly unclothed, but to put on immortality, that the mortal part may be swallowed up in life.
047	2CO	005	005	Now He, that hath wrought us hereunto, is God; who hath also given us the earnest of the Spirit.
047	2CO	005	006	Therefore we are always confident, knowing that while we dwell in the body, we are absent from the Lord,
047	2CO	005	007	(for we walk by faith, not by sight,) we are confident, I say,
047	2CO	005	008	and well-pleased rather to be absent from the body, and to dwell with the Lord.
047	2CO	005	009	Wherefore we are also ambitious, whether dwelling in the body, or out of it, to be well-pleasing to Him.
047	2CO	005	010	For we must all appear before the tribunal of Christ, that every one may receive for the things done in the body, according to what he hath done, whether it were good or bad.
047	2CO	005	011	Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men: but if not, we are manifest unto God, and I hope we are also manifested to your consciences:
047	2CO	005	012	for we are not again recommending ourselves to you, but giving you an occasion of glorying on our account; that ye may have somewhat to answer those who glory in appearance, and not in heart.
047	2CO	005	013	For whether we be in extasies, it is to God: or if we be composed, it is for your benefit.
047	2CO	005	014	For the love of Christ constraineth us, being fully persuaded of this, that if One died for all, then were all dead.
047	2CO	005	015	And He died for all, that those who live might no longer live to themselves, but to Him who died for them and rose again.
047	2CO	005	016	Wherefore we henceforth know no one according to the flesh: and if we have known even Christ after the flesh, yet now we thus know Him no more.
047	2CO	005	017	And therefore if any one be in Christ, he is created anew: old things are passed away, behold all things are become new.
047	2CO	005	018	But all these things are from God, who hath reconciled us to Himself by Jesus Christ, and made us ministers of the reconciliation;
047	2CO	005	019	to declare, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, not imputing to them their trespasses, and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.
047	2CO	005	020	We are therefore ambassadors for Christ, and as God exhorteth you by us, we intreat you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God.
047	2CO	005	021	For He hath made Him, who knew no sin, to be a sin-offering for us, that in Him we might be made righteous before God.
047	2CO	006	001	And we co-operating with Him do also exhort you that ye receive not the grace of God in vain:
047	2CO	006	002	for He saith, "I have heard thee in an acceptable time, and in a day of salvation have I helped thee." Behold now is the acceptable time; behold now is the day of salvation.
047	2CO	006	003	We give no offence in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed:
047	2CO	006	004	but in every thing approving ourselves as the ministers of God; by much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in straits,
047	2CO	006	005	in stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in watchings, in fastings;
047	2CO	006	006	by purity, by knowledge, by long-suffering, by kindness, by the holy Spirit,
047	2CO	006	007	by love unfeigned, by the word of truth, by the power of God, with the armour of righteousness on the right and on the left; through honor and dishonor,
047	2CO	006	008	through evil report and good report;
047	2CO	006	009	as deceivers, and yet true; as unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and behold we live; as chastened, but not put to death;
047	2CO	006	010	as sorrowing, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, yet possessing all things.
047	2CO	006	011	O Corinthians, our mouth is opened unto you, our heart is enlarged:
047	2CO	006	012	ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own bowels.
047	2CO	006	013	Now as a return of our love (I speak as to my children) be ye also enlarged towards us.
047	2CO	006	014	Be not unsuitably connected with infidels: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? or what communion hath light with darkness?
047	2CO	006	015	what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath a believer with an infidel?
047	2CO	006	016	and what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God: as God hath said, "I will dwell in them, and I will walk among them, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people."
047	2CO	006	017	Wherefore, "come out from the midst of them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch no unclean thing," and I will receive you:
047	2CO	006	018	and I will be a father unto you, and ye shall be to me for sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.
047	2CO	007	001	Having therefore, my beloved, these promises, let us purify ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.
047	2CO	007	002	Receive us---we have injured no man, we have corrupted no one, we have over-reached no one.
047	2CO	007	003	I speak not this to condemn you: for I said before that ye are so much in our hearts that we could live and die with you.
047	2CO	007	004	I use much freedom of speech to you, and I boast much of you: I am filled with comfort, and superabound in joy above all our affliction.
047	2CO	007	005	For when we came into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were afflicted on every side; without were fightings, within were fears.
047	2CO	007	006	But God, who comforteth those that are brought low, comforted us by the coming of Titus:
047	2CO	007	007	and not only by his coming, but especially by the consolation wherewith he was comforted on your account, acquainting us with your earnest desire towards us, your grief, and your zeal for me; so that I rejoiced greatly.
047	2CO	007	008	For though I grieved you by my letter, I do not repent, though I did repent; for I perceive that that epistle grieved you, though it was but for a little while.
047	2CO	007	009	However, now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to repentance; for ye were grieved after a godly manner, so that ye received no damage from us.
047	2CO	007	010	For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.
047	2CO	007	011	For behold this very thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly manner, what diligence it wrought in you! yea, what apology, what indignation, what fear, what earnest desire, what zeal, what revenge! by all which ye have shewn yourselves to be clear in the affair.
047	2CO	007	012	Wherefore if I wrote in such a manner to you, it was not merely on his account who had done the wrong, nor for his sake who had been injured; but that our care for you in the sight of God might be manifested among you.
047	2CO	007	013	We were therefore comforted by your consolation; and rejoiced the more at the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all;
047	2CO	007	014	and because if I boasted of any thing to him concerning you, I was not ashamed; but as we have spoken all things to you in truth, so likewise our boasting of you to Titus was truth.
047	2CO	007	015	And his bowels are exceedingly moved towards you, when he calls to mind the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye received him.
047	2CO	007	016	I rejoice therefore that in every thing I have confidence in you.
047	2CO	008	001	Now we make known to you, brethren, the grace of God conferred on the churches of Macedonia:
047	2CO	008	002	how in a great trial of affliction, their abundant chearfulness and their deep poverty, hath munificently shewn the riches of their bounty.
047	2CO	008	003	For to their power, I bear them witness, yea and beyond their power, they contributed of their own accord:
047	2CO	008	004	intreating us with much importunity, that we would convey the gift, and so take upon us a part of the ministration to the saints.
047	2CO	008	005	And this they did not merely as we hoped, but first gave themselves unto the Lord, and to us by the will of God.
047	2CO	008	006	Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had already begun, so he would also complete this grace among you.
047	2CO	008	007	And as ye abound in every other grace, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love to us, that ye may abound in this grace also.
047	2CO	008	008	I speak not by way of command, but to prove the sincerity of your love also, by means of the forwardness of others.
047	2CO	008	009	For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was rich, yet for your sakes He became poor, that ye by his poverty might be rich.
047	2CO	008	010	And herein I give my opinion: for this is to your advantage, who not only began to act, but also to be forward to it above a year ago.
047	2CO	008	011	Now therefore perfect also the doing it; that as there was a readiness of will, so there may be also a performance according to your ability.
047	2CO	008	012	For if there be first a willing mind, any me is accepted according to what he hath, not according to what he hath not.
047	2CO	008	013	For I do not mean that others should have relief, and you be burdened:
047	2CO	008	014	but by an equality, that your abundance may at this time be a supply to their want; and their abundance may be the like to your want, if need be: that there may be an equality:
047	2CO	008	015	as it is written, "He that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack."
047	2CO	008	016	But thanks be to God, who put the same concern for you into the heart of Titus:
047	2CO	008	017	for he not only complied with the exhortation, but being more forward he went to you of his own accord.
047	2CO	008	018	And we have sent along with him the brother, whose praise in the gospel is spread through all the churches:
047	2CO	008	019	(and not only so, but he was also chosen by the churches to accompany us with this grace, which is administered by us for the glory of the same Lord, and to shew your readiness of mind:)
047	2CO	008	020	hereby taking care that no one might blame us in the disposal of this large sum which is administered by us:
047	2CO	008	021	looking to things that are right not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.
047	2CO	008	022	And we have sent with them another brother of ours, whom we have often proved diligent in many things, and now I doubt not much more on account of his great confidence in you.
047	2CO	008	023	If then there be any inquiry about Titus, he is my collegue and fellow-laborer among you: and if our brethren be inquired after, they are the messengers of the churches, and the glory of Christ.
047	2CO	008	024	Therefore shew to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love, and the justness of our boasting concerning you.
047	2CO	009	001	Now concerning the relief intended for the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you:
047	2CO	009	002	for I know your readiness of mind, which I boast of concerning you to the Macedonians, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal hath excited many.
047	2CO	009	003	But I have sent the brethren, that our boasting of you might not become vain in this respect, but that ye might be ready, as I had said:
047	2CO	009	004	least if the Macedonians should come with me, and find you unprepared, we should be ashamed (not to say you also) in this confident boasting.
047	2CO	009	005	Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren to go first to you, and before our coming to collect your bounty beforementioned, that it may be ready, as of munificence, and not of force.
047	2CO	009	006	But this I say, He that soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he that soweth bountifully shall also reap bountifully.
047	2CO	009	007	Let every one give as he chuses in his own heart; not with reluctance, or constraint: for God loveth a chearful giver.
047	2CO	009	008	And God is able to make all grace abound towards you; that having always all sufficiency in every thing, ye may abound in every good work:
047	2CO	009	009	(as it is written, "He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor, his righteousness continueth for ever."
047	2CO	009	010	And may He, who supplieth seed to the sower, and giveth bread for food, furnish and multiply your sowing, and increase the fruits of your bounty:)
047	2CO	009	011	being in every thing enriched to all liberality, which produceth through us thanksgiving to God.
047	2CO	009	012	For the ministration of this service not only supplieth the wants of the saints, but aboundeth also, through many thanksgivings, to the glory of God.
047	2CO	009	013	(While from the experience of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection to the gospel of Christ, and the liberality of your communication to them, and to all men.)
047	2CO	009	014	And in their prayer for you, who long after you because of the transcendent grace of God towards you.
047	2CO	009	015	Thanks be to God for his inexpressible gift!
047	2CO	010	001	Now I Paul myself exhort you, by the meekness and lenity of Christ, who in presence am lowly among you,
047	2CO	010	002	but being absent am bold towards you, yea I intreat you, that I may not be bold, when I am present, with that confidence, wherewith I think to proceed against some, who censure us as walking after the flesh.
047	2CO	010	003	For though we are in the flesh, we do not carry on our war according to the flesh:
047	2CO	010	004	(for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the demolishing of bulwarks:)
047	2CO	010	005	destroying false reasonings, and every height that is exalted against the knowledge of God, and captivating every thought to the obedience of Christ.
047	2CO	010	006	And being prepared to avenge all disobedience, since your obedience is fulfilled.
047	2CO	010	007	Do ye look at things according to the outward appearance? If any one is confident in himself that he is Christ's, let him consider this again of himself, that as he is Christ's, so we also are Christ's.
047	2CO	010	008	For though I should boast yet more of our authority, (which the Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your destruction) I should not be ashamed:
047	2CO	010	009	that I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters;
047	2CO	010	010	for his letters, say they, are weighty and powerful, but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible.
047	2CO	010	011	But let such a one know this, that as we are in word by letters, when absent, such also shall we be in fact when present.
047	2CO	010	012	For we presume not to number, or compare ourselves with some who recommend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves with themselves, are void of understanding.
047	2CO	010	013	But we will not glory of things beyond our bounds, but according to the measure of the rule which God hath given to us, a measure to come even unto you.
047	2CO	010	014	For we do not stretch ourselves beyond measure, as though we were not commissioned to come unto you; for we have reached even to you also in preaching the gospel of Christ.
047	2CO	010	015	Not boasting of things beyond our limits in other men's labors; but having hope that, when your faith is increased, we shall be abundantly enlarged by you according to our line,
047	2CO	010	016	to preach the gospel in places beyond you; and not to boast in another's province of things ready prepared for us.
047	2CO	010	017	But let him, that glorieth, glory in the Lord.
047	2CO	010	018	For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but he whom the Lord commendeth.
047	2CO	011	001	I wish ye would bear with me a little in my folly; and indeed bear with me.
047	2CO	011	002	For I am jealous over you with a godly jealousy, having espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.
047	2CO	011	003	But I fear least as the serpent seduced Eve by his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the purity that is in Christ.
047	2CO	011	004	For if he, that cometh to you, preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached; or if ye receive another Spirit which ye have not received, or another gospel which ye have not embraced, ye might indeed bear with him.
047	2CO	011	005	For I think I was not inferior to the very chiefest apostles: and if I am unskilled in speech,
047	2CO	011	006	yet not in knowledge ---but we have been fully manifested among you in all things.
047	2CO	011	007	Have I committed an offence in humbling myself that ye might be exalted? and in that I have preached the gospel of God to you gratis?
047	2CO	011	008	I trespassed on other churches, receiving maintenance from them for your service.
047	2CO	011	009	And when I was present among you, and in want, I was chargeable to no one. For the brethren that came from Macedonia supplied my want: and in every thing I have kept myself from being burdensome to you, and so I will keep myself.
047	2CO	011	010	As the truth of Christ is in me, this boast shall not be taken from me in the regions of Achaia.
047	2CO	011	011	Wherefore? because I love you not?
047	2CO	011	012	God knoweth. But what I do, I will do, that I may cut off occasion from those that desire an occasion of boasting or censure, that in what they boast of they may be found to do even as we do.
047	2CO	011	013	For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transformed into apostles of Christ.
047	2CO	011	014	And no wonder: for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.
047	2CO	011	015	It is therefore no great thing, if his ministers also be transformed into ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.
047	2CO	011	016	I say again, let no one think me foolish herein; but if they do, yet bear with my weakness, that I also may boast a little.
047	2CO	011	017	What I speak I speak not as from the Lord, but as in weakness, in this confidence of boasting.
047	2CO	011	018	Since many boast in the flesh, I will boast also.
047	2CO	011	019	For ye bear with fools willingly, being yourselves so wise:
047	2CO	011	020	ye bear it, even if any one enslave you, if any devour you, if any take your substance, if any be lifted up, yea if any one smite you on the face.
047	2CO	011	021	I speak of their reproaches, as if we were weak: but whereinsoever any one may be confident (though I speak foolishly) I may be confident too.
047	2CO	011	022	Are they Hebrews? so am I: are they Israelites? so am I: are they the seed of Abraham?
047	2CO	011	023	so am I: are they ministers of Christ? (if I may speak as a fool) I am more: in labors more abundant, in stripes far exceeding, in prisons more frequently, and often even in deaths.
047	2CO	011	024	From the Jews I have five times received forty stripes save one.
047	2CO	011	025	Thrice I have been beaten with rods, once I was stoned, thrice I have been shipwrecked, and was a night and a day on the deep:
047	2CO	011	026	in journies often, in perils from rivers, in perils from robbers, in perils from my own nation, in perils from the heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the desert, in perils on the sea, in perils among false brethren:
047	2CO	011	027	in labor and toil, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness: and beside these outward troubles,
047	2CO	011	028	that which besets me daily, the care of all the churches.
047	2CO	011	029	Who is infirm, and I am not infirm also? who is offended, and I am not inflamed?
047	2CO	011	030	If I must boast, I will boast of the things which relate to my infirmity.
047	2CO	011	031	And the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is blessed for ever, knoweth that I lye not.
047	2CO	011	032	In Damascus the governor under king Aretas, placed guards about the city to seize me:
047	2CO	011	033	and I was let down by the wall through a window in a basket, and so escaped his hands.
047	2CO	012	001	To boast indeed does not become me: but I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.
047	2CO	012	002	I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago (whether in the body, or out of the body, I know not, God knoweth) such a one caught up to the third heaven.
047	2CO	012	003	And I know such a man (whether then in the body, or out of the body,
047	2CO	012	004	I know not, God knoweth) that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unutterable words, which it is not permitted unto man to speak.
047	2CO	012	005	Of such a one I will boast; but of myself I will not boast, unless in my infirmities.
047	2CO	012	006	For though I should incline to boast, I shall not be a fool; for I should speak truth. But I forbear least any one should think of me above what he seeth me to be, or heareth from me.
047	2CO	012	007	And least I should be too much lifted up with the abundance of the revelations, there was given me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to buffet me, least I should be too much elevated.
047	2CO	012	008	For this I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.
047	2CO	012	009	And He said unto me, "My grace is sufficient for thee: for my power is manifested in thy weakness." With the greatest pleasure therefore will I glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.
047	2CO	012	010	And therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, and in straits for the sake of Christ: for when I am thus weak, then am I made strong.
047	2CO	012	011	Am I become vain in boasting? ye have forced me to it: for I ought to have been recommended by you, as I have in nothing fallen short of the very chiefest of the apostles, though in myself I am nothing.
047	2CO	012	012	The marks indeed of an apostle have been shewn among you with all patience, by signs, and wonders, and miracles.
047	2CO	012	013	For what is it that ye were inferior in to the rest of the churches, unless it be that I myself was not burdensome to you?--- Forgive me this injury.
047	2CO	012	014	Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not be burdensome to you: for I seek not your substance, but your selves. For children are not expected to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.
047	2CO	012	015	And I will with the greatest pleasure spend and be spent for your souls; even though the more I love you, the less I should be loved.
047	2CO	012	016	Be it so, that I did not burden you myself, yet, may some say, being crafty I over-reached you by subtilty.
047	2CO	012	017	But did I make a gain of you by any of those whom I sent to you?
047	2CO	012	018	I desired Titus to come to you, and with him I sent a brother: did Titus make a gain of you? did we not walk in the same spirit? did we not tread in the same steps?
047	2CO	012	019	Do ye then think that we are making apologies to you? No, we speak before God in Christ: and all, my beloved, for your edification.
047	2CO	012	020	For I am afraid least when I come, I should not find you such as I could wish, and I should be found to you such as ye would not: least there should be contentions, emulations, animosities, strifes, thwartings, whisperings, swellings, tumults: and least,
047	2CO	012	021	when I come again, my God should humble me among you, and I should be grieved for many of those who have sinned heretofore, and have not repented of the impurity, and fornication, and lewdness which they have practised.
047	2CO	013	001	This, I say, is the third time I am coming to you: and at the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established.
047	2CO	013	002	I said before, and I again tell you beforehand, as if I were present the second time; and being absent I now write to those who have sinned heretofore, and to all the rest, that if I come again I will not spare:
047	2CO	013	003	since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, who is not weak toward you, but is powerful among you.
047	2CO	013	004	For if He was crucified as from weakness, yet He now liveth by the power of God: for we also are weak in Him, but shall live with Him by the power of God manifested to you.
047	2CO	013	005	Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove yourselves: do ye not know yourselves to be such that Jesus Christ is in you? unless ye are reprovable.
047	2CO	013	006	But I hope ye will soon know that we are not disapproved.
047	2CO	013	007	I pray to God that ye may do no evil: and not that we may appear to be approved by your punishment, but that ye may do that which is good, though we should seem to be disapproved.
047	2CO	013	008	For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.
047	2CO	013	009	For we rejoice when we exert not our power, and when ye are strong: as this is what we wish, even your perfection.
047	2CO	013	010	Therefore I write these things while absent, that when present I may not use severity, according to the power which the Lord hath given me for edification, and not for destruction.
047	2CO	013	011	Finally, my brethren, farewel: be reformed, be exhorted, be of one mind, live in peace: and the God of love and peace will be with you.
047	2CO	013	012	Salute one another with an holy kiss.
047	2CO	013	013	All the saints salute you. May the favor of the Lord Jesus Christ,
047	2CO	013	014	and the love of God, and the communication of the Holy Spirit be with you all. Amen.

# BOOK	048	GAL	Galatians	Galatians
048	GAL	001	001	Paul an apostle (not from men, nor by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised Him from the dead),
048	GAL	001	002	and all the brethren that are with me, to the churches of Galatia:
048	GAL	001	003	grace be to you and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ,
048	GAL	001	004	who gave himself for our sins, that He might deliver us from the present evil world, according to the will of our God and Father:
048	GAL	001	005	to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
048	GAL	001	006	I wonder that ye are so soon removed from him who called you by the grace of Christ to another gospel: which is not another;
048	GAL	001	007	but there be some that disturb you, and would subvert the gospel of Christ.
048	GAL	001	008	But tho' we or an angel from heaven should preach to you any other gospel than what we have preached to you; let him be accursed.
048	GAL	001	009	I say it again, if any one preach to you any other gospel than what ye have received, let him be accursed.
048	GAL	001	010	For do I now persuade you to obey men or God? Or do I seek to please men? if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.
048	GAL	001	011	But I assure you, brethren, that the gospel preached by me is not of human invention.
048	GAL	001	012	For I neither received it, nor was taught it by man, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.
048	GAL	001	013	For ye have heard of my conversation formerly in Judaism, that I outragiously persecuted the church of God, and laid it waste:
048	GAL	001	014	and I made a proficiency in Judaism above many of the same age with me in my own nation, being excessively zealous for the traditions of my fathers.
048	GAL	001	015	But when it pleased God, (who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace,)
048	GAL	001	016	to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach Him among the gentiles; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood,
048	GAL	001	017	nor went I up to Jerusalem to those that were apostles before me, but I departed into Arabia, and afterwards returned again to Damascus.
048	GAL	001	018	Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Peter, and I staid with him fifteen days.
048	GAL	001	019	But I saw no other of the apostles, except James the brother of our Lord.
048	GAL	001	020	(Now in what I write to you, behold, before God, I do not lie.)
048	GAL	001	021	Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia,
048	GAL	001	022	and was not known in person to the churches of Judea, which were in Christ.
048	GAL	001	023	But only they had heard that he who persecuted us before, now preacheth the faith which he formerly would have destroyed.
048	GAL	001	024	And they glorified God on my account.
048	GAL	002	001	Fourteen years after, I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus also with me.
048	GAL	002	002	But I went up according to a divine revelation, and laid before them the gospel which I preach among the gentiles: though privately to those of note, least I should run, or had run in vain.
048	GAL	002	003	But even Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was not compelled to be circumcised;
048	GAL	002	004	and that because of the false brethren clandestinely introduced, who had crept in as spies upon our liberty, which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:
048	GAL	002	005	to whom we yielded no submission, not even for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.
048	GAL	002	006	And as to those who seemed to be men of note, whatever they were, it is all one to me, (God accepteth no man's person) for even these eminent persons added nothing more to me.
048	GAL	002	007	But on the contrary, seeing that I was intrusted with the gospel of uncircumcision, as Peter was with that of the circumcision;
048	GAL	002	008	(for He who wrought effectually in Peter as to the apostleship of the circumcision, wrought effectually also in me as to the gentiles:)
048	GAL	002	009	and knowing the grace which was given to me; James, and Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars of the church, gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go to the gentiles, and they to the circumcision.
048	GAL	002	010	Only desiring that we would remember the poor: which I also was forward to do.
048	GAL	002	011	But when Peter came to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was indeed to be blamed.
048	GAL	002	012	For before certain men came from James, he did eat with the gentiles; but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing those of the circumcision.
048	GAL	002	013	And the rest of the Jews dissembled also with him; so that Barnabas too was carried away with their dissimulation.
048	GAL	002	014	But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said to Peter before them all, ---If thou, who art a Jew, livest sometimes after the manner of the gentiles, and not like the Jews, why dost thou now in a manner compel the gentiles to judaize?
048	GAL	002	015	We, who are Jews by birth, and not sinners of the gentiles,
048	GAL	002	016	knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by faith in Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by faith in Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.
048	GAL	002	017	But if while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is Christ therefore the minister of sin?
048	GAL	002	018	God forbid. And if I build again the same things which I demolished, I shew myself a transgressor: for I through the law am dead to the law,
048	GAL	002	019	that I might live unto God.
048	GAL	002	020	I am crucified with Christ; yet I live, though no longer I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me, and gave up himself for me.
048	GAL	002	021	I do not frustate the grace of God: for if righteousness be by the law, then Christ died in vain.
048	GAL	003	001	O senseless Galatians, who hath so bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth? you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth as crucified.
048	GAL	003	002	This only would I learn of you, Did ye receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?
048	GAL	003	003	Are ye so void of understanding? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?
048	GAL	003	004	have ye suffered so many things in vain? if indeed in vain.
048	GAL	003	005	He therefore that imparteth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, doth he it by the works of the law, or by the doctrine of faith?
048	GAL	003	006	As Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness:
048	GAL	003	007	so ye know that they who believe, are the children of Abraham.
048	GAL	003	008	And the scripture foreseeing that God would justify the gentiles through faith, preached the gospel to Abraham long ago, saying, "In thee shall all nations be blessed."
048	GAL	003	009	So then they that believe, are blessed with believing Abraham.
048	GAL	003	010	For as many as are of the works of the law, are under the curse; for it is written, Cursed be every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law, to do them.
048	GAL	003	011	And that by the law no one is justified before God is evident; for it is written "The just shall live by faith:"
048	GAL	003	012	now the law is not of faith, but saith, "The man that doth them, shall live in them."
048	GAL	003	013	Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, having been made a curse for us: for it is written, "Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:"
048	GAL	003	014	that the blessing of Abraham might come on the gentiles by Christ Jesus; that we through faith might receive the promise of the Spirit.
048	GAL	003	015	Brethren, (I speak after the manner of men,) no one cancelleth or addeth to a covenant which hath been ratified, though it be but the covenant of a man.
048	GAL	003	016	Now the promises were made to Abraham, and to his seed. He doth not say, "and to seeds," as of many; but as of one, "and to thy seed," which is Christ.
048	GAL	003	017	This then I say, that the law, which was given four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul the covenant, which was so long before confirmed by God unto Christ, to make void the promise.
048	GAL	003	018	For if the inheritance be from the law, it is no more from the promise: whereas God gave it to Abraham by promise.
048	GAL	003	019	What then availeth the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come, to whom the promise was made; and it was delivered by angels in the hand of a mediator.
048	GAL	003	020	Now a mediator is not the mediator of one only; and God is but one.
048	GAL	003	021	Is the law then contrary to the promises of God? not at all: for if a law had been given, which could have confered life, certainly righteousness would have been by the law.
048	GAL	003	022	But the scripture hath shut up all under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.
048	GAL	003	023	But before faith came, we were kept shut up under the law, till the faith appeared which was to be revealed.
048	GAL	003	024	So that the law was our guide to lead us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.
048	GAL	003	025	But now faith is come we are no longer under a pedagogue.
048	GAL	003	026	For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.
048	GAL	003	027	For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ, have put on Christ:
048	GAL	003	028	and there is neither Jew nor Greek, those is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female; for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.
048	GAL	003	029	And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.
048	GAL	004	001	Now as long as the heir is a child, he differeth nothing from a servant, though he is to be lord of all:
048	GAL	004	002	but is under guardians and managers till the time appointed by the father.
048	GAL	004	003	So we when we were children, were in servitude under the elements of the world:
048	GAL	004	004	but when the fulness of the time came, God sent forth his Son born of a woman made under the law,
048	GAL	004	005	that He might redeem those that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.
048	GAL	004	006	And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.
048	GAL	004	007	So that thou art no longer a servant, but a son; and if a son, an heir also of God through Christ.
048	GAL	004	008	But then indeed, when ye knew not God, ye served those which in reality are no gods.
048	GAL	004	009	But now that ye know God, or rather are known by God, how is it that ye turn again to the poor weak elements, to which ye desire again to be in bondage as before?
048	GAL	004	010	Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years:
048	GAL	004	011	so that I am afraid for you, least I have indeed bestowed upon you labour in vain.
048	GAL	004	012	Brethren, I beseech you, be as I am; for I also was as ye are: and ye have not injured me at all.
048	GAL	004	013	But ye know that in the infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel to you at first:
048	GAL	004	014	and my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected me for it; but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.
048	GAL	004	015	What then was your blessedness? for I bear you witness that, if it had been possible, ye would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me.
048	GAL	004	016	And am I become your enemy for telling you the truth?
048	GAL	004	017	They are zealous for you, but not as they ought: for they would exclude us, that ye may be zealous for them:
048	GAL	004	018	But it is good to be zealously affected always in that which is good, and not only when I am present with you.
048	GAL	004	019	My little children, of whom I do as it were travail in birth again,
048	GAL	004	020	till Christ be formed in you, I should be glad to be present with you even now, and to change my voice; for I am in doubt about you.
048	GAL	004	021	Tell me, you that are so desirous to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?
048	GAL	004	022	where it is written, that Abraham had two sons, one by a servant, and one by a free-woman?
048	GAL	004	023	But he who was of the servant, was born according to the course of nature; whereas the son of the free-woman was by virtue of the promise.
048	GAL	004	024	Which things are figurative; for these persons are emblems of the two covenants, the one from mount Sinai, bringing forth children unto bondage, which is Hagar: for this name Hagar,
048	GAL	004	025	a rock, is expressive of mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to the present Jerusalem, which is in bondage with her children.
048	GAL	004	026	But the Jerusalem above is represented by the free-woman, which is the mother of us all.
048	GAL	004	027	For it is written, Rejoice thou barren, that for a while didst not bear, break forth and cry aloud for joy, thou that didst not travail with child; for many more are the children of the desolate than of her that hath an husband."
048	GAL	004	028	Now we, brethren, like Isaac, are children of the promise.
048	GAL	004	029	But as then he that was born after the flesh, persecuted him who was born after the Spirit, even so it is now.
048	GAL	004	030	But what saith the scripture? "Cast out the servant and her son: for the son of the servant shall not inherit with the son of the free-woman."
048	GAL	004	031	Now we, my brethren, are not children of the servant, but of the free-woman.
048	GAL	005	001	Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again in the yoke of bondage.
048	GAL	005	002	Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ will profit you nothing.
048	GAL	005	003	And I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to the whole law.
048	GAL	005	004	Christ is become nothing to you, whosoever of you are seeking to be justified by the law: ye are fallen from the grace of the gospel.
048	GAL	005	005	For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.
048	GAL	005	006	For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but faith which worketh by love.
048	GAL	005	007	Ye did run well: who hindered you from obeying the truth?
048	GAL	005	008	This persuasion came not from him that called you: but a little leaven leaveneth the whole mass.
048	GAL	005	009	I have confidence in you however through the Lord,
048	GAL	005	010	that ye will not think otherwise: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgement, whosoever he be.
048	GAL	005	011	And I, brethren, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted by the Jews? for then the offence of the cross is ceased.
048	GAL	005	012	I wish they were even cut off from your communion, that make such disturbance amongst you.
048	GAL	005	013	For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only abuse not this liberty for an occasion to indulge the flesh, but by mutual love serve one another.
048	GAL	005	014	For all the law is fulfilled in one precept, even in this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
048	GAL	005	015	But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not destroyed by one another.
048	GAL	005	016	I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye will not fulfil the desire of the flesh:
048	GAL	005	017	for the flesh desireth things contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit things contrary to the flesh: and these are opposite to each other; so that ye do not those things which ye would.
048	GAL	005	018	But if ye be led by the Spirit, ye are not under the law.
048	GAL	005	019	Now the works of the flesh are manifest, such as, adultery, fornication, uncleanness,
048	GAL	005	020	lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, enmities, strifes, emulations, animosities, contentions, divisions,
048	GAL	005	021	heresies, envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and the like: of which I forewarn you, as I have also told you before, that they who practise such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.
048	GAL	005	022	But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering,
048	GAL	005	023	gentleness, goodness, fidelity, meekness, temperance: against such things there is no law.
048	GAL	005	024	And they, that are Christ's, have crucified the flesh with it's passions and desires.
048	GAL	005	025	If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.
048	GAL	005	026	Let us not be vain-glorious, provoking one another, envying one another.
048	GAL	006	001	Brethren, if a man be overtaken in any fault, do ye, who are spiritual, restore such a one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, least thou also shouldst be tempted.
048	GAL	006	002	Bear one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.
048	GAL	006	003	For if any one thinketh that he is something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.
048	GAL	006	004	But let every one try his own work, and then he will have matter of glorying in himself alone, and not in another.
048	GAL	006	005	For every one shall bear his own burthen.
048	GAL	006	006	And let him, that is instructed in the word, communicate in all good things to him that instructeth.
048	GAL	006	007	Be not deceived, God is not to be mocked: for whatever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.
048	GAL	006	008	He then, who soweth to his flesh, shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he, that soweth to the Spirit, shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.
048	GAL	006	009	And let us not be weary in doing good: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.
048	GAL	006	010	And therefore as we have opportunity, let us do good to all men, but especially to those who are of the houshold of faith.
048	GAL	006	011	Ye see in how large letters I have written to you with my own hand.
048	GAL	006	012	They, who want to make a fair appearance in the flesh, would constrain you to be circumcised; only that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ.
048	GAL	006	013	For they, who are circumcised, do not themselves keep the law: but they would have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.
048	GAL	006	014	But God forbid that I should glory, unless in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified to me, and I to the world.
048	GAL	006	015	For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but being created anew.
048	GAL	006	016	And as many as shall walk according to this rule, peace and mercy be on them, even upon all the Israel of God.
048	GAL	006	017	For the future, let no one give me uneasiness: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.
048	GAL	006	018	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, my brethren. Amen.

# BOOK	049	EPH	Ephesians	Ephesians
049	EPH	001	001	Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ, by the will of God, to the saints, who are at Ephesus, even the faithful in Christ Jesus;
049	EPH	001	002	grace be to you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
049	EPH	001	003	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly things by Christ;
049	EPH	001	004	according as he hath chosen us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and unblameable before Him in love:
049	EPH	001	005	having before appointed us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ unto Himself, according to the good pleasure of his will;
049	EPH	001	006	to the praise of his glorious grace, whereby He hath made us acceptable in the Beloved:
049	EPH	001	007	in whom we have redemption through his blood, even the remission of sins, according to the riches of his grace;
049	EPH	001	008	wherein He hath abounded towards us with the highest wisdom and prudence;
049	EPH	001	009	having made known to us the secret of his will, according to his good pleasure, which He had before purposed in Himself:
049	EPH	001	010	that in the dispensation of the fulness of times, He might reduce all things, both in heaven and on earth, under one head in Christ:
049	EPH	001	011	even in Him, in whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated to it according to the purpose of Him who effecteth all things after the counsel of His own will:
049	EPH	001	012	that we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ.
049	EPH	001	013	In whom ye also trusted, when ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also when ye believed, ye were sealed with the holy Spirit of promise,
049	EPH	001	014	who is the pledge of our inheritance, till the redemption of his purchased possession, to the praise of his glory.
049	EPH	001	015	Wherefore I also, having heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus,
049	EPH	001	016	and your love to all the saints, cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers;
049	EPH	001	017	that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, would give you the Spirit of wisdom and revelation to the knowledge of Him,
049	EPH	001	018	and enlighten the eyes of your understanding; that ye may know, what is the hope of his calling, and how rich the glory of his inheritance in the saints;
049	EPH	001	019	and what the exceeding greatness of his power towards us who believe, according to the energy of his mighty strength;
049	EPH	001	020	which He exerted in Christ, when He raised Him from the dead, and set Him at his own right hand in heavenly places,
049	EPH	001	021	far above all principality and power and might and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:
049	EPH	001	022	and hath put all things under his feet, and given Him to be head over all things to the church;
049	EPH	001	023	which is his body, the complete work of Him, who filleth all in all.
049	EPH	002	001	And you hath he made alive who were dead in trespasses and sins,
049	EPH	002	002	in which ye formerly walked after the manner of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that still operates in the children of disobedience:
049	EPH	002	003	among whom also we were all conversant heretofore in our carnal desires, indulging the appetites of the flesh and of our imaginations; and were by nature children of wrath, even as others.
049	EPH	002	004	But God being rich in mercy, through his great love wherewith He loved us,
049	EPH	002	005	hath made us alive in Christ, even when we were dead in trespasses, (for by grace ye are saved) and hath raised us up together,
049	EPH	002	006	and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.
049	EPH	002	007	That in the ages to come He might shew the superabundant riches of his grace, in his kindness towards us through Christ Jesus.
049	EPH	002	008	For by grace ye are saved, through faith: and this not of yourselves; it is the gift of God: not by works, that no one may boast:
049	EPH	002	009	for we are his workmanship,
049	EPH	002	010	created in Christ Jesus unto good works, for which God before prepared us, that we might walk in them.
049	EPH	002	011	Wherefore remember that ye were formerly Gentiles in the flesh, called uncircumcision by that which is called circumcision made by hands in the flesh;
049	EPH	002	012	and ye were at that time without Christ, aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world: but now in Christ Jesus,
049	EPH	002	013	ye, who were formerly afar off, are made nigh by the blood of Christ.
049	EPH	002	014	For He is our peace, who hath made both one, and removed the wall of partition from between us;
049	EPH	002	015	having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances, that He might form the two into one new man, in Himself, so making peace;
049	EPH	002	016	and that He might reconcile both in one body unto God, by the cross, having thereby slain the enmity:
049	EPH	002	017	and He came and preached peace to you that were afar off, and to them that were nigh.
049	EPH	002	018	For through Him we both have access by one Spirit to the Father.
049	EPH	002	019	Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the houshold of God;
049	EPH	002	020	being built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner-stone:
049	EPH	002	021	in whom the whole building fitly joined together increaseth to an holy temple in the Lord:
049	EPH	002	022	in whom ye also are built up together for an habitation of God by the Spirit.
049	EPH	003	001	For this cause I Paul am the prisoner of Jesus Christ for the sake of you Gentiles:
049	EPH	003	002	as ye have heard the dispensation of the grace of God, which was given me to preach unto you:
049	EPH	003	003	that by immediate revelation He made known to me the mystery, (as I wrote before in brief, by which,
049	EPH	003	004	when ye read it, ye may perceive my knowledge in the mystery of Christ,)
049	EPH	003	005	which in other generations was not made known to men, as it is now revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit; that the Gentiles should be co-heirs,
049	EPH	003	006	and of the same body, and joint-partakers of his promise in Christ, by the gospel:
049	EPH	003	007	of which I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God conferred on me by the effectual operation of his power.
049	EPH	003	008	On me, who am less than the least of all saints, was this grace bestowed, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ,
049	EPH	003	009	and make all men to see the communication of the mystery, which from the ages past hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ;
049	EPH	003	010	that the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known by the church to the principalities and powers in the heavenly regions;
049	EPH	003	011	according to the ancient purpose, which He executed in Christ Jesus our Lord:
049	EPH	003	012	by whom we have freedom and access with confidence through faith in Him.
049	EPH	003	013	Wherefore I desire that ye would not be discouraged at my afflictions on your account, which is your glory.
049	EPH	003	014	For this cause I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
049	EPH	003	015	from whom the whole family in heaven and on earth is named,
049	EPH	003	016	that He would grant you, according to his glorious riches, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit, as to the inner man;
049	EPH	003	017	that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith: and be ye rooted and grounded in love,
049	EPH	003	018	that ye may be able, with all the saints, to comprehend what is the breadth, and length, and depth,
049	EPH	003	019	and height, and to know the love of Christ, which surpasseth knowledge; that ye may be filled according to the abundant fulness of God.
049	EPH	003	020	Now to Him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we can ask or think, according to the power operating in us,
049	EPH	003	021	to Him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus, throughout all the generations of eternal ages. Amen.
049	EPH	004	001	I therefore, a prisoner for the sake of the Lord, exhort you to walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called, with all humility and meekness;
049	EPH	004	002	and with long-suffering forbear one another in love,
049	EPH	004	003	endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace: for there is but one body and one Spirit,
049	EPH	004	004	even as ye are called in one hope of your calling;
049	EPH	004	005	one Lord, one faith, one baptism,
049	EPH	004	006	one God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in all.
049	EPH	004	007	But grace is given to each of us, according to the measure of the gift of Christ.
049	EPH	004	008	Wherefore it is said, "When he ascended on high, He led captivity captive, and gave gifts to men."
049	EPH	004	009	Now this expression "He ascended" what does it mean, but that He descended first into the lower parts of the earth?
049	EPH	004	010	He that descended is the same also that ascended far above all heavens, that he might fill all things.
049	EPH	004	011	And therefore He gave some to be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some pastors and teachers; to qualify holy men for the work of the ministry,
049	EPH	004	012	to the edifying of the body of Christ:
049	EPH	004	013	till we all arrive in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, at perfect maturity, even to the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ.
049	EPH	004	014	That we may be no longer children fluctuating and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the artful insinuations of men, and their crafty methods of deceiving;
049	EPH	004	015	but holding the truth in love, may grow up in all things into Him, who is the head, even Christ:
049	EPH	004	016	from whom the whole body being fitly joined together and compacted by the aid of every joint, according to the operation proportioned to every part, maketh an increase to the edification of itself in love.
049	EPH	004	017	This I say therefore, and charge you in the name of the Lord, that ye no longer walk as the rest of the Gentiles walk,
049	EPH	004	018	in the vanity of their mind, darkened in their understanding, and alienated from the life of God, through the ignorance that is in them, by reason of the hardness of their heart:
049	EPH	004	019	who, being past feeling, have given themselves up to lasciviousness, to commit all uncleanness with greediness.
049	EPH	004	020	But ye have not so learned Christ;
049	EPH	004	021	if ye have indeed hearkened to Him, and been instructed in Him, as the truth is in Jesus; to put off the old man,
049	EPH	004	022	which according to your former conversation was corrupted with deceitful lusts,
049	EPH	004	023	and be renewed in the spirit of your mind;
049	EPH	004	024	and to put on the new man, which according to the image of God is created in righteousness, and true holiness.
049	EPH	004	025	Wherefore putting away lying, speak ye every one truth to his neighbor; for we are all members of one society.
049	EPH	004	026	Be angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath;
049	EPH	004	027	and give not the devil room to ensnare you.
049	EPH	004	028	Let him that stole steal no more; but rather let him labour, doing some good with his hands, that he may have something to bestow on him that hath need of it.
049	EPH	004	029	Let no corrupt word come out of your mouth; but what is good to useful edification, that it may benefit the hearers.
049	EPH	004	030	And grieve not the holy Spirit of God whereby ye are sealed to the day of redemption.
049	EPH	004	031	Let all bitterness, and wrath, and fury, and clamor, and calumny, be put away from you, with all malice: and be kind one to another,
049	EPH	004	032	tender-hearted, forgiving one another, even as God in Christ forgiveth you.
049	EPH	005	001	Be ye therefore imitators of God as his dear children; and walk in love,
049	EPH	005	002	even as Christ hath loved us, and given Himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for an odor of sweet perfume.
049	EPH	005	003	But fornication, and all uncleanness, or inordinate desire, let it not be even named among you; for so it becometh saints:
049	EPH	005	004	nor ribaldry, nor buffoonery, nor wanton jesting, which are not meet: but rather giving of thanks.
049	EPH	005	005	For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, (who is an idolater,) hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.
049	EPH	005	006	Let no one deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.
049	EPH	005	007	Therefore be not partners with them.
049	EPH	005	008	For ye were heretofore darkness, but now ye are light in the Lord:
049	EPH	005	009	walk therefore as children of light, (for the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth,)
049	EPH	005	010	approving what is well-pleasing to the Lord.
049	EPH	005	011	And have no communion with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.
049	EPH	005	012	For it is a shame even to relate the things that are done by them in secret.
049	EPH	005	013	But all things to be reproved: are made manifest by the light: for whatever doth make manifest, is light.
049	EPH	005	014	Wherefore He saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.
049	EPH	005	015	See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise men:
049	EPH	005	016	redeeming the time, because the days are evil.
049	EPH	005	017	Wherefore be not thoughtless, but consider what is the will of the Lord.
049	EPH	005	018	And be not drunk with wine, in which there is riotous excess; but be filled with the Spirit:
049	EPH	005	019	speaking to yourselves in psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord:
049	EPH	005	020	always giving thanks for all to God even the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ:
049	EPH	005	021	submitting yourselves to each other in the fear of God.
049	EPH	005	022	Wives, be subject to your own husbands, as to the Lord:
049	EPH	005	023	for the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and the saviour of that body.
049	EPH	005	024	As the church then is subject to Christ, so also should wives be to their own husbands in every thing.
049	EPH	005	025	Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave up Himself for it:
049	EPH	005	026	to sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,
049	EPH	005	027	that He might prepare it for Himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing: but that it should be holy and unblameable.
049	EPH	005	028	Men ought so to love their wives, as their own bodies: he that loveth his wife, loveth himself.
049	EPH	005	029	For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord also doth the church:
049	EPH	005	030	for we are members of his body, as if taken out of his flesh, and of his bones, as Eve was out of Adam's.
049	EPH	005	031	For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined to his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.
049	EPH	005	032	This mystery is great: but I speak concerning Christ and the Church.
049	EPH	005	033	Nevertheless, let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and let the wife reverence her husband.
049	EPH	006	001	Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.
049	EPH	006	002	Honour thy father and thy mother, (which is the first commandment with promise,)
049	EPH	006	003	that it may be well with thee, and thou shalt be long-lived upon the earth.
049	EPH	006	004	And ye fathers, do not exasperate your children: but educate them in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.
049	EPH	006	005	Servants, obey them that are your masters according to the flesh, with reverential fear, in the simplicity of your heart, as unto Christ:
049	EPH	006	006	not with eye-service as men-pleasers, but as servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;
049	EPH	006	007	with good-will, as serving the Lord rather than men:
049	EPH	006	008	knowing that whatever good any one doth, he shall receive the reward of it from the Lord, whether He be a slave or free.
049	EPH	006	009	And ye masters, do the same to them, forbearing threatening: knowing that ye yourselves also have a Master in heaven, and there is no respect of persons with Him.
049	EPH	006	010	Moreover, my brethren, strengthen yourselves in the Lord, and in his mighty power.
049	EPH	006	011	Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the Devil.
049	EPH	006	012	For our conflict is not with flesh and blood only, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the world and of the darkness of this age, against wicked spirits in heavenly places.
049	EPH	006	013	Take therefore the complete armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all to stand.
049	EPH	006	014	Stand therefore having your loins girt about with truth, and putting on the breast-plate of righteousness:
049	EPH	006	015	and having your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace:
049	EPH	006	016	over all taking the shield of faith, whereby ye will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one:
049	EPH	006	017	take also the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:
049	EPH	006	018	praying at all seasons with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance, and intercession for all the saints;
049	EPH	006	019	and for me particularly, that utterance may be given me, that I may open my mouth with freedom, to make known the mystery of the gospel:
049	EPH	006	020	for which I am an ambassador though in chains: that I may speak boldly in behalf of it, as I ought to speak.
049	EPH	006	021	But that ye also may know my affairs, and what I am doing here, Tychicus a beloved brother, and a faithful minister in the Lord, shall make all known to you: whom I have sent to you,
049	EPH	006	022	for this very end, that ye might know our concerns, and that he may comfort your hearts.
049	EPH	006	023	Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
049	EPH	006	024	Grace be with all that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. Amen.

# BOOK	050	PHI	Philippians	Philippians
050	PHI	001	001	Paul and Timothy, servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus, which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:
050	PHI	001	002	grace be unto you, and peace from God our father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
050	PHI	001	003	I give thanks unto my God upon every mention of you,
050	PHI	001	004	(always making supplication for you all with joy
050	PHI	001	005	in every prayer of mine) for your attachment to the gospel, from the first day even till now;
050	PHI	001	006	being confident of this, that He who hath begun a good work in you will continue to perfect it till the day of Jesus Christ.
050	PHI	001	007	As it is just for me to think this of you all, because ye have me in your heart, both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, being all of you partakers of the same grace with me.
050	PHI	001	008	For God is my witness, how much I long for you all, as with the bowels of Jesus Christ.
050	PHI	001	009	And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all discernment;
050	PHI	001	010	that ye may try things that differ, that ye may be sincere and without offence until the day of Christ;
050	PHI	001	011	being full of the fruits of righteousness which are through Jesus Christ unto the glory and praise of God.
050	PHI	001	012	But I would have you know, my brethren, that the things, which have befallen me, have proved rather to the advancement of the gospel:
050	PHI	001	013	so that my bonds are manifest in all the palace, and all other places, to be for the sake of Christ;
050	PHI	001	014	and many of the brethren in the Lord, encouraged by my bonds, are much more bold to publish the word without fear.
050	PHI	001	015	Some indeed through envy and strife, and some also through good-will:
050	PHI	001	016	the former preach Christ out of contention, not sincerely, thinking to add affliction to my bonds;
050	PHI	001	017	the others out of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel.
050	PHI	001	018	What then? yet every way, whether in pretence or in truth, Christ is preached: and in this I rejoice, yea and I will rejoice;
050	PHI	001	019	for I know that this shall turn to my safety through your prayer, and the aid of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.
050	PHI	001	020	According to my earnest expectation and hope, that I shall be put to shame in nothing; but that with all freedom of speech, as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether by life or by death.
050	PHI	001	021	For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain: and if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labor:
050	PHI	001	022	so that I know not what to chuse;
050	PHI	001	023	for I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ, which is much preferable:
050	PHI	001	024	but to abide in the flesh is more necessary for you.
050	PHI	001	025	And as I am confident of this, I know that I shall abide and shall continue with you all, for your improvement and the joy of your faith:
050	PHI	001	026	that your rejoicing in Christ Jesus may abound through me, by my coming to you again.
050	PHI	001	027	Only behave worthy of the gospel of Christ, that whether I come and see you, or be absent, I may hear of you, that ye stand firm in one Spirit, striving together as with one soul for the saith of the gospel;
050	PHI	001	028	and are in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is a demonstration of ruin to them, but to you of salvation, and this from God.
050	PHI	001	029	For to you it is granted as a favor from Christ, not only to believe on Him, but also to suffer for his sake:
050	PHI	001	030	having the same conflict as ye saw in me, and now hear to be in me.
050	PHI	002	001	If therefore there be any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any participation of the Spirit,
050	PHI	002	002	if any bowels of compassion, compleat ye my joy, be like-minded, maintaining the same love, with your souls united, in attending to the one thing needful.
050	PHI	002	003	Do nothing through strife or vain-glory, but in lowliness of mind each esteeming others better than themselves.
050	PHI	002	004	Look not every one to his own interests only, but every one also to the concerns of others.
050	PHI	002	005	Let the same mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:
050	PHI	002	006	who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be as God.
050	PHI	002	007	Yet He emptied himself, assuming the form of a servant, when made in the likeness of men:
050	PHI	002	008	and being in the human state, He humbled himself, and was obedient even unto death, and that the death of the cross.
050	PHI	002	009	Wherefore God hath highly exalted Him, and given Him a name above every name:
050	PHI	002	010	that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of celestial beings, as well as of those on earth, and of those under the earth;
050	PHI	002	011	and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
050	PHI	002	012	Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed the gospel, not only in my presence, but now much more in my absence; be still working out your own salvation though with fear and trembling:
050	PHI	002	013	for it is God that worketh in you both to will, and to work, out of his own good-pleasure.
050	PHI	002	014	Do all things without murmurings and disputings:
050	PHI	002	015	that ye may be blameless and inoffensive, the children of God without reproof, in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation; among whom ye shine as lights in the world,
050	PHI	002	016	exhibiting the word of life; to my rejoicing in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, nor laboured in vain.
050	PHI	002	017	But if I be even poured forth as a libation on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice and congratulate with you all.
050	PHI	002	018	And for the same cause do ye also rejoice, and congratulate with me.
050	PHI	002	019	But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you shortly, that I also may be refreshed, by knowing the state of your affairs.
050	PHI	002	020	For I have no one of a like spirit, who will with a kind of natural affection take care of your affairs.
050	PHI	002	021	For all seek their own interests, not those of Christ Jesus.
050	PHI	002	022	But ye know the proof I have had of him, that as son with a father he served with me in the gospel.
050	PHI	002	023	I hope therefore to send him as soon as I see the issue of my own affairs.
050	PHI	002	024	But I trust in the Lord, that I shall soon come myself too.
050	PHI	002	025	However, I thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus my brother, and fellow-laborer, and fellow-soldier, but your messenger, who ministred to my wants:
050	PHI	002	026	for he much longed after you all, and was greatly concerned because ye had heard that he was sick.
050	PHI	002	027	For indeed he was sick and nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him, and not on him only, but on me also, that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow.
050	PHI	002	028	I have sent him therefore the more desirously, that when ye see him again ye may rejoice, and I may be the less sorrowful.
050	PHI	002	029	Receive him therefore in the Lord with all joy, and have such in high esteem:
050	PHI	002	030	because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding his own life, so that he might fill up what was wanting in your kind offices towards me.
050	PHI	003	001	Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you is not irksome to me, and for you it is safe.
050	PHI	003	002	Beware of those that are like dogs, beware of evil doers, beware of the concision.
050	PHI	003	003	For we are of the true circumcision, who worship God in spirit, rejoicing in Christ Jesus, and having no confidence in the flesh.
050	PHI	003	004	Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other thinks he hath whereof to trust in the flesh, I more:
050	PHI	003	005	having been circumcised on the eighth day, of the race of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of Hebrews, with respect to the law a pharisee,
050	PHI	003	006	as to zeal persecuting the church, as to the righteousness of the law blameless: but those things,
050	PHI	003	007	which were once gain to me, I counted loss for Christ.
050	PHI	003	008	Yea doubtless and I count all but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all, and I account them but dung, that I may gain Christ, and be found in Him,
050	PHI	003	009	not having my own righteousness which is of the law, but that which is by the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith: that I may know Him,
050	PHI	003	010	and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable to his death;
050	PHI	003	011	if by any means I may attain to the resurrection of the dead:
050	PHI	003	012	not that I have yet won the prize, or am already perfect: but I press forward to acquire that perfection, for which also I have been apprehended by Christ Jesus.
050	PHI	003	013	Brethren, I count not myself to have attained it: but one thing I do, forgetting the things which are behind, and stretching forward to those before,
050	PHI	003	014	I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.
050	PHI	003	015	Let us therefore, as many as are perfect, attend to this: and if in any thing ye think differently, God will reveal this also unto you.
050	PHI	003	016	But in what we have attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing.
050	PHI	003	017	Brethren, be imitators of me, and observe those that walk as ye have us for an example.
050	PHI	003	018	(For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ: whose end is destruction,
050	PHI	003	019	whose God is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame; who mind earthly things) For our conversation is in heaven,
050	PHI	003	020	from whence also we expect the Saviour, our Lord Jesus Christ: who will change our vile body,
050	PHI	003	021	that it may be made like his glorious body, according to the energy of his ability to subdue all things to Himself.
050	PHI	004	001	Wherefore, my brethren, beloved and much desired, my joy and crown, so stand ye fast in the Lord, my beloved.
050	PHI	004	002	I exhort Euodia, and Syntyche to be perfectly united in the Lord.
050	PHI	004	003	And I entreat thee likewise, my faithful collegue, to assist them, for they laboured with me in the gospel, and Clement also, and my other fellow-laborers, whose names are in the book of life.
050	PHI	004	004	Rejoice in the Lord always, and again I say, Rejoice.
050	PHI	004	005	Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand.
050	PHI	004	006	Be anxious in nothing: but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known before God.
050	PHI	004	007	And the peace of God, which surpasseth all understanding, shall guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.
050	PHI	004	008	Finally my brethren, whatever things are true, whatever things are venerable, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are friendly, whatever things are reputable, if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think of these things:
050	PHI	004	009	and what ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, these practise; and the God of peace will be with you.
050	PHI	004	010	I rejoiced greatly in the Lord, that your care for me has now flourished again; for whom ye were indeed careful before, but ye wanted opportunity.
050	PHI	004	011	Not that I speak on account of want; for I have learnt in whatever circumstances I am, to be contented.
050	PHI	004	012	I know both how to be abased, and how to abound: in every place, and in all conditions I am instructed, both to be full and to be hungry, to abound and to be in want.
050	PHI	004	013	I can do all things through Christ strengthening me.
050	PHI	004	014	Nevertheless ye did well in communicating to the relief of my affliction.
050	PHI	004	015	And ye Philippians know, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I was departing from Macedonia, no church communicated to me on the score of giving and receiving, but you only.
050	PHI	004	016	For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again to supply my wants.
050	PHI	004	017	Not that I desire a gift, but I desire fruit that may abound to your account.
050	PHI	004	018	And indeed I have it all, and now abound: I am fully supplied, having received of Epaphroditus the things sent by you, a fragrant odor, an acceptable sacrifice, well-pleasing to God.
050	PHI	004	019	And my God will supply all your wants, according to his riches, in glory, by Christ Jesus.
050	PHI	004	020	Now to our God and Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
050	PHI	004	021	Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren that are with me salute you:
050	PHI	004	022	and all the saints here salute you, but especially those of Cesar's household.
050	PHI	004	023	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.

051	COL	001	001	Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ, by the will of God,
051	COL	001	002	and Timothy our brother, to the holy and faithful brethren in Christ at Colosse: grace be to you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
051	COL	001	003	We give thanks to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, always in our prayers for you:
051	COL	001	004	(having heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and your love to all the saints:)
051	COL	001	005	for the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, of which ye have heard before in the word of truth, that is the gospel;
051	COL	001	006	which is come unto you, even as in all the world, and is fruitful; as it hath been also among you, from the day in which ye heard and knew the grace of God in truth.
051	COL	001	007	As ye also learned of Epaphras our beloved fellow-servant, who is a faithful minister of Christ for you;
051	COL	001	008	who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit.
051	COL	001	009	For this cause we also, from the day that we heard it, cease not to pray for you, and to request that ye may be filled with the knowledge of his will, in all wisdom and spiritual understanding:
051	COL	001	010	that ye may walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;
051	COL	001	011	strengthened with all might according to his glorious power, unto all patience and long-suffering with joy;
051	COL	001	012	giving thanks unto the Father, who hath made us meet for a portion of the inheritance of the saints in light:
051	COL	001	013	who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath transferred us into the kingdom of his beloved Son:
051	COL	001	014	in whom we have redemption by his blood, even the remission of sins.
051	COL	001	015	Who is the image of the invisible God, the first-born of the whole creation:
051	COL	001	016	for by Him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are on the earth, the visible and the invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers; all were created by Him, and for Him.
051	COL	001	017	He is before all, and by Him all things subsist.
051	COL	001	018	And He is the head of the body, which is the church: who is the beginning, the first-born from the dead, that in all things He might have the pre-eminence.
051	COL	001	019	For it pleased the Father, that all fulness should dwell in Him;
051	COL	001	020	and by Him to reconcile all things to Himself, having made peace by the blood of his cross; by Him only, whether they be things on earth, or things in heaven.
051	COL	001	021	And you that were formerly alienated, and enemies in your mind by wicked works,
051	COL	001	022	yet now hath He reconciled in the body of his flesh, through death, to present you holy, and unblameable, and unreproveable in his sight:
051	COL	001	023	if so be ye continue grounded and settled in the faith, and be not moved from the gospel, which ye have heard, and which hath been preached throughout the whole creation, of which I Paul am a minister.
051	COL	001	024	Now I rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up what is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh, for the sake of his body, which is the church.
051	COL	001	025	Of which I was made a minister according to the dispensation of God, which is given me towards you, that I might fully declare the word of God:
051	COL	001	026	even that mystery which was hid from former ages and generations, but is now manifested to his saints:
051	COL	001	027	to whom God would make known the rich glory of this mystery, among the gentiles; which is this, that Christ is in you the hope of glory:
051	COL	001	028	whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus:
051	COL	001	029	in order to which I also labour, striving earnestly according to his energy which operates in me with power.
051	COL	002	001	For I would have you know what a great conflict I have for you, and for those in Laodicea, and as many as have not seen me in person:
051	COL	002	002	that their hearts may be comforted, being knit together in love, and to all the riches of a full assurance of understanding in these things, to the acknowledgment of the mystery of our God and Father, and of Christ:
051	COL	002	003	in whom are all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
051	COL	002	004	And this I say, least any one should deceive you with fine speeches.
051	COL	002	005	For though I be absent in body, yet am I with you in spirit, rejoicing and beholding your regularity, and the stedfastness of your faith in Christ.
051	COL	002	006	Therefore as ye have received Christ Jesus the Lord, walk in Him;
051	COL	002	007	rooted and built up in Him, and established in the faith, as ye have been taught it, abounding therein with thanksgiving.
051	COL	002	008	Take heed least any one make a prey of you by philosophy and vain deceit, according to the tradition of men, after the elements of the world, and not after Christ:
051	COL	002	009	for all the fulness of the deity dwelleth personally in Him.
051	COL	002	010	And ye are complete in Him, who is the head of all principality and power.
051	COL	002	011	In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision not performed by hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh, by the circumcision which is of Christ:
051	COL	002	012	being buried with Him in baptism, wherein also ye are raised together with Him, through faith in the power of God, who raised Him from the dead.
051	COL	002	013	And when ye were dead in trespasses, and in the uncircumcision of your flesh, He made you alive together with Him, having forgiven you all trespasses,
051	COL	002	014	and cancelled the obligation we were under by ritual decrees, which was grievous to us, and hath taken it quite away, even nailing it to his cross.
051	COL	002	015	And having spoiled principalities and powers, He made them an open spectacle, triumphing over them by it.
051	COL	002	016	Let no one therefore judge you on account of meat, or drink, or in respect of a feast, or a new-moon, or sabbaths;
051	COL	002	017	which are a shadow of good things to come, but the body is of Christ.
051	COL	002	018	Let no one deprive you of your reward by an affected humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into what he hath not seen, vainly puffed up by his carnal mind;
051	COL	002	019	and not adhering to the head, from which all the body, being supplied and held together as by joints and bands, increaseth with the increase of God.
051	COL	002	020	If therefore ye be dead with Christ from the elements of the world; why, as if living in the world, are ye subject to ceremonial ordinances,
051	COL	002	021	(such as "touch not, taste not,
051	COL	002	022	handle not," which all tend to corruption in the using,) according to the commandments and doctrines of men?
051	COL	002	023	which things indeed have a pretence to wisdom in voluntary worship, and humiliation, and bodily penance, as having no regard to the satisfying of the flesh.
051	COL	003	001	If ye then be risen with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ sitteth at the right hand of God.
051	COL	003	002	Mind the things above, not those on the earth.
051	COL	003	003	For ye are dead as to the world, and your life is hid with Christ in God.
051	COL	003	004	When Christ, who is your life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with Him in glory.
051	COL	003	005	Mortify therefore your members that are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, disorderly passion, evil concupiscence, and insatiable desire, which is indeed idolatry:
051	COL	003	006	for which things the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience.
051	COL	003	007	In which ye also formerly walked, when ye lived among them.
051	COL	003	008	But now put away all these also, wrath, animosity, malice, calumny, and filthy discourse out of your mouth.
051	COL	003	009	Lie not one to another, seeing ye have put off the old man with his evil practices;
051	COL	003	010	and have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge, after the image of Him that created him.
051	COL	003	011	Wherein there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, or free: but Christ is all and in all.
051	COL	003	012	Put on therefore, as the elect of God holy and beloved, bowels of mercy, benignity, humbleness of mind, meekness, long-suffering;
051	COL	003	013	bearing with one another, and forgiving one another, if any one has a complaint against any: even as Christ hath forgiven you, so also do ye.
051	COL	003	014	And above all these put on love, which is the band of perfection.
051	COL	003	015	And let the peace of God preside in your hearts, to which ye are also called as united in one body: and be thankful for it.
051	COL	003	016	Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another by psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs, with gratitude singing in your hearts to the Lord.
051	COL	003	017	And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to our God and Father by Him.
051	COL	003	018	Wives, be subject to your husbands, as becometh you in the Lord:
051	COL	003	019	and ye husbands, love your wives, and be not embittered against them.
051	COL	003	020	Children, obey your parents in all things; for this is well-pleasing to the Lord:

# BOOK	052	1TH	1 Thessalonians	1 Thessalonians
052	1TH	001	001	Paul and Silvanus and Timothy to the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father, and in the Lord Jesus Christ. Grace be to you, and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
052	1TH	001	002	We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers.
052	1TH	001	003	Incessantly remembering your work of faith, and labor of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, before our God and Father:
052	1TH	001	004	knowing, beloved brethren, your election by God.
052	1TH	001	005	For our gospel came not to you in word only, but also in power, and in the holy Ghost, and in much certainty; as ye know what sort of persons we were among you for your sakes.
052	1TH	001	006	And ye became imitators of us and of the Lord, having received the word tho' in much affliction, yet with joy of the holy Ghost.
052	1TH	001	007	So that ye became examples to all the believers in Macedonia and Achaia.
052	1TH	001	008	For the word of the Lord sounded forth from you, not only in Macedonia and Achaia; but also in every place your faith towards God is spread abroad, so that we have no need to say any thing of it.
052	1TH	001	009	For they themselves declare concerning us what kind of entrance we had among you, and how ye turned to God from idols, to serve the living and true God;
052	1TH	001	010	and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom He raised from the dead, even Jesus who delivereth us from the wrath to come.
052	1TH	002	001	For ye yourselves, brethren, know our entrance among you, that it was not in vain.
052	1TH	002	002	But though we had suffered before and been injuriously treated, as ye know, at Philippi, we spake boldly in the name of our God to declare unto you the gospel of God with much conflict.
052	1TH	002	003	For our exhortation was not of deceit, nor of impurity, nor in guile:
052	1TH	002	004	but as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, so we speak, not as pleasing men, but God, who trieth our hearts.
052	1TH	002	005	For neither at any time used we flattering speech, as ye know, nor covetous pretence, God is witness:
052	1TH	002	006	nor sought we glory of men, neither of you, nor of others: though we might have expected maintenance, as the apostles of Christ.
052	1TH	002	007	But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children:
052	1TH	002	008	so we, being affectionately desirous of you, were willing to impart to you, not only the gospel of God, but even our own souls, because ye were dear unto us.
052	1TH	002	009	For ye remember, brethren, our labor and toil; for working night and day, that we might not be burthensome to any of you, we preached among you the gospel of God.
052	1TH	002	010	Ye are witnesses, and God also, how holily, and justly, and unblameably we behaved towards you that believe:
052	1TH	002	011	as ye know likewise, how we exhorted and comforted every one of you, as a father his children;
052	1TH	002	012	and charged you, that ye should walk worthy of God, who hath called you to his kingdom and glory.
052	1TH	002	013	For this also we thank God continually, that when ye received the word of God, which ye heard from us, ye received it not as the word of men, but (as it is in truth) the word of God, which also worketh effectually in you that believe.
052	1TH	002	014	For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God, which are in Judea, in Christ Jesus, in that ye also have suffered the same things from your own countrymen, as they have from the Jews:
052	1TH	002	015	who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; who are displeasing to God, and contrary to all men:
052	1TH	002	016	forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, thus going on to fill up their sins perpetually: but wrath is coming upon them to extremity.
052	1TH	002	017	But we, brethren, being separated from you for a season, in person not in heart, endeavoured the more earnestly to see you again with much desire.
052	1TH	002	018	Wherefore we would have come unto you (even I Paul) once and again; but Satan hindered us.
052	1TH	002	019	For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of boasting? are not ye also among others in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?
052	1TH	002	020	for ye are our glory and our joy.
052	1TH	003	001	Wherefore being able to contain no longer, we were content to be left alone at Athens,
052	1TH	003	002	and sent Timothy our brother, and a minister of God, and our fellow-labourer in the gospel of Christ, to establish and exhort you concerning your faith;
052	1TH	003	003	that no one might be shaken by these afflictions: for ye yourselves know that we are appointed hereunto.
052	1TH	003	004	For when we were with you, we told you before that we should be afflicted, as it came to pass, and ye know.
052	1TH	003	005	For this cause being able to wait no longer, I sent to know the state of your faith, least the tempter should have tempted you, and our labor have been in vain.
052	1TH	003	006	But now Timothy being come back to us from you, and having brought us good tidings concerning your faith and love, and that ye have always a good remembrance of us, greatly desiring to see us, as we indeed do to see you;
052	1TH	003	007	by this we were comforted in you, my brethren, under all our affliction and distress, because of your faith:
052	1TH	003	008	for now we are revived, since you are stedfast in the Lord.
052	1TH	003	009	For what thanks can we render to God concerning you, for all the joy wherewith we rejoice on your account before our God,
052	1TH	003	010	night and day most ardently praying, that we may see your face, and perfect whatever is wanting in your faith?
052	1TH	003	011	And may God himself even our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ direct our way to you:
052	1TH	003	012	and the Lord make you to increase and abound in love to one another, and to all men, as we do towards you:
052	1TH	003	013	that your hearts may be established unblameable in holiness, before God even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, with all his saints.
052	1TH	004	001	As to what remains therefore, my brethren, we intreat and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received instructions from us, how ye ought to walk and to please God, ye would abound therein more and more.
052	1TH	004	002	For ye know what commandments we gave you from the Lord Jesus.
052	1TH	004	003	For this is the will of God, even your sanctification: that ye should abstain from fornication,
052	1TH	004	004	and that every one of you should possess his vessel in sanctification and honor,
052	1TH	004	005	not in the passion of lust, like the heathens who know not God.
052	1TH	004	006	That no one over-reach, or wrong his brother in any thing: because the Lord is an avenger of all such crimes, as we also told you before, and testified to you.
052	1TH	004	007	For God hath not called us to impurity, but to holiness.
052	1TH	004	008	He therefore who rejecteth us, rejecteth not man, but God; who hath given us his holy Spirit.
052	1TH	004	009	But as to brotherly love, ye need not that I write unto you; for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another.
052	1TH	004	010	And indeed ye do it to all the brethren, that are in all Macedonia; but we exhort you, brethren, to abound in it more and more:
052	1TH	004	011	and endeavour to be quiet, and mind your own affairs, and work with your own hands,
052	1TH	004	012	as we gave you in charge, that ye may walk decently toward those that are without, and may have need of no one's assistance.
052	1TH	004	013	But I would not have you ignorant, my brethren, concerning those that are fallen asleep, that ye may not be grieved like others who have no hope:
052	1TH	004	014	for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, so also those, that sleep in Jesus, will God bring with Him.
052	1TH	004	015	For this we tell you in the word of the Lord, that we who shall be living and remain to the coming of the Lord, shall not be before those that are asleep.
052	1TH	004	016	For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with acclamation, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpet of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first;
052	1TH	004	017	then we who are living and remain, shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we for ever be with the Lord.
052	1TH	004	018	Therefore comfort one another with these words.
052	1TH	005	001	But of the times and seasons, brethren, ye have no need of my writing to you:
052	1TH	005	002	for ye yourselves know full well, that the day of the Lord cometh like a thief in the night.
052	1TH	005	003	And when they shall say, Peace and safety, then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.
052	1TH	005	004	But ye, my brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should seize you as a thief:
052	1TH	005	005	ye are all children of the light, and of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.
052	1TH	005	006	Therefore let us not sleep like others, but let us watch and be sober:
052	1TH	005	007	for they, that sleep, sleep in the night; and drunkards are drunk in the night:
052	1TH	005	008	but let us, who are of the day, be sober; putting on the breast-plate of faith and love, and for an helmet the hope of salvation.
052	1TH	005	009	For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to the obtaining of salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,
052	1TH	005	010	who died for us, that whether we be awake, or asleep, we may live together with Him.
052	1TH	005	011	Wherefore comfort one another, and edify each other, as indeed ye do.
052	1TH	005	012	And we entreat you, brethren, to respect those that labour among you, and preside over you in the Lord, and instruct you;
052	1TH	005	013	and to esteem them very highly in love, on account of their work. Be at peace among yourselves.
052	1TH	005	014	And admonish the disorderly, comfort the feeble-minded, support the weak, be of a patient spirit towards all.
052	1TH	005	015	See that no one render evil for evil to any man; but always pursue that which is good, both to each other and to all men.
052	1TH	005	016	Be always joyful.
052	1TH	005	017	Pray continually.
052	1TH	005	018	In every circumstance be thankful; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.
052	1TH	005	019	Quench not the Spirit.
052	1TH	005	020	Slight not prophesyings:
052	1TH	005	021	yet try all things, and hold fast that which is good.
052	1TH	005	022	Abstain from all appearance of evil.
052	1TH	005	023	And may the God of peace Himself sanctify you wholly: and grant that your whole frame, spirit, soul, and body may be kept blameless to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
052	1TH	005	024	Faithful is He that calleth you, who also will do it.
052	1TH	005	025	Brethren, pray for us.
052	1TH	005	026	Salute all the brethren with an holy kiss.
052	1TH	005	027	I adjure you by the Lord, that this epistle be read to all the holy brethren.
052	1TH	005	028	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.

# BOOK	053	2TH	2 Thessalonians	2 Thessalonians
053	2TH	001	001	Paul and Silvanus and Timothy to the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father, and in the Lord Jesus Christ;
053	2TH	001	002	grace be to you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
053	2TH	001	003	We ought always to give thanks to God on your account, my brethren, as it is fit; because your faith increaseth greatly, and the love of every one of you towards each other aboundeth:
053	2TH	001	004	so that we ourselves boast of you among the churches of God, for your patience and faith under all your persecutions and afflictions which ye endure.
053	2TH	001	005	Which are a demonstration of the just judgement of God, that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer:
053	2TH	001	006	seeing it is a righteous thing with God to render affliction to those that afflict you;
053	2TH	001	007	and to you, who are in trouble, rest with us, at the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven,
053	2TH	001	008	with his mighty angels, in flaming fire, taking vengeance on those who know not God, and who obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:
053	2TH	001	009	who shall be punished with everlasting destruction, by the presence of the Lord and by his glorious power:
053	2TH	001	010	in that day, when He shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe; because our testimony among you was believed.
053	2TH	001	011	Wherefore we pray always for you, that our God would count you worthy of this calling, and fulfil all the good pleasure of his goodness, and the work of faith with power:
053	2TH	001	012	that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and ye in Him, according to the grace of our God, and of the Lord Jesus Christ.
053	2TH	002	001	But as to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and our gathering together unto Him,
053	2TH	002	002	we beseech you, brethren, that ye be not soon moved from your steadiness of mind, or troubled, neither by Spirit, nor by word, nor by letter, as from us, that the day of Christ is at hand.
053	2TH	002	003	Let not any one deceive you by any means; for it shall not come till there come an apostasy first, and the man of sin be revealed,
053	2TH	002	004	the son of perdition, who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or the object of worship; so that he sits as God in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God.
053	2TH	002	005	Do ye not remember, that when I was with you, I told you these things?
053	2TH	002	006	And ye know what now hindereth him from being revealed in his own time.
053	2TH	002	007	For the mystery of iniquity is already working, only there is one that hindreth till he be taken out of the way.
053	2TH	002	008	And then the wicked one shall be detected, whom the Lord will destroy by the breath of his mouth, and abolish by the brightness of his coming:
053	2TH	002	009	who comes, through the efficacy of Satan, with all kind of lying power, and signs,
053	2TH	002	010	and wonders, and with all iniquitous fraud, among those that shall perish; because they received not the love of the truth, by which they might be saved.
053	2TH	002	011	And for this cause God will send upon them the efficacy of error, so that they shall themselves believe the lie:
053	2TH	002	012	that they may all be condemned, who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in iniquity.
053	2TH	002	013	But we ought always to give thanks to God for you, brethren beloved of the Lord; because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation, through sanctification of the Spirit, and belief of the truth:
053	2TH	002	014	to which He hath called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
053	2TH	002	015	Therefore, brethren, be steady, and hold fast the traditions, which ye have been taught, whether by word or by our letter.
053	2TH	002	016	And may our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and our God and Father, who hath loved us, and hath given us everlasting consolation, and good hope through grace, comfort your hearts,
053	2TH	002	017	and establish you in every good word and work.
053	2TH	003	001	As for the rest, my brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may run, and be glorified, as it is among you:
053	2TH	003	002	and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men; for all have not faith.
053	2TH	003	003	But the Lord is faithful, who will establish you, and preserve you from the evil one.
053	2TH	003	004	And we trust in the Lord concerning you, that ye both do and will do the things which we give you in charge.
053	2TH	003	005	And may the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patience of Christ.
053	2TH	003	006	Now we charge you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to withdraw yourselves from every brother who walketh disorderly, and not according to the instruction which he received from us.
053	2TH	003	007	For ye know how ye ought to imitate us: for we were not disorderly among you;
053	2TH	003	008	neither did we eat any one's bread for nothing; but with labor and toil, working night and day, that we might not be burthensome to any of you.
053	2TH	003	009	Not that we have not power, but that we might give ourselves as an example to you to imitate us.
053	2TH	003	010	For when we were with you, we gave you this charge, if any will not work, neither let him eat.
053	2TH	003	011	For we hear that there are some among you that walk disorderly, doing no work themselves, but very busy in the affairs of others.
053	2TH	003	012	Such we charge and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ, that they work quietly and earn their own bread.
053	2TH	003	013	But be not you, my brethren, discouraged from well-doing. And if any obey not our order,
053	2TH	003	014	by this epistle, mark such a one, and do not keep company with him, that he may be ashamed.
053	2TH	003	015	However do not look upon him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.
053	2TH	003	016	Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times and in all places. The Lord be with you all.
053	2TH	003	017	The salutation of me Paul by my own hand, which is the token in every epistle; for so I write,
053	2TH	003	018	"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all." Amen.

# BOOK	054	1TI	1 Timothy	1 Timothy
054	1TI	001	001	Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the appointment of God our Saviour, and the Lord Jesus Christ our hope,
054	1TI	001	002	to Timothy my true son in the faith, be grace, mercy, and peace from God our Father, and Christ Jesus our Lord.
054	1TI	001	003	As I exhorted thee to stay at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge certain persons not to teach other doctrine,
054	1TI	001	004	nor attend to fables and endless genealogies, which occasion debates, rather than pious edification in the faith:
054	1TI	001	005	so do, and acquaint them that the end of that charge is charity, out of a pure heart, and a good conscience, and faith unfeigned:
054	1TI	001	006	from which some having swerved are turned aside to vain discourses;
054	1TI	001	007	desiring to be teachers of the law, though they neither understand what they say, nor what things they assert.
054	1TI	001	008	But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully;
054	1TI	001	009	knowing this, that a law does not lie against a righteous person, but against the lawless and unruly, the impious and wicked, the unholy and profane,
054	1TI	001	010	parricides, murderers, whoremongers, sodomites, kidnappers, liars, false-swearers, and if there be any thing else contrary to that sound doctrine,
054	1TI	001	011	which is according to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, with which I was intrusted.
054	1TI	001	012	And I give thanks to Christ Jesus our Lord, who gave me ability for the work, that He accounted me faithful, having put me into the ministry,
054	1TI	001	013	who before was a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and an oppressor. But I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief: and the grace of our Lord superabounded,
054	1TI	001	014	with faith and love in Christ Jesus.
054	1TI	001	015	It is a truth highly to be believed, and worthy to be received by all, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners: ---of whom I am one of the chief.
054	1TI	001	016	But for this end I obtained mercy, that in me a chief sinner Jesus Christ might display his long-suffering, for an example to those who should afterwards believe on Him to eternal life.
054	1TI	001	017	Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honor and glory for ever and ever. Amen.
054	1TI	001	018	This charge I commit to thee, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which before came on thee, that by them thou mightest war a good warfare,
054	1TI	001	019	having faith and a good conscience, which some putting away have made shipwreck concerning the faith:
054	1TI	001	020	of whom is Hymeneus and Alexander, whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.
054	1TI	002	001	This then I exhort thee first of all, that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings he made for all men;
054	1TI	002	002	particularly for kings, and all that are in authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceful life in all piety and virtue.
054	1TI	002	003	For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour:
054	1TI	002	004	who is willing that all men should be saved, and therefore come to the knowledge of the truth.
054	1TI	002	005	For there is one God, and one Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus:
054	1TI	002	006	who gave himself a ransom for all, a testimony to be published in due time,
054	1TI	002	007	for which I was appointed a herald and an apostle. I speak the truth in Christ, I lie not; I am a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.
054	1TI	002	008	I direct therefore that men pray in every place, lifting up holy hands without wrath and debate:
054	1TI	002	009	likewise that women dress themselves in decent apparel with modesty and prudence, not in braided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly garments;
054	1TI	002	010	but in good works, as becometh women professing godliness.
054	1TI	002	011	Let the woman learn in silence with all submission: but I permit not a woman to teach,
054	1TI	002	012	nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be silent.
054	1TI	002	013	For Adam was formed first, then Eve.
054	1TI	002	014	And Adam was not seduced by the serpent, but the woman being led astray was first in the transgression.
054	1TI	002	015	Yet shall she be saved through childbirth, if they continue in faith and love, in holiness and modesty.
054	1TI	003	001	It is certain, if any one is desirous of the episcopal office, he desireth a good work.
054	1TI	003	002	A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of but one wife, sober, prudent, grave,
054	1TI	003	003	hospitable, able to teach, not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of sordid gain, moderate, not quarrelsome,
054	1TI	003	004	not covetous, governing his own family well, having his children in subjection with all gravity;
054	1TI	003	005	(for if any one know not how to govern his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?)
054	1TI	003	006	not one newly converted, least being puffed up he fall into the condemnation of the devil.
054	1TI	003	007	He ought also to have an honorable testimony from those that are without, least he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.
054	1TI	003	008	The deacons should likewise be grave, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of base gain,
054	1TI	003	009	holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.
054	1TI	003	010	(And let these also first be proved, then let them take the office of deacons, if they be found blameless.)
054	1TI	003	011	And their wives likewise grave, not slanderers, sober, and faithful in all things.
054	1TI	003	012	Let the deacons too be husbands of one wife only, governing their children and their own houses well.
054	1TI	003	013	For they, that discharge the office of a deacon well, gain to themselves a good degree of honor, and much freedom in promoting the faith that is in Christ Jesus.
054	1TI	003	014	These things I write unto thee, hoping to come to thee shortly.
054	1TI	003	015	But if I should be retarded, that thou mayst know how thou oughtest to behave in the house of God, the church of the living God, the pillar and support of the truth.
054	1TI	003	016	And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifested in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen by angels, preached among the Gentiles, believed on in the world, and received up into glory.
054	1TI	004	001	Now the Spirit expressly saith, that in latter times some shall apostatize from the faith, attending to seducing spirits,
054	1TI	004	002	and doctrines of demons founded in the hypocrisy of liars, who are seared in their own conscience, forbidding to marry,
054	1TI	004	003	and enjoining abstinence from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving by those that believe and know the truth.
054	1TI	004	004	For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be rejected, if it be received with thanksgiving:
054	1TI	004	005	for it is sanctified by the word of God and by prayer.
054	1TI	004	006	If thou lay these things before the brethren, thou wilt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, as one brought up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, to which thou hast attained.
054	1TI	004	007	But profane and groundless fables reject, and exercise thyself unto godliness.
054	1TI	004	008	For bodily exercise profiteth little, but piety is profitable unto all things, having the promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come:
054	1TI	004	009	this is a certain truth and worthy of all acceptance.
054	1TI	004	010	For to this end we both labour and suffer reproach, because we have hope in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, especially of the faithful.
054	1TI	004	011	These things declare and teach.
054	1TI	004	012	Let no one have cause to despise thy youth; but he thou an example to believers in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.
054	1TI	004	013	Till I come attend to reading, to exhortation, and teaching.
054	1TI	004	014	Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.
054	1TI	004	015	Meditate on these things, be wholly in them, that thy proficiency may be manifest in all.
054	1TI	004	016	Take heed to thyself, and to thy doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this, thou wilt both save thyself and those that hear thee.
054	1TI	005	001	Do not chide a senior, but exhort him as a father; and younger men as brethren:
054	1TI	005	002	the elder women as mothers, the younger as sisters, with all purity.
054	1TI	005	003	Honour widows who are widows indeed.
054	1TI	005	004	But if any widow have children or grandchildren, let these learn first to shew piety at home, and to make suitable returns to their parents: for this is becoming, and acceptable in the sight of God.
054	1TI	005	005	Now she, that is really a widow and desolate, hopeth in God, and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day.
054	1TI	005	006	But she that indulgeth to luxury, is dead while she liveth.
054	1TI	005	007	These things give in charge, that they may be blameless.
054	1TI	005	008	But if any provide not for his own, and especially for those of his own family, he hath renounced the faith, and is worse than an infidel.
054	1TI	005	009	Let not a widow be chosen into the number under sixty years old,
054	1TI	005	010	having been the wife of one man: in repute for good actions, if she have educated children, if she have entertained strangers, if she have washed the feet of saints, if she have relieved the afflicted, and diligently followed every good work.
054	1TI	005	011	But the younger widows refuse: for when they grow wanton against Christ, they will needs marry:
054	1TI	005	012	and are therefore to be condemned, because they violate their first faith.
054	1TI	005	013	And withal being idle they learn to go about from house to house: and are not only idle, but tatlers also and busy-bodies, talking of things unbecoming them.
054	1TI	005	014	I would therefore have the younger widows marry, bear children, manage houshold affairs, and give no occasion to the adversary for reproach.
054	1TI	005	015	For some are already turned aside after Satan.
054	1TI	005	016	And if any believer have relations widows, let them relieve them, and let not the church be burdened; that it may relieve those that are indeed widows and desolate.
054	1TI	005	017	Let the elders, who preside well, be counted worthy of double honor, especially those that labour in preaching and teaching.
054	1TI	005	018	For the scripture saith, "Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn:" and, "The workman is worthy of his hire."
054	1TI	005	019	Receive not an accusation against an elder, unless from two or three witnesses.
054	1TI	005	020	Those that offend reprove before all, that others also may fear.
054	1TI	005	021	I charge thee before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels, that thou keep to these things without preference of persons, doing nothing with partiality.
054	1TI	005	022	Lay hands on no man precipitately, and be not hereby a partaker in the sins of others. Keep thyself pure.
054	1TI	005	023	Drink no longer water only, but use a little wine with it, for the sake of thy stomach and thy frequent infirmities.
054	1TI	005	024	The sins of some men are notorious, leading as it were to their condemnation; and some more artful they follow after.
054	1TI	005	025	So also the good works of some are manifest; and they that are otherwise cannot be hid.
054	1TI	006	001	Let as many as are servants under the yoke account their own masters worthy of all honor; that the name of God and his doctrine may not be blasphemed:
054	1TI	006	002	and let not those who have believing masters, despise them, because they are brethren; but serve them more readily, because they are faithful and beloved by God, partakers of his grace.
054	1TI	006	003	These things teach and exhort. If any one teach otherwise, and adhere not to the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the doctrine which is according to godliness;
054	1TI	006	004	he is proud, knowing nothing, but is delirious about questions and strifes of words: from which cometh envy, contention, calumnies, wicked suspicions, perverse debates of men corrupted in mind,
054	1TI	006	005	and void of truth, accounting gain to be godliness: from such withdraw thyself.
054	1TI	006	006	But godliness with contentment is great gain.
054	1TI	006	007	For we brought nothing into the world, and it is certain that we can carry nothing out:
054	1TI	006	008	having therefore food and raiment, let us be herewith content.
054	1TI	006	009	But they, that will be rich, fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which plunge men into ruin and perdition.
054	1TI	006	010	For the love of money is the root of all evils, which some coveting after have been led astray from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.
054	1TI	006	011	But do thou, O man of God, flee these things, and follow after righteousness, piety, fidelity, love, patience, meekness.
054	1TI	006	012	Maintain the glorious combat of faith, lay hold on eternal life, to which thou hast been called, and hast made a good profession before many witnesses.
054	1TI	006	013	I charge thee before God, who giveth life to all, and before Christ Jesus who witnessed a good confession before Pontius Pilate,
054	1TI	006	014	that thou keep this commandment, unspotted and blameless, till the appearance of our Lord Jesus Christ;
054	1TI	006	015	which He will manifest in his own times, who is the blessed and only potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords,
054	1TI	006	016	who alone hath immortality, dwelling in light inaccessible, whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honor and power everlasting. Amen.
054	1TI	006	017	Charge them, that are rich in this world, not to be high-minded nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who richly affords us all things for enjoyment: charge them to do good,
054	1TI	006	018	to be rich in good works, to be ready to distribute, willing to communicate;
054	1TI	006	019	treasuring up to themselves a good foundation for the future, that they may obtain eternal life.
054	1TI	006	020	O Timothy, keep that with which thou art entrusted, avoiding profane empty babblings, and the oppositions of science falsely so called:
054	1TI	006	021	which some pretending to, have erred from the faith. Grace be with thee. Amen.

# BOOK	055	2TI	2 Timothy	2 Timothy
055	2TI	001	001	Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of life in Christ Jesus,
055	2TI	001	002	to Timothy my beloved son, grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father, and from Christ Jesus our Lord.
055	2TI	001	003	I give thanks to God, whom I serve as my forefathers did, with a pure conscience, having remembrance of thee continually in my prayers night and day;
055	2TI	001	004	greatly desiring to see thee, (for I remember thy tears,) that I may be filled with joy:
055	2TI	001	005	keeping in memory the unfeigned faith, that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice: and I am persuaded that it dwells in thee also;
055	2TI	001	006	for which cause I remind thee to stir up the gift of God which is in thee through the imposition of my hands.
055	2TI	001	007	For God hath not given us a spirit of fearfulness, but of vigor, and of love, and of prudence.
055	2TI	001	008	Be not therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but bear thy part in the afflictions of the gospel, according to the power of God;
055	2TI	001	009	who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose, and grace bestowed upon us through Christ Jesus, before the world was,
055	2TI	001	010	but now made manifest by the appearance of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and brought life and immortality to light by the gospel: for which I was appointed an herald,
055	2TI	001	011	and an apostle, and a teacher of the gentiles:
055	2TI	001	012	for which cause also I suffer these things; but I am not ashamed: for I know in whom I have trusted, and am persuaded that He is able to keep what I have committed to Him against that day.
055	2TI	001	013	Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard from me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.
055	2TI	001	014	The good thing committed to thee keep, through the Holy Spirit which dwelleth in us.
055	2TI	001	015	Thou knowest that all those of Asia are turned from me, of whom is Phygellus and Hermogenes.
055	2TI	001	016	The Lord shew mercy to the family of Onesiphorus; for he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain: but when he was at Rome,
055	2TI	001	017	he sought for me the more diligently, and found me.
055	2TI	001	018	(The Lord grant that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day!) And how much he ministered to me at Ephesus too, thou knowest full well.
055	2TI	002	001	Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace which is in Christ Jesus:
055	2TI	002	002	and the things which thou hast heard from me, before many witnesses, these commit to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.
055	2TI	002	003	Do thou therefore endure hardship, as becomes a good soldier of Jesus Christ.
055	2TI	002	004	No one, that enters into military service, embarrasseth himself with the affairs of this life, that he may please him who enlisted him.
055	2TI	002	005	And if any one contend in the public games, he gains not the crown unless he contend fairly.
055	2TI	002	006	The husbandman must labour first, in order to partake of the fruits.
055	2TI	002	007	Consider what I say, and the Lord give thee understanding in all things.
055	2TI	002	008	Remember Jesus Christ of the seed of David, who was raised from the dead, according to my gospel:
055	2TI	002	009	for whose sake I suffer trouble even unto bonds, as if I were a malefactor; but the word of God is not bound.
055	2TI	002	010	Therefore I submit to every thing for the sake of the elect, that they also may obtain the salvation which is by Christ Jesus, with eternal glory.
055	2TI	002	011	It is an undoubted truth, if we are dead with Him, we shall also live with Him:
055	2TI	002	012	if we suffer, we shall also reign with Him: if we disown Him, He will also disown us.
055	2TI	002	013	If we are unfaithful, He continueth faithful notwithstanding; He cannot renounce Himself.
055	2TI	002	014	These things remind them of, charging them before the Lord not to contend about words, which is profitable for nothing, and tends to the subversion of the hearers.
055	2TI	002	015	Endeavour to present thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.
055	2TI	002	016	But avoid prophane empty harangues; for they will proceed to more impiety,
055	2TI	002	017	and their discourse will eat like a gangrene. Of whom is Hymeneus and Philetus; who have erred from the truth,
055	2TI	002	018	saying that the resurrection is already past; and subvert the faith of some.
055	2TI	002	019	However, the foundation of God standeth firm, having this inscription, The Lord knoweth them that are his; and, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.
055	2TI	002	020	In a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honor, some for meaner uses.
055	2TI	002	021	If therefore any one purify himself from these corruptions, he shall be a vessel unto honor, sanctified and fitted for the Master's use, being prepared for every good work.
055	2TI	002	022	Flee youthful passions: and follow righteousness, fidelity, love, and peace, with all those that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart:
055	2TI	002	023	but foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they produce quarrels; for the servant of the Lord ought not to wrangle,
055	2TI	002	024	but to be gentle towards all men, ready to teach, patient under injuries,
055	2TI	002	025	with meekness instructing those of different sentiments, not knowing but God may give them repentance to the acknowledgement of the truth;
055	2TI	002	026	and they may awake out of the snare of the devil, who have been captivated by him to his will.
055	2TI	003	001	But this know, that in the last days there will be difficult times;
055	2TI	003	002	for men will be selfish, covetous, arrogant, proud, blasphemers, undutiful to parents, ungrateful, unholy,
055	2TI	003	003	without natural affection, perfidious, false accusers, intemperate, savage, enemies to the good, traitors,
055	2TI	003	004	headstrong, conceited, lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God,
055	2TI	003	005	having a form of godliness, but strangers to the power of it: from such turn away.
055	2TI	003	006	For of these are they who insinuate themselves into families, and captivate weak women, that are laden with sins,
055	2TI	003	007	and led away by various lusts, always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.
055	2TI	003	008	And as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also withstand the truth; being men of corrupt minds, and of no judgement in the faith.
055	2TI	003	009	But they shall not proceed far: for their folly shall be evident to all, as theirs also was.
055	2TI	003	010	But thou art well acquainted with my doctrine, conduct, purpose, faith, long-suffering, charity, patience, persecutions,
055	2TI	003	011	sufferings, which befel me at Antioch, in Iconium, in Lystra; what persecutions I endured, and how the Lord delivered me out of them all.
055	2TI	003	012	And indeed all, that are desirous to live godly in Christ Jesus, shall suffer persecution.
055	2TI	003	013	But wicked men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.
055	2TI	003	014	But continue thou in the things which thou hast learnt, and been assured of, knowing from whom thou hast learned them;
055	2TI	003	015	and that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation, through faith in Christ Jesus: for all scripture is by inspiration from God,
055	2TI	003	016	and is profitable for doctrine, for conviction, for correction, for instruction in righteousness;
055	2TI	003	017	that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly fitted for every good work.
055	2TI	004	001	I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the dead at his appearing, in his kingdom;
055	2TI	004	002	preach the word, be instant both in season and out of season; convince, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering and instruction.
055	2TI	004	003	For the time will come, when they will not bear sound doctrine; but having itching ears, will heap up to themselves teachers after their own hearts:
055	2TI	004	004	and turn away their attention from the truth, and be turned aside to fables.
055	2TI	004	005	But be thou watchful in all things, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, give full proof of thy ministry.
055	2TI	004	006	For I am now going to be sacrificed, and the time of my dissolution is near.
055	2TI	004	007	I have fought the good fight, I have finished my race, I have kept the faith.
055	2TI	004	008	As to what remains, there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give me in that day: and not to me only, but also to all those who have longed for his appearance.
055	2TI	004	009	Endeavour to come to me soon: for Demas hath forsaken me,
055	2TI	004	010	through love of this world, and is gone to Thessalonica; as is Crescens to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia: Luke only is with me.
055	2TI	004	011	Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is useful to me in the ministry.
055	2TI	004	012	And I have sent Tychicus to Ephesus.
055	2TI	004	013	When thou comest, bring with thee the cloke, that I left at Troas with Carpus; and the books, but especially the parchments.
055	2TI	004	014	Alexander the brazier did me many ill turns: the Lord will reward him according to his deeds.
055	2TI	004	015	Of whom do thou also beware: for he hath greatly opposed our doctrine.
055	2TI	004	016	In my first defence no one stood by me, but all men forsook me: God grant it may not be laid to their charge!
055	2TI	004	017	But the Lord stood by me, and strengthened me; that by me the gospel might be fully spread, and that all the nations might hear: and so I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.
055	2TI	004	018	And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me to his heavenly kingdom: to whom be glory throughout all ages. Amen.
055	2TI	004	019	Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the family of Onesiphorus.
055	2TI	004	020	Erastus staid at Corinth, and I left Trophimus sick at Miletus.
055	2TI	004	021	Endeavour therefore to come to me before winter. Eubulus saluteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and indeed all the brethren.
055	2TI	004	022	The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit. Grace be with you all. Amen.

# BOOK	056	TIT	Titus	Titus
056	TIT	001	001	Paul a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, for promoting the faith of God's chosen people, and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness:
056	TIT	001	002	in hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised before all ages;
056	TIT	001	003	and hath in his own times manifested his word, by the preaching, with which I was intrusted according to the commandment of God our Saviour:
056	TIT	001	004	to Titus my son in the common faith, grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.
056	TIT	001	005	For this cause I left thee in Crete, that thou mightest set in order what remained, and ordain elders in every city as I directed thee:
056	TIT	001	006	to wit, if any one be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children, not accused of debauchery, or unruly.
056	TIT	001	007	For a bishop must be blameless as the steward of God, not self-willed, not passionate, not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of sordid gain:
056	TIT	001	008	but hospitable, benevolent, sober, just, holy, temperate;
056	TIT	001	009	holding fast the faithful word, according as he hath been taught, that he may be able both to instruct in sound doctrine, and to convince gainsayers.
056	TIT	001	010	For there are many disorderly persons, vain-talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision; whose mouths must be stopped:
056	TIT	001	011	who subvert whole families, teaching what they ought not, for shameful gain:
056	TIT	001	012	as said one of themselves, a prophet of their own, "The Cretans are always liars, mischievous beasts, sluggish gluttons."
056	TIT	001	013	This testimony is true: for which cause rebuke them sharply, that they may be found in the faith;
056	TIT	001	014	not attending to Jewish fables, and the precepts of men who turn away from the truth.
056	TIT	001	015	To the pure indeed all things are pure; but to the polluted and unbelieving nothing is pure; even their mind and conscience is polluted.
056	TIT	001	016	They profess to know God, but in works deny Him, being abominable and disobedient, and to every thing that is good void of understanding.
056	TIT	002	001	But do thou speak the things which become sound doctrine:
056	TIT	002	002	that aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in the faith, in love, in patience:
056	TIT	002	003	the aged women likewise in behaviour as becometh saints, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of that which is good;
056	TIT	002	004	that they may instruct the young women to be temperate, to love their husbands, to love their children, to be prudent,
056	TIT	002	005	chaste, keepers at home, good, submissive to their husbands, that the word of God may not be evil spoken of.
056	TIT	002	006	Exhort the young men in like manner to be temperate:
056	TIT	002	007	in all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works, with uncorruptness in teaching, gravity, sound doctrine that cannot be condemned;
056	TIT	002	008	that he who opposeth it may be ashamed, having no evil to say of you.
056	TIT	002	009	Exhort servants to submit to their masters, to be obsequious in all things,
056	TIT	002	010	not answering frowardly, not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.
056	TIT	002	011	For the grace of God, that bringeth salvation, hath appeared to all men;
056	TIT	002	012	teaching us that denying ungodliness, and worldly desires, we should live soberly, and righteously, and piously in this present world;
056	TIT	002	013	looking for the blessed hope, and glorious appearance of the great God, and our Saviour, Jesus Christ:
056	TIT	002	014	who gave Himself for us, that He might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify to Himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.
056	TIT	002	015	These things speak, and exhort; and reprove offenders with all authority: that none may despise thee.
056	TIT	003	001	Admonish them to be submissive to governors and magistrates, to obey their orders, and to be ready to every good work;
056	TIT	003	002	to slander no man, to avoid contention, to be gentle, shewing all meekness unto all men.
056	TIT	003	003	For we also were formerly foolish, disobedient, going astray, enslaved to various disorderly appetites and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.
056	TIT	003	004	But when the kindness and love of God our Saviour towards man appeared,
056	TIT	003	005	not for works of righteousness which we had done, but according to his own mercy He saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the holy Spirit;
056	TIT	003	006	which He hath plentifully shed upon us, through Jesus Christ our Saviour:
056	TIT	003	007	that being justified by his grace, we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life.
056	TIT	003	008	This is a word which ought to believed and observed, and concerning these things I would have thee stedfastly affirm, that they who have believed in God be careful to excel in good works: for these things are good and profitable to men.
056	TIT	003	009	But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and strifes and contentions about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain:
056	TIT	003	010	reject therefore such an heretical man, after the first and second admonition; knowing that such a one is perverted,
056	TIT	003	011	and sinneth as being self-condemned.
056	TIT	003	012	When I shall send Artemas to thee, or Tychicus, endeavour to come to me to Nicopolis: for there I have determined to winter.
056	TIT	003	013	Forward Zenas the lawyer, and Apollos, on their journey carefully, that nothing may be wanting to them.
056	TIT	003	014	And let our brethren-also learn to excel in good works for necessary exigencies, that they may not be unfruitful.
056	TIT	003	015	All that are with me salute thee. Salute them that love us in the faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.

057	PHM	001	003	grace and peace be to you from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
057	PHM	001	004	I thank my God always making mention of thee in my prayers,
057	PHM	001	005	(hearing of the faith which thou hast towards the Lord Jesus, and of thy love to all the saints,)
057	PHM	001	006	that the communication of thy faith may become effectual in the acknowledgement of all the good that is in you towards Christ Jesus:
057	PHM	001	007	for we have much joy and comfort in thy love, because by thee, dear brother, the bowels of the saints are refreshed.
057	PHM	001	008	Wherefore though I have sufficient authority in Christ to enjoin thee what is meet,
057	PHM	001	009	I would rather intreat thee out of love to me, being such a one as Paul the aged, and now a prisoner too for the sake of Jesus Christ.
057	PHM	001	010	I intreat thee then for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds,
057	PHM	001	011	who was formerly unprofitable to thee, but now profitable both to thee and to me; whom I have sent back to thee:
057	PHM	001	012	him therefore, as my own bowels, do thou receive.
057	PHM	001	013	Whom I would gladly have kept with me, that he might have ministered unto me as thou wouldst have done, in the bonds of the gospel.
057	PHM	001	014	But I would do nothing without thy knowledge, that thy kindness might not be as it were forced, but voluntary.
057	PHM	001	015	For perhaps he was therefore parted from thee for a season, that thou mightest receive him for ever:

057	PHM	001	018	If he hath wronged thee in any thing, or is indebted to thee, place it to my accompt:
057	PHM	001	019	I Paul have written it with my own hand, I will pay it: not to say that thou indeed owest even thy own self to me.
057	PHM	001	020	Yea, my brother, let me enjoy this satisfaction from thee in the Lord: and thus refresh my bowels in the Lord.
057	PHM	001	021	Being fully persuaded of thy compliance, I have written to thee; knowing that thou wilt indeed do more than I ask.

# BOOK	058	HEB	Hebrews	Hebrews
058	HEB	001	001	God, who at sundry times, and various ways, spake of old unto the fathers by the prophets, hath in these last days spoken to us by his Son,
058	HEB	001	002	whom He hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also He made the worlds.
058	HEB	001	003	Who being the refulgence of his glory and the imprest image of his person, and sustaining all things by his powerful word, having by Himself performed the purging away of our sins, sat down at the right hand of the majesty on high.
058	HEB	001	004	Being as much superior to the angels, as He inheriteth a name more excellent than they.
058	HEB	001	005	For to which of the angels did He ever say, "Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee?" and again, "I will be to Him a Father, and He shall be to me a Son?"
058	HEB	001	006	and when He again introduceth the First-born into the world, he saith, "And let all the angels of God worship Him."
058	HEB	001	007	And as to the angels He saith, "Who maketh his angels spirits and his ministers a flame of fire:"
058	HEB	001	008	but to the Son, "Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever; the sceptre of thy kingdom is a sceptre of righteousness:
058	HEB	001	009	thou lovest righteousness and hatest iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thine associates."
058	HEB	001	010	And in another place, "Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast founded the earth, and the heavens are the works of thy hands:
058	HEB	001	011	they shall perish, but thou remainest; and they shall all grow old as a garment,
058	HEB	001	012	and as a mantle wilt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed; but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail."
058	HEB	001	013	But to which of the angels hath He ever said, "Sit thou at my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool?"
058	HEB	001	014	Are they not all ministring spirits, sent forth to attend on those who shall be heirs of salvation?
058	HEB	002	001	For this reason we ought the more earnestly to attend to what we have heard, least by any means we should be found deficient.
058	HEB	002	002	For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received it's just recompence;
058	HEB	002	003	how shall we escape, if we neglect so great a salvation? which began to be declared by the Lord, and was confirmed to us by them that heard Him;
058	HEB	002	004	God also testifying together with them by signs, and wonders, and divers miracles, and gifts of the holy Spirit, according to his own will.
058	HEB	002	005	For He hath not subjected to angels the world to come, of which we speak.
058	HEB	002	006	But one in a certain place hath testified, saying, "What is man that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man that thou visitest Him?
058	HEB	002	007	Thou madest Him for a little while inferior to the angels; with glory and honor hast thou crowned Him, and hast set Him over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet,"
058	HEB	002	008	For in putting all things under Him, He left nothing which was not to be in subjection to Him: though we do not yet see all things subjected to Him.
058	HEB	002	009	But we see Jesus, who was made for a little while lower than the angels, in order to suffer death, that by the grace of God He might taste death for every man, crowned with glory and honor.
058	HEB	002	010	For it became Him for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the author of their salvation perfect by sufferings:
058	HEB	002	011	since He that sanctifieth, and they that are sanctified, are all of one. For which cause He is not ashamed to call them brethren,
058	HEB	002	012	saying, "I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the congregation will I praise Thee."
058	HEB	002	013	And again, "I will trust in Him:" and again, "Behold, I, and the children which God hath given me."
058	HEB	002	014	Seeing then the children are partakers of flesh and blood, He also himself in like manner partook of them; that by death He might destroy him that had the empire of death, that is, the devil:
058	HEB	002	015	and deliver those who through fear of death were all their life-time subject to bondage.
058	HEB	002	016	For indeed He taketh not hold of angels to save them, but of the seed of Abraham.
058	HEB	002	017	Whence it behoved Him to be made in all things like unto his brethren, that He might be a merciful and faithful high-priest in the things concerning God, to make atonement for the sins of the people:
058	HEB	002	018	for as He himself hath suffered, in being tempted, He is able to succour those that are tempted.
058	HEB	003	001	Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the apostle and high-priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;
058	HEB	003	002	who was faithful to Him that appointed Him, as Moses also was in all his house.
058	HEB	003	003	For He was accounted worthy of more honor than Moses, as he who hath built it, hath more honor than the house.
058	HEB	003	004	For every house is built by some one: and He who built all things is God.
058	HEB	003	005	Now Moses was indeed faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of the things which were to be spoken:
058	HEB	003	006	but Christ as a Son over his own house; whose house we are, if we maintain the free profession and exultation of hope firm unto the end.
058	HEB	003	007	Therefore, as the holy Ghost saith, "To-day if ye will hear his voice,
058	HEB	003	008	harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness, when your fathers tempted me,
058	HEB	003	009	proved me, and saw my works forty years:
058	HEB	003	010	wherefore I was provoked with that generation, and said, They are always erring in their heart, and they have not known my ways:
058	HEB	003	011	so I sware in my wrath, they shall not enter into my rest."
058	HEB	003	012	Take heed, my brethren, least there be in any of you a wicked heart of unbelief in departing from the living God:
058	HEB	003	013	but exhort one another daily, while it is called to-day; that none of you may be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin:
058	HEB	003	014	for we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold fast our first confidence firm unto the end; inasmuch as it is said,
058	HEB	003	015	"To-day if ye will hear his voice,
058	HEB	003	016	harden not your hearts, as in the provocation." For some that heard did provoke; but not all that came out of Egypt with Moses.
058	HEB	003	017	But with whom was He provoked forty years? was it not with those that sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness?
058	HEB	003	018	and to whom did He swear that they should not enter into his rest, but to those that were disobedient?
058	HEB	003	019	and so we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.
058	HEB	004	001	Let us therefore fear least a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of us should seem to fall short of it:
058	HEB	004	002	for we are graciously offered it, as they also were. But the word, which they heard, did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.
058	HEB	004	003	For we who believe shall enter into rest, as He said above, "So I sware in my wrath, they shall not enter into my rest:" though the works of creation were finished from the foundation of the world:
058	HEB	004	004	for it is thus said concerning the seventh day, "And God rested the seventh day from all his works."
058	HEB	004	005	And yet in this place, "They shall not enter into my rest."
058	HEB	004	006	Seeing therefore it remaineth that some are to enter into it, and they to whom it was at first offered did not enter because of their unbelief,
058	HEB	004	007	He appoints a certain day, called To-day, saying by David so long after, (as it is recorded) "To-day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts."
058	HEB	004	008	For if Joshua had given them the rest, He would not afterwards have spoken of another day.
058	HEB	004	009	There remaineth therefore a rest for the people of God:
058	HEB	004	010	for he that is entered into his rest, hath also himself ceased from his works, as God did from his.
058	HEB	004	011	Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, least any one fall after the same example of unbelief.
058	HEB	004	012	For the word of God is lively and efficacious, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit, and of the very joints and marrow, and judging the thoughts and intentions of the heart.
058	HEB	004	013	And there is no creature concealed from his sight: but all things are naked and open to the eyes of Him, to whom we are to give an account.
058	HEB	004	014	Having therefore a great high-priest, that is passed into the heavens, even Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession:
058	HEB	004	015	for we have not an high-priest who cannot sympathize with our infirmities, but was in all respects tempted in like manner with us, yet without sin.
058	HEB	004	016	Let us therefore come with freedom to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace for our seasonable help.
058	HEB	005	001	For every high-priest taken from among men, is appointed for the sake of men in things relating to God, that he may offer gifts and sacrifices for sins:
058	HEB	005	002	who can have due compassion on the ignorant and those that are going astray; seeing he himself also is surrounded with infirmity:
058	HEB	005	003	and for this reason he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer sacrifice for sins.
058	HEB	005	004	And no one taketh this honor to himself, but he that is called by God, as Aaron was.
058	HEB	005	005	So also Christ did not glorify himself to be made an high-priest; but He that said unto Him, "Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee."
058	HEB	005	006	As He saith also in another place, "Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec."
058	HEB	005	007	Who in the days of his flesh, offered prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears, to Him that was able to save Him from death, and was heard in what He feared;
058	HEB	005	008	but though He was a Son, yet He learned obedience by the things which He suffered: and being thus perfected,
058	HEB	005	009	He became the author of eternal salvation to all that obey Him:
058	HEB	005	010	having been declared by God an high-priest after the order of Melchisedec.
058	HEB	005	011	Concerning whom we have much to say and difficult to be explained, since ye are become dull of hearing.
058	HEB	005	012	For whereas ye ought for the time to be teachers of others, ye have need again of some one to teach you the first rudiments of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk and not of solid food.
058	HEB	005	013	For every one that wanteth milk, is unacquainted with the doctrine of justification; for he is an infant:
058	HEB	005	014	but firm food is for persons come to age, who by habit have their senses exercised to a discernment both of good and evil.
058	HEB	006	001	Wherefore omitting the discourse about the first principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us proceed to perfection: not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works,
058	HEB	006	002	and of faith in God, of the doctrine of baptisms, and laying on of hands, and of the resurrection from the dead, and of eternal judgement: (tho' we will do this also, if God permit:)
058	HEB	006	003	for it is impossible that those,
058	HEB	006	004	who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the holy Spirit,
058	HEB	006	005	and of the good word of God,
058	HEB	006	006	and the powers of the gospel-age, and yet fall away, should be renewed again to repentance: since they again crucify to themselves the Son of God, and make an open example of Him.
058	HEB	006	007	For as the earth, which imbibeth the rain that is frequently coming upon it, and produceth herbs fit for those by whom it is cultivated, receiveth a blessing from God:
058	HEB	006	008	but that which bringeth forth thorns and briars, is rejected and near to a curse, (whose end is burning) so are they.
058	HEB	006	009	But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak for your caution.
058	HEB	006	010	For God is not unjust to forget your work and labor of love, which ye have shewn to his name, by having ministred to the saints, and yet ministring.
058	HEB	006	011	And we desire that every one of you would shew the same diligence to acquire the full assurance of hope even unto the end:
058	HEB	006	012	that ye would not be sluggish, but imitators of them who through faith and patience are inheriting the promises.
058	HEB	006	013	For when God made the promise to Abraham, because He could swear by no greater, He sware by Himself, saying,
058	HEB	006	014	"Verily blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee."
058	HEB	006	015	And thus waiting patiently he obtained the promise.
058	HEB	006	016	For men swear by a greater Being, and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all controversy.
058	HEB	006	017	Wherefore God being willing more abundantly to manifest unto the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it with an oath:
058	HEB	006	018	that by two immutable things, in which it is impossible for God to fail, we might have strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold on the hope set before us;
058	HEB	006	019	which we have as an anchor of the soul safe and stedfast, and which entereth within the veil.
058	HEB	006	020	Whither Jesus our fore-runner is entered for us, being made an high-priest for ever, after the order of Melchisedec.
058	HEB	007	001	For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings,
058	HEB	007	002	and blessed him, to whom also Abraham divided the tenth of all his spoils; being in the first place, by interpretation of his name, king of righteousness, and moreover king of Salem, which is king of peace;
058	HEB	007	003	without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days recorded, nor end of life, but resembling the Son of God, remaineth a priest continually.
058	HEB	007	004	Now consider how great a man this was, to whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.
058	HEB	007	005	And those indeed of the sons of Levi, who receive the priesthood, have a commandment according to the law to take tithes of the people, that is, of their brethren, though they came out of the loins of Abraham:
058	HEB	007	006	but he, whose pedigree is not reckoned among them, took tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.
058	HEB	007	007	Now without all contradiction the inferior is blessed by the superior:
058	HEB	007	008	besides, here men that die receive tithes; but there he of whom it is testified that he liveth.
058	HEB	007	009	And (as one may say) even Levi, who receiveth tithes, paid tithes in Abraham:
058	HEB	007	010	for he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him.
058	HEB	007	011	Now if perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law) what farther need was there that another priest should arise after the order of Melchisedec, and not after the order of Aaron?
058	HEB	007	012	For the priesthood being changed, there is of necessity a change also of the law.
058	HEB	007	013	Now He, of whom these things are said, is of another tribe, of which none ever attended at the altar.
058	HEB	007	014	For it is evident that our Lord sprang from Judah, as to which tribe Moses spake nothing about the priesthood.
058	HEB	007	015	And it is yet more abundantly evident, that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest,
058	HEB	007	016	who is made not according to the law of a temporary command, but according to the power of an endless life.
058	HEB	007	017	For He testifieth, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.
058	HEB	007	018	For there is indeed a disannulling of the preceding command, on account of it's weakness and unprofitableness;
058	HEB	007	019	for the law made nothing perfect, but the introducing of a better hope did, by which we draw near to God.
058	HEB	007	020	Moreover inasmuch as He was not made priest without an oath,
058	HEB	007	021	(for they indeed are become priests without the solemnity of an oath; but He with an oath, by Him who said unto Him, "The Lord hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:")
058	HEB	007	022	by so much is Jesus become the surety of a better covenant.
058	HEB	007	023	And they were many priests, because they were by death hindered from continuing in their office;
058	HEB	007	024	but He, because He abideth for ever, hath a priesthood that passeth not to any other:
058	HEB	007	025	wherefore also He is able to save to the uttermost, those that come unto God by Him, seeing He ever liveth to make intercession for them.
058	HEB	007	026	For such an high-priest was meet for us, who was holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and higher than the heavens;
058	HEB	007	027	who hath no need, as the Levitical high-priests had, daily to offer sacrifices first for his own sins, and then for those of the people: for this He did once for all, in offering up Himself.
058	HEB	007	028	For the law appointeth men high-priests, who have infirmity; but the oath, recorded since the law, appointeth the Son to be priest for ever, being fully perfected for it.
058	HEB	008	001	Now the sum of the things that have been said is this, that we have such an high-priest, who is sat down at the right hand of the throne of the majesty in the heavens;
058	HEB	008	002	a minister of holy things, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord hath raised, and not man.
058	HEB	008	003	For every high-priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices; wherefore it was necessary that He also should have something to offer.
058	HEB	008	004	For if He were on earth, He could not be a priest, seeing there are priests already that offer gifts according to the law:
058	HEB	008	005	who worship under the representation and shadow of heavenly things; as Moses was ordered by God, when he was about to finish the tabernacle. For see, saith He, that thou make all according to the model shewn thee in the mount.
058	HEB	008	006	But now He hath obtained a more excellent ministry, inasmuch as He is also the mediator of a better covenant, which is established upon better promises.
058	HEB	008	007	For if the first covenant had been unexceptionable, there had been no room for a second:
058	HEB	008	008	as we see there was, for after complaining of them, He adds, "Behold the days come, saith the Lord, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:
058	HEB	008	009	not according to the covenant which I made with their fathers, in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; for they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.
058	HEB	008	010	But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their mind, and I will inscribe them on their hearts; and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people.
058	HEB	008	011	And they shall not teach every one his neighbour, and every one his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for they shall all know me, from the lest even to the greatest of them.
058	HEB	008	012	For I will forgive their crimes, and their sins and their iniquities I will remember no more."
058	HEB	008	013	Now by saying, a new covenant, He hath antiquated the first: and what is antiquated, and groweth old, is near it's exit.
058	HEB	009	001	Therefore the first covenant had also rites of worship and a worldly sanctuary.
058	HEB	009	002	For there was a tabernacle prepared; the first part, wherein was the candlestick, and the table, and the loaves set on it, which is called the sanctuary.
058	HEB	009	003	And beyond the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holy of holies, having the golden censer,
058	HEB	009	004	and the ark of the covenant which was overlaid all round with gold, and in which was the golden pot with the manna in it, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;
058	HEB	009	005	and over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat: of which it is not necessary now to speak particularly.
058	HEB	009	006	Now these things being thus disposed, the priests always went into the first part of the tabernacle to perform their daily services:
058	HEB	009	007	but into the second only the high-priest went once a year; and that not without blood, which he offered for himself, and for the sins of the people committed through ignorance.
058	HEB	009	008	The Holy Ghost shewing by this, that the way into the Holy of holies was not yet manifested, the first tabernacle being yet standing.
058	HEB	009	009	Which figure remains to the present time, wherein gifts and sacrifices are offered, that cannot perfect the worshipper as to his conscience,
058	HEB	009	010	relating only to meats and drinks, and different washings, and such carnal ordinances as were required till the time of reformation.
058	HEB	009	011	But Christ being come an high-priest of the good things to come, hath entered once for all into the holy places, through a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is, not of this building,
058	HEB	009	012	nor by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood, having obtained eternal redemption for us.
058	HEB	009	013	For if the blood of bulls and goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purification of the flesh;
058	HEB	009	014	how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself spotless to God, purify your conscience from dead works, that ye may serve the living God?
058	HEB	009	015	And on this account He is the mediator of a new covenant, that undergoing death for the redemption of transgressions against the first covenant, they that are called might receive the promise of an eternal inheritance.
058	HEB	009	016	For where a testament is, there is a necessity of proving the death of the testator.
058	HEB	009	017	For a testament is valid after men are dead, but is of no force while the testator is living.
058	HEB	009	018	Whence neither was the first covenant entered into without blood:
058	HEB	009	019	for when every command was spoken according to the law, by Moses to all the people, he took the blood of calves and goats, with water and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled the book and all the people,
058	HEB	009	020	saying, this is the blood of the covenant, which God hath enjoined you.
058	HEB	009	021	And the tabernacle, and all the vessels of public worship he likewise sprinkled with blood.
058	HEB	009	022	And according to the law almost all things are purified with blood; and without shedding of blood there is no remission.
058	HEB	009	023	It was therefore necessary that the representations of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with more excellent sacrifices than these.
058	HEB	009	024	For Christ is not entered into holy places made with hands, which were but types of the true ones; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:
058	HEB	009	025	nor to offer Himself often, as the high-priest entereth into the holy of holies every year with the blood of others;
058	HEB	009	026	(for then He must indeed have suffered often since the foundation of the world) but now once at the conclusion of the ages He hath been made manifest for the abolishing of sin by the sacrifice of himself.
058	HEB	009	027	And as it is appointed to men once to die, and after this the judgement;
058	HEB	009	028	so Christ, having been once offered to bear the sins of many, shall appear the second time without sin, to those who are waiting for Him, unto salvation.
058	HEB	010	001	For the law having but a faint shadow of good things to come, and not the full image of the things, can never, even by the great annual sacrifices which they offer statedly, make the comers thereunto perfect.
058	HEB	010	002	For then they would have ceased to be offered, because the sacrificers, being once purified, would no longer retain any consciousness of sins.
058	HEB	010	003	Whereas in these very sacrifices there is a recalling of sins to mind every year.
058	HEB	010	004	For it is impossible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.
058	HEB	010	005	Wherefore upon his coming into the world He saith, "Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire, but a body hast thou prepared me:
058	HEB	010	006	in whole burnt-offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hadst no pleasure:
058	HEB	010	007	then said I, Lo I come, as in the volume of the book it is written of me, to do thy will, O God."
058	HEB	010	008	Having said before, "Thou didst not desire, nor hadst pleasure in, sacrifice and offering, and whole burnt-offerings, and sacrifices for sin," (which are offered by the law) then He adds,
058	HEB	010	009	"Lo I come to do thy will, O God." (He taketh away the first, that He may establish the second.)
058	HEB	010	010	By which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.
058	HEB	010	011	And indeed every priest under the law standeth daily ministring, and frequently offering the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:
058	HEB	010	012	but He having offered one sacrifice for sins, is for ever sat down at the right hand of God;
058	HEB	010	013	waiting for the future, till his enemies be put under his feet.
058	HEB	010	014	For by one offering He hath perfected for ever those that are sanctified.
058	HEB	010	015	And of this the holy Ghost also beareth witness with us:
058	HEB	010	016	for after He had said, "This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and on their minds will I inscribe them;
058	HEB	010	017	He adds, and their sins and their iniquities I will remember no more."
058	HEB	010	018	Now where there is such a remission of these, there needs no more offering for sin.
058	HEB	010	019	Having therefore, brethren, free admission into the holy places by the blood of Jesus,
058	HEB	010	020	the new and living way which He hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say,
058	HEB	010	021	his flesh, and having a great high-priest over the house of God,
058	HEB	010	022	let us draw near with sincerity, in the full assurance of faith, having our hearts cleansed from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.
058	HEB	010	023	Let us inflexibly retain the profession of our hope,
058	HEB	010	024	(for He is faithful who hath promised) and let us observe each other to the incitement of love and good works:
058	HEB	010	025	not forsaking our assemblies, as the custom of some is, but exhorting one another; and so much the more as ye see the day approaching.
058	HEB	010	026	For if we sin wilfully after having received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins;
058	HEB	010	027	but a dreadful expectation of judgement, and a fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.
058	HEB	010	028	If any one that violateth the law of Moses, dieth without mercy under two or three witnesses,
058	HEB	010	029	of how much greater punishment, think ye, shall he be counted worthy, who hath trampled under foot the Son of God, and accounted the blood of the covenant, by which he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and abused the Spirit of grace?
058	HEB	010	030	For we know who hath said, "To me belongeth vengeance, I will recompense, saith the Lord:" and again, "The Lord will judge his people."
058	HEB	010	031	It is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
058	HEB	010	032	But call to remembrance the former days, in which after being enlightened, ye sustained a great conflict of sufferings;
058	HEB	010	033	partly, being made a public spectacle by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, as ye became associates of those who were so treated:
058	HEB	010	034	for ye sympathized with me in my bonds, and ye took joyfully the plundering of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance.
058	HEB	010	035	Cast not away therefore your couragious profession, which hath a great recompence of reward.
058	HEB	010	036	For ye have need of patience, that having done the will of God ye may receive the promise.
058	HEB	010	037	For yet a little while, and He, that is coming, will come, and will not delay:
058	HEB	010	038	and the just shall live by faith, but if any draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.
058	HEB	010	039	But we are not of those who withdraw to perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.
058	HEB	011	001	Now faith is the confident expectation of things hoped for, and a conviction of things not seen:
058	HEB	011	002	for by it the ancients obtained an honorable testimony.
058	HEB	011	003	By faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, for the things which are seen were not made of things which appear.
058	HEB	011	004	By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained the testimony that he was righteous, God bearing witness to his gifts: and by it, though dead, he yet speaketh.
058	HEB	011	005	By faith Enoch was translated, that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him; for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God:
058	HEB	011	006	whereas without faith it is impossible to please Him; for he that cometh to God must believe, that He is, and is the rewarder of them that diligently seek Him.
058	HEB	011	007	By faith Noah being warned by God of things which were not yet seen, moved with pious fear, prepared an ark for the safety of his family; whereby he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.
058	HEB	011	008	By faith Abraham when called to go out to a place which he was afterwards to receive for an inheritance obeyed: and went out, though he knew not whither he was going.
058	HEB	011	009	By faith he sojourned in the land promised him, as in a foreign country, dwelling in tents, as did Isaac and Jacob the heirs with him of the same promise.
058	HEB	011	010	For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose maker and founder is God.
058	HEB	011	011	By faith also Sarah received strength to conceive seed, and brought forth a son when she was past age, because she accounted Him faithful who had promised.
058	HEB	011	012	So that there descended even from one, and him in a manner dead, a posterity like the stars of heaven for multitude, and as the sand on the sea shore, innumerable.
058	HEB	011	013	These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but seen them from afar, and been persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and sojourners on the earth.
058	HEB	011	014	Now they that say such things shew plainly that they are seeking their own country:
058	HEB	011	015	and if they had been mindful of that from which they came, they might have had opportunity to have returned.
058	HEB	011	016	But they desire a better, that is, an heavenly one; wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God; for He hath prepared for them a city.
058	HEB	011	017	By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he who had received the promises, offered up his only son;
058	HEB	011	018	of whom it was told him, that in Isaac shall thy seed be called:
058	HEB	011	019	concluding that God was able to raise him even from the dead; from whence indeed he had in a manner received him.
058	HEB	011	020	By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things future.
058	HEB	011	021	By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph; and worshipped leaning on the top of his staff.
058	HEB	011	022	By faith Joseph when he died, mentioned the departure of the children of Israel and gave a charge concerning his bones.
058	HEB	011	023	By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months by his parents, because they saw he was a fine child, and they were not afraid of the king's edict.
058	HEB	011	024	By faith Moses, when he was grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter;
058	HEB	011	025	chusing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to have the temporary enjoyment of sin:
058	HEB	011	026	esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt, for he looked to the recompence of reward.
058	HEB	011	027	By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he continued firm as seeing Him who is invisible.
058	HEB	011	028	By faith he observed the passover and sprinkling of the blood, that he, who destroyed the first-born of the Egyptians, might not touch them.
058	HEB	011	029	By faith they passed through the Red-sea, as by dry land, which the Egyptians attempting to do were drowned.
058	HEB	011	030	By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they had been encompassed seven days.
058	HEB	011	031	By faith Rahab the harlot perished not with the unbelievers, having received the spies with peace.
058	HEB	011	032	And what need I say more? for the time would fail me to tell of Gideon, and Barak, and Sampson, and Jephthah, and David, and Samuel, and of the prophets:
058	HEB	011	033	who by faith subdued kingdoms, worked righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,
058	HEB	011	034	quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, from weakness were made powerful, became strong in battle, and turned to flight the armies of their enemies.
058	HEB	011	035	Women received their dead raised to life again; and others were tortured to death, not accepting deliverance, that they might obtain a better resurrection.
058	HEB	011	036	And others had the trial of mockings and scourgings, and of bonds too and imprisonment.
058	HEB	011	037	They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain by the sword: they went about in sheep-skins, and goat-skins, being destitute, afflicted,
058	HEB	011	038	distressed, (of whom the world was not worthy) wandering in deserts, and mountains, and dens, and caves of the earth.
058	HEB	011	039	And these all, though they obtained an honorable testimony by faith, yet received not the promise;
058	HEB	011	040	God having provided something better concerning us, that without us they might not be made perfect.
058	HEB	012	001	Having therefore so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, let us lay aside every incumbrance, and the sin that easily besets us, and run with patience the race that is set before us,
058	HEB	012	002	looking unto Jesus the leader and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.
058	HEB	012	003	Wherefore consider Him who endured such contradiction of sinners against Himself, that ye may not give out, fainting in your minds:
058	HEB	012	004	for ye have not resisted unto blood in striving against sin.
058	HEB	012	005	Have ye forgotten the exhortation, which speaketh to you as to sons, saying, "My son, despise not the chastening of the Lord, nor saint when rebuked by Him?
058	HEB	012	006	for whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom He receiveth."
058	HEB	012	007	If ye endure chastening, God treateth you as sons; for what son is there, whom the father doth not chastise?
058	HEB	012	008	But if ye be without chastisement, of which all are partakers, then are ye bastards and not sons.
058	HEB	012	009	Now if we had fathers of our flesh, who corrected us, and we gave them reverence; shall we not much more be in subjection to the Father of spirits, and live?
058	HEB	012	010	For they indeed corrected us for a while, as seemed good to them; but He for our profit, that we may be partakers of his holiness.
058	HEB	012	011	Now no chastening seems for the present to be matter of joy but of grief: and yet afterwards it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness to those that are exercised thereby.
058	HEB	012	012	Lift up therefore the hands that hang down, and strengthen the feeble knees.
058	HEB	012	013	And make strait paths for your feet, that what is lame may not be turned out of the way, but rather be healed.
058	HEB	012	014	Follow peace with all men; and holiness, without which none shall see the Lord:
058	HEB	012	015	looking to it, least there be any one falling short of the grace of God, least any root of bitterness springing up should be troublesome, and by it many be defiled:
058	HEB	012	016	least there be any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one repast gave away his birthright.
058	HEB	012	017	For ye know that, when he would afterwards have inherited the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no room for repentance, though he sought it earnestly even with tears.
058	HEB	012	018	Ye are not come to a tangible mountain, and burning fire, and a thick cloud, and darkness, and tempest,
058	HEB	012	019	and the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words, which they that heard, intreated that the word might not any more be thus delivered to them:
058	HEB	012	020	(for they could not bear the strict command, if so much as a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or shot through with a dart;
058	HEB	012	021	and so terrible was the appearance that Moses said, I exceedingly fear and tremble:)
058	HEB	012	022	but ye are come to mount Sion, and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to myriads of angels,
058	HEB	012	023	to the general assembly and church of the first-born who are written in heaven, and to God the judge of all, and to the spirits of the just made perfect,
058	HEB	012	024	and to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than Abel.
058	HEB	012	025	See that ye reject not Him that speaketh; for if they escaped not, who rejected him that gave forth divine oracles on earth, much less shall we, if we turn away from Him that speaketh from heaven:
058	HEB	012	026	whose voice then shook the earth; but now He hath promised, saying, "Yet once more I shake not only the earth, but also the heaven."
058	HEB	012	027	Now this expression "yet once more" signifieth the removing of the things that are shaken, as of things which had been appointed only for a season, that those which cannot be shaken may remain.
058	HEB	012	028	Wherefore since we receive a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us have grace whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and holy fear:
058	HEB	012	029	for our God is a consuming fire.
058	HEB	013	001	Let brotherly love continue.
058	HEB	013	002	Be not forgetful of hospitality; for thereby some have entertained angels, not knowing it.
058	HEB	013	003	Remember those that are in bonds, as if bound with them: and those that suffer evil as being yourselves also in the body.
058	HEB	013	004	Marriage is honorable in all, and the bed is not defiled: but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.
058	HEB	013	005	Let your conversation be free from covetousness, and be contented with what ye have: for He hath said, I will not leave thee; I will never, never forsake thee.
058	HEB	013	006	So that we may say with courage, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.
058	HEB	013	007	Remember your guides, who spake the word of God to you; whose faith imitate, considering the happy end of their conversation.
058	HEB	013	008	Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, to day, and for ever:
058	HEB	013	009	be not then carried about by various and strange doctrines; for it is good that the heart be established by grace, and not in meats, in which those that have been most exact, have not profited by them.
058	HEB	013	010	We have an altar, of which those who perform service in the tabernacle have no right to eat.
058	HEB	013	011	As the bodies of those animals, whose blood being offered for sin is brought into the holy place by the high-priest, are not eaten, but are burnt without the camp.
058	HEB	013	012	Wherefore Jesus also, that He might sanctify the people by his own blood, suffered without the gate.
058	HEB	013	013	Let us then go out unto Him without the camp, bearing his reproach: for we have here no continuing city,
058	HEB	013	014	but are seeking that which is to come.
058	HEB	013	015	By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name.
058	HEB	013	016	But to do good and to communicate forget not; for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.
058	HEB	013	017	Be ruled by those that are your guides, and submit to them: for they watch for your souls; (as those that must give an account) that they may do it with joy and not with uneasiness: for this were unprofitable for you.
058	HEB	013	018	Pray for us; for we are confident that we have a good conscience, desiring in all things to behave well.
058	HEB	013	019	And I the more earnestly intreat you to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner.
058	HEB	013	020	Now the God of peace, who brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, the great shepherd of the sheep, by the blood of the everlasting covenant,
058	HEB	013	021	make you perfect in every good work, to do his will, working in you that which is well-pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
058	HEB	013	022	I beseech you, brethren, bear with this word of exhortation: as I have written to you in brief.
058	HEB	013	023	Know that our brother Timothy is set at liberty, with whom (if he come soon) I will see you.
058	HEB	013	024	Salute all that preside over you, yea and all the saints. They of Italy salute you.
058	HEB	013	025	Grace be with you all. Amen.

059	JAM	001	001	James a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes in dispersion sendeth greeting.
059	JAM	001	002	Account it all joy, my brethren, when ye fall into various trials:
059	JAM	001	003	knowing this, that the trial of your faith worketh patience;
059	JAM	001	004	but let patience have it's perfect work, that ye may be entirely perfect, failing in nothing.
059	JAM	001	005	And if any of you lack wisdom, let him ask it of God, who giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not, and it shall be given him.
059	JAM	001	006	But let him ask in faith, nothing doubting; for he that doubteth is like a wave of the sea blown about and tossed by the wind.
059	JAM	001	007	Let not that man think that he shall receive any thing from the Lord.
059	JAM	001	008	A double-minded man is inconstant in all his ways.
059	JAM	001	009	Let the brother that is low rejoice in his exaltation: but the rich in his humiliation,
059	JAM	001	010	because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.
059	JAM	001	011	For when the sun is risen with it's sultry heat, it drieth up the grass, and the flower of, it falleth, and the beauty of it's appearance is lost: so shall the rich man fade away in his projects.
059	JAM	001	012	Happy is the man who sustaineth temptation; for being approved he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love Him.
059	JAM	001	013	Let no one that is tempted say, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted by evils, and He tempteth no one.
059	JAM	001	014	But every man is tempted, when drawn aside and insnared by his own vehement desire.
059	JAM	001	015	Then desire having conceived bringeth forth sin, and sin when it is finished bringeth forth death.
059	JAM	001	016	Be not therefore deceived, my beloved brethren: for every good gift,
059	JAM	001	017	and every perfect gift, but no evil one, is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation, nor shadow of turning:
059	JAM	001	018	who hath of his own will begotten us by the word of truth, that we might be a kind of first-fruits of his creatures.
059	JAM	001	019	Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:
059	JAM	001	020	for the wrath of man doth not practise the righteousness of God.
059	JAM	001	021	Laying aside therefore all filthiness, and excess of malice, receive with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls.
059	JAM	001	022	But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves.
059	JAM	001	023	For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like a man beholding his natural face in a mirror,
059	JAM	001	024	who beheld himself, and went away, and immediately forgot what manner of man he was.
059	JAM	001	025	But he that looketh well into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.
059	JAM	001	026	If any among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his heart, this man's devotion is vain.
059	JAM	001	027	Pure and uncorrupt religion before God and our Father is this, to take care of orphans and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.
059	JAM	002	001	My brethren, hold not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, in a partial respect of persons.
059	JAM	002	002	For if there come into your synagogue a man with a gold ring in fine clothes, and there come in also a poor man in a mean habit;
059	JAM	002	003	and ye turn your eyes toward him that weareth the fine clothes, and say to him, Sit thou here in an honorable place; and say to the poor man, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool:
059	JAM	002	004	do ye not make a partial difference within yourselves, and become judges that reason wickedly?
059	JAM	002	005	Hear, my beloved brethren; hath not God chosen the poor of this world who are rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom, which He hath promised to them that love Him? but ye have slighted the poor.
059	JAM	002	006	Do not the rich tyrannize over you; and drag you to their tribunals?
059	JAM	002	007	Do they not blaspheme the glorious name by which ye are called?
059	JAM	002	008	If ye fulfil the royal law, according to the scripture, which saith, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well.
059	JAM	002	009	But if ye partially respect persons, ye commit sin, being convicted by the law as transgressors.
059	JAM	002	010	For whosoever shall keep the whole law besides, but offend in one point, he is under the penalty of all:
059	JAM	002	011	for He that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou do not commit adultery, but committest murder, thou art a transgressor of the law.
059	JAM	002	012	So speak, and so act, as those who are to be judged by the law of liberty.
059	JAM	002	013	For he shall have judgement without mercy, that hath not shewn mercy: but mercy triumpheth over judgement.
059	JAM	002	014	What is the advantage, my brethren, if any one say that he has faith, and he hath not works, can faith alone save him?
059	JAM	002	015	If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food;
059	JAM	002	016	and one of you say to them, Go in peace, be ye warmed and be ye filled: but ye give them not the necessaries of life, what profit is it to them?
059	JAM	002	017	so faith, if it have not works, being alone, is dead.
059	JAM	002	018	But one may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith by thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.
059	JAM	002	019	Thou believest that there is one God; thou dost well: the devils also believe and tremble.
059	JAM	002	020	But desirest thou to know, O vain man, that faith without works, is dead?
059	JAM	002	021	consider, Was not our father Abraham justified by works, when he offered his son Isaac upon the altar?
059	JAM	002	022	Thou seest that faith co-operated with his works, and that by his works his faith was perfected.
059	JAM	002	023	And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness; and he was called the friend of God.
059	JAM	002	024	Ye see then that a man is justified by works, and not by faith only.
059	JAM	002	025	And in like manner also was not the harlot Rahab justified by works, when she entertained the spies, and let them out another way?
059	JAM	002	026	For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.
059	JAM	003	001	My brethren, be not many teachers, knowing that we who are such shall pass a stricter trial than others: for in many things we all offend;
059	JAM	003	002	and if any offend not in word, he is a compleat man, able to manage also the whole body.
059	JAM	003	003	Behold we put bridles into the mouths of horses, that they may obey us, and we turn their whole body as we please.
059	JAM	003	004	Behold also the ships which are of so great bulk, and even when they are driven by hard winds, yet are turned about by a very small helm which way soever the pilot pleaseth.
059	JAM	003	005	So the tongue is a small part of the body, yet boasteth great things. Behold how much fuel a little fire kindleth!
059	JAM	003	006	And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our several parts, defiling the whole body, inflaming the course of nature, and is set on fire by hell.
059	JAM	003	007	For every kind of wild beasts, and birds, and reptiles, and fishes, is tamed and hath been tamed by mankind:
059	JAM	003	008	but the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.
059	JAM	003	009	With it we bless God even the Father; and with it we curse men, who are made after the likeness of God:
059	JAM	003	010	out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. These things, my brethren, ought not so to be.
059	JAM	003	011	Does a fountain from the same opening send forth sweet water and bitter?
059	JAM	003	012	Can a fig-tree, my brethren, produce olives, or a vine figs? so can no fountain produce salt water and sweet.
059	JAM	003	013	Is there any wise and understanding man among you? let him shew his works by a good conversation in the meekness of wisdom:
059	JAM	003	014	but if ye have bitter envy and strife in your hearts, do not boast and lie against the truth;
059	JAM	003	015	this is not the wisdom, that cometh down from above, but is earthly, sensual, and diabolical:
059	JAM	003	016	for where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work.
059	JAM	003	017	But the wisdom that is from above first is pure, then peaceable, mild, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality and without hypocrisy.
059	JAM	003	018	And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace for those that promote peace.
059	JAM	004	001	Whence come wars and fightings among you? Come they not hence? even of your carnal appetites making war in your bodies?
059	JAM	004	002	Ye desire, and ye have not: ye are envious, and jealous, and cannot obtain: ye fight and contend; but ye have not, because ye ask not.
059	JAM	004	003	Ye ask and receive not, because ye ask wickedly; that ye may spend it in your pleasures.
059	JAM	004	004	Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity to God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God.
059	JAM	004	005	Do ye think the scripture speaks in vain? or does the Spirit that dwelleth in us, excite to envy?
059	JAM	004	006	No, He giveth more grace: wherefore it is said, God resisteth the proud, but sheweth favor to the humble.
059	JAM	004	007	Submit yourselves therefore to God: resist the devil, and he will flee from you.
059	JAM	004	008	Draw near to God, and He will draw near to you: cleanse your hands, O sinners, and purify your hearts, ye double minded.
059	JAM	004	009	Be grieved, and mourn, and weep: let your mirth be turned into mourning, and your joy to sadness.
059	JAM	004	010	Be humbled before the Lord, and He will exalt you.
059	JAM	004	011	Speak not against one another, my brethren; he that speaketh against his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh against the law, and judgeth the law; but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.
059	JAM	004	012	Now there is but one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou then that judgest another?
059	JAM	004	013	Come now, ye that say, To-day or to-morrow we will go to such a city, and spend a year there, and trade and get gain;
059	JAM	004	014	(though ye know not what will be on the morrow; for what is your life? a vapor, which appeareth for a little while, and then vanisheth away:) whereas ye ought to say,
059	JAM	004	015	If the Lord will, and we should live, and do this or that:
059	JAM	004	016	but ye glory in your presumption: all such glorying is wicked.
059	JAM	004	017	To him therefore that knoweth to do good, and doth it not, to him it is sin.
059	JAM	005	001	Weep now, ye rich men, and howl for your miseries which are coming upon you.
059	JAM	005	002	Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are moth-eaten:
059	JAM	005	003	your gold and silver is cankered, and their rust shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh like fire: ye have been treasuring them up for these last days.
059	JAM	005	004	Behold the hire of the laborers, that reaped your fields, of which they are defrauded by you, crieth out against you: and the complaints of the reapers are come into the ears of the Lord of hosts.
059	JAM	005	005	Ye have lived upon earth delicately and luxuriously; ye fattened your hearts as in a day of slaughter.
059	JAM	005	006	Ye have condemned, ye have murdered the just one, who resisted you not.
059	JAM	005	007	Wait patiently therefore, my brethren, till the coming of the Lord: behold the husbandman expecteth the precious fruit of the earth, waiting patiently for it, till he receive the former and the latter rain.
059	JAM	005	008	Be ye also patient, establish your hearts; for the coming of the Lord is near.
059	JAM	005	009	Repine not, my brethren, against each other, that ye be not condemned: behold, the judge is at the door.
059	JAM	005	010	Take for an example of enduring evil and of long-suffering the prophets, who spake in the name of the Lord.
059	JAM	005	011	Behold, we account those happy, that are patient. Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord, that the Lord is very compassionate and merciful.
059	JAM	005	012	But above all, my brethren, swear not; neither by heaven, nor by the earth, nor any other oath: but let your yea be yea, and your nay nay; that ye may not fall under condemnation.
059	JAM	005	013	Is any among you afflicted? let him pray: is any chearful? let him sing psalms.
059	JAM	005	014	Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:
059	JAM	005	015	and the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord will raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.
059	JAM	005	016	Confess your faults one to another, and pray for one another, that ye may be healed: the fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.
059	JAM	005	017	Elias was a man of like passions with us, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain, and it rained not upon the land for three years and six months:
059	JAM	005	018	and he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth put forth its fruit.
059	JAM	005	019	Brethren, if any among you be seduced from the truth, and one convert him;
059	JAM	005	020	let him know that he, who turneth back a sinner from the error of his way, shall save a soul from death, and shall cover a multitude of sins.

# BOOK	060	1PE	1 Peter	1 Peter
060	1PE	001	001	Peter an apostle of Jesus Christ to the strangers who are dispersed through Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia,
060	1PE	001	002	Asia, and Bithynia, chosen according to the fore-knowledge of God, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience, and to the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ, ---may grace and peace be multiplied unto you.
060	1PE	001	003	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to his abundant mercy hath regenerated us to a lively hope, by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,
060	1PE	001	004	to an inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, and unfading, reserved in heaven for you,
060	1PE	001	005	who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.
060	1PE	001	006	In which ye rejoice, tho' now for a little while, if need be, ye are grieved through various trials.
060	1PE	001	007	That the proof of your faith, which is much more precious than of gold, (that perisheth, though tried by fire) may be found unto praise, and honor, and glory, when Jesus Christ shall be revealed:
060	1PE	001	008	whom having not seen ye love; in whom, though now ye see Him not, yet believing ye rejoice with joy ineffable and full of glory; receiving the end of your faith,
060	1PE	001	009	even the salvation of your souls:
060	1PE	001	010	concerning which salvation the prophets, who prophesied of the grace to be conferred on you, enquired and diligently sought after it:
060	1PE	001	011	searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ in them did declare in testifying beforehand the sufferings that were to come upon Christ, and the glories following them:
060	1PE	001	012	to whom it was revealed, that it was not to themselves, but to us they ministered these things, which are now declared unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you, through the holy Spirit sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.
060	1PE	001	013	Wherefore girding up the loins of your mind, be sober, and stedfastly hope for the grace to be conferred upon you at the appearing of Jesus Christ;
060	1PE	001	014	as children of obedience, not conforming yourselves to the former lusts in your ignorance:
060	1PE	001	015	but as He who hath called you is holy, be ye also holy in all your conversation: since it is written,
060	1PE	001	016	Be ye holy, for I am holy.
060	1PE	001	017	And if ye call upon the Father, who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man's work, pass the time of your sojourning here in fear:
060	1PE	001	018	knowing that ye were redeemed from your vain conversation learned by tradition from your fathers, not with corruptible things, as silver and gold;
060	1PE	001	019	but with the precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:
060	1PE	001	020	who was indeed appointed before the foundation of the world, but manifested in these last times, for your sakes,
060	1PE	001	021	who through Him trust in God that raised Him from the dead, and gave Him glory, that your faith and hope might be fixed in God.
060	1PE	001	022	Having therefore purified your souls by obedience to the truth, through the Spirit, to brotherly love unfeigned, love one another with a pure heart fervently:
060	1PE	001	023	being regenerated not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God which liveth and abideth for ever.
060	1PE	001	024	For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass: the grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away;
060	1PE	001	025	but the word of the Lord abideth for ever. And this is the word which is preached to you in the gospel.
060	1PE	002	001	Therefore laying aside all malice, and all deceit, and hypocrisies,
060	1PE	002	002	and envies, and all evil-speakings, as new-born babes desire that rational milk which is without guile, that ye may grow thereby:
060	1PE	002	003	for ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious;
060	1PE	002	004	to whom coming as to a living stone, rejected indeed by men, but chosen of God,
060	1PE	002	005	and precious, ye also are built up as living stones, a spiritual house, an holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.
060	1PE	002	006	Whence also it is said in scripture, Behold I lay in Sion a chief corner-stone, choice and precious: and he that confideth on it shall not be ashamed.
060	1PE	002	007	To you therefore who believe it is precious: but to them that are disobedient, the stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner,
060	1PE	002	008	and a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence. These stumble at the word through unbelief, unto which also they were appointed.
060	1PE	002	009	But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should declare the glories of Him, who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light:
060	1PE	002	010	who heretofore were not a people, but are now the people of God: who had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.
060	1PE	002	011	Dearly beloved, I exhort you as strangers and sojourners here, to abstain from carnal lusts, which war against the soul:
060	1PE	002	012	having a good conversation among the Gentiles; that whereas they speak against you as evil-doers, they may glorify God in the day of their visitation, on account of the good works which they behold in you.
060	1PE	002	013	Be subject therefore to every human form of government, for the Lord's sake: whether it be to a king as supreme;
060	1PE	002	014	or to governors as persons sent by him for the punishment of evil-doers, and the praise of them that do well.
060	1PE	002	015	For so is the will of God, that by your good behaviour ye may silence the ignorance of foolish men:
060	1PE	002	016	as free, and yet not using your liberty as a cloke for wickedness, but as the servants of God.
060	1PE	002	017	Give due honor to all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.
060	1PE	002	018	Ye who are servants, be subject to your masters with all fear, not only to the good and mild, but also to the morose:
060	1PE	002	019	for this is an evidence of grace, if any one for conscience towards God endure griefs, suffering unjustly.
060	1PE	002	020	For what glory is it, if when ye sin and are punished for it, ye bear it patiently? but if when ye do well and suffer for it, ye bear it patiently, this will gain favor with God.
060	1PE	002	021	For unto this are ye called; because Christ suffered for you, leaving you an example, that ye might follow his steps.
060	1PE	002	022	Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:
060	1PE	002	023	who, when He was reviled, reviled not again; when He suffered, He threatened not; but committed Himself to Him that judgeth righteously.
060	1PE	002	024	Who Himself bare our sins in his own body on the cross, that we being dead to sins, might live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye are healed.
060	1PE	002	025	For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now turned unto the shepherd and bishop of your souls.
060	1PE	003	001	Ye women likewise, be subject to your own husbands, that if any believe not the word, they may yet without the word be gained over by the deportment of the wives,
060	1PE	003	002	beholding your chaste conversation in the fear of God.
060	1PE	003	003	Whose adorning, let it not be that without, of plaiting the hair, and putting on of gold, or wearing fine clothes;
060	1PE	003	004	but the hidden man of the heart, in the incorruptible ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.
060	1PE	003	005	For so also formerly the holy women, who hoped in God, adorned themselves, being submissive to their husbands; as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him her lord:
060	1PE	003	006	whose daughters ye are, if ye do well, and are not terrified with any sinful fear.
060	1PE	003	007	Ye husbands likewise, dwell with them according to knowledge, yielding due respect to the wife as the weaker vessel, and as joint-heirs of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered.
060	1PE	003	008	Finally, my beloved, be unanimous, be sympathizing, love as brethren, be compassionate, be courteous:
060	1PE	003	009	not returning evil for evil, or reproach for reproach: but on the contrary blessing even those that curse you: knowing ye are called unto this, that ye may obtain a blessing.
060	1PE	003	010	"For he that would desire life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile;
060	1PE	003	011	let him turn away from evil, and do good:
060	1PE	003	012	let him seek peace, and pursue it: for the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and his ears are open to their prayer: but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil."
060	1PE	003	013	And who will hurt you, if ye be imitators of Him that is good?
060	1PE	003	014	But if ye should even suffer for righteousness sake, happy are ye: and therefore be not afraid of their menaces, neither be troubled; but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts:
060	1PE	003	015	and be always ready to answer every one that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you, with meekness and reverence:
060	1PE	003	016	having a good conscience, that whereas they speak against you as evil-doers, they may be ashamed who calumniate your good conversation in Christ.
060	1PE	003	017	For it is better (if it be the will of God) to suffer for doing good than for doing evil.
060	1PE	003	018	As Christ also once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust (that He might introduce us to God) being indeed put to death in the flesh, but raised to life by the Spirit:
060	1PE	003	019	by which also He went and preached to the spirits now in prison;
060	1PE	003	020	who of old were disobedient, when the long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was preparing; wherein a few, that is eight souls, were saved by water.
060	1PE	003	021	The resemblance of which, even baptism, doth also now save us, (not the outward cleansing of filth from the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience towards God) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ,
060	1PE	003	022	who is gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God, angels and authorities and powers being made subject to Him.
060	1PE	004	001	Seeing therefore Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same thought, that he, who hath mortified the flesh, hath ceased from sin;
060	1PE	004	002	that he should no longer live the rest of his time in the flesh according to the lusts of men, but after the will of God.
060	1PE	004	003	For the time past of our life is sufficient for us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, walking in lasciviousness, inordinate desires, excess of wine, revellings, drunkenness, and abominable idolatries:
060	1PE	004	004	in which they think it strange that ye run not with them into the same excess of riot, and therefore speak evil of you:
060	1PE	004	005	who shall give an account to Him, who is ready to judge the living and the dead.
060	1PE	004	006	For to this end was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged indeed according to men in the flesh, but might live according to God in the spirit.
060	1PE	004	007	But the end of all things draws nigh: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer:
060	1PE	004	008	having above all things fervent love to each other; for love will cover a multitude of sins.
060	1PE	004	009	Be hospitable one to another, without grudging;
060	1PE	004	010	as every one hath received a gift, imparting it to each other, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.
060	1PE	004	011	If any one speak, let it be as declaring the oracles of God: if any one minister, let it be as from the power which God affordeth him: that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.
060	1PE	004	012	Beloved, be not surprised at the fiery trial coming upon you, which is to try you, as if some strange thing befel you:
060	1PE	004	013	but rejoice in that ye are partakers in the sufferings of Christ; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may also rejoice with exceeding joy.
060	1PE	004	014	If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the Spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: and though as to them He is blasphemed, yet as to you He is glorified.
060	1PE	004	015	But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as a malefactor, or as an intermeddler with other people's affairs.
060	1PE	004	016	But if any suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God herein.
060	1PE	004	017	For the time is coming when judgement is to begin at the house of God: and if at us first, what will be the end of those that obey not the gospel of God?
060	1PE	004	018	And if the righteous be saved with difficulty, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?
060	1PE	004	019	Wherefore let them, that suffer according to the will of God, commit their souls in well-doing to Him as to a faithful Creator.
060	1PE	005	001	The elders that are among you I exhort, who am also an elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and a partaker of the glory which shall be revealed; feed the flock of God that is among you,
060	1PE	005	002	taking the episcopal charge of it, not by constraint, but willingly; not for shameful lucre, but with a ready mind:
060	1PE	005	003	nor as lording it over the people, but being examples to the flock.
060	1PE	005	004	And when the sovereign Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive an unfading crown of glory.
060	1PE	005	005	Likewise ye younger, be subject to the elder; and all of you behaving with due submission one to another, be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, but sheweth favor to the humble.
060	1PE	005	006	Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you in due time;
060	1PE	005	007	casting all your care upon Him, for He careth for you.
060	1PE	005	008	Be sober, be vigilant; for your adversary the devil, like a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:
060	1PE	005	009	whom resist, stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same sufferings are endured by your brethren in the world.
060	1PE	005	010	But may the God of all grace, who hath called us to his eternal glory in Christ Jesus, after ye have suffered a little while, make you perfect, confirm, strengthen, and establish you.
060	1PE	005	011	To Him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.
060	1PE	005	012	Thus I have written briefly by Silvanus, a faithful brother to you (as I judge) exhorting and testifying, that this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand.
060	1PE	005	013	The church in Babylon, chosen together with you saluteth you, and so doth Marcus my son.
060	1PE	005	014	Salute one another with a kiss of charity. Peace be with you all who are in Christ Jesus. Amen.

# BOOK	061	2PE	2 Peter	2 Peter
061	2PE	001	001	Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us, in the righteousness of our God, and of our saviour Jesus Christ:
061	2PE	001	002	grace and peace be multiplied unto you, in the acknowledgement of God, and of Jesus our Lord;
061	2PE	001	003	as his divine power hath given us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of Him who hath called us by that glory and virtue,
061	2PE	001	004	by which are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises; that by these ye may become partakers of a divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.
061	2PE	001	005	And to this giving all diligence, add to your faith fortitude;
061	2PE	001	006	and to fortitude knowledge; and to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience piety;
061	2PE	001	007	and to piety brotherly affection; and to brotherly affection charity.
061	2PE	001	008	For if these be in you and abound, they will not suffer you to be idle, nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
061	2PE	001	009	But he, that hath not these, is blind, or short-sighted, having forgot his baptismal purification from his former sins.
061	2PE	001	010	Wherefore, my brethren, be the more diligent thus to make your calling and election sure; for if ye do these things ye shall never fall.
061	2PE	001	011	For so an entrance shall be administered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
061	2PE	001	012	Wherefore I will not neglect to put you always in mind of these things, though ye know them, and are established in the present truth.
061	2PE	001	013	And I think it my duty, while I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by way of remembrance:
061	2PE	001	014	knowing that I must soon lay down this my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me.
061	2PE	001	015	And I will endeavour that after my departure also ye may always be able to call these things to remembrance.
061	2PE	001	016	For we did not follow artfully devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ; but were eye-witnesses of his majesty.
061	2PE	001	017	For He received from God the Father honor and glory when a voice came to Him from the magnificent glory, saying, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."
061	2PE	001	018	And this voice, from heaven we heard, when we were with Him in the holy mount.
061	2PE	001	019	We have also the more sure word of the prophets, to which ye do well to attend, as to a lamp shining in a dark place, till the day dawn, and the morning-star rise in your hearts:
061	2PE	001	020	knowing this first, that no prophecy of scripture is of private interpretation;
061	2PE	001	021	for prophecy was not delivered of old at the will of man, but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the holy Spirit.
061	2PE	002	001	But there were indeed false prophets among the people of old, as there will be also among you false teachers, who will privately introduce pernicious heresies, denying even the Lord that bought them, and bringing upon themselves swift destruction,
061	2PE	002	002	And many will follow their pernicious tenets, on whose account the way of truth will be reproached:
061	2PE	002	003	and by artful speeches they will make sale of you for gain. Whose judgement is long since hastening, and their destruction doth not slumber.
061	2PE	002	004	For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgement; and if He spared not the old world,
061	2PE	002	005	(but preserved Noah an eighth person, a preacher of righteousness,) bringing a deluge upon the world of the ungodly;
061	2PE	002	006	and reducing the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha to ashes, condemned them to destruction, making them an example to those that should afterwards be impious;
061	2PE	002	007	and delivered righteous Lot grieved at the lewd conversation of the wicked:
061	2PE	002	008	(for that good man by seeing and hearing their crimes, when he dwelt among them, tormented his righteous soul from day to day with their
061	2PE	002	009	iniquitous deeds) then the Lord knoweth how to deliver the pious from temptation, and to reserve the wicked to the day of judgement to be punished:
061	2PE	002	010	especially those who walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise authority; who, being audacious and self-willed, are not afraid to speak evil of dignities:
061	2PE	002	011	whereas angels, who are greater in strength and power, bring not a reviling accusation against them before the Lord.
061	2PE	002	012	But these men, like brute beasts naturally produced to be taken and destroyed, speaking evil of things which they do not understand, shall perish by their own corruption; receiving the reward of their unrighteousness:
061	2PE	002	013	who account it a pleasure to riot even in the day; spots and disgraces; revelling in their frauds, while they partake of your feasts:
061	2PE	002	014	having eyes full of adultery, and which cannot be restrained from sin: ensnaring unstable souls, and having a heart practised in rapine; cursed people:
061	2PE	002	015	who have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, having followed the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of iniquity;
061	2PE	002	016	but was reproved for his transgression: for a dumb beast speaking with the voice of a man checked the madness of the prophet.
061	2PE	002	017	These are wells without water, clouds driven by a storm, for whom thick darkness is reserved for ever.
061	2PE	002	018	For when they speak swelling words of vanity, they ensnare in the lusts of the flesh, through their lasciviousness, those who had indeed withdrawn from such as deal in error;
061	2PE	002	019	promising them liberty, while they themselves are the slaves of corruption: for by whom any one is vanquished, by him he is also enslaved.
061	2PE	002	020	For if, after they had escaped the pollutions of the world, through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled and vanquished by them, their last state is worse than the first;
061	2PE	002	021	for it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than when they knew it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered to them.
061	2PE	002	022	But it is happened to them according to the true proverb, The dog is returned to his own vomit, and, The swine that was washed to her wallowing in the mire.
061	2PE	003	001	This second epistle, my beloved, I now write unto you; in both which I stir up your sincere mind in remembrance,
061	2PE	003	002	that ye may be mindful of the words formerly spoken by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour: knowing this first,
061	2PE	003	003	that there will come in the last days scoffers,
061	2PE	003	004	walking after their own lusts, and saying, Where is the declaration of his coming? for except that the fathers are fallen asleep, all things remain as they were from the beginning of the creation.
061	2PE	003	005	For they are willingly ignorant of this, that by the Word of God the heavens were made of old, and the earth too from the water, and subsisting on the water.
061	2PE	003	006	Whence the old world being drowned in water perished.
061	2PE	003	007	But the heavens and the earth, that now are, by the same Word are kept in store, reserved unto fire on the day of judgement and destruction of ungodly men.
061	2PE	003	008	But, beloved; be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.
061	2PE	003	009	The Lord is not slow as to his promise (as some count it slowness) but is long-suffering towards us, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.
061	2PE	003	010	But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements being set on fire shall be dissolved, and the earth and the works therein shall be burnt up.
061	2PE	003	011	Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in holy conversation and godliness,
061	2PE	003	012	expecting and hastening on the coming of the day of God, whereby the heavens being set on fire shall be dissolved, and the burning elements shall be melted.
061	2PE	003	013	But we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, in which righteousness dwelleth.
061	2PE	003	014	Wherefore, beloved, seeing ye expect these things, give diligence to be found of Him in peace, spotless and blameless;
061	2PE	003	015	and account the long-suffering of our Lord salvation, as our beloved brother Paul also, according to the wisdom given to him, hath written unto you;
061	2PE	003	016	as also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things: in which are some things hard to be understood, which the illiterate and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, to their own destruction.
061	2PE	003	017	Do ye therefore, beloved, as ye know these things before, take heed least being seduced together with them by the error of the wicked, ye should fall from your own stedfastness.
061	2PE	003	018	But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ: to Him be glory both now and for ever. Amen.

# BOOK	062	1JO	1 John	1 John
062	1JO	001	001	That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have contemplated, and our very hands have felt concerning the Word of life,
062	1JO	001	002	(for this Life was manifested, and we saw it; and we testify and declare unto you that eternal Life, which was with the Father,
062	1JO	001	003	and was manifested unto us) what we have seen and heard we declare unto you, that ye also may have communion with us: and our communion is with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ.
062	1JO	001	004	And these things we write unto you, that your joy may be complete.
062	1JO	001	005	Now this we have heard from Him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in Him there is no darkness at all.
062	1JO	001	006	If we say that we have communion with Him, and walk in darkness, we lie and do not practise the truth:
062	1JO	001	007	but if we walk in the light, as He is in the light, we have communion with one another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.
062	1JO	001	008	If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.
062	1JO	001	009	If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness:
062	1JO	001	010	but if we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.
062	1JO	002	001	My little children, I write these things unto you, that ye may not sin. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.
062	1JO	002	002	And He is the propitiation for our sins; and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world.
062	1JO	002	003	And by this we know that we have known Him, if we keep his commandments.
062	1JO	002	004	He that saith, I know Him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.
062	1JO	002	005	But whosoever keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: and by this we know that we are in Him.
062	1JO	002	006	He that saith, he abideth in Him, ought himself also so to walk even as He walked.
062	1JO	002	007	Brethren, I write not a new commandment unto you, but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning: the old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning:
062	1JO	002	008	though I write it again as a new commandment, which is truth in Him and in you: because the darkness is past, and the true light now shineth.
062	1JO	002	009	Now he that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is still in darkness:
062	1JO	002	010	whereas, he that loveth his brother, abideth in the light, and is in no danger of stumbling.
062	1JO	002	011	But he, that hateth his brother, is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not where he goeth, because the darkness hath blinded his eyes.
062	1JO	002	012	I write unto you, little children, because for his sake your sins are forgiven you:
062	1JO	002	013	I write unto you, fathers, because ye have known Him that is from the beginning: and I write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked one. Yea I have written to you, little children, because ye have known the Father:
062	1JO	002	014	I have written unto you, fathers, because ye have known Him that is from the beginning: and I have written to you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one---
062	1JO	002	015	Love not the world, nor the things that are in the world; for if any one love the world to excess, the love of the Father is not in him.
062	1JO	002	016	For all that is in the world, the desire of the flesh, and the desire of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but of the world.
062	1JO	002	017	And the world passeth away, and the desire of it: but he, that doth the will of God, abideth for ever.
062	1JO	002	018	Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that an antichrist will come, there are even now many antichrists, whereby we know that it is the last time.
062	1JO	002	019	They went out from us, but they were not of us: for if they had been indeed of us, they would have continued with us; but this was done that they might be made manifest, because all, that are with us, are not indeed of us.
062	1JO	002	020	And ye have an unction from the holy One, and know all.
062	1JO	002	021	I have not therefore written to you, because ye know not the truth; but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth.
062	1JO	002	022	Who is a liar, if not he who denieth that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist, that denieth the Father as well as the Son;
062	1JO	002	023	for whosoever denieth the Son, hath not the Father: but he that confesseth the Son acknowledgeth the Father also.
062	1JO	002	024	Let that therefore, which ye have heard from the beginning, abide in you: for if that, which ye heard from the beginning, remain in you, ye also will remain in the Son and in the Father.
062	1JO	002	025	And this is the promise which He hath promised us, even eternal life.
062	1JO	002	026	These things have I written unto you concerning those who would seduce you.
062	1JO	002	027	But the unction, which ye have received from Him, abideth in you; and therefore ye have no need that any should teach you: since this very unction teacheth you concerning all things, and is truth and not falshood; even as that hath taught you, abide in Him.
062	1JO	002	028	And now, little children, abide, I say, in Him; that, when He shall appear, we may have confidence, and may not be ashamed before Him at his coming.
062	1JO	002	029	If ye know that He is righteous, ye know that every one, who practiseth righteousness, is born of Him.
062	1JO	003	001	Behold then what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the children of God: though for this reason the world knoweth us not, because it knew not Him.
062	1JO	003	002	Beloved, we are now the children of God, but it doth not yet appear what we shall be: we know however, that, when He shall appear, we shall be like Him; for we shall see Him as He is.
062	1JO	003	003	And every one, that hath this hope in Him, purifieth himself, even as He is pure.
062	1JO	003	004	Every one that committeth sin, transgresseth the law; for sin is the violation of the law.
062	1JO	003	005	And ye know that He was manifested, to take away our sins: and in Him there is no sin.
062	1JO	003	006	Whosoever abideth in Him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen Him, nor known Him.
062	1JO	003	007	Little children, let no one deceive you: he that practiseth righteousness is righteous, even as He is righteous:
062	1JO	003	008	he, that makes a practise of sin, is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. And for this the Son of God was manifested, that He might destroy the works of the devil.
062	1JO	003	009	Whosoever is born of God doth not practise sin, because his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.
062	1JO	003	010	In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doth not practise righteousness, and he who loveth not his brother, is not of God:
062	1JO	003	011	for this is the injunction which ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another: not as Cain who was of the evil one, and slew his brother;
062	1JO	003	012	and why did he slay him? because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous.
062	1JO	003	013	Wonder not then, my brethren, if the world hate you:
062	1JO	003	014	since we know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren: he, that loveth not his brother, remaineth in death.
062	1JO	003	015	Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.
062	1JO	003	016	In this we know his love, that He laid down his life for us: and we should be ready to lay down our lives for the brethren.
062	1JO	003	017	But if any one, who hath the good things of the world, seeth his brother in want, and shutteth up his bowels from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?
062	1JO	003	018	My little children, let us not love in word, or in tongue only, but in deed and in truth.
062	1JO	003	019	And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before Him.
062	1JO	003	020	For, if our heart condemn us, God is still greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.
062	1JO	003	021	Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence towards God:
062	1JO	003	022	and whatsoever we ask, we receive from Him, because we keep his commandments, and do the things that are pleasing in his sight.
062	1JO	003	023	And this is his commandment, that we should believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as He hath given us a charge to do.
062	1JO	003	024	And he, that keepeth his commandments, abideth in Him, and He in him: and hereby we know that He abideth in us, even by the Spirit which He hath given us.
062	1JO	004	001	Beloved, believe not every Spirit, but try the spirits, whether they be of God: for many false prophets are gone out into the world.
062	1JO	004	002	By this ye may know the Spirit of God: every Spirit that confesseth Jesus Christ, who is come in the flesh, is of God:
062	1JO	004	003	and every spirit that doth not confess Jesus Christ, who is come in the flesh, is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, which ye have heard was coming, and is already in the world.
062	1JO	004	004	Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them; because greater is He, that is in you, than he that is in the world.
062	1JO	004	005	They are of the world; therefore they speak as men of the world, and the world heareth them.
062	1JO	004	006	We are of God: he, that knoweth God, heareth us; but he, who is not of God, heareth not us. By this we know the Spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.
062	1JO	004	007	Beloved, let us love one another: for love is from God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.
062	1JO	004	008	He, that loveth not, knoweth not God: for God is love.
062	1JO	004	009	In this was the love of God manifested towards us, that God sent his only-begotten Son into the world, that we might live through Him.
062	1JO	004	010	Herein is love; not that we loved God, but that He loved us, and sent his Son to be a propitiation for our sins.
062	1JO	004	011	Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.
062	1JO	004	012	No one hath ever seen God: but if we love one another, God dwelleth in us and his love is perfected in us.
062	1JO	004	013	By this we know that we are in Him, and He in us; because He hath given us of his Spirit.
062	1JO	004	014	And we have seen, and do testify, that the Father hath sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world.
062	1JO	004	015	Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God.
062	1JO	004	016	And we have known and believed the love which God hath towards us: for God is love; and he, that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God, and God in him.
062	1JO	004	017	Herein is love perfected with us, that we may have boldness in the day of judgement; for as He is, we also are in this world.
062	1JO	004	018	There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear; because fear hath torment; but he that feareth is not perfected in love.
062	1JO	004	019	We love Him, because He first loved us. If any one say,
062	1JO	004	020	I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for how can he, that loveth not his brother, whom he hath seen, love God whom he hath not seen?
062	1JO	004	021	And we have this commandment from Him, that he, who loveth God, should love his brother also.
062	1JO	005	001	Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and every one, that loveth Him that begat, loveth Him also that is begotten of Him:
062	1JO	005	002	and in this we know that we love the children of God, since we love God and keep his commandments.
062	1JO	005	003	For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous.
062	1JO	005	004	For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that vanquisheth the world, even our faith.
062	1JO	005	005	Who then is he that overcometh the world, but he who believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?
062	1JO	005	006	This is He that came by water and by blood, even Jesus the Messiah; not with water only, but with water and blood: and of this the Spirit beareth witness, for the Spirit is truth.
062	1JO	005	007	Yea there are three that bear witness, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood:
062	1JO	005	008	and these three agree in one.
062	1JO	005	009	Now if we admit the testimony of men, sure the testimony of God is greater: and this is the testimony of God, which He hath testified concerning his Son.
062	1JO	005	010	He, that believeth on the Son of God, hath the witness in himself: he, that believeth not God, hath in effect made Him a liar, because he believed not the testimony which God hath testified of his Son.
062	1JO	005	011	And the testimony is this, that God hath given to us eternal life; and this life is in his Son.
062	1JO	005	012	He that hath the Son hath life: he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.
062	1JO	005	013	These things have I written to you, who believe on the name of the son of God, that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may the more firmly believe on the name of the Son of God.
062	1JO	005	014	And this is the confidence, which we have towards Him, that if we ask any thing according to his will, He heareth us:
062	1JO	005	015	and if we know that He heareth us in whatsoever we ask; we know that we shall have the petitions, which we have requested of Him.
062	1JO	005	016	If any one see his brother commit a sin which is not unto death, let him pray for him, and God will give him life, that is for them that do not sin unto death. There is a sin unto death: and for that I do not say that he should pray.
062	1JO	005	017	All unrighteousness indeed is sin, and yet there is a sin not unto death.
062	1JO	005	018	We know that whosoever is born of God, doth not practise sin: but keepeth himself from it, and the wicked one doth not touch him.
062	1JO	005	019	We know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth under the wicked one.
062	1JO	005	020	But we know that the son of God is come, and hath given us understanding, that we may know Him that is true, and we are in Him that is true, and in his son Jesus Christ: He is the true God, and eternal life.
062	1JO	005	021	Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen.

063	2JO	001	001	The elder unto the excellent Lady, and her children, whom I love in truth: and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth;
063	2JO	001	002	for the sake of the truth which dwelleth in us, and will be with us for ever:
063	2JO	001	003	grace, mercy, and peace be with you from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.
063	2JO	001	004	I rejoiced greatly that I found among thy children such as walked in truth, as we received commandment from the Father.
063	2JO	001	005	And now I beseech thee, Lady, not as writing to thee a new commandment, but that which we had from the beginning, that we may love one another.
063	2JO	001	006	And this is love, that we walk according to his commandments. This is the commandment, as ye heard from the beginning, that ye should walk in it.
063	2JO	001	007	For many deceivers are come out into the world, who disown that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. Such a one is a deceiver and an antichrist.
063	2JO	001	008	Look to yourselves, that ye lose not the things which ye have wrought, but that ye may receive a full reward.
063	2JO	001	009	Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God: but he, that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, hath both the Father and the Son.
063	2JO	001	010	Now if any one come unto you, and bringeth not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, nor wish him success: for he,
063	2JO	001	011	that biddeth him welcome, is partaker of his evil deeds.
063	2JO	001	012	Having many things to write unto you, I would not with paper and ink: but I hope to come unto you, and speak mouth to mouth, that our joy may be full.

064	3JO	001	002	Beloved, I earnestly pray, that thou mayst prosper and be in health, as thy soul prospereth.
064	3JO	001	003	For I greatly rejoiced, when the brethren came, and bore testimony to thy truth, even as thou walkest in truth.
064	3JO	001	004	And I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in the truth.
064	3JO	001	005	Beloved, thou actest faithfully in whatsoever service thou dost to the brethren, and to strangers too;
064	3JO	001	006	who have borne witness to thy love before the church: whom thou wilt do well in forwarding, as is worthy of God.
064	3JO	001	007	For they went forth for his name's sake, taking nothing of the gentiles.
064	3JO	001	008	We ought therefore to receive such, that we may become fellow-laborers in the truth.
064	3JO	001	009	I wrote to the church: but Diotrephes, who affects the pre-eminence among them, doth not receive us.
064	3JO	001	010	Therefore when I come, I will remember his deeds, prating against us with wicked words: and not content with these, he neither receiveth the brethren himself, nor suffers those that would; and casteth them out of the church.
064	3JO	001	011	Beloved, do not thou follow that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doth good is of God: but he, that doth evil, hath not seen God.
064	3JO	001	012	A good testimony is borne to Demetrius by all men, and by the truth itself: yea, and we also bear him like witness, and ye know that our testimony is true.
064	3JO	001	013	I had many things to write: but I would not write to thee with pen and ink;
064	3JO	001	014	for I hope to see thee soon, and we shall speak mouth to mouth. Peace be to thee. Our friends salute thee. Salute the friends by name.

065	JUD	001	001	Jude a servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to them that are sanctified in God the Father, and who are preserved and called in Jesus Christ;
065	JUD	001	002	mercy, and peace, and love be multiplied unto you.
065	JUD	001	003	Beloved, having an earnest desire to write to you concerning the common salvation, I was under a necessity of writing to exhort you that ye would strive earnestly for the faith which was once delivered to the saints.
065	JUD	001	004	For there have crept in some men, who have been of old described as under this condemnation, impious people, that turn the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and deny God the only Lord, and our Lord Jesus Christ.
065	JUD	001	005	But I would remind you of this, which ye know already, that though the Lord saved the people out of the land of Egypt, yet He afterwards destroyed those that believed not:
065	JUD	001	006	and the angels that kept not their primitive state, but left their proper abode, hath He reserved in everlasting chains, under darkness, to the judgement of the great day:
065	JUD	001	007	as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them, in like manner with them committing lewdness, and going after strange flesh, are set forth as an example, suffering the vengeance of perpetual fire.
065	JUD	001	008	So these vile dreamers also defile the flesh, despise authority, and speak evil of dignities.
065	JUD	001	009	Whereas Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses, did not presume to bring against him a railing accusation, but said, "The Lord rebuke thee."
065	JUD	001	010	But these men speak evil of what they know not: and what they know naturally, as brute animals, in these things they are corrupt.
065	JUD	001	011	Wo unto them; for they have gone in the way of Cain, and been carried away by Balaam's error, the love of lucre, and perished as in the contradiction of Korah.
065	JUD	001	012	These are spots in your love-feasts, feeding themselves without fear, when they are feasting with you: clouds without water, carried about by the winds; trees withered and without fruit, twice dead and rooted up; raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame;
065	JUD	001	013	wandering stars, for whom blackness of darkness is reserved for ever.
065	JUD	001	014	And Enoch the seventh from Adam prophesied against these, saying, Behold the Lord cometh with his holy myriads,
065	JUD	001	015	to pass judgement upon all, and to convict all the ungodly among them of all their wicked works, which they have impiously committed, and of all the hard things which impious sinners have spoken against Him.
065	JUD	001	016	These are murmurers, complainers, who walk according to their own irregular desires; and their mouth speaketh great swelling words, with admiration of certain persons for some advantage of their own.
065	JUD	001	017	But, beloved, remember the words which were formerly spoken by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ; for they told you,
065	JUD	001	018	that in the latter days there will be scoffers, walking according to their own impious lusts.
065	JUD	001	019	These are they who separate themselves, sensualists, not having the Spirit.
065	JUD	001	020	But ye, beloved, edifying yourselves in your most holy faith, and praying in the holy Spirit, keep yourselves in the love of God,
065	JUD	001	021	looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.
065	JUD	001	022	And on some have compassion, making a difference; others save with fear,
065	JUD	001	023	as snatching them out of the fire: hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.
065	JUD	001	024	Now unto Him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you blameless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy:
065	JUD	001	025	to the only wise God our Saviour be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and for ever. Amen.

066	REV	001	005	and from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, the first-born from the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To Him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood,

066	REV	001	009	I John, who am also your brother, and companion in the affliction, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the island called Patmos, for the sake of the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.
066	REV	001	010	Here I was in the Spirit on the Lord's-day: and heard behind me a loud voice, as of a trumpet,
066	REV	001	011	saying, I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last; and, What thou seest write in a book, and send it to the seven churches in Asia, to Ephesus, and to Smyrna, and to Pergamos, and to Thyatira, and to Sardis, and to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.
066	REV	001	012	And I turned to see the voice that spake to me: and when I turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks;
066	REV	001	013	and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like the Son of man, clothed with a long robe, and girded about the breasts with a golden girdle.
066	REV	001	014	His head and his hairs were white like white wool, as white as snow; and his eyes as a flame of fire;
066	REV	001	015	and his feet like fine brass, as if they were glowing in a furnace: and his voice as the sound of many waters:
066	REV	001	016	and He had in his right hand seven stars, and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword: and his countenance was as the sun when he shineth in his strength.
066	REV	001	017	And when I saw Him, I fell at his feet as dead; and He laid his right hand upon me, and said to me, "Fear not,
066	REV	001	018	I am the first and the last, who live, though I was dead; and behold, I am alive for ever and ever, Amen, and have the keys of hades and of death.
066	REV	001	019	Write what thou hast seen, the things which are, and which are to be hereafter."
066	REV	001	020	As to the mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks; the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches.
066	REV	002	001	To the angel of the church at Ephesus write, These things saith He that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks;
066	REV	002	002	I know thy works, and thy labor, and thy patience, and that thou canst not bear those that are evil: and thou hast tried those who say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars; and hast borne trouble, and hast patience;
066	REV	002	003	and for my name's sake thou hast laboured, and hast not fainted.
066	REV	002	004	Yet I have somewhat against thee; for thou hast left thy first love.
066	REV	002	005	Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works: else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of its place, if thou repent not.
066	REV	002	006	But this thou hast, that thou hatest the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.
066	REV	002	007	Let him, that hath an ear, hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches. To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.
066	REV	002	008	And to the angel of the church in Smyrna write, These things saith the First and the Last, who was dead and is alive;
066	REV	002	009	I know thy works and affliction and poverty (but thou art rich) and I know the blasphemy of those that say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.
066	REV	002	010	Fear none of the things which thou wilt suffer: behold the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall suffer affliction ten days. Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.
066	REV	002	011	Let him, that hath an ear, hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches. He, that overcometh, shall not be hurt by the second death.
066	REV	002	012	And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write, These things saith He, who hath the sharp two-edged sword;
066	REV	002	013	I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, even where Satan's seat is: and yet thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr; who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth.
066	REV	002	014	But I have a few things against thee; for thou hast there those that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balak to cast a stumbling-block before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit fornication.
066	REV	002	015	So thou hast also them that hold the like doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which I hate.
066	REV	002	016	Repent therefore---if not, I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight against them with the sword that goeth out of my mouth.
066	REV	002	017	Let him, that hath an ear, hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches. To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna: and I will give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name written, which no one knoweth, but He that receiveth it.
066	REV	002	018	And to the angel of the church in Thyatira write, These things saith the Son of God, who hath eyes like a flame of fire, and his feet like fine brass; I know thy works,
066	REV	002	019	and thy love, and thy service, and thy faith, and thy patience, and that thy last works are more than the first.
066	REV	002	020	But I have a few things against thee; because thou sufferest the woman Jezabel, who saith that she is a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication and to eat things sacrificed to idols.
066	REV	002	021	And I gave her time to repent of her fornication, and she repented not.
066	REV	002	022	Behold I will cast her into a bed, and those that commit whoredom with her, into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds:
066	REV	002	023	and I will cut off her children by death; and all the churches shall know, that I am He who searcheth the reins and hearts, and I will give unto every one of you according to your works.
066	REV	002	024	But to you I say, to the rest in Thyatira, As many as do not hold this doctrine, and who are unacquainted with the depths of Satan, as they speak, I will lay on you no other burden:
066	REV	002	025	but what ye have hold fast till I come.
066	REV	002	026	And to him that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, will I give power over the nations:
066	REV	002	027	and he shall rule them with a rod of iron, as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken in pieces; as I also have received of my Father;
066	REV	002	028	and I will give him the morning-star.
066	REV	002	029	Let him, that hath an ear, hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.
066	REV	003	001	And to the angel of the church in Sardis write, These things saith He that hath the seven spirits of God, and the seven stars; I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead:
066	REV	003	002	be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die; for I have not found thy works perfect in the sight of God.
066	REV	003	003	Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and hold fast, and repent: for if thou be not watchful, I will come upon thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know at what hour I will come upon thee.
066	REV	003	004	Thou hast a few names even in Sardis, which have not defiled their garments, and they shall walk with me in white; for they are worthy.
066	REV	003	005	He that overcometh shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name from the book of life; but I will own his name before my Father, and before his angels.

066	REV	003	007	And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write, These things saith the holy One, He that is true, He that hath the key of David, He that openeth and no one shutteth, and shutteth and no one openeth:
066	REV	003	008	I know thy works, and behold I have given thee an open door, and no one shall be able to shut it; for thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name.
066	REV	003	009	Behold, I will give up those of the synagogue of Satan, who say they are Jews, and are not, but speak falsely; behold, I will make them come and bow before thy feet, and they shall know that I have loved thee.
066	REV	003	010	Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which is to come upon the whole world, to try those that dwell upon the earth.
066	REV	003	011	Behold, I come quickly; hold fast what thou hast, that no one may take thy crown.
066	REV	003	012	Him, that overcometh, I will make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go out no more: and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, (the new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God,) and my own new name.
066	REV	003	013	Let him, that hath an ear, hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.
066	REV	003	014	And to the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write, These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God; I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot:
066	REV	003	015	I wish thou wert cold or hot.
066	REV	003	016	So then, because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will cast thee out of my mouth:
066	REV	003	017	because thou sayst, I am rich, and wealthy, and have want of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked.
066	REV	003	018	I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayst be rich; and white raiment that thou mayst be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness may not appear: and anoint thine eyes with eye-salve, that thou mayst see.
066	REV	003	019	Whomsoever I love, I reprove and chasten: be zealous therefore and repent.
066	REV	003	020	Behold, I stand at the door and knock: if any one hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.
066	REV	003	021	To him that overcometh I will grant to sit with me on my throne, as I also have overcome, and am set down with my Father on his throne.
066	REV	003	022	Let him, that hath an ear, hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.
066	REV	004	001	After these things I saw, and behold, a door opened in heaven; and the first voice which I heard was as of a trumpet speaking to me; and it said, Come up hither, and I will shew thee things which must come to pass hereafter.
066	REV	004	002	And immmediately I was in the Spirit: and behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one sitting on the throne.
066	REV	004	003	And He that sat upon it, was to look at like a jasper and a sardine stone, and there was a rainbow round the throne like the appearance of an emerald.
066	REV	004	004	And around the throne were four and twenty seats: and upon the seats I saw twenty four elders sitting, clothed in white garments; and they had upon their heads crowns of gold.
066	REV	004	005	And out of the throne came lightnings, and thunders, and voices: and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne; which are the seven spirits of God.
066	REV	004	006	And before the throne was a sea of glass, like crystal: and in the middle of the throne, and the circle of it, were four animate beings full of eyes before and behind.
066	REV	004	007	And the first was like a lion, and the second like a calf, and the third had a face like a man, and the fourth was like a flying eagle.
066	REV	004	008	And the four animals had each of them six wings round about, and within were full of eyes; and they cease not day and night saying, Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God almighty, who was, and who is, and who is to come.
066	REV	004	009	And when the animals give glory and honor and thanks to Him that sitteth on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever,
066	REV	004	010	the four and twenty elders fall down before Him that sitteth on the throne, and worship Him that liveth for ever and ever,
066	REV	004	011	and cast their crowns before the throne, saying, Worthy art thou, O Lord, to receive glory and honor and power; for thou hast created all things, and by thy will they exist, and were created.
066	REV	005	001	And I saw on the right hand of Him that sat on the throne a book written within and without, sealed with seven seals:
066	REV	005	002	and I saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals of it?
066	REV	005	003	And no one in heaven, nor on earth, nor under the earth, was able to open the book, or to look into it:
066	REV	005	004	and I wept much because no one was found worthy to open and read the book, nor to look into it.
066	REV	005	005	And one of the elders said to me, Weep not; ---Behold the lion of the tribe of Juda, the root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose its seven seals.
066	REV	005	006	And I beheld, and lo, in the midst of the throne, and of the four animals, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb, as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth.
066	REV	005	007	And He came and took the book out of the right hand of Him that sat upon the throne.
066	REV	005	008	And when He had taken the book, the four animals, and the twenty four elders, fell down before the Lamb, having every one harps and golden vials full of perfumes, which are the prayers of the saints.
066	REV	005	009	And they sung a new song, saying, Worthy art thou to take the book, and to open its seals; for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood, out of every tribe, and tongue, and people, and nation;
066	REV	005	010	and hast made us to our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth.
066	REV	005	011	And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round the throne and the animals and the elders: and the number of them was myriads of myriads, and thousands of thousands;
066	REV	005	012	saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain, to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honor, and glory, and blessing.
066	REV	005	013	And I heard every creature in heaven, and on earth, and under the earth, and on the sea, and all that are in them, saying, Blessing, and honor, and glory, and power be unto Him that sitteth upon the throne, and to the Lamb, for ever and ever.
066	REV	005	014	And the four animals said, Amen: and the twenty four elders fell down and worshipped Him that liveth to endless ages.
066	REV	006	001	And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard one of the four animate beings saying, as with a voice of thunder, Come and see.
066	REV	006	002	And I saw, and behold a white horse; and He that sat upon it had a bow, and a crown was given Him, and He went forth conquering and to conquer.
066	REV	006	003	And when He opened the second seal, I heard the second animal saying, Come and see.
066	REV	006	004	And there came out another horse, which was red: and it was given to him, that sat upon it, to take peace from the earth, that they should kill one another: and there was given him a great sword.
066	REV	006	005	And when He opened the third seal, I heard the third animal say, Come and see. And I beheld, and lo, a black horse, and he that sat upon it had a balance in his hand.
066	REV	006	006	And I heard a voice in the midst of the four animals saying, One measure of wheat for a denary, and but three measures of barley for a denary: but see that thou hurt not the oil and the wine.
066	REV	006	007	And when He opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth animal saying, Come and see.
066	REV	006	008	And I saw, and behold a pale horse, and the name of him that sat upon it was Death, and Hades followed him: and power was given them to slay a fourth part of the earth, by sword, and by famine, and by pestilence, and by wild beasts.
066	REV	006	009	And when He opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those that had been slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they maintained.
066	REV	006	010	And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on those that dwell upon the earth?
066	REV	006	011	And white robes were given to each of them, and it was told them to rest a little while longer, till the number of their fellow-servants, and their brethren that should be killed as they were, should be complete.
066	REV	006	012	And I saw when He opened the sixth seal, and behold there was a great earthquake, and the sun became black as sack-cloth of hair, and the moon was red as blood;
066	REV	006	013	and the stars of heaven fell to the earth, as a fig-tree droppeth it's unripe figs, when shaken by a strong wind;
066	REV	006	014	and the heaven passed away as a book rolled up, and every mountain and island were moved out of their places:
066	REV	006	015	and the kings of the earth, and the grandees, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every slave, and every free man, hid themselves in the caverns and in the rocks of the mountains;
066	REV	006	016	and said to the mountains and to the rocks, "Fall upon us, and hide us from the face of Him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb:
066	REV	006	017	for the great day of his wrath is come, and who can stand before Him?"
066	REV	007	001	And after these things, I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind might not blow upon the earth, nor upon the sea, nor upon any tree.
066	REV	007	002	And I saw another angel which ascended from the east, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea,
066	REV	007	003	saying, Hurt not the earth, nor the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads.
066	REV	007	004	And I heard the number of those that were sealed; and there were an hundred forty and four thousand sealed out of all the tribes of the children of Israel.
066	REV	007	005	Of the tribe of Judah were sealed twelve thousand: of the tribe of Reuben were sealed twelve thousand: of the tribe of Gad were sealed twelve thousand:
066	REV	007	006	of the tribe of Aser were sealed twelve thousand: of the tribe of Nephthalim were sealed twelve thousand: of the tribe of Manasseh were sealed twelve thousand:
066	REV	007	007	of the tribe of Simeon were sealed twelve thousand: of the tribe of Levi were sealed twelve thousand: of the tribe of Issachar were sealed twelve thousand:
066	REV	007	008	of the tribe of Zabulon were sealed twelve thousand: of the tribe of Joseph were sealed twelve thousand: of the tribe of Benjamin were sealed twelve thousand.
066	REV	007	009	After this I beheld, and lo, a great multitude, which no one could number, out of all nations, and tribes, and people, and languages, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes, and with palms in their hands;
066	REV	007	010	and crying with a loud voice, saying, Salvation be ascribed to our God, who sitteth upon the throne, and to the Lamb.
066	REV	007	011	And all the angels stood round the throne, and round the elders, and the four animate beings; and fell on their faces before the throne, and worshipped God, saying, Amen:
066	REV	007	012	Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honor, and power, and strength be ascribed to our God for ever and ever. Amen.
066	REV	007	013	And one of the elders said unto me, Who are these that are clothed in white robes, and from whence did they come?
066	REV	007	014	And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are they who come out of great affliction, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.
066	REV	007	015	Therefore they are before the throne of God, and serve Him day and night in his temple: and He that sitteth upon the throne shall dwell among them.
066	REV	007	016	They shall hunger no more, nor thirst any more, nor shall the sun nor any violent heat fall upon them.
066	REV	007	017	For the Lamb, that is in the midst of the throne, shall feed them, and shall lead them to fountains of living waters: and God will wipe off every tear from their eyes.
066	REV	008	001	And when He opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour:
066	REV	008	002	and I saw the seven angels, that stood before God; and seven trumpets were given to them.
066	REV	008	003	And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given to Him much incense, that He might present it with the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar, which was before the throne.
066	REV	008	004	And the smoke of the incense went up with the prayers of the saints, out of the hand of the angel, before God.
066	REV	008	005	And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the altar, and cast it upon the earth: and there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings, and an earthquake.
066	REV	008	006	And the seven angels, that had the seven trumpets, prepared themselves to sound their trumpets.
066	REV	008	007	And the first angel sounded his trumpet, and there was hail and fire mingled with blood, and it was cast down upon the earth: and a third part of the trees and every green herb was burnt up.
066	REV	008	008	And the second angel sounded, and I saw as it were a great mountain on fire cast into the sea, and a third part of the sea became blood.
066	REV	008	009	And a third part of the creatures in the sea, that had life, died; and a third part of the ships were destroyed.
066	REV	008	010	And the third angel sounded, and there fell from heaven a great star burning like a torch, and it fell upon a third part of the rivers, and the fountains of waters: and the name of the star is Wormwood;
066	REV	008	011	and a third part of the waters became as wormwood: and many men died of the waters, because they were bitter.
066	REV	008	012	And the fourth angel sounded, and a third part of the sun was smitten, and a third part of the moon, and a third part of the stars; so that the third part of them was darkened, and the day lost a third part of it's light, and the night likewise.
066	REV	008	013	And I beheld, and heard an angel flying in the midst of heaven saying with a loud voice, Wo, wo, wo to the inhabitants on the earth from the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels, that are yet to sound.
066	REV	009	001	And the fifth angel sounded his trumpet, and I saw a star fall from heaven to the earth: and the key of the bottomless pit was given to him.
066	REV	009	002	And he opened the bottomless pit: and there came up smoke out of the pit as the smoke of a great furnace, and the sun and the air were darkened by the smoke of the pit.
066	REV	009	003	And out of the smoke there came forth locusts upon the earth; and power was given them, even as the scorpions of the earth have power.
066	REV	009	004	And order was given them, not to hurt the grass of the earth, nor any green thing, nor any tree; but only the men, who had not the seal of God on their foreheads.
066	REV	009	005	And to them was given power, not to kill them, but that they should be tormented five months: and their torment was like the torment of a scorpion when it striketh a man.
066	REV	009	006	And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it: and they shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them.
066	REV	009	007	And the resemblance of the locusts was like horses prepared for war; and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold, and their faces as the faces of men.
066	REV	009	008	And they had hair like the hair of women, and their teeth were as the teeth of lions.
066	REV	009	009	And they had breast-plates like breast-plates of iron; and the sound of their wings was like the sound of chariots, with many horses running to battle.
066	REV	009	010	And they had tails like scorpions, and there were stings in their tails: and their power was to hurt men five months.
066	REV	009	011	And they had a king over them, the angel of the bottomless pit; whose name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in the Greek tongue Apollyon.
066	REV	009	012	Thus one wo is past, but behold two woes more are coming after.
066	REV	009	013	And the sixth angel sounded his trumpet, and I heard a certain voice from the four horns of the golden altar, which is before God,
066	REV	009	014	saying to the sixth angel, who had the trumpet, Let loose the four angels, that are bound by the great river Euphrates.
066	REV	009	015	And the four angels were let loose; who were prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year, to kill the third part of men.
066	REV	009	016	And the number of their armies was two hundred millions: for I heard the number of them.
066	REV	009	017	And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and those that sat on them, that is, having breast-plates of fire, and of jacinth, and brimstone: and the heads of the horses were like the heads of lions, and out of their mouths came fire, and smoke, and brimstone.
066	REV	009	018	And by these three things, by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the brimstone, which came out of their mouths, the third part of men were killed.
066	REV	009	019	For their power is in their mouth, and in their tails also; for their tails are like serpents, having heads: and with these likewise they do mischief.
066	REV	009	020	And the rest of the men, who were not killed by these plagues, yet repented not of the works of their hands, so as not to worship demons, and idols of gold, and of silver, and of brass, and of stone, and of wood; which can neither see, nor hear, nor walk:
066	REV	009	021	neither did they repent of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their whoredom, nor of their thefts.
066	REV	010	001	And I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven invested with a cloud: and there was a rainbow on his head, and his face was as the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire.
066	REV	010	002	And he had in his hand a little book open: and he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left upon the earth.
066	REV	010	003	And he cried with a loud voice like the roaring of a lion; and when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices.
066	REV	010	004	And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was going to write: but I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Seal up what the seven thunders spake, and write them not.
066	REV	010	005	And the angel which I saw standing on the sea and on the earth,
066	REV	010	006	lifted up his hand to heaven, and sware by Him that liveth for ever, who created the heaven and the things therein, and the earth and the things that are in it, and the sea and the things therein, that there shall be time no longer:
066	REV	010	007	but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall sound his trumpet, the mystery of God shall be finished, as He hath declared to his servants the prophets.
066	REV	010	008	And the voice, which I heard from heaven, spake to me again, and said, Go, take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel that standeth upon the sea and upon the earth.
066	REV	010	009	And I went to the angel, and said to him, Give me the little book. And he said to me, Take it, and eat it up: and it shall make thy belly bitter, but in thy mouth it will be sweet as honey.
066	REV	010	010	And I took the little book out of the angel's hand, and ate it up: and it was in my mouth sweet as honey, and when I had eaten it my belly was bitter.
066	REV	010	011	And he said unto me, Thou must prophesy again of many people and nations and tongues and kings.
066	REV	011	001	And there was given me a reed like a measuring rod; and the angel stood and said, Rise and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and the extent of those that worship at it.
066	REV	011	002	But leave the outer court of the temple, and measure it not, for it is given to the gentiles: and they shall trample on the holy city forty two months.
066	REV	011	003	And I will give power to my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and sixty days, clothed in sackcloth.
066	REV	011	004	These are the two olive-trees, and two candlesticks that stand before the God of the earth.
066	REV	011	005	And if any one seek to injure them, fire cometh out of their mouth, and devoureth their enemies: yea, if any one shall desire to injure them, thus shall he be slain.
066	REV	011	006	These have power to shut the heavens, so that no rain may fall in the days of their prophecy: and they have power over the waters to turn them into blood, and to smite the earth with every plague as often as they will.
066	REV	011	007	And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that ascendeth out of the abyss, will make war against them, and overcome them, and kill them.
066	REV	011	008	And their dead bodies shall fall in the street of the great city, which is spiritually called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified.
066	REV	011	009	And various people, and tribes, and tongues, and nations, shall see their dead bodies three days and an half, and not suffer their corpses to be buried.
066	REV	011	010	And those that dwell upon the earth shall triumph over them, and be merry, and send presents to one another: because these two prophets had tormented those that dwelt on the earth.
066	REV	011	011	But after three days and an half the spirit of life from God entered into them: and they stood upon their feet, and great fear fell upon those that saw them.
066	REV	011	012	And they heard a great voice from heaven, saying to them, Come up hither; and they ascended up to heaven in a cloud, and their enemies beheld them.
066	REV	011	013	And at that time there was a great earthquake, and a tenth part of the city fell, and in the earthquake were killed seven thousand men: and the rest were terrified, and gave glory to the God of heaven.
066	REV	011	014	The second wo is past, and behold the third wo is coming quickly.
066	REV	011	015	And the seventh angel sounded his trumpet, and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of the world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Anointed, and He shall reign for ever and ever.
066	REV	011	016	And the four and twenty elders, who sat before God on their thrones, fell on their faces, and worshipped God,
066	REV	011	017	saying, We give thanks unto thee, O Lord God almighty, who art, and who wast, and who art to come; because thou hast assumed thy great power, and hast reigned.
066	REV	011	018	The nations were enraged, but thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and to give a reward to thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and to those that fear thy name, small and great; and to destroy them that destroy the earth.
066	REV	011	019	And the temple of God in heaven was opened, and the ark of his covenant was seen in his temple: and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunderings, and an earthquake, and great hail.
066	REV	012	001	And there appeared a great sign in heaven, a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars.
066	REV	012	002	And being with child, she cried out in travail, labouring to be delivered.
066	REV	012	003	And there appeared another sign in heaven, and behold, a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns; and upon his heads seven crowns.
066	REV	012	004	And his tail drew a third part of the stars of heaven, and cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman, who was ready to bring forth, that when she was delivered, he might devour her child.
066	REV	012	005	And she brought forth a male child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and to his throne.
066	REV	012	006	And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that they might nourish her there a thousand two hundred and sixty days.
066	REV	012	007	And there was war in heaven, Michael and his angels fought against the dragon: and the dragon fought, and his angels;
066	REV	012	008	but these prevailed not, neither was their place found any more in heaven.
066	REV	012	009	And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the devil and Satan, who deceiveth the whole world: he was cast down to the earth, and his angels were cast down with him.
066	REV	012	010	And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come the salvation, and the power, and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, who accused them before our God day and night.
066	REV	012	011	And they have overcome him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony, and they loved not their life unto the death.
066	REV	012	012	Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them: but wo to the inhabitants of the earth and of the sea; for the devil is come down to you, in great rage, knowing that he hath but a short time.
066	REV	012	013	Now when the dragon saw that he was cast down to the earth, he persecuted the woman that brought forth the male-child:
066	REV	012	014	and there were given to the woman two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness to her place, where she is to be nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.
066	REV	012	015	And the serpent threw water out of his mouth, like a river, after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away by the flood.
066	REV	012	016	But the earth helped the woman, and opened it's mouth, and swallowed up the flood, which the dragon threw out of his mouth.
066	REV	012	017	Then the dragon was enraged against the woman, and went away to make war with the rest of her seed, who keep the commandments of God, and who have the testimony of Jesus Christ.
066	REV	013	001	And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and I saw a beast rising up out of the sea, which had seven heads and ten horns; and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the names of blasphemy.
066	REV	013	002	And the beast which I saw was like a leopard, and his feet as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his throne, and great authority.
066	REV	013	003	And I saw one of his heads as it were mortally wounded, but his deadly wound was healed: and all the earth wondered and went after the beast.
066	REV	013	004	And they worshipped the dragon, who gave his power to the beast, and they worshipped the beast likewise, saying, Who is like unto the beast? who is able to make war against him?
066	REV	013	005	And there was given him a mouth speaking great and blasphemous things, and power was given him to make war forty two months.
066	REV	013	006	And he opened his mouth in blasphemies against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and those that dwell in heaven.
066	REV	013	007	And he was permitted to make war upon the saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over every tribe, and tongue, and nation.
066	REV	013	008	So that all who dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.
066	REV	013	009	If any one hath an ear, let him hear. Whosoever leadeth into captivity shall go away into captivity:
066	REV	013	010	and he, that killeth with the sword, shall be slain with the sword. Here then is the patience and faith of the saints.
066	REV	013	011	And I saw another beast ascending out of the earth, and he had two horns like a lamb; but he spake like a dragon.
066	REV	013	012	And he exerciseth all the authority of the first beast in his presence; and makes the earth, and those that dwell in it, to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.
066	REV	013	013	And he doth great wonders, so that even maketh fire to come down from heaven to earth in the sight of men; and deceiveth those that dwell on the earth,
066	REV	013	014	by the signs which it was given him to do in the presence of the beast, telling the inhabitants of the earth to make an image to the beast, that had received the wound of the sword, and yet lived.
066	REV	013	015	And he was permitted to give life to the image of the beast, that it might both speak, and cause all those who would not worship the image of the beast to be slain.
066	REV	013	016	And he maketh all, both small and great, rich and poor, free-men and slaves, to receive a mark on their right hand, or on their foreheads: and that no one might buy or sell,
066	REV	013	017	but he that hath the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.
066	REV	013	018	Here is wisdom required; and let him, that hath understanding, compute the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man, and his number is six hundred sixty six.
066	REV	014	001	Then I looked and behold a Lamb standing on mount Sion, and with Him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father's name written on their foreheads.
066	REV	014	002	And I heard a voice from heaven, like the noise of many waters, and as the sound of great thunder; and I heard the sound of harpers playing on their harps:
066	REV	014	003	and they sung as it were a new song before the throne; and before the four living ones, and the elders: and none could learn the song, but the hundred and forty four thousand, who are redeemed from the earth.
066	REV	014	004	These are they who were not defiled with women; for they are virgins: these are they who follow the Lamb whithersoever He goeth: these were redeemed from among men, as the first-fruits unto God and the Lamb.
066	REV	014	005	And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are blameless before the throne of God.
066	REV	014	006	And I saw another angel flying in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel, to preach to those that dwell upon the earth, to every nation, and tribe, and tongue,
066	REV	014	007	and people, saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to Him; for the time of his judgement is come: and worship Him that made the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.
066	REV	014	008	And another angel followed, saying, Babylon the great city is fallen, is fallen; because she made all nations drink of the wine of her furious fornication.
066	REV	014	009	And a third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any one worship the beast and his image, and receive the mark on his forehead,
066	REV	014	010	or on his hand, he also shall drink of the wine of God's indignation poured forth without mixture, in the cup of his wrath; and shall be tormented with fire and brimstone, in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb.
066	REV	014	011	And the smoke of their torment ascendeth for ever and ever: and they have no rest, day and night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.
066	REV	014	012	Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.
066	REV	014	013	And I heard a voice from heaven, saying unto me, Write, Blessed are the dead, that die in the Lord, from henceforth: yea, saith the Spirit, for they rest from their labors and their works do follow them.
066	REV	014	014	And I saw, and behold, a white cloud, and one sitting on the cloud like the Son of man; having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.
066	REV	014	015	And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to Him that sat upon the cloud, Put in thy sickle and reap; for the time to reap is come, for the harvest of the earth is ripe.
066	REV	014	016	And He that sat upon the cloud put forth his sickle on the earth, and the earth was reaped.
066	REV	014	017	And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, and he also had a sharp sickle.
066	REV	014	018	And another angel came out from the altar, who had power over the fire; and he called out with a loud cry to Him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Put in thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, for its grapes are ripe.
066	REV	014	019	And the angel put forth his sickle to the earth, and stript the vine of the earth, and cast the grapes into the great wine-press of God's wrath.
066	REV	014	020	And the wine-press was trodden without the city, and blood came out of the wine-press, even to the horses bridles, a thousand six hundred furlongs off.
066	REV	015	001	And I saw another sign in heaven great and wonderful, ---seven angels, having the seven last plagues, for in them the wrath of God is finished.
066	REV	015	002	And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire; and those that had gained the victory from the beast, and from his image, and from his mark, and from the number of his name, standing on the sea of glass, and having harps to celebrate the praises of God.
066	REV	015	003	And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, "Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God almighty; just and true are thy ways, O king of saints: who should not fear thee,
066	REV	015	004	O Lord, and glorify thy name? for thou only art holy: and all the nations shall come and worship before thee; for thy righteous judgements are made manifest."
066	REV	015	005	And after these things I saw, and behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened.
066	REV	015	006	And the seven angels, who had the seven plagues, came out of the temple, clothed in linen pure and bright, and girded about their breasts with girdles of gold.
066	REV	015	007	And one of the four living beings gave to the seven angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever.
066	REV	015	008	And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from the display of his power: so that no one could enter into the temple till the seven plagues of the seven angels should be finished.
066	REV	016	001	And I heard a great voice from the temple, saying to the seven angels, Go and pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon the earth.
066	REV	016	002	And the first angel went forth and poured out his vial upon the earth, and there was a sore and grievous ulcer inflicted upon the men that had the mark of the beast, and upon them that worshipped his image.
066	REV	016	003	And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it became blood like that of a dead man: and every living soul in the sea died.
066	REV	016	004	And the third angel poured out his vial on the rivers and on the fountains of waters; and they became blood.
066	REV	016	005	And I heard the angel of the waters saying, Righteous art Thou, O Lord, who art, and who ever wast; and who art holy, for Thou hast ordered these things: because they have shed the blood of saints and prophets,
066	REV	016	006	and thou hast given them blood to drink; for they are worthy.
066	REV	016	007	And I heard another from the altar, saying, Yea, O Lord God almighty, true and just are thy judgements.
066	REV	016	008	And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun; and power was given him to scorch men with fire.
066	REV	016	009	And men were scorched with great heat, and they blasphemed the name of God, who hath power over these plagues, and they repented not to give Him glory.
066	REV	016	010	And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast; and his kingdom was darkened, and they gnawed their tongues for pain.
066	REV	016	011	And they blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores; and they repented not of their works.
066	REV	016	012	And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates; and its water was dried up, that the way of the kings from the east might be prepared.
066	REV	016	013	And I saw coming out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three impure spirits like frogs:
066	REV	016	014	for they are the spirits of demons, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to bring them together to the battle of that great day of God almighty.
066	REV	016	015	"Behold, I come as a thief: blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, that he may not walk naked, and his shame be seen."
066	REV	016	016	And he gathered them together into a place called in Hebrew Armageddon.
066	REV	016	017	And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and there came forth a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done.
066	REV	016	018	And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as never was since there were men upon the earth, so violent and so great.
066	REV	016	019	And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came into remembrance before God, to give her the cup of the wine of his fierce wrath.
066	REV	016	020	And every island fled, and the mountains were not found.
066	REV	016	021	And great hail-stones of a talent weight came down from heaven upon men: and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great.
066	REV	017	001	And there came one of the seven angels, that had the seven vials, and talked with me and said, Come hither, and I will shew thee the judgement of the great harlot, that sitteth upon many waters:
066	REV	017	002	with whom the kings of the earth have committed whoredom, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her whoredom.
066	REV	017	003	And he transported me in spirit into the wilderness, and I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet-coloured beast, full of blasphemous names, having seven heads and ten horns.
066	REV	017	004	And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand, full of the stench and filth of her whoredom.
066	REV	017	005	And upon her forehead was a name written, "Mystery, Babylon the great, the mother of harlots, and of the abominations of the earth."
066	REV	017	006	And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I wondered with great amazement.
066	REV	017	007	And the angel said unto me, Why dost thou wonder? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman and of the beast that carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and ten horns.
066	REV	017	008	The beast, which thou sawest, was, and is not; but will rise out of the abyss, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth (whose names are not written on the book of life from the foundation of the world) shall wonder, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is to be.
066	REV	017	009	To this the mind that hath wisdom will attend: for the seven heads are seven hills, on which the woman sitteth.
066	REV	017	010	And there are seven kings: five are fallen, one is, and another is not yet come; and when he cometh, he is to continue but a little while.
066	REV	017	011	And the beast that was, and is not, he is the eighth, and is as one of the seven, and goeth into perdition.
066	REV	017	012	And the ten horns, which thou sawest, are ten kings, who have not yet received a kingdom, but shall receive power as kings for a limited time with the beast.
066	REV	017	013	These are of one mind, and will give their power and authority to the beast.
066	REV	017	014	These will make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for He is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and those that are with Him are called, and chosen, and faithful.
066	REV	017	015	And he said unto me, The waters which thou sawest, whereon the harlot sitteth, are people, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.
066	REV	017	016	And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall devour her flesh, and burn her with fire.
066	REV	017	017	For God hath put it into their hearts to do according to his mind, and to perform one and the same purpose, even to give their kingdoms to the beast, till the words of God be accomplished.
066	REV	017	018	And the woman which thou sawest is that great city, which beareth rule over the kings of the earth.
066	REV	018	001	And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was enlightened with his glory.
066	REV	018	002	And he cried with vehemence, and with a loud voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of demons, a den of impure spirits, and a cage for every unclean and hateful bird.
066	REV	018	003	For all nations have drunk of the wine of her furious whoredom, and the kings of the earth have committed whoredom with her, and the merchants of the earth are grown rich by the abundance of her luxury.
066	REV	018	004	And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out from her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye may not suffer by her plagues:
066	REV	018	005	for her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities.
066	REV	018	006	Give to her as she hath given to you, and repay her double according to her works: in the cup, which she hath mixed, mix for her double.
066	REV	018	007	As much as she hath glorified herself and indulged to luxury, so much torment and sorrow give her; because she saith in her heart, I sit as a queen, I am not a widow, and I shall see no sorrow.
066	REV	018	008	Therefore in one day shall her plagues come, even death and mourning and famine; and she shall be burnt with fire: for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her.
066	REV	018	009	And the kings of the earth, who have committed lewdness and lived luxuriously with her, shall bemoan her and lament for her, when they see the smoke of her burning;
066	REV	018	010	standing afar off for fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas, the great city Babylon, that powerful city! for in one hour is thy judgement come.
066	REV	018	011	And the merchants of the earth shall bewail and mourn over her, because no one will buy their merchandize any more:
066	REV	018	012	the lading of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and pearl, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and all sorts of thyine wood, and vessels of ivory, and of the most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble;
066	REV	018	013	and their cinnamon, and perfumes, and sweet ointment, and incense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and cattle, and sheep, and horses, and chariots, and slaves, yea and the souls of men.
066	REV	018	014	And the fruits, which thy soul longed after, are gone from thee, and all thy delicate and splendid things are departed, and thou shalt find them no more.
066	REV	018	015	The merchants of these things, who grew rich by their trade with her, shall stand afar off for fear of her torment, weeping and mourning,
066	REV	018	016	and saying, Alas, alas, the great city, that was clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and adorned with gold, and precious stones, and pearls!
066	REV	018	017	for in one hour is so great wealth laid waste. And every pilot, and all on board the ships, and the mariners, and all that traffic by sea, stood afar off,
066	REV	018	018	and cried out, when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What city is like to this great city?
066	REV	018	019	And they threw dust on their heads, and cried out, weeping and moaning, saying, Alas, alas, that great city, in which all that had ships at sea were enriched by her sumptuous expences! for in one hour she is become desolate.
066	REV	018	020	Rejoice over her, O heaven, and ye holy apostles and prophets, for God hath avenged you on her.
066	REV	018	021	And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great milstone, and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus shall the great city Babylon be thrown down with violence, and never be found more.
066	REV	018	022	And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and pipers, and trumpeters, shall be heard in thee no more: and no artist of any art whatsoever shall be found in thee any more; and the sound of a milstone shall be heard in thee no more.
066	REV	018	023	And the light of a candle shall be seen in thee no more; and the voice of the bridegroom and bride shall be heard no more in thee: for thy merchants were the great men of the earth, and by thy sorceries were all nations deceived.
066	REV	018	024	And herein was found the blood of prophets and saints, and of all that were slain upon the earth.
066	REV	019	001	And after these things I heard a loud voice as of a great multitude in heaven, saying, Alleluia; salvation, and glory, and honor, and power to the Lord our God: for true and righteous are his judgements;
066	REV	019	002	He hath judged the great whore, who corrupted the earth with her fornication, and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand:
066	REV	019	003	(and again they said, Alleluia:) and her smoke ascendeth for ever and ever.
066	REV	019	004	And the four and twenty elders, and the four animals fell down and worshipped God that sat upon the throne, saying, Amen; Alleluia.
066	REV	019	005	And a voice came out from the throne, saying, Praise our God, all ye his servants, and ye that fear Him, both small and great.
066	REV	019	006	And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the noise of many waters, and as the sound of mighty thunders, saying, Alleluia, for the Lord God the almighty reigneth.
066	REV	019	007	Let us rejoice and exult and give glory to Him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready.
066	REV	019	008	And it was given to her, that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and bright: for the fine linen is the righteousness of the saints.
066	REV	019	009	And he said unto me, Write, Happy they who are invited to the marriage-supper of the Lamb. And he said unto me, These are the true words of God.
066	REV	019	010	And I fell at his feet to worship him: and he said unto me, See thou do it not: I am thy fellow-servant, and a fellow-servant of thy brethren, that hold the testimony of Jesus. Worship God. For the Spirit of prophecy is the testimony of Jesus.
066	REV	019	011	And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse, and He that sat upon it is called faithful and true, and in righteousness doth He judge and make war.
066	REV	019	012	His eyes are as a flame of fire, and many crowns on his head: and He hath a name written, which none knoweth but Himself.
066	REV	019	013	And He was clothed with a vesture dipt in blood: and his name is called, "The Word of God."
066	REV	019	014	And the armies in heaven followed Him on white horses, clothed in fine linen white and clean.
066	REV	019	015	And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that He may smite the nations therewith: and He shall rule them with a rod of iron: and He treadeth the wine-press of the indignation and wrath of God almighty.
066	REV	019	016	And He hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, "King of kings, and Lord of lords."
066	REV	019	017	And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven, Come and gather yourselves together to the banquet of the great God;
066	REV	019	018	that ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses and of those that sit upon them, and the flesh of all, both freemen and slaves, both small and great.
066	REV	019	019	And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies gathered together to make war with him that sitteth upon the horse, and against his army.
066	REV	019	020	And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet, who had wrought signs before him, by which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast, and those who worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into the lake of fire burning with brimstone.
066	REV	019	021	And the rest were slain with the sword of Him that sitteth upon the horse, the sword that cometh out of his mouth: and all the fowls of heaven were satiated with their flesh.
066	REV	020	001	And I saw an angel come down from heaven, who had the key of the bottomless pit, and a great chain in his hand.
066	REV	020	002	And he seized the dragon, that old serpent, who is the devil and satan, and bound him a thousand years,
066	REV	020	003	and cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he might deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years be finished: and then he must be loosed for a little time.
066	REV	020	004	And I saw thrones, and persons sat on them, and judgement was given to them: and I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for the testimony of Jesus, and for the word of God; and who had not worshipped the beast, nor his image, and received not his mark upon their forehead, and on their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.
066	REV	020	005	But the rest of the dead lived not again till the thousand years be finished.
066	REV	020	006	This is the first resurrection. Happy and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on these the second death has no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with Him a thousand years.
066	REV	020	007	And when the thousand years are ended,
066	REV	020	008	Satan shall be loosed from his confinement, and shall go forth to deceive the nations, that are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to war, whose number is as the sand of the sea.
066	REV	020	009	And they overspread the surface of the earth, and encompassed the camp of the saints, and the beloved city: but fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them.
066	REV	020	010	And the devil, who deceived them, was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and they shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.
066	REV	020	011	And I saw a great white throne, and Him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled, and no place was found for them.
066	REV	020	012	And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged by the things written in the books, according to their works.
066	REV	020	013	And the sea gave up the dead that were in it; and death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them: and they were judged every one according to their works.
066	REV	020	014	And death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire: this is the second death.
066	REV	020	015	And whosoever was not found written in the book of life, was cast into the lake of fire.
066	REV	021	001	And I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the former heaven and the former earth passed away, and there was no more sea.
066	REV	021	002	And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, descending from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.
066	REV	021	003	And I heard a great voice out of heaven, saying, Behold the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell among them, and they shall be his people, and God himself, even their God, will be with them.
066	REV	021	004	And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes; and there shall be death no more, nor sorrow, nor crying, nor any more pain: for the former things are passed away.
066	REV	021	005	And He that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And He said to me, Write: for these words are true and faithful.
066	REV	021	006	And He said to me, It is done. I am the Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end: I will give to him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely.
066	REV	021	007	He that overcometh shall inherit all things, and I will be a God to him, and he shall be to me a son.
066	REV	021	008	But the fearful, and faithless, and abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars shall have their part in the lake that burneth with fire and brimstone; which is the second death.
066	REV	021	009	And there came unto me one of the seven angels, who had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and he spake with me, saying, Come hither, I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb's wife.
066	REV	021	010	And he carried me away in spirit to a great and high mountain, and he shewed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God, having the glory of God:
066	REV	021	011	and her light was like a most precious stone, even as a Jasper-stone resembling crystal:
066	REV	021	012	having also a great and high wall, with twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels; and there were names inscribed, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel.
066	REV	021	013	On the east three gates; on the north three gates; on the south three gates; and on the west three gates.
066	REV	021	014	And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
066	REV	021	015	And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city, and it's gates, and it's wall.
066	REV	021	016	And the city was four-square, it's length being as much as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed twelve thousand furlongs: the length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.
066	REV	021	017	And he measured the wall of it an hundred forty four cubits according to the measure of a man, for such was that of the angel.
066	REV	021	018	And the structure of its wall was of Jasper, and the city pure gold, like transparent glass.
066	REV	021	019	And the foundations of the wall of the city were set off each with precious stones: the first foundation a jasper, the second sapphire, the third chalcedony,
066	REV	021	020	the fourth an emerald, the fifth sardonyx, the sixth sardius, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprasus, the eleventh jacinth, the twelfth an amethyst.
066	REV	021	021	And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; each of the gates was of one pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold like resplendent glass.
066	REV	021	022	And I saw no temple in it: for the Lord God almighty, and the Lamb, are the temple of it.
066	REV	021	023	And the city hath no need of the sun, nor of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God enlighteneth it, and the Lamb is it's light.
066	REV	021	024	And the nations of those that are saved shall walk in the light of it: and the kings of the earth bring their glory and their honor into it.
066	REV	021	025	And the gates of it are not to be shut by day: for there shall be no night there.
066	REV	021	026	And they shall bring the glory and honor of the nations into it.

066	REV	022	001	And he shewed me a pure river of the water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God, and of the Lamb.
066	REV	022	002	And in the midst of the street, and of the river, which ran on each side, was the tree of life, producing fruits twelve times in the year, yielding its different fruit every month. And the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations.
066	REV	022	003	And every curse shall cease: and the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it, and his servants shall serve Him.
066	REV	022	004	And they shall see his face; and his name shall be on their foreheads.
066	REV	022	005	And there shall be no night there: and they have no need of a candle, nor of the light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light; and they shall reign for ever and ever.
066	REV	022	006	And he said unto me, These words are faithful and true: and the Lord God of the holy prophets hath sent his angel to shew unto his servants what must soon be.
066	REV	022	007	For behold I come quickly: happy is he that keepeth the words of the prophecy of this book.
066	REV	022	008	And I John am he who saw and heard these things: and when I had heard and seen them, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel, who shewed me these things.
066	REV	022	009	And he said unto me, See thou do it not: for I am a fellow-servant of thine, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of those who observe the words of this book: worship God.
066	REV	022	010	And he said unto me, Seal not the words of the prophecy of this book; for the time is near.
066	REV	022	011	Let him, that is unjust, be unjust still: and let him, that is filthy, be filthy still: and let him, that is righteous, be righteous still; and let him, that is holy, be holy still.
066	REV	022	012	And behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to recompense every one according to his work.
066	REV	022	013	I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.
