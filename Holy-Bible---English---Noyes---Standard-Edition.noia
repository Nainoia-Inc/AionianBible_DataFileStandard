# BOOK	018	JOB	Job	Job
018	JOB	001	001	In the land of Uz lived a man whose name was Job. He was an upright and good man, fearing God and departing from evil.
018	JOB	001	002	He had seven sons and three daughters.
018	JOB	001	003	His substance was seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred she-asses, and a great number of servants; so that he was the greatest of all the inhabitants of the East.
018	JOB	001	004	Now it was the custom of his sons to make a feast in their houses, each on his day, and to send and invite their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.
018	JOB	001	005	And when the days of their feasting had gone round, Job used to send for them and sanctify them, and to rise up early in the morning and offer burnt-offerings according to the number of them all; for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and have renounced God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.
018	JOB	001	006	Now on a certain day the sons of God came to present themselves before Jehovah, and Satan also came among them.
018	JOB	001	007	And Jehovah said to Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered Jehovah, and said, From wandering over the earth, and walking up and down in it.
018	JOB	001	008	And Jehovah said to Satan, Hast thou observed my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, an upright and good man, fearing God and departing from evil?
018	JOB	001	009	Then Satan answered Jehovah, Is it for nought that Job feareth God?
018	JOB	001	010	Hast thou not placed a hedge around him, and around his house, and around all his possessions? Thou hast prospered the work of his hands, and his herds are greatly increased in the land.
018	JOB	001	011	But only put forth thy hand, and touch whatever he possesseth, and to thy face will he renounce thee.
018	JOB	001	012	And Jehovah said to Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; but upon him lay not thy hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of Jehovah.
018	JOB	001	013	Now on a certain day the sons and daughters of Job were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house,
018	JOB	001	014	when a messenger came to Job, and said, The oxen were ploughing, and the asses feeding beside them,
018	JOB	001	015	and the Sabaeans fell upon them, and took them away; the servants also they slew with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
018	JOB	001	016	While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God hath fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
018	JOB	001	017	While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldaeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and carried them away; the servants also they slew with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
018	JOB	001	018	While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house;
018	JOB	001	019	and, lo! there came a great wind from the desert, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
018	JOB	001	020	Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped;
018	JOB	001	021	and said, Naked came I forth from my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither. Jehovah gave, and Jehovah hath taken away; blessed be the name of Jehovah!
018	JOB	001	022	In all this Job sinned not, nor uttered vain words against God.
018	JOB	002	001	Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before Jehovah; and Satan came also among them to present himself before Jehovah.
018	JOB	002	002	And Jehovah said to Satan, Whence comest thou? And Satan answered Jehovah, and said, From wandering over the earth, and walking up and down in it.
018	JOB	002	003	Then said Jehovah to Satan, Hast thou observed my servant Job, that there is none like him upon the earth, an upright and good man, fearing God and departing from evil? And still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou didst excite me against him to destroy him without a cause.
018	JOB	002	004	And Satan answered Jehovah, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life.
018	JOB	002	005	But put forth now thy hand, and touch his bone and his flesh, and to thy face will he renounce thee.
018	JOB	002	006	And Jehovah said to Satan, Behold, he is in thy hand; but spare his life.
018	JOB	002	007	Then Satan went forth from the presence of Jehovah, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot to his crown.
018	JOB	002	008	And he took a potsherd to scrape himself withal, and sat down among the ashes.
018	JOB	002	009	Then said his wife to him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity? Renounce God, and die.
018	JOB	002	010	But he said to her, Thou talkest like one of the foolish women. What! shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this, Job sinned not with his lips.
018	JOB	002	011	Now three friends of Job heard of all this evil that had come upon him, and came each one from his home; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite; for they had agreed to come to mourn with him, and to comfort him.
018	JOB	002	012	And they lifted up their eyes at a distance, and knew him not; then they raised their voices and wept, and rent each one his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.
018	JOB	002	013	And they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word to him; for they saw that his grief was very great.
018	JOB	003	001	At length Job opened his mouth, and cursed the day of his birth.
018	JOB	003	002	And Job spake and said:
018	JOB	003	003	Perish the day in which I was born, and the night which said, “A man-child is conceived!”
018	JOB	003	004	Let that day be darkness; Let not God seek it from above; Yea, let not the light shine upon it!
018	JOB	003	005	Let darkness and the shadow of death redeem it; Let a cloud dwell upon it; Let whatever darkeneth the day terrify it!
018	JOB	003	006	As for that night, let darkness seize upon it; Let it not rejoice among the days of the year; Let it not come into the number of the months!
018	JOB	003	007	O let that night be unfruitful! Let there be in it no voice of joy;
018	JOB	003	008	Let them that curse the day curse it, Who are skilful to stir up the leviathan!
018	JOB	003	009	Let the stars of its twilight be darkened; Let it long for light, and have none; Neither let it see the eyelashes of the morning!
018	JOB	003	010	Because it shut not up the doors of my mother's womb, And hid not trouble from mine eyes.
018	JOB	003	011	Why died I not at my birth? Why did I not expire when I came forth from the womb?
018	JOB	003	012	Why did the knees receive me, And why the breasts, that I might suck?
018	JOB	003	013	For now should I lie down and be quiet; I should sleep; then should I be at rest,
018	JOB	003	014	With kings and counsellors of the earth, Who built up for themselves—ruins!
018	JOB	003	015	Or with princes that had gold, And filled their houses with silver;
018	JOB	003	016	Or, as a hidden untimely birth, I had perished; As infants which never saw the light.
018	JOB	003	017	There the wicked cease from troubling; There the weary are at rest.
018	JOB	003	018	There the prisoners rest together; They hear not the voice of the oppressor.
018	JOB	003	019	The small and the great are there, And the servant is free from his master.
018	JOB	003	020	Why giveth He light to him that is in misery, And life to the bitter in soul,
018	JOB	003	021	Who long for death, and it cometh not, And dig for it more than for hid treasures;
018	JOB	003	022	Who rejoice exceedingly, Yea, exult, when they can find a grave?
018	JOB	003	023	Why is light given to a man from whom the way is hid, And whom God hath hedged in?
018	JOB	003	024	For my sighing cometh before I eat, And my groans are poured out like water.
018	JOB	003	025	For that which I dread overtaketh me; That at which I shudder cometh upon me.
018	JOB	003	026	I have no peace, nor quiet, nor respite: Misery cometh upon me continually.
018	JOB	004	001	Then spake Eliphaz the Temanite, and said:
018	JOB	004	002	If one attempt a word with thee, wilt thou be offended? But who can refrain from speaking?
018	JOB	004	003	Behold, thou hast admonished many; Thou hast strengthened feeble hands;
018	JOB	004	004	Thy words have upheld him that was falling, And thou hast given strength to feeble knees.
018	JOB	004	005	But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; It toucheth thee, and thou art confounded!
018	JOB	004	006	Is not thy fear of God thy hope, And the uprightness of thy ways thy confidence?
018	JOB	004	007	Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished being innocent? Or where have the righteous been cut off?
018	JOB	004	008	According to what I have seen, they who plough iniquity, And sow mischief, reap the same.
018	JOB	004	009	By the blast of God they perish, And by the breath of his nostrils they are consumed.
018	JOB	004	010	The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, And the teeth of the young lions are broken.
018	JOB	004	011	The fierce lion perisheth for lack of prey, And the whelps of the lioness are scattered abroad.
018	JOB	004	012	A word was once secretly brought to me, And mine ear caught a whisper thereof.
018	JOB	004	013	Amid thoughts from visions of the night, When deep sleep falleth upon men,
018	JOB	004	014	A fear and a horror came upon me, Which made all my bones to shake.
018	JOB	004	015	Then a spirit passed before my face, The hair of my flesh rose on end;
018	JOB	004	016	It stood still, but its form I could not discern; An image was before mine eyes; There was silence, and I heard a voice:
018	JOB	004	017	“Shall mortal man be more just than God? Shall man be more pure than his Maker?
018	JOB	004	018	Behold, he putteth no trust in his ministering spirits, And his angels he chargeth with frailty.
018	JOB	004	019	What then are they who dwell in houses of clay, Whose foundation is in the dust, Who crumble to pieces, as if moth-eaten!
018	JOB	004	020	Between morning and evening are they destroyed; They perish for ever, and none regardeth it.
018	JOB	004	021	The excellency that is in them is torn away; They die before they have become wise.”
018	JOB	005	001	Call now, see if any will answer thee! And to which of the holy ones wilt thou look?
018	JOB	005	002	Verily grief destroyeth the fool, And wrath consumeth the weak man.
018	JOB	005	003	I have seen an impious man taking root, But soon I cursed his habitation.
018	JOB	005	004	His children are far from safety; They are oppressed at the gate, and there is none to deliver them.
018	JOB	005	005	His harvest the hungry devour, Carrying it even through the thorns; And a snare gapeth after his substance.
018	JOB	005	006	For affliction cometh not from the dust, Nor doth trouble spring up from the ground;
018	JOB	005	007	Behold, man is born to trouble, As the sparks fly upward.
018	JOB	005	008	I would look to God, And to God would I commit my cause,
018	JOB	005	009	Who doeth great things and unsearchable; Yea, marvellous things without number;
018	JOB	005	010	Who giveth rain upon the earth, And sendeth water upon the fields;
018	JOB	005	011	Who placeth the lowly in high places, And restoreth the afflicted to prosperity;
018	JOB	005	012	Who disappointeth the devices of the crafty, So that their hands cannot perform their enterprises;
018	JOB	005	013	Who taketh the wise in their own craftiness, And bringeth to nought the counsel of the artful.
018	JOB	005	014	They meet with darkness in the daytime; They grope at noon as if it were night.
018	JOB	005	015	So he saveth the persecuted from their mouth; The oppressed from the hand of the mighty.
018	JOB	005	016	So the poor hath hope, And iniquity stoppeth her mouth.
018	JOB	005	017	Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth; Therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty.
018	JOB	005	018	For he bruiseth, and bindeth up; He woundeth, and his hands make whole.
018	JOB	005	019	In six troubles will he deliver thee; Yea, in seven shall no evil touch thee.
018	JOB	005	020	In famine he will redeem thee from death, And in war from the power of the sword.
018	JOB	005	021	Thou shalt be safe from the scourge of the tongue, And shalt not be afraid of destruction, when it cometh.
018	JOB	005	022	At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh, And of the wild beasts of the land shalt thou not be afraid.
018	JOB	005	023	For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field; Yea, the beasts of the forest shall be at peace with thee.
018	JOB	005	024	Thou shalt find that thy tent is in peace; Thou shalt visit thy dwelling, and not be disappointed.
018	JOB	005	025	Thou shalt see thy descendants numerous, And thine offspring as the grass of the earth.
018	JOB	005	026	Thou shalt come to thy grave in full age, As a shock of corn gathered in its season.
018	JOB	005	027	Lo! this we have searched out; so it is: Hear it, and lay it up in thy mind!
018	JOB	006	001	Then Job answered and said:
018	JOB	006	002	O that my grief were weighed thoroughly! That my calamities were put together in the balance!
018	JOB	006	003	Surely they would be heavier than the sand of the sea; On this account were my words rash.
018	JOB	006	004	For the arrows of the Almighty have pierced me; Their poison drinketh up my spirit; The terrors of God set themselves in array against me.
018	JOB	006	005	Doth the wild ass bray in the midst of grass? Or loweth the ox over his fodder?
018	JOB	006	006	Can that which is unsavory be eaten without salt? Is there any taste in the white of an egg?
018	JOB	006	007	That which my soul abhorreth to touch Hath become my loathsome food.
018	JOB	006	008	O that I might have my request, And that God would grant me that which I long for!
018	JOB	006	009	That it would please God to destroy me; That he would let loose his hand, and make an end of me!
018	JOB	006	010	Yet it should still be my consolation, Yea, in unsparing anguish I would exult, That I have not denied the commands of the Holy One.
018	JOB	006	011	What is my strength, that I should hope? And what mine end, that I should be patient?
018	JOB	006	012	Is my strength the strength of stones? Or is my flesh brass?
018	JOB	006	013	Alas, there is no help within me! Deliverance is driven from me!
018	JOB	006	014	To the afflicted, kindness should be shown by a friend; Else he casteth off the fear of the Almighty.
018	JOB	006	015	But my brethren are faithless like a brook; Like streams of the valley that pass away;
018	JOB	006	016	Which are turbid by reason of the ice, And the snow, which hideth itself in them.
018	JOB	006	017	As soon as they flow forth, they vanish; When the heat cometh, they are dried up from their place.
018	JOB	006	018	The caravans turn aside to them on their way; They go up into the desert, and perish.
018	JOB	006	019	The caravans of Tema look for them; The companies of Sheba expect to see them;
018	JOB	006	020	They are ashamed that they have relied on them; They come to their place, and are confounded.
018	JOB	006	021	So ye also are nothing; Ye see a terror, and shrink back.
018	JOB	006	022	Have I said, Bring me gifts? Or, Give a present for me out of your substance?
018	JOB	006	023	Or, Deliver me from the enemy's hand? Or, Rescue me from the hand of the violent?
018	JOB	006	024	Convince me, and I will hold my peace; Cause me to understand wherein I have erred.
018	JOB	006	025	How powerful are the words of truth! But what do your reproaches prove?
018	JOB	006	026	Do ye mean to censure words? The words of a man in despair are but wind.
018	JOB	006	027	Truly ye spread a net for the fatherless; Ye dig a pit for your friend.
018	JOB	006	028	Look now upon me, I pray you; For to your very face can I speak falsehood?
018	JOB	006	029	Return, I pray, and let there be no unfairness; Yea, return; —still is my cause righteous.
018	JOB	006	030	Is there iniquity on my tongue? Cannot my taste discern what is sinful?
018	JOB	007	001	Is there not a war-service for man on the earth? Are not his days as the days of a hireling?
018	JOB	007	002	As a servant panteth for the shade, And as a hireling looketh for his wages,
018	JOB	007	003	So am I made to possess months of affliction, And wearisome nights are appointed for me.
018	JOB	007	004	If I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? And I am full of restlessness until the dawning of the day.
018	JOB	007	005	My flesh is clothed with worms, and clods of dust; My skin is broken and become loathsome.
018	JOB	007	006	My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle; They pass away without hope.
018	JOB	007	007	O remember that my life is a breath; That mine eye shall no more see good!
018	JOB	007	008	The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more; Thine eyes shall look for me, but I shall not be.
018	JOB	007	009	As the cloud dissolveth and wasteth away, So he that goeth down to the grave shall arise no more;
018	JOB	007	010	No more shall he return to his house, And his dwelling-place shall know him no more.
018	JOB	007	011	Therefore I will not restrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
018	JOB	007	012	Am I a sea, or a sea-monster, That thou settest a watch over me?
018	JOB	007	013	When I say, My bed shall relieve me, My couch shall ease my complaint,
018	JOB	007	014	Then thou scarest me with dreams, And terrifiest me with visions;
018	JOB	007	015	So that my soul chooseth strangling, Yea, death, rather than these my bones.
018	JOB	007	016	I am wasting away; I shall not live alway: Let me alone, for my days are a vapor!
018	JOB	007	017	What is man, that thou shouldst make great account him, And fix thy mind upon him?—
018	JOB	007	018	That thou shouldst visit him every morning, And prove him every moment?
018	JOB	007	019	How long ere thou wilt look away from me, And let me alone, till I have time to breathe?
018	JOB	007	020	If I have sinned, what have I done to thee, O thou watcher of men! Why hast thou set me up as thy mark, So that I have become a burden to myself?
018	JOB	007	021	And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, And take away mine iniquity? For soon shall I sleep in the dust; And, though thou seek me diligently, I shall not be.
018	JOB	008	001	Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said:
018	JOB	008	002	How long wilt thou speak such things? How long shall the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind?
018	JOB	008	003	Will God pervert judgment? Or will the Almighty pervert justice?
018	JOB	008	004	As thy children sinned against him, He hath given them up to their transgression.
018	JOB	008	005	But if thou wilt seek early to God, And make thy supplication to the Almighty, —
018	JOB	008	006	If thou wilt be pure and upright, Surely he will yet arise for thee, And prosper thy righteous habitation;
018	JOB	008	007	So that thy beginning shall be small, And thy latter end very great.
018	JOB	008	008	For inquire, I pray thee, of the former age, And mark what hath been searched out by their fathers;
018	JOB	008	009	(For we are of yesterday and know nothing, Since our days upon the earth are but a shadow; )
018	JOB	008	010	Will not they instruct thee, and tell thee, And utter words from their understanding?
018	JOB	008	011	“Can the paper-reed grow up without mire? Can the bulrush grow without water?
018	JOB	008	012	While it is yet in its greenness, and is not cut down, It withereth before any other herb.
018	JOB	008	013	Such is the fate of all who forget God; So perisheth the hope of the ungodly.
018	JOB	008	014	His confidence shall come to nought, And his trust shall prove a spider's web.
018	JOB	008	015	He shall lean upon his house, and it shall not stand; He shall lay fast hold on it, but it shall not endure.
018	JOB	008	016	He is in full green before the sun, And his branches shoot forth over his garden;
018	JOB	008	017	His roots are entwined about the heap, And he seeth the place of stones;
018	JOB	008	018	When he shall be destroyed from his place, It shall deny him, saying, 'I never saw thee.'
018	JOB	008	019	Lo! such is the joy of his course! And others shall spring up from his place”
018	JOB	008	020	Behold, God will not cast away an upright man; Nor will he help the evil-doers.
018	JOB	008	021	While he filleth thy mouth with laughter, And thy lips with gladness,
018	JOB	008	022	They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame, And the dwelling-place of the wicked shall come to nought.
018	JOB	009	001	Then Job answered and said:
018	JOB	009	002	Of a truth, I know that it is so: For how can man be just before God?
018	JOB	009	003	If he choose to contend with him, He cannot answer him to one charge of a thousand.
018	JOB	009	004	He is excellent in wisdom, mighty in strength: Who hath hardened himself against him, and prospered?
018	JOB	009	005	He removeth the mountains, and they know it not; He overturneth them in his anger.
018	JOB	009	006	He shaketh the earth out of her place, And the pillars thereof tremble.
018	JOB	009	007	He commandeth the sun, and it riseth not, And he sealeth up the stars.
018	JOB	009	008	He alone spreadeth out the heavens, And walketh upon the high waves of the sea.
018	JOB	009	009	He made the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades, And the secret chambers of the South.
018	JOB	009	010	He doeth great things past finding out, Yea, wonderful things without number.
018	JOB	009	011	Lo! he goeth by me, but I see him not; He passeth along, but I do not perceive him.
018	JOB	009	012	Lo! he seizeth, and who can hinder him? Who will say to him, What doest thou?
018	JOB	009	013	God will not turn away his anger; The proud helpers are brought low before him.
018	JOB	009	014	How much less shall I answer him, And choose out words to contend with him?
018	JOB	009	015	Though I were innocent, I would not answer him; I would cast myself on the mercy of my judge.
018	JOB	009	016	Should I call, and he make answer to me, I could not believe that he listened to my voice, —
018	JOB	009	017	He who falleth upon me with a tempest, And multiplieth my wounds without cause!
018	JOB	009	018	Who will not suffer me to take my breath, But filleth me with bitterness!
018	JOB	009	019	If I look to strength, “Lo! here am I!” [[saith he, ]] If to justice, “Who shall summon me to trial?”
018	JOB	009	020	Though I were upright, yet must my own mouth condemn me; Though I were innocent, He would prove me perverse.
018	JOB	009	021	Though I were innocent, I would not care for myself; I would despise my life.
018	JOB	009	022	It is all one; therefore I will affirm, He destroyeth the righteous and the wicked alike.
018	JOB	009	023	When the scourge bringeth sudden destruction, He laugheth at the sufferings of the innocent.
018	JOB	009	024	The earth is given into the hands of the wicked; He covereth the face of the judges thereof; If it be not He, who is it?
018	JOB	009	025	My days have been swifter than a courier; They have fled away; they have seen no good.
018	JOB	009	026	They have gone by like the reed-skiffs; Like the eagle, darting upon his prey.
018	JOB	009	027	If I say, I will forget my lamentation, I will change my countenance, and take courage,
018	JOB	009	028	Still am I in dread of the multitude of my sorrows; For I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent.
018	JOB	009	029	I shall be found guilty; Why then should I labor in vain?
018	JOB	009	030	If I wash myself in snow, And cleanse my hands with lye,
018	JOB	009	031	Still wilt thou plunge me into the pit, So that my own clothes will abhor me.
018	JOB	009	032	For He is not a man, as I am, that I may contend with him, And that we may go together into judgment;
018	JOB	009	033	There is no umpire between us, Who may lay his hand upon us both.
018	JOB	009	034	Let him take from me his rod, And not dismay me with his terrors,
018	JOB	009	035	Then I will speak, and not be afraid of him: For I am not so at heart.
018	JOB	010	001	I am weary of my life; I will let loose within me my complaint; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.
018	JOB	010	002	I will say unto God, Do not condemn me! Show me wherefore thou contendest with me!
018	JOB	010	003	Is it a pleasure to thee to oppress, And to despise the work of thy hands, And to shine upon the plans of the wicked?
018	JOB	010	004	Hast thou eyes of flesh, Or seest thou as man seeth?
018	JOB	010	005	Are thy days as the days of a man, Are thy years as the days of a mortal,
018	JOB	010	006	That thou seekest after my iniquity, And searchest after my sin,
018	JOB	010	007	Though thou knowest that I am not guilty, And that none can deliver from thy hand?
018	JOB	010	008	Have thy hands completely fashioned and made me In every part, that thou mightst destroy me?
018	JOB	010	009	O remember that thou hast moulded me as clay! And wilt thou bring me again to dust?
018	JOB	010	010	Thou didst pour me out as milk, And curdle me as cheese;
018	JOB	010	011	With skin and flesh didst thou clothe me, And strengthen me with bones and sinews;
018	JOB	010	012	Thou didst grant me life and favor, And thy protection preserved my breath:
018	JOB	010	013	Yet these things thou didst lay up in thy heart! I know that this was in thy mind.
018	JOB	010	014	If I sin, then thou markest me, And wilt not acquit me of mine iniquity.
018	JOB	010	015	If I am wicked, —then woe unto me! Yet if righteous, I dare not lift up my head; I am full of confusion, beholding my affliction.
018	JOB	010	016	If I lift it up, like a lion thou huntest me, And again showest thyself terrible unto me.
018	JOB	010	017	Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, And increasest thine anger toward me; New hosts continually rise up against me.
018	JOB	010	018	Why then didst thou bring me forth from the womb? I should have perished, and no eye had seen me;
018	JOB	010	019	I should be as though I had not been; I should have been borne from the womb to the grave.
018	JOB	010	020	Are not my days few? O spare then, And let me alone, that I may be at ease a little while,
018	JOB	010	021	Before I go— whence I shall not return—To the land of darkness and death-shade,
018	JOB	010	022	The land of darkness like the blackness of death-shade, Where is no order, and where the light is as darkness.
018	JOB	011	001	Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said:
018	JOB	011	002	Shall not the multitude of words receive an answer? Shall the man of words be justified?
018	JOB	011	003	Shall thy boastings make men hold their peace? Shalt thou mock, and none put thee to shame?
018	JOB	011	004	Thou sayest, My speech is pure; I am clean in thine eyes, [[O God!]]
018	JOB	011	005	But O that God would speak, And open his lips against thee;
018	JOB	011	006	That he would show thee the secrets of his wisdom, —His wisdom, which is unsearchable! Then shouldst thou know that God forgiveth thee many of thine iniquities.
018	JOB	011	007	Canst thou search out the deep things of God? Canst thou find out the Almighty to perfection?
018	JOB	011	008	'Tis high as heaven, what canst thou do? Deeper than hell, what canst thou know?
018	JOB	011	009	The measure thereof is longer than the earth, And broader than the sea.
018	JOB	011	010	If he apprehend, and bind, and bring to trial, Who shall oppose him?
018	JOB	011	011	For he knoweth the unrighteous; He seeth iniquity, when they do not observe it.
018	JOB	011	012	But vain man is without understanding; Yea, man is born a wild ass's colt.
018	JOB	011	013	If thou direct thy heart, And stretch out thy hands, toward him;
018	JOB	011	014	If thou put away iniquity from thy hand, And let not wickedness dwell in thy habitation, —
018	JOB	011	015	Then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; Yea, thou shalt be steadfast, and have no fear.
018	JOB	011	016	For thou shalt forget thy misery, Or remember it as waters that have passed away.
018	JOB	011	017	Thy life shall be brighter than the noon-day; Now thou art in darkness, thou shalt then be as morning.
018	JOB	011	018	Thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; Now thou art disappointed, thou shalt then rest in safety.
018	JOB	011	019	Thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid; And many shall make suit unto thee.
018	JOB	011	020	But the eyes of the wicked shall be wearied out; They shall find no refuge; Their hope is—the breathing forth of life.
018	JOB	012	001	Then Job answered and said:
018	JOB	012	002	No doubt ye are the whole people! And wisdom will die with you!
018	JOB	012	003	But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you: Yea, who knoweth not such things as these?
018	JOB	012	004	I am become a laughing-stock to my friend, —I who call upon God, that he would answer me! The innocent and upright man is held in derision.
018	JOB	012	005	To calamity belongeth contempt in the mind of one at ease; It is ready for them that slip with the feet.
018	JOB	012	006	The tents of robbers are in prosperity, And they who provoke God are secure, Who carry their God in their hand.
018	JOB	012	007	For ask now the beasts, and they will teach thee; Or the fowls of the air, and they will tell thee;
018	JOB	012	008	Or speak to the earth, and it will instruct thee; And the fishes of the sea will declare unto thee.
018	JOB	012	009	Who among all these doth not know That the hand of Jehovah doeth these things?
018	JOB	012	010	In whose hand is the soul of every living thing, And the breath of all mankind.
018	JOB	012	011	Doth not the ear prove words, As the mouth tasteth meat?
018	JOB	012	012	With the aged is wisdom, And with length of days is understanding.
018	JOB	012	013	With Him are wisdom and strength; With Him counsel and understanding.
018	JOB	012	014	Lo! he pulleth down, and it shall not be rebuilt; He bindeth a man, and he shall not be set loose.
018	JOB	012	015	Lo! he withholdeth the waters, and they are dried up; He sendeth them forth, and they lay waste the earth.
018	JOB	012	016	With him are strength and wisdom; The deceived and the deceiver are his.
018	JOB	012	017	He leadeth counsellors away captive, And judges he maketh fools.
018	JOB	012	018	He looseth the authority of kings, And bindeth their loins with a cord.
018	JOB	012	019	He leadeth priests away captive, And overthroweth the mighty.
018	JOB	012	020	He removeth speech from the trusty, And taketh away judgment from the elders.
018	JOB	012	021	He poureth contempt upon princes, And looseth the girdle of the mighty.
018	JOB	012	022	He revealeth deep things out of darkness, And bringeth the shadow of death to light.
018	JOB	012	023	He exalteth nations, and destroyeth them; He enlargeth nations, and leadeth them captive.
018	JOB	012	024	He taketh away the understanding of the great men of the land, And causeth them to wander in a wilderness, where is no path;
018	JOB	012	025	They grope in the dark without light; He maketh them stagger like a drunken man.
018	JOB	013	001	Lo! all this mine eye hath seen; Mine ear hath heard and understood it.
018	JOB	013	002	What ye know, I know also; I am not inferior to you.
018	JOB	013	003	But O that I might speak with the Almighty! O that I might reason with God!
018	JOB	013	004	For ye are forgers of lies; Physicians of no value, all of you!
018	JOB	013	005	O that ye would altogether hold your peace! This, truly, would be wisdom in you.
018	JOB	013	006	Hear, I pray you, my arguments; Attend to the pleadings of my lips!
018	JOB	013	007	Will ye speak falsehood for God? Will ye utter deceit for him?
018	JOB	013	008	Will ye be partial to his person? Will ye contend earnestly for God?
018	JOB	013	009	Will it be well for you, if he search you thoroughly? Can ye deceive him, as one may deceive a man?
018	JOB	013	010	Surely he will rebuke you, If ye secretly have respect to persons.
018	JOB	013	011	Doth not his majesty make you afraid, And his dread fall upon you?
018	JOB	013	012	Your maxims are words of dust; Your fortresses are fortresses of clay.
018	JOB	013	013	Hold your peace, and let me speak: And then come upon me what will!
018	JOB	013	014	Why do I take my flesh in my teeth, And put my life in my hand?
018	JOB	013	015	Lo! he slayeth me, and I have no hope! Yet will I justify my ways before him.
018	JOB	013	016	This also shall be my deliverance; For no unrighteous man will come before him.
018	JOB	013	017	Hear attentively my words, And give ear to my declaration!
018	JOB	013	018	Behold, I have now set in order my cause; I know that I am innocent.
018	JOB	013	019	Who is he that can contend with me? For then would I hold my peace, and die!
018	JOB	013	020	Only do not unto me two things, Then will I not hide myself from thy presence;
018	JOB	013	021	Let not thy hand be heavy upon me, And let not thy terrors make me afraid:
018	JOB	013	022	Then call upon me, and I will answer; Or I will speak, and answer thou me.
018	JOB	013	023	How many are my iniquities and sins? Make me to know my faults and transgressions.
018	JOB	013	024	Wherefore dost thou hide thy face, And account me as thine enemy?
018	JOB	013	025	Wilt thou put in fear the driven leaf? Wilt thou pursue the dry stubble?
018	JOB	013	026	For thou writest bitter things against me, And makest me inherit the sins of my youth.
018	JOB	013	027	Yea, thou puttest my feet in the stocks, And waterest all my paths; Thou hemmest in the soles of my feet.
018	JOB	013	028	And I, like an abandoned thing, shall waste away; Like a garment which is moth-eaten.
018	JOB	014	001	Man, that is born of woman, Is of few days, and full of trouble.
018	JOB	014	002	He cometh forth as a flower, and is cut down; He fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not.
018	JOB	014	003	And dost thou fix thine eyes upon such a one? And dost thou bring me into judgment with thee?
018	JOB	014	004	Who can produce a clean thing from an unclean? Not one.
018	JOB	014	005	Seeing that his days are determined, And the number of his months, with thee, And that thou hast appointed him bounds which he cannot pass,
018	JOB	014	006	O turn thine eyes from him, and let him rest, That he may enjoy, as a hireling, his day!
018	JOB	014	007	For there is hope for a tree, If it be cut down, that it will sprout again, And that its tender branches will not fail;
018	JOB	014	008	Though its root may have grown old in the earth, And though its trunk be dead upon the ground,
018	JOB	014	009	Through the scent of water it will bud, And put forth boughs, like a young plant.
018	JOB	014	010	But man dieth, and he is gone! Man expireth, and where is he?
018	JOB	014	011	The waters fail from the lake; And the stream wasteth and drieth up;
018	JOB	014	012	So man lieth down, and riseth not; Till the heavens be no more, he shall not awake, Nor be roused from his sleep.
018	JOB	014	013	O that thou wouldst hide me in the under-world! That thou wouldst conceal me till thy wrath be past! That thou wouldst appoint me a time, and then remember me!
018	JOB	014	014	If a man die, can he live again? All the days of my war-service would I wait, Till my change should come.
018	JOB	014	015	Thou wilt call, and I will answer thee; Thou wilt have compassion upon the work of thy hands!
018	JOB	014	016	But now thou numberest my steps; Thou watchest over my sins.
018	JOB	014	017	My transgression is sealed up in a bag; Yea, thou addest unto my iniquity.
018	JOB	014	018	As the mountain falling cometh to nought, And the rock is removed from its place;
018	JOB	014	019	As the waters wear away the stones, And the floods wash away the dust of the earth, So thou destroyest the hope of man.
018	JOB	014	020	Thou prevailest against him continually, and he perisheth; Thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away.
018	JOB	014	021	His sons come to honor, but he knoweth it not; Or they are brought low, but he perceiveth it not.
018	JOB	014	022	But his flesh shall have pain for itself alone; For itself alone shall his soul mourn.
018	JOB	015	001	Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said:
018	JOB	015	002	Should a wise man answer with arguments of wind, Or fill his bosom with the east wind?
018	JOB	015	003	Should he argue with speech that helpeth him not, And with words which do not profit him?
018	JOB	015	004	Behold, thou makest the fear of God a vain thing, And discouragest prayer before him.
018	JOB	015	005	Yea, thy own mouth proclaimeth thy iniquity, Though thou choosest the tongue of the crafty.
018	JOB	015	006	Thy own mouth condemneth thee, and not I; Thy own lips testify against thee.
018	JOB	015	007	Art thou the first man that was born? Wast thou formed before the hills?
018	JOB	015	008	Hast thou listened in the council of God, And drawn all wisdom to thyself?
018	JOB	015	009	What dost thou know, that we know not also? What dost thou understand, that is a secret to us?
018	JOB	015	010	With us are the aged and hoary-headed; Much older than thy father.
018	JOB	015	011	Dost thou despise the consolations of God, And words so full of kindness to thee?
018	JOB	015	012	Why hath thy passion taken possession of thee? And why this winking of thine eyes?
018	JOB	015	013	For against God hast thou turned thy spirit, And uttered such words from thy mouth.
018	JOB	015	014	What is man, that he should be pure, And he that is born of woman, that he should be innocent?
018	JOB	015	015	Behold, He putteth no trust in his ministering spirits, And the heavens are not pure in his sight;
018	JOB	015	016	Much less, abominable and polluted man, Who drinketh iniquity as water.
018	JOB	015	017	Hear me, and I will show thee, And that which I have seen will I declare;
018	JOB	015	018	Which the wise men have told, And not kept concealed, as received from their fathers;
018	JOB	015	019	To whom alone the land was given, And among whom not a stranger wandered.
018	JOB	015	020	“All his days the wicked man is in pain; Yea, all the years, that are laid up for the oppressor.
018	JOB	015	021	A fearful sound is in his ears; In peace the destroyer cometh upon him.
018	JOB	015	022	He hath no hope that he shall escape from darkness; He is set apart for the sword.
018	JOB	015	023	He wandereth about, seeking bread; He knoweth that a day of darkness is at hand.
018	JOB	015	024	Distress and anguish fill him with dread; They prevail against him like a king ready for the battle.
018	JOB	015	025	Because he stretched forth his hand against God, And bade defiance to the Almighty,
018	JOB	015	026	And ran against him with outstretched neck, With the thick bosses of his bucklers;
018	JOB	015	027	Because he covered his face with fatness, And gathered fat upon his loins,
018	JOB	015	028	And dwelt in desolated cities, In houses which no man inhabiteth, That are ready to become heaps.
018	JOB	015	029	He shall not be rich; his substance shall not endure, And his possessions shall not be extended upon the earth.
018	JOB	015	030	He shall not escape from darkness, And the flame shall dry up his branches; Yea, by the breath of His mouth shall he be taken away.
018	JOB	015	031	“Let not man trust in vanity! he will be deceived; For vanity shall be his recompense.
018	JOB	015	032	He shall come to his end before his time, And his branch shall not be green.
018	JOB	015	033	He shall shake off his unripe fruit like the vine, And shed his blossoms like the olive-tree.
018	JOB	015	034	The house of the unrighteous shall be famished, And fire shall consume the tents of bribery.
018	JOB	015	035	They conceive mischief, and bring forth misery, And their breast deviseth deceit.”
018	JOB	016	001	But Job answered and said:
018	JOB	016	002	Of such things as these I have heard enough! Miserable comforters are ye all!
018	JOB	016	003	Will there ever be an end to words of wind? What stirreth thee up, that thou answerest?
018	JOB	016	004	I also might speak like you, If ye were now in my place; I might string together words against you, And shake my head at you.
018	JOB	016	005	I would strengthen you with my mouth, And the consolation of my lips should sustain you.
018	JOB	016	006	If I speak, my grief is not assuaged; And if I forbear, it doth not leave me.
018	JOB	016	007	For now He hath quite exhausted me; Thou hast desolated all my house!
018	JOB	016	008	Thou hast seized hold of me, and this is a witness against me; My leanness riseth up and testifieth against me to my face.
018	JOB	016	009	His anger teareth my flesh, and pursueth me; He gnasheth upon me with his teeth; My adversary sharpeneth his eyes upon me.
018	JOB	016	010	They gape for me with their mouths; In scorn they smite me on the cheek; With one consent they assemble against me.
018	JOB	016	011	God hath given me a prey to the unrighteous, And delivered me into the hands of the wicked.
018	JOB	016	012	I was at ease, but he hath crushed me; He hath seized me by the neck, and dashed me in pieces; He hath set me up for his mark.
018	JOB	016	013	His archers encompass me around; He pierceth my reins, and doth not spare; He poureth out my gall upon the ground.
018	JOB	016	014	He breaketh me with breach upon breach; He rusheth upon me like a warrior.
018	JOB	016	015	I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, And thrust my horn into the dust.
018	JOB	016	016	My face is red with weeping, And upon my eyelids is deathlike darkness.
018	JOB	016	017	Yet is there no injustice in my bands. And my prayer hath been pure.
018	JOB	016	018	O earth! cover not thou my blood, And let there be no hiding-place for my cry!
018	JOB	016	019	Yet even now, behold, my witness is in heaven, And he who knoweth me is on high.
018	JOB	016	020	My friends have me in derision, But my eye poureth out tears unto God.
018	JOB	016	021	O that one might contend for a man with God, As a man contendeth with his neighbor!
018	JOB	016	022	For when a few years shall have passed, I shall go the way whence I shall not return.
018	JOB	017	001	My breath is exhausted; My days are at an end; The grave is ready for me.
018	JOB	017	002	Are not revilers before me? And doth not my eye dwell upon their provocations?
018	JOB	017	003	Give a pledge, I pray thee; be thou a surety for me with thee; Who is he that will strike hands with me?
018	JOB	017	004	Behold, thou hast blinded their understanding; Therefore thou wilt not suffer them to prevail.
018	JOB	017	005	He who delivereth up his friends as a prey, —The eyes of his children shall fail.
018	JOB	017	006	He made me the by-word of the people; Yea, I have become their abhorrence.
018	JOB	017	007	My eye therefore is dim with sorrow, And all my limbs are as a shadow.
018	JOB	017	008	Upright men will be astonished at this, And the innocent will rouse themselves against the wicked.
018	JOB	017	009	The righteous will also hold on his way, And he that hath clean hands will gather strength.
018	JOB	017	010	But as for you all, return, I pray! I find not yet among you one wise man.
018	JOB	017	011	My days are at an end; My plans are broken off; Even the treasures of my heart.
018	JOB	017	012	Night hath become day to me; The light bordereth on darkness.
018	JOB	017	013	Yea, I look to the grave as my home; I have made my bed in darkness.
018	JOB	017	014	I say to the pit, Thou art my father! And to the worm, My mother! and, My sister!
018	JOB	017	015	Where then is my hope? Yea, my hope, who shall see it?
018	JOB	017	016	It must go down to the bars of the under-world, As soon as there is rest for me in the dust.
018	JOB	018	001	Bildad the Shuhite answered and said:
018	JOB	018	002	How long ere ye make an end of words? Understand, and then we will speak!
018	JOB	018	003	Why are we accounted as brutes, And reputed vile in your sight?
018	JOB	018	004	Thou that tearest thyself in thine anger! Must the earth be deserted for thee, And the rock removed from its place?
018	JOB	018	005	Behold, the light of the wicked shall be put out, And the flame of his fire shall not shine.
018	JOB	018	006	Light shall become darkness in his tent, And his lamp over him shall go out.
018	JOB	018	007	His strong steps shall be straitened, And his own plans shall cast him down.
018	JOB	018	008	He is brought into the net by his own feet, And he walketh upon snares.
018	JOB	018	009	The trap layeth hold of him by the heel, And the snare holdeth him fast.
018	JOB	018	010	A net is secretly laid for him on the ground, And a trap for him in the pathway.
018	JOB	018	011	Terrors affright him on every side, And harass him at his heels.
018	JOB	018	012	His strength is wasted by hunger, And destruction is ready at his side.
018	JOB	018	013	His limbs are consumed, Yea, his limbs are devoured by the first-born of death.
018	JOB	018	014	He is torn from his tent, which was his confidence, And is borne away to the king of terrors.
018	JOB	018	015	They who are none of his shall dwell in his tent; Brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation.
018	JOB	018	016	His roots below shall be dried up, And his branches above shall be withered.
018	JOB	018	017	His memory perisheth from the earth, And no name hath he in the land.
018	JOB	018	018	He shall be thrust from light into darkness, And driven out of the world.
018	JOB	018	019	He hath no son, nor kinsman among his people, Nor any survivor in his dwelling-place.
018	JOB	018	020	They that come after him shall be amazed at his fate, As they that were before them were struck with horror.
018	JOB	018	021	Yea, such is the dwelling of the unrighteous man; Such is the place of him who knoweth not God!
018	JOB	019	001	But Job answered and said:
018	JOB	019	002	How long will ye vex my soul, And break me in pieces with words?
018	JOB	019	003	These ten times have ye reviled me; Without shame do ye stun me!
018	JOB	019	004	And be it, indeed, that I have erred, My error abideth with myself.
018	JOB	019	005	Since, indeed, ye magnify yourselves against me, And plead against me my reproach,
018	JOB	019	006	Know then that it is God who hath brought me low; He hath encompassed me with his net.
018	JOB	019	007	Behold, I complain of wrong, but receive no answer; I cry aloud, but obtain no justice.
018	JOB	019	008	He hath fenced up my way, so that I cannot pass, And hath set darkness in my paths.
018	JOB	019	009	He hath stripped me of my glory, And taken the crown from my head.
018	JOB	019	010	He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone! He hath torn up my hope like a tree.
018	JOB	019	011	He kindleth his anger against me, And counteth me as his enemy.
018	JOB	019	012	His troops advance together against me; They throw up for themselves a way to me, And encamp around my dwelling.
018	JOB	019	013	My brethren he hath put far from me, And my acquaintance are wholly estranged from me.
018	JOB	019	014	My kinsfolk have forsaken me, And my bosom friends have forgotten me.
018	JOB	019	015	The foreigners of my house, yea, my own maid-servants, regard me as a stranger; I am an alien in their eyes.
018	JOB	019	016	I call my servant, and he maketh no answer; With my own mouth do I entreat him.
018	JOB	019	017	My breath is become strange to my wife, And my prayers also to my own mother's sons.
018	JOB	019	018	Even young children despise me; When I rise up, they speak against me.
018	JOB	019	019	All my bosom friends abhor me, And they whom I loved are turned against me.
018	JOB	019	020	My bones cleave to my flesh and my skin, And I have scarcely escaped with the skin of my teeth.
018	JOB	019	021	Have pity upon me, O ye my friends! have pity upon me; For the hand of God hath smitten me!
018	JOB	019	022	Why do ye persecute me like God, And are not satisfied with my flesh?
018	JOB	019	023	O that my words were now written! O that they were marked down in a scroll!
018	JOB	019	024	That with an iron pen, and with lead, They were engraven upon the rock for ever!
018	JOB	019	025	Yet I know that my Vindicator liveth, And will hereafter stand up on the earth;
018	JOB	019	026	And though with my skin this body be wasted away, Yet without my flesh shall I see God.
018	JOB	019	027	Yea, I shall see him my friend; My eyes shall behold him, and not another: For this, my soul panteth within me.
018	JOB	019	028	Since ye say, “How may we persecute him, And find grounds of accusation against him?”
018	JOB	019	029	Be ye afraid of the sword! For malice is a crime for the sword; That ye may know that judgment cometh.
018	JOB	020	001	Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said:
018	JOB	020	002	For this do my thoughts lead me to reply, And for this is my ardor within me.
018	JOB	020	003	I have heard my shameful rebuke; And the spirit, from my understanding, answereth for me.
018	JOB	020	004	Knowest thou not, that from the days of old, From the time when man was placed upon the earth,
018	JOB	020	005	The triumphing of the wicked hath been short, And the joy of the impious but for a moment?
018	JOB	020	006	Though his greatness mount up to the heavens, And his head reach to the clouds,
018	JOB	020	007	Yet shall he perish for ever, and be mingled with dust; They who saw him shall say, Where is he?
018	JOB	020	008	He shall flee away like a dream, and shall not be found; Yea, he shall disappear like a vision of the nigh.
018	JOB	020	009	The eye also which saw him shall see him no more, And his dwelling-place shall never more behold him.
018	JOB	020	010	His sons shall seek the favor of the poor, And their hands shall give back his wealth.
018	JOB	020	011	His bones are full of his youth, But they shall lie down with him in the dust.
018	JOB	020	012	Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, Though he hide it under his tongue,
018	JOB	020	013	Though he cherish it, and will not part with it, And keep it fast in his mouth,
018	JOB	020	014	Yet his meat shall be changed within him, And become to him the poison of asps.
018	JOB	020	015	He hath glutted himself with riches, And he shall throw them up again; Yea, God shall cast them out of his body.
018	JOB	020	016	He shall suck the poison of asps; The tongue of the viper shall destroy him.
018	JOB	020	017	He shall never see the flowing streams, And the rivers of honey and milk.
018	JOB	020	018	The fruits of his toil he shall give back, and shall not enjoy them: It is substance to be restored, and he shall not rejoice therein.
018	JOB	020	019	Because he hath oppressed and abandoned the poor, And seized upon the house which he did not build;
018	JOB	020	020	Because he knew no rest in his bosom, He shall not save that in which he delighteth.
018	JOB	020	021	Because nothing escaped his greediness, His prosperity shall not endure.
018	JOB	020	022	In the fulness of his abundance he shall be brought low; Every hand of the wretched shall come upon him.
018	JOB	020	023	He shall, indeed, have wherewith to fill himself: God shall send upon him the fury of his anger, And rain it down upon him for his food.
018	JOB	020	024	If he fleeth from the iron weapon, The bow of brass shall pierce him through.
018	JOB	020	025	He draweth the arrow, and it cometh forth from his body; Yea, the glittering steel cometh out of his gall. Terrors are upon him;
018	JOB	020	026	Calamity of every kind is treasured up for him. A fire not blown shall consume him; It shall consume whatever is left in his tent.
018	JOB	020	027	The heavens shall reveal his iniquity, And the earth shall rise up against him.
018	JOB	020	028	The substance of his house shall disappear; It shall flow away in the day of His wrath.
018	JOB	020	029	Such is the portion of the wicked man from God, And the inheritance appointed for him by the Almighty.
018	JOB	021	001	But Job answered and said:
018	JOB	021	002	Hear attentively my words, And let this be your consolation.
018	JOB	021	003	Bear with me, that I may speak; And after I have spoken, mock on!
018	JOB	021	004	Is my complaint concerning man? Why then should I not be angry?
018	JOB	021	005	Look upon me, and be astonished, And lay your hand upon your mouth!
018	JOB	021	006	When I think of it, I am confounded; Trembling taketh hold of my flesh.
018	JOB	021	007	Why is it that the wicked live, Grow old, yea, become mighty in substance?
018	JOB	021	008	Their children are established in their sight with them, And their offspring before their eyes.
018	JOB	021	009	Their houses are in peace, without fear, And the rod of God cometh not upon them.
018	JOB	021	010	Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; Their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf.
018	JOB	021	011	They send forth their little ones like a flock, And their children dance.
018	JOB	021	012	They sing to the timbrel and harp, And rejoice at the sound of the pipe.
018	JOB	021	013	They spend their days in prosperity, And in a moment go down to the under-world.
018	JOB	021	014	And yet they say unto God, “Depart from us! We desire not the knowledge of thy ways!
018	JOB	021	015	Who is the Almighty, that we should serve him? And what will it profit us, if we pray to him?”
018	JOB	021	016	[[Ye say, ]] “Lo! their prosperity is not secure in their hands! Far from me be the conduct of the wicked!”
018	JOB	021	017	How often is it, that the lamp of the wicked is put out? And that destruction cometh upon them, And that He dispenseth to them tribulations in his anger?
018	JOB	021	018	How often are they as stubble before the wind, Or as chaff, which the whirlwind carrieth away?
018	JOB	021	019	“But” [[say ye]] “God layeth up his iniquity for his children.” Let him requite the offender, and let him feel it!
018	JOB	021	020	Let his own eyes see his destruction, And let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty!
018	JOB	021	021	For what concern hath he for his household after him, When the number of his own months is completed?
018	JOB	021	022	Who then shall impart knowledge to God, —To him that judgeth the highest?
018	JOB	021	023	One dieth in the fulness of his prosperity, Being wholly at ease and quiet;
018	JOB	021	024	His sides are full of fat, And his bones moist with marrow.
018	JOB	021	025	Another dieth in bitterness of soul, And hath not tasted pleasure.
018	JOB	021	026	Alike they lie down in the dust, And the worms cover them.
018	JOB	021	027	Behold, I know your thoughts, And the devices by which ye wrong me.
018	JOB	021	028	For ye say, “Where is the house of the oppressor, And where the dwelling-places of the wicked?”
018	JOB	021	029	Have ye never inquired of travellers, And do ye not know their tokens,
018	JOB	021	030	That the wicked is spared in the day of destruction, And that he is borne to his grave in the day of wrath?
018	JOB	021	031	Who will charge him with his conduct to his face, And who will requite him for the evil he hath done?
018	JOB	021	032	Even this man is borne with honor to the grave; Yea, he watcheth over his tomb.
018	JOB	021	033	Sweet to him are the sods of the valley: And all men move after him, As multitudes without number before him.
018	JOB	021	034	Why then do ye offer your vain consolations? Your answers continue false.
018	JOB	022	001	Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said:
018	JOB	022	002	Can a man, then, profit God? Behold, the wise man profiteth himself.
018	JOB	022	003	Is it a pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous; Or a gain to him, that thou walkest uprightly?
018	JOB	022	004	Will he contend with thee because he feareth thee? Will he enter with thee into judgment?
018	JOB	022	005	Hath not thy wickedness been great? Have not thine iniquities been numberless?
018	JOB	022	006	For thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother unjustly, And stripped the poor of their clothing.
018	JOB	022	007	Thou hast given the weary no water to drink, And withholden bread from the hungry.
018	JOB	022	008	But the man of power, his was the land, And the honorable man dwelt in it.
018	JOB	022	009	Thou hast sent widows away empty, And broken the arms of the fatherless.
018	JOB	022	010	Therefore snares are round about thee, And sudden fear confoundeth thee;
018	JOB	022	011	Or darkness, through which thou canst not see, And floods of water cover thee.
018	JOB	022	012	Is not God in the height of heaven? And behold the stars, how high they are!
018	JOB	022	013	Hence thou sayest, “What doth God know? Can he govern behind the thick darkness?
018	JOB	022	014	Dark clouds are a veil to him, and he cannot see; And he walketh upon the arch of heaven.”
018	JOB	022	015	Wilt thou take the old way Which wicked men have trodden,
018	JOB	022	016	Who were cut down before their time, And whose foundations were swept away by a flood?
018	JOB	022	017	Who said unto God, “Depart from us!” And, “What can the Almighty do to us?”
018	JOB	022	018	And yet he filled their houses with good things!—Far from me be the counsel of the wicked!
018	JOB	022	019	The righteous see their fate, and rejoice; And the innocent hold them in derision.
018	JOB	022	020	“Truly our adversary is destroyed, And fire hath consumed his abundance!”
018	JOB	022	021	Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: Thus shall prosperity return to thee.
018	JOB	022	022	Receive, I pray thee, instruction from his mouth, And lay up his words in thy heart.
018	JOB	022	023	If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up; If thou put away iniquity from thy tent.
018	JOB	022	024	Cast to the dust thy gold, And the gold of Ophir to the stones of the brook:
018	JOB	022	025	Then shall the Almighty be thy gold, Yea, treasures of silver unto thee;
018	JOB	022	026	For then shalt thou have delight in the Almighty, And shalt lift up thy face unto God.
018	JOB	022	027	Thou shalt pray to him, and he shall hear thee, And thou shalt perform thy vows.
018	JOB	022	028	The purpose which thou formest shall prosper with thee, And light shall shine upon thy ways.
018	JOB	022	029	When men are cast down, thou shalt say, “There lifting up!” And the humble person he will save.
018	JOB	022	030	He will deliver even him that is not innocent. The purity of thy hands shall save him.
018	JOB	023	001	Then Job answered and said:
018	JOB	023	002	Still is my complaint bitter; But my wound is deeper than my groaning.
018	JOB	023	003	O that I knew where I might find him! That I might go before his throne!
018	JOB	023	004	I would order my cause before him, And fill my mouth with arguments;
018	JOB	023	005	I should know what he would answer me, And understand what he would say to me.
018	JOB	023	006	Would he contend with me with his mighty power? No! he would have regard to me.
018	JOB	023	007	Then would an upright man contend with him, And I should be fully acquitted by my judge.
018	JOB	023	008	But, behold, I go eastward, and he is not there; And westward, but I cannot perceive him;
018	JOB	023	009	To the north, where he worketh, but I cannot behold him; He hideth himself on the south, and I cannot see him.
018	JOB	023	010	But he knoweth the way which is in my heart; When he trieth me, I shall come forth as gold.
018	JOB	023	011	My feet have trodden in his steps; His way I have kept, and have not turned aside from it.
018	JOB	023	012	I have not neglected the precepts of his lips; Above my own law have I esteemed the words of his mouth.
018	JOB	023	013	But he is of one mind, and who can turn him? And what he desireth, that he doeth.
018	JOB	023	014	He performeth that which is appointed for me; And many such things are in his mind!
018	JOB	023	015	Therefore I am in terror on account of him; When I consider, I am afraid of him.
018	JOB	023	016	For God maketh my heart faint; Yea, the Almighty terrifieth me;
018	JOB	023	017	Because I was not taken away before darkness came, And he hath not hidden darkness from mine eyes.
018	JOB	024	001	Why are not times treasured up by the Almighty? And why do not they who know him see his days?
018	JOB	024	002	They remove landmarks; They take away flocks by violence, and pasture them.
018	JOB	024	003	They drive away the ass of the fatherless, And take the widow's ox for a pledge.
018	JOB	024	004	They push the needy from the way; All the poor of the land are forced to hide themselves.
018	JOB	024	005	Behold, like wild asses of the desert, they go forth to their work; They search for prey; The wilderness supplieth them food for their children.
018	JOB	024	006	In the fields they reap the harvest, And gather the vintage of the oppressor.
018	JOB	024	007	They lodge naked, without clothing, And without covering from the cold.
018	JOB	024	008	They are drenched with the mountain showers, And embrace the rock for want of shelter.
018	JOB	024	009	The fatherless are torn from the breast, And the garment of the needy is taken for a pledge.
018	JOB	024	010	They go naked, without clothing, And carry the sheaf hungry.
018	JOB	024	011	They make oil within their walls, And tread the wine-vat, yet suffer thirst.
018	JOB	024	012	From anguish the dying groan, And the wounded cry aloud; And God regardeth not their prayer!
018	JOB	024	013	Others hate the light; They know not its ways, And abide not in its paths.
018	JOB	024	014	With the light ariseth the murderer; He killeth the poor and needy; In the night he is as a thief.
018	JOB	024	015	The eye of the adulterer watcheth for the twilight; He saith, “No eye will see me,” And putteth a mask upon his face.
018	JOB	024	016	In the dark they break into houses; In the daytime they shut themselves up; They are strangers to the light.
018	JOB	024	017	The morning is to them the very shadow of death; They are familiar with the terrors of the shadow of death.
018	JOB	024	018	Light are they on the face of the waters; They have an accursed portion in the earth; They come not near the vineyards.
018	JOB	024	019	As drought and heat consume the snow waters, So doth the grave the wicked.
018	JOB	024	020	His own mother forgetteth him; The worm feedeth sweetly on him; He is no more remembered, And iniquity is broken like a tree.
018	JOB	024	021	He oppresseth the barren, that hath not borne, And doeth not good to the widow.
018	JOB	024	022	He taketh away the mighty by his power; He riseth up, and no one is sure of life.
018	JOB	024	023	God giveth them security, so that they are confident; His eyes are upon their ways.
018	JOB	024	024	They are exalted; —in a little while they are gone! They are brought low, and die, like all others; And like the topmost ears of corn are they cut off.
018	JOB	024	025	If it be not so, who will confute me, And show my discourse to be worthless?
018	JOB	025	001	Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said:
018	JOB	025	002	Dominion and fear are with Him; He maintaineth peace in his high places.
018	JOB	025	003	Is there any numbering of his hosts? And upon whom doth not his light arise?
018	JOB	025	004	How then can man be righteous before? Or how can he be pure that is born of woman?
018	JOB	025	005	Behold, even the moon, it shineth not; And the stars are not pure in his sight,
018	JOB	025	006	How much less, man, a worm; And the son of man, a reptile!
018	JOB	026	001	Then Job answered and said:
018	JOB	026	002	How hast thou helped the weak, And strengthened the feeble arm!
018	JOB	026	003	How hast thou counselled the ignorant, And revealed wisdom in fulness!
018	JOB	026	004	For whom hast thou uttered these words? And whose spirit spake through thee?
018	JOB	026	005	Before Him the shades tremble Beneath the waters and their inhabitants.
018	JOB	026	006	The under-world is naked before him, And destruction is without covering.
018	JOB	026	007	He stretcheth out the north over empty space, And hangeth the earth upon nothing.
018	JOB	026	008	He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds, And the cloud is not rent under them.
018	JOB	026	009	He covereth the face of his throne, And spreadeth his clouds upon it.
018	JOB	026	010	He hath drawn a circular bound upon the waters, To the confines of light and darkness.
018	JOB	026	011	The pillars of heaven tremble And are confounded at his rebuke.
018	JOB	026	012	By his power he stilleth the sea, Yea, by his wisdom he smiteth its pride.
018	JOB	026	013	By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; His hand hath formed the fleeing Serpent.
018	JOB	026	014	Lo! these are but the borders of his works; How faint the whisper we have heard of him! But the thunder of his power who can understand?
018	JOB	027	001	Moreover Job continued his discourse, and said:
018	JOB	027	002	As God liveth, who hath rejected my cause, And the Almighty, who hath afflicted my soul;
018	JOB	027	003	As long as my breath is in me, And the spirit of God is in my nostrils,
018	JOB	027	004	Never shall my lips speak falsehood, Nor my tongue utter deceit.
018	JOB	027	005	God forbid that I should acknowledge you to be just: To my last breath will I assert my integrity.
018	JOB	027	006	I will hold fast my innocence, and not let it go; My heart reproacheth me for no part of my life.
018	JOB	027	007	May mine enemy be as the wicked, And he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous!
018	JOB	027	008	For what is the hope of the wicked, when God cutteth off his web, And taketh away his life?
018	JOB	027	009	Will he listen to his cry, When trouble cometh upon him?
018	JOB	027	010	Can he delight himself in the Almighty, And call at all times upon God?
018	JOB	027	011	I will teach you concerning the hand of God; That which is with the Almighty I will not conceal.
018	JOB	027	012	Behold, ye yourselves have all seen it; Why then do ye cherish such vain thoughts?
018	JOB	027	013	This is the portion of the wicked man from God, —The inheritance which oppressors receive from the Almighty.
018	JOB	027	014	If his children be multiplied, it is for the sword; And his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.
018	JOB	027	015	Those of them that escape shall be buried by Death, And their widows shall not bewail them.
018	JOB	027	016	Though he heap up silver as dust, And procure raiment as clay, —
018	JOB	027	017	He may procure, but the righteous shall wear it, And the innocent shall share the silver.
018	JOB	027	018	He buildeth his house like the moth, Or like the shed which the watchman maketh.
018	JOB	027	019	The rich man lieth down, and is not buried; In the twinkling of an eye he is no more.
018	JOB	027	020	Terrors pursue him like a flood; A tempest stealeth him away in the night.
018	JOB	027	021	The east wind carrieth him away, and he perisheth; Yea, it sweepeth him away from his place.
018	JOB	027	022	God sendeth his arrows at him, and doth not spare; He would fain escape from His hand.
018	JOB	027	023	Men clap their hands at him, And hiss him away from his place.
018	JOB	028	001	Truly there is a vein for silver, And a place for gold, which men refine.
018	JOB	028	002	Iron is obtained from earth, And stone is melted into copper.
018	JOB	028	003	Man putteth an end to darkness; He searcheth to the lowest depths For the stone of darkness and the shadow of death.
018	JOB	028	004	From the place where they dwell they open a shaft; Forgotten by the feet, They hang down, they swing away from men.
018	JOB	028	005	The earth, out of which cometh bread, Is torn up underneath, as it were by fire.
018	JOB	028	006	Her stones are the place of sapphires, And she hath clods of gold for man.
018	JOB	028	007	The path thereto no bird knoweth, And the vulture's eye hath not seen it;
018	JOB	028	008	The fierce wild beast hath not trodden it; The lion hath not passed over it.
018	JOB	028	009	Man layeth his hand upon the rock; He upturneth mountains from their roots;
018	JOB	028	010	He cleaveth out streams in the rocks, And his eye seeth every precious thing;
018	JOB	028	011	He bindeth up the streams, that they trickle not, And bringeth hidden things to light.
018	JOB	028	012	But where shall wisdom be found? And where is the place of understanding?
018	JOB	028	013	Man knoweth not the price thereof, Nor can it be found in the land of the living.
018	JOB	028	014	The deep saith, It is not in me; And the sea saith, It is not with me.
018	JOB	028	015	It cannot be gotten for gold, Nor shall silver be weighed out as the price thereof.
018	JOB	028	016	It cannot be bought with the gold of Ophir, With the precious onyx or the sapphire.
018	JOB	028	017	Gold and crystal are not to be compared with it; Nor can it be purchased with jewels of fine gold.
018	JOB	028	018	No mention shall be made of coral or of crystal; For wisdom is more precious than pearls.
018	JOB	028	019	The topaz of Ethiopia cannot equal it, Nor can it be purchased with pure gold.
018	JOB	028	020	Whence then cometh wisdom? And where is the place of understanding?
018	JOB	028	021	Since it is hidden from the eyes of all living, And kept close from the fowls of the air.
018	JOB	028	022	Destruction and Death say, We have heard a rumor of it with our ears.
018	JOB	028	023	God knoweth the way to it; He knoweth its dwelling-place.
018	JOB	028	024	For he seeth to the ends of the earth, And surveyeth all things under the whole heaven.
018	JOB	028	025	When he gave the winds their weight, And meted out the waters by measure;
018	JOB	028	026	When he prescribed a law to the rain, And a path to the thunder-flash, —
018	JOB	028	027	Then did he see it, and make it known; He established it, and searched it out.
018	JOB	028	028	But he said unto man, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom, And to depart from evil is understanding.
018	JOB	029	001	Moreover Job continued his discourse, and said:
018	JOB	029	002	O that I were as in months past, In the days when God was my guardian;
018	JOB	029	003	When his lamp shined over my head, And when by his light I walked through darkness!
018	JOB	029	004	As I was in the autumn of my days, When the friendship of God was over my tent;
018	JOB	029	005	When the Almighty was yet with me, And my children were around me;
018	JOB	029	006	When I bathed my steps in milk, And the rock poured me out rivers of oil!
018	JOB	029	007	When I went forth to the gate by the city, And took my seat in the market-place,
018	JOB	029	008	The young men saw me and hid themselves, And the aged arose and stood.
018	JOB	029	009	The princes refrained from speaking, And laid their hand upon their mouth.
018	JOB	029	010	The nobles held their peace, And their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth.
018	JOB	029	011	When the ear heard me, then it blessed me; And when the eye saw me, it gave witness to me.
018	JOB	029	012	For I delivered the poor, when they cried; And the fatherless, who had none to help him.
018	JOB	029	013	The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me, And I caused the heart of the widow to sing for joy.
018	JOB	029	014	I clothed myself with righteousness, and it clothed itself with me; And justice was my robe and diadem.
018	JOB	029	015	I was eyes to the blind, And feet was I to the lame;
018	JOB	029	016	I was a father to the poor, And the cause of him I knew not I searched out;
018	JOB	029	017	And I broke the teeth of the wicked, And plucked the spoil from his jaws.
018	JOB	029	018	Then said I, “I shall die in my nest; I shall multiply my days as the sand.
018	JOB	029	019	My root is spread abroad to the waters, And the dew abideth on my branches.
018	JOB	029	020	My glory is fresh with me, And my bow gathereth strength in my hand.”
018	JOB	029	021	To me men gave ear, and waited, And kept silence for my counsel.
018	JOB	029	022	To my words they made no reply, When my speech dropped down upon them.
018	JOB	029	023	Yea, they waited for me as for the rain; They opened their mouths wide as for the latter rain.
018	JOB	029	024	If I smiled upon them, they believed it not; Nor did they cause the light of my countenance to fall.
018	JOB	029	025	When I came among them, I sat as chief; I dwelt as a king in the midst of an army, As a comforter among mourners.
018	JOB	030	001	But now they that are younger than I hold me in derision, Whose fathers I would have disdained to set with the dogs of my flock.
018	JOB	030	002	Of what use to me would be even the strength of their hands, To whom old age is lost?
018	JOB	030	003	By want and hunger they are famished; They gnaw the dry desert, The darkness of desolate wastes.
018	JOB	030	004	They gather purslain among the bushes, And the root of the broom is their bread.
018	JOB	030	005	They are driven from the society of men; There is a cry after them as after a thief.
018	JOB	030	006	They dwell in gloomy valleys, In caves of the earth and in rocks.
018	JOB	030	007	They bray among the bushes; Under the brambles are they stretched out.
018	JOB	030	008	An impious and low-born race, They are beaten out of the land.
018	JOB	030	009	And now I am become their song; Yea, I am their by-word!
018	JOB	030	010	They abhor me, they stand aloof from me; They forbear not to spit before my face.
018	JOB	030	011	Yea, they let loose the reins, and humble me; They cast off the bridle before me.
018	JOB	030	012	On my right hand riseth up the brood; They thrust away my feet; They cast up against me their destructive ways.
018	JOB	030	013	They break up my path; They hasten my fall, —They who have no helper!
018	JOB	030	014	They come upon me as through a wide breach; Through the ruins they rush in upon me.
018	JOB	030	015	Terrors are turned against me; They pursue my prosperity like the wind, And my welfare passeth away like a cloud.
018	JOB	030	016	And now my soul poureth itself out upon me; Days of affliction have taken hold of me.
018	JOB	030	017	By night my bones are pierced; they are torn from me, And my gnawers take no rest.
018	JOB	030	018	Through the violence of my disease is my garment changed; It bindeth me about like the collar of my tunic.
018	JOB	030	019	He hath cast me into the mire, And I am become like dust and ashes.
018	JOB	030	020	I call upon Thee, but thou dost not hear me; I stand up before thee, but thou regardest me not.
018	JOB	030	021	Thou art become cruel to me; With thy strong hand dost thou lie in wait for me.
018	JOB	030	022	Thou liftest me up, and causest me to ride upon the wind; Thou meltest me away in the storm.
018	JOB	030	023	I know that thou wilt bring me to death, To the place of assembly for all the living.
018	JOB	030	024	When He stretcheth out his hand, prayer availeth nothing; When He bringeth destruction, vain is the cry for help.
018	JOB	030	025	Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? Was not my soul grieved for the poor?
018	JOB	030	026	But when I looked for good, then evil came; When I looked for light, then came darkness.
018	JOB	030	027	My bowels boil, and have no rest; Days of anguish have come upon me.
018	JOB	030	028	I am black, but not by the sun; I stand up, and utter my cries in the congregation.
018	JOB	030	029	I am become a brother to jackals, And a companion to ostriches.
018	JOB	030	030	My skin is black, and falleth from me, And my bones burn with heat.
018	JOB	030	031	My harp also is turned to mourning, And my pipe to notes of grief.
018	JOB	031	001	I made a covenant with mine eyes; How then could I gaze upon a maid?
018	JOB	031	002	For what is the portion appointed by God from above, And the inheritance allotted by the Almighty from on high?
018	JOB	031	003	Is not destruction for the wicked, And ruin for the workers of iniquity?
018	JOB	031	004	Doth He not see my ways, And number all my steps?
018	JOB	031	005	If I have walked with falsehood, And if my foot hath hasted to deceit,
018	JOB	031	006	Let him weigh me in an even balance; Yea, let God know my integrity!
018	JOB	031	007	If my steps have turned aside from the way, And my heart gone after mine eyes, Or if any stain hath cleaved to my hand,
018	JOB	031	008	Then I may sow, and another eat; And what I plant, may it be rooted up!
018	JOB	031	009	If my heart hath been enticed by a woman, Or if I have watched at my neighbor's door,
018	JOB	031	010	Then let my wife grind for another, And let other men lie with her!
018	JOB	031	011	For this were a heinous crime, Even a transgression to be punished by the judges;
018	JOB	031	012	Yea, it were a fire that would consume to destruction, And root out all my increase.
018	JOB	031	013	If I have refused justice to my man-servant or maid-servant, When they had a controversy with me,
018	JOB	031	014	Then what shall I do when God riseth up? And when he visiteth, what shall I answer him?
018	JOB	031	015	Did not He that made me in the womb make him? Did not one fashion us in the womb?
018	JOB	031	016	If I have refused the poor their desire, And caused the eyes of the widow to fail;
018	JOB	031	017	If I have eaten my morsel alone, And the fatherless hath not partaken of it;
018	JOB	031	018	(Nay, from my youth he grew up with me as with a father, And I have helped the widow from my mother's womb; )
018	JOB	031	019	If I have seen any one perishing for want of clothing, Or any poor man without covering;
018	JOB	031	020	If his loins have not blessed me, And he hath not been warmed with the fleece of my sheep;
018	JOB	031	021	If I have shaken my hand against the fatherless, Because I saw my help in the gate, —
018	JOB	031	022	Then may my shoulder fill from its blade, And my fore-arm be broken from its bone!
018	JOB	031	023	For destruction from God was a terror to me, And before his majesty I could do nothing.
018	JOB	031	024	If I have made gold my trust, Or said to the fine gold, Thou art my confidence;
018	JOB	031	025	If I have rejoiced, because my wealth was great, And my hand had found abundance;
018	JOB	031	026	If I have beheld the sun in his splendor, Or the moon advancing in brightness,
018	JOB	031	027	And my heart hath been secretly enticed, And my mouth hath kissed my hand,
018	JOB	031	028	This also were a crime to be punished by the judge; For I should have denied the God who is above.
018	JOB	031	029	If I have rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me, And exulted when evil came upon him;
018	JOB	031	030	(Nay, I have not suffered my mouth to sin, By asking with curses his life; )
018	JOB	031	031	If the men of my tent have not exclaimed, “Who is there that hath not been satisfied with his meat?”
018	JOB	031	032	The stranger did not lodge in the street; I opened my doors to the traveller.
018	JOB	031	033	Have I, after the manner of men, hidden my transgression, Concealing my iniquity in my bosom,
018	JOB	031	034	Then let me be confounded before the great multitude! Let the contempt of families cover me with shame! Yea, let me keep silence! let me never appear abroad!
018	JOB	031	035	O that there were one who would hear me! Behold my signature! let the Almighty answer me. And let mine adversary write down his charge!
018	JOB	031	036	Truly I would wear it upon my shoulder; I would bind it upon me as a crown.
018	JOB	031	037	I would disclose to him all my steps; I would approach him like a prince.
018	JOB	031	038	If my land cry out against me, And its furrows bewail together;
018	JOB	031	039	If I have eaten of its fruits without payment, And wrung out the life of its owners,
018	JOB	031	040	Let thorns grow up instead of wheat, And noxious weeds instead of barley. The words of Job are ended.
018	JOB	032	001	So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.
018	JOB	032	002	Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu, the son of Barachel, the Buzite, of the family of Ram; against Job was his wrath kindled, because he accounted himself righteous rather than God.
018	JOB	032	003	Against his three friends also was his wrath kindled, because they had not found an answer, and yet had condemned Job.
018	JOB	032	004	Now Elihu had delayed to reply to Job, because they were older than himself.
018	JOB	032	005	But when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, his wrath was kindled.
018	JOB	032	006	Then spake Elihu, the son of Barachel, the Buzite, and said: I am young, and ye are very old; Therefore I was afraid, And durst not make known to you my opinion.
018	JOB	032	007	I said, “Days should speak, And the multitude of years should teach wisdom.”
018	JOB	032	008	But it is the spirit in man, Even the inspiration of the Almighty, that giveth him understanding.
018	JOB	032	009	Great men are not always wise, Nor do the aged always understand what is right.
018	JOB	032	010	Therefore, I pray, listen to me: I also will declare my opinion.
018	JOB	032	011	Behold, I have waited for your words, I have listened to your arguments, Whilst ye searched out what to say;
018	JOB	032	012	Yea, I have attended to you; And behold, none of you hath refuted Job, Nor answered his words.
018	JOB	032	013	Say not, then, “We have found out wisdom; God must conquer him, not man.”
018	JOB	032	014	He hath not directed his discourse against me, And with speeches like yours will I not answer him.
018	JOB	032	015	They were confounded! they answered no more! They could say nothing!
018	JOB	032	016	I waited, but they spake not; They stood still; they answered no more!
018	JOB	032	017	Therefore will I answer, on my part; I also will show my opinion.
018	JOB	032	018	For I am full of matter; The spirit within me constraineth me.
018	JOB	032	019	Behold, my bosom is as wine that hath no vent; Like bottles of new wine, which are bursting.
018	JOB	032	020	I will speak, that I may be relieved; I will open my lips and answer.
018	JOB	032	021	I will not be partial to any man's person, Nor will I flatter any man.
018	JOB	032	022	For I know not how to flatter; Soon would my Maker take me away.
018	JOB	033	001	Hear, therefore, my discourse, I pray thee, O Job! And attend unto all my words!
018	JOB	033	002	Behold, I am opening my mouth; My tongue is now speaking in my palate.
018	JOB	033	003	My words shall be in the uprightness of my heart; My lips shall utter knowledge purely.
018	JOB	033	004	The spirit of God made me, And the breath of the Almighty gave me life.
018	JOB	033	005	If thou art able, answer me; Set thyself in array against me; stand up!
018	JOB	033	006	Behold, I, like thee, am a creature of God; I also was formed of clay.
018	JOB	033	007	Behold, my terror cannot dismay thee, Nor can my greatness be heavy upon thee.
018	JOB	033	008	Surely thou hast said in my hearing, I have heard the sound of thy words:
018	JOB	033	009	“I am pure, and without transgression; I am clean, and there is no iniquity in me.
018	JOB	033	010	Behold, He seeketh causes of hostility against me; He regardeth me as his enemy.
018	JOB	033	011	He putteth my feet in the stocks; He watcheth all my paths.”
018	JOB	033	012	Behold, in this thou art not right; I will answer thee; For God is greater than man.
018	JOB	033	013	Why dost thou contend with Him? For he giveth no account of any of his doings.
018	JOB	033	014	For God speaketh once, Yea, twice, when man regardeth it not.
018	JOB	033	015	In a dream, in a vision of the night, When deep sleep falleth upon men, In slumber upon the bed;
018	JOB	033	016	Then openeth he the ears of men, And sealeth up for them admonition;
018	JOB	033	017	That he may turn man from his purpose, And hide pride from man.
018	JOB	033	018	Thus he saveth him from the pit, Yea, his life from perishing by the sword.
018	JOB	033	019	He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, And with a continual agitation of his bones,
018	JOB	033	020	So that his mouth abhorreth bread, And his taste the choicest food;
018	JOB	033	021	His flesh is consumed, that it cannot be seen, And his bones, that were invisible, are naked;
018	JOB	033	022	Yea, his soul draweth near to the pit, And his life to the destroyers.
018	JOB	033	023	But if there be with him a messenger, An interpreter, one of a thousand, Who may show unto man his duty,
018	JOB	033	024	Then will God be gracious to him, and say, “Save him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom.”
018	JOB	033	025	His flesh shall became fresher than a child's; He shall return to the days of his youth.
018	JOB	033	026	He shall pray to God, and he will be favorable to him, And permit him to see his face with joy, And restore unto man his righteousness.
018	JOB	033	027	He shall sing among men, and say, “I sinned; I acted perversely; Yet hath he not requited me for it:
018	JOB	033	028	He hath delivered me from going down to the pit, And my life beholdeth the light.”
018	JOB	033	029	Lo! all these things doeth God Time after time with man,
018	JOB	033	030	That he may bring him back from the pit, That he may enjoy the light of the living.
018	JOB	033	031	Mark well, O Job! hearken to me! Keep silence, and I will speak.
018	JOB	033	032	Yet if thou hast any thing to say, answer me! Speak! for I desire to pronounce thee innocent.
018	JOB	033	033	But if not, do thou listen to me! Keep silence, and I will teach thee wisdom!
018	JOB	034	001	And Elihu proceeded, and said:
018	JOB	034	002	Hear my words, ye wise men! Give ear to me, ye that have knowledge!
018	JOB	034	003	For the ear trieth words, As the mouth tasteth meat.
018	JOB	034	004	Let us examine for ourselves what is right; Let us know among ourselves what is true.
018	JOB	034	005	Job hath said, “I am righteous, And God refuseth me justice.
018	JOB	034	006	Though I am innocent, I am made a liar; My wound is incurable, though I am free from transgression.”
018	JOB	034	007	Where is the man like Job, Who drinketh impiety like water;
018	JOB	034	008	Who goeth in company with evil-doers, And walketh with wicked men?
018	JOB	034	009	For he hath said, “A man hath no advantage, When he delighteth himself in God.”
018	JOB	034	010	Wherefore hearken to me, ye men of understanding! Far be iniquity from God; Yea, far be injustice from the Almighty!
018	JOB	034	011	For what a man hath done he will requite him, And render to every one according to his deeds.
018	JOB	034	012	Surely God will not do iniquity, Nor will the Almighty pervert justice.
018	JOB	034	013	Who hath given him the charge of the earth? Or who hath created the whole world?
018	JOB	034	014	Should he set his heart against man, Should he take back his spirit and his breath,
018	JOB	034	015	Then would all flesh expire together; Yea, man would return to the dust.
018	JOB	034	016	If thou hast understanding, hear this! Give ear to the voice of my words!
018	JOB	034	017	Shall he, that hateth justice, govern? Wilt thou then condemn the just and mighty One?
018	JOB	034	018	Is it fit to say to a king, Thou art wicked; Or to princes, Ye are unrighteous?
018	JOB	034	019	How much less to him that is not partial to princes, Nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? For they are all the work of his hands.
018	JOB	034	020	In a moment they die; yea, at midnight Do the people stagger and pass away, And the mighty are destroyed without hand.
018	JOB	034	021	For his eyes are upon the ways of man; He seeth all his steps.
018	JOB	034	022	There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, Where evil-doers may hide themselves.
018	JOB	034	023	He needeth not attend long to a man, That he may go into judgment before God;
018	JOB	034	024	He dasheth in pieces the mighty without inquiry, And setteth up others in their stead.
018	JOB	034	025	Therefore he knoweth their works, And in a night he overthroweth them, so that they are destroyed.
018	JOB	034	026	On account of their wickedness he smiteth them, In the presence of many beholders;
018	JOB	034	027	Because they turned away from him, And had no regard to his ways,
018	JOB	034	028	And caused the cry of the poor to come before him; For he heareth the cry of the oppressed.
018	JOB	034	029	When he giveth rest, who can cause trouble? And when he hideth his face, Who can behold him?
018	JOB	034	030	So is it with nations and individuals alike! That the wicked may no more rule, And may not be snares to the people.
018	JOB	034	031	Surely thou shouldst say unto God, “I have received chastisement; I will no more offend;
018	JOB	034	032	What I see not, teach thou me! If I have done iniquity, I will do it no more.”
018	JOB	034	033	Shall he recompense according to thy mind, Because thou refusest, or because thou choosest, and not he? Speak, if thou hast knowledge!
018	JOB	034	034	Men of understanding, Wise men, who hear me, will say,
018	JOB	034	035	“Job hath spoken without knowledge, And his words are without wisdom.”
018	JOB	034	036	I desire that Job may be tried to the last, For answering like wicked men.
018	JOB	034	037	For he addeth impiety to his sin; He clappeth his hands among us, And multiplieth words against God.
018	JOB	035	001	Moreover Elihu proceeded, and said:
018	JOB	035	002	Dost thou then think this to be right? Thou hast said, “I am more righteous than God.”
018	JOB	035	003	For thou askest, “What advantage have I? What have I gained, more than if I had sinned?”
018	JOB	035	004	I will answer thee, And thy companions with thee.
018	JOB	035	005	Look up to the heavens, and see! And behold the clouds, which are high above thee!
018	JOB	035	006	If thou sinnest, what doest thou against Him? If thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou to him?
018	JOB	035	007	If thou art righteous, what dost thou give him? Or what receiveth he at thy hand?
018	JOB	035	008	Thy wickedness injureth only a man like thyself, And thy righteousness profiteth only a son of man.
018	JOB	035	009	The oppressed cry out on account of the multitude of wrongs; They cry aloud on account of the arm of the mighty.
018	JOB	035	010	But none saith, “Where is God, my Maker, Who giveth songs in the night;
018	JOB	035	011	Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, And maketh us wiser than the birds of heaven?”
018	JOB	035	012	There they cry aloud on account of the pride of the wicked; But he giveth no answer.
018	JOB	035	013	For God will not hear the vain supplication, Nor will the Almighty regard it;
018	JOB	035	014	Much less when thou sayest thou canst not see him: Justice is with him, —only wait thou for him!
018	JOB	035	015	But now, because he hath not visited in his anger, Nor taken strict note of transgression,
018	JOB	035	016	Therefore hath Job opened his mouth rashly, And multiplied words without knowledge.
018	JOB	036	001	Elihu also proceeded, and said:
018	JOB	036	002	Bear with me a little while, that I may show thee! For I have yet words in behalf of God.
018	JOB	036	003	I will bring my knowledge from afar, And assert the justice of my Maker.
018	JOB	036	004	Truly my words shall not be false: A man of sound knowledge is before thee.
018	JOB	036	005	Behold, God is great, but despiseth not any; Great is he in strength of understanding.
018	JOB	036	006	He suffereth not the wicked to prosper, But rendereth justice to the oppressed.
018	JOB	036	007	He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous; But establisheth them for ever with kings on the throne, That they may be exalted.
018	JOB	036	008	And if they be bound in fetters, And holden in the cords of affliction,
018	JOB	036	009	Then showeth he them their deeds, And how they have set him at defiance by their transgressions;
018	JOB	036	010	He also openeth their ears to admonition, And commandeth them to return from iniquity.
018	JOB	036	011	If they obey and serve him, They spend their days in prosperity, And their years in pleasures.
018	JOB	036	012	But if they obey not, they perish by the sword; They die in their own folly.
018	JOB	036	013	The corrupt in heart treasure up wrath; They cry not to God, when he bindeth them.
018	JOB	036	014	They die in their youth; They close their lives with the unclean.
018	JOB	036	015	But he delivereth the poor in their distress; He openeth their ears in affliction.
018	JOB	036	016	He will bring thee also from the jaws of distress To a broad place, where is no straitness; And the provision of thy table shall be full of fatness.
018	JOB	036	017	But if thou art full of the judgment of the wicked, Judgment and justice shall take hold of thee.
018	JOB	036	018	For if wrath be with him, beware lest he take thee away by his stroke, So that a great ransom shall not save thee!
018	JOB	036	019	Will he esteem thy riches? No! neither thy gold, nor all the abundance of thy wealth.
018	JOB	036	020	Long not thou for that night To which nations are taken away from their place.
018	JOB	036	021	Take heed, turn not thine eyes to iniquity! For this hast thou chosen rather than affliction.
018	JOB	036	022	Behold, God is exalted in his power: Who is a teacher like him?
018	JOB	036	023	Who hath prescribed to him his way? Or who can say to him, “Thou hast done wrong”?
018	JOB	036	024	Forget not to magnify his work, Which men celebrate with songs.
018	JOB	036	025	All mankind gaze upon it; Mortals behold it from afar.
018	JOB	036	026	Behold, God is great; we cannot know him, Nor search out the number of his years.
018	JOB	036	027	Lo! he draweth up the drops of water, Which distil rain from his vapor;
018	JOB	036	028	The clouds pour it down, And drop it upon man in abundance.
018	JOB	036	029	Who can understand the spreading of his clouds, And the rattling of his pavilion?
018	JOB	036	030	Behold, he spreadeth around himself his light, And he clotheth himself with the depths of the sea.
018	JOB	036	031	By these he punisheth nations, And by these he giveth food in abundance.
018	JOB	036	032	His hands he covereth with lightning; He giveth it commandment against an enemy.
018	JOB	036	033	His thunder maketh him known; Yea, to the herds, as he ascendeth on high.
018	JOB	037	001	At this my heart trembleth, And leapeth out of its place.
018	JOB	037	002	Hear, O hear, the thunder of his voice, And the noise which goeth forth from his mouth!
018	JOB	037	003	He directeth it under the whole heaven, And his lightning to the ends of the earth.
018	JOB	037	004	After it the thunder roareth; He thundereth with his voice of majesty, And restraineth it not, when his voice is heard.
018	JOB	037	005	God thundereth with his voice marvellously; Great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend.
018	JOB	037	006	For he saith to the snow, “Be thou on the earth!” To the shower also, even the showers of his might.
018	JOB	037	007	He sealeth up the hand of every man, That all men whom he hath made may acknowledge him.
018	JOB	037	008	Then the beasts go into dens, And abide in their caverns.
018	JOB	037	009	Out of the south cometh the whirlwind, And cold out of the north.
018	JOB	037	010	By the breath of God ice is formed, And the broad waters become narrow,
018	JOB	037	011	Yea, with moisture he burdeneth the clouds; He spreadeth abroad his lightning-clouds.
018	JOB	037	012	They move about by his direction, To execute all his commands throughout the world;
018	JOB	037	013	Whether he cause them to come for punishment, Or for the land, or for mercy.
018	JOB	037	014	Give ear to this, O Job! Stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God!
018	JOB	037	015	Dost thou know when God gave commandment to them, And caused the lightning of his cloud to flash?
018	JOB	037	016	Dost thou understand the balancing of the clouds, The wondrous works of Him that is perfect in knowledge?
018	JOB	037	017	How thy garments become warm, When he maketh the earth still by the south wind?
018	JOB	037	018	Canst thou like him spread out the sky, Which is firm like a molten mirror?
018	JOB	037	019	Teach us what we shall say to him! For we cannot set in order our words by reason of darkness.
018	JOB	037	020	Shall it be told him that I would speak? Shall a man speak, that he may be consumed?
018	JOB	037	021	For now men do not look upon the light, When it is bright in the skies, When the wind hath passed over them, and made them clear.
018	JOB	037	022	From the north cometh gold; But with God is terrible majesty!
018	JOB	037	023	The Almighty, we cannot find him out; Great is he in power and justice, Abundant in righteousness; he doth not oppress.
018	JOB	037	024	Therefore let men fear him! Upon none of the wise in heart will he look.
018	JOB	038	001	Then spake Jehovah to Job out of the whirlwind, and said:
018	JOB	038	002	Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?
018	JOB	038	003	Gird up thy loins like a man! I will ask thee, and answer thou me!
018	JOB	038	004	Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? Declare, if thou hast understanding!
018	JOB	038	005	Who fixed its dimensions, that thou shouldst know it! Or who stretched out the line upon it?
018	JOB	038	006	Upon what were its foundations fixed? And who laid its corner-stone,
018	JOB	038	007	When the morning stars sang together, And all the sons of God shouted for joy?
018	JOB	038	008	And who shut up the sea with doors, When it burst forth as from the womb?
018	JOB	038	009	When I made the clouds its mantle, And thick darkness its swaddling-band;
018	JOB	038	010	When I appointed for it my bound, And fixed for it bars and doors;
018	JOB	038	011	And said, Thus far shalt thou come, and no farther, And here shall thy proud waves be stayed!
018	JOB	038	012	Hast thou, in thy life, given charge to the morning, Or caused the day-spring to know its place,
018	JOB	038	013	That it should lay hold of the ends of the earth, And shake the wicked out of it?
018	JOB	038	014	It is changed as clay by the seal; And all things stand forth as in rich apparel.
018	JOB	038	015	But from the wicked their light is withheld, And the high-raised arm is broken.
018	JOB	038	016	Hast thou visited the springs of the sea, And walked through the recesses of the deep?
018	JOB	038	017	Have the gates of death been disclosed to thee, And hast thou seen the gates of the shadow of death?
018	JOB	038	018	Hast thou surveyed the breadth of the earth? Declare, if thou knowest it all!
018	JOB	038	019	Where is the way to the abode of light? And darkness—where is its dwelling-place?
018	JOB	038	020	That thou shouldst lead it to its boundary, And that thou shouldst know the paths to its mansion!
018	JOB	038	021	Surely thou knowest; for thou wast then born! And the number of thy years is great!
018	JOB	038	022	Hast thou visited the storehouses of the snow, Or seen the treasuries of the hail,
018	JOB	038	023	Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, —Against the day of battle and war?
018	JOB	038	024	What is the way to where light is distributed, And the east wind spread abroad upon the earth?
018	JOB	038	025	Who hath prepared channels for the rain, And a path for the thunder-flash,
018	JOB	038	026	To give rain to the land without an inhabitant, To the wilderness wherein is no man;
018	JOB	038	027	To satisfy the desolate and waste ground, And cause the tender herb to spring forth?
018	JOB	038	028	Hath the rain a father? Or who hath begotten the drops of the dew?
018	JOB	038	029	Out of whose womb came the ice? And who hath gendered the hoar-frost of heaven?
018	JOB	038	030	The waters are hid as under stone, And the face of the deep becometh solid.
018	JOB	038	031	Canst thou fasten the bands of the Pleiades, Or loosen the chains of Orion?
018	JOB	038	032	Canst thou lead forth the Signs in their season, Or guide the Bear with her sons?
018	JOB	038	033	Knowest thou the ordinances of the heavens? Hast thou appointed their dominion over the earth?
018	JOB	038	034	Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, So that abundance of waters will cover thee?
018	JOB	038	035	Canst thou send forth lightnings, so that they will go, And say to thee, “Here we are”?
018	JOB	038	036	Who hath put understanding in the reins, And given intelligence to the mind?
018	JOB	038	037	Who numbereth the clouds in wisdom? And who poureth out the bottles of heaven,
018	JOB	038	038	When the dust floweth into a molten mass, And the clods cleave fast together?
018	JOB	038	039	Canst thou hunt prey for the lioness, Or satisfy the hunger of the young lions,
018	JOB	038	040	When they couch in their dens, And lie in wait in the thicket?
018	JOB	038	041	Who provideth for the raven his food, When his young ones cry unto God, While they wander about without food?
018	JOB	039	001	Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth? Or canst thou observe when the hinds are in labor?
018	JOB	039	002	Canst thou number the months they fulfill, And know the season when they bring forth?
018	JOB	039	003	They bow themselves; they bring forth their young; They cast forth their pains.
018	JOB	039	004	Their young ones are strong; they grow up in the fields; They go away, and return not to them.
018	JOB	039	005	Who hath sent forth the wild ass free? Who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass,
018	JOB	039	006	To whom I have given the wilderness for his house, And the barren land for his dwelling-place?
018	JOB	039	007	He scorneth the tumult of the city, And heedeth not the shouting of the driver;
018	JOB	039	008	The range of the mountains is his pasture; He seeketh after every green thing,
018	JOB	039	009	Will the wild-ox consent to serve thee? Will he pass the night at thy crib?
018	JOB	039	010	Canst thou bind the wild-ox with the harness to the furrow? Or will he harrow the valleys after thee?
018	JOB	039	011	Wilt thou rely upon him because his strength is great, And commit to him thy labor?
018	JOB	039	012	Wilt thou trust him to bring home thy grain, And gather in thy harvest?
018	JOB	039	013	The wing of the ostrich moveth joyfully; But is it with loving pinion and feathers?
018	JOB	039	014	Nay, she layeth her eggs on the ground; She warmeth them in the dust,
018	JOB	039	015	And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, And that the wild beast may break them.
018	JOB	039	016	She is cruel to her young, as if they were not hers; Her labor is in vain, yet she feareth not;
018	JOB	039	017	Because God hath denied her wisdom, And hath not given her understanding.
018	JOB	039	018	Yet when she lasheth herself up on high, She laugheth at the horse and his rider.
018	JOB	039	019	Hast thou given the horse strength? Hast thou clothed his neck with his trembling mane?
018	JOB	039	020	Hast thou taught him to bound like the locust? How majestic his snorting! how terrible!
018	JOB	039	021	He paweth in the valley; he exulteth in his strength, And rusheth into the midst of arms.
018	JOB	039	022	He laugheth at fear; he trembleth not, And turneth not back from the sword.
018	JOB	039	023	Against him rattle the quiver, The flaming spear, and the lance.
018	JOB	039	024	With rage and fury he devoureth the ground; He will not believe that the trumpet soundeth.
018	JOB	039	025	At every blast of the trumpet, he saith, Aha! And snuffeth the battle afar off, —The thunder of the captains, and the war-shout.
018	JOB	039	026	Is it by thy wisdom that the hawk flieth, And spreadeth his wings toward the south?
018	JOB	039	027	Doth the eagle soar at thy command, And build his nest on high?
018	JOB	039	028	He dwelleth and lodgeth upon the rock, Upon the peak of the rock, and the stronghold.
018	JOB	039	029	From thence he spieth out prey; His eyes discern it from afar.
018	JOB	039	030	His young ones suck up blood; And where the slain are, there is he.
018	JOB	040	001	Moreover Jehovah spake to Job, and said:
018	JOB	040	002	Will the censurer of the Almighty contend with him? Will the reprover of God answer?
018	JOB	040	003	Then Job answered Jehovah, and said:
018	JOB	040	004	Behold, I am vile! what can I answer thee? I will lay my hand upon my mouth.
018	JOB	040	005	Once have I spoken, but I will not speak again; Yea, twice, but I will say no more.
018	JOB	040	006	Then spake Jehovah to Job out of the whirlwind, and said:
018	JOB	040	007	Gird up now thy loins like a man! I will ask thee, and do thou instruct me!
018	JOB	040	008	Wilt thou even disannul my right? Wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayst be righteous?
018	JOB	040	009	Hast thou an arm like God's? Or canst thou thunder with thy voice like him?
018	JOB	040	010	Deck thyself with grandeur and majesty, And array thyself in splendor and glory!
018	JOB	040	011	Send forth the fury of thy wrath! Look upon every proud one, and abase him!
018	JOB	040	012	Look upon every proud one, and bring him low; Yea, tread down the wicked in their place!
018	JOB	040	013	Hide them in the dust together; Shut up their faces in darkness!
018	JOB	040	014	Then, indeed, will I give thee the praise, That thine own right hand can save thee.
018	JOB	040	015	Behold the river-horse, which I have made as well as thyself; He feedeth on grass like the ox.
018	JOB	040	016	Behold, what strength is in his loins! And what force in the muscles of his belly!
018	JOB	040	017	He bendeth his tail, like the cedar, And the sinews of his thighs are twisted together.
018	JOB	040	018	His bones are pipes of brass, And his limbs are bars of iron.
018	JOB	040	019	He is chief among the works of God; He that made him gave him his sword.
018	JOB	040	020	For the mountains supply him with food, Where all the beasts of the field play.
018	JOB	040	021	He lieth down under the lote-plants, In the covert of reeds, and in the fens.
018	JOB	040	022	The lote-plants cover him with their shadow, And the willows of the brook compass him about.
018	JOB	040	023	Lo! the stream overfloweth, but he starteth not; He is unmoved though Jordan rush forth even to his mouth.
018	JOB	040	024	Can one take him before his eyes, Or pierce his nose with hooks?
018	JOB	041	001	Canst thou draw forth the crocodile with a hook, Or press down his tongue with a cord?
018	JOB	041	002	Canst thou put a rope into his nose, Or pierce his cheek with a hook?
018	JOB	041	003	Will he make many entreaties to thee? Will he speak soft words to thee?
018	JOB	041	004	Will he make a covenant with thee? Canst thou take him for a servant for ever?
018	JOB	041	005	Canst thou play with him, as with a bird? Or canst thou bind him for thy maidens?
018	JOB	041	006	Do men in company lay snares for him? Do they divide him among the merchants?
018	JOB	041	007	Canst thou fill his skirt with barbed irons, Or his head with fish-spears?
018	JOB	041	008	Do but lay thy hand upon him, —Thou wilt no more think of battle!
018	JOB	041	009	Behold, his hope is vain! Is he not cast down at the very sight of him?
018	JOB	041	010	None is so fierce that he dare stir him up; Who then is he that can stand before me?
018	JOB	041	011	Who hath done me a favor, that I must repay him? Whatever is under the whole heaven is mine.
018	JOB	041	012	I will not be silent concerning his limbs, And his strength, and the beauty of his armor.
018	JOB	041	013	Who can uncover the surface of his garment? Who will approach his jaws?
018	JOB	041	014	Who will open the doors of his face? The rows of his teeth are terrible!
018	JOB	041	015	His glory is his strong shields, United with each other, as with a close seal.
018	JOB	041	016	They are joined one to another, So that no air can come between them.
018	JOB	041	017	They cleave fast to each other, They hold together, and cannot be separated.
018	JOB	041	018	His sneezing sendeth forth light, And his eyes are like the eyelashes of the morning.
018	JOB	041	019	Out of his mouth go flames, And sparks of fire leap forth.
018	JOB	041	020	From his nostrils issueth smoke, as from a heated pot, or caldron.
018	JOB	041	021	His breath kindleth coals, And flames issue from his mouth.
018	JOB	041	022	In his neck dwelleth strength, And terror danceth before him.
018	JOB	041	023	The flakes of his flesh cleave fast together; They are firm upon him, and cannot be moved.
018	JOB	041	024	His heart is solid like a stone; Yea, solid like the nether millstone.
018	JOB	041	025	When he riseth up, the mighty are afraid; Yea, they lose themselves for terror.
018	JOB	041	026	The sword of him that assaileth him doth not stand, The spear, the dart, nor the habergeon.
018	JOB	041	027	He regardeth iron as straw, And brass as rotten wood.
018	JOB	041	028	The arrow cannot make him flee; Sling-stones to him become stubble;
018	JOB	041	029	Clubs are accounted by him as straw; He laugheth at the shaking of the spear.
018	JOB	041	030	Under him are sharp potsherds; He spreadeth out a thrashing-sledge upon the mire.
018	JOB	041	031	He maketh the deep to boil like a caldron; He maketh the sea like a pot of ointment.
018	JOB	041	032	Behind him he leaveth a shining path; One would think the deep to be hoary.
018	JOB	041	033	Upon the earth there is not his master; He is made without fear.
018	JOB	041	034	He looketh down upon all that is high; He is king over all the sons of pride.
018	JOB	042	001	Then Job answered Jehovah, and said:
018	JOB	042	002	I know that thou canst do every thing, And that no purpose of thine can be hindered.
018	JOB	042	003	Who is he that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge? Thus have I uttered what I understood not; Things too wonderful for me, which I knew not:
018	JOB	042	004	Hear thou, then, I beseech thee, and I will speak! I will ask thee, and do thou instruct me!
018	JOB	042	005	I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear; But now hath mine eye seen thee.
018	JOB	042	006	Wherefore I abhor myself, And repent in dust and ashes.
018	JOB	042	007	And when Jehovah had spoken these words unto Job, he said to Eliphaz the Temanite: “My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends; for ye have not spoken concerning me that which is right, as hath my servant Job.
018	JOB	042	008	Take ye, therefore, seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer for yourselves a burnt-offering, and my servant Job shall pray for you; for to him alone will I have regard; that I deal not with you according to your folly. For ye have not spoken concerning me that which is right, as hath my servant Job.”
018	JOB	042	009	So Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite, went and did as Jehovah commanded them; and Jehovah had regard to Job.
018	JOB	042	010	And Jehovah turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends, and Jehovah gave him twice as much as he had before.
018	JOB	042	011	Then came to him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all his former acquaintances, and ate bread with him in his house; and condoled with him, and comforted him over all the evil which Jehovah had brought upon him; and every one gave him a piece of money [[a kesita]], and every one a ring of gold.
018	JOB	042	012	Thus Jehovah blessed the latter end of Job more than the beginning; for he had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she-asses.
018	JOB	042	013	He had also seven sons, and three daughters.
018	JOB	042	014	And he called the name of the first Jemima, of the second Kezia, and of the third Kerenhappuch.
018	JOB	042	015	And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of Job; and their father gave them an inheritance among their brethren.
018	JOB	042	016	And Job lived after this a hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, even four generations.
018	JOB	042	017	Then Job died, being old and satisfied with days.

019	PSA	001	004	Not so the unrighteous; They are like chaff, which the wind driveth away.
019	PSA	001	005	Therefore the wicked shall not stand in judgment, Nor sinners in the assembly of the just.
019	PSA	001	006	For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous, But the way of the wicked leadeth to ruin.
019	PSA	002	001	Why do the heathen rage, And the nations meditate a vain thing?
019	PSA	002	002	Why do the kings of the earth rise up, And the princes combine together, Against Jehovah, and against his anointed king?
019	PSA	002	003	“Let us break their bonds asunder; Let us cast away from us their fetters!”
019	PSA	002	004	He that sitteth in heaven will laugh; The Lord will have them in derision.
019	PSA	002	005	Then shall he speak to them in his wrath, And confound them in his hot displeasure.
019	PSA	002	006	“I myself have anointed my king, Upon Zion, my holy hill!”
019	PSA	002	007	I will declare the decree of Jehovah: He hath said to me, “Thou art my son; This day I have begotten thee.
019	PSA	002	008	Ask of me, and I will give thee the nations for thine inheritance, And the ends of the earth for thy possession.
019	PSA	002	009	Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; Thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.”
019	PSA	002	010	Be wise, therefore, O ye kings! Be admonished, ye rulers of the earth!
019	PSA	002	011	Be subject to Jehovah with awe, And fear with trembling!
019	PSA	002	012	Kiss the son, lest He be angry, and ye perish in your way; For soon shall his wrath be kindled. Happy are all they who seek refuge in him.
019	PSA	003	001	“A Psalm of David, when he fled from his son Absalom.” How many, O LORD, are mine enemies! How many are they who rise up against me!
019	PSA	003	002	How many are they who say of me, “There is no help for him with God”! (Pause)
019	PSA	003	003	But thou, O LORD! art my shield, My glory, and the lifter-up of my head.
019	PSA	003	004	I call upon the LORD with my voice, And he heareth me from his holy hill. (Pause)
019	PSA	003	005	I lay me down and sleep; I awake, for the LORD sustaineth me.
019	PSA	003	006	I will not fear the ten thousands of people Who on every side set themselves against me.
019	PSA	003	007	Arise, O LORD! Save me, O my God! For thou smitest the cheek of all my enemies; Thou breakest the teeth of the wicked.
019	PSA	003	008	Deliverance cometh from the LORD: May thy blessing be with thy people! (Pause)
019	PSA	004	001	“For the leader of the music; to be accompanied with stringed instruments. A psalm of David.” Hear me, when I call, O God of my righteousness! Thou hast helped me, when I was in trouble, —Have pity upon me, and hear my prayer!
019	PSA	004	002	How long, O men! will ye dishonor my dignity? How long will ye love vanity, and seek disappointment? (Pause)
019	PSA	004	003	Know ye that the LORD hath exalted one that is devoted to him; The LORD will hear, when I call upon him.
019	PSA	004	004	Stand in awe, and sin no more; Commune with your hearts upon your beds, and desist! (Pause)
019	PSA	004	005	Offer sacrifices of righteousness, And put your trust in the LORD!
019	PSA	004	006	There are many who say, Who will show us any good? LORD, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us!
019	PSA	004	007	Thou puttest gladness into my heart, Greater than theirs, when their corn and wine are abundant.
019	PSA	004	008	I will lay me down in peace, and sleep: For thou alone, O LORD! makest me dwell in safety.
019	PSA	005	001	“For the leader of the music; to be accompanied with wind instruments. A psalm of David.” Give ear to my words, O LORD; Have regard to my cry!
019	PSA	005	002	Listen to the voice of my supplication, my King and my God! For to thee do I address my prayer.
019	PSA	005	003	In the morning shalt thou hear my voice, O LORD! In the morning will I address my prayer to thee, and look for help.
019	PSA	005	004	For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness; The unrighteous man dwelleth not with thee.
019	PSA	005	005	The haughty shall not stand in thy sight; Thou hatest all that do iniquity.
019	PSA	005	006	Thou destroyest them that speak falsehood; The man of blood and deceit the LORD abhorreth.
019	PSA	005	007	But I, through thy great goodness, will come to thy house; In thy fear will I worship at thy holy temple.
019	PSA	005	008	Lead me, O LORD! in thy righteousness, because of mine enemies; Make thy path straight before my face!
019	PSA	005	009	For in their mouth there is no truth; Their heart is malignity; Their throat is an open sepulchre; They flatter with their tongue.
019	PSA	005	010	Requite them, O God! Let them be confounded in their devices; Cast them out for the multitude of their transgressions; For against thee have they rebelled!
019	PSA	005	011	But let all, that put their trust in thee, rejoice; Let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them; Let them, that love thy name, be joyful in thee!
019	PSA	005	012	For thou, O LORD! dost bless the righteous; With favor dost thou encompass him, as with a shield.
019	PSA	006	001	“For the leader of the music; to be accompanied with stringed instruments; to the octave. A psalm of David.” O LORD! rebuke me not in thine anger; Chasten me not in thy hot displeasure!
019	PSA	006	002	Have pity upon me, O LORD! for I am weak; Heal me, O LORD! for my bones tremble!
019	PSA	006	003	My soul, also, is sore troubled; And thou, O LORD! how long—?
019	PSA	006	004	Return, O LORD! and deliver me; Oh, save me according to thy mercy!
019	PSA	006	005	For in death no praise is given to thee; In the underworld who can give thee thanks?
019	PSA	006	006	I am weary with my groaning; All the night I make my bed to swim, And drench my couch with my tears.
019	PSA	006	007	Mine eye is wasted with grief; It hath become old because of all my enemies.
019	PSA	006	008	Depart from me, all ye that do iniquity; For the LORD heareth the voice of my weeping.
019	PSA	006	009	The LORD heareth my supplication; The LORD accepteth my prayer.
019	PSA	006	010	All my enemies shall be ashamed and utterly confounded; They shall be turned back, and put to shame suddenly.
019	PSA	007	001	“A psalm of David, which he sang to Jehovah, on account of the reproaches of Cush the Benjamite.” O Jehovah, my God! to thee do I look for help; Save me from them that persecute me, and deliver me!
019	PSA	007	002	Lest mine enemy tear me like a lion; Lest he rend me in pieces, while there is none to help.
019	PSA	007	003	O Jehovah, my God! if I have done this, —If there be iniquity upon my hands,
019	PSA	007	004	If I have rendered evil to my friend, Or have despoiled him that without cause is mine enemy, —
019	PSA	007	005	Let my adversary pursue and take me; Let him trample me to the ground, And lay me prostrate in the dust! (Pause)
019	PSA	007	006	Arise, O LORD! in thine anger; Lift thyself up against the rage of mine enemies; Awake for me, ordain judgment!
019	PSA	007	007	Let the assembly of the nations compass thee about, And on their account return to the height!
019	PSA	007	008	The LORD judgeth the nations; Judge me, O LORD! according to my righteousness, And requite me according to my integrity!
019	PSA	007	009	Oh, let the wickedness of the wicked be at an end; But establish the righteous! For the righteous God trieth the heart and the reins.
019	PSA	007	010	My shield is with God, Who saveth the upright in heart.
019	PSA	007	011	God is a righteous judge, And a God who is angry every day.
019	PSA	007	012	If he do not desist, He sharpeneth his sword; He bendeth his bow, and maketh it ready;
019	PSA	007	013	He prepareth for him the instruments of death; He shooteth his burning arrows.
019	PSA	007	014	Behold, he travailed with iniquity, And conceived mischief, But hath brought forth disappointment!
019	PSA	007	015	He made a pit and digged it. And is fallen into the ditch which he made.
019	PSA	007	016	His mischief returneth upon his own head, And his violence cometh down upon his own skull.
019	PSA	007	017	I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness; I will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high.
019	PSA	008	001	“For the leader of the music; to be accompanied with the gittith. A psalm of David.” O Jehovah, our Lord! How excellent is thy name in all the earth! Thou hast set thy glory above the heavens.
019	PSA	008	002	Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained praise, To put thine adversaries to shame, And to silence the enemy and avenger.
019	PSA	008	003	When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, The moon and the stars which thou hast ordained:
019	PSA	008	004	What is man, that thou art mindful of him, And the son of man, that thou carest for him?
019	PSA	008	005	Yet thou hast made him little lower than God; Thou hast crowned him with glory and honor.
019	PSA	008	006	Thou hast given him dominion over the works of thy hands; Thou hast put all things under his feet, —
019	PSA	008	007	All sheep and oxen, Yea, and the beasts of the forest;
019	PSA	008	008	The birds of the air, and the fishes of the sea, And whatever passeth through the paths of the deep.
019	PSA	008	009	O Jehovah, our Lord, How excellent is thy name in all the earth!
019	PSA	009	001	“For the leader of the music; to be sung in the manner or with the voice of maidens. To the Benites, or to Ben. A psalm of David.” I will praise thee, O LORD! with my whole heart; I will show forth all thy marvellous works.
019	PSA	009	002	I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thy name, O thou Most High!
019	PSA	009	003	All my enemies are turned back; They fall and perish at thy presence.
019	PSA	009	004	For thou dost defend my right and my cause; Thou sittest upon the throne, a righteous judge.
019	PSA	009	005	Thou rebukest the nations; Thou destroyest the wicked; Thou blottest out their name for evermore!
019	PSA	009	006	The enemy is fallen, —a desolation for ever! Thou, O LORD! hast destroyed their cities; Their memory itself hath perished!
019	PSA	009	007	The LORD reigneth for ever; He hath prepared his throne for judgment.
019	PSA	009	008	He judgeth the world in righteousness; He administereth judgment to the nations with uprightness.
019	PSA	009	009	Yea, the LORD is a refuge for the oppressed; A refuge in times of trouble.
019	PSA	009	010	They who know thy name put their trust in thee; For thou, O LORD! forsakest not them that seek thee!
019	PSA	009	011	Sing praises to the LORD, who reigneth in Zion; Declare his doings among the people!
019	PSA	009	012	As the avenger of blood, he remembereth the distressed; He forgetteth not their complaint.
019	PSA	009	013	“Have pity upon me, [[said I, ]] O LORD! Look upon my affliction through them that hate me; Lift me up from the gates of death:
019	PSA	009	014	That I may show forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion; That I may rejoice in salvation by thee.”
019	PSA	009	015	The nations have sunk into the pit which they made; In the net, which they hid, is their own foot taken.
019	PSA	009	016	Thus it is known that the LORD executeth judgment; The wicked are ensnared in the work of their own hands. [[Stringed instruments. (Pause)
019	PSA	009	017	The wicked shall be driven into the underworld; Yea, all the nations that forger God.
019	PSA	009	018	For the poor shall not always be forgotten; The hopes of the afflicted shall not perish for ever.
019	PSA	009	019	Arise, O LORD! Let not man prevail; Let the nations be judged by thee!
019	PSA	009	020	Strike terror into them, O LORD! Let the nations know that they are but men! (Pause)
019	PSA	010	001	Why standest thou afar off, O LORD? Why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble?
019	PSA	010	002	Through the haughtiness of the wicked the poor are in distress; They are caught in the wiles which are contrived for them.
019	PSA	010	003	The wicked boasteth of his heart's desire; The rapacious renounceth and contemneth Jehovah.
019	PSA	010	004	The wicked [[saith]] in his haughtiness, “He careth not!” All his thoughts are, “There is no God.”
019	PSA	010	005	His course is always prosperous; Far in the heights are thy judgments from him; As for all his enemies, he puffeth at them.
019	PSA	010	006	He saith in his heart, “I shall never fall; I shall never be in adversity.”
019	PSA	010	007	His mouth is full of perjury, deceit, and oppression; Mischief and injustice are upon his tongue.
019	PSA	010	008	He sitteth in the lurking-places of the villages; In secret places doth he murder the innocent; His eyes are secretly fixed upon the poor.
019	PSA	010	009	He secretly lieth in wait, like a lion in a thicket; He lieth in wait to seize upon the helpless; He catcheth the poor, drawing him into his net.
019	PSA	010	010	He croucheth, and lowereth himself, And the wretched fall into his paws.
019	PSA	010	011	He saith in his heart, “God doth forget; He hideth his face; he doth never see it.”
019	PSA	010	012	Arise, O LORD! O God, lift up thine hand: Forget not the distressed!
019	PSA	010	013	Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God, And say in his heart, “He careth not for it”?
019	PSA	010	014	Thou dost see it; yea, thou beholdest malice and oppression, And markest it upon thy hand! The poor committeth himself to thee; Thou art the helper of the fatherless.
019	PSA	010	015	Break thou the arm of the unjust and wicked man; Seek out his wickedness, till thou canst find none!
019	PSA	010	016	Jehovah is king for ever and ever; The gentiles shall perish out of his land.
019	PSA	010	017	Thou, O LORD! wilt hear the desires of the distressed; Thou wilt strengthen their hearts; Thou wilt lend a listening ear!
019	PSA	010	018	Thou wilt maintain the cause of the fatherless and the oppressed, That henceforth none may be driven from the land.
019	PSA	011	001	“For the leader of the music. A psalm of David.” In the LORD do I put my trust. Why say ye to me, “Flee, like a bird, to your mountain?
019	PSA	011	002	For, lo! the wicked bend their bow; They make ready their arrows on the string, To shoot in secret at the upright in heart.
019	PSA	011	003	If the pillars be broken down, What can the righteous do?”
019	PSA	011	004	The LORD is in his holy palace; The LORD'S throne is in heaven; His eyes behold, his eyelids prove the children of men.
019	PSA	011	005	The LORD trieth the righteous; But the wicked, and the lover of violence, his soul hateth.
019	PSA	011	006	Upon the wicked he will rain lightning; Fire and brimstone and a burning wind shall be the portion of their cup.
019	PSA	011	007	For the LORD is righteous; he loveth righteousness; The upright shall see his face.
019	PSA	012	001	“For the leader of the music; to the octave. A psalm of David.” Help, LORD; for the godly man ceaseth; The faithful are failing among men.
019	PSA	012	002	They speak falsehood one to another; With flattering lips, with a double heart, do they speak.
019	PSA	012	003	May the LORD destroy all flattering lips, And the tongue which speaketh proud things!
019	PSA	012	004	Who say, “With our tongues will we prevail; Our lips are our reliance; Who is lord over us?”
019	PSA	012	005	For the oppression of the poor and the sighing of the wretched, Now will I stand up, saith the LORD; I will set in safety him whom they puff at.
019	PSA	012	006	The words of the LORD are pure; Like silver purified in a furnace on the earth, Seven times refined.
019	PSA	012	007	Thou, O LORD! will watch over them; Thou wilt preserve them from this generation for ever.
019	PSA	012	008	The wicked walk on every side, When the vilest of men are exalted.
019	PSA	013	001	“For the leader of the music. A psalm of David.” How long, O LORD! wilt thou forget me for ever? How long wilt thou hide thy face from me?
019	PSA	013	002	How long shall I have anxiety in my soul for ever, And sorrow in my heart all the day? How long shall my enemy be exalted over me?
019	PSA	013	003	Look down and hear me, O LORD, my God! Enlighten my eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death;
019	PSA	013	004	Lest my enemy say, “I have prevailed against him!” Lest my adversaries rejoice, when I am fallen.
019	PSA	013	005	Yet will I trust in thy goodness; My heart shall rejoice in thy salvation;
019	PSA	013	006	I will sing to the LORD, that he hath dealt kindly with me.
019	PSA	014	001	“For the leader of the music. A psalm of David.” The fool saith in his heart, “There is no God.” They are corrupt; abominable are their doings; There is none that doeth good.
019	PSA	014	002	Jehovah looketh down from heaven upon the children of men, To see if there are any that have understanding, That have regard to God.
019	PSA	014	003	They are all gone out of the way; together are they corrupt; There is none that doeth good—no, not one.
019	PSA	014	004	Shall not the evil-doers be requited, Who devour my people like bread, And call not upon Jehovah?
019	PSA	014	005	Yea, then shall they be in great fear; For Jehovah is with the race of the righteous.
019	PSA	014	006	Ye would put to shame the counsel of the poor; But Jehovah is their refuge.
019	PSA	014	007	Oh that salvation for Israel would come out of Zion! When Jehovah bringeth back the captives of his people, Then shall Jacob rejoice, and Israel be glad.
019	PSA	015	001	“A psalm of David.” LORD, who shall abide at thy tabernacle? Who shall dwell upon thy holy hill?
019	PSA	015	002	He that walketh uprightly, and doeth righteousness, And speaketh the truth from his heart;
019	PSA	015	003	He that slandereth not with his tongue, That doeth no injury to his neighbor, And uttereth no reproach against his neighbor;
019	PSA	015	004	In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; But who honoreth them that fear the LORD; Who sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not;
019	PSA	015	005	He that lendeth not his money for interest, And taketh not a bribe against the innocent: He that doeth these things shall never be moved.
019	PSA	016	001	“A psalm off David.” Preserve me, O God! for to thee do I look for help.
019	PSA	016	002	I have said to Jehovah, Thou art my Lord; I have no happiness beyond thee!
019	PSA	016	003	The holy that are in the land, and the excellent, —in them is all my delight.
019	PSA	016	004	They who hasten after other gods shall have multiplied sorrows; Their drink-offerings of blood I will not offer, Nor will I take their names upon my lips.
019	PSA	016	005	Jehovah is my portion and my cup; Thou wilt maintain my lot!
019	PSA	016	006	My portion hath fallen to me in pleasant places; Yea, I have a goodly inheritance.
019	PSA	016	007	I will bless the LORD, who careth for me; Yea, in the night my heart admonisheth me.
019	PSA	016	008	I set the LORD before me at all times; Since he is at my right hand, I shall not fall.
019	PSA	016	009	Therefore my heart is glad, and my spirit rejoiceth; Yea, my flesh dwelleth in security.
019	PSA	016	010	For thou wilt not give me up to the underworld; Nor wilt thou suffer thy holy one to see the pit.
019	PSA	016	011	Thou wilt show me the path of life; In thy presence is fulness of joy; At thy right hand are pleasures for evermore.
019	PSA	017	001	“A psalm of David.” Hear the righteous cause, O LORD! Attend to my cry; Give ear to my prayer from lips without deceit!
019	PSA	017	002	May my sentence come forth from thy presence; May thine eyes behold uprightness!
019	PSA	017	003	Provest thou my heart, visitest thou me in the night, Triest thou me like gold, thou shalt find nothing!
019	PSA	017	004	My thoughts do not vary from my lips. As to the deeds of men, Through the word of thy lips I have kept me from the paths of the destroyer.
019	PSA	017	005	Support my steps in thy paths, That my feet may not slip!
019	PSA	017	006	I call upon thee, O God! for thou wilt hear me; Incline thine ear to me, and listen to my prayer!
019	PSA	017	007	Show forth thy loving-kindness, O thou that savest by thy right hand Them that seek refuge in thee from their adversaries!
019	PSA	017	008	Guard me as the apple of the eye; Hide me under the shadow of thy wings
019	PSA	017	009	From the wicked who assault me, From my deadly enemies who compass me about!
019	PSA	017	010	They shut up their hard heart; With their mouth they speak haughtily.
019	PSA	017	011	They encompass us in all our steps; They fix their eyes upon us, that they may cast us on the ground.
019	PSA	017	012	They are like a lion, eager for his prey; Like a young lion, lurking in secret places.
019	PSA	017	013	Arise, O LORD! disappoint them, cast them down! Deliver me from the wicked by thy sword,
019	PSA	017	014	From men, by thy hand, O LORD! from men of the world, Whose portion is in life; whom thou loadest with thy treasure; Whose children have enough, and leave their superfluity to their children.
019	PSA	017	015	But I through righteousness shall see thy face; I shall be satisfied with the revival of thy countenance.
019	PSA	018	001	I love thee, O LORD, my strength!
019	PSA	018	002	Jehovah is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer; My God, my strength, in whom I trust; My shield, my strong defence, and my high tower.
019	PSA	018	003	I called upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised, And was delivered from my enemies.
019	PSA	018	004	The snares of death encompassed me; The floods of destruction filled me with dismay;
019	PSA	018	005	The snares of the underworld surrounded me, And the nets of death seized upon me.
019	PSA	018	006	In my distress I called upon the LORD, And cried unto my God; He heard my voice from his palace, And my cry came before him into his ears.
019	PSA	018	007	Then the earth quaked and trembled; The foundations of the mountains rocked and were shaken, Because his wrath was kindled.
019	PSA	018	008	A smoke went up from his nostrils, And fire from his mouth devoured; Burning coals shot forth from him.
019	PSA	018	009	He bowed the heavens, and came down; And darkness was under his feet;
019	PSA	018	010	And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly; Yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind.
019	PSA	018	011	And he made darkness his covering; His pavilion round about him was dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.
019	PSA	018	012	At the brightness before him, his thick clouds passed away; Then came hailstones and coals of fire.
019	PSA	018	013	The LORD also thundered from heaven, And the Most High uttered his voice, Amid hailstones and coals of fire.
019	PSA	018	014	He sent forth his arrows, and scattered them; Continual lightnings, and discomfited them.
019	PSA	018	015	Then the channels of the deep were seen, And the foundations of the earth were laid bare At thy rebuke, O LORD! At the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.
019	PSA	018	016	He stretched forth his hand from above; he took me, And drew me out of deep waters.
019	PSA	018	017	He delivered me from my strong enemy; From my adversaries, who were too powerful for me.
019	PSA	018	018	They fell upon me in the day of my calamity; But the LORD was my stay.
019	PSA	018	019	He brought me forth into a large place; He delivered me, because he delighted in me.
019	PSA	018	020	The LORD hath rewarded me according to my righteous; According to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.
019	PSA	018	021	For I have kept the ways of the LORD, And have not wickedly departed from my God.
019	PSA	018	022	For all his laws were in my sight; I did not put away his statutes from me.
019	PSA	018	023	I was upright before him, And kept myself from iniquity.
019	PSA	018	024	Therefore hath the LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness, According to the cleanness of my hands before his eyes.
019	PSA	018	025	To the merciful thou showest thyself merciful; To the upright thou showest thyself upright;
019	PSA	018	026	To the pure thou showest thyself pure, And to the perverse thou showest thyself perverse.
019	PSA	018	027	For thou savest the afflicted people, But the haughty countenance thou bringest down.
019	PSA	018	028	Thou causest my lamp to shine; Jehovah, my God, enlighteneth my darkness.
019	PSA	018	029	For through thee I have broken through troops; Through my God I have leaped over walls.
019	PSA	018	030	The ways of God are just and true; His word is pure, tried in the fire; He is a shield to all who put their trust in him.
019	PSA	018	031	Who, then, is God, save Jehovah? And who is a rock, save our God?
019	PSA	018	032	It is God that girded me with strength, And made my way plain.
019	PSA	018	033	He made my feet like the hind's, And set me in my high places;
019	PSA	018	034	He taught my hands to war, So that my arm bent the bow of brass.
019	PSA	018	035	Thou gavest me the shield of thy protection; Thy right hand held me up, And thy goodness made me great.
019	PSA	018	036	Thou didst make a wide path for my steps, So that my feet did not stumble.
019	PSA	018	037	I pursued my enemies and overtook them, And turned not back till I had destroyed them.
019	PSA	018	038	I smote them, so that they could not rise; They fell under my feet.
019	PSA	018	039	Thou didst gird me with strength for the battle; Thou didst cast down my adversaries under me.
019	PSA	018	040	Thou didst cause my enemies to turn their backs, So that I destroyed them that hated me.
019	PSA	018	041	They cried, but there was none to help; To Jehovah, but he answered them not.
019	PSA	018	042	I beat them small, like dust before the wind; I cast them out as the dirt of the streets.
019	PSA	018	043	Thou hast delivered me from the assaults of the nations; Thou hast made me the head of the kingdoms. Nations whom I knew not serve me;
019	PSA	018	044	They who have only heard of me obey me; Yea, men of a strange land submit themselves to me;
019	PSA	018	045	Men of a strange land fade away, like a leaf, And come trembling from their strongholds.
019	PSA	018	046	Jehovah is the living God; blessed be my rock; Exalted be the God of my salvation!
019	PSA	018	047	It is God who hath given me vengeance, And subdued the nations under me;
019	PSA	018	048	He delivered me from my enemies; Yea, thou hast lifted me up above my adversaries; Thou hast saved me from the violent man!
019	PSA	018	049	Therefore I will give thanks to thee, O LORD! among the nations, And sing praises to thy name.
019	PSA	018	050	Great deliverance giveth he to his king, And showeth mercy to his anointed, —To David and to his posterity for ever.
019	PSA	019	001	“For the leader of the music. A psalm of David.” The heavens declare the glory of God; The firmament showeth forth the work of his hands.
019	PSA	019	002	Day uttereth instruction unto day, And night showeth knowledge unto night.
019	PSA	019	003	They have no speech nor language, And their voice is not heard;
019	PSA	019	004	Yet their sound goeth forth to all the earth, And their words to the ends of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun,
019	PSA	019	005	Which cometh forth like a bridegroom from his chamber, And rejoiceth, like a strong man, to run his course.
019	PSA	019	006	He goeth forth from the extremity of heaven, And maketh his circuit to the end of it; And nothing is hid from his heat.
019	PSA	019	007	The law of the LORD is perfect, reviving the soul; The precepts of the LORD are sure, making wise the simple;
019	PSA	019	008	The statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart; The commandments of the LORD are pure, enlightening the eyes;
019	PSA	019	009	The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring for ever; The judgments of the LORD are true and righteous altogether.
019	PSA	019	010	More precious are they than gold; yea, than much fine gold; Sweeter than honey and the honeycomb.
019	PSA	019	011	By them also is thy servant warned, And in keeping of them there is great reward.
019	PSA	019	012	Who knoweth his own offences? Oh, cleanse thou me from secret faults!
019	PSA	019	013	Keep back also thy servant from presumptuous sins; Let them not have dominion over me! Then shall I be upright; I shall not be polluted with gross transgression.
019	PSA	019	014	May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart Be acceptable in thy sight, O LORD, my strength and my redeemer!
019	PSA	020	001	“For the leader of the music. A psalm of David.” May Jehovah hear thee in the day of trouble; May the name of the God of Jacob defend thee!
019	PSA	020	002	May he send thee help from his sanctuary, And strengthen thee out of Zion!
019	PSA	020	003	May he have regard to all thine offerings, And accept thy burnt sacrifice! (Pause)
019	PSA	020	004	May he grant thee thy heart's desire, And fulfill all thy purposes!
019	PSA	020	005	We will rejoice in thy protection, And in the name of our God will we set up our banners, When Jehovah hath fulfilled all thy petitions.
019	PSA	020	006	Now I know that Jehovah helpeth his anointed; That he heareth him from his holy heaven, And aideth him with the saving strength of his right hand.
019	PSA	020	007	Some glory in chariots, and some in horses, But we in the name of Jehovah our God.
019	PSA	020	008	They stumble and fall, But we stand and are erect.
019	PSA	020	009	The LORD save the king! May he hear us when we call!
019	PSA	021	001	“For the leader of the music. A psalm of David.” The king rejoiceth in thy strength, O LORD! Yea, he doth greatly exult in thy protection.
019	PSA	021	002	Thou hast given him his heart's desire, And hast not denied him the request of his lips. (Pause)
019	PSA	021	003	Yea, thou hast met him with rich blessings, Thou hast placed a crown of pure gold upon his head.
019	PSA	021	004	He asked life of thee; thou gavest it him; Even long life, enduring for ever.
019	PSA	021	005	Great is his glory through thine aid; Honor and majesty hast thou laid upon him.
019	PSA	021	006	Thou hast made him blessed for evermore; Thou hast made him glad with the joy of thy countenance.
019	PSA	021	007	For the king trusteth in the LORD; And through the goodness of the Most High he shall never fall.
019	PSA	021	008	Thy hand shall overtake all thine enemies; Thy right hand shall overtake them that hate thee.
019	PSA	021	009	Thou wilt make them like a burning oven in the time of thine anger; Jehovah shall swallow them up in his wrath, And the fire shall devour them.
019	PSA	021	010	Their offspring shalt thou destroy from the earth, And their posterity from the sons of men.
019	PSA	021	011	For they spread a net of mischief against thee; They devised plots against thee, but they did not prevail.
019	PSA	021	012	Therefore thou wilt cause them to turn their backs; Thou wilt make ready thine arrows upon the strings against them.
019	PSA	021	013	Exalt thyself, O LORD! by thy strength! So will we sing, and praise thy mighty deeds.
019	PSA	022	001	“For the leader of the music. To the tune of “The hind of the morning.” A psalm of David.” My God, my God! why hast thou forsaken me? Why so far from mine aid, and from the words of my cry?
019	PSA	022	002	O my God! I cry during the day, but thou hearest not; In the night also, but I have no rest.
019	PSA	022	003	And yet thou art holy, Dwelling amid the praises of Israel!
019	PSA	022	004	Our fathers trusted in thee; They trusted, and thou didst save them.
019	PSA	022	005	They called upon thee, and were delivered; They trusted in thee, and were not put to shame.
019	PSA	022	006	But I am a worm, and not a man; The reproach of men, and the scorn of the people.
019	PSA	022	007	All who see me scoff at me; They open wide the lips; they shake the head.
019	PSA	022	008	“He trusted in the LORD, let him help him; Let him deliver him, since he delighted in him!”
019	PSA	022	009	Surely thou art he that didst bring me into the world; Thou didst make me lie secure upon my mother's breast!
019	PSA	022	010	Upon thee have I cast myself from my birth; Thou hast been my God from my earliest breath!
019	PSA	022	011	Oh, be not far from me, for trouble is near; For there is none to help!
019	PSA	022	012	Many bulls surround me; Strong bulls of Bashan close me in on every side.
019	PSA	022	013	They open their mouths wide against me, Like a ravening and roaring lion.
019	PSA	022	014	I am poured out like water, And all my bones are out of joint; My heart is become like wax; It melteth in my bosom.
019	PSA	022	015	My strength is dried up like an earthen vessel, And my tongue cleaveth to my jaws; Thou hast brought me to the dust of death!
019	PSA	022	016	For dogs have surrounded me; Bands of evil-doers have encompassed me, —Like lions my hands and my feet.
019	PSA	022	017	I can count all my bones; They gaze, and feast their eyes upon me.
019	PSA	022	018	They divide my garments among them, And for my vesture they cast lots.
019	PSA	022	019	But be not thou far from me, O LORD! O my strength! make haste to mine aid!
019	PSA	022	020	Deliver my life from the sword; My blood from the power of the dog;
019	PSA	022	021	Save me from the lion's mouth; Shield me from the horns of the buffaloes!
019	PSA	022	022	I will proclaim thy name to my brethren; In the midst of the congregation will I praise thee.
019	PSA	022	023	Praise him, ye worshippers of Jehovah! Extol him, all ye race of Jacob. And fear him, all ye race of Israel!
019	PSA	022	024	For he hath not despised nor abhorred the misery of the afflicted. Nor hath he hid his face from him; But when he cried unto him, he heard.
019	PSA	022	025	My praise shall be of thee in the great congregation; I will pay my vows before them that fear him!
019	PSA	022	026	The afflicted shall eat, and be satisfied; They that seek the LORD shall praise him; Your hearts shall be glad for ever and ever!
019	PSA	022	027	All the ends of the earth shall remember, and turn to Jehovah; All the families of the nations shall worship before thee!
019	PSA	022	028	For the kingdom is Jehovah's; He is the governor of the nations.
019	PSA	022	029	All the rich of the earth shall eat and worship; Before him shall they also bow, who are going down to the dust, Who cannot keep themselves alive.
019	PSA	022	030	The future generation shall serve him; The race which is to come shall hear of Jehovah.
019	PSA	022	031	They shall come, and declare his righteousness; His mighty deeds to the people that shall be born.
019	PSA	023	001	“A psalm of David.” The LORD is my shepherd: I shall not want.
019	PSA	023	002	He maketh me to lie down in green pastures; He leadeth me beside the still waters.
019	PSA	023	003	He reviveth my soul; He leadeth me in paths of safety, For his name's sake.
019	PSA	023	004	When I walk through a valley of deathlike shade, I fear no evil; for thou art with me; Thy crook and thy staff, they comfort me.
019	PSA	023	005	Thou preparest a table before me In the presence of mine enemies. Thou anointest my head with oil; My cup runneth over.
019	PSA	023	006	Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, And I shall dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.
019	PSA	024	001	“A psalm of David.” The earth is the LORD'S, and all that is therein; The world, and they who inhabit it.
019	PSA	024	002	For he hath founded it upon the seas, And established it upon the floods.
019	PSA	024	003	Who shall ascend the hill of the LORD? And who shall stand in his holy place?
019	PSA	024	004	He that hath clean hands and a pure heart; Who hath not inclined his soul to falsehood, Nor sworn deceitfully.
019	PSA	024	005	He shall receive a blessing from the LORD, And favor from the God of his salvation.
019	PSA	024	006	This is the race of them that seek him; They that seek thy face are Jacob. (Pause)
019	PSA	024	007	Lift up your heads, O ye gates! Lift yourselves up, ye everlasting doors, That the king of glory may come in!
019	PSA	024	008	“Who is this king of glory?” Jehovah, strong and mighty; Jehovah, mighty in battle.
019	PSA	024	009	Lift up your heads, O ye gates! Lift yourselves up, ye everlasting doors, That the king of glory may enter in!
019	PSA	024	010	“Who is this king of glory?” Jehovah, God of hosts, he is the king of glory. (Pause)
019	PSA	025	001	“A psalm of David.” To thee, O LORD! do I lift up my soul.
019	PSA	025	002	O my God! I trust in thee; let me not be put to shame! Let not my enemies triumph over me!
019	PSA	025	003	Yea, none that hope in thee shall be put to shame: They shall be put to shame who wickedly forsake thee.
019	PSA	025	004	Cause me to know thy ways, O LORD! Teach me thy paths!
019	PSA	025	005	Lead me in thy truth, and teach me! For thou art the God from whom cometh my help; In thee do I trust at all times!
019	PSA	025	006	Remember thy loving-kindness, O LORD! and thy tender mercy, Which thou hast exercised of old!
019	PSA	025	007	Remember not the faults and transgressions of my youth! According to thy mercy remember thou me, For thy goodness' sake, O LORD!
019	PSA	025	008	Good and righteous is the LORD; Therefore showeth he to sinners the way.
019	PSA	025	009	The humble he guideth in his statutes, And the humble he teacheth his way.
019	PSA	025	010	All the doings of the LORD are mercy and truth To those who keep his covenant and his precepts.
019	PSA	025	011	For thy name's sake, O LORD, Pardon my iniquity; for it is great!
019	PSA	025	012	Who is the man that feareth the LORD? Him doth he show the way which he should choose.
019	PSA	025	013	He shall himself dwell in prosperity, And his offspring shall inherit the land.
019	PSA	025	014	The friendship of the LORD is with them that fear him, And he will teach them his covenant.
019	PSA	025	015	Mine eyes are ever directed to the LORD, For he will pluck my feet from the net.
019	PSA	025	016	Look upon me, and pity me; For I am desolate and afflicted!
019	PSA	025	017	Lighten the sorrows of my heart, And deliver me from my troubles!
019	PSA	025	018	Look upon my affliction and distress, And forgive all my sins!
019	PSA	025	019	Consider how many are my enemies, And with what violence they hate me!
019	PSA	025	020	Guard thou my life, and deliver me! Let me not be put to shame, for I have trusted in thee!
019	PSA	025	021	Let integrity and uprightness preserve me, For on thee do I rest my hope!
019	PSA	025	022	Redeem Israel, O God! from all his troubles!
019	PSA	026	001	“A psalm of David.” Be thou my judge, O LORD! for I have walked in uprightness. I have put my trust in the LORD, therefore shall I not fall.
019	PSA	026	002	Examine me, O LORD! and prove me; Try my reins and my heart!
019	PSA	026	003	For thy kindness is ever before my eyes, And I walk in thy truth.
019	PSA	026	004	I sit not with men of falsehood. And go not in company with dissemblers.
019	PSA	026	005	I hate the assembly of evil-doers, And do not sit with the wicked.
019	PSA	026	006	I wash my hands in innocence. And go around thine altar. O LORD!
019	PSA	026	007	To utter the voice of thanksgiving, And tell of all thy wondrous works.
019	PSA	026	008	O LORD! I love the habitation of thy house, The place where thine honor dwelleth!
019	PSA	026	009	Gather not my breath with sinners, Nor my life with men of blood,
019	PSA	026	010	In whose hands is mischief, And whose right hands are full of bribes!
019	PSA	026	011	But as for me, I walk in my integrity; Oh, redeem me, and be merciful to me!
019	PSA	026	012	My feet tread in a straight path; In the congregation will I bless the LORD.
019	PSA	027	001	“A psalm of David.” The LORD is my light and my salvation; Whom shall I fear? The LORD is the shield of my life; Of whom shall I be afraid?
019	PSA	027	002	When the wicked came upon me to devour me, Even my persecutors and enemies, they stumbled and fell.
019	PSA	027	003	Though a host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear; Though war should rise against me, yet will I be confident.
019	PSA	027	004	One thing have I desired of the LORD; that do I yet seek; That I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, To behold the grace of the LORD, And to gaze upon his temple.
019	PSA	027	005	For in the day of trouble he will hide me in his pavilion; Yea, in the secret place of his tabernacle will he shelter me; He will set me upon a rock.
019	PSA	027	006	Yea, already doth he lift my head above my enemies, who are around me; Therefore in his tabernacle will I offer sacrifices with the sound of trumpets; I will sing, yea, with instruments of music I will give praise to the LORD.
019	PSA	027	007	Hear my voice, O LORD! when I cry unto thee; Have pity upon me, and answer me!
019	PSA	027	008	When I think of thy precept, “Seek ye my face!” Thy face, LORD, do I seek.
019	PSA	027	009	O hide not thou thy face from me; Cast not thy servant away in displeasure! Thou hast been my help, do not leave me; Do not forsake me, O God, my helper!
019	PSA	027	010	For my father and my mother have forsaken me; But the LORD will take me up.
019	PSA	027	011	Teach me thy way, O LORD! And lead me in the right path, because of my enemies!
019	PSA	027	012	Give me not up to the will of my adversaries! For false witnesses have risen up against me, And such as breathe out injustice.
019	PSA	027	013	I trust that I shall see the goodness of the LORD In the land of the living. Hope thou in the LORD!
019	PSA	027	014	Be of good courage; let thy heart be strong; Hope thou in the LORD!
019	PSA	028	001	“A psalm of David.” To thee do I cry, O LORD! O my rock! be not silent to me, Lest, if thou answer me not, I become like those who go down to the pit!
019	PSA	028	002	Hear the voice of my supplication, when I cry unto thee, When I lift up my hands to thy most holy sanctuary!
019	PSA	028	003	Draw me not away with the impious, and with evil-doers, Who speak peace to their neighbors, while mischief is in their hearts!
019	PSA	028	004	Give them according to their deeds, and the wickedness of their doings; Give them according to the work of their hands; Render to them their desert!
019	PSA	028	005	For they regard not the doings of the LORD, nor the work of his hands; Therefore will he destroy them, and not again build them up.
019	PSA	028	006	Praised be the LORD, for he hath heard the voice of my supplications!
019	PSA	028	007	The LORD is my strength and my shield; My heart trusteth in him, and he helpeth me; Therefore doth my heart exult, And in my song I will praise him.
019	PSA	028	008	Jehovah is the strength of his people; He is the protecting shield of his anointed.
019	PSA	028	009	Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance; Feed them also, and build them up for ever!
019	PSA	029	001	“A psalm of David.” Give to Jehovah, O ye sons of God! Give to Jehovah glory and praise!
019	PSA	029	002	Give to Jehovah the glory due to his name; Worship Jehovah in holy attire!
019	PSA	029	003	The voice of Jehovah is heard above the waters; The God of glory thundereth, -Jehovah above the great waters.
019	PSA	029	004	The voice of Jehovah is powerful; The voice of Jehovah is full of majesty;
019	PSA	029	005	The voice of Jehovah breaketh the cedars; Yea, Jehovah breaketh the cedars of Lebanon;
019	PSA	029	006	Yea, he maketh them to leap like a calf, —Lebanon and Sirion like a young buffalo.
019	PSA	029	007	The voice of Jehovah divideth the flames of fire.
019	PSA	029	008	The voice of Jehovah maketh the wilderness tremble; Yea, Jehovah maketh the wilderness of Kadesh tremble.
019	PSA	029	009	The voice of Jehovah maketh the hinds bring forth, And layeth bare the forests; While, in his palace, every one declareth his glory.
019	PSA	029	010	Jehovah sitteth above the flood; Yea, Jehovah sitteth king for ever.
019	PSA	029	011	Jehovah will give strength to his people; Jehovah will bless his people with peace.
019	PSA	030	001	“A psalm of David. To the air of songs for the dedication of a house.” I will extol thee, O LORD! for thou hast lifted me up, And hast not suffered my enemies to rejoice over me.
019	PSA	030	002	O Jehovah, my God! I called upon thee, and thou hast healed me!
019	PSA	030	003	O LORD! thou hast raised me up from the underworld; Thou hast kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.
019	PSA	030	004	Sing unto the LORD, O ye his servants! And praise his holy name!
019	PSA	030	005	For his anger endureth but a moment, But his favor through life; In the evening sorrow may be a guest, But joy cometh in the morning.
019	PSA	030	006	I said in my prosperity, “I shall never be moved!”
019	PSA	030	007	Thou, O LORD! by thy favor, hast made my mountain to stand strong; Thou didst hide thy face, and I was troubled!
019	PSA	030	008	I cried unto thee, O LORD! To the LORD I made supplication:
019	PSA	030	009	“What will my blood profit thee, that I should go down to the pit? Can dust praise thee? Can it declare thy faithfulness?
019	PSA	030	010	Hear, O LORD! and have pity upon me! Be thou, LORD! my helper!”
019	PSA	030	011	Thou didst turn my mourning into dancing; Thou didst loose my sackcloth, and gird me with gladness.
019	PSA	030	012	Therefore I will sing praise to thee, and not be silent. O Jehovah, my God! I will give thanks to thee for ever!
019	PSA	031	001	“For the leader of the music. A psalm of David.” In thee, O LORD! do I trust; let me never be put to shame; According to thy goodness deliver me!
019	PSA	031	002	Bow down thine ear to me; help me speedily! Be to me a strong rock, a high fortress, for my deliverance!
019	PSA	031	003	For thou art my rock and my high fortress; Be thou also my guide, and lead me, for thy name's sake!
019	PSA	031	004	Draw me out of the net which they have secretly laid for me, For thou art my strength!
019	PSA	031	005	Into thy hand I commit my life; Thou wilt deliver me, O LORD, thou God of truth!
019	PSA	031	006	I hate those who regard lying vanities, And put my trust in the LORD.
019	PSA	031	007	I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy, That thou hast looked upon my trouble, And hast had regard to my distress;
019	PSA	031	008	That thou hast not given me up to the hands of my enemies, But hast set my feet in a wide place.
019	PSA	031	009	Have mercy upon me, O LORD! for I am in trouble! My face is consumed with grief; Yea, my spirit and my body.
019	PSA	031	010	For my life is wasted with sorrow, And my years with sighing; My strength faileth by reason of my affliction, And my bones are consumed on account of all my enemies.
019	PSA	031	011	I have become the scorn of my neighbors, And the terror of my acquaintance; They who see me abroad flee from me.
019	PSA	031	012	I am forgotten like a dead man out of mind; I am like a broken vessel.
019	PSA	031	013	I hear the slander of many; fear is on every side; For they take counsel together against me; They devise to take away my life.
019	PSA	031	014	But I trust in thee, O Jehovah! I say, “Thou art my God!”
019	PSA	031	015	My destiny is in thy hand; Deliver me from the power of my enemies and persecutors!
019	PSA	031	016	Let thy face shine upon thy servant, And save me through thy mercy!
019	PSA	031	017	Let me not be put to shame, O LORD! for I have called upon thee; Let the wicked be put to shame; Let them be silenced in the grave!
019	PSA	031	018	Let lying lips be put to silence, Which speak proud things against the righteous, With haughtiness and contempt!
019	PSA	031	019	O how great is thy goodness, which thou treasurest up for them that fear thee; Which thou showest to them that trust in thee, before the sons of men!
019	PSA	031	020	Thou hidest them in the secret place of thy presence from the machinations of men; Thou shelterest them in thy pavilion from the violence of tongues.
019	PSA	031	021	Praised be the LORD; for he hath shown me his wonderful kindness, As in a fortified city!
019	PSA	031	022	I said in my distress, “I am cut off from before thine eyes;” But thou didst hear the voice of my supplication, When I cried unto thee.
019	PSA	031	023	O love the LORD, all ye his servants; For the LORD preserveth the faithful, And requiteth the proud in full measure!
019	PSA	031	024	Be of good courage; let your hearts be strong, All ye who trust in the LORD!
019	PSA	032	001	“A psalm of David.” Happy is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is pardoned!
019	PSA	032	002	Happy the man to whom the LORD imputeth not iniquity, And in whose spirit there is no guile!
019	PSA	032	003	While I kept silence, my bones were wasted, By reason of my groaning all the day long.
019	PSA	032	004	For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me; My moisture dried up, as in summer's drought.
019	PSA	032	005	At length I acknowledged to thee my sin, And did not hide my iniquity. I said, “I will confess my transgression to the LORD;” And thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin! (Pause)
019	PSA	032	006	Therefore shall every pious man pray to thee, while thou mayst be found; Surely the floods of great waters shall not come near him.
019	PSA	032	007	Thou art my hiding-place; thou preservest me from trouble; Thou compassest me about with songs of deliverance. (Pause)
019	PSA	032	008	I will instruct thee, and show thee the way thou shouldst go; I will give thee counsel, and keep mine eye upon thee.
019	PSA	032	009	Be ye not like the horse and the mule, which have no understanding, Whose mouths must be pressed with the bridle and curb, Because they will not come near thee!
019	PSA	032	010	The wicked hath many sorrows; But he that trusteth in the LORD is encompassed with mercies.
019	PSA	032	011	Rejoice in the LORD, and be glad, ye righteous; Shout for joy, all ye that are upright in heart!
019	PSA	033	001	Rejoice, O ye righteous, in the LORD! For praise becometh the upright.
019	PSA	033	002	Praise the LORD with the harp; Sing to him with the ten-stringed psaltery!
019	PSA	033	003	Sing to him a new song; Play skilfully amid the sound of trumpets!
019	PSA	033	004	For the word of the LORD is right, And all his acts are faithful.
019	PSA	033	005	He loveth justice and equity; The earth is full of the goodness of the LORD.
019	PSA	033	006	By the word of the LORD were the heavens made, And all the hosts of them by the breath of his mouth.
019	PSA	033	007	He gathereth the waters of the sea, as a heap; He layeth up the deep in storehouses.
019	PSA	033	008	Let all the earth fear the LORD; Let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him!
019	PSA	033	009	For he spake, and it was done; He commanded, and it stood fast.
019	PSA	033	010	The LORD bringeth the devices of the nations to nothing; He frustrateth the designs of kingdoms.
019	PSA	033	011	The purposes of the LORD stand for ever; The designs of his heart, to all generations.
019	PSA	033	012	Happy the nation whose God is Jehovah; The people whom he hath chosen for his inheritance.
019	PSA	033	013	The LORD looketh down from heaven; He beholdeth all the children of men;
019	PSA	033	014	From his dwelling-place he beholdeth all the inhabitants of the earth, —
019	PSA	033	015	He that formed the hearts of all, And observeth all their works.
019	PSA	033	016	A king is not saved by the number of his forces, Nor a hero by the greatness of his strength.
019	PSA	033	017	The horse is a vain thing for safety, Nor can he deliver his master by his great strength.
019	PSA	033	018	Behold, the eye of the LORD is upon them that fear him, —Upon them that trust in his goodness;
019	PSA	033	019	To save them from the power of death, And keep them alive in famine.
019	PSA	033	020	The hope of our souls is in the LORD; He is our help and our shield.
019	PSA	033	021	Yea, in him doth our heart rejoice; In his holy name we have confidence.
019	PSA	033	022	May thy goodness be upon us, O LORD! According as we trust in thee!
019	PSA	034	001	“A psalm of David, when he feigned himself mad before Abimelech, who drove him away, and he departed.” I will bless the LORD at all times; His praise shall continually be in my mouth.
019	PSA	034	002	In the LORD doth my soul boast; Let the afflicted hear, and rejoice!
019	PSA	034	003	O magnify the LORD with me, And let us exalt his name together!
019	PSA	034	004	I sought the LORD, and he heard me, And delivered me from all my fears.
019	PSA	034	005	Look up to him, and ye shall have light; Your faces shall never be ashamed.
019	PSA	034	006	This afflicted man cried, and the LORD heard, And saved him from all his troubles.
019	PSA	034	007	The angels of the LORD encamp around those who fear him, And deliver them.
019	PSA	034	008	O taste, and see how good is the LORD! Happy the man who trusteth in him!
019	PSA	034	009	O fear the LORD, ye his servants! For to those who fear him there shall be no want.
019	PSA	034	010	Young lions want, and suffer hunger; But they who fear the LORD want no good thing.
019	PSA	034	011	Come, ye children, hearken to me! I will teach you the fear of the LORD.
019	PSA	034	012	Who is he that loveth life, And desireth many days, in which he may see good?
019	PSA	034	013	Guard well thy tongue from evil, And thy lips from speaking guile!
019	PSA	034	014	Depart from evil, and do good; Seek peace, and pursue it!
019	PSA	034	015	The eyes of the LORD are upon the righteous, And his ears are open to their cry.
019	PSA	034	016	But the face of the LORD is against evil-doers, To cut off their remembrance from the earth.
019	PSA	034	017	The righteous cry, and the LORD heareth, And delivereth them from all their troubles.
019	PSA	034	018	The LORD is near to them that are of a broken heart, And saveth such as are of a contrite spirit.
019	PSA	034	019	Many are the afflictions of the righteous; But the LORD delivereth him from them all.
019	PSA	034	020	He guardeth all his bones; Not one of them shall be broken.
019	PSA	034	021	Calamity destroyeth the wicked, And they who hate the righteous suffer for it.
019	PSA	034	022	The LORD redeemeth the life of his servants, And none that put their trust in him will suffer for it.
019	PSA	035	001	“A psalm of David.” Contend, O LORD! with them that contend with me! Fight against them that fight against me!
019	PSA	035	002	Take hold of shield and buckler, And stand up for my help!
019	PSA	035	003	Draw forth the spear and the axe against my persecutors; Say to me, “I am thy salvation.”
019	PSA	035	004	May they be confounded and put to shame, who seek my life; May they be turned back with disgrace, who devise my hurt!
019	PSA	035	005	May they be like dust before the wind; May the angel of the LORD drive them!
019	PSA	035	006	May their way be dark and slippery, And may the angel of the LORD pursue them!
019	PSA	035	007	For without cause they have laid for me a snare; Without cause they have digged for me a pit.
019	PSA	035	008	May unforeseen destruction come upon them! May the snare which they have laid lay hold on themselves, And may they fall into destruction!
019	PSA	035	009	Then shall my soul rejoice in the LORD; It shall exult in his protection.
019	PSA	035	010	All my bones shall say, Who, O LORD! is like thee, Who dost rescue the afflicted from the oppressor, The afflicted and destitute from the spoiler?
019	PSA	035	011	False witnesses have risen up; They charge me with that which has not entered my mind.
019	PSA	035	012	They repay me evil for good; They cause bereavement to my soul.
019	PSA	035	013	And yet I, during their sickness, clothed myself with sackcloth, And afflicted myself with fasting; And my prayer was turned to my bosom.
019	PSA	035	014	I behaved myself as if he had been my friend or brother; I bowed down in sadness, as one mourning for his mother.
019	PSA	035	015	But at my fall they rejoice, and gather themselves together; Revilers whom I know not assemble themselves against me; They tear me without ceasing.
019	PSA	035	016	With base men who mock for their bread, They gnash at me with their teeth.
019	PSA	035	017	How long, O LORD! wilt thou look on? O rescue my life from the destruction they plot for me; My precious life from these young lions!
019	PSA	035	018	I will thank thee in the great assembly! Before a numerous people I will praise thee.
019	PSA	035	019	Let not them that are my enemies wrongfully triumph over me; Let them not wink with the eye, who hate me without cause!
019	PSA	035	020	For they speak not peace; They devise deceit against them that are quiet in the land.
019	PSA	035	021	Yea, they open their mouths wide against me; They say, “Aha, aha! our eyes seeth it.”
019	PSA	035	022	Thou seest it, O LORD! be not silent! O LORD! be not far from me!
019	PSA	035	023	Arouse thyself; awake for my defence! My God and my Lord, awake to my cause!
019	PSA	035	024	Judge me according to thy righteousness, O Jehovah, my God! Let them not triumph over me!
019	PSA	035	025	Let them not say in their hearts, “Aha! we have our wish!” Let them not say, “We have swallowed him up!”
019	PSA	035	026	May they all be confounded and brought to shame, Who rejoice at my calamity! May they be clothed with ignominy and disgrace, Who exalt themselves against me!
019	PSA	035	027	Let them shout for joy, and be glad, Who favor my righteous cause; Let them ever say, “The LORD be praised, Who delighteth in the prosperity of his servant!”
019	PSA	035	028	So shall my tongue speak of thy righteousness, And daily repeat thy praise.
019	PSA	036	001	“For the leader of the music. A psalm of David, the servant of the Lord.” To speak of the ungodliness of the wicked is in my heart. He hath no fear of God before his eyes.
019	PSA	036	002	For he flattereth himself in his own eyes, Till his iniquity is found out and hated.
019	PSA	036	003	The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit; He neglecteth to be wise and to do good.
019	PSA	036	004	He deviseth mischief upon his bed; He persevereth in an evil way; He abhorreth not sin.
019	PSA	036	005	Thy goodness, O LORD! reacheth to the heavens, And thy faithfulness to the clouds;
019	PSA	036	006	Thy righteousness is like the high mountains; Thy judgments are a great deep; Thou, O LORD! preservest man and beast!
019	PSA	036	007	How precious is thy loving-kindness, O God! Yea, the sons of men seek refuge under the shadow of thy wings.
019	PSA	036	008	They are satisfied with the abundance of thy house, And thou causest them to drink of the full stream of thy pleasures.
019	PSA	036	009	For with thee is the fountain of life; Through thy light we see light.
019	PSA	036	010	O continue thy loving-kindness to them that know thee, And thy favor to the upright in heart!
019	PSA	036	011	Let not the foot of the proud come upon me, Nor the hand of the wicked remove me!
019	PSA	036	012	Lo! already are the workers of iniquity fallen; They are cast down; they are unable to rise!
019	PSA	037	001	“A psalm of David.” Be not thou angry on account of the wicked, Nor be envious of those who do iniquity.
019	PSA	037	002	For soon shall they be cut down like grass, And wither like the green herb.
019	PSA	037	003	Trust in the LORD, and do good; Abide in the land, and delight in faithfulness.
019	PSA	037	004	Place thy delight in the LORD. And he will give thee thy heart's desires.
019	PSA	037	005	Commit thy way to the LORD; Trust in him, and he will give thee success!
019	PSA	037	006	He will cause thy justice to shine forth like the light, And thy righteousness like the noonday's brightness.
019	PSA	037	007	Hope thou patiently on the LORD, And in him place thy trust! Be not angry on account of the prosperous, —On account of him that deviseth deceit!
019	PSA	037	008	Cease from anger; give not way to wrath; Be not provoked, so as to do evil!
019	PSA	037	009	For evil-doers shall be rooted out; But they who trust in the LORD, they shall inherit the land.
019	PSA	037	010	Yet a little while, and the wicked shall be no more; Thou mayst look for his place, and he will not be found.
019	PSA	037	011	But the meek shall inherit the land, And delight themselves in the fulness of prosperity.
019	PSA	037	012	The wicked man plotteth against the just, And gnasheth at him with his teeth.
019	PSA	037	013	The Lord laugheth at him; For he seeth that his day is coming.
019	PSA	037	014	The wicked draw the sword, And bend their bow, To cast down the afflicted and the needy, And to slay the upright.
019	PSA	037	015	Their swords shall enter their own hearts, And their bows shall be broken in pieces.
019	PSA	037	016	Better is the little of the righteous man Than the great abundance of the wicked;
019	PSA	037	017	For the arms of the wicked shall be broken, But the LORD will uphold the righteous.
019	PSA	037	018	The LORD careth for the life of the upright, And their inheritance shall endure for ever.
019	PSA	037	019	They shall not be ashamed in the evil time, And in the days of famine they shall have enough.
019	PSA	037	020	But the wicked shall perish; Yea, the enemies of the LORD shall be consumed, like the glory of the fields; They shall be consumed into smoke.
019	PSA	037	021	The wicked borroweth, and repayeth not; But the righteous is merciful and bountiful.
019	PSA	037	022	For they who are blessed by God shall inherit the land, And they who are cursed by him shall be rooted out.
019	PSA	037	023	The steps of the good man are directed by the LORD; He delighteth himself in his way.
019	PSA	037	024	Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down, For the LORD holdeth him by the hand.
019	PSA	037	025	I have been young, and now am old; Yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, Nor his offspring begging bread.
019	PSA	037	026	He is ever merciful and lendeth, And his offspring shall be blessed.
019	PSA	037	027	Depart from evil, and do good; So thou shalt dwell in the land for ever.
019	PSA	037	028	For the LORD loveth righteousness, And forsaketh not his servants; They are preserved for ever; But the posterity of the wicked shall be rooted out.
019	PSA	037	029	The righteous shall inherit the land, And shall dwell therein for ever.
019	PSA	037	030	The mouth of the righteous uttereth wisdom, And his tongue speaketh what is right.
019	PSA	037	031	The law of his God is in his heart; His footsteps shall not slip.
019	PSA	037	032	The wicked watcheth the righteous, And seeketh to slay him;
019	PSA	037	033	The Lord will not leave him in his hand, Nor suffer him to be condemned, when he is judged.
019	PSA	037	034	Trust in the LORD, and keep his way, And he will exalt thee to the possession of the land, Whilst thou shalt see the destruction of the wicked!
019	PSA	037	035	I have seen a wicked man in great power, And spreading himself like a green cedar;
019	PSA	037	036	But he passed away, and, lo! he was no more; Yea, I sought him, but he was not found.
019	PSA	037	037	Mark the righteous man, and behold the upright, That posterity is to the man of peace!
019	PSA	037	038	But transgressors will all be destroyed; The posterity of the wicked shall be rooted out.
019	PSA	037	039	The salvation of the just is from the LORD. He is their strength in the time of trouble.
019	PSA	037	040	The LORD will help and deliver them; He will deliver them from their enemies, and save them, Because they trust in him.
019	PSA	038	001	“A psalm of David. To bring to remembrance.” O LORD! rebuke me not in thy wrath, Nor chasten me in thy hot displeasure!
019	PSA	038	002	For thine arrows have deeply pierced me, And thy hand hath been heavy upon me.
019	PSA	038	003	There is no soundness in my flesh, because of thine anger; Nor rest in my bones, because of my sin.
019	PSA	038	004	For my iniquities have gone over my head; Like a heavy burden, they are more than I can bear.
019	PSA	038	005	My wounds putrefy and are loathsome on account of my folly.
019	PSA	038	006	I am bent; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long.
019	PSA	038	007	For my loins are full of burning heat, And there is no soundness in my flesh.
019	PSA	038	008	I am weakened and bruised exceedingly; I roar by reason of the disquietude of my heart.
019	PSA	038	009	O Lord! thou knowest all my desire, And my groaning is not hidden from thee!
019	PSA	038	010	My heart panteth; my strength faileth me; The very light of my eyes is gone from me.
019	PSA	038	011	My friends and acquaintance keep aloof from my woe, And my kinsmen stand afar off:
019	PSA	038	012	While they who seek my life lay snares for me; They who seek my hurt threaten destruction, And meditate deceit all the day long.
019	PSA	038	013	But I, like a deaf man, hear not; And, like a dumb man, open not my mouth.
019	PSA	038	014	I am like one who heareth nothing, And in whose mouth is no reply.
019	PSA	038	015	For in thee, O LORD! do I put my trust; Thou wilt hear, O Lord, my God!
019	PSA	038	016	For I have prayed, “Let them not rejoice over me; Let them not exult at the slipping of my feet!”
019	PSA	038	017	For I am ready to fall, And my pain doth never leave me;
019	PSA	038	018	For I confess my iniquity, And am troubled on account of my sin.
019	PSA	038	019	But my enemies flourish and are strong; They who hate me without cause are multiplied.
019	PSA	038	020	They who repay good with evil are my enemies, Because I follow that which is good.
019	PSA	038	021	Forsake me not, O LORD! O my God! be not far from me!
019	PSA	038	022	Make hast to mine aid, O Lord, my salvation!
019	PSA	039	001	“A psalm of David. For the leader of the music of the Jeduthunites.” I said, I will take heed to my ways, That I may not sin with my tongue; I will keep my mouth with a bridle, While the wicked is before me.
019	PSA	039	002	I was dumb with silence; I spake not even what was good; But my pain was increased.
019	PSA	039	003	My heart was hot within me; In my anguish the fire burst forth, And I spake with my tongue:
019	PSA	039	004	LORD, make me to know mine end, And the number of my days, That I may know how frail I am!
019	PSA	039	005	Behold, thou hast made my days as a hand-breadth, And my life is as nothing before thee; Yea, every man in his firmest state is altogether vanity. (Pause)
019	PSA	039	006	Surely every man walketh in a vain show; Surely he disquieteth himself in vain; He heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who shall gather them.
019	PSA	039	007	What, then, O Lord! is my hope? My hope is in thee!
019	PSA	039	008	Deliver me from all my transgressions; Let me not be the reproach of scoffers!
019	PSA	039	009	Yet I am dumb; I open not my mouth; For thou hast done it!
019	PSA	039	010	But remove from me thine infliction; For I am perishing by the blow of thine hand.
019	PSA	039	011	When thou with rebukes dost chasten man for iniquity, Thou causest his glory to waste away like a moth! Surely every man is vanity.
019	PSA	039	012	Hear my prayer, O LORD! Give ear to my cry; Be not silent at my tears! For I am but a stranger with thee, A sojourner, as all my fathers were.
019	PSA	039	013	O spare me, that I may recover strength, Before I go away, and be no more!
019	PSA	040	001	“For the leader of the music. A psalm of David.” I trusted steadfastly in the LORD, And he listened, and heard my cry.
019	PSA	040	002	He drew me out of a horrible pit, Out of the miry clay; He set my feet upon a rock, And made my steps firm.
019	PSA	040	003	He hath put into my mouth a new song, A song of praise to our God. Many shall see, and fear, And put their trust in the LORD.
019	PSA	040	004	Happy the man who maketh the LORD his trust, And resorteth not to men of pride and falsehood!
019	PSA	040	005	Many, O LORD, my God! are the wonderful works which thou hast done; Many have been thy gracious purposes towards us; None can be compared to thee! Would I declare and rehearse them, they are more than can be numbered.
019	PSA	040	006	In sacrifice and oblation thou hast no pleasure; Mine ears thou hast opened; Burnt-offering and sin-offering thou requirest not.
019	PSA	040	007	Therefore I said, “Lo, I come; In the scroll of the book it is prescribed to me;
019	PSA	040	008	O my God! to do thy will is my delight, And thy law dwelleth in my heart!”
019	PSA	040	009	I have proclaimed thy righteousness in the great assembly; Lo, I have not restrained my lips, O LORD! thou knowest!
019	PSA	040	010	I hide not thy justice in my heart; I declare thy faithfulness and thy salvation; I conceal not thy mercy and truth from the great assembly.
019	PSA	040	011	Withdraw not from me thy tender mercies, O LORD! May thy loving-kindness and thy truth continually preserve me!
019	PSA	040	012	For evils without number have encompassed me; My iniquities have overtaken me; I cannot see the end of them; They are more than the hairs of my head, And my heart dieth within me.
019	PSA	040	013	May it please thee, O LORD! to deliver me! O LORD! make haste to mine aid!
019	PSA	040	014	May they all be confounded and covered with shame Who seek to take away my life! Let them be driven back with disgrace Who desire to do me injury!
019	PSA	040	015	Let them be overwhelmed with confusion Who cry out to me, Aha! aha!
019	PSA	040	016	But let all who seek thee Be glad and rejoice in thee! Let those who love thy protection Ever say, “Great is Jehovah!”
019	PSA	040	017	I am poor and afflicted, yet the Lord thinketh upon me; Thou art my help and my deliverer; My God! make no delay!
019	PSA	041	001	“For the leader of the music. A psalm of David.” Happy is he who hath regard to the poor! The LORD will deliver him in time of trouble.
019	PSA	041	002	The LORD will preserve him, and keep him alive; He shall be happy on the earth; Thou wilt not give him up to the will of his enemies!
019	PSA	041	003	The LORD will strengthen him upon the bed of disease; All his bed thou wilt change in his sickness.
019	PSA	041	004	I said, O LORD! be merciful to me! Heal me, for I have sinned against thee!
019	PSA	041	005	My enemies speak evil of me: “When will he die, and his name perish?”
019	PSA	041	006	If one come to see me, he speaketh falsehood; His heart gathereth malice; When he goeth abroad, he uttereth it.
019	PSA	041	007	All that hate me whisper together against me; Against me do they devise mischief:
019	PSA	041	008	“A deadly disease cleaveth fast unto him; He lieth down, and he shall never arise!”
019	PSA	041	009	Yea, my familiar friend in whom I trusted, who did eat of my bread, —He hath lifted up his heel against me.
019	PSA	041	010	But do thou, O LORD! have pity upon me; Raise me up, that I may requite them!
019	PSA	041	011	By this I know that thou favorest me, Because my enemy doth not triumph over me.
019	PSA	041	012	As for me, thou wilt uphold me in my integrity; Thou wilt set me before thy face for ever!
019	PSA	041	013	[Praised be Jehovah, the God of Israel, From everlasting to everlasting. Amen! Amen!]
019	PSA	042	001	“BOOK II. For the leader of the music. A song of the sons of Korah.” As the hart panteth for the water-brooks, So panteth my soul for thee, O God!
019	PSA	042	002	My soul thirsteth for God, the living God: When shall I come, and appear before God?
019	PSA	042	003	My tears have been my food day and night, While they say to me continually, “Where is thy God?”
019	PSA	042	004	When I think of it, I pour out my soul in grief; How I once walked with the multitude, Walked slowly with them to the house of God, Amid sounds of joy and praise with the festive multitude!
019	PSA	042	005	Why art thou cast down, O my soul? And why art thou disquieted within me? Hope thou in God; for I shall yet praise him, Him, my deliverer and my God!
019	PSA	042	006	My soul is cast down within me, While I remember thee from the land of Jordan and Hermon, From the mountain Mizar.
019	PSA	042	007	Deep calleth for deep at the noise of thy waterfalls; All thy waves and billows have gone over me!
019	PSA	042	008	Once the LORD commanded his kindness by day, And by night his praise was with me, -Thanksgiving to the God of my life.
019	PSA	042	009	Now I say to God, my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me? Why go I mourning on account of the oppression of the enemy?
019	PSA	042	010	Like the crushing of my bones are the reproaches of the enemy, While they say to me continually, “Where is thy God?”
019	PSA	042	011	Why art thou cast down, O my soul? And why art thou disquieted within me? Hope thou in God; for I shall yet praise him, Him, my deliverer and my God!
019	PSA	043	001	Judge me, O God! and defend my cause against a merciless nation! Deliver me from unjust and deceitful men!
019	PSA	043	002	Thou art the God of my refuge: why dost thou cast me off? Why go I mourning on account of the oppression of the enemy?
019	PSA	043	003	O send forth thy light and thy truth; let them guide me; Let them lead me to thy holy mountain, and to thy dwelling-place!
019	PSA	043	004	Then will I go to the altar of God, To the God of my joy and exultation; Yea, upon the harp will I praise thee, O God, my God!
019	PSA	043	005	Why art thou cast down, O my soul? And why art thou disquieted within me? Hope thou in God; for I shall yet praise him, Him, my deliverer and my God!
019	PSA	044	001	“For the leader of the music. A psalm of the sons of Korah.” O God! we have heard with our ears, Our fathers have told us, What deeds thou didst in their days, In the days of old.
019	PSA	044	002	With thine own hand didst thou drive out the nations, And plant our fathers; Thou didst destroy the nations, And cause our fathers to flourish.
019	PSA	044	003	For not by their own swords did they gain possession of the land, Nor did their own arms give them victory; But thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance; For thou didst favor them!
019	PSA	044	004	Thou art my king, O God! O send deliverance to Jacob!
019	PSA	044	005	Through thee we may cast down our enemies; Through thy name we may trample upon our adversaries!
019	PSA	044	006	I trust not in my bow, Nor can my sword save me.
019	PSA	044	007	But it is thou only who savest us from our enemies, And puttest to shame those who hate us!
019	PSA	044	008	In God will we glory continually; Yea, we will praise thy name for ever! (Pause)
019	PSA	044	009	Yet now thou hast cast us off, and put us to shame; Thou goest not forth with our armies.
019	PSA	044	010	Thou makest us turn back from the enemy, And they who hate us make our goods their prey.
019	PSA	044	011	Thou makest us like sheep destined for food, And scatterest us among the nations.
019	PSA	044	012	Thou sellest thy people for nought, And increasest not thy wealth by their price.
019	PSA	044	013	Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbors, A scorn and a derision to those who are around us.
019	PSA	044	014	Thou makest us a byword among the nations, And causest the people to shake their heads at us.
019	PSA	044	015	My ignominy is continually before me, And shame covereth my face,
019	PSA	044	016	On account of the voice of the scoffer and the reviler, And on account of the enemy and the avenger.
019	PSA	044	017	All this hath come upon us; Yet have we not forgotten thee, Nor have we been false to thy covenant.
019	PSA	044	018	Our hearts, have not wandered from thee, Nor have our feet gone out of thy path;
019	PSA	044	019	Though thou hast crushed us in a land of jackals, And covered us with thick darkness.
019	PSA	044	020	If we had forgotten the name of our God, Or stretched forth our hands to a strange God,
019	PSA	044	021	Surely God would search it out; For he knoweth the secrets of the heart.
019	PSA	044	022	But for thy sake we are killed all the day; We are counted as sheep for the slaughter.
019	PSA	044	023	Awake! why sleepest thou, O Lord? Arise! cast us not off for ever!
019	PSA	044	024	Wherefore dost thou hide thy face, And forget our affliction and oppression?
019	PSA	044	025	Our soul is bowed down to the dust; Our body cleaveth to the earth.
019	PSA	044	026	Arise, O thou, our strength! And deliver us, for thy mercy's sake!
019	PSA	045	001	“For the leader of the music. To be accompanied with the Shoshannim. A song of loveliness by the sons of Korah.” My heart is overflowing with a good matter; I will address my work to the king: May my tongue be like the pen of a ready writer!
019	PSA	045	002	Thou art the fairest of the sons of men; Grace is poured upon thy lips; For God hath blessed thee for ever!
019	PSA	045	003	Gird thy sword to thy thigh, thou hero!-Thy glory and ornament!
019	PSA	045	004	In thy glorious array ride forth victoriously, On account of truth and mildness and justice; And thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things!
019	PSA	045	005	Thine arrows are sharp; Nations shall fall before thee; They shall pierce the hearts of the king's enemies.
019	PSA	045	006	Thy throne is God's for ever and ever; The sceptre of thy kingdom is a sceptre of equity!
019	PSA	045	007	Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest iniquity; Therefore hath God, thy God, anointed thee With the oil of gladness above thy fellows!
019	PSA	045	008	All thy garments are myrrh, aloes, and cassia; From ivory palaces stringed instruments delight thee.
019	PSA	045	009	Daughters of kings are among thy chosen women; On the right hand stands the queen In gold of Ophir.
019	PSA	045	010	Listen, O daughter! consider, and incline thine ear; Forget thy people and thy father's house!
019	PSA	045	011	For the king is captivated with thy beauty; He is now thy lord; honor thou him!
019	PSA	045	012	So shall the daughter of Tyre seek thy favor with gifts, The rich among the people.
019	PSA	045	013	All glorious is the king's daughter in her apartment; Her robe is embroidered with gold.
019	PSA	045	014	In variegated garments shall she be led to the king; The virgin companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee.
019	PSA	045	015	With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought; They shall enter the king's palace.
019	PSA	045	016	Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, Whom thou shalt make princes through all the land.
019	PSA	045	017	I will make thy name memorable throughout all generations; So shall the nations praise thee for ever and ever!
019	PSA	046	001	“For the leader of the music. Of, or for, the sons of Korah. To be sung in the manner, or with the voice, of virgins.” God is our refuge and strength; An ever present help in trouble.
019	PSA	046	002	Therefore will we not fear, though the earth be changed; Though the mountains tremble in the heart of the sea;
019	PSA	046	003	Though its waters roar and be troubled, And the mountains shake with the swelling thereof. (Pause)
019	PSA	046	004	A river with its streams shall make glad the city of God, The holy dwelling-place of the Most High.
019	PSA	046	005	God is the midst of her; she shall not be moved; God will help her, and that full early.
019	PSA	046	006	The nations raged; kingdoms were moved; He uttered his voice, the earth melted.
019	PSA	046	007	The LORD of hosts is with us; The God of Jacob is our refuge. (Pause)
019	PSA	046	008	Come, behold the doings of the LORD; What desolations he hath made in the earth!
019	PSA	046	009	He causeth wars to cease to the end of the earth; He hath broken the bow, and snapped the spear asunder, And burned the chariots in fire.
019	PSA	046	010	“Desist, and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted throughout the earth!”
019	PSA	046	011	The LORD of hosts is with us; The God of Jacob is our refuge.
019	PSA	047	001	“For the leader of the music. A psalm of the sons of Korah.” O clap your hands, all ye nations! Shout unto God with the voice of triumph!
019	PSA	047	002	For terrible is Jehovah, the Most High, The great king over all the earth.
019	PSA	047	003	He hath subdued nations under us, And kingdoms under our feet;
019	PSA	047	004	He hath chosen for us an inheritance, The glory of Jacob, whom he loved. (Pause)
019	PSA	047	005	God goeth up with a shout; Jehovah with the sound of the trumpet.
019	PSA	047	006	Sing praises to God, sing praises! Sing praises to our king, sing praises!
019	PSA	047	007	For God is king of all the earth; Sing to him hymns of praise!
019	PSA	047	008	God reigneth over the nations; God sitteth upon his holy throne.
019	PSA	047	009	The princes of the nations gather themselves together To the people of the God of Abraham; For the mighty of the earth belong to God; He is supremely exalted.
019	PSA	048	001	“A psalm of the sons of Korah.” Great is Jehovah, and greatly to be praised In the city of our God, upon his holy mountain.
019	PSA	048	002	Beautiful in its elevation is Mount Zion, The joy of the whole earth; The joy of the farthest North is the city of the great king;
019	PSA	048	003	In her palaces God is known as a refuge.
019	PSA	048	004	For, lo! kings were assembled against it; They passed away together.
019	PSA	048	005	As soon as they saw, they were astonished; They were confounded, and hasted away.
019	PSA	048	006	There terror seized upon them, —Pain, as of a woman in travail;
019	PSA	048	007	As when the east wind breaketh in pieces The ships of Tarshish.
019	PSA	048	008	As we have heard, so have we seen In the city of the LORD of hosts, in the city of our God; God will establish it for ever. (Pause)
019	PSA	048	009	We think of thy loving-kindness, O God! In the midst of thy temple!
019	PSA	048	010	As thy name, O God! so thy praise, extendeth to the ends of the earth; Thy right hand is full of righteousness.
019	PSA	048	011	Mount Zion rejoiceth, The daughters of Judah exult, On account of thy righteous judgments.
019	PSA	048	012	Go round about Zion; number her towers;
019	PSA	048	013	Mark well her bulwarks; count her palaces; That ye may tell it to the next generation!
019	PSA	048	014	For this God is our God for ever and ever; He will be our guide unto death.
019	PSA	049	001	“For the leader of the music. A psalm of the sons of Korah.” Hear this, all ye nations; Give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world;
019	PSA	049	002	Both high and low, rich and poor alike!
019	PSA	049	003	My mouth shall speak wisdom, And the meditation of my mind shall be understanding.
019	PSA	049	004	I will incline mine ear to a poem; I will utter my song upon the harp.
019	PSA	049	005	Why should I fear in the days of adversity, When the iniquity of my adversaries encompasseth me;
019	PSA	049	006	They who trust in their riches, And glory in the greatness of their wealth?
019	PSA	049	007	No one can redeem his brother from death, Nor give a ransom for him to God,
019	PSA	049	008	That he should live to eternity, And not see the pit.
019	PSA	049	009	Too costly is the redemption of his life, And he giveth it up for ever.
019	PSA	049	010	For he seeth that wise men die, As well as the foolish and the ignorant; They perish alike, And leave their wealth to others.
019	PSA	049	011	They imagine that their houses will endure for ever, And their dwelling-places from generation to generation: Men celebrate their names on the earth.
019	PSA	049	012	Yet man, who is in honor, abideth not; He is like the beasts that perish.
019	PSA	049	013	Such is the way which is their confidence! And they who come after them approve their maxims. (Pause)
019	PSA	049	014	Like sheep they are cast into the underworld; Death shall feed upon them; And the upright shall soon trample upon them. Their form shall be consumed in the underworld, And they shall no more have a dwelling-place.
019	PSA	049	015	But God will redeem my life from the underworld; Yea, he will take me under his care. (Pause)
019	PSA	049	016	Be not thou afraid, when one becometh rich; When the glory of his house is increased!
019	PSA	049	017	For, when he dieth, he will carry nothing away; His glory will not descend after him.
019	PSA	049	018	Though in his life he thought himself happy, —Though men praised thee, while thou wast in prosperity, —
019	PSA	049	019	Yet shalt thou go to the dwelling-place of thy fathers, Who never more shall see the light!
019	PSA	049	020	The man who is in honor, but without understanding, Is like the beasts that perish.
019	PSA	050	001	“A psalm of Asaph.” The mighty God, Jehovah, speaketh, and calleth the earth, From the rising of the sun to its going down.
019	PSA	050	002	Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God shineth forth.
019	PSA	050	003	Our God cometh, and will not be silent; Before him is a devouring fire, And around him a raging tempest.
019	PSA	050	004	He calleth to the heavens on high, And to the earth, while he judgeth his people:
019	PSA	050	005	“Gather together before me my godly ones, Who have made a covenant with me by sacrifice!”
019	PSA	050	006	(And the heavens shall declare his righteousness, For it is God himself that is judge., Pause)
019	PSA	050	007	“Hear, O my people, and I will speak! O Israel, and I will testify against thee! For I am God, thine own God.
019	PSA	050	008	I reprove thee not on account of thy sacrifices; For thy burnt-offerings are ever before me.
019	PSA	050	009	I will take no bullock from thy house, Nor he-goat from thy folds;
019	PSA	050	010	For all the beasts of the forest are mine, And the cattle on a thousand hills.
019	PSA	050	011	I know all the birds of the mountains, And the wild beasts of the field are before me.
019	PSA	050	012	If I were hungry, I would not tell thee; For the world is mine, and all that is therein.
019	PSA	050	013	Do I eat the flesh of bulls, Or drink the blood of goats?
019	PSA	050	014	Offer to God thanksgiving, And pay thy vows to the Most High!
019	PSA	050	015	Then call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me!”
019	PSA	050	016	And to the wicked God saith, “To what purpose dost thou talk of my statutes? And why hast thou my laws upon thy lips?—
019	PSA	050	017	Thou, who hatest instruction And castest my words behind thee!
019	PSA	050	018	When thou seest a thief, thou art in friendship with him, And hast fellowship with adulterers.
019	PSA	050	019	Thou lettest loose thy mouth to evil, And thy tongue frameth deceit;
019	PSA	050	020	Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother; Thou slanderest thine own mother's son.
019	PSA	050	021	These things hast thou done, and I kept silence; Hence thou thoughtest that I was altogether like thyself: But I will reprove thee, and set it in order before thine eyes.
019	PSA	050	022	Mark this, ye that forget God, Lest I tear you in pieces, and none deliver you!
019	PSA	050	023	Whoso offereth praise honoreth me; And to him who hath regard to his ways Will I show salvation from God.”
019	PSA	051	001	“For the leader of the music. A psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet came unto him, after his intercourse with Bathsheba.” Be gracious unto me, O God! according to thy loving kindness; According to the greatness of thy mercy, blot out my transgressions!
019	PSA	051	002	Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, And cleanse me from my sin!
019	PSA	051	003	For I acknowledge my transgressions, And my sin is ever before me.
019	PSA	051	004	Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, And in thy sight have I done evil; So that thou art just in thy sentence, And righteous in thy judgment.
019	PSA	051	005	Behold! I was born in iniquity, And in sin did my mother conceive me.
019	PSA	051	006	Behold! thou desirest truth in the heart; So teach me wisdom in my inmost soul!
019	PSA	051	007	Purge me with hyssop, until I be clean; Wash me, until I be whiter than snow!
019	PSA	051	008	Make me to hear joy and gladness, So that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice!
019	PSA	051	009	Hide thy face from my sins, And blot out all my iniquities!
019	PSA	051	010	Create within me a clean heart, O God! Renew within me a steadfast spirit!
019	PSA	051	011	Cast me not away from thy presence, And take not thy holy spirit from me!
019	PSA	051	012	Restore to me the joy of thy protection, And strengthen me with a willing spirit!
019	PSA	051	013	Then will I teach thy ways to transgressors, And sinners shall be converted to thee.
019	PSA	051	014	Deliver me from the guilt of blood, O God, the God of my salvation! That my tongue may sing aloud of thy goodness!
019	PSA	051	015	O Lord! open thou my lips, That my mouth may show forth thy praise!
019	PSA	051	016	For thou desirest not sacrifice, else would I give it; Thou delightest not in burnt-offerings.
019	PSA	051	017	The sacrifice which God loveth is a broken spirit; A broken and contrite heart, O God! thou wilt not despise!
019	PSA	051	018	Do good to Zion according to thy mercy; Build up the walls of Jerusalem!
019	PSA	051	019	Then shalt thou be pleased with sacrifices of righteousness, With burnt-offerings and complete offerings; Then shall bullocks be offered upon thine altar.
019	PSA	052	001	“For the leader of the music. A psalm of David, when Doeg, the Edomite, came and told Saul, and said to him, David is come to the house of Abimelech.” Why gloriest thou in mischief, thou man of violence? The goodness of God yet continueth daily.
019	PSA	052	002	Thy tongue deviseth mischief, Like a sharp razor, thou contriver of deceit!
019	PSA	052	003	Thou lovest evil more than good, And to lie more than to speak truth. (Pause)
019	PSA	052	004	Thou lovest all devouring words, O thou deceitful tongue!
019	PSA	052	005	Thee also shall God utterly destroy! o He shall seize thee, and tear thee from thy dwelling-place, And uproot thee from the land of the living. (Pause)
019	PSA	052	006	The righteous shall see and fear, And shall laugh at him.
019	PSA	052	007	“Behold the man that made not God his strength, But trusted in the abundance of his riches, And placed his strength in his wickedness!”
019	PSA	052	008	But I shall be like a green olive-tree in the house of God; I will trust in the goodness of God for ever and ever.
019	PSA	052	009	I will praise thee for ever for what thou hast done; I will trust in thy name, because it is good, Before the eyes of thy godly ones!
019	PSA	053	001	“For the leader of the music. To be sung on wind instruments. A psalm of David.” The fool saith in his heart, “There is no God!” They are corrupt; their doings are abominable; There is none that doeth good.
019	PSA	053	002	God looketh down from heaven upon the children of men, To see if there are any that have understanding, That have regard to God.
019	PSA	053	003	They are all gone astray; together are they corrupt; There is none that doeth good, no, not one.
019	PSA	053	004	Shall not the evil-doers be requited, Who eat up my people like bread, And call not upon God?
019	PSA	053	005	Yea! fear shall come upon them, Where no fear is; For God will scatter the bones of him that encampeth against thee; Thou shalt put them to shame, for God despiseth them!
019	PSA	053	006	O that salvation for Israel would come out of Zion! When God bringeth back the captives of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel be glad.
019	PSA	054	001	“For the leader of the music. To be sung on stringed instruments A psalm of David, when the Ziphites came and said to Saul, Doth not David hide himself with us?” Save me, O God! by thy name, And by thy strength defend my cause!
019	PSA	054	002	O God! hear my prayer, Give ear to the words of my mouth!
019	PSA	054	003	For enemies have risen up against me, And oppressors seek my life; They have not set God before their eyes. (Pause)
019	PSA	054	004	Behold! God is my helper; The Lord is the support of my life.
019	PSA	054	005	He will repay evil to my enemies; For thy truth's sake, O God! cut them off!
019	PSA	054	006	With a willing heart will I sacrifice to thee; I will praise thy name, O LORD! for it is good;
019	PSA	054	007	For thou hast delivered me from all trouble, So that my eye hath looked with joy upon my enemies!
019	PSA	055	001	“For the leader of the music. To be sung on stringed instruments. A psalm of David.” Give ear to my prayer, O God! Hide not thyself from my supplication!
019	PSA	055	002	Attend unto me, and hear me! I wander about mourning and wailing,
019	PSA	055	003	On account of the clamors of the enemy, On account of the violence of the wicked. For they bring evil upon me, And in wrath set themselves against me.
019	PSA	055	004	My heart trembleth in my bosom, And the terrors of death have fallen upon me.
019	PSA	055	005	Fear and trembling have seized me, And horror hath overwhelmed me.
019	PSA	055	006	Then I say, O that I had wings like a dove! For then would I fly away, and be at rest.
019	PSA	055	007	Behold, I would wander far away, And take up my abode in a wilderness. (Pause)
019	PSA	055	008	I would hasten away to a shelter From the rushing wind and tempest.
019	PSA	055	009	Confound, O Lord! divide their counsels! For I behold violence and strife in the city.
019	PSA	055	010	Day and night do these go about its walls; In the midst of it are iniquity and mischief.
019	PSA	055	011	Wickedness is in the midst of it; Oppression and fraud depart not from its streets.
019	PSA	055	012	It was not an enemy that reviled me, Then I could have borne it; Nor one that hated me, who rose up against me; From him I could have hid myself.
019	PSA	055	013	But it was thou, a man my equal, My friend, and my acquaintance.
019	PSA	055	014	We held sweet converse together, And walked to the house of God in company.
019	PSA	055	015	May sudden death seize upon them! May they go down to the underworld alive! For wickedness is in their dwellings, in the midst of them.
019	PSA	055	016	As for me, I will call upon God, And Jehovah will save me.

019	PSA	055	019	God will hear me, and bring them down, —He that hath been judge of old. (Pause) Because they have no changes, Therefore they fear not God.
019	PSA	055	020	They lift up their hands against their friend, And break their covenant with him.
019	PSA	055	021	Their speech was softer than butter, But war was in their heart; Their words were smoother than oil, Yet were they drawn swords.

019	PSA	056	003	When I am in fear, I will put my trust in thee!
019	PSA	056	004	Through God shall I praise his word; In God do I put my trust; I will not fear; What can flesh do to me?
019	PSA	056	005	Every day they wrest my words; All their thoughts are against me for evil.
019	PSA	056	006	They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, they watch my steps, Lying in wait for my life.

019	PSA	057	002	I call upon God the Most High, Upon God, who performeth all things for me;
019	PSA	057	003	He will send from heaven, and save me; He will put to shame him that panteth for my life; (Pause) God will send forth his mercy and his truth.
019	PSA	057	004	My life is in the midst of lions; I dwell among them that breathe out fire; Among men whose teeth are spears and arrows, And whose tongue is a sharp sword.
019	PSA	057	005	Exalt thyself, O God! above the heavens, And thy glory above all the earth!
019	PSA	057	006	They have prepared a net for my steps; My soul is bowed down; They have digged a pit before me, But into it they have themselves fallen.

019	PSA	058	002	Nay, in your hearts ye contrive iniquity; Your hands weigh out violence in the land!
019	PSA	058	003	The wicked are estranged, from their very birth; The liars go astray as soon as they are born.
019	PSA	058	004	They have poison, like the poison of a serpent; Like the deaf adder's, which stoppeth her ear;
019	PSA	058	005	Which listeneth not to the voice of the charmer, And of the sorcerer, skilful in incantations.
019	PSA	058	006	Break their teeth, O God! in their mouths! Break out the great teeth of the lions, O LORD!
019	PSA	058	007	May they melt like waters, which flow away; May their arrows, when they aim them, be as if cut in pieces!
019	PSA	058	008	May they be like the snail, which melteth away as it goeth; Like the abortion of a woman, that seeth not the sun!

019	PSA	059	004	Without any offence of mine, they run and prepare themselves; Awake to help me, and behold!
019	PSA	059	005	Do thou, O Jehovah, God of hosts, God of Israel, Awake to punish all the nations! Show no mercy to any wicked transgressors! (Pause)
019	PSA	059	006	Let them return at evening, Let them howl like dogs, And go round about the city!
019	PSA	059	007	Behold! with their mouths they belch out malice; Swords are upon their lips; “For who,” say they, “will hear?”
019	PSA	059	008	Yet thou, O LORD! wilt laugh at them; Thou wilt hold all the nations in derision!
019	PSA	059	009	O my Strength! to thee will I look! For God is my defence;

019	PSA	059	011	Slay them not, lest my people forget; Scatter them by thy power, and cast them down, O Lord, our shield!
019	PSA	059	012	The word of their lips is the sin of their mouth; Let them be overtaken in their pride, For the curses and the falsehood which they utter!
019	PSA	059	013	Consume them in thy wrath; consume them that they be no more, That they may know that God ruleth in Jacob, Even to the ends of the earth! (Pause)
019	PSA	059	014	Let them return at evening, Let them howl like dogs, And go round about the city!
019	PSA	059	015	Let them wander about for food, When they have passed the night unsatisfied!
019	PSA	059	016	But I will sing of thy power; Yea, in the morning will I sing aloud of thy mercy; For thou hast been my defence, My refuge in the day of my distress.
019	PSA	059	017	To thee, O my Strength! will I sing! For God is my defence; a God of mercy to me.

019	PSA	060	007	Gilead shall be mine, and mine Manasseh; Ephraim shall be my helmet, And Judah my sceptre;
019	PSA	060	008	Moab shall be my wash-bowl; Upon Edom shall I cast my shoe; I shall triumph over Philistia!
019	PSA	060	009	Who will bring me to the strong city? Who will lead me into Edom?
019	PSA	060	010	Wilt not thou, O God! who didst forsake us, And didst not go forth with our armies?
019	PSA	060	011	Give us thine aid in our distress, For vain is the help of man!
019	PSA	060	012	Through God we shall do valiantly; For he will tread down our enemies.
019	PSA	061	001	“For the leader of the music. To be sung upon stringed instruments. A psalm of David.” Hear my cry, O God! Attend to my prayer!
019	PSA	061	002	From the extremity of the land I cry unto thee in deep sorrow of heart; Lead me to the rock that is high above me!
019	PSA	061	003	For thou art my refuge, My strong tower against the enemy.
019	PSA	061	004	I shall dwell in thy tabernacle for ever; I will seek refuge under the covert of thy wings.
019	PSA	061	005	For thou, O God! wilt hear my vows, And give me the inheritance of those who fear thy name.

019	PSA	061	007	May he reign for ever before God! Grant that mercy and truth may preserve him!
019	PSA	061	008	So will I sing praise to thy name for ever; I will daily perform my vows.
019	PSA	062	001	“For the leader of the music of the Jeduthunites, A psalm of David.” Truly my soul resteth on God alone; From him cometh my deliverance!
019	PSA	062	002	He alone is my rock and my salvation; He is my safeguard, I shall not wholly fall!
019	PSA	062	003	How long will ye continue to assault a single man? How long will ye all seek to destroy me, Like a bending wall, or a tottering fence?
019	PSA	062	004	They study how to cast me down from my eminence; They delight in falsehood; They bless with their mouths, but in their hearts they curse.
019	PSA	062	005	My soul, rest thou on God alone, For from him cometh my hope!
019	PSA	062	006	He alone is my rock and my salvation; He is my safeguard, —I shall not fall.
019	PSA	062	007	From God cometh my help and my glory: My strong rock, my refuge, is God.
019	PSA	062	008	Trust in him at all times, ye people! Pour out your hearts before him! God is our refuge!
019	PSA	062	009	Truly men of low degree are vanity, And men of high degree are a lie; Placed in the balance, They are all lighter than vanity.
019	PSA	062	010	Trust not in extortion; Place no vain hopes in rapine! If riches increase, set not your heart upon them!
019	PSA	062	011	Once hath God promised, twice have I heard it, That power belongeth unto God.
019	PSA	062	012	To thee also, O Lord! belongeth mercy; For thou dost render to every man according to his work!
019	PSA	063	001	“A psalm of David, when he was in the wilderness of Judah.” O God! thou art my God! earnestly do I seek thee! My soul thirsteth, my flesh longeth for thee, In a dry, thirsty land. where is no water!
019	PSA	063	002	Thus I look toward thee in thy sanctuary, To behold thy power and thy glory!
019	PSA	063	003	For thy loving-kindness is better than life; Therefore my lips shall praise thee!
019	PSA	063	004	Thus will I bless thee, while I live; In thy name will I lift up my hands!
019	PSA	063	005	My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness, And with joyful lips my mouth shall praise thee,
019	PSA	063	006	When I think of thee upon my bed, And meditate on thee in the night-watches.
019	PSA	063	007	For thou art my help, And in the shadow of thy wings I rejoice.
019	PSA	063	008	My soul cleaveth to thee; Thy right hand holdeth me up.
019	PSA	063	009	While they who seek to destroy my life Shall themselves go down into the depths of the earth.
019	PSA	063	010	They shall be given up to the sword, And be a portion for jackals.
019	PSA	063	011	But the king shall rejoice in God; All that swear by him shall be honored; But the mouth of liars shall be stopped.
019	PSA	064	001	“For the leader of the music. A psalm of David.” Hear my voice, O God! when I pray! Preserve my life from the terrors of the enemy!
019	PSA	064	002	Hide me from the assembly of the wicked, From the brawling crowd of evil-doers!
019	PSA	064	003	For like a sword they sharpen their tongues, Like arrows they aim their poisoned words,
019	PSA	064	004	To shoot in secret at the upright; Suddenly do they shoot at him without fear.
019	PSA	064	005	They prepare themselves for an evil deed; They commune of laying secret snares: “Who,” say they, “will see them?”
019	PSA	064	006	They meditate crimes: “We have finished,” say they, “our plans!” The heart and bosom of every one of them are deep.
019	PSA	064	007	But God will shoot an arrow at them; Suddenly shall they be wounded.
019	PSA	064	008	Thus their own tongues shall bring them down; All who see them will flee away.
019	PSA	064	009	Then will all men stand in awe, And declare what God hath done, And attentively consider his work.
019	PSA	064	010	The righteous shall rejoice, and trust in the LORD; All the upright in heart shall glory.
019	PSA	065	001	“For the leader of the music. A psalm of David.” To thee belongeth trust, to thee praise, O God in Zion! And to thee shall the vow be performed!
019	PSA	065	002	O Thou that hearest prayer! To thee shall all flesh come!
019	PSA	065	003	My iniquities are heavy upon me; But thou wilt forgive our transgressions!
019	PSA	065	004	Happy is he whom thou choosest, And bringest near thee to dwell in thy courts! May we be satisfied with the blessings of thy house, Thy holy temple!
019	PSA	065	005	By wonderful deeds dost thou answer us in thy goodness, O God, our salvation! Who art the confidence of all the ends of the earth, And of the most distant seas!
019	PSA	065	006	Thou makest fast the mountains by thy power, Being girded with strength!
019	PSA	065	007	Thou stillest the roar of the sea, The roar of its waves, And the tumult of the nations.
019	PSA	065	008	They who dwell in the ends of the earth are awed by thy signs; Thou makest the outgoings of the morning and of the evening to rejoice!
019	PSA	065	009	Thou visitest the earth and waterest it; Thou enrichest it exceedingly; The river of God is full of water. Thou suppliest the earth with corn, When thou hast thus prepared it.
019	PSA	065	010	Thou waterest its furrows, And breakest down its ridges; Thou makest it soft with showers, And blessest its increase.
019	PSA	065	011	Thou crownest the year with thy goodness; Thy footsteps drop fruitfulness;
019	PSA	065	012	They drop it upon the pastures of the wilderness, And the hills are girded with gladness.
019	PSA	065	013	The pastures are clothed with flocks, And the valleys are covered with corn; They shout, yea, they sing for joy.
019	PSA	066	001	“For the leader of the music. A psalm.” Shout joyfully unto God. all ye lands!
019	PSA	066	002	Sing ye the honor of his name; Make his praise glorious!
019	PSA	066	003	Say unto God, How terrible are thy doings! Through the greatness of thy power thine enemies are suppliants to thee!
019	PSA	066	004	Let all the earth worship thee; Let it sing praise to thee, let it sing praise to thy name! (Pause)
019	PSA	066	005	Come, behold the works of God! How terrible his doings among the sons of men!
019	PSA	066	006	He turned the sea into dry land; They went through the deep on foot; Then we rejoiced in him.
019	PSA	066	007	By his power he ruleth for ever; His eyes are fixed upon the nations; Let not the rebellious exalt themselves! (Pause)
019	PSA	066	008	O bless our God, ye nations. And make the voice of his praise to be heard!
019	PSA	066	009	It is he who preserveth our lives, And suffereth not our feet to stumble.
019	PSA	066	010	Thou hast, indeed, proved us, O God! Thou hast tried us as silver is tried.
019	PSA	066	011	Thou broughtest us into a snare, And didst lay a heavy burden upon our backs;
019	PSA	066	012	Thou didst cause men to ride upon our heads, And we have gone through fire and water: But thou hast brought us to a place of abundance.
019	PSA	066	013	I will go into thy house with burnt-offerings! I will pay thee my vows, —
019	PSA	066	014	The vows which my lips uttered. Which my mouth promised in my trouble.
019	PSA	066	015	Burnt sacrifices of fatlings will I offer to thee with the fat of rams; Bullocks, with he-goats, will I sacrifice to thee. (Pause)
019	PSA	066	016	Come and hear, all ye who fear God, And I will relate what he hath done for me!
019	PSA	066	017	I called upon him with my mouth, And praise is now upon my tongue.
019	PSA	066	018	If I had meditated wickedness in my heart, The Lord would not have heard me:
019	PSA	066	019	But surely God hath heard me; He hath had regard to the voice of my supplication.
019	PSA	066	020	Blessed be God, who did not reject my prayer, Nor withhold his mercy from me!
019	PSA	067	001	“For the leader of the music. To be sung on stringed instruments. A psalm.” O God! be merciful to us, and bless us, And cause thy face to shine upon us! (Pause)
019	PSA	067	002	That thy doings may be known on earth, And thy saving power to all the nations.
019	PSA	067	003	Let the nations praise thee, O God! Yea, let all the nations praise thee!

019	PSA	068	002	As smoke is dispersed, so thou dispersest them; As wax melteth before the fire, So perish the wicked before the face of God.
019	PSA	068	003	But the righteous are glad and rejoice in his presence, Yea, they exult exceedingly.
019	PSA	068	004	Sing unto God; sing praises to his name! Prepare a way for him who rideth through the desert! Jehovah is his name; be joyful in his presence!
019	PSA	068	005	The father of the fatherless, and the protector of the widow, Is God in his holy habitation.
019	PSA	068	006	God causeth the forsaken to dwell in houses; He leadeth forth to prosperity them that are bound; But the rebellious shall dwell in a barren land.
019	PSA	068	007	O God! when thou didst go before thy people, When thou didst march through the wilderness. (Pause)
019	PSA	068	008	The earth quaked, and the heavens dropped at the presence of God; This Sinai trembled at the presence of God, the God of Israel.
019	PSA	068	009	Thou, O God! didst send a plentiful rain; Thou didst strengthen thy wearied inheritance.
019	PSA	068	010	Thy people established themselves in the land; Thou, O God! in thy goodness, didst prepare it for the needy!
019	PSA	068	011	The Lord gave the song of victory Of the maidens publishing glad tidings to the mighty host.
019	PSA	068	012	“The kings with their armies have fled, —have fled! And the matron at home divideth the spoil.
019	PSA	068	013	Truly ye may repose yourselves in the stalls, Like the wings of a dove covered with silver, And her feathers with shining gold.”
019	PSA	068	014	When the Most High destroyed the kings in the land, It was white [[with their bones]] like Salmon.
019	PSA	068	015	Ye lofty hills, ye hills of Bashan, Ye many-topped hills, ye hills of Bashan,
019	PSA	068	016	Why frown ye, ye many-topped hills, At the hill in which God is pleased to dwell, In which Jehovah will dwell for ever?
019	PSA	068	017	The chariots of God are myriads, yea, thousands of thousands; The Lord is in the midst of them, as upon Sinai, in the sanctuary.
019	PSA	068	018	Thou hast ascended on high, Thou hast led captive the vanquished, Thou hast received gifts among men, Even the rebellious, that here thou mightst dwell, O LORD God!
019	PSA	068	019	Praised be the Lord daily! When we are heavy-laden, the Mighty One is our help.
019	PSA	068	020	Our God is a God of salvation; From the Lord Jehovah cometh deliverance from death.
019	PSA	068	021	But God smiteth the head of his enemies, Even the hairy crowns of those who go on in their iniquity.
019	PSA	068	022	“I will bring them back,” saith the Lord, “from Bashan; I will bring them back from the deep sea;
019	PSA	068	023	That thy foot may be dipped in their blood, That thy dogs may drink the blood of thine enemies.”
019	PSA	068	024	We have seen thy procession, O God! The procession of my God, my king, to his sanctuary!
019	PSA	068	025	The singers go before, the minstrels follow, Amidst damsels playing on timbrels.
019	PSA	068	026	Praise ye God in your assemblies; Praise the Lord, all ye from the fountain of Israel!
019	PSA	068	027	Here is Benjamin, the youngest, and his leaders; The chiefs of Judah, and their band; The chiefs of Zebulon, and the chiefs of Naphtali.
019	PSA	068	028	Thy God has ordained thy strength, [[O Israel!]] Show forth thy might, O God! thou who hast wrought for us!
019	PSA	068	029	Because of thy temple in Jerusalem Shall kings bring presents to thee.
019	PSA	068	030	Rebuke the wild beast of the reeds, The multitude of bulls with the calves of the nations, So that they shall cast themselves down with masses of silver; Scatter thou the nations that delight in war!
019	PSA	068	031	Princes shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall haste with outstretched hands to God.
019	PSA	068	032	Ye kingdoms of the earth, sing unto God; Sing praises to Jehovah;
019	PSA	068	033	To him who rideth upon the ancient heaven of heavens! Behold, he uttereth his voice, his mighty voice!
019	PSA	068	034	Give glory to God, Whose majesty is in Israel, and whose might is in the clouds!
019	PSA	068	035	Terrible art thou, O God! from thy sanctuary! The God of Israel giveth strength and power to his people. Praised be God!
019	PSA	069	001	“For the leader of the music. Upon the Shoshannim. A psalm of David.” Save me, O God! For the waters press in to my very life!
019	PSA	069	002	I sink in deep mire, where is no standing; I have come into deep waters, and the waves flow over me.
019	PSA	069	003	I am weary with crying; my throat is parched; Mine eyes are wasted, while I wait for my God.
019	PSA	069	004	More numerous than the hairs of my head are they who hate me without reason; Mighty are they who seek to destroy me, being my enemies without cause: I must restore what I took not away.
019	PSA	069	005	O God! thou knowest my offences, And my sins are not hidden from thee!
019	PSA	069	006	Let not them that trust in thee through me be put to shame, O Lord Jehovah, God of hosts! Let not them that seek thee through me be confounded, O God of Israel!
019	PSA	069	007	For on account of thee do I suffer reproach, And shame covereth my face!
019	PSA	069	008	I am become a stranger to my brothers; Yea, an alien to my mother's sons.
019	PSA	069	009	For zeal for thy house consumeth me, And the reproaches of them that reproach thee fall upon me.
019	PSA	069	010	When I weep and fast, That is made my reproach;
019	PSA	069	011	When I clothe myself in sackcloth, Then I become their by-word.
019	PSA	069	012	They who sit in the gate speak against me, And I am become the song of drunkards.
019	PSA	069	013	Yet will I address my prayer to thee, O LORD! May it be in an acceptable time according to thy great goodness! Hear, O God! and afford me thy sure help!
019	PSA	069	014	Save me from the mire, and let me not sink; May I be delivered from my enemies, —from the deep waters!
019	PSA	069	015	Let not the water-flood overflow me; Let not the deep swallow me up, And let not the pit close her mouth upon me!
019	PSA	069	016	Hear me, O LORD! since great is thy loving-kindness; According to the abundance of thy tender mercies look upon me!
019	PSA	069	017	Hide not thy face from thy servant; I am greatly distressed, O make haste to mine aid!
019	PSA	069	018	Draw near to me, and redeem my life; Deliver me because of my enemies!
019	PSA	069	019	Thou knowest my reproach, and dishonor, and shame; All my adversaries are in thy view!
019	PSA	069	020	Reproach hath broken my heart, and I am full of heaviness; I look for pity, but there is none; For comforters, but find none.
019	PSA	069	021	For my food they give me gall, And in my thirst they give me vinegar to drink.
019	PSA	069	022	May their table be to them a snare; May it be a trap to them, while they are at ease!
019	PSA	069	023	May their eyes be darkened, that they may not see; And cause their loins continually to shake!
019	PSA	069	024	Pour out upon them thine indignation, And may the heat of thine anger overtake them!
019	PSA	069	025	Let their habitation be desolate, And let none dwell in their tents!
019	PSA	069	026	For they persecute those whom thou hast smitten, And talk of the pain of those whom thou hast wounded.
019	PSA	069	027	Add iniquity to their iniquity, And let them never come into thy favor!
019	PSA	069	028	Let them be blotted out of the book of the living; Let not their names be written with the righteous!
019	PSA	069	029	But I am poor, and sorrowful: May thine aid, O God! set me on high!
019	PSA	069	030	Then I will praise the name of God in a song; I will give glory to him with thanksgiving.
019	PSA	069	031	More pleasing shall this be to the LORD Than a full-horned and full-hoofed bullock.
019	PSA	069	032	The afflicted shall see, and rejoice; The hearts of them that fear God shall be revived.
019	PSA	069	033	For the LORD heareth the poor, And despiseth not his people in their bonds.
019	PSA	069	034	Let the heaven and the earth praise him; The sea, and all that move therein!
019	PSA	069	035	For God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah, That they may dwell therein, and possess it.
019	PSA	069	036	Yea, the posterity of his servants shall possess it, And they that love him shall dwell therein.
019	PSA	070	001	“For the leader of the music. A psalm of David, for remembrance.” Make haste, O God! to deliver me, O LORD! come speedily to mine aid!
019	PSA	070	002	May they all be confounded, and covered with shame, Who seek to take my life! May they be driven back with disgrace Who desire to do me injury!
019	PSA	070	003	May they be turned back with shame Who cry out to me, “Aha! aha!”
019	PSA	070	004	But let all who seek thee be glad and rejoice in thee! Let them that love thy protection ever say, “May God be praised!”
019	PSA	070	005	But I am poor and needy; O God! hasten to mine aid! Thou art my help and my deliverer, O LORD! make no delay!
019	PSA	071	001	In thee, O LORD! do I put my trust! Let me never be put to shame!
019	PSA	071	002	In thy goodness deliver and rescue me; Incline thine ear to me, and save me!
019	PSA	071	003	Be thou the rock of my abode, where I may continually resort! Thou hast granted me deliverance; For thou art my rock and my fortress!
019	PSA	071	004	Save me, O my God! from the hand of the wicked, -From the hand of the unjust and cruel!
019	PSA	071	005	For thou art my hope, O Lord Jehovah! Thou hast been my trust from my youth!
019	PSA	071	006	Upon thee have I leaned from my birth; From my earliest breath thou hast been my support; My song hath been continually of thee!
019	PSA	071	007	I am a wonder to many, But thou art my strong refuge.
019	PSA	071	008	Let my mouth be filled with thy praise; Yea, all the day long, with thy glory.
019	PSA	071	009	Cast me not off in mine old age; Forsake me not, When my strength faileth!
019	PSA	071	010	For my enemies speak against me, And they who lay wait for my life consult together:
019	PSA	071	011	“God,” say they, “hath forsaken him; Pursue and seize him; for he hath none to deliver him!”
019	PSA	071	012	O God! be not far from me! Come speedily to mine aid, O my God!
019	PSA	071	013	Let them perish with shame who are my enemies; Let them be covered with contempt and dishonor who seek my hurt!
019	PSA	071	014	But I will hope continually; I shall yet praise thee more and more.
019	PSA	071	015	My mouth shall speak of thy goodness, —Of thy sure protection all the day long; For thy mercies are more than I can number.
019	PSA	071	016	I will celebrate thy mighty deeds, O Lord Jehovah! I will make mention of thy goodness, of thine only!
019	PSA	071	017	O God! thou hast taught me from my youth, And thus far have I declared thy wondrous deeds;
019	PSA	071	018	And now, when I am old and gray-headed, O God! forsake me not, Until I make known thine arm to the next generation, -Thy mighty power to all that are to come!
019	PSA	071	019	For thy goodness, O God! reacheth to the heavens; Wonderful things doest thou! O God! who is like unto thee?
019	PSA	071	020	Thou hast suffered us to see great and grievous troubles; Thou wilt again give us life, And wilt bring us back from the depths of the earth!
019	PSA	071	021	Thou wilt increase my greatness; Thou wilt again comfort me!
019	PSA	071	022	Then will I praise thee with the psaltery; Even thy faithfulness, O my God! To thee will I sing with the harp, O Holy One of Israel!
019	PSA	071	023	My lips shall rejoice, when I sing to thee; And my soul, which thou hast redeemed from death;
019	PSA	071	024	My tongue also shall continually speak of thy righteousness: For all who seek my hurt are brought to shame and confounded.
019	PSA	072	001	“For Solomon.” To the king, O God! give thy justice, And to the son of a king thy righteousness!
019	PSA	072	002	Yea! he shall judge thy people with equity, And thine oppressed ones with justice.
019	PSA	072	003	For the mountains shall bring forth peace to the people, And the hills, through righteousness.
019	PSA	072	004	He shall defend the oppressed of the people; He shall save the needy, And break in pieces the oppressor.
019	PSA	072	005	They shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon shall endure, From generation to generation.
019	PSA	072	006	He shall be like rain descending on the mown field, —Like showers which water the earth.
019	PSA	072	007	In his days shall the righteous flourish, And great shall be their prosperity, as long as the moon shall endure.
019	PSA	072	008	He shall have dominion from sea to sea, And from the river to the ends of the earth.
019	PSA	072	009	They that dwell in the desert shall bow before him, And his enemies shall lick the dust.
019	PSA	072	010	The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents; The kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts;
019	PSA	072	011	Yea, all kings shall fall down before him; All nations shall serve him.
019	PSA	072	012	For he shall deliver the poor who crieth for aid, And the oppressed who hath no helper.
019	PSA	072	013	He shall spare the weak and needy, And save the lives of the poor.
019	PSA	072	014	He shall redeem them from deceit and violence, And their blood shall be precious in his sight.
019	PSA	072	015	He shall prosper, and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba; Prayer also shall be made for him continually, And daily shall he be praised.
019	PSA	072	016	There shall be an abundance of corn in the land; Its fruit shall shake like Lebanon, even on the tops of the mountains; And they of the cities shall flourish as the grass of the earth.
019	PSA	072	017	His name shall endure for ever; His name shall be continued as long as the sun. By him shall men bless themselves; All nations shall call him blessed.
019	PSA	072	018	[[Praised be God, Jehovah, the God of Israel, Who alone doeth wonderful things!
019	PSA	072	019	Praised be his glorious name for ever! May his glory fill the whole earth! Amen, Amen!
019	PSA	072	020	Here end the Psalms of David, the son of Jesse.]]
019	PSA	073	001	“BOOK III. A psalm of Asaph.” Truly God is good to Israel, —To those who are pure in heart.
019	PSA	073	002	Yet my feet almost gave way; My steps had well nigh slipped:
019	PSA	073	003	For I was envious of the proud, When I saw the prosperity of the wicked.
019	PSA	073	004	For they have no pains even to their death; Their bodies are in full health.
019	PSA	073	005	They have not the woes of other men, Neither are they smitten like other men.
019	PSA	073	006	Therefore pride encircleth their neck as a collar; Violence covereth them as a garment.
019	PSA	073	007	From their bosom issueth their iniquity; The designs of their hearts burst forth.
019	PSA	073	008	They mock, and speak of malicious oppression; Their words are haughty;
019	PSA	073	009	They stretch forth their mouth to the heavens, And their tongue goeth through the earth;
019	PSA	073	010	Therefore his people walk in their ways, And there drink from full fountains.
019	PSA	073	011	And they say, “How doth God know? How can there be knowledge with the Most High?”
019	PSA	073	012	Behold these are the ungodly! Yet they are ever prosperous; they heap up riches.
019	PSA	073	013	Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain; In vain have I washed my hands in innocence.
019	PSA	073	014	For every day have I been smitten; Every morn have I been chastened.
019	PSA	073	015	If I should resolve to speak like them, Surely I should be treacherous to the family of thy children.
019	PSA	073	016	So, when I studied to know this, It was painful to my eyes;
019	PSA	073	017	Until I went into the sanctuaries of God, And considered what was their end.
019	PSA	073	018	Behold! thou hast set them on slippery places; Thou castest them down into unseen pits.
019	PSA	073	019	How are they brought to desolation in a moment, And utterly consumed with sudden destruction!
019	PSA	073	020	As a dream when one awaketh, Thou, O Lord! when thou awakest, wilt make their vain show a derision.
019	PSA	073	021	When my heart was vexed And I was pierced in my reins,
019	PSA	073	022	Then was I stupid and without understanding; I was like one of the brutes before thee.
019	PSA	073	023	Yet am I ever under thy care; By my right hand thou dost hold me up.
019	PSA	073	024	Thou wilt guide me with thy counsel, And at last receive me in glory.
019	PSA	073	025	Whom have I in heaven but thee, And whom on earth do I love in comparison with thee?
019	PSA	073	026	Though my flesh and my heart fail, God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.
019	PSA	073	027	For, lo! they who are far from thee perish; Thou destroyest all who estrange themselves from thee.
019	PSA	073	028	But it is good for me to draw near to God; I put my trust in the Lord Jehovah, That I may declare all thy works.
019	PSA	074	001	“A psalm of Asaph.” O God! why hast thou cast us off for ever? Why doth thine anger smoke against the flock of thy pasture?
019	PSA	074	002	Remember the people which thou didst purchase of old; Thine own inheritance, which thou didst redeem; That Mount Zion, where thou once didst dwell!
019	PSA	074	003	Hasten thy steps to those utter desolations! Every thing in the sanctuary hath the enemy abused!
019	PSA	074	004	Thine enemies roar in the place of thine assemblies; Their own symbols have they set up for signs.
019	PSA	074	005	They appear like those who raise the axe against a thicket;
019	PSA	074	006	They have broken down the carved work of thy temple with axes and hammers;
019	PSA	074	007	They have cast fire into thy sanctuary; They have profaned, and cast to the ground, the dwelling-place of thy name.
019	PSA	074	008	They said in their hearts, “Let us destroy them all together!” They have burned all God's places of assembly in the land.
019	PSA	074	009	We no longer see our signs; There is no prophet among us, Nor any one that knoweth how long this desolation shall endure.
019	PSA	074	010	How long, O God! shall the adversary revile? Shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever?
019	PSA	074	011	Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right hand? Take it from thy bosom, and destroy!
019	PSA	074	012	Yet God was our king of old, Working salvation in the midst of the earth.
019	PSA	074	013	Thou didst divide the sea by thy power; Thou didst crush the heads of the sea-monsters in the waters.
019	PSA	074	014	Thou didst break in pieces the head of the crocodile; Thou gavest him for food to the inhabitants of the desert.
019	PSA	074	015	Thou didst cleave forth the fountain and the stream; Thou didst dry up perennial rivers.
019	PSA	074	016	Thine is the day, and thine the night; Thou didst prepare the light and the sun.
019	PSA	074	017	Thou didst establish all the boundaries of the earth; Thou didst make summer and winter.
019	PSA	074	018	O remember that the enemy hath reviled Jehovah; That an impious people hath blasphemed thy name!
019	PSA	074	019	Give not up the life of thy turtle-dove to the wild beast; Forget not for ever thine afflicted people!
019	PSA	074	020	Have regard to thy covenant! For all the dark places of the land are full of the abodes of cruelty.
019	PSA	074	021	O let not the afflicted go away ashamed! Let the poor and needy praise thy name!
019	PSA	074	022	Arise, O God! maintain thy cause! Remember how the impious revileth thee daily!
019	PSA	074	023	Forget not the clamor of thine adversaries, —The noise of thine enemies, which continually increaseth!
019	PSA	075	001	“For the leader of the music. To the tune of “Do not destroy.” A psalm of Asaph.” We give thanks to thee, O God! we give thanks to thee, and near is thy name; Men shall declare thy wondrous deeds!
019	PSA	075	002	“When I see my time, Then will I judge with equity.
019	PSA	075	003	The earth trembleth, and all her inhabitants; But I uphold her pillars.”
019	PSA	075	004	I say to the proud, Behave not proudly! To the wicked, Lift not up your horn!
019	PSA	075	005	Lift not up your horn on high, And speak not with a stiff neck!
019	PSA	075	006	For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south;
019	PSA	075	007	But it is God that judgeth; He putteth down one, and setteth up another.
019	PSA	075	008	For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup; The wine is foaming and full of spices, And of it he poureth out; Even to the dregs shall all the wicked of the earth drink it.
019	PSA	075	009	Therefore I will extol him for ever; I will sing praise to the God of Jacob.
019	PSA	075	010	“I will bring down all the power of the wicked; But the righteous shall lift up their heads.”
019	PSA	076	001	“For the leader of the music. Upon stringed instruments. A Psalm of Asaph.” In Judah is God known; Great is his name in Israel.
019	PSA	076	002	In Jerusalem is his tabernacle, And in Zion his dwelling-place.
019	PSA	076	003	There brake he the lightning of the bow, The shield, the sword, and all the weapons of battle.
019	PSA	076	004	More glorious and excellent art thou Than those mountains of robbers!
019	PSA	076	005	Spoiled are the stout-hearted; They sank into their sleep; The hands of the mighty were powerless.
019	PSA	076	006	Before thy rebuke, O God of Jacob! Fell chariot and horseman into a deep sleep!
019	PSA	076	007	Thou, thou, O God! art terrible! Who can stand before thee in thine anger?
019	PSA	076	008	Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven; The earth trembled and was still,
019	PSA	076	009	When God arose to judgment, To save all the oppressed of the earth!
019	PSA	076	010	The wrath of man shall praise thee, When thou girdest on the whole of thy wrath!
019	PSA	076	011	Make and perform vows to Jehovah, your God! Let all that dwell around him bring gifts to the terrible One,
019	PSA	076	012	Who casteth down the pride of princes, Who is terrible to the kings of the earth!
019	PSA	077	001	“For the leader of the music of the Jeduthunites. A psalm of Asaph.” I call upon God; I cry aloud for help; I call upon God, that he would hear me!
019	PSA	077	002	In the day of my trouble I seek the Lord; In the night is my hand stretched forth continually; My soul refuseth to be comforted.
019	PSA	077	003	I remember God, and am disquieted; I think of him, and my spirit is overwhelmed.
019	PSA	077	004	Thou keepest mine eyelids from closing; I am distressed, so that I cannot speak!
019	PSA	077	005	I think of the days of old, —The years of ancient times.
019	PSA	077	006	I call to remembrance my songs in the night; I meditate in my heart, And my spirit inquireth:
019	PSA	077	007	Will the Lord be angry for ever? Will he be favorable no more?
019	PSA	077	008	Is his mercy utterly withdrawn for ever? Doth his promise fail from generation to generation?
019	PSA	077	009	Hath God forgotten to be gracious? Hath he in anger shut up his compassion?
019	PSA	077	010	Then I say, “This is mine affliction, A change in the right hand of the Most High.”
019	PSA	077	011	I remember the deeds of Jehovah; I think of thy wonders of old.
019	PSA	077	012	I meditate on all thy works, And talk of thy doings.
019	PSA	077	013	Thy ways, O God! are holy! Who so great a god as our God?
019	PSA	077	014	Thou art a God who doest wonders; Thou hast manifested thy power among the nations.
019	PSA	077	015	With thy strong arm thou didst redeem thy people, —The sons of Jacob and Joseph.
019	PSA	077	016	The waters saw thee, O God! The waters saw thee, and feared, And the deep trembled.
019	PSA	077	017	The clouds poured out water, The skies sent forth thunder, And thine arrows flew.
019	PSA	077	018	Thy thunder roared in the whirlwind; Thy lightning illumined the world; The earth trembled and shook.
019	PSA	077	019	Thy way was through the sea, And thy path through great waters; And thy footsteps could not be found.
019	PSA	077	020	Thou didst lead thy people like a flock, By the hands of Moses and Aaron.
019	PSA	078	001	“A psalm of Asaph.” Give ear, O my people, to my instruction! Incline your ears to the words of my mouth!
019	PSA	078	002	I will open my mouth in a psalm; I will utter sayings of ancient times.
019	PSA	078	003	What we have heard and learned, And our fathers have told us,
019	PSA	078	004	We will not hide from their children; Showing to the generation to come the praises of Jehovah, His might, and the wonders he hath wrought.
019	PSA	078	005	For he appointed statutes in Jacob, And established a law in Israel, Which he commanded our fathers To make known to their children;
019	PSA	078	006	So that the generation to come might know them; The children, which should be born, and rise up, Who should declare them to their children;
019	PSA	078	007	That they might put their trust in God, And not forget his deeds, But keep his commandments;
019	PSA	078	008	And might not be, like their forefathers, A stubborn and rebellious generation, —A generation whose heart was not fixed upon God, And whose spirit was not steadfast toward the Almighty.
019	PSA	078	009	The children of Ephraim were like armed bowmen, Who turn their backs in the day of battle.
019	PSA	078	010	They kept not the covenant of God, And refused to walk in his law;
019	PSA	078	011	And forgot his mighty deeds, And the wonders he had shown them.
019	PSA	078	012	Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, In the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.
019	PSA	078	013	He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; Yea, he made the waters to stand as a heap.
019	PSA	078	014	By day he led them by a cloud, And all the night by a light of fire.
019	PSA	078	015	He clave the rocks in the wilderness, And gave them drink, as from the great deep.
019	PSA	078	016	From the rock he brought flowing streams, And made water to run down like rivers.
019	PSA	078	017	Yet still they sinned against him, And provoked the Most High in the desert.
019	PSA	078	018	They tempted God in their hearts, By asking food for their delight.
019	PSA	078	019	Yea, they spake against God, and said, “Can God spread a table in the wilderness?
019	PSA	078	020	Behold! he smote the rock, and the water flowed, And streams gushed forth: Is he also able to give bread? Can he provide flesh for his people?”
019	PSA	078	021	When, therefore, the LORD heard this, he was wroth: So a fire was kindled against Jacob, And anger arose against Israel.
019	PSA	078	022	Because they believed not in God, And trusted not in his aid.
019	PSA	078	023	Yet he had commanded the clouds above, And had opened the doors of heaven;
019	PSA	078	024	And had rained down upon them manna for food, And had given them the corn of heaven.
019	PSA	078	025	Every one ate the food of princes; He sent them bread to the full.
019	PSA	078	026	Then he caused a strong wind to blow in the heavens, And by his power he brought a south wind;
019	PSA	078	027	He rained down flesh upon them as dust, And feathered fowls as the sand of the sea.
019	PSA	078	028	He caused them to fall in the midst of their camp, Round about their habitations.
019	PSA	078	029	So they did eat, and were filled; For he gave them their own desire.
019	PSA	078	030	Their desire was not yet satisfied, And their meat was yet in their mouths,
019	PSA	078	031	When the wrath of God came upon them, And slew their strong men, And smote down the chosen men of Israel.
019	PSA	078	032	For all this they sinned still, And put no trust in his wondrous works.
019	PSA	078	033	Therefore he consumed their days in vanity, And their years in sudden destruction.
019	PSA	078	034	When he slew them, they sought him; They returned, and sought earnestly for God;
019	PSA	078	035	And remembered that God was their rock, And the Most High their redeemer.
019	PSA	078	036	But they only flattered him with their mouths, And spake falsely to him with their tongues.
019	PSA	078	037	For their hearts were not true to him, Nor were they steadfast in his covenant.
019	PSA	078	038	Yet, being full of compassion, he forgave their iniquity, And would not utterly destroy them; Often he restrained his indignation, And stirred not up all his anger.
019	PSA	078	039	He remembered that they were but flesh, —A breath, that passeth and cometh not back.
019	PSA	078	040	How often did they provoke him in the wilderness! How often did they anger him in the desert!
019	PSA	078	041	Again and again they tempted God, And offended the Holy One of Israel.
019	PSA	078	042	They remembered not his hand, Nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy;
019	PSA	078	043	What signs he had wrought in Egypt, And what wonders in the fields of Zoan.
019	PSA	078	044	He turned their rivers into blood, So that they could not drink of their streams.
019	PSA	078	045	He sent amongst them flies, which devoured them, And frogs, which destroyed them.
019	PSA	078	046	He gave also their fruits to the caterpillar, And their labor to the locust.
019	PSA	078	047	He destroyed their vines with hail, And their sycamore-trees with frost.
019	PSA	078	048	He also gave up their cattle to hail, And their flocks to hot thunderbolts.
019	PSA	078	049	He sent against them the fierceness of his anger, Wrath, indignation, and woe, —A host of angels of evil.
019	PSA	078	050	He made a way for his anger, He spared them not from death, But gave up their lives to the pestilence.
019	PSA	078	051	He smote all the firstborn in Egypt; The first-fruits of their strength in the tents of Ham.
019	PSA	078	052	But he led forth his own people like sheep, And guided them like a flock in the wilderness.
019	PSA	078	053	He led them on safely, so that they feared not, While the sea overwhelmed their enemies.
019	PSA	078	054	He brought them to his own sacred border, Even to this mountain which his right hand had gained.
019	PSA	078	055	He cast out the nations before them, And divided their land by a measuring-line, as an inheritance, And caused the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.
019	PSA	078	056	Yet they tempted and provoked God, the Most High, And kept not his statutes;
019	PSA	078	057	Like their fathers they were faithless, and turned back; They turned aside, like a deceitful bow.
019	PSA	078	058	They provoked his anger by their high places, And stirred up his jealousy by their graven images.
019	PSA	078	059	God saw this, and was wroth, And greatly abhorred Israel;
019	PSA	078	060	So that he forsook the habitation at Shiloh, The tabernacle where he dwelt among men,
019	PSA	078	061	And delivered his strength into captivity, And his glory into the hand of the enemy.
019	PSA	078	062	His own people he gave up to the sword, And was wroth with his own inheritance.
019	PSA	078	063	Fire consumed their young men, And their maidens did not bewail them.
019	PSA	078	064	Their priests fell by the sword, And their widows made no lamentation.
019	PSA	078	065	But at length the Lord awaked as from sleep, As a hero who had been overpowered by wine;
019	PSA	078	066	He smote his enemies, and drove them back, And covered them with everlasting disgrace.
019	PSA	078	067	Yet he rejected the tents of Joseph, And chose not the tribe of Ephraim;
019	PSA	078	068	But chose the tribe of Judah, The Mount Zion which he loved;
019	PSA	078	069	Where he built, like the heavens, his sanctuary; Like the earth, which he hath established for ever.
019	PSA	078	070	And he chose David, his servant, And took him from the sheepfolds;
019	PSA	078	071	From tending the suckling ewes he brought him To feed Jacob his people, And Israel his inheritance.
019	PSA	078	072	He fed them with an upright heart, And guided them with skilful hands.
019	PSA	079	001	“A psalm of Asaph.” O God! the nations have come into thine inheritance; They have polluted thy holy temple; They have made Jerusalem a heap of ruins!
019	PSA	079	002	They have given the dead bodies of thy servants to be food for the birds of heaven, The flesh of thy holy ones to the wild beasts of the earth!
019	PSA	079	003	Their blood have they shed like water around Jerusalem, And there was none to bury them!
019	PSA	079	004	We have become the reproach of our neighbors, —The scorn and derision of those around us.
019	PSA	079	005	How long, O LORD! wilt thou be angry for ever? How long shall thy jealousy burn like fire?
019	PSA	079	006	Pour out thy wrath on the nations which acknowledge thee not. And on the kingdoms which call not upon thy name!
019	PSA	079	007	For they have devoured Jacob, And laid waste his dwelling-place.
019	PSA	079	008	O remember not against us former iniquities; Let thy tender mercy speedily succor us,
019	PSA	079	009	For we are brought very low! Help us, O God of our salvation! for the honor of thy name; F or thy name's sake save us, and forgive our iniquities!
019	PSA	079	010	Why should the nations say, “Where is their God?” May the revenging of the blood of thy servants, which hath been shed, Be manifested among the nations before our eyes!
019	PSA	079	011	Let the cry of the prisoner come before thee! According to the greatness of thy power preserve those that are appointed to die!
019	PSA	079	012	And return sevenfold into our neighbors' bosoms The reproach with which they have reproached thee, O Lord!
019	PSA	079	013	So shall we, thy people, and the flock of thy pasture, Give thanks to thee for ever. And show forth thy praise to all generations.
019	PSA	080	001	“For the leader of the music. Upon the Shushan-Eduth. A psalm of Asaph.” Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel! Thou who leadest Joseph like a flock, Thou who sittest between the cherubs, shine forth!
019	PSA	080	002	Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, stir up thy strength, And come and save us!
019	PSA	080	003	Bring us back, O God! And cause thy face to shine, that we may be saved!
019	PSA	080	004	O LORD, God of hosts! How long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people?
019	PSA	080	005	For thou causest them to eat the bread of tears, And givest them tears to drink, in full measure.
019	PSA	080	006	Thou hast made us the object of strife to our neighbors, And our enemies hold us in derision.
019	PSA	080	007	Bring us back, O God of hosts! And cause thy face to shine that we may be saved!
019	PSA	080	008	Thou didst bring a vine out of Egypt; Thou didst expel the nations, and plant it.
019	PSA	080	009	Thou didst prepare a place for it; It spread its roots, and filled the land.
019	PSA	080	010	The mountains were covered with its shade, And its branches were like the cedars of God.
019	PSA	080	011	It sent out its boughs to the sea, And its branches to the river.
019	PSA	080	012	Why hast thou now broken down its hedges, So that all who pass by do pluck from it?
019	PSA	080	013	The boar from the wood doth waste it, And the wild beast of the forest doth devour it.
019	PSA	080	014	O God of hosts! return, we beseech thee, Look down from heaven, and behold, And have regard to this vine!
019	PSA	080	015	Protect what thy right hand planted; The branch which thou madest strong for thyself!
019	PSA	080	016	It is burnt with fire; it is cut down; Under thy rebuke they perish.
019	PSA	080	017	May thy hand be over the man of thy right hand, The man whom thou madest strong for thyself!
019	PSA	080	018	So will we no more turn back from thee: Revive us, and upon thy name alone will we call!
019	PSA	080	019	Bring us back, O LORD, God of hosts! And cause thy face to shine, that we may he saved!
019	PSA	081	001	“For the leader of the music. On the Gittith. A psalm of Asaph.” Sing joyfully to God, our strength! Shout with gladness to the God of Jacob!
019	PSA	081	002	Raise a song, and strike the timbrel, The sweet-sounding harp, and the psaltery!
019	PSA	081	003	Blow the trumpet at the new moon; At the full moon, also, on our festal day!
019	PSA	081	004	For this is a statute for Israel, A law of the God of Jacob;
019	PSA	081	005	He appointed it as a memorial in Joseph, When he went out of the land of Egypt, Where he heard a language which he knew not.
019	PSA	081	006	“I relieved [[said he]] thy shoulders from their burden; Thy hands were removed from the hod.
019	PSA	081	007	Thou didst call in trouble, and I delivered thee; In the secret place of thunder I answered thee; I proved thee at the waters of Meribah. (Pause)
019	PSA	081	008	Hear, O my people! and I will admonish thee! O Israel! that thou wouldst hearken to me!
019	PSA	081	009	Let there be no strange god within thee, Nor worship thou any foreign god!
019	PSA	081	010	I Jehovah am thy God, Who brought thee out of the land of Egypt: Open wide thy mouth, and I will fill it!
019	PSA	081	011	But my people would not listen to my voice, And Israel would not hearken to me.
019	PSA	081	012	So I gave them up to the obstinacy of their hearts, And they walked according to their own devices.
019	PSA	081	013	“O that my people had hearkened to me! That Israel had walked in my ways!
019	PSA	081	014	Soon would I have brought low their enemies, And turned my hand against their adversaries.
019	PSA	081	015	The haters of Jehovah should have become suppliants to them, And their prosperity should have endured for ever.
019	PSA	081	016	With the finest of the wheat I would have fed them, And with honey out of the rock would I have satisfied them.”
019	PSA	082	001	“A psalm of Asaph.” God standeth in God's assembly, He judgeth in the midst of the gods.
019	PSA	082	002	“How long will ye judge unjustly, And favor the cause of the wicked? (Pause)
019	PSA	082	003	Defend the poor and the fatherless; Do justice to the wretched and the needy!
019	PSA	082	004	Deliver the poor and the destitute; Save them from the hand of the wicked!
019	PSA	082	005	They are without knowledge and without understanding; They walk in darkness: Therefore all the foundations of the land are shaken.
019	PSA	082	006	I have said, Ye are gods, And all of you children of the Most High;
019	PSA	082	007	But ye shall die like men, And fall like the rest of the princes.”
019	PSA	082	008	Arise, O God! judge the earth! For all the nations are thy possession.
019	PSA	083	001	“A psalm of Asaph.” O God! keep not silence! Hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God!
019	PSA	083	002	For, lo! thine enemies roar, And they who hate thee lift up their heads.
019	PSA	083	003	For they form secret plots against thy people, And consult together against thy chosen ones.
019	PSA	083	004	“Come,” say they, “let us blot them out from the number of the nations, That the name of Israel may no more be remembered!”
019	PSA	083	005	With one consent they consult together, Against thee do they form a league, —
019	PSA	083	006	The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites, Of Moab and the Hagarenes,
019	PSA	083	007	Gebal and Ammon and Amalek, The Philistines, with the inhabitants of Tyre.
019	PSA	083	008	The Assyrians also are joined with them; They lend their strength to the children of Lot.
019	PSA	083	009	Do to them as to the Midianites, As to Sisera, as to Jabin at the brook Kison,
019	PSA	083	010	Who perished at Endor, And were trampled like dung to the earth.
019	PSA	083	011	Make their chiefs like Oreb and Zeeb; Yea, all their princes as Zeba and Zalmunna!
019	PSA	083	012	Who say, “Let us seize on God's habitations!”
019	PSA	083	013	Make them, O my God! like whirling chaff; Like stubble before the wind!
019	PSA	083	014	As fire consumeth the forest, And as flame setteth the mountains in a blaze,
019	PSA	083	015	So pursue them with thy tempest, And terrify them with thy storm!
019	PSA	083	016	Cover their faces with shame, That they may seek thy name, O LORD!
019	PSA	083	017	Let them be confounded! Yea, let them be put to shame, and perish!
019	PSA	083	018	That they may know that thy name alone is Jehovah; That thou art the Most High over all the earth.
019	PSA	084	001	“For the leader of the music. On the Gittith. A psalm of the sons of Korah.” How lovely are thy tabernacles, O LORD of hosts!
019	PSA	084	002	My soul longeth, yea, fainteth, for the courts of the LORD; My heart and my flesh cry aloud for the living God.
019	PSA	084	003	The very sparrow findeth an abode, And the swallow a nest, where they may lay their young, By thine altars, O LORD of hosts, My king and my God!
019	PSA	084	004	Happy they who dwell in thy house, Who are continually praising thee! (Pause)
019	PSA	084	005	Happy the man whose glory is in thee, In whose heart are the ways [[to Jerusalem]]!
019	PSA	084	006	Passing through the valley of Baca, they make it a fountain; and the early rain covereth it with blessings.
019	PSA	084	007	They go on from strength to strength; Every one of them appeareth before God in Zion.
019	PSA	084	008	Hear my prayer, O LORD, God of hosts! Give ear, O God of Jacob! (Pause)
019	PSA	084	009	Look down, O God! our shield, And behold the face of thine anointed!
019	PSA	084	010	For a day spent in thy courts is better than a thousand: I would rather stand on the threshold of the house of my God, Than dwell in the tents of wickedness.
019	PSA	084	011	For the LORD God is a sun and a shield; The LORD giveth grace and glory; No good thing doth he withhold From them that walk uprightly.
019	PSA	084	012	O LORD of hosts! Happy the man who trusteth in thee!
019	PSA	085	001	“For the leader of the music. A psalm of the sons of Korah.” O LORD! thou hast been favorable to thy land; Thou hast brought back the captives of Jacob;
019	PSA	085	002	Thou didst forgive the iniquity of thy people, And cover all their sins! (Pause)
019	PSA	085	003	Thou didst take away all thy displeasure, And abate the fierceness of thy wrath.
019	PSA	085	004	Restore us, O God of our salvation! And let thine anger towards us cease!
019	PSA	085	005	Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? Wilt thou continue thy wrath from generation to generation?
019	PSA	085	006	Wilt thou not revive us again, That thy people may rejoice in thee?
019	PSA	085	007	Show us thy compassion, O LORD! And grant us thy salvation!
019	PSA	085	008	I will hear what God the LORD will speak: Truly he will speak peace to his people, and to his servants; Only let them not turn again to folly!
019	PSA	085	009	Yea, his salvation is near to those who fear him, That glory may dwell in our land.
019	PSA	085	010	Mercy and truth shall meet together, Righteousness and peace shall kiss each other;
019	PSA	085	011	Truth shall spring out of the earth; Righteousness shall look down from heaven.
019	PSA	085	012	Yea, Jehovah will give prosperity, And our land shall yield her increase.
019	PSA	085	013	Righteousness shall go before him, And set us in the way of his steps.
019	PSA	086	001	“A prayer of David.” Incline thine ear, O LORD! and hear me, For I am poor and distressed!
019	PSA	086	002	Preserve my life, for I am devoted to thee! Save, O thou my God! thy servant who trusteth in thee!
019	PSA	086	003	Have pity upon me, O Lord! For to thee do I cry daily!
019	PSA	086	004	Revive the soul of thy servant, For to thee, O Lord! do I lift up my soul!
019	PSA	086	005	For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive; Yea, rich in mercy to all that call upon thee!
019	PSA	086	006	Give ear, O LORD! to my prayer, And attend to the voice of my supplication!
019	PSA	086	007	In the day of my trouble I call upon thee, For thou dost answer me!
019	PSA	086	008	Among the gods there is none like thee, O Lord! And there are no works like thy works!
019	PSA	086	009	All the nations which thou hast made must come and worship before thee, O Lord! And glorify thy name!
019	PSA	086	010	For great art thou, and wondrous are thy works; Thou alone art God!
019	PSA	086	011	Teach me, O LORD! thy way, That I may walk in thy truth; Unite all my heart to fear thy name!
019	PSA	086	012	I will praise thee, O Lord, my God! with my whole heart; I will give glory to thy name for ever!
019	PSA	086	013	For thy kindness to me hath been great; Thou hast delivered me from the depths of the underworld!
019	PSA	086	014	O God! the proud have risen against me; Bands of cruel men seek my life, And set not thee before their eyes.
019	PSA	086	015	But thou, O Lord! art a God full of compassion and kindness, Long-suffering, rich in mercy and truth!
019	PSA	086	016	Look upon me, and have compassion upon me! Give thy strength to thy servant, And save the son of thy handmaid!
019	PSA	086	017	Show me a token for good, That my enemies may see it and be confounded; Because thou, O LORD! helpest and comfortest me!
019	PSA	087	001	“A psalm of the sons of Korah.” His foundation is in the holy mountains;
019	PSA	087	002	Jehovah loveth the gates of Zion More than all the dwellings of Jacob.
019	PSA	087	003	Glorious things are said of thee, O city of God! (Pause)
019	PSA	087	004	“I name Egypt and Babylon among them that know me; Behold! Philistia, Tyre, and Ethiopia, —They also were born there.”
019	PSA	087	005	And of Zion it shall be said, “Men of every nation were born there, And the Most High hath established her.”
019	PSA	087	006	Jehovah, when he numbereth the nations, shall write, “These were born there!” (Pause)
019	PSA	087	007	Singers as well as dancers, —All my springs are in thee!
019	PSA	088	001	“A psalm of the sons of Korah. For the leader of the music. Upon wind instruments. A psalm of Heman, the Ezrahite.” O LORD, God of my salvation! To thee do I cry by day, And by night is my prayer before thee!
019	PSA	088	002	Let my supplication come before thee; Incline thine ear to my cry!
019	PSA	088	003	For my soul is full of misery, And my life draweth near to the underworld.
019	PSA	088	004	I am counted with those who are going down to the pit; I am like one who hath no strength.
019	PSA	088	005	I am left to myself among the dead, Like the slain who lie in the grave, Whom thou no more rememberest, And who are cut off from thy [[protecting]] hand.
019	PSA	088	006	Thou hast placed me in a deep pit, In a dark and deep abyss.
019	PSA	088	007	Thy wrath presseth hard upon me, And thou afflictest me with all thy waves! (Pause)
019	PSA	088	008	Thou hast put mine acquaintances far from me, Yea, thou hast made me their abhorrence: I am shut up, and cannot go forth.
019	PSA	088	009	Mine eyes languish by reason of my affliction. I call upon thee daily, O LORD! To thee do I stretch out my hands!
019	PSA	088	010	Canst thou show wonders to the dead? Shall the dead arise, and praise thee? (Pause)
019	PSA	088	011	Shall thy goodness be declared in the grave, Or thy faithfulness in the place of corruption?
019	PSA	088	012	Shall thy wonders be known in the dark, And thy justice in the land of forgetfulness?
019	PSA	088	013	To thee do I cry, O LORD! In the morning doth my cry come before thee.
019	PSA	088	014	Why, O LORD! dost thou cast me off? Why hidest thou thy face from me?
019	PSA	088	015	I have been afflicted and languishing from my youth; I suffer thy terrors, and am distracted.
019	PSA	088	016	Thy fierce wrath overwhelmeth me; Thy terrors utterly destroy me.
019	PSA	088	017	They surround me daily like water; They compass me about together.
019	PSA	088	018	Lover and friend hast thou put far from me; My acquaintances are withdrawn from my sight.
019	PSA	089	001	“A psalm of Ethan, the Ezrahite.” I will sing of the mercies of the LORD for ever; With my mouth will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations!
019	PSA	089	002	For I know that thy mercy endureth for ever; Thou hast established thy truth like the heavens.
019	PSA	089	003	“I have made a covenant with my chosen; I have sworn to David, my servant:
019	PSA	089	004	Thy family I will establish for ever, And build up thy throne to all generations.” (Pause)
019	PSA	089	005	The heavens shall praise thy wonders, O LORD! And the assembly of the holy ones thy truth!
019	PSA	089	006	Who in the heavens can be compared to Jehovah? Who is like Jehovah among the sons of God?
019	PSA	089	007	A God greatly to be feared in the assembly of the holy ones, And to be had in reverence above all who are around him?
019	PSA	089	008	O Jehovah, God of hosts! Who is mighty like thee, O Jehovah? And thy faithfulness is round about thee.
019	PSA	089	009	Thou rulest the raging of the sea; When the waves thereof rise, thou stillest them!
019	PSA	089	010	Thou didst break Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain; Thou didst scatter thine enemies with thy mighty arm.
019	PSA	089	011	The heavens are thine; thine also is the earth; The world and all that is therein, thou didst found them.
019	PSA	089	012	The North and the South were created by thee; Tabor and Hermon rejoice in thy name.
019	PSA	089	013	Thine is a mighty arm; Strong is thy hand, and high thy right hand.
019	PSA	089	014	Justice and equity are the foundation of thy throne; Mercy and truth go before thy face.
019	PSA	089	015	Happy the people that know the trumpet's sound! They walk, O LORD! in the light of thy countenance;
019	PSA	089	016	In thy name they daily rejoice, And in thy righteousness they glory!
019	PSA	089	017	For thou art the glory of their strength; Yea, through thy favor our horn exalteth itself!
019	PSA	089	018	For from Jehovah is our shield, And from the Holy One of Israel is our king.
019	PSA	089	019	Once thou spakest in a vision to thy holy one, And saidst, —”I have laid help on one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen from the people;
019	PSA	089	020	I have found David, my servant; With my holy oil have I anointed him.
019	PSA	089	021	With him shall my hand be established, And my arm shall strengthen him.
019	PSA	089	022	The enemy shall not have power over him, Nor shall the unrighteous man oppress him.
019	PSA	089	023	For I will beat down his foes before him, And overthrow them that hate him.
019	PSA	089	024	My faithfulness and mercy shall be with him, And through my name shall his horn be exalted.
019	PSA	089	025	I will extend his hand to the sea, And his right hand to the rivers.
019	PSA	089	026	He shall say to me, 'Thou art my father, My God, and the rock of my salvation!'
019	PSA	089	027	I will also make him my first-born, Highest of the kings of the earth.
019	PSA	089	028	My mercy I will continue to him for ever; My covenant with him shall be steadfast.
019	PSA	089	029	I will make his family to endure for ever; And his throne shall be as lasting as the heavens.
019	PSA	089	030	Should his children forsake my law, And walk not in my statutes,
019	PSA	089	031	Should they break my commandments, And observe not my precepts,
019	PSA	089	032	I will punish their transgressions with a rod, And their iniquity with stripes.
019	PSA	089	033	But my kindness will I not withdraw from him, Nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.
019	PSA	089	034	I will not break my covenant, Nor alter what hath gone from my lips.
019	PSA	089	035	Once have I sworn in my holiness, That I will not be false unto David.
019	PSA	089	036	His family shall endure for ever, And his throne as the sun before me.
019	PSA	089	037	It shall be established for ever like the moon; Like the faithful witness in the sky.”
019	PSA	089	038	But now thou forsakest and abhorrest, And art angry with, thine anointed.
019	PSA	089	039	Thou hast made void the covenant with thy servant; Thou hast cast his crown to the ground.
019	PSA	089	040	Thou hast broken down all his hedges; Thou hast brought his strongholds to ruin.
019	PSA	089	041	All who pass by plunder him; He is a reproach to his neighbors.
019	PSA	089	042	Thou hast lifted up the right hand of his enemies; Thou hast made all his adversaries to rejoice.
019	PSA	089	043	Yea, thou hast turned the edge of his sword, And made him unable to stand in battle.
019	PSA	089	044	Thou hast brought his glory to an end, And hast cast down his throne to the ground.
019	PSA	089	045	Thou hast shortened the days of his youth; Thou hast covered him with shame.
019	PSA	089	046	How long, O LORD! wilt thou hide thyself for ever? How long shall thine anger burn like fire?
019	PSA	089	047	Remember how short is my life, To what frailty thou hast created all men!
019	PSA	089	048	What man liveth, and seeth not death? Who can deliver himself from the underworld?
019	PSA	089	049	Where, Lord, is thy former loving-kindness Which thou didst swear to David in thy truth?
019	PSA	089	050	Remember, O Lord! the reproach of thy servants, How I bear in my bosom the taunts of all the many nations,
019	PSA	089	051	With which thine enemies have reproached me, O LORD! With which they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed!
019	PSA	089	052	[Praised be Jehovah for ever! Amen, yea, amen!]
019	PSA	090	001	“BOOK IV. A prayer of Moses, the man of God.” LORD! thou hast been our dwelling-place In all generations!
019	PSA	090	002	Before the mountains were brought forth, Or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, Even from everlasting to everlasting thou art God!
019	PSA	090	003	But man thou turnest again to dust, And sayst, “Return, ye children of men!”
019	PSA	090	004	For a thousand years are, in thy sight, As yesterday when it is past, And as a watch in the night.
019	PSA	090	005	Thou carriest him away as with a flood; He is a dream; In the morning he springeth up like grass,
019	PSA	090	006	Which flourisheth and shooteth up in the morning, And in the evening is cut down, and withered.
019	PSA	090	007	For we are consumed by thine anger, And by thy wrath are we destroyed.
019	PSA	090	008	Thou settest our iniquities before thee, Our secret sins in the light of thy countenance.
019	PSA	090	009	By reason of thine anger all our days vanish away; We spend our years like a thought.
019	PSA	090	010	The days of our life are threescore years and ten, And, by reason of strength, may be fourscore years: Yet is the pride of them weariness and sorrow; For it vanisheth swiftly, and we fly away.
019	PSA	090	011	Yet who attendeth to the power of thine anger? Who with due reverence regardeth thine indignation?
019	PSA	090	012	Teach us so to number our days, That we may apply our hearts to wisdom!
019	PSA	090	013	Desist, O LORD! How long—? Have compassion upon thy servants!
019	PSA	090	014	Satisfy us speedily with thy mercy, That we may rejoice and be glad all our days!
019	PSA	090	015	Make us glad according to the time in which thou hast afflicted us; According to the years in which we have seen adversity!
019	PSA	090	016	Let thy deeds be known to thy servants, And thy glory to their children!
019	PSA	090	017	Let the favor of the LORD our God be upon us, And establish for us the work of our hands; Yea, the work of our hands, establish thou it!
019	PSA	091	001	He who sitteth under the shelter of the Most High Maketh his abode in the shadow of the Almighty.
019	PSA	091	002	I say to the LORD, Thou art my refuge and my fortress; My God, in whom I trust.
019	PSA	091	003	Surely he will deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, And from the wasting pestilence;
019	PSA	091	004	He will cover thee with his feathers, And under his wings shalt thou find refuge; His faithfulness shall be thy shield and buckler.
019	PSA	091	005	Thou shalt not be afraid of the terror of the night, Nor of the arrow that flieth by day;
019	PSA	091	006	Nor of the pestilence that walketh in darkness, Nor of the plague that destroyeth at noonday.
019	PSA	091	007	A thousand shall fall by thy side, And ten thousand at thy right hand; But thee it shall not touch.
019	PSA	091	008	Thou shalt only behold with thine eyes, And see the recompense of the wicked.
019	PSA	091	009	Because thou hast made the LORD thy refuge, And the Most High thy habitation,
019	PSA	091	010	No evil shall befall thee, Nor any plague come near thy dwelling.
019	PSA	091	011	For he will give his angels charge over thee, To guard thee in all thy ways.
019	PSA	091	012	They shall bear thee up in their hands, Lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.
019	PSA	091	013	Thou shalt tread upon the lion and the adder; The young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under foot.
019	PSA	091	014	“Because he loveth me, I will deliver him; I will set him on high, because he knoweth my name.
019	PSA	091	015	When he calleth upon me, I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and bring him to honor.
019	PSA	091	016	With long life will I satisfy him, And show him my salvation.”
019	PSA	092	001	“A psalm for the Sabbath-day.” It is a good thing to give thanks to the LORD, And to sing praises to thy name, O Most High!
019	PSA	092	002	To show forth thy loving-kindness in the morning, And thy faithfulness every night,
019	PSA	092	003	Upon the ten-stringed instrument and the lute, Upon the harp with a solemn sound.
019	PSA	092	004	For thou, LORD, hast made me glad by thy doings; In the works of thy hands I greatly rejoice!
019	PSA	092	005	How great are thy works, O LORD! How deep thy purposes!
019	PSA	092	006	But the unwise man knoweth not this, And the fool understandeth it not.
019	PSA	092	007	When the wicked spring up like grass, And all who practise iniquity flourish, It is but to be destroyed for ever!
019	PSA	092	008	Thou, O LORD! art for ever exalted!
019	PSA	092	009	For, lo! thine enemies, O LORD! For, lo! thine enemies perish, And dispersed are all who do iniquity!
019	PSA	092	010	But my horn thou exaltest like the buffalo's; I am anointed with fresh oil.
019	PSA	092	011	Mine eye hath gazed with joy upon mine enemies; Mine ears have heard with joy of my wicked adversaries.
019	PSA	092	012	The righteous shall flourish like the palm-tree; They shall grow up like the cedars of Lebanon;
019	PSA	092	013	Planted in the house of the LORD, They shall flourish in the courts of our God.
019	PSA	092	014	Even in old age they bring forth fruit; They are green, and full of sap;
019	PSA	092	015	To show that the LORD, my rock, is upright, That there is no unrighteousness in him.
019	PSA	093	001	Jehovah reigneth; he is clothed with majesty; Jehovah is clothed with majesty, and girded with strength; Therefore the earth standeth firm, and cannot be moved.
019	PSA	093	002	Thy throne was established of old; Thou art from everlasting!
019	PSA	093	003	The floods, O LORD! lift up, The floods lift up their voice; The floods lift up their roaring!
019	PSA	093	004	Mightier than the voice of many waters, Yea, than the mighty waves of the sea, Is the LORD in his lofty habitation.
019	PSA	093	005	Thy promises are most sure; Holiness becometh thy house, O LORD! for ever!
019	PSA	094	001	O LORD! thou God of vengeance! O thou God of vengeance! shine forth!
019	PSA	094	002	Rouse thyself, thou judge of the earth! Render a recompense to the proud!
019	PSA	094	003	How long, O LORD! shall the wicked, How long shall the wicked triumph?
019	PSA	094	004	How long shall their lips pour forth insolence? How long shall all the evil-doers boast?
019	PSA	094	005	O LORD! they trample upon thy people, And oppress thine inheritance!
019	PSA	094	006	They slay the widow, and the stranger, And murder the fatherless;
019	PSA	094	007	And they say, “The LORD doth not see, The God of Jacob doth not regard!”
019	PSA	094	008	Be instructed, ye most stupid of mankind! O when, ye fools, will ye be wise?
019	PSA	094	009	He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? He that formed the eye, shall he not see?
019	PSA	094	010	He that chastiseth nations, shall not he punish? He that teacheth man knowledge, shall not he know?
019	PSA	094	011	The LORD knoweth the thoughts of men, That they are vanity.
019	PSA	094	012	Happy the man, O LORD! whom thou correctest, Whom by thy teaching thou makest wise;
019	PSA	094	013	To give him peace in the days of adversity, Until a pit be digged for the wicked!
019	PSA	094	014	For the LORD will not forsake his people, Nor abandon his own inheritance.
019	PSA	094	015	For judgment shall return to justice, And all the upright in heart shall follow it.
019	PSA	094	016	Who will rise up for me against the wicked? Who will stand up for me against the evil-doers?
019	PSA	094	017	If the LORD had not been my help, I had well nigh dwelt in the land of silence.
019	PSA	094	018	When I think that my foot is slipping, Thy goodness, O LORD! holdeth me up.
019	PSA	094	019	In the multitude of anxieties within me, Thy consolations revive my soul.
019	PSA	094	020	Shall with thee be allied the throne of iniquity, Which deviseth mischief against law?
019	PSA	094	021	They band together against the life of the righteous, And condemn innocent blood.
019	PSA	094	022	But the LORD is my fortress, And my God the rock of my refuge.
019	PSA	094	023	He will bring upon them their own iniquity; Yea, through their own wickedness he will cut them off; Yea, the LORD, our God, will cut them off.
019	PSA	095	001	O come, let us sing to the LORD; Let us raise a voice of joy to the rock of our salvation!
019	PSA	095	002	Let us come into his presence with thanksgiving, And sing joyfully to him with psalms!
019	PSA	095	003	For Jehovah is a great God; Yea, a great king over all gods.
019	PSA	095	004	In his hands are the depths of the earth; His also are the heights of the mountains.
019	PSA	095	005	The sea is his, and he made it; The dry land also his hands formed.
019	PSA	095	006	O come, let us worship and bow down! Let us kneel before the LORD, our maker!
019	PSA	095	007	For he is our God, And we are the people of his pasture and the flock of his hand. O that ye would now hear his voice!
019	PSA	095	008	“Harden not your hearts as at Meribah [[the strife]], As in the day of temptation [[Massah]] in the wilderness,
019	PSA	095	009	Where your fathers tempted me And tried me, although they had seen my works.
019	PSA	095	010	Forty years was I offended with that generation: And I said, 'They are a people of a perverse heart, And who have no regard to my ways.'
019	PSA	095	011	Therefore I sware, in my wrath, That they should not enter into my rest.”
019	PSA	096	001	O sing to Jehovah a new song; Sing to Jehovah, all the earth!
019	PSA	096	002	Sing to Jehovah; praise his name, Show forth his salvation from day to day!
019	PSA	096	003	Proclaim his glory among the nations, His wonders among all people!
019	PSA	096	004	For Jehovah is great, and greatly to be praised; He is to be feared above all gods.
019	PSA	096	005	For all the gods of the nations are idols; But Jehovah made the heavens.
019	PSA	096	006	Honor and majesty are before him; Glory and beauty are in his holy abode.
019	PSA	096	007	Give to Jehovah, ye tribes of the people, Give to Jehovah glory and praise!
019	PSA	096	008	Give to Jehovah the glory due to his name; Bring an offering, and come into his courts!
019	PSA	096	009	O worship Jehovah in holy attire! Tremble before him, all the earth!
019	PSA	096	010	Say among the nations, Jehovah is king; The world shall stand firm; it shall not be moved; He will judge the nations in righteousness.
019	PSA	096	011	Let the heavens be glad, and the earth rejoice; Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof;
019	PSA	096	012	Let the fields be joyful, with all that is therein; Let all the trees of the forest rejoice
019	PSA	096	013	Before Jehovah! for he cometh, He cometh to judge the earth! He will judge the world with justice, And the nations with faithfulness.
019	PSA	097	001	The LORD reigneth, let the earth rejoice! Let the multitude of isles be glad!
019	PSA	097	002	Clouds and darkness are round about him; Justice and equity are the foundation of his throne.
019	PSA	097	003	Before him goeth a fire, Which burneth up his enemies around.
019	PSA	097	004	His lightnings illumine the world; The earth beholdeth and trembleth.
019	PSA	097	005	The mountains melt like wax at the presence of the LORD, At the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.
019	PSA	097	006	The heavens declare his righteousness, And all nations behold his glory.
019	PSA	097	007	Confounded be they who worship graven images, Who glory in idols! To him, all ye gods, bow down!
019	PSA	097	008	Zion hath heard, and is glad, And the daughters of Judah exult On account of thy judgments, O LORD!
019	PSA	097	009	For thou, O LORD! art most high above all the earth; Thou art far exalted above all gods!
019	PSA	097	010	Ye that love the LORD, hate evil! He preserveth the lives of his servants, And delivereth them from the hand of the wicked.
019	PSA	097	011	Light is sown for the righteous, And joy for the upright in heart.
019	PSA	097	012	Rejoice, O ye righteous, in the LORD, And praise his holy name!
019	PSA	098	001	“A psalm.” Sing to the LORD a new song; For he hath done marvellous things; His own right hand and his holy arm have gotten him the victory!
019	PSA	098	002	The LORD hath made known his salvation; His righteousness hath he manifested in the sight of the nations.
019	PSA	098	003	He hath remembered his mercy and truth toward the house of Israel, And all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.
019	PSA	098	004	Shout unto the LORD, all the earth! Break forth into joy, and exult, and sing!
019	PSA	098	005	Sing to the LORD with the harp, With the harp, and the voice of song!
019	PSA	098	006	With clarions, and the sound of trumpets, Make a joyful noise before the LORD the King!
019	PSA	098	007	Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; The world, and they that dwell therein;
019	PSA	098	008	Let the rivers clap their hands, And the mountains rejoice together
019	PSA	098	009	Before the LORD! for he cometh to judge the earth! With righteousness will he judge the world, And the nations with equity.
019	PSA	099	001	The LORD reigneth, let the nations tremble! He sitteth between the cherubs, let the earth quake!
019	PSA	099	002	Great is the LORD upon Zion; He is exalted over all the nations.
019	PSA	099	003	Let men praise thy great and terrible name! It is holy.
019	PSA	099	004	Let them declare the glory of the King who loveth justice! Thou hast established equity; Thou dost execute justice in Jacob!
019	PSA	099	005	Exalt ye Jehovah, our God, And bow yourselves down at his footstool! He is holy.
019	PSA	099	006	Moses and Aaron, with his priests, And Samuel, who called upon his name, —They called upon the LORD, and he answered them.
019	PSA	099	007	He spake to them in the cloudy pillar; They kept his commandments, And the ordinances which he gave them.
019	PSA	099	008	Thou, O LORD, our God! didst answer them; Thou wast to them a forgiving God, Though thou didst punish their transgressions!
019	PSA	099	009	Exalt the LORD, our God. And worship at his holy mountain! For the LORD, our God, is holy.
019	PSA	100	001	“A psalm of praise.” Raise a voice of joy unto the LORD, all ye lands!
019	PSA	100	002	Serve the LORD with gladness; Come before his presence with rejoicing!
019	PSA	100	003	Know ye that Jehovah is God! It is he that made us, and we are his, His people, and the flock of his pasture.
019	PSA	100	004	Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, And his courts with praise; Be thankful to him, and bless his name!
019	PSA	100	005	For the LORD is good; his mercy is everlasting; And his truth endureth to all generations.
019	PSA	101	001	“A psalm of David.” I will sing of mercy and justice; To thee, O LORD! will I sing!
019	PSA	101	002	I will have regard to the way of uprightness: When thou shalt come to me, I will walk within my house with an upright heart.
019	PSA	101	003	I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes; I hate the work of evil-doers; It shall not cleave to me.
019	PSA	101	004	The perverse in heart shall be far from me; I will not know a wicked person.
019	PSA	101	005	Whoso slandereth his neighbor in secret, him will I cut off; Him that hath a haughty look and a proud heart I will not endure.
019	PSA	101	006	Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me; He that walketh in the way of uprightness shall serve me.
019	PSA	101	007	He who practiseth deceit shall not dwell in my house; He who telleth lies shall not remain in my sight.
019	PSA	101	008	Every morning will I destroy the wicked of the land, That I may cut off all evil-doers from the city of the LORD.
019	PSA	102	001	“A prayer of the afflicted, when in deep distress he poureth out his complaint before the Lord.” Hear my prayer, O LORD! And let my cry come unto thee!
019	PSA	102	002	Hide not thy face from me in the day of my trouble; Incline thine ear to me when I call! Answer me speedily!
019	PSA	102	003	For my life is consumed like smoke, And my bones burn like a brand.
019	PSA	102	004	My heart is smitten and withered like grass; Yea, I forget to eat my bread.
019	PSA	102	005	By reason of my sighing, my bones cleave to my skin;
019	PSA	102	006	I am like the pelican of the wilderness; I am like an owl amid ruins.
019	PSA	102	007	I am sleepless; I am like a solitary bird upon the house-top.
019	PSA	102	008	All the day long my enemies reproach me; They who rage against me curse by me.
019	PSA	102	009	For I eat ashes like bread, And mingle my drink with tears.
019	PSA	102	010	On account of thine indignation and thy wrath; For thou hast lifted me up and cast me down!
019	PSA	102	011	My life is like a declining shadow, And I wither like grass.
019	PSA	102	012	But thou, O LORD! endurest for ever, And thy name from generation to generation!
019	PSA	102	013	Thou wilt arise and have pity upon Zion, For the time to favor her, yea, the set time, is come.
019	PSA	102	014	For thy servants take pleasure in her stones; Yea, they have a regard for her dust.
019	PSA	102	015	Then shall the nations fear the name of Jehovah, And all the kings of the earth thy glory.
019	PSA	102	016	For Jehovah will build up Zion; He will appear in his glory.
019	PSA	102	017	He will regard the prayer of the destitute, And not despise their supplication.
019	PSA	102	018	This shall be written for the generation to come, That the people to be born may praise Jehovah.
019	PSA	102	019	For he looketh down from his holy height, From heaven doth he cast his eye upon the earth,
019	PSA	102	020	To listen to the sighs of the prisoner. To release those that are doomed to death;
019	PSA	102	021	That they may declare the name of Jehovah in Zion, And his praise in Jerusalem,
019	PSA	102	022	When the nations are assembled together, And the kingdoms to serve Jehovah.
019	PSA	102	023	He hath weakened my strength on the way, He hath shortened my days.
019	PSA	102	024	I say, O my God! take me not away in the midst of my days! Thy years endure through all generations.
019	PSA	102	025	Of old hast thou laid the foundations of the earth, And the heavens are the work of thy hands;
019	PSA	102	026	They shall perish, but thou shalt endure; Yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; As a vesture shalt thou change them, And they shall be changed;
019	PSA	102	027	But thou art the same, And thy years have no end.
019	PSA	102	028	The children of thy servants shall dwell securely, And their posterity shall be established before thee.
019	PSA	103	001	“A psalm of David.” Bless the LORD, O my soul! And all that is within me, bless his holy name!
019	PSA	103	002	Bless the LORD, O my soul! And forget not all his benefits!
019	PSA	103	003	Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; Who healeth all thy diseases;
019	PSA	103	004	Who redeemeth thy life from the grave; Who crowneth thee with loving-kindness and tender mercies;
019	PSA	103	005	Who satisfieth thine old age with good, So that thy youth is renewed like the eagle's.
019	PSA	103	006	The LORD executeth justice And equity for all the oppressed.
019	PSA	103	007	He made known his ways to Moses, His doings to the children of Israel.
019	PSA	103	008	The LORD is merciful and kind, Slow to anger and rich in mercy.
019	PSA	103	009	He doth not always chide, Nor doth he keep his anger for ever.
019	PSA	103	010	He hath not dealt with us according to our sins, Nor requited us according to our iniquities.
019	PSA	103	011	As high as are the heavens above the earth, So great is his mercy to them that fear him.
019	PSA	103	012	As far as the east is from the west, So far hath he removed our transgressions from us.
019	PSA	103	013	Even as a father pitieth his children, So the LORD pitieth them that fear him.
019	PSA	103	014	For he knoweth our frame, He remembereth that we are dust.
019	PSA	103	015	As for man, his days are as grass; As a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.
019	PSA	103	016	The wind passeth over it, and it is gone; And its place shall know it no more.
019	PSA	103	017	But the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting to them that fear him, And his righteousness to children's children,
019	PSA	103	018	To such as keep his covenant, And remember his commandments to do them.
019	PSA	103	019	The LORD hath established his throne in the heavens, And his kingdom ruleth over all.
019	PSA	103	020	Bless the LORD, ye his angels, Ye mighty ones who do his commands, Hearkening to the voice of his word!
019	PSA	103	021	Bless the LORD, all ye his hosts; Ye, his ministers, who do his pleasure!
019	PSA	103	022	Bless the LORD, all his works, In all places of his dominion! Bless the LORD, O my soul!
019	PSA	104	001	Bless the LORD, O my soul! O LORD, my God! thou art very great! Thou art clothed with glory and majesty!
019	PSA	104	002	He covereth himself with light as with a garment; He spreadeth out the heavens like a curtain;
019	PSA	104	003	He layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters; He maketh the clouds his chariot; He rideth upon the wings of the wind.
019	PSA	104	004	He maketh the winds his messengers, The flaming lightnings his ministers.
019	PSA	104	005	He established the earth on its foundations; It shall not be removed for ever.
019	PSA	104	006	Thou didst cover it with the deep as with a garment; The waters stood above the mountains!
019	PSA	104	007	At thy rebuke they fled; At the voice of thy thunder they hasted away.
019	PSA	104	008	The mountains rose, the valleys sank, In the place which thou didst appoint for them.
019	PSA	104	009	Thou hast established a bound which the waters may not pass, That they may not return, and cover the earth.
019	PSA	104	010	He sendeth forth the springs in brooks; They run among the mountains;
019	PSA	104	011	They give drink to all the beasts of the forest; In them the wild asses quench their thirst.
019	PSA	104	012	About them the birds of heaven have their habitation; They sing among the branches.
019	PSA	104	013	He watereth the hills from his chambers; The earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works!
019	PSA	104	014	He causeth grass to spring up for cattle, And herbage for the service of man, To bring forth food out of the earth,
019	PSA	104	015	And wine that gladdeneth the heart of man, Making his face to shine more than oil, And bread that strengtheneth man's heart.
019	PSA	104	016	The trees of the LORD are full of sap, The cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted;
019	PSA	104	017	There the birds build their nests; In the cypresses the stork hath her abode.
019	PSA	104	018	The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats, And the rocks for the conies.
019	PSA	104	019	He appointed the moon to mark seasons; The sun knoweth when to go down.
019	PSA	104	020	Thou makest darkness, and it is night, When all the beasts of the forest go forth!
019	PSA	104	021	The young lions roar for prey, And seek their food from God.
019	PSA	104	022	When the sun ariseth, they withdraw themselves, And lie down in their dens.
019	PSA	104	023	Man goeth forth to his work, And to his labor, until the evening.
019	PSA	104	024	O LORD! how manifold are thy works! In wisdom hast thou made them all! The earth is full of thy riches!
019	PSA	104	025	Lo! this great and wide sea! In it are moving creatures without number, Animals small and great.
019	PSA	104	026	There go the ships; There is the leviathan, which thou hast made to play therein.
019	PSA	104	027	All these wait on thee To give them their food in due season.
019	PSA	104	028	Thou givest it to them, they gather it; Thou openest thine hand, they are satisfied with good.
019	PSA	104	029	Thou hidest thy face, they are confounded; Thou takest away their breath, they die, And return to the dust.
019	PSA	104	030	Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created, And thou renewest the face of the earth.
019	PSA	104	031	The glory of the LORD shall endure for ever; The LORD shall rejoice in his works;
019	PSA	104	032	He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth; He toucheth the hills, and they smoke.
019	PSA	104	033	I will sing to the LORD as long as I live, I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.
019	PSA	104	034	May my meditation be acceptable to him! I will rejoice in the LORD.
019	PSA	104	035	May sinners perish from the earth, And the wicked be no more! Bless the LORD, O my soul! Praise ye the LORD!
019	PSA	105	001	O give thanks unto the LORD; Call upon his name; Make known his deeds among the people!
019	PSA	105	002	Sing unto him; sing psalms unto him; Tell ye of all his wondrous works!
019	PSA	105	003	Glory ye in his holy name; Let the hearts of them that seek the LORD rejoice!
019	PSA	105	004	Seek the LORD, and his majesty; Seek his face continually!
019	PSA	105	005	Remember the wonders he hath wrought, His miracles and the judgments of his mouth,
019	PSA	105	006	Ye offspring of Abraham his servant, Ye children of Jacob his chosen!
019	PSA	105	007	Jehovah, he is our God, His judgments are over all the earth.
019	PSA	105	008	He remembereth his covenant for ever, And the promise to a thousand generations;
019	PSA	105	009	The covenant which he made with Abraham, And the oath which he gave to Isaac;
019	PSA	105	010	Which he confirmed to Jacob for a decree, And to Israel for an everlasting covenant.
019	PSA	105	011	“To thee,” said he, “will I give the land of Canaan For the lot of your inheritance.”
019	PSA	105	012	When they were yet few in number, Very few, and strangers in the land;
019	PSA	105	013	When they went from nation to nation, From one kingdom to another people,
019	PSA	105	014	He suffered no man to oppress them; Yea, he rebuked kings for their sakes.
019	PSA	105	015	“Touch not,” said he, “mine anointed, And do my prophets no harm!”
019	PSA	105	016	Again, when he commanded a famine in the land, And broke the whole staff of bread,
019	PSA	105	017	He sent a man before them; Joseph was sold as a slave.
019	PSA	105	018	His feet they hurt with fetters; He was bound in chains of iron;
019	PSA	105	019	Until his prediction came to pass, And the word of the LORD proved him.
019	PSA	105	020	Then the king sent, and loosed him; The ruler of nations, and set him free;
019	PSA	105	021	He made him governor of his house, And lord of all his possessions;
019	PSA	105	022	To bind his princes at his pleasure, And teach his counsellors wisdom.
019	PSA	105	023	Israel also came into Egypt, And Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham;
019	PSA	105	024	Where God increased his people greatly, And made them stronger than their enemies.
019	PSA	105	025	He turned their hearts to hate his people, And form devices against his servants.
019	PSA	105	026	Then sent he Moses his servant, And Aaron, whom he had chosen.
019	PSA	105	027	They showed his signs among them, And his wonders in the land of Ham.
019	PSA	105	028	He sent darkness upon them, and made it dark; And they did not disobey his word.
019	PSA	105	029	He turned their waters into blood, And caused their fish to die.
019	PSA	105	030	Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, Even in the chambers of their kings.
019	PSA	105	031	He spake, and there came flies, And lice in all their coasts.
019	PSA	105	032	Instead of rain he gave them hail, And flaming fire in their land.
019	PSA	105	033	He smote also their vines and fig-trees, And broke the trees of their coasts.
019	PSA	105	034	He spake, and the locusts came. Destructive locusts without number,
019	PSA	105	035	Which ate up all the herbage in their land, And devoured the fruits of their fields.
019	PSA	105	036	Then he smote all the first-born in their land, The first-fruits of all their strength.
019	PSA	105	037	He led forth his people with silver and gold; Nor was there one feeble person in all their tribes.
019	PSA	105	038	Egypt was glad when they departed, For their terror had fallen upon them.
019	PSA	105	039	He spread out a cloud for a covering, And fire to give light by night.
019	PSA	105	040	They asked, and he brought quails, And satisfied them with the bread of heaven.
019	PSA	105	041	He opened the rock, and the waters gushed forth, And ran in the dry places like a river.
019	PSA	105	042	For he remembered his holy promise, Which he had made to Abraham his servant;
019	PSA	105	043	And he led forth his people with joy, And his chosen with gladness.
019	PSA	105	044	He gave to them the lands of the nations, And they inherited the labor of the peoples;
019	PSA	105	045	That they might observe his statutes, And obey his laws. Praise ye the LORD!
019	PSA	106	001	Praise ye the LORD! O give thanks to the LORD, for he is good; For his mercy endureth for ever!
019	PSA	106	002	Who can utter the mighty deeds of the LORD? Who can show forth all his praise?
019	PSA	106	003	Happy are they who have regard to justice, Who practise righteousness at all times!
019	PSA	106	004	Remember me, O LORD! with the favor promised to thy people; O visit me with thy salvation!
019	PSA	106	005	That I may see the prosperity of thy chosen, That I may rejoice in the joy of thy people, That I may glory with thine inheritance!
019	PSA	106	006	We have sinned with our fathers; We have committed iniquity; we have done wickedly.
019	PSA	106	007	Our fathers in Egypt did not regard thy wonders; They remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; But rebelled at the sea, the Red sea.
019	PSA	106	008	Yet he saved them for his own name's sake. That he might make his mighty power to be known.
019	PSA	106	009	He rebuked the Red sea, and it was dried up, And he led them through the deep as through a desert.
019	PSA	106	010	He saved them from the hand of him that hated them, And redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.
019	PSA	106	011	The waters covered their enemies; There was not one of them left.
019	PSA	106	012	Then believed they his words, And sang his praise.
019	PSA	106	013	But they soon forgot his deeds, And waited not for his counsel.
019	PSA	106	014	They gave way to appetite in the wilderness, And tempted God in the desert;
019	PSA	106	015	And he gave them their request, But sent upon them leanness.
019	PSA	106	016	They also envied Moses in the camp, And Aaron, the holy one of the LORD.
019	PSA	106	017	Then the earth opened, and swallowed up Dathan, And covered the company of Abiram,
019	PSA	106	018	And a fire was kindled in their company; The flames burned up the wicked.
019	PSA	106	019	They made a calf in Horeb, And worshipped a molten image;
019	PSA	106	020	They changed their God of glory Into the image of a grass-eating ox.
019	PSA	106	021	They forgot God, their saviour, Who had done such great things in Egypt,
019	PSA	106	022	Such wonders in the land of Ham. Such terrible things at the Red sea.
019	PSA	106	023	Then he said that he would destroy them; Had not Moses, his chosen, stood before him in the breach, To turn away his wrath, that he might not destroy them.
019	PSA	106	024	They also despised the pleasant land, And believed not his word;
019	PSA	106	025	But murmured in their tents, And would not hearken to the voice of the LORD.
019	PSA	106	026	Then he lifted up his hand against them, And swore that he would make them fall in the wilderness;
019	PSA	106	027	That he would overthrow their descendants among the nations, And scatter them in the lands.
019	PSA	106	028	They also gave themselves to the worship of Baal-peor, And ate sacrifices offered to lifeless idols.
019	PSA	106	029	Thus they provoked his anger by their practices, And a plague broke in upon them.
019	PSA	106	030	Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment, And the plague was stayed.
019	PSA	106	031	And this was counted to him for righteousness, To all generations for ever.
019	PSA	106	032	They provoked him also at the waters of Meribah [[strife]], And evil befell Moses on their account.
019	PSA	106	033	For they provoked his spirit, So that he spake inconsiderately with his lips.
019	PSA	106	034	They did not destroy the nations, As Jehovah had commanded them.
019	PSA	106	035	They mingled themselves with the peoples, And learned their practices.
019	PSA	106	036	They even worshipped their idols, Which became to them a snare.
019	PSA	106	037	Their sons and their daughters they sacrificed to demons,
019	PSA	106	038	And shed innocent blood, The blood of their own sons and daughters, Whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan; And the land was polluted with blood.
019	PSA	106	039	Thus they defiled themselves with their works, And played the harlot with their practices.
019	PSA	106	040	Then burned the anger of the LORD against his people, So that he abhorred his own inheritance.
019	PSA	106	041	And he gave them into the hand of the nations, And they who hated them ruled over them.
019	PSA	106	042	Their enemies oppressed them, And they were bowed down under their hand.
019	PSA	106	043	Many times did he deliver them; But they provoked him by their devices, And they were brought low for their iniquities.
019	PSA	106	044	Yet, when he heard their cries, He had regard to their affliction;
019	PSA	106	045	He remembered his covenant with them, And repented according to the greatness of his mercy,
019	PSA	106	046	And caused them to find pity Among all that carried them captive.
019	PSA	106	047	Save us, O Jehovah, our God! and gather us from among the nations, That we may give thanks to thy holy name, And glory in thy praise!
019	PSA	106	048	[Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, From everlasting to everlasting! And let all the people say, Amen! Praise ye Jehovah!]
019	PSA	107	001	“BOOK V.” O give thanks to the LORD, for he is good; For his mercy endureth for ever!
019	PSA	107	002	Let the redeemed of the LORD say it, Whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy;
019	PSA	107	003	Whom he hath gathered from the lands, From the east, the west, the north, and the south.
019	PSA	107	004	They were wandering in the wilderness, in a desert, They found no way to a city to dwell in.
019	PSA	107	005	They were hungry and thirsty, And their souls fainted within them.
019	PSA	107	006	Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, And he delivered them out of their distress.
019	PSA	107	007	He led them in a straight way, Till they came to a city where they might dwell.
019	PSA	107	008	O let them praise the LORD for his goodness, For his wonderful works to the children of men!
019	PSA	107	009	For he satisfieth the thirsty, And the hungry he filleth with good.
019	PSA	107	010	They dwelt in darkness and the shadow of death, Being bound in affliction and iron;
019	PSA	107	011	Because they disobeyed the commands of God, And contemned the will of the Most High;
019	PSA	107	012	Their hearts he brought down by hardship; They fell down, and there was none to help.
019	PSA	107	013	But they cried to the LORD in their trouble, And he saved them out of their distresses;
019	PSA	107	014	He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, And brake their bands asunder.
019	PSA	107	015	O let them praise the LORD for his goodness, For his wonderful works to the children of men!
019	PSA	107	016	For he hath broken the gates of brass, And cut the bars of iron asunder.
019	PSA	107	017	The foolish, because of their transgressions, And because of their iniquities, were afflicted;
019	PSA	107	018	They abhorred all kinds of food; They were near to the gates of death.
019	PSA	107	019	Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, And he delivered them out of their distresses;
019	PSA	107	020	He sent his word, and healed them, And saved them from their destruction.
019	PSA	107	021	O let them praise the LORD for his goodness, For his wonderful works to the children of men!
019	PSA	107	022	Let them offer the sacrifices of thanksgiving, And declare his works with joy!
019	PSA	107	023	They who go down to the sea in ships, And do business in great waters,
019	PSA	107	024	These see the works of the LORD, And his wonders in the deep.
019	PSA	107	025	He commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, Which lifteth high the waves.
019	PSA	107	026	They mount up to the heavens, They sink down to the depths, Their soul melteth with distress;
019	PSA	107	027	They reel and stagger like a drunken man, And all their skill is vain.
019	PSA	107	028	Then they cry to the LORD in their trouble, And he saveth them out of their distresses;
019	PSA	107	029	He turneth the storm into a calm, And the waves are hushed;
019	PSA	107	030	Then they rejoice that they are still, And he bringeth them to their desired haven.
019	PSA	107	031	O let them praise the LORD for his goodness. For his wonderful works to the children of men!
019	PSA	107	032	Let them extol him in the congregation of the people, And praise him in the assembly of the elders!
019	PSA	107	033	He turneth rivers into a desert, And springs of water into dry ground;
019	PSA	107	034	A fruitful land into barrenness, For the wickedness of them that dwell therein.
019	PSA	107	035	He turneth the desert into a lake of water, And dry ground into springs of water;
019	PSA	107	036	And there he causeth the hungry to dwell, And they build a city for a dwelling-place,
019	PSA	107	037	And sow fields and plant vineyards, Which yield a fruitful increase.
019	PSA	107	038	He blesseth them, so that they multiply greatly, And suffereth not their cattle to decrease.
019	PSA	107	039	When they are diminished and brought low By oppression, affliction, and sorrow,
019	PSA	107	040	He poureth contempt upon princes, And causeth them to wander in a pathless wilderness;
019	PSA	107	041	But he raiseth the poor from their affliction, And increaseth their families like a flock.
019	PSA	107	042	The righteous see it and rejoice, And all iniquity shutteth her mouth.
019	PSA	107	043	Whoso is wise, let him observe this, And have regard to the loving-kindness of the LORD!
019	PSA	108	001	“A psalm of David.” O God! my heart is strengthened! I will sing and give thanks.
019	PSA	108	002	Awake, my soul! awake, my psaltery and harp! I will wake with the early dawn.
019	PSA	108	003	I will praise thee, O LORD! among the nations; I will sing to thee among the peoples!
019	PSA	108	004	For thy mercy reacheth to the heavens, And thy truth above the clouds.
019	PSA	108	005	Exalt thyself, O God! above the heavens, And thy glory above all the earth!
019	PSA	108	006	That thy beloved ones may be delivered, Save with thy right hand, and answer me!
019	PSA	108	007	God promiseth in his holiness; I will rejoice; I shall yet divide Shechem, And measure out the valley of Succoth;
019	PSA	108	008	Gilead shall be mine, and mine Manasseh; Ephraim shall be my helmet, And Judah my sceptre.
019	PSA	108	009	Moab shall be my washbowl; Upon Edom shall I cast my shoe; I shall triumph over Philistia.
019	PSA	108	010	Who will bring me to the strong city? Who will lead me into Edom?
019	PSA	108	011	Wilt not thou, O God! who didst forsake us, Who didst not go forth with our armies?
019	PSA	108	012	Give us thine aid in our distress, For vain is the help of man!
019	PSA	108	013	Through God we shall do valiantly; For he will tread down our enemies.
019	PSA	109	001	“For the leader of the music. A psalm of David.” O God of my praise! be not silent!
019	PSA	109	002	For the mouths of the wicked and the deceitful are opened against me; They speak against me with a lying tongue.
019	PSA	109	003	They assault me on every side with words of hatred; They fight against me without a cause.
019	PSA	109	004	For my love they are my adversaries: But I give myself unto prayer.
019	PSA	109	005	They repay me evil for good, And hatred for love.
019	PSA	109	006	Set thou a wicked man over him, And let an adversary stand at his right hand!
019	PSA	109	007	When he is judged, may he be condemned, And may his prayer be a crime!
019	PSA	109	008	May his days be few, And another take his office!
019	PSA	109	009	May his children be fatherless, And his wife a widow!
019	PSA	109	010	May his children be vagabonds and beggars, And from their ruined dwellings seek their bread!
019	PSA	109	011	May a creditor seize on all that he hath, And a stranger plunder his substance!
019	PSA	109	012	May there be none to show him compassion, And none to pity his fatherless children!
019	PSA	109	013	May his posterity be cut off; In the next generation may his name be blotted out!
019	PSA	109	014	May the iniquity of his fathers be remembered by the LORD, And may the sin of his mother never be blotted out!
019	PSA	109	015	May they be before the LORD continually; And may he cut off their memory from the earth!
019	PSA	109	016	Because he remembered not to show pity, But persecuted the afflicted and the poor man, And sought the death of the broken-hearted.
019	PSA	109	017	As he loved cursing, let it come upon him; As he delighted not in blessing, let it be far from him!
019	PSA	109	018	May he be clothed with cursing as with a garment; May it enter like water into his bowels, And like oil into his bones!
019	PSA	109	019	May it be to him like the robe that covereth him, Like the girdle with which he is constantly girded!
019	PSA	109	020	May this be the wages of mine adversaries from the LORD, And of them that speak evil against me!
019	PSA	109	021	But do thou, O LORD, my God! take part with me, For thine own name's sake! Because great is thy mercy, O deliver me!
019	PSA	109	022	For I am afflicted and needy, And my heart is wounded within me.
019	PSA	109	023	I am going like a shadow; I am driven away as the locust.
019	PSA	109	024	My knees totter from fasting, And my flesh faileth of fatness.
019	PSA	109	025	I am a reproach to my enemies; They gaze at me; they shake their heads.
019	PSA	109	026	Help me, O LORD, my God! O save me, according to thy mercy!
019	PSA	109	027	That they may know that this is thy hand; That thou, O Lord! hast done it!
019	PSA	109	028	Let them curse, but do thou bless! When they arise, let them be put to shame; But let thy servant rejoice!
019	PSA	109	029	May my enemies be clothed with ignominy; May they be covered with their shame, as with a mantle!
019	PSA	109	030	I will earnestly praise the LORD with my lips; In the midst of the multitude I will praise him.
019	PSA	109	031	For he standeth at the right hand of the poor, To save him from those who would condemn him.
019	PSA	110	001	“A psalm of David.” Jehovah said to my lord, “Sit thou at my right hand, Until I make thy foes thy footstool.”
019	PSA	110	002	Jehovah will extend the sceptre of thy power from Zion: Rule thou in the midst of thine enemies!
019	PSA	110	003	Thy people shall be ready, when thou musterest thy forces, in holy splendor; Thy youth shall come forth like dew from the womb of the morning.
019	PSA	110	004	Jehovah hath sworn, and he will not repent: “Thou art a priest for ever, After the order of Melchisedeck!”
019	PSA	110	005	The Lord is at thy right hand, He shall crush kings in the day of his wrath.
019	PSA	110	006	He shall execute justice among the nations; He shall fill them with dead bodies, He shall crush the heads of his enemies over many lands.
019	PSA	110	007	He shall drink of the brook in the way; Therefore shall he lift up his head.
019	PSA	111	001	Praise ye the LORD! I will praise the LORD with my whole heart, In the assembly of the righteous, and in the congregation.
019	PSA	111	002	The works of the LORD are great, Sought out by all who have pleasure in them.
019	PSA	111	003	His deeds are honorable and glorious, And his righteousness endureth for ever.
019	PSA	111	004	He hath established a memorial of his wonders; The LORD is gracious and full of compassion.
019	PSA	111	005	He giveth meat to them that fear him; He is ever mindful of his covenant.
019	PSA	111	006	He showed his people the greatness of his works, When he gave them the inheritance of the heathen.
019	PSA	111	007	The deeds of his hands are truth and justice; All his commandments are sure;
019	PSA	111	008	They stand firm for ever and ever, Being founded in truth and justice.
019	PSA	111	009	He sent redemption to his people; He established his covenant for ever; Holy, and to be had in reverence, is his name.
019	PSA	111	010	The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom; A good understanding have all they who keep his commandments; His praise endureth for ever.
019	PSA	112	001	Praise ye the LORD! Happy the man who feareth the LORD, Who taketh delight in his commandments!
019	PSA	112	002	His posterity shall be mighty on the earth; The race of the righteous shall be blessed.

019	PSA	114	001	When Israel came forth from Egypt, The house of Jacob from a people of strange language,
019	PSA	114	002	Judah was his sanctuary, And Israel his dominion.

019	PSA	116	011	I said in my distress, “All men are liars.”
019	PSA	116	012	What shall I render to the LORD For all his benefits to me?
019	PSA	116	013	I will take the cup of salvation, And call upon the name of the LORD;
019	PSA	116	014	I will pay my vows to the LORD, In the presence of all his people.
019	PSA	116	015	Precious in the eyes of the LORD Is the death of his holy ones.
019	PSA	116	016	Hear, O LORD! for I am thy servant; I am thy servant, the son of thy handmaid! Thou hast loosed my bonds.
019	PSA	116	017	I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, And will call upon the name of the LORD.
019	PSA	116	018	I will pay my vows to the LORD In the presence of all his people,

019	PSA	118	005	I called upon the LORD in distress; He heard, and set me in a wide place.
019	PSA	118	006	The LORD is on my side, I will not fear: What can man do to me?
019	PSA	118	007	The LORD is my helper; I shall see my desire upon my enemies.
019	PSA	118	008	It is better to trust in the LORD Than to put confidence in man;
019	PSA	118	009	It is better to trust in the LORD Than to put confidence in princes.
019	PSA	118	010	All the nations beset me around, But in the name of the LORD I destroyed them.
019	PSA	118	011	They beset me on every side; But in the name of the LORD I destroyed them.

019	PSA	118	017	I shall not die, but live, And declare the deeds of the LORD.
019	PSA	118	018	The LORD hath sorely chastened me, But he hath not given me over to death.
019	PSA	118	019	Open to me the gates of righteousness, That I may go in, and praise the LORD!
019	PSA	118	020	This is the gate of the LORD, Through which the righteous enter.

019	PSA	119	147	I come before the dawn with my prayer; I trust in thy promise!
019	PSA	119	148	My eyes anticipate the night-watches, That I may meditate upon thy promise.
019	PSA	119	149	Hear my voice according to thy loving-kindness; O LORD! revive me according to thy mercy!
019	PSA	119	150	Near are they whose aim is mischief; They are far from thy law;
019	PSA	119	151	Yet thou art near, O LORD! And all thy commandments are truth!
019	PSA	119	152	Long have I known concerning thine ordinances, That thou hast founded them for ever.
019	PSA	119	153	Look upon my affliction, and deliver me! For I do not forget thy law.
019	PSA	119	154	Maintain my cause, and redeem me; Revive me according to thy promise!
019	PSA	119	155	Salvation is far from the wicked, Because they seek not thy statutes.
019	PSA	119	156	Great is thy compassion, O LORD! Revive thou me according to thine equity!
019	PSA	119	157	Many are my persecutors and my enemies, Yet do I not depart from thine ordinances.
019	PSA	119	158	I behold the transgressors, and am grieved Because they regard not thy word.
019	PSA	119	159	Behold, how I love thy precepts! O LORD! revive me according to thy loving-kindness!
019	PSA	119	160	The whole of thy word is truth, And all thy righteous judgments endure for ever.
019	PSA	119	161	Princes have persecuted me without cause; But my heart standeth in awe of thy word.
019	PSA	119	162	I rejoice in thy word, As one that hath found great spoil.
019	PSA	119	163	I hate and abhor lying, And thy law do I love.
019	PSA	119	164	Seven times a day do I praise thee On account of thy righteous judgments.
019	PSA	119	165	Great peace have they who love thy law, And no evil shall befall them.
019	PSA	119	166	O LORD! I wait for thy salvation, And keep thy commandments!
019	PSA	119	167	My soul observeth thine ordinances, And loveth them exceedingly.
019	PSA	119	168	I keep thy precepts and thine ordinances; For all my ways are before thee.
019	PSA	119	169	Let my prayer come near before thee, O LORD! According to thy promise, give me understanding!
019	PSA	119	170	Let my supplication come before thee; O deliver me according to thy promise!
019	PSA	119	171	My lips shall pour forth praise; For thou teachest me thy statutes.
019	PSA	119	172	My tongue shall sing of thy word; For all thy commandments are right.
019	PSA	119	173	Let thy hand be my help; For I have chosen thy precepts!
019	PSA	119	174	I long for thy salvation, O LORD! And thy law is my delight!
019	PSA	119	175	Let me live, and I will praise thee; Let thy judgments help me!
019	PSA	119	176	I wander like a lost sheep; seek thy servant, For I do not forget thy commandments!
019	PSA	120	001	“A psalm of steps.” In my distress I called upon the LORD, And he answered me.
019	PSA	120	002	O LORD! deliver me from lying lips, From the deceitful tongue!
019	PSA	120	003	What profit to thee, Or what advantage to thee, is the false tongue?
019	PSA	120	004	It is like the sharp arrows of the mighty man; Like coals of the juniper.
019	PSA	120	005	Alas for me, that I sojourn in Mesech, That I dwell in the tents of Kedar!
019	PSA	120	006	Too long have I dwelt With them that hate peace!
019	PSA	120	007	I am for peace; yet, when I speak for it, They are for war.
019	PSA	121	001	“A psalm of the steps, or the goings up.” I lift up mine eyes to the hills: Whence cometh my help?
019	PSA	121	002	My help cometh from the LORD, Who made heaven and earth.
019	PSA	121	003	He will not suffer thy foot to stumble; Thy guardian doth not slumber.
019	PSA	121	004	Behold, the guardian of Israel Doth neither slumber nor sleep.
019	PSA	121	005	The LORD is thy guardian; The LORD is thy shade at thy right hand.
019	PSA	121	006	The sun shall not smite thee by day, Nor the moon by night.
019	PSA	121	007	The LORD will preserve thee from all evil; He will preserve thy life.
019	PSA	121	008	The LORD will preserve thee, when thou goest out and when thou comest in, From this time forth for ever.
019	PSA	122	001	“A psalm of the steps, or the goings up. By David.” I was glad when they said to me, Let us go up to the house of the LORD!
019	PSA	122	002	Our feet are standing Within thy gates, O Jerusalem!
019	PSA	122	003	Jerusalem, the rebuilt city! The city that is joined together!
019	PSA	122	004	Thither the tribes go up, The tribes of the LORD, according to the law of Israel, To praise the name of the LORD.
019	PSA	122	005	There stand the thrones of judgment, The thrones of the house of David.
019	PSA	122	006	Pray for the peace of Jerusalem! May they prosper who love thee!
019	PSA	122	007	Peace be within thy walls, And prosperity within thy palaces!
019	PSA	122	008	For my brethren and companions' sake will I say, Peace be within thee!
019	PSA	122	009	For the sake of the house of the LORD, our God, Will I seek thy good!
019	PSA	123	001	“A song of the steps, or the goings up.” To thee do I lift up mine eyes, O Thou who dwellest in the heavens!
019	PSA	123	002	Behold, as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their masters, And as the eyes of a maiden to the hand of her mistress, So do our eyes look to the LORD, our God, Until he have pity upon us.
019	PSA	123	003	Have mercy upon us, O LORD! have mercy upon us, For we are overwhelmed with contempt!
019	PSA	123	004	Our soul is filled to the full with the scorn of those who are at ease, And with the contempt of the proud.
019	PSA	124	001	“A psalm of the steps, or the goings up. By David.” If the LORD had not been for us, Now may Israel say,
019	PSA	124	002	If the LORD had not been for us, When men rose up against us,
019	PSA	124	003	Then had they swallowed us up alive, When their wrath burned against us;
019	PSA	124	004	Then the waters had overwhelmed us; The stream had gone over our soul;
019	PSA	124	005	The proud waters had gone over our soul.
019	PSA	124	006	Blessed be the LORD, Who hath not given us a prey to their teeth!
019	PSA	124	007	We have escaped like a bird from the snare of the fowler; The snare is broken, and we have escaped.
019	PSA	124	008	Our help is in the name of the LORD, Who made heaven and earth.
019	PSA	125	001	“A psalm of the steps, or the goings up.” They who trust in the LORD shall be as Mount Zion, Which cannot be moved, which standeth for ever.
019	PSA	125	002	As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, So the LORD is round about his people, Henceforth even for ever!
019	PSA	125	003	For the sceptre of the wicked shall not remain upon the portion of the righteous, Lest the righteous put forth their hands to iniquity.
019	PSA	125	004	Do good, O LORD! to the good, To them that are upright in heart!
019	PSA	125	005	But such as turn aside to their crooked ways, -May the LORD destroy them with the evil-doers! Peace be to Israel!
019	PSA	126	001	“A psalm of the steps, or the goings up.” When the LORD brought back the captivity of Zion, We were like them that dream.
019	PSA	126	002	Then was our mouth filled with laughter, And our tongue with singing. Then said they among the nations, “The LORD hath done great things for them!”
019	PSA	126	003	Yea, the LORD hath done great things for us, For which we are glad.
019	PSA	126	004	Bring back, O LORD! our captivity, Like streams in the South!
019	PSA	126	005	They who sow in tears Shall reap in joy.
019	PSA	126	006	Yea, he goeth forth weeping, bearing his seed; He shall surely come back rejoicing, bearing his sheaves.
019	PSA	127	001	“A psalm of the steps, or the goings up. By Solomon.” Except the LORD build the house, The builders labor in vain; Except the LORD guard the city, The watchman waketh in vain.
019	PSA	127	002	In vain ye rise up early, and go to rest late, And eat the bread of care! The same giveth he his beloved one in sleep.
019	PSA	127	003	Behold! sons are an inheritance from the LORD, And the fruit of the womb is his gift.
019	PSA	127	004	As arrows in the hand of the warrior, So are the sons of young men:
019	PSA	127	005	Happy the man that hath his quiver full of them! They shall not be put to shame, When they speak with adversaries in the gate.
019	PSA	128	001	“A psalm of the steps, or the goings up.” Happy is he who feareth the LORD, Who walketh in his ways!
019	PSA	128	002	Thou shalt eat the labor of thy hands; Happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee!
019	PSA	128	003	Thy wife shall be like a fruitful vine within thy house; Thy children like olive-branches round about thy table.
019	PSA	128	004	Behold! thus happy is the man who feareth the LORD!
019	PSA	128	005	Jehovah shall bless thee out of Zion, And thou shalt see the prosperity of Jerusalem all the days of thy life;
019	PSA	128	006	Yea, thou shalt see thy children's children. Peace be to Israel!
019	PSA	129	001	“A psalm of the steps, or the goings up.” Much have they afflicted me from my youth, May Israel now say;
019	PSA	129	002	Much have they afflicted me from my youth, Yet have they not prevailed against me.
019	PSA	129	003	The ploughers ploughed up my back; They made long their furrows;
019	PSA	129	004	But the LORD was righteous; He cut asunder the cords of the wicked.
019	PSA	129	005	Let all be driven back with shame Who hate Zion!
019	PSA	129	006	Let them be as grass upon the house-tops, Which withereth before one pulleth it up;
019	PSA	129	007	With which the reaper filleth not his hand, Nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom!
019	PSA	129	008	And they who pass by do not say, “The blessing of the LORD be upon you! We bless you in the name of the LORD!”
019	PSA	130	001	“A psalm of the steps, or the goings up.” Out of the depths do I cry to thee, O LORD!
019	PSA	130	002	O Lord! listen to my voice, Let thine ears be attentive to my supplication!
019	PSA	130	003	If thou, LORD, shouldst treasure up transgressions, Lord, who could stand?
019	PSA	130	004	But with thee is forgiveness, That thou mayst be feared.
019	PSA	130	005	I trust in the LORD; my soul doth trust, And in his promise do I confide.
019	PSA	130	006	My soul waiteth for the LORD More than they who watch for the morning; Yea, more than they who watch for the morning!
019	PSA	130	007	O Israel! trust in the LORD! For with the LORD is mercy, And with him is plenteous redemption.
019	PSA	130	008	He will redeem Israel From all his iniquities.
019	PSA	131	001	“A psalm of the steps, or the goings up. Of David.” O LORD! my heart is not haughty, nor my eyes lofty; I employ not myself on great things, or things too wonderful for me!
019	PSA	131	002	Yea, I have stilled and quieted my soul As a weaned child upon his mother; My soul within me is like a weaned child.
019	PSA	131	003	O Israel! trust in the LORD, Henceforth even for ever!
019	PSA	132	001	“A psalm of the steps, or the goings up.” O LORD! remember David, And all his affliction!
019	PSA	132	002	How he sware to Jehovah, And vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob:
019	PSA	132	003	“I will not go into my house, Nor lie down on my bed,
019	PSA	132	004	I will not give sleep to my eyes, Nor slumber to my eyelids,
019	PSA	132	005	Until I find a place for Jehovah, A habitation for the Mighty One of Jacob.”
019	PSA	132	006	Behold, we heard of it at Ephratah; We found it in the fields of the forest.
019	PSA	132	007	Let us go into his habitation; Let us worship at his footstool!
019	PSA	132	008	Arise, O LORD! into thy rest, Thou, and the ark of thy strength!
019	PSA	132	009	Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness, And thy holy ones shout for joy!
019	PSA	132	010	For the sake of thy servant David, Reject not the prayer of thine anointed!
019	PSA	132	011	Jehovah hath sworn in truth unto David, And he will not depart from it: “Of the fruit of thy body will I place upon the throne for thee.
019	PSA	132	012	If thy children keep my covenant, And my statutes, which I teach them, Their children also throughout all ages Shall sit upon thy throne.”
019	PSA	132	013	For Jehovah hath chosen Zion; He hath desired it as his dwelling-place.
019	PSA	132	014	“This is my resting-place for ever; Here will I dwell, for I have chosen it.
019	PSA	132	015	I will abundantly bless her provision; I will satisfy her poor with bread.
019	PSA	132	016	I will also clothe her priests with salvation, And her holy ones shall shout aloud for joy.
019	PSA	132	017	There will I cause to spring forth a horn for David; I have prepared a light for mine anointed.
019	PSA	132	018	His enemies will I clothe with shame, And the crown shall glitter upon his head.”
019	PSA	133	001	“A psalm of the steps, or the goings up. By David.” Behold, how good and pleasant it is For brethren to dwell together in unity!
019	PSA	133	002	It is like precious perfume upon the head, Which ran down upon the beard, The beard of Aaron; Which went down to the very border of his garments;
019	PSA	133	003	Like the dew of Hermon, Like that which descendeth upon the mountains of Zion. For there the LORD commandeth a blessing, Even life for evermore.
019	PSA	134	001	“A psalm of the steps, or the goings up.” Praise the LORD, all ye servants of the LORD, Who stand in the house of the LORD by night!
019	PSA	134	002	Lift up your hands to the sanctuary, And praise the LORD!
019	PSA	134	003	May the LORD, who made heaven and earth, Bless thee out of Zion!
019	PSA	135	001	Praise ye the LORD! Praise ye the name of the LORD! Praise him, O ye servants of the LORD!
019	PSA	135	002	Ye who stand in the house of the LORD, In the courts of the house of our God!
019	PSA	135	003	Praise ye the LORD, for the LORD is good; Praise his name, for he is kind!
019	PSA	135	004	For the LORD chose Jacob for himself, And Israel for his own possession.
019	PSA	135	005	I know that the LORD is great; That our Lord is above all gods.
019	PSA	135	006	All that the LORD pleaseth, that he doeth, In heaven and upon earth, In the sea, and in all deeps.
019	PSA	135	007	He causeth the clouds to ascend from the ends of the earth; He maketh lightnings for the rain; He bringeth the wind from his store-houses.
019	PSA	135	008	He smote the first-born of Egypt, Both of man and beast.
019	PSA	135	009	He sent signs and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt! Against Pharaoh and all his servants!
019	PSA	135	010	He smote many nations, And slew mighty kings;
019	PSA	135	011	Sihon, the king of the Amorites, And Og, the king of Bashan, And all the kings of Canaan;
019	PSA	135	012	And gave their land for an inheritance, For an inheritance to Israel, his people.
019	PSA	135	013	Thy name, O LORD! endureth for ever; Thy memorial, O LORD! to all generations!
019	PSA	135	014	For the LORD judgeth his people, And hath compassion on his servants.
019	PSA	135	015	The idols of the nations are silver and gold, The work of men's hands.
019	PSA	135	016	They have mouths, but they speak not; Eyes have they, but they see not.
019	PSA	135	017	They have ears, but they hear not; And there is no breath in their mouths.
019	PSA	135	018	They that make them are like them; So is every one that trusteth in them.
019	PSA	135	019	Praise the LORD, O house of Israel! Praise the LORD, O house of Aaron!
019	PSA	135	020	Praise the LORD, O house of Levi! Ye that fear the LORD, bless the LORD!
019	PSA	135	021	Praised be the LORD out of Zion, He that dwelleth in Jerusalem! Praise ye the LORD!
019	PSA	136	001	O give thanks to the LORD! for he is kind; For his goodness endureth for ever!
019	PSA	136	002	O give thanks to the God of gods; For his goodness endureth for ever!
019	PSA	136	003	O give thanks to the Lord of lords; For his goodness endureth for ever!
019	PSA	136	004	To him that alone doeth great wonders; For his goodness endureth for ever!
019	PSA	136	005	To him that made the heavens with wisdom; For his goodness endureth for ever!
019	PSA	136	006	To him that spread out the earth upon the waters; For his goodness endureth for ever!
019	PSA	136	007	To him that made the great lights; For his goodness endureth for ever!
019	PSA	136	008	The sun to rule the day; For his goodness endureth for ever!
019	PSA	136	009	The moon and stars to rule the night; For his goodness endureth for ever!
019	PSA	136	010	To him that smote in Egypt their first-born; For his goodness endureth for ever!
019	PSA	136	011	And brought Israel from the midst of them; For his goodness endureth for ever!
019	PSA	136	012	With a strong hand and an outstretched arm; For his goodness endureth for ever!
019	PSA	136	013	To him who divided the Red sea into parts; For his goodness endureth for ever!
019	PSA	136	014	And made Israel to pass through the midst of it; For his goodness endureth for ever!
019	PSA	136	015	And overthrew Pharaoh and his host in the Red sea; For his goodness endureth for ever!
019	PSA	136	016	To him who led his people through the wilderness; For his goodness endureth for ever!
019	PSA	136	017	To him who smote great kings; For his goodness endureth for ever!
019	PSA	136	018	And slew mighty kings; For his goodness endureth for ever!
019	PSA	136	019	Sihon, the king of the Amorites; For his goodness endureth for ever!
019	PSA	136	020	And Og, the king of Bashan; For his goodness endureth for ever!
019	PSA	136	021	And gave their land for an inheritance; For his goodness endureth for ever!
019	PSA	136	022	For an inheritance to Israel his servant; For his goodness endureth for ever!
019	PSA	136	023	Who remembered us in our low estate; For his goodness endureth for ever!
019	PSA	136	024	And redeemed us from our enemies; For his goodness endureth for ever!
019	PSA	136	025	Who giveth food unto all; For his goodness endureth for ever!
019	PSA	136	026	O give thanks to the God of heaven; For his goodness endureth for ever!
019	PSA	137	001	By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, When we remembered Zion.
019	PSA	137	002	We hung our harps on the willows in the midst thereof.
019	PSA	137	003	For there they who carried us away captive required of us a song; They who wasted us required of us mirth: “Sing us one of the songs of Zion!”
019	PSA	137	004	How shall we sing the LORD'S song In a strange land?
019	PSA	137	005	If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, Let my right hand forget her cunning!
019	PSA	137	006	If I do not remember thee, Let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth; If I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy!
019	PSA	137	007	Remember, O LORD! against the children of Edom The day of the calamity of Jerusalem! Who said, “Raze it, Raze it to its foundations!”
019	PSA	137	008	O daughter of Babylon, thou destroyer! Happy be he who requiteth thee As thou hast dealt with us!
019	PSA	137	009	Happy be he who seizeth thy little ones And dasheth them against the stones!
019	PSA	138	001	“A psalm of David.” I will praise thee with my whole heart; Before the gods will I sing praise to thee;
019	PSA	138	002	I will worship toward thy holy temple, And praise thy name for thy goodness and thy truth; For thy promise thou hast magnified above all thy name!
019	PSA	138	003	In the day when I called, thou didst hear me; Thou didst strengthen me, and encourage my soul.
019	PSA	138	004	All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O LORD! When they hear the promises of thy mouth!
019	PSA	138	005	Yea, they shall sing of the ways of the LORD; For great is the glory of the LORD.
019	PSA	138	006	The LORD is high, yet he looketh upon the humble, And the proud doth he know from afar.
019	PSA	138	007	Though I walk through the midst of trouble, thou wilt revive me; Thou wilt stretch forth thy hand against the wrath of my enemies; Thou wilt save me by thy right hand!
019	PSA	138	008	The LORD will perform all things for me; Thy goodness, O LORD! endureth ever: Forsake not the works of thine hands!
019	PSA	139	001	“For the leader of the music. A psalm of David.” O LORD! thou hast searched me and known me!
019	PSA	139	002	Thou knowest my sitting-down and my rising-up; Thou understandest my thoughts from afar!
019	PSA	139	003	Thou seest my path and my lying-down, And art acquainted with all my ways!
019	PSA	139	004	For before the word is upon my tongue, Behold, O LORD! thou knowest it altogether!
019	PSA	139	005	Thou besettest me behind and before, And layest thine hand upon me!
019	PSA	139	006	Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; It is high, I cannot attain to it!
019	PSA	139	007	Whither shall I go from thy spirit, And whither shall I flee from thy presence?
019	PSA	139	008	If I ascend into heaven, thou art there! If I make my bed in the underworld, behold, thou art there!
019	PSA	139	009	If I take the wings of the morning, And dwell in the remotest parts of the sea,
019	PSA	139	010	Even there shall thy hand lead me, And thy right hand shall hold me!
019	PSA	139	011	If I say, “Surely the darkness shall cover me;” Even the night shall be light about me.
019	PSA	139	012	Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee, But the night shineth as the day; The darkness and the light are both alike to thee!
019	PSA	139	013	For thou didst form my reins; Thou didst weave me in my mother's womb.
019	PSA	139	014	I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made; Marvellous are thy works, And this my soul knoweth full well!
019	PSA	139	015	My frame was not hidden from thee, When I was made in secret. When I was curiously wrought in the lower parts of the earth.
019	PSA	139	016	Thine eyes did see my substance, while yet unformed, And in thy book was every thing written; My days were appointed before one of them existed.
019	PSA	139	017	How precious to me are thy thoughts, O God! How great is the sum of them!
019	PSA	139	018	If I should count them, they would outnumber the sand: When I awake, I am still with thee!
019	PSA	139	019	O that thou wouldst slay the wicked, O God! Ye men of blood, depart from me!
019	PSA	139	020	For they speak against thee wickedly; Thine enemies utter thy name for falsehood.
019	PSA	139	021	Do I not hate them that hate thee, O LORD? Do I not abhor them that rise up against thee?
019	PSA	139	022	Yea, I hate them with perfect hatred; I count them mine enemies.
019	PSA	139	023	Search me, O God! and know my heart; Try me, and know my thoughts;
019	PSA	139	024	And see if the way of trouble be within me, And lead me in the way everlasting!
019	PSA	140	001	“For the leader of the music. A psalm of David.” Deliver me, O LORD! from the evil man, Save me from the man of violence,
019	PSA	140	002	Who meditate mischief in their heart, And daily stir up war!
019	PSA	140	003	They sharpen their tongues like a serpent; The poison of the adder is under their lips. (Pause)
019	PSA	140	004	Defend me, O LORD! from the hands of the wicked, Preserve me from the man of violence, Who have purposed to cause my fall! (Pause)
019	PSA	140	005	The proud have hidden snares and cords for me; They have spread a net by the way-side; They have set traps for me.
019	PSA	140	006	I say to Jehovah, Thou art my God; Hear, O Jehovah! the voice of my supplication!
019	PSA	140	007	The Lord Jehovah is my saving strength: Thou shelterest my head in the day of battle!
019	PSA	140	008	Grant not, O LORD! the desires of the wicked; Let not their devices prosper; Let them not exalt themselves!
019	PSA	140	009	As for the heads of those who encompass me, Let the mischief of their own lips cover them!
019	PSA	140	010	Let burning coals fall upon them; May they be cast into the fire, And into deep waters from which they shall not arise!
019	PSA	140	011	The slanderer shall not be established upon the earth; Evil shall pursue the violent man to destruction.
019	PSA	140	012	I know that the LORD will maintain the cause of the afflicted, And the right of the poor.
019	PSA	140	013	Yea, the righteous shall praise thy name; The upright shall dwell in thy presence!
019	PSA	141	001	“For the leader of the music. A psalm of David.” I cry to thee, O LORD! make haste unto me! Give ear to my voice, when I cry unto thee!
019	PSA	141	002	Let my prayer come before thee as incense, And the lifting-up of my hands, as the evening sacrifice!
019	PSA	141	003	Set a watch, O LORD! before my mouth; Guard the door of my lips!
019	PSA	141	004	Let not my heart incline to any evil thing; Let me not practise wickedness with the doers of iniquity, And let me not eat of their delicacies!
019	PSA	141	005	Let the righteous smite me, —it shall be a kindness; Let him reprove me, and it shall be oil for my head; Let him do it again, and my head shall not refuse it; But now I pray against their wickedness!
019	PSA	141	006	When their judges are hurled over the side of the rock, They shall hear how pleasant are my words.

019	PSA	141	009	Preserve me from the snares which they have laid for me, And from the nets of evil-doers!
019	PSA	141	010	Let the wicked fall together into their own traps, Whilst I make my escape!
019	PSA	142	001	“A psalm of David; a prayer, when he was in the cave” I cry unto the LORD with my voice; With my voice to the LORD do I make my supplication.
019	PSA	142	002	I pour out my complaint before him; I declare before him my distress.
019	PSA	142	003	When my spirit is overwhelmed within me, Thou knowest my path! In the way which I walk, they have hid a snare for me.
019	PSA	142	004	I look on my right hand, and behold, But no man knoweth me; Refuge faileth me; No one careth for me.
019	PSA	142	005	I cry unto thee, O LORD! I say, Thou art my refuge, My portion in the land of the living.
019	PSA	142	006	Attend to my cry, for I am brought very low; Deliver me from my persecutors, For they prevail against me!
019	PSA	142	007	Bring me out of prison, That I may praise thy name! The righteous shall gather around me, When thou shalt show me thy favor.
019	PSA	143	001	“A psalm of David.” Hear my prayer, O LORD! give ear to my supplications! In thy faithfulness, and in thy righteousness, answer me!
019	PSA	143	002	Enter not into judgment with thy servant; For before thee no man living is righteous.
019	PSA	143	003	For the enemy pursueth my life; He hath smitten me to the ground; He hath made me dwell in darkness, As those that have been dead of old.
019	PSA	143	004	My spirit is overwhelmed within me; My heart within me is desolate.
019	PSA	143	005	I remember the days of old; I meditate on all thy works; I muse on the deeds of thy hands.
019	PSA	143	006	I stretch forth my hands unto thee; My soul thirsteth for thee, like a parched land.
019	PSA	143	007	Hear me speedily, O LORD! My spirit faileth; Hide not thy face from me. Lest I become like those who go down to the pit!
019	PSA	143	008	Cause me so see thy loving-kindness speedily; For in thee do I trust! Make known to me the way which I should take; For to thee do I lift up my soul!
019	PSA	143	009	Deliver me, O LORD! from mine enemies; For in thee do I seek refuge!
019	PSA	143	010	Teach me to do thy will; For thou art my God! Let thy good spirit lead me in a plain path!
019	PSA	143	011	Revive me, O LORD! for thy name's sake! In thy righteousness, bring me out of my distress!
019	PSA	143	012	And, in thy compassion, cut off mine enemies, And destroy all that distress me! For I am thy servant.

019	PSA	144	007	Send forth thine hand from above; Rescue and save me from deep waters; From the hands of aliens,
019	PSA	144	008	Whose mouth uttereth deceit, And whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood!
019	PSA	144	009	I will sing to thee a new song, O God! Upon a ten-stringed psaltery will I sing praise to thee;

# BOOK	020	PRO	Proverbs	Proverbs
020	PRO	001	001	The proverbs of Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel:
020	PRO	001	002	That one may learn wisdom and instruction, And receive words of understanding;
020	PRO	001	003	That one may gain the instruction of prudence, Justice, equity, and uprightness;
020	PRO	001	004	Which will give caution to the simple, To the young man wisdom and discretion;
020	PRO	001	005	Let the wise man hear, and he will increase his knowledge, And the man of understanding will gain wise counsels;
020	PRO	001	006	So as to understand a proverb and a deep maxim, The words of the wise and their dark sayings.
020	PRO	001	007	The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge; Fools despise wisdom and instruction.
020	PRO	001	008	Hear, O my son! the instruction of thy father, And neglect not the teaching of thy mother!
020	PRO	001	009	For they shall be a graceful wreath for thy head, And a chain around thy neck.
020	PRO	001	010	My son, if sinners entice thee, Consent thou not!
020	PRO	001	011	If they say, “Come with us, Let us lie in wait for blood, Let us lurk secretly for him who is innocent in vain;
020	PRO	001	012	Let us swallow them up alive, like the underworld, Yea, in full health, as those that go down into the pit;
020	PRO	001	013	We shall find all kinds of precious substance, We shall fill our houses with spoil;
020	PRO	001	014	Thou shalt cast thy lot among us; We will all have one purse;”—
020	PRO	001	015	My son, walk thou not in their way, Refrain thy foot from their path!
020	PRO	001	016	For their feet run to evil, And make haste to shed blood.
020	PRO	001	017	For as the net is spread in vain Before the eyes of any bird,
020	PRO	001	018	So they lie in wait for their own blood; They lurk secretly for their own lives.
020	PRO	001	019	Such are the ways of every one greedy of unjust gain; It taketh away the life of the possessor thereof.
020	PRO	001	020	Wisdom crieth out in the highway; In the market-place she uttereth her voice;
020	PRO	001	021	At the head of the noisy streets she crieth aloud; At the entrances of the gates, throughout the city, she proclaimeth her words [[saying]]:
020	PRO	001	022	How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? How long will scoffers delight themselves in scoffing, And fools hate knowledge?
020	PRO	001	023	Turn ye at my reproof! Behold, I will pour out my spirit to you; I will make known my words to you!
020	PRO	001	024	“Because I have called, and ye have refused, —Because I have stretched out my hand, and no one hath regarded.
020	PRO	001	025	Because ye have rejected all my counsel, And have slighted my rebuke, —
020	PRO	001	026	I also will laugh at your calamity, I will mock when your fear cometh;
020	PRO	001	027	When your fear cometh upon you like a storm. And destruction overtaketh you like a whirlwind, When distress and anguish come upon you.
020	PRO	001	028	Then will they call upon me, but I will not answer! They will seek me early, But they shall not find me!
020	PRO	001	029	Because they have hated knowledge, And have not chosen the fear of the LORD, —
020	PRO	001	030	Because they would not attend to my counsel, And have despised all my reproof, —
020	PRO	001	031	Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, And be filled to the full with their own devices;
020	PRO	001	032	Yea, the turning away of the simple shall slay them, And the carelessness of fools shall destroy them.
020	PRO	001	033	But whoso hearkeneth to me shall dwell securely, And shall not be disquieted with the fear of evil.”
020	PRO	002	001	Oh, my son, that thou wouldst receive my words, And treasure up my precepts within thee;
020	PRO	002	002	That thou wouldst apply thine ear to wisdom, And incline thy heart to understanding!
020	PRO	002	003	For if thou wilt call aloud to knowledge, And lift up thy voice to understanding, —
020	PRO	002	004	If thou wilt seek her as silver, And search for her as for hidden treasures,
020	PRO	002	005	Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, And find the knowledge of God.
020	PRO	002	006	For the LORD giveth wisdom; From his mouth proceed knowledge and understanding:
020	PRO	002	007	He layeth up safety for the righteous; He is a shield to them that walk uprightly:
020	PRO	002	008	He guardeth the paths of equity, And defendeth the way of his servants.
020	PRO	002	009	Then shalt thou understand righteousness and equity And uprightness, yea, every good path.
020	PRO	002	010	When wisdom entereth into thy heart, And knowledge is pleasant to thy soul,
020	PRO	002	011	Discretion will guard thee, Understanding will preserve thee.
020	PRO	002	012	It will deliver thee from the way of the wicked, From the men who speak perverse things;
020	PRO	002	013	Who forsake the paths of uprightness, To walk in the ways of darkness;
020	PRO	002	014	Who rejoice in doing evil, And delight in the perverseness of the wicked;
020	PRO	002	015	Whose paths are crooked, And who are froward in their ways.
020	PRO	002	016	It will deliver thee from the wife of another, From the stranger, who useth smooth words;
020	PRO	002	017	Who forsaketh the friend of her youth, And forgetteth the covenant of her God.
020	PRO	002	018	For her house sinketh down to Death, And her paths to the shades of the dead:
020	PRO	002	019	None that go to her return again; They will not attain the paths of life.
020	PRO	002	020	Therefore walk thou in the way of good men, And keep the paths of the righteous:
020	PRO	002	021	For the upright shall dwell in the land, And the righteous shall remain in it;
020	PRO	002	022	But the wicked shall be cut off from the land, And transgressors shall be rooted out of it.
020	PRO	003	001	My son, forget not my teaching, And let thy heart observe my precepts!
020	PRO	003	002	For length of days, and years of life, And peace shall they multiply to thee.
020	PRO	003	003	Let not kindness and truth forsake thee; Bind them around thy neck, Write them upon the tablet of thy heart:
020	PRO	003	004	Then shalt thou find favor and good success In the sight of God and man.
020	PRO	003	005	Trust in the LORD with all thy heart, And lean not on thine own understanding;
020	PRO	003	006	In all thy ways acknowledge him, And he will make thy paths plain.
020	PRO	003	007	Be not wise in thine own eyes; Fear the LORD, and depart from evil.
020	PRO	003	008	It shall be health to thy muscles, And moisture to thy bones.
020	PRO	003	009	Honor the LORD with thy substance, And with the first-fruits of all thy increase;
020	PRO	003	010	So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, And thy vats overflow with new wine.
020	PRO	003	011	My son, despise not the correction of the LORD, Nor be impatient under his chastisement!
020	PRO	003	012	For whom the LORD loveth he chasteneth, Even as a father the son in whom he delighteth.
020	PRO	003	013	Happy the man who findeth wisdom; Yea, the man who getteth understanding!
020	PRO	003	014	For the profit thereof is greater than that of silver, And the gain thereof than that of fine gold.
020	PRO	003	015	More precious is she than pearls, And none of thy jewels is to be compared with her.
020	PRO	003	016	Length of days is in her right hand; In her left hand are riches and honor.
020	PRO	003	017	Her ways are ways of pleasantness, And all her paths are peace.
020	PRO	003	018	She is a tree of life to them that lay hold of her, And happy is every one who hath her in his grasp.
020	PRO	003	019	The LORD by wisdom founded the earth; By understanding he framed the heavens.
020	PRO	003	020	By his knowledge the deep waters were cleft, And the clouds drop down the dew.
020	PRO	003	021	My son, let them not depart from thine eyes; Keep sound wisdom and discretion!
020	PRO	003	022	For they shall be life to thy soul, And grace to thy neck.
020	PRO	003	023	Then shalt thou go on thy way securely, And thy foot shall not stumble;
020	PRO	003	024	When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid, Yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.
020	PRO	003	025	Be not thou afraid of sudden alarm, Nor of the storm that is for the wicked, when it cometh;
020	PRO	003	026	For the LORD shall be thy confidence; Yea, he will keep thy foot from being taken.
020	PRO	003	027	Withhold not kindness from those who need it, When it is in the power of thy hand to do it.
020	PRO	003	028	Say not to thy neighbor, “Go, and come again, And to-morrow I will give to thee,” when thou hast it by thee.
020	PRO	003	029	Devise not evil against thy neighbor, While he dwelleth securely by thee.
020	PRO	003	030	Contend not with a man without cause, When he hath done thee no harm.
020	PRO	003	031	Envy not the oppressor, And choose none of his ways.
020	PRO	003	032	For the perverse man is the abomination of the LORD, But he is in friendship with the upright.
020	PRO	003	033	The curse of the LORD is upon the house of the wicked, But he blesseth the dwelling of the righteous.
020	PRO	003	034	Surely the scorners he treadeth scornfully, But giveth favor to the lowly.
020	PRO	003	035	The wise shall obtain honor, But fools shall bear off shame.
020	PRO	004	001	Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, And attend, that ye may learn understanding!
020	PRO	004	002	For I give you good instruction; Forsake ye not my commandments.
020	PRO	004	003	For I was my father's son, A tender and only child in the sight of my mother.
020	PRO	004	004	He taught me, and said to me, Let thy heart hold fast my words; Keep my commandments, and live.
020	PRO	004	005	Get wisdom, get understanding; Forget not, and depart not from, the words of my mouth.
020	PRO	004	006	Forsake her not, and she will guard thee: Love her, and she will preserve thee.
020	PRO	004	007	Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore gain wisdom, And with all thy gain, gain understanding.
020	PRO	004	008	Exalt her, and she will promote thee; She will bring thee to honor, when thou dost embrace her;
020	PRO	004	009	She will give to thy head a graceful wreath, A beautiful crown will she bestow upon thee.
020	PRO	004	010	Hear, O my son! and receive my sayings! So shall the years of thy life be many.
020	PRO	004	011	I have taught thee the way of wisdom, I have guided thee in the right path.
020	PRO	004	012	When thou goest, thy steps shall not be confined; And, when thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.
020	PRO	004	013	Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go; Keep her, for she is thy life.
020	PRO	004	014	Enter not into the path of the wicked, And go not in the way of evil men;
020	PRO	004	015	Avoid it, pass not upon it, Turn from it, and go away.
020	PRO	004	016	For they sleep not, unless they have done mischief; Yea, their sleep is taken away, unless they have caused some to fall.
020	PRO	004	017	For they eat the bread of wickedness, And drink the wine of violence.
020	PRO	004	018	But the path of the righteous is as the light of dawn, Which groweth brighter and brighter unto the perfect day.
020	PRO	004	019	The way of the wicked is as thick darkness; They know not at what they stumble.
020	PRO	004	020	My son, attend to my words; Incline thine ear to my sayings;
020	PRO	004	021	Let them not depart from thine eyes; Keep them in the midst of thy heart!
020	PRO	004	022	For they are life to those who find them, And health to all their flesh.
020	PRO	004	023	More than any thing which thou watchest, watch thy heart; For from it goeth forth life.
020	PRO	004	024	Put away from thee a deceitful mouth, And remove far from thee perverse lips.
020	PRO	004	025	Let thine eyes look straight forward, And thine eyelids be directed before thee.
020	PRO	004	026	Give heed to the path of thy foot, And let all thy ways be steadfast.
020	PRO	004	027	Turn not to the right hand or to the left; Remove thy foot from evil.
020	PRO	005	001	My son, attend to my wisdom. And bow thine ear to my understanding;
020	PRO	005	002	That thou mayest keep discretion, And that thy lips may preserve knowledge!
020	PRO	005	003	Truly, the lips of a strange woman drop honey, And her mouth is smoother than oil;
020	PRO	005	004	But her end is bitter as wormwood, Sharp as a two-edged sword.
020	PRO	005	005	Her feet go down to death; Her steps lay hold of the under-world.
020	PRO	005	006	That she may not ponder the way of life, Her paths waver when she heedeth it not.
020	PRO	005	007	Hear me now, therefore, O children! And turn not away from the words of my mouth!
020	PRO	005	008	Remove thy way far from her. And come not nigh the door of her house:
020	PRO	005	009	Lest thou give thy bloom to others, And thy years to a cruel one;
020	PRO	005	010	Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth, And thine earnings be in the house of an alien;
020	PRO	005	011	And lest thou mourn in thy latter end. When thy flesh and thy body are consumed,
020	PRO	005	012	And say, “How have I hated instruction! And how hath my heart despised reproof!
020	PRO	005	013	I have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, Nor inclined mine ear to my instructors;
020	PRO	005	014	I have well-nigh fallen into utter misery; In the midst of the congregation and the assembly.”
020	PRO	005	015	Drink water out of thine own cistern. And running water out of thine own well:
020	PRO	005	016	So shall thy fountains overflow in the streets, In the wide streets, as streams of water;
020	PRO	005	017	They shall belong to thee alone, And not to strangers with thee;
020	PRO	005	018	And thy fountain shall be blessed, Yea, thou shalt have joy in the wife of thy youth.
020	PRO	005	019	A lovely hind, a graceful doe, Her breasts shall satisfy thee at all times, And thou shalt be always ravished with her love.
020	PRO	005	020	Why, then, my son, wilt thou be ravished with a wanton, And embrace the bosom of a stranger?
020	PRO	005	021	For the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD, And he weigheth well all his paths.
020	PRO	005	022	His own iniquities shall ensnare the wicked; Yea, he shall be held fast by the cords of his own sins.
020	PRO	005	023	He shall die for want of instruction; Yea, through the greatness of his folly he shall stagger.
020	PRO	006	001	My son, if thou hast become surety for another, If thou hast stricken hands for another,
020	PRO	006	002	If thou hast become ensnared by the words of thy mouth, If thou hast been caught by the words of thy mouth,
020	PRO	006	003	Do this now, my son, and rescue thyself, —Since thou hast fallen into the hands of thy neighbor, —Go, prostrate thyself, and be urgent with thy neighbor!
020	PRO	006	004	Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids;
020	PRO	006	005	Rescue thyself, as a roe from the hand, And as a bird from the hand of the fowler.
020	PRO	006	006	Go to the ant, O sluggard! Consider her ways, and be wise!
020	PRO	006	007	She hath no governor, Nor overseer, nor ruler;
020	PRO	006	008	Yet she prepareth in the summer her food, She gathereth in the harvest her meat.
020	PRO	006	009	How long wilt thou lie in bed, O sluggard? When wilt thou arise from thy sleep?
020	PRO	006	010	“A little sleep, —a little slumber, —A little folding of the hands to rest:”
020	PRO	006	011	So shall thy poverty come upon thee like a robber, Yea, thy want, as an armed man!
020	PRO	006	012	A worthless wretch is the unrighteous man, Who walketh with a deceitful mouth;
020	PRO	006	013	Who winketh with his eyes, Speaketh with his feet, And teacheth with his fingers.
020	PRO	006	014	Fraud is in his heart; He deviseth mischief continually; He scattereth contentions.
020	PRO	006	015	Therefore shall calamity come upon him suddenly; In a moment shall he be destroyed, and that without remedy;
020	PRO	006	016	These six things doth the LORD hate; Yea, seven are an abomination to him:
020	PRO	006	017	Lofty eyes, a false tongue, And hands which shed innocent blood;
020	PRO	006	018	A heart that contriveth wicked devices; Feet that are swift in running to mischief,
020	PRO	006	019	A false witness, that uttereth lies, And him that soweth discord among brethren.
020	PRO	006	020	Keep, O my son! the commandment of thy father, And forsake not the precepts of thy mother!
020	PRO	006	021	Bind them continually to thy heart, Tie them around thy neck!
020	PRO	006	022	When thou goest forth, they shall guide thee; When thou sleepest, they shall watch over thee; And, when thou awakest, they shall talk with thee.
020	PRO	006	023	For the commandment is a lamp, and instruction a light; Yea, the rebukes of correction lead to life.
020	PRO	006	024	They shall guard thee from the evil woman, From the smooth tongue of the unchaste woman.
020	PRO	006	025	Desire not her beauty in thy heart, Nor let her catch thee with her eyelids;
020	PRO	006	026	For by a harlot a man is brought to a morsel of bread, And the adulteress layeth snares for the precious life.
020	PRO	006	027	Can a man take fire into his bosom, And his clothes not be burned?
020	PRO	006	028	Can one walk upon burning coals, And his feet not be scorched?
020	PRO	006	029	So is it with him who goeth in to his neighbor's wife; Whoever toucheth her shall not go unpunished.
020	PRO	006	030	Men do not overlook a thief, Though he steal to satisfy his appetite, when he is hungry;
020	PRO	006	031	If found, he must repay sevenfold, And give up all the substance of his house.
020	PRO	006	032	Whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding; He that doeth it destroyeth himself;
020	PRO	006	033	Blows and dishonor shall he get, And his reproach shall not be wiped away.
020	PRO	006	034	For jealousy is the fury of a man; He will not spare in the day of vengeance;
020	PRO	006	035	And he will not pay regard to any ransom, Nor be content, though thou offer many gifts.
020	PRO	007	001	My son, keep my words, And treasure up my commandments with thee!
020	PRO	007	002	Keep my commandments and live! Yea, my teaching, as the apple of thine eye!
020	PRO	007	003	Bind them upon thy fingers, Write them upon the tablet of thy heart!
020	PRO	007	004	Say unto wisdom, “Thou art my sister!” And call understanding thy near acquaintance;
020	PRO	007	005	That they may keep thee from the wife of another, From the stranger, that useth smooth words.
020	PRO	007	006	For through the window of my house, Through the lattice I was looking forth,
020	PRO	007	007	And I saw among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, A young man void of understanding.
020	PRO	007	008	He was passing through the street near her corner, And was going the way to her house,
020	PRO	007	009	At twilight, in the evening, At midnight, yea, in the thick darkness.
020	PRO	007	010	And, behold, a woman met him, In the attire of a harlot, and subtle of heart, —
020	PRO	007	011	One noisy and unruly, Whose feet abide not in her house;
020	PRO	007	012	Who is now in the streets, now in the broad places, And lurketh near every corner.
020	PRO	007	013	She caught hold of him and kissed him, And with a shameless face said to him,
020	PRO	007	014	“Thank-offerings have been upon me, And this day have I performed my vows;
020	PRO	007	015	Therefore came I forth to meet thee, —Diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee!
020	PRO	007	016	I have spread my bed with coverlets, With tapestry of the thread of Egypt.
020	PRO	007	017	I have sprinkled my bed With myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
020	PRO	007	018	Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning; Let us solace ourselves with caresses.
020	PRO	007	019	For the good-man is not at home; He is gone a long journey;
020	PRO	007	020	He hath taken a purse of money with him; At the day of the full moon he will return.”
020	PRO	007	021	By her much fair speech she seduced him; By the smoothness of her lips she drew him away.
020	PRO	007	022	He goeth after her straightway, As an ox goeth to the slaughter, Or as one in fetters to the chastisement of the fool,
020	PRO	007	023	Till an arrow strike through his liver; —As a bird hasteneth into the snare, And knoweth not that it is laid for its life.
020	PRO	007	024	Now, therefore, ye children, hearken to me, And attend to the words of my mouth!
020	PRO	007	025	Let not thy heart turn aside to her ways; Go not astray in her paths!
020	PRO	007	026	For many are the wounded which she hath cast down; Yea, countless is the number of those slain by her.
020	PRO	007	027	Her house is the way to the under-world, Leading down to the chambers of death.
020	PRO	008	001	Doth not wisdom cry aloud, And understanding put forth her voice?
020	PRO	008	002	Upon the top of the high places, By the wayside, In the cross-ways, She taketh her station.
020	PRO	008	003	By the side of the gates, In the entrance of the city, In the approaches to the doors, she crieth aloud.
020	PRO	008	004	“To you, O men! do I call, And my voice is to the sons of men!
020	PRO	008	005	O ye simple ones! learn wisdom, And ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart!
020	PRO	008	006	Hear, for I speak excellent things, And my lips utter that which is right.
020	PRO	008	007	For my mouth speaketh truth, And wickedness is an abomination to my lips.
020	PRO	008	008	All the words of my mouth are in uprightness; There is nothing crooked or deceitful in them;

020	PRO	008	010	Receive my instruction, and not silver. And knowledge rather than choice gold!

020	PRO	008	012	“I, wisdom, dwell with prudence, And find out the knowledge of sagacious counsels.
020	PRO	008	013	The fear of the LORD is to hate evil; Pride, and arrogance, and the evil way, And the deceitful mouth, do I hate.
020	PRO	008	014	Counsel is mine, and sound reason; I am understanding; I have strength.

# BOOK	021	ECC	Ecclesiastes	Ecclesiastes
021	ECC	001	001	The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.
021	ECC	001	002	Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities, all is vanity.
021	ECC	001	003	What profit hath a man by all his labor with which he wearieth himself under the sun?
021	ECC	001	004	One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh; while the earth abideth for ever.
021	ECC	001	005	The sun riseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteneth to the place whence it arose.
021	ECC	001	006	The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about to the north; round and round goeth the wind, and returneth to its circuits.
021	ECC	001	007	All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not full; to the place whence the rivers come, thither they return.
021	ECC	001	008	All words become weary; man cannot express it; the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.
021	ECC	001	009	The thing that hath been is that which shall be, and that which hath been done is that which shall be done; and there is no new thing under the sun.
021	ECC	001	010	Is there any thing of which one may say, “Behold, this is new”? It was long ago, in the times which were before us.
021	ECC	001	011	There is no remembrance of former things, and of things that are to come there shall be no remembrance to those who live afterwards.
021	ECC	001	012	I, the Preacher, was king over Israel at Jerusalem.
021	ECC	001	013	And I gave my mind to seek and to search out with wisdom concerning all things which are done under heaven; an evil business, which God hath given to the sons of men, in which to employ themselves.
021	ECC	001	014	I saw all the things which are done under the sun; and, behold, it was all vanity, and striving after wind.
021	ECC	001	015	That which is crooked cannot be made straight, and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.
021	ECC	001	016	I communed with my heart, saying, “Behold, I have gained more and greater wisdom than all who have been before me at Jerusalem; yea, my mind hath seen much wisdom and knowledge.”
021	ECC	001	017	And I gave my mind to know wisdom, and to know senselessness and folly; I perceived that this also is striving after wind.
021	ECC	001	018	For in much wisdom is much vexation, and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.
021	ECC	002	001	I said in my heart, “Come, now, I will try thee with mirth; therefore enjoy pleasure!” But, lo! this also was vanity.
021	ECC	002	002	I said of laughter, “It is mad;” and of mirth, “What availeth it?”
021	ECC	002	003	I thought in my heart to strengthen my body with wine, and, while my heart cleaved to wisdom, to lay hold on folly, till I should see what was good for the sons of men, which they should do under heaven all the days of their life.
021	ECC	002	004	I made me great works. I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards.
021	ECC	002	005	I made me gardens and parks, and planted in them fruit-trees of every kind.
021	ECC	002	006	I made me pools of water, with which to water the grove shooting up trees.
021	ECC	002	007	I got me men-servants and maid-servants, and had servants born in my house. I had also great possessions of herds and flocks, more than all who were in Jerusalem before me.
021	ECC	002	008	I heaped me up also silver and gold, and the wealth of kings and of provinces. I got me men-singers and women-singers, and the delight of the sons of men, a chosen woman and chosen women.
021	ECC	002	009	So I became greater than all that were before me in Jerusalem. My wisdom also remained with me.
021	ECC	002	010	And whatever mine eyes desired I kept not from them; I withheld not my heart from any joy. For my heart rejoiced by means of all my labor, and this was my portion from all my labor.
021	ECC	002	011	Then I looked upon all the works which my hands had wrought, and upon all the labor which I had toiled in performing; and, behold, it was all vanity, and striving after wind, and there was no profit under the sun.
021	ECC	002	012	Then I turned myself to behold wisdom and senselessness and folly. For what can the man do that cometh after the king? even that which hath been already done.
021	ECC	002	013	I saw, indeed, that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness.
021	ECC	002	014	The wise man's eyes are in his head, but the fool walketh in darkness; yet I perceived also that one event happeneth to them all.
021	ECC	002	015	Then I said in my heart, “As it happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth to me. Why, then, became I wiser than others?” Then I said in my heart, “This also is vanity.”
021	ECC	002	016	For there is no remembrance of the wise man more than of the fool for ever; for in the days to come shall all have long been forgotten; and, alas! the wise man dieth, as well as the fool.
021	ECC	002	017	Therefore I hated life, because what is done under the sun appeared evil to me. For all is vanity, and striving after wind.
021	ECC	002	018	Yea, I hated all my labor which I had performed under the sun, because I must leave it to the man that shall be after me.
021	ECC	002	019	And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool? Yet shall he be lord of all the labor with which I have wearied myself, and in which I have shown myself wise under the sun. This also is vanity.
021	ECC	002	020	Therefore I turned to give up my heart to despair in regard to all the labor with which I had wearied myself under the sun.
021	ECC	002	021	For there is a man whose labor has been with wisdom and knowledge and skill; yet to a man who hath not labored for it must he leave it as his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil.
021	ECC	002	022	For what hath man of all his labor, and the striving of his spirit, with which he wearieth himself under the sun?
021	ECC	002	023	For all his days are grief, and his occupation trouble; even in the night his heart taketh no rest. This also is vanity.
021	ECC	002	024	There is nothing better for a man than to eat and drink, and let his soul enjoy good in his labor. But this, as I have seen, cometh from the hand of God.
021	ECC	002	025	For who can eat, or hasten thereunto more than I?
021	ECC	002	026	For to a man who is good in his sight God giveth wisdom and knowledge and joy; but to the sinner he giveth the wearisome business of gathering and heaping up, to give it to him who is good before God. This also is vanity, and striving after wind.
021	ECC	003	001	For every thing there is a fixed period, and an appointed time to every thing under heaven: —
021	ECC	003	002	A time to be born, and a time to die. A time to plant, and a time to pluck up what is planted.
021	ECC	003	003	A time to kill, and a time to heal. A time to breaking down, and a time to build up.
021	ECC	003	004	A time to weep, and a time to laugh. A time to mourn, and a time to dance.
021	ECC	003	005	A time to cast stones asunder, and a time to gather stones together. A time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing.
021	ECC	003	006	A time to seek, and a time to lose. A time to keep, and a time to cast away.
021	ECC	003	007	A time to rend, and a time to sew. A time to keep silence, and a time to speak.
021	ECC	003	008	A time to love, and a time to hate. A time of war, and a time of peace.—
021	ECC	003	009	What profit hath he who laboreth from that with which he wearieth himself?
021	ECC	003	010	I have seen the business which God hath given to the sons of men to exercise themselves therewith.
021	ECC	003	011	God maketh every thing good in its time; but he hath put the world into the heart of man, so that he understandeth not the work which God doeth, from the beginning to the end.
021	ECC	003	012	I know that there is nothing better for a man than that he should rejoice and enjoy good his life long.
021	ECC	003	013	But when a man eateth and drinketh, and enjoyeth good through all his labor, this is the gift of God.
021	ECC	003	014	I know that whatever God doeth, that shall be for ever. Nothing can be added to it, and nothing taken from it; and God doeth it that men may fear before him.
021	ECC	003	015	That which is, was long ago; and that which is to be, hath already been; and God recalleth that which is past.
021	ECC	003	016	Moreover, I saw under the sun that in the place of justice there was iniquity; and in the place of righteousness, iniquity.
021	ECC	003	017	Then said I in my heart, “God will judge the righteous and the wicked.” For there shall be a time for every matter and for every work.
021	ECC	003	018	I said in my heart concerning the sons of men, that God will prove them, in order that they may see that they are like the beasts.
021	ECC	003	019	For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts: one lot befalleth both. As the one dieth, so dieth the other. Yea, there is one spirit in them, and a man hath no pre-eminence above a beast; for all is vanity.
021	ECC	003	020	All go to one place; all are from the dust, and all turn to dust again.
021	ECC	003	021	Who knoweth the spirit of man, whether it goeth upward, and the spirit of a beast, whether it goeth downward to the earth?
021	ECC	003	022	And so I saw that there is nothing better than that a man should rejoice in his labors; for that is his portion. For who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?
021	ECC	004	001	Then I turned and saw all the oppressions which take place under the sun; and, behold, there were the tears of the oppressed, and they had no comforter; and from the hand of their oppressors there was violence, and they had no comforter.
021	ECC	004	002	Therefore I praised the dead, who have been long ago dead, more than the living, who are yet alive.
021	ECC	004	003	Yea, better than both of them is he who hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work which is done under the sun.
021	ECC	004	004	And I saw all labor, and all success in work, that for this a man is envied by his neighbor. This also is vanity, and striving after wind.
021	ECC	004	005	The fool foldeth his hands together and eateth his own flesh.
021	ECC	004	006	Better is a hand full of quietness, than both hands full of weariness and striving after wind.
021	ECC	004	007	Then I turned and saw other vanity under the sun.
021	ECC	004	008	There is one who is alone, and no one with him; yea, he hath neither son nor brother; yet is there no end to all his labor, and his eye is not satisfied with riches. “For whom, then [[saith he]], do I labor and deprive myself of good?” This also is vanity; yea, it is an evil thing!
021	ECC	004	009	Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor.
021	ECC	004	010	For if they fall, the one will lift his fellow up; but woe to him who is alone when he falleth, and hath not another to help him up!
021	ECC	004	011	Again, if two lie together, then they have heat; but how can one be warm alone?
021	ECC	004	012	And if an enemy prevail against one, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.
021	ECC	004	013	Better is a child poor but wise, than a king old and foolish, who will no more be admonished.
021	ECC	004	014	For out of prison cometh forth such a one to reign; for in his own kingdom he was born a poor man.
021	ECC	004	015	I saw that all the living, who walk under the sun, were with the child who stood up in his stead.
021	ECC	004	016	There was no end to all the people before whom he went forth; yet they that come afterwards shall not rejoice in him. This also is vanity, and striving after wind.
021	ECC	005	001	Look well to thy feet, when thou goest to the house of God, and draw nigh to hear, rather than to offer sacrifice as fools. For they consider not that they do evil.
021	ECC	005	002	Be not hasty with thy mouth, and let not thy heart be swift to utter any thing before God. For God is in heaven, and thou upon earth. Therefore let thy words be few.
021	ECC	005	003	For a dream cometh with much bustle, and a fool's voice with a multitude of words.
021	ECC	005	004	When thou vowest a vow to God, delay not to pay it; for he hath no pleasure in fools. Pay that which thou hast vowed.
021	ECC	005	005	Better is it that thou shouldst not vow than that thou shouldst vow and not pay.
021	ECC	005	006	Suffer not thy mouth to bring punishment on thy flesh, and say not before the angel, “It was a mistake.” Wherefore should God be angry on account of thy voice, and destroy the work of thy hands?
021	ECC	005	007	For in a multitude of dreams is a multitude of vanities; so also in a multitude of words; but fear thou God!
021	ECC	005	008	If thou seest oppression of the poor, and justice and equity perverted in a province, be not alarmed at the matter. For over the high there is a higher, who watcheth, and there is one higher than they all.
021	ECC	005	009	An advantage to a land in all respects is a king over cultivated ground.
021	ECC	005	010	He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; and he that loveth riches shall have no profit from them. This also is vanity.
021	ECC	005	011	When goods increase, they are increased that eat them; and what advantage hath the owner thereof, save the beholding of them with his eyes?
021	ECC	005	012	Sweet is the sleep of a laboring man, whether he have eaten little or much; but the repletion of the rich will not suffer him to sleep.
021	ECC	005	013	There is a sore evil which I have seen under the sun, — riches kept by the owner thereof to his hurt.
021	ECC	005	014	For those riches perish by some calamity, and, if he have a son, there is nothing in his hand.
021	ECC	005	015	As he came forth from his mother's womb naked, so shall he go away again, as he came, and shall take away nothing of his labor which he may carry in his hand.
021	ECC	005	016	This is also a sore evil, that, in all points as he came, so shall he go. And what profit is there to him who toileth for wind?
021	ECC	005	017	Also all his days he ate in darkness, and had much grief and anxiety and vexation.
021	ECC	005	018	Behold, what I have seen is, that it is good and proper for one to eat and drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labor which he taketh under the sun all the days of his life, which God giveth him; for it is his portion.
021	ECC	005	019	To whatever man also God hath given riches and wealth, and hath given him to enjoy them, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his labor; this is the gift of God.
021	ECC	005	020	For he will not much remember the days of his life; for God answereth him with the joy of his heart.
021	ECC	006	001	There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it lieth heavy upon men;
021	ECC	006	002	a man to whom God hath given riches, wealth, and honor, and nothing is wanting to him of all which he desireth, yet God giveth him not to taste thereof; but a stranger enjoyeth it. This is vanity, yea, a grievous evil.
021	ECC	006	003	Though a man have a hundred children, and live many years, and though the days of his years be many, if his soul be not satisfied with good, and he have no burial, I say that an untimely birth is better than he.
021	ECC	006	004	This, indeed, cometh in nothingness, and goeth down into darkness, and its name is covered with darkness;
021	ECC	006	005	it hath not seen the sun, nor known it; yet hath it rest rather than the other.
021	ECC	006	006	Yea, though he live a thousand years twice told, and see no good, — do not all go to one place?
021	ECC	006	007	All the labor of man is for his mouth, and yet his desires are not satisfied.
021	ECC	006	008	For what advantage hath the wise man over the fool? What advantage hath the poor, who knoweth how to walk before the living?
021	ECC	006	009	Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire. This also is vanity, and striving after wind.
021	ECC	006	010	That which is was long ago called by name; and it was known that he is a man, and that he cannot contend with Him who is mightier than he.
021	ECC	006	011	Seeing there are many things which increase vanity, what advantage hath man [[from them]]?
021	ECC	006	012	For who knoweth what is good for man in life, in all the days of his vain life, which he spendeth as a shadow? For who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun?
021	ECC	007	001	A good name is better than precious perfume, and the day of one's death than the day of his birth.
021	ECC	007	002	It is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting; for that is the end of all men; and the living will lay it to heart.
021	ECC	007	003	Sorrow is better than laughter; for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better.
021	ECC	007	004	The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.
021	ECC	007	005	It is better for a man to hear the rebuke of the wise than to hear the song of fools.
021	ECC	007	006	For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of a fool. This also is vanity.
021	ECC	007	007	Surely the gain of oppression maketh a wise man foolish, and a gift corrupteth the understanding.
021	ECC	007	008	Better is the end of a thing than its beginning. Better is the patient in spirit than the proud in spirit.
021	ECC	007	009	Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry; for anger resteth in the bosom of fools.
021	ECC	007	010	Say not, “What is the cause that the former days were better than these?” For thou dost not inquire wisely concerning this.
021	ECC	007	011	Wisdom is as good as an estate? yea, it hath an advantage over it for them that see the sun.
021	ECC	007	012	For wisdom is a defence, and money is a defence. But knowledge hath the advantage. For wisdom giveth life to them that have it.
021	ECC	007	013	Consider the work of God! Who can make straight that which he hath made crooked?
021	ECC	007	014	In the day of prosperity be joyful; but look for a day of adversity! for this also, as well as the other, hath God appointed, to the end that a man should not find out any thing which shall be after him.
021	ECC	007	015	All this have I seen in my days of vanity. There are righteous men who perish in their righteousness, and there are wicked men who live long in their wickedness.
021	ECC	007	016	Be not righteous overmuch; neither make thyself over-wise! Why shouldest thou destroy thyself?
021	ECC	007	017	Be not overmuch wicked; neither be thou a fool! Why shouldst thou die before thy time?
021	ECC	007	018	It is good that thou shouldst take hold of this; yea, also, from that withdraw not thy hand. For he that feareth God shall escape all those things.
021	ECC	007	019	Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty men who are in the city.
021	ECC	007	020	Truly there is not a righteous man upon the earth who doeth good and sinneth not.
021	ECC	007	021	Give no heed to all the words which are spoken, lest thou hear thy servant curse thee!
021	ECC	007	022	For many times thine own heart knoweth also that even thou thyself hast cursed others.
021	ECC	007	023	All this have I tried by wisdom. I said, “I will be wise;” but it was far from me.
021	ECC	007	024	That which is far off and exceeding deep, who can find it out?
021	ECC	007	025	I applied my mind earnestly to know, and to search, and to seek out wisdom and intelligence, and to know wickedness and folly, yea, foolishness and madness.
021	ECC	007	026	And I found more bitter than death the woman whose heart is snares and nets, and her hands bands. He that pleaseth God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be caught by her.
021	ECC	007	027	Behold, this have I found, saith the Preacher, putting one thing to another to find knowledge.
021	ECC	007	028	That which my soul hath hitherto sought, and I have not found, is this: a man among a thousand I have found, but a woman among a thousand have I not found.
021	ECC	007	029	Lo, this only have I found, that God made man upright, but they have sought out many devices.
021	ECC	008	001	Who is like the wise man, and who knoweth the explanation of a thing? A man's wisdom brighteneth his countenance, and the harshness of his face is changed.
021	ECC	008	002	I counsel thee to keep the king's commandment, and that on account of the oath of God.
021	ECC	008	003	Be not in haste to depart from his presence; persist not in an evil thing; for whatever pleaseth him, that he doeth.
021	ECC	008	004	For the word of the king is powerful; and who can say to him, “What doest thou?”
021	ECC	008	005	He that keepeth the commandment shall experience no evil; and the heart of the wise man hath regard to time and judgment.
021	ECC	008	006	For to every thing there is a time and judgment. For the misery of man is great upon him.
021	ECC	008	007	For no one knoweth what shall be; for who can tell him how it shall be?
021	ECC	008	008	No man hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit, and no man hath power over the day of death; and there is no discharge in that war; and wickedness shall not deliver those that are guilty of it.
021	ECC	008	009	All this have I seen, and I have given heed to all things that are done under the sun. There is a time when man ruleth over man to his hurt.
021	ECC	008	010	And so I saw the wicked buried, while the righteous came and went from the holy place, and were forgotten in the city. This also is vanity.
021	ECC	008	011	Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore doth the heart of the sons of men become bold within them to do evil.
021	ECC	008	012	But though a sinner do evil a hundred times, and have his days prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, that fear before him.
021	ECC	008	013	But it shall not be well with the wicked: he shall be like a shadow, and shall not prolong his days, because he feareth not before God.
021	ECC	008	014	There is a vanity which taketh place upon the earth, that there are righteous men to whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked, and that there are wicked men to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous. I said, “This also is vanity!”
021	ECC	008	015	Then I commended joy; because nothing is good for a man under the sun, except to eat and to drink and to be joyful; for it is this that abideth with him for his labor during the days of his life which God giveth him under the sun.
021	ECC	008	016	When I applied my mind to know wisdom, and to see the business which is done upon the earth, —that one seeth no sleep with his eyes by day or by night, —
021	ECC	008	017	then I saw the whole work of God, that a man cannot comprehend that which is done under the sun; how much soever he labor to search it out, yet shall he not comprehend it; yea, though a wise man resolve to know it, yet shall he not be able to comprehend it.
021	ECC	009	001	For I gave my mind to all this, even to search out all this, that the righteous and the wise and their works are in the hand of God, and yet neither his love nor hatred doth any man know. All is before them.
021	ECC	009	002	All [[cometh to them]] as to all. There is one event to the righteous and to the wicked; to the good, to the clean, and to the unclean; to him that sacrificeth, and to him that sacrificeth not; as is the good, so is the sinner; he that sweareth, as he that feareth an oath.
021	ECC	009	003	This is an evil among all things which take place under the sun, that there is one event to all; therefore also the heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live, and afterward they go down to the dead.
021	ECC	009	004	For who is there that is excepted? With all the living there is hope; for a living dog is better than a dead lion.
021	ECC	009	005	For the living know that they shall die; but the dead know not any thing, and there is no more to them any advantage, for their memory is forgotten.
021	ECC	009	006	Their love also, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they a portion any more for ever in any thing which taketh place under the sun.
021	ECC	009	007	Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a cheerful heart; for long since hath God been pleased with thy works.
021	ECC	009	008	Let thy garments be always white, and let not fragrant oil be wanting upon thy head.
021	ECC	009	009	Enjoy life with the wife whom thou lovest, all the days of thy vain life which he hath given thee under the sun, all thy vain days. For this is thy portion in life, and in thy labor with which thou weariest thyself under the sun.
021	ECC	009	010	Whatever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might! For there is no work nor device nor knowledge nor wisdom in the under-world, whither thou goest.
021	ECC	009	011	I turned and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, nor yet bread to the wise, nor riches to men of understanding, nor favor to men of knowledge; but time and chance happen to them all.
021	ECC	009	012	For man knoweth not his time. As fishes that are taken in a destructive net, and as birds that are caught in a snare, so are the sons of men snared in a time of distress, when it falleth suddenly upon them.
021	ECC	009	013	This also have I seen; even wisdom under the sun, and it seemed great to me.
021	ECC	009	014	There was a little city, and few men within it; and a great king came against it, and besieged it, and built great bulwarks against it.
021	ECC	009	015	Now there was found within it a wise poor man; and he, by his wisdom, delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man.
021	ECC	009	016	Then said I, “Wisdom is better than strength;” and yet the poor man's wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard.
021	ECC	009	017	The quiet words of the wise are sooner heard than the shouting of a foolish ruler.
021	ECC	009	018	Wisdom is better than weapons of war. But one offender destroyeth much good.
021	ECC	010	001	Dead flies make the oil of the perfumer loathsome and corrupt; thus doth a little folly weigh down wisdom and honor.
021	ECC	010	002	A wise man's mind is at his right hand; but a fool's mind is at his left.
021	ECC	010	003	Yea, even when the fool walketh in the way, his understanding faileth him, and he saith to every one that he is a fool.
021	ECC	010	004	If the anger of a ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place! for gentleness pacifieth great offences.
021	ECC	010	005	There is an evil which I have seen under the sun; an error which proceedeth from a ruler.
021	ECC	010	006	Folly is set in many high stations, and the noble sit in a low place.
021	ECC	010	007	I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants on foot.
021	ECC	010	008	He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh down a wall, a serpent shall bite him.
021	ECC	010	009	Whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith, and he that cleaveth wood shall be endangered thereby.
021	ECC	010	010	If the iron be blunt, and one do not whet the edge, then must he put forth more strength; but an advantage for giving success hath wisdom.
021	ECC	010	011	If a serpent bite before he is charmed, then there is no advantage to the charmer.
021	ECC	010	012	The words of a wise man's mouth are gracious; but the lips of a fool are his destruction.
021	ECC	010	013	The beginning of the words of his mouth is folly, and the end of his talk is mischievous madness.
021	ECC	010	014	A fool also multiplieth words, though no man knoweth what shall be; and who can tell him what shall be after him?
021	ECC	010	015	The labor of the foolish man wearieth him, because he knoweth not how to go to the city.
021	ECC	010	016	Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child, and thy princes feast in the morning!
021	ECC	010	017	Happy thou, O land, when thy king is a noble, and thy princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness!
021	ECC	010	018	By much slothfulness the building decayeth; and by the slackness of the hands the house leaketh.
021	ECC	010	019	A feast is made for laughter, and wine makes merry; but money answereth all things.
021	ECC	010	020	Curse not the king; no, not in thy thought; and curse not the rich in thy bed-chamber! for a bird of the air shall carry the voice; and that which hath wings shall tell the matter.
021	ECC	011	001	Cast thy bread upon the waters; for after many days thou shalt find it.
021	ECC	011	002	Give a portion to seven, yea, to eight; for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth.
021	ECC	011	003	When the clouds are full of rain, they empty upon the earth; and when a tree falleth to the south or the north, in the place where the tree falleth, there it shall be.
021	ECC	011	004	He that watcheth the wind will not sow, and he that gazeth upon the clouds will not reap.
021	ECC	011	005	As thou knowest not the way of the wind, nor how the bones are formed in the womb of her that is with child, so thou canst not know the work of God, who doeth all things.
021	ECC	011	006	In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thy hand! For thou knowest not whether this shall prosper, or that, or whether both of them shall be alike good.
021	ECC	011	007	Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun.
021	ECC	011	008	Yea, though a man live many years, let him rejoice in them all, and let him think of the days of darkness; for they shall be many. All that cometh is vanity.
021	ECC	011	009	Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth, and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thy heart, and in the sight of thine eyes! but know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into judgment.
021	ECC	011	010	Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from thy body! for childhood and youth are vanity.
021	ECC	012	001	Remember, also, thy Creator in the days of thy youth, before the evil days come, and the years draw nigh, of which thou shalt say, “I have no pleasure in them;”
021	ECC	012	002	before the sun, and the light, and the moon, and the stars become dark, and the clouds return after the rain;
021	ECC	012	003	at the time when the keepers of the house tremble, and the strong men bow themselves, and the grinders cease because they are few, and those that look out of the windows are darkened;
021	ECC	012	004	when the doors are shut in the streets, while the sound of the mill is low; when they rise up at the voice of the bird, and all the daughters of music are brought low;
021	ECC	012	005	when also they are afraid of that which is high, and terrors are in the way, and the almond is despised, and the locust is a burden, and the caper-berry is powerless; since man goeth to his eternal home, and the mourners go about the streets; —
021	ECC	012	006	before the silver cord be snapped asunder, and the golden bowl be crushed, or the bucket broken at the fountain, or the wheel shattered at the well,
021	ECC	012	007	and the dust return to the earth as it was, and the spirit return to God who gave it.
021	ECC	012	008	Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher; all is vanity!
021	ECC	012	009	Moreover, because the Preacher was wise, he still taught the people knowledge; yea, he considered, and sought out, and set in order, many proverbs.
021	ECC	012	010	The Preacher sought to find out acceptable words, and to write correctly words of truth.
021	ECC	012	011	The words of the wise are as goads; yea, as nails driven in are the words of members of assemblies, given by one shepherd.
021	ECC	012	012	And, moreover, by these, my son, be warned! To the multiplying of books there is no end, and much study wearieth the flesh.
021	ECC	012	013	Let us hear the end of the whole discourse! Fear God and keep his commandments! For this is the duty of every man.
021	ECC	012	014	For God will bring every work into the judgment which there is upon every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.

022	SOL	001	001	The Song of Songs, which is by Solomon.
022	SOL	001	002	[[M.]] O that he would kiss me with one of the kisses of his mouth! For thy love is better than wine.
022	SOL	001	003	Because of the savor of thy precious perfumes, (Thy name is like fragrant oil poured forth, ) Therefore do the virgins love thee.
022	SOL	001	004	Draw me after thee; let us run! The king hath led me to his chambers! We will be glad and rejoice in thee; We will praise thy love more than wine. Justly do they love thee!
022	SOL	001	005	I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, As the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.
022	SOL	001	006	Gaze not upon me because I am black, Because the sun hath looked upon me! My mother's sons were angry with me; They made me keeper of the vineyards; My vineyard, my own, have I not kept.
022	SOL	001	007	Tell me, thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest thy flock, Where thou leadest it to rest at noon; For why should I be like a veiled one by the flocks of thy companions?
022	SOL	001	008	[[Lad.]] If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, Trace thou thy way by the tracks of the flock, And feed thy kids beside the shepherds' tents!
022	SOL	001	009	[[Lov.]] To the horses in the chariots of Pharaoh Do I compare thee, my love!
022	SOL	001	010	Comely are thy cheeks with rows of jewels, Thy neck with strings of pearls.
022	SOL	001	011	Golden chains will we make for thee, With studs of silver.
022	SOL	001	012	[[M.]] While the king reclineth at his table, My spikenard sendeth forth its fragrance.
022	SOL	001	013	A bunch of myrrh is my beloved to me; He shall abide between my breasts.
022	SOL	001	014	My beloved is to me a cluster of henna-flowers From the gardens of Engedi.
022	SOL	001	015	[[Lov.]] Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair! Thine eyes are doves.
022	SOL	001	016	[[M.]] Behold, thou art fair, my beloved, yea, lovely; And green is our bed.
022	SOL	001	017	The cedars are the beams of our house, And its roof the cypresses.
022	SOL	002	001	I am a rose of Sharon, A lily of the valleys.
022	SOL	002	002	[[Lov.]] As the lily among thorns, So is my love among the daughters.
022	SOL	002	003	[[M.]] As the apple-tree among the trees of the forest, So is my beloved among the sons. In his shadow I love to sit down, And his fruit is sweet to my taste.
022	SOL	002	004	He hath brought me to his banqueting-house, And his banner over me is love. Strengthen me with raisins,
022	SOL	002	005	Refresh me with apples! For I am sick with love.
022	SOL	002	006	His left hand is under my head, And his right hand embraceth me!
022	SOL	002	007	[[Lov.]] I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, By the gazelles, and by the hinds of the field, That ye stir not up, nor awake my love, till she please!
022	SOL	002	008	[[M.]] The voice of my beloved! Behold, he cometh, Leaping upon the mountains, Bounding upon the hills.
022	SOL	002	009	Like a gazelle is my beloved, Or a young hind. Behold, he standeth behind our wall; He is looking through the windows; He glanceth through the lattice.
022	SOL	002	010	My beloved speaketh, and saith to me, “Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away!
022	SOL	002	011	For, lo, the winter is past, The rain is over and gone;
022	SOL	002	012	The flowers appear on the earth; The time of the singing of birds is come, And the voice of the turtle is heard in our land;
022	SOL	002	013	The fig-tree is spicing its green fruit; The vines in blossom give forth fragrance. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away!
022	SOL	002	014	O my dove, that art in the recesses of the rock, In the hiding-places of the steep craggy mountain, Let me see thy face, Let me hear thy voice! For sweet is thy voice, And thy face lovely.”
022	SOL	002	015	Take ye for us the foxes, The little foxes that spoil the vines; For our vines are now in blossom.
022	SOL	002	016	My beloved is mine, and I am his; He feedeth among the lilies.
022	SOL	002	017	When the day breathes, and the shadows flee away, Come again, my beloved, like a gazelle, or a young hind, Upon the craggy mountains.
022	SOL	003	001	[[M.]] Upon my bed, in the night, I sought him whom my soul loveth; I sought him, but found him not.
022	SOL	003	002	I will arise now [[said I]], and go about the city; In the streets and the broad ways will I seek him whom my soul loveth; I sought him, but found him not.
022	SOL	003	003	The watchmen who go about the city found me; “Have you seen [[said I]] him whom my soul loveth?”
022	SOL	003	004	I had but just passed them, When I found him whom my soul loveth; I held him, and would not let him go, Till I had brought him into my mother's house, Into the apartment of her that bore me.
022	SOL	003	005	[[Lov.]] I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem! By the gazelles, and by the hinds of the field, That ye stir not up, nor awake my love, till she please.
022	SOL	003	006	Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness, Like pillars of smoke, Perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, With all the powders of the merchant?
022	SOL	003	007	Behold, the carriage of Solomon! Threescore valiant men are around it, Of the valiant men of Israel.
022	SOL	003	008	They all wear swords, Being skilled in war. Every one hath his sword girt upon his thigh, On account of danger in the night.
022	SOL	003	009	King Solomon made for himself a carriage Of the wood of Lebanon.
022	SOL	003	010	The pillars thereof he made of silver, The railing of gold, The seat of purple, Its interior curiously wrought by a lovely one of the daughters of Jerusalem.
022	SOL	003	011	Go forth, O ye daughters of Zion! And behold King Solomon In the crown with which his mother crowned him, In the day of his espousals, In the day of the gladness of his heart.
022	SOL	004	001	[[Lov.]] Behold, thou art fair, my love! behold, thou art fair! Thine eyes are doves behind thy veil; Thy locks are like a flock of goats Which lie down on mount Gilead;
022	SOL	004	002	Thy teeth are like a flock of shorn sheep, Which come up from the washing-place, Of which every one beareth twins, And none is barren among them;
022	SOL	004	003	Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet, And thy mouth comely; Thy cheeks are like a divided pomegranate behind thy veil;
022	SOL	004	004	Thy neck is like the tower of David, Built for an armory, In which there hang a thousand bucklers, All shields of mighty men;
022	SOL	004	005	Thy two breasts are like two young twin gazelles, That feed among the lilies.
022	SOL	004	006	When the day breathes, and the shadows flee away, I will betake me to the mountain of myrrh And the hill of frankincense.
022	SOL	004	007	Thou art all fair, my love; There is no spot in thee!
022	SOL	004	008	Come with me from Lebanon, my spouse, With me from Lebanon! Look from the top of Amana, From the top of Senir and Hermon, From the dens of the lions, From the mountains of the leopards.
022	SOL	004	009	Thou hast taken captive my heart, my sister, my spouse; Thou hast taken captive my heart with one of thine eyes, With one chain of thy neck.
022	SOL	004	010	How sweet is thy love, my sister, my spouse! How much more precious thy caresses than wine, And the fragrance of thy perfumes than all spices!
022	SOL	004	011	Thy lips, O my spouse! drop the honeycomb; Honey and milk are under thy tongue, And the fragrance of thy garments is as the fragrance of Lebanon.
022	SOL	004	012	A garden inclosed is my sister, my spouse; A spring shut up, a fountain sealed;
022	SOL	004	013	Thy plants are an orchard of pomegranates, with choicest fruits, Henna and spikenard,
022	SOL	004	014	Spikenard and saffron, Sweet cane and cinnamon, With all trees of frankincense; Myrrh and aloes, With all the chief spices;
022	SOL	004	015	A fountain of the gardens, A well of living water, A stream that floweth from Lebanon!
022	SOL	004	016	[[M.]] Awake, O north wind, and come, thou south! Blow upon my garden, That its spices may flow out! May my beloved come to his garden, And eat his pleasant fruits.
022	SOL	005	001	[[Lov.]] I am come to my garden, my sister, my spouse! I gather my myrrh with my balsam, I eat my honeycomb with my honey, I drink my wine with my milk. Eat, O friends! Drink, yea, drink abundantly, my loved companions!
022	SOL	005	002	[[M.]] I slept, but my heart was awake; It was the voice of my beloved, who was knocking: “Open to me, my sister, my love, My dove, my perfect one! For my head is filled with dew, And my locks with the drops of the night.”
022	SOL	005	003	“I have taken off my vest [[said I]]; How shall I put it on? I have washed my feet; How shall I soil them?”
022	SOL	005	004	My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door, And my heart was moved for him.
022	SOL	005	005	I rose up to open to my beloved, And my hands dropped with myrrh, And my fingers with self-flowing myrrh, upon the handles of the bolt.
022	SOL	005	006	I opened to my beloved; But my beloved had withdrawn himself, and was gone. I was not in my senses while he spake with me! I sought him, but could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer.
022	SOL	005	007	The watchmen that go about the city found me; They smote me, they wounded me; The keepers of the walls took away from me my veil.
022	SOL	005	008	I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem! If ye should find my beloved, —What will ye tell him? That I am sick with love.
022	SOL	005	009	[[Lad.]] What is thy beloved more than another beloved, O thou fairest among women! What is thy beloved more than another beloved, That thus thou dost charge us?
022	SOL	005	010	[[M.]] My beloved is white and ruddy, The chief among ten thousand.
022	SOL	005	011	His head is as the most fine gold; His locks waving palm-branches, Black as a raven;
022	SOL	005	012	His eyes are doves by streams of water, Washed with milk, dwelling in fulness;
022	SOL	005	013	His cheeks are like a bed of balsam, Like beds of spices; His lips are lilies Dropping self-flowing myrrh;
022	SOL	005	014	His hands are gold rings set with chrysolite; His body is wrought-work of ivory, overlaid with sapphires;
022	SOL	005	015	His legs are marble pillars, resting on pedestals of fine gold; His aspect is like Lebanon, Majestic like the cedars;
022	SOL	005	016	His mouth is sweetness; His whole being, loveliness. This is my beloved, This my friend, O ye daughters of Jerusalem!
022	SOL	006	001	[[Lad.]] Whither is thy beloved gone, thou fairest among women? Whither hath thy beloved betaken himself? That we may seek him with thee.
022	SOL	006	002	[[M.]] My beloved is gone down to his garden, To the beds of balsam, To feed in the gardens, And to gather lilies.
022	SOL	006	003	I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine; He feedeth among the lilies.
022	SOL	006	004	Beautiful art thou, my love, as Tirzah, Lovely as Jerusalem; But terrible as an army with banners.
022	SOL	006	005	Turn away thine eyes from me! They overpower me! Thy locks are like a flock of goats, Which lie down upon Gilead.
022	SOL	006	006	Thy teeth are like a flock of sheep, Which come up from the washing-place, Of which every one hath twins, And none is barren among them.
022	SOL	006	007	As a divided pomegranate Are thy cheeks behind thy veil.
022	SOL	006	008	Threescore are the queens, and fourscore the concubines, And the maidens without number.
022	SOL	006	009	But my dove, my undefiled, is the one; She is the incomparable one of her mother, The darling of her that bore her. The daughters saw her, and blessed her; The queens and concubines, and they praised her.
022	SOL	006	010	[[Lov.]] Who is this that looketh forth like the morning, Fair as the moon, bright as the sun, And terrible as an army with banners?
022	SOL	006	011	[[M.]] I went down into the garden of nuts, To see the green plants of the valley, To see whether the vine blossomed, And the pomegranates budded.
022	SOL	006	012	Or ever I was aware, My soul had made me like the chariots of the prince's train.
022	SOL	006	013	[[Lad.]] Return, return, O Shulamite! Return, return, that we may look upon thee! [[M.]] Why should ye look upon the Shulamite, As upon a dance of the hosts?
022	SOL	007	001	[[Lov.]] How beautiful are thy feet in sandals, O prince's daughter! The roundings of thy hips are like neck ornaments, The work of the hands of the artificer;
022	SOL	007	002	Thy navel is like a round goblet, that wanteth not the spiced wine; Thy belly like a heap of wheat, inclosed with lilies;
022	SOL	007	003	Thy two breasts are like two young twin gazelles;
022	SOL	007	004	Thy neck is as a tower of ivory; Thine eyes are like the pools at Heshbon, by the gate of Bath-rabbim; Thy nose is as the tower of Lebanon, which looketh toward Damascus;
022	SOL	007	005	Thy head upon thee is like Carmel, And the hair of thy head like purple; The king is captivated by thy locks.
022	SOL	007	006	How fair, how pleasant art thou, love, in delights!
022	SOL	007	007	This thy stature is like the palm-tree, And thy breasts like clusters of dates.
022	SOL	007	008	I will go up, say I to myself, upon the palm-tree; I will take hold of its boughs, And thy breasts shall be as clusters of the vine, And the fragrance of thy nose like apples,
022	SOL	007	009	And thy mouth like the best wine— [[M.]] — that goeth down smoothly for my beloved, Flowing over the lips of them that sleep.
022	SOL	007	010	I am my beloved's, And his desire is toward me.
022	SOL	007	011	Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the country; Let us lodge in the villages!
022	SOL	007	012	Then will we go early to the vineyards, To see whether the vine putteth forth, Whether its blossom openeth, And the pomegranates bud forth; There will I give thee my love!
022	SOL	007	013	The love-apples give forth fragrance; And at our doors are all kinds of precious fruits, new and old: I have kept them for thee, my beloved!
022	SOL	008	001	O that thou wert as my brother, That sucked the breast of my mother! When I found thee abroad, I might kiss thee; And for it no one would deride me.
022	SOL	008	002	I will lead thee, and bring thee into my mother's house, that thou mayst teach me; I will give thee spiced wine to drink, and the juice of my pomegranates.
022	SOL	008	003	His left hand is under my head, And his right hand embraceth me.
022	SOL	008	004	[[Lov.]] I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem! That ye stir not up, nor awake my love, Till she please!
022	SOL	008	005	[[Lad.]] Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness, Leaning upon her beloved? [[M.]] Under the apple-tree I awakened thee; There thy mother brought thee forth; There she that bore thee brought thee forth!
022	SOL	008	006	O set me as a seal upon thy heart, As a seal upon thine arm! For love is strong as death; True love is firm as the grave: Its flames are flames of fire, The fire of Jehovah.
022	SOL	008	007	Many waters cannot quench love, Nor can floods drown it. Would a man give all the wealth of his house for love, It would be utterly contemned.
022	SOL	008	008	[[Br.]] We have a sister who is yet young; She is yet without breasts. What shall we do with our sister, When she shall be spoken for?
022	SOL	008	009	If she be a wall, We will build upon it a silver tower; If she be an open gate, We will inclose her with planks of cedar.
022	SOL	008	010	[[Sis.]] I am a wall, and my breasts like towers; Therefore am I become in his eyes as one that findeth peace.
022	SOL	008	011	Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon; He let out the vineyard to keepers; Every one was to bring a thousand shekels of silver for its fruit.
022	SOL	008	012	My vineyard is before my eyes. Be thine the thousand, O Solomon! And two hundred to the keepers of its fruit!
022	SOL	008	013	[[Lov.]] Thou that dwellest in the gardens! Friends listen to thy voice; Let me hear thee!
022	SOL	008	014	Fly, my beloved! like a gazelle, or a young hind, Upon the mountains of spices.

# BOOK	023	ISA	Isaiah	Isaiah
023	ISA	001	001	The visions of Isaiah, the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.
023	ISA	001	002	Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth! For Jehovah speaketh: “I have nourished and brought up children, And they have rebelled against me.
023	ISA	001	003	The ox knoweth his owner, And the ass his master's crib; But Israel doth not know; My people do not consider.”
023	ISA	001	004	Ah, sinful nation! a people laden with iniquity! A race of evil-doers! degenerate children! They have forsaken Jehovah; they have despised the Holy One of Israel; They have gone backward.
023	ISA	001	005	Where can ye be smitten again, Since ye renew your rebellion? The whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint;
023	ISA	001	006	From the sole of the foot even to the head, there is no soundness in it; It is all bruises, and stripes, and flesh wounds, Neither pressed, nor bound up, nor softened with ointment.
023	ISA	001	007	Your country is desolate; Your cities are burnt with fire; Your ground, strangers devour it before your eyes; It is become desolate, destroyed by an enemy.
023	ISA	001	008	And the daughter of Zion is left as a shed in a vineyard, As a hut in a garden of cucumbers, As a besieged city.
023	ISA	001	009	Had not Jehovah of hosts left us a small remnant, We had soon become as Sodom; We had been like to Gomorrah.
023	ISA	001	010	Hear ye the word of Jehovah, ye princes of Sodom! Give ear to the instruction of our God, ye people of Gomorrah!
023	ISA	001	011	What to me is the multitude of your sacrifices? saith Jehovah; I am satiated with burnt-offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; In the blood of bullocks and of lambs and of goats I have no delight.
023	ISA	001	012	When ye come to appear before me, Who hath required this of you, to tread my courts?
023	ISA	001	013	Bring no more false oblations! Incense is an abomination to me, The new moon also, and the sabbath, and the calling of the assembly; Iniquity and festivals I cannot endure.
023	ISA	001	014	Your new moons and your feasts my soul hateth; They are a burden to me; I am weary of bearing them.
023	ISA	001	015	When ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you; Yea, when ye multiply prayers, I will not hear: Your hands are full of blood!
023	ISA	001	016	Wash you; make you clean; Put away your evil doings from before mine eyes;
023	ISA	001	017	Cease to do evil; Learn to do well; Seek justice; relieve the oppressed; Defend the fatherless; plead for the widow!
023	ISA	001	018	Come, now, and let us argue together, saith Jehovah. Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; Though they be red as crimson, they shall be like wool.
023	ISA	001	019	If ye be willing and obedient, Ye shall consume the good of the land.
023	ISA	001	020	But if ye refuse, and be rebellious, The sword shall consume you; For the mouth of Jehovah hath said it.
023	ISA	001	021	How is the faithful city become a harlot, She that was full of equity! Once justice dwelt in her, but now murderers!
023	ISA	001	022	Thy silver is become dross; Thy wine is adulterated with water.
023	ISA	001	023	Thy princes are faithless, companions of thieves; Every one of them loveth gifts, and seeketh rewards; They render not justice to the fatherless, And the cause of the widow cometh not before them.
023	ISA	001	024	Wherefore, thus saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, the Mighty One of Israel: Ha! I will ease me of mine adversaries, And avenge me of mine enemies.
023	ISA	001	025	And I will again turn my hand toward thee, And wholly purge away thy dross, And take away all thy alloy.
023	ISA	001	026	And I will restore thee judges, as at the first, And counsellors, as at the beginning. Then shalt thou be called the city of righteousness, the faithful city.
023	ISA	001	027	Through justice shall Zion be delivered, And her reformed sons through righteousness.
023	ISA	001	028	But destruction shall fall at once on the rebels and sinners; Yea, they that forsake Jehovah shall be consumed.
023	ISA	001	029	For ye shall be ashamed of the terebinths in which ye delighted; Ye shall blush for the gardens which ye loved;
023	ISA	001	030	And ye shall be as a terebinth-tree whose leaves are withered, And as a garden in which is no water.
023	ISA	001	031	The strong shall become tow, And his work a spark of fire; Both shall burn together, And none shall quench them.
023	ISA	002	001	The word, which was revealed to Isaiah, the son of Amoz, concerning Judah and Jerusalem.
023	ISA	002	002	It shall come to pass in the last days, That the mountain of the house of Jehovah shall be established at the head of the mountains, And exalted above the hills; And all nations shall flow unto it.
023	ISA	002	003	And many kingdoms shall go, and shall say, “Come, let us go to the mountain of Jehovah, To the house of the God of Jacob, That he may teach us his ways, And that we may walk in his paths!” For from Zion shall go forth a law, And the word of Jehovah from Jerusalem.
023	ISA	002	004	He shall be a judge of the nations, And an umpire of many kingdoms; And they shall beat their swords into ploughshares, And their spears into pruning-hooks; Nation shall not lift up the sword against nation, Neither shall they learn war any more.
023	ISA	002	005	O house of Jacob, come ye, And let us walk in the light of Jehovah!
023	ISA	002	006	For thou hast forsaken thy people, the house of Jacob, Because they are full of the East, And are sorcerers, like the Philistines, And strike hands with a foreign race!
023	ISA	002	007	Their land is full of silver and gold, And there is no end to their treasures; Their land is full of horses, And there is no end to their chariots;
023	ISA	002	008	Their land is full of idols; They bow down to the work of their own hands, To that which their own fingers have made.
023	ISA	002	009	Therefore shall the mean man be bowed down, And the great man be brought low; And thou wilt not forgive them!
023	ISA	002	010	Go into the rock, hide yourselves in the dust, From the terror of Jehovah, and the glory of his majesty!
023	ISA	002	011	The proud looks of man shall be humbled, And the loftiness of mortals shall be brought low; Jehovah alone shall be exalted in that day.
023	ISA	002	012	For Jehovah of hosts holdeth a day of judgment Against all that is proud and lofty; Against all that is exalted, and it shall be brought low;
023	ISA	002	013	Against all the cedars of Lebanon, the high and the exalted, And against all the oaks of Bashan;
023	ISA	002	014	Against all the lofty mountains, And against all the high hills;
023	ISA	002	015	Against every lofty tower, And against every high wall;
023	ISA	002	016	Against all the ships of Tarshish, And against all their beautiful flags.
023	ISA	002	017	The pride of man shall be humbled; The loftiness of mortals shall be brought low; Jehovah alone shall be exalted in that day.
023	ISA	002	018	The idols shall wholly pass away;
023	ISA	002	019	And men shall go into clefts of the rocks, and caves of the earth, From the terror of Jehovah, and the glory of his majesty, When he ariseth to make the earth tremble.
023	ISA	002	020	At that time shall men cast away their idols of silver and their idols of gold, Which they have made to worship, To the moles and the bats;
023	ISA	002	021	Fleeing into caves of the rocks, and clefts of the craggy rocks, From the terror of Jehovah, and the glory of his majesty, When he ariseth to make the earth tremble.
023	ISA	002	022	Trust, then, no more in man, Whose breath is in his nostrils! For what account is to be made of him!
023	ISA	003	001	For behold, the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, Taketh away from Jerusalem and from Judah every stay and support; The whole stay of bread, and the whole stay of water;
023	ISA	003	002	The mighty man, and the warrior, The judge, the prophet, the diviner, and the sage,
023	ISA	003	003	The captain of fifty, and the honorable man, The counsellor, the expert in arts, and the skilful in charms.
023	ISA	003	004	And I will make boys their princes, And children shall rule over them.
023	ISA	003	005	And the people shall oppress one another, Man striving against man, and neighbor against neighbor; The boy shall behave himself insolently toward the aged, And the base toward the honorable.
023	ISA	003	006	Then shall a man take hold of his brother in his father's house, [[and say, ]] Thou hast yet clothing, Be thou our ruler, And take this ruin into thy hands!
023	ISA	003	007	But in that day shall he lift up his hand, and say: I am no healer; In my house is neither bread nor raiment; Make not me ruler of the people!
023	ISA	003	008	For Jerusalem tottereth, and Judah falleth, Because their tongues and their deeds are against Jehovah, To provoke his holy eyes.
023	ISA	003	009	Their very countenance witnesseth against them; They publish their sin like Sodom; they hide it not; Woe to them, for they bring evil upon themselves!
023	ISA	003	010	Say ye of the righteous that it shall be well with him, For he shall eat the fruit of his doings.
023	ISA	003	011	Woe to the wicked, it shall be ill with him, For the work of his hands shall be repaid him!
023	ISA	003	012	As for my people, children are their oppressors, And women rule over them. O my people, thy leaders cause thee to err, And destroy the way in which thou walkest!
023	ISA	003	013	Jehovah standeth up to maintain his cause; He standeth up to judge his people.
023	ISA	003	014	Jehovah entereth into judgment with the elders of his people, and their princes: “So then ye have consumed the vineyard; The plunder of the poor is in your houses!
023	ISA	003	015	What mean ye, that ye crush my people, And grind the faces of the poor?” Saith Jehovah, the Lord of hosts.
023	ISA	003	016	Thus, also, saith Jehovah: Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, And walk with outstretched necks, And glance their eyes wantonly, Mincing their steps as they go, And tinkling with their foot-clasps,
023	ISA	003	017	Therefore will the Lord make their heads bald, And Jehovah will expose their nakedness.
023	ISA	003	018	In that day shall the Lord take from them The ornaments of the foot-clasps, and the net-works, and the crescents;
023	ISA	003	019	The ear-rings, and the bracelets, and the veils;
023	ISA	003	020	The turbans, and the ankle-chains, and the belts; The perfume-boxes, and the amulets;
023	ISA	003	021	The finger-rings, and the nose-jewels;
023	ISA	003	022	The embroidered robes, and the tunics, and the cloaks, and the purses;
023	ISA	003	023	The mirrors, and the linen shifts, and the head-bands, and the large veils.
023	ISA	003	024	And instead of perfume there shall be corruption; Instead of a belt, a rope; Instead of curled locks, baldness; Instead of a wide mantle, a covering of sackcloth; Fire-scars instead of beauty.
023	ISA	003	025	Thy men shall fall by the sword, Yea, thy mighty men in battle;
023	ISA	003	026	Her gates shall lament and mourn, And she, being desolate, shall sit upon the ground.
023	ISA	004	001	In that day shall seven women lay hold of one man saying: We will eat our own bread, And wear our own garments, Only let us be called by thy name, And take away our reproach!
023	ISA	004	002	In that day shall the increase of Jehovah be glorious and honorable, And the fruit of the land excellent and beautiful, For them that have escaped of Israel.
023	ISA	004	003	All that remain in Zion, And all that are left in Jerusalem, Shall be called holy; Every one that is written down for life in Jerusalem.
023	ISA	004	004	When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, And have removed the blood of Jerusalem from the midst of her, By a spirit of judgment and a spirit of destruction,
023	ISA	004	005	Then shall Jehovah create upon the whole extent of mount Zion, and upon her places of assembly, A cloud and smoke by day, And the brightness of a flaming fire by night; Yea, for all that is glorious there shall be a shelter;
023	ISA	004	006	There shall be a tent by day for a shadow from the heat, And for a refuge and shelter from the storm and rain.
023	ISA	005	001	Let me sing now a song respecting my friend, A song respecting my friend touching his vineyard. My friend had a vineyard On a very fruitful hill;
023	ISA	005	002	He digged it, and cleared it of stones, And planted it with the choicest vine, And built a tower in the midst of it, And hewed out a wine-press therein; Then he looked that it should bring forth its grapes, But it brought forth sour grapes.
023	ISA	005	003	And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, Judge ye between me and my vineyard!
023	ISA	005	004	What could have been done for my vineyard That I have not done for it? Why, then, when I looked that it should bring forth its grapes, Brought it forth sour grapes?
023	ISA	005	005	But come now, and I will tell you What I mean to do with my vineyard. I will take away its hedge, and it shall be eaten up; I will break down its wall, and it shall be trodden down!
023	ISA	005	006	And I will make it a waste; It shall not be pruned, nor digged, But shall grow up into thorns and briers; I will also command the clouds That they shed no rain upon it.
023	ISA	005	007	The vineyard of Jehovah of hosts is the house of Israel, And the men of Judah the plant of his delight. He looked for justice, and behold, bloodshed! For righteousness, and behold, outcry!
023	ISA	005	008	Woe to them that join house to house, That add field to field, Till there is no place left, And they dwell alone in the land.
023	ISA	005	009	To mine ear hath Jehovah of hosts revealed it: Surely many houses shall become a desolation, The great and the fair ones, without an inhabitant.
023	ISA	005	010	Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall yield a single bath of wine, And a homer of seed shall produce but an ephah.
023	ISA	005	011	Woe to them that rise early in the morning to follow strong drink, —Who sit late in the night that wine may inflame them!
023	ISA	005	012	And the lyre and the harp, the tabret and the pipe, and wine, are at their feasts, But they regard not the work of Jehovah, Nor attend to the operation of his hands.
023	ISA	005	013	Therefore shall my people be led captive, when they think not of it; Their honorable men shall be famished with hunger, And their rich men parched with thirst.
023	ISA	005	014	Therefore doth the under-world enlarge its greedy throat, And stretch open its mouth without measure, And down go her nobility and her wealth, Her busy throng, and all that was joyful within her.
023	ISA	005	015	The mean man shall be bowed down, And the great man shall be brought low, And the eyes of the haughty shall be humbled;
023	ISA	005	016	Jehovah of hosts shall be exalted through judgment; Yea, God, the Holy One, shall be sanctified through righteousness.
023	ISA	005	017	Then shall the lambs feed, as in their own pasture, And the deserted fields of the rich shall strangers consume.
023	ISA	005	018	Woe to them that draw calamity with cords of wickedness, And punishment as with wagon-traces, —
023	ISA	005	019	Who say, Let him make speed, let him hasten his work that we may see it! Let the purpose of the Holy One of Israel draw near and be fulfilled, that we may know it!
023	ISA	005	020	Woe to them that call evil good, and good evil, That put darkness for light, and light for darkness, That put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!
023	ISA	005	021	Woe to them that are wise in their own eyes, And prudent in their own conceit!
023	ISA	005	022	Woe to them that are valiant to drink wine, And men of might to mingle strong drink!
023	ISA	005	023	That clear the guilty for a reward, And take away from the righteous his right!
023	ISA	005	024	Therefore, as fire devours stubble, And as the withered grass sinks into the flame, So their root shall become rottenness, And their blossom shall fly up like dust. For they have despised the law of Jehovah of hosts, And contemned the word of the Holy One of Israel.
023	ISA	005	025	Therefore is the anger of Jehovah kindled against his people; He stretcheth forth his hand against them, and smiteth them, so that the mountains tremble, And their carcasses are as dung in the midst of the streets; For all this his anger is not turned away, But his hand is stretched out still.
023	ISA	005	026	He lifteth up a banner for the nations afar off, He whistleth for them from the ends of the earth, And behold, they haste, and come swiftly.
023	ISA	005	027	None among them is weary, and none stumbleth; None slumbereth nor sleepeth; The girdle of their loins is not loosed, Nor the latchet of their shoes broken.
023	ISA	005	028	Their arrows are sharp, And all their bows bent; The hoofs of their horses are like flint, And their wheels like a whirlwind.
023	ISA	005	029	Their roaring is like the roaring of the lion; They roar like young lions; They roar, and seize the prey; They bear it away, and none can rescue it.
023	ISA	005	030	Yea, in that day shall they roar against them like the roaring of the sea; And if one look to the land, behold darkness and sorrow, And the light is darkened by its clouds.
023	ISA	006	001	In the year in which King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting on a throne high and lifted up, and the train of his robe filled the temple.
023	ISA	006	002	Around him stood seraphs; each one of them had six wings; with two he covered his face, with two he covered his feet, and with two he did fly.
023	ISA	006	003	And one called to another, and said: Holy, holy, holy is Jehovah of hosts; The whole earth is full of his glory.
023	ISA	006	004	And the foundations of the thresholds were shaken with the voice of their cry. And the temple was filled with smoke.
023	ISA	006	005	Then I said, Alas for me! I am undone! For I am a man of unclean lips, and dwell among a people of unclean lips, and mine eyes have seen the King, Jehovah of hosts.
023	ISA	006	006	Then flew one of the seraphs to me, having in his hands a glowing stone, which he had taken with the tongs from the altar.
023	ISA	006	007	And he touched my mouth, and said, Behold, this toucheth thy lips, and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin is expiated.
023	ISA	006	008	And I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? And I said: Behold, here am I; send me!
023	ISA	006	009	And he said: Go, and say thou to this people, Hear ye, indeed, but understand not; See ye, indeed, but perceive not!
023	ISA	006	010	Make the heart of this people gross; Make their ears dull, and blind their eyes; That they may not see with their eyes, nor hear with their ears, Nor perceive with their hearts, and turn, and be healed.
023	ISA	006	011	Then said I, How long, Lord? He said: Until the cities be laid waste, so that there be no inhabitant, And the houses, so that there be no man, And the land be left utterly desolate;
023	ISA	006	012	Until Jehovah have removed the men far away, And there be great desolation in the land.
023	ISA	006	013	And though there be a tenth part remaining in it, Even this shall again be destroyed; Yet as when the terebinth and the oak are cut down, Their stem remaineth alive, So shall a holy race be the stem of the nation.
023	ISA	007	001	In the time of Ahaz, the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, Rezin, king of Syria, and Pekah, the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, came up against Jerusalem to besiege it; but he could not prevail against it.
023	ISA	007	002	And when it was told the house of David, that the Syrians had encamped in Ephraim, his heart was moved, and the hearts of his people, as the trees of the forest are moved with the wind.
023	ISA	007	003	Then said Jehovah to Isaiah, Go forth to meet Ahaz, thou and Shear-Jashub thy son, at the end of the aqueduct of the upper pool, in the way to the fuller's field;
023	ISA	007	004	and say to him: Take heed, and be quiet! Fear not, neither let thy heart he faint On account of the two tails of these smoking firebrands, On account of the fierce wrath of Rezin with the Syrians, and of the son of Remaliah,
023	ISA	007	005	Because Syria deviseth evil against thee, Ephraim and the son of Remaliah, saying,
023	ISA	007	006	“Let us go up against Judah, and besiege the city, And take it, And set a king in the midst of it, Even the son of Tabeal.”
023	ISA	007	007	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: “It shall not stand, neither shall it be;
023	ISA	007	008	But the head of Syria shall still be Damascus, And the head of Damascus, Rezin; [[And within threescore and five years shall Ephraim be broken, that he be no more a people.]]
023	ISA	007	009	And the head of Ephraim shall still be Samaria, And the head of Samaria, the son of Remaliah. If ye will not believe, neither shall ye thrive.”
023	ISA	007	010	Jehovah spake also again to Ahaz:
023	ISA	007	011	“Ask thee a sign of Jehovah, thy God; Ask it from below, or in the height above!”
023	ISA	007	012	And Ahaz said, I will not ask; I will not tempt Jehovah!
023	ISA	007	013	Then he said, Hear ye now, O house of David! Is it too small a thing for you to weary men, That ye should weary my God also?
023	ISA	007	014	Therefore shall Jehovah himself give you a sign: Behold, the damsel shall conceive, and bear a son, And she shall call his name Immanuel.
023	ISA	007	015	Milk and honey shall he eat, Until he learn to refuse the evil, and choose the good;
023	ISA	007	016	For before this child shall have learned to refuse the evil and choose the good, The land shall become desolate, On account of whose two kings thou art in terror.
023	ISA	007	017	Yet Jehovah shall bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon thy father's house, Days such as have not been Since Ephraim revolted from Judah. [[Even the king of Assyria.]]
023	ISA	007	018	And it shall come to pass in that day That Jehovah shall whistle for the fly that is at the end of the streams of Egypt, And the bee that is in the land of Assyria,
023	ISA	007	019	And they shall come, and light all of them In the desolate valleys, and fissures of the rocks, And upon all hedges, and upon all pastures.
023	ISA	007	020	In that day shall Jehovah shave, with a razor hired beyond the river, [[with the king of Assyria, ]] The head, and the hair of the feet; Yea, even the beard shall he take away.
023	ISA	007	021	And it shall come to pass in that day, That a man shall keep a young cow, and two sheep;
023	ISA	007	022	And for the abundance of milk which they produce, shall he eat cheese; For milk and honey shall all eat Who are left in the land,
023	ISA	007	023	And it shall come to pass in that day, That every place where stood a thousand vines, worth a thousand shekels of silver, Shall be covered with briers and thorns.
023	ISA	007	024	With arrows and with bows shall men go thither; For all the land shall become briers and thorns.
023	ISA	007	025	All the hills that were digged with the mattock Shall no one approach through fear of briers and thorns; They shall be for the pasturage of oxen, And the trampling of sheep.
023	ISA	008	001	And Jehovah said to me, Take thee a great tablet, and with a man's writing-instrument write on it, Hasteth-the-prey, Speedeth-the-spoil.
023	ISA	008	002	And I took with me faithful witnesses, Uriah the priest, and Zechariah, the son of Berechiah.
023	ISA	008	003	I went in to the prophetess, and she conceived and bore a son. Then said Jehovah to me, Call his name, Hasteth-the-prey, Speedeth-the-spoil.
023	ISA	008	004	For before the child shall learn to say, My father, and My mother, the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be borne away before the king of Assyria.
023	ISA	008	005	Moreover, Jehovah spake to me again, saying:
023	ISA	008	006	Because this people despiseth The soft-flowing waters of Siloah, And rejoiceth in Rezin, and the son of Remaliah,
023	ISA	008	007	Therefore, behold, the Lord bringeth upon them the strong and mighty waters of the river; [[The king of Assyria and all his glory.]] He shall rise above all his channels, And go over all his banks.
023	ISA	008	008	And he shall pass through Judah, overflowing and spreading; Even to the neck shall he reach, And his stretched-out wings shall fill the whole breadth of thy land, O Immanuel!
023	ISA	008	009	Rage, ye nations, and despair! Give ear, all ye distant parts of the earth! Gird yourselves, and despair! Gird yourselves, and despair!
023	ISA	008	010	Form your plan, and it shall come to naught; Give the command, and it shall not stand; For God is with us.
023	ISA	008	011	For thus spake Jehovah to me with a strong hand, Instructing me not to walk in the way of this people:
023	ISA	008	012	Call not everything a confederacy which this people calleth a confederacy; Fear ye not what they fear, Neither be afraid!
023	ISA	008	013	Jehovah of hosts, sanctify ye him; Let him be your fear, and let him be your dread!
023	ISA	008	014	And he shall be to you a sanctuary; But a stone of stumbling, and a rock to strike against, To the two houses of Israel, A trap and a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
023	ISA	008	015	And many among them shall stumble; They shall fall, and be broken; They shall be ensnared and taken.
023	ISA	008	016	Bind up the revelation, Seal the word, with my disciples!
023	ISA	008	017	I will, therefore, wait for Jehovah, Who now hideth his face from the house of Jacob; Yet will I look for him.
023	ISA	008	018	Behold, I, and the children which Jehovah hath given me, Are signs and tokens in Israel From Jehovah of hosts, who dwelleth upon mount Zion.
023	ISA	008	019	And when they shall say to you, “Inquire of the necromancers and the wizards, That chirp, and that murmur,” [[Then say ye, ]] “Should not a people inquire of their God? Should they inquire of the dead for the living?”
023	ISA	008	020	To the word, to the revelation! If they speak not according to this, For them no bright morning shall arise.
023	ISA	008	021	They shall pass through the land distressed and famished; And when they are famished, they shall be enraged, and curse their king and their God, And look upward.
023	ISA	008	022	And if they look to the earth, Behold distress and darkness, fearful darkness! And into darkness shall they be driven.
023	ISA	009	001	But the darkness shall not remain where now is distress; Of old he brought the land of Zebulon and the land of Naphtali into contempt; In future times shall he bring the land of the sea beyond Jordan, the circle of the gentiles, into honor.
023	ISA	009	002	The people that walk in darkness behold a great light; They who dwell in the land of death-like shade, Upon them a light shineth.
023	ISA	009	003	Thou enlargest the nation; Thou increasest their joy; They rejoice before thee with the joy of harvest, With the joy of those who divide the spoil.
023	ISA	009	004	For thou breakest their heavy yoke, And the rod that smote their backs, And the scourge of the taskmaster, As in the day of Midian.
023	ISA	009	005	For every greave of the warrior in battle, And the war-garment rolled in blood, Shall be burned; yea, it shall be food for the fire.
023	ISA	009	006	For to us a child is born, To us a son is given, And the government shall be upon his shoulder, And he shall be called Wonderful, counsellor, mighty potentate, Everlasting father, prince of peace;
023	ISA	009	007	His dominion shall be great, And peace without end shall be upon the throne of David and his kingdom, To fix and establish it Through justice and equity, Henceforth and forever. The zeal of Jehovah of hosts will do this.
023	ISA	009	008	The Lord sendeth a word against Jacob; It cometh down to Israel.
023	ISA	009	009	His whole people shall feel it, Ephraim, and the inhabitants of Samaria, Who say in pride and arrogance of heart,
023	ISA	009	010	“The bricks are fallen down, but we will build with hewn stones; The sycamores are cut down, but we will replace them with cedars.”
023	ISA	009	011	Jehovah will raise up the enemies of Rezin against them, And will arm their adversaries;
023	ISA	009	012	The Syrians before, the Philistines behind, Who shall devour Israel with wide jaws. For all this his anger is not turned away, But his hand is stretched out still.
023	ISA	009	013	The people turn not to him that smiteth them; Neither do they seek Jehovah of hosts.
023	ISA	009	014	Therefore shall Jehovah cut off from Israel the head and the tail, The palm-branch and the rush, in one day.
023	ISA	009	015	[[The aged and the honorable are the head, And the prophet that speaketh falsehood is the tail.]]
023	ISA	009	016	For the leaders of this people lead them astray, And they that are led by them go to destruction.
023	ISA	009	017	Therefore shall the Lord have no joy in their young men, And on their orphans and widows he shall have no compassion; For they are all profane, and evil-doers; Every mouth speaketh folly. For all this his anger is not turned away, But his hand is stretched out still.
023	ISA	009	018	For wickedness burneth like a fire, It consumeth the briers and thorns, And it kindleth the thicket of the forest, So that it goeth up in columns of smoke.
023	ISA	009	019	Through the wrath of Jehovah of hosts is the land burned, And the people are food for the fire; No one spareth another.
023	ISA	009	020	They consume on the right hand, and yet are hungry; They devour on the left, and are not satisfied; Every one devoureth the flesh of his arm.
023	ISA	009	021	Manasseh is against Ephraim, and Ephraim against Manasseh, And both together against Judah. For all this his anger is not turned away, But his hand is stretched out still.
023	ISA	010	001	Woe to them that make unrighteous decrees, That write oppressive decisions,
023	ISA	010	002	To turn away the needy from judgment, And rob the poor of my people of their right; That the widows may become their prey, And that they may plunder the orphans.
023	ISA	010	003	What will ye do in the day of visitation, And in the desolation which cometh from afar? To whom will ye flee for help, And where will ye leave your glory?
023	ISA	010	004	Forsaken by me, they shall sink down among the prisoners, And fall among the slain. For all this his anger is not turned away, But his hand is stretched out still.
023	ISA	010	005	Woe to the Assyrian, the rod of mine anger, The staff in whose hands is the instrument of my indignation!
023	ISA	010	006	Against an impious nation I will send him, And against a people under my wrath I will give him a charge To gather the spoil, and seize the prey, And to trample them under foot like the mire of the streets.
023	ISA	010	007	But he doth not so purpose, And his heart doth not so intend; But to destroy is in his heart, And to cut off a multitude of nations.
023	ISA	010	008	For he saith, “Are not my princes altogether kings?
023	ISA	010	009	Is not Calno as Carchemish? Is not Hamath as Arpad? Is not Samaria as Damascus?
023	ISA	010	010	As my hand hath seized the kingdoms of the idols, Whose graven images were more numerous than those of Jerusalem and Samaria,
023	ISA	010	011	Behold! as I have done to Samaria and her idols, So will I do to Jerusalem and her images.”
023	ISA	010	012	But when the Lord hath accomplished his whole work upon Mount Zion and Jerusalem, Then will he punish the fruit of the proud heart of the king of Assyria, And the arrogance of his lofty eyes.
023	ISA	010	013	For he hath said: “By the strength of my hand I have done it, And by my wisdom; for I am wise; I have removed the bounds of nations, I have plundered their treasures; As a hero have I brought down them that sat upon thrones.
023	ISA	010	014	The riches of the nations hath my hand seized, as a nest; As one gathereth eggs that have been left, So have I gathered the whole world. And there was none that moved the wing, Or that opened the beak, or that chirped.”
023	ISA	010	015	Shall the axe boast itself against him that heweth with it? Or shall the saw magnify itself against him that moveth it? As if the rod should wield him that lifteth it! As if the staff should lift up him that is not wood!
023	ISA	010	016	Wherefore the Lord, the Lord of hosts, shall send upon his fat ones leanness, And under his glory shall he kindle a burning, like the burning of a fire.
023	ISA	010	017	The light of Israel shall be a fire, And his Holy One a flame, Which shall burn and devour his thorns and briers in one day.
023	ISA	010	018	The glory of his forest and of his fruitful field From the spirit even to the flesh shall he consume; It shall be with them as when a sick man fainteth.
023	ISA	010	019	The remaining trees of the forest shall be few, So that a child may write them down.
023	ISA	010	020	In that day shall the remnant of Israel, and they that have escaped of the house of Jacob, no more lean upon him that smote them; They shall lean upon Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.
023	ISA	010	021	The remnant shall return, the remnant of Jacob, to the mighty Potentate;
023	ISA	010	022	For though thy people, O Israel, be as the sand of the sea, Only a remnant of them shall return. The devastation is decreed; It shall overflow with righteousness.
023	ISA	010	023	For devastation and punishment doth the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, execute in the midst of the whole land,
023	ISA	010	024	Yet thus saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts: Fear not, O my people, that dwellest in Zion, because of the Assyrian! With his rod indeed shall he smite thee, And lift up his staff against thee in the manner of Egypt;
023	ISA	010	025	But yet a very little while, and my indignation shall have past, And my anger shall destroy them.
023	ISA	010	026	Jehovah of hosts shall raise up against him a scourge, As he smote Midian at the rock of Horeb, And as he lifted up the rod against the sea; Yea, he shall lift it up, as in Egypt.
023	ISA	010	027	In that day shall his burden be removed from thy shoulder, And his yoke from thy neck; Yea, thy yoke shall be broken, as that of a fat steer.
023	ISA	010	028	He is come to Aiath; he passeth through Migron; In Michmash he leaveth his baggage;
023	ISA	010	029	They pass the strait; At Geba they make their night-quarters; Ramah trembleth; Gibeah of Saul fleeth.
023	ISA	010	030	Cry aloud, O daughter of Gallim! Hear, O Laish! Alas, poor Anathoth!
023	ISA	010	031	Madmenah hasteth away; The inhabitants of Gebim take to flight.
023	ISA	010	032	Yet one day shall he rest at Nob, Then shall he shake his hand against the mount of the daughter of Zion, The hill of Jerusalem.
023	ISA	010	033	But behold! the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, shall lop the branches with fearful force, And the high of stature shall be cut down, And the lofty shall be brought low.
023	ISA	010	034	He shall hew the thickets of the forest with iron, And Lebanon shall fall by a mighty hand.
023	ISA	011	001	Then shall spring forth a shoot from the stem of Jesse, And a sprout grow up from his roots.
023	ISA	011	002	The spirit of Jehovah shall rest upon him, The spirit of wisdom and understanding, The spirit of counsel and might, The spirit of the knowledge and of the fear of Jehovah,
023	ISA	011	003	He shall take delight in the fear of Jehovah; He shall not judge by the sight of his eyes, Nor decide by the hearing of his ears.
023	ISA	011	004	But with righteousness shall he judge the poor, And decide with equity for the afflicted of the land; He shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth; With the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked.
023	ISA	011	005	Righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, And faithfulness the girdle of his reins.
023	ISA	011	006	Then shall the wolf dwell with the lamb, And the leopard shall lie down with the kid; The calf, and the young lion, and the fatling shall be together, And a little child shall lead them.
023	ISA	011	007	The cow and the bear shall feed together, Together shall their young lie down, And the lion shall eat straw like the ox.
023	ISA	011	008	The suckling shall play upon the hole of the asp, And the near-weaned child lay his hand on the hiding-place of the basilisk.
023	ISA	011	009	They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain; For the land shall be full of the knowledge of Jehovah, As the waters cover the depths of the sea.
023	ISA	011	010	In that day shall the shoot of Jesse stand as a banner to the nations, And to him shall the gentiles repair, And his dwelling-place shall be glorious.
023	ISA	011	011	In that day shall Jehovah the second time stretch forth his hand To recover the remnant of his people, That remaineth, from Assyria, and from Egypt, And from Pathros, and from Ethiopia, and from Elam, And from Shinar, and from Hamath, And from the islands of the sea.
023	ISA	011	012	He shall set up a banner to the nations, And gather the outcasts of Israel, And bring together the dispersed of Judah, From the four extremities of the earth.
023	ISA	011	013	Then shall the jealousy of Ephraim depart, And the enmity in Judah be at an end; Ephraim shall not be jealous of Judah, And Judah shall not contend with Ephraim.
023	ISA	011	014	But they shall fly upon the shoulders of the Philistines at the sea; Together shall they plunder the children of the East; On Edom and Moab shall they lay their hand, And the sons of Ammon shall be subject to them.
023	ISA	011	015	Then will Jehovah utterly destroy the tongue of the Egyptian sea, And shake his hand over the river with a mighty wind, And smite it into seven streams, So that men may go over it dry-shod.
023	ISA	011	016	And it shall be a highway for the remnant of the people, Which shall remain, from Assyria, As there was to Israel, When he came up from the land of Egypt.
023	ISA	012	001	In that day shalt thou say, “I will praise thee, O Jehovah, for, though thou hast been angry with me, Thine anger is turned away, and thou comfortest me.
023	ISA	012	002	Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and will not be afraid; For Jehovah is my glory, and my song; It is he who was my salvation.”
023	ISA	012	003	Ye shall draw waters with joy from the fountains of salvation;
023	ISA	012	004	And in that day ye shall say, “Give thanks to Jehovah; call upon his name; Make known his deeds among the people; Give praises, for his name is exalted!
023	ISA	012	005	Sing to Jehovah, for he hath done glorious things; Be this known in all the earth!
023	ISA	012	006	Cry aloud, shout for joy, O inhabitant of Zion, For great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee!”
023	ISA	013	001	A prophecy concerning Babylon, which Isaiah, the son of Amoz, saw.
023	ISA	013	002	Upon the bare mountain lift up a banner; Cry aloud to them, wave the hand, That they may enter the gates of the tyrants!
023	ISA	013	003	I have given orders to my consecrated ones, Yea, I have called upon my mighty ones to execute mine anger, My proud exulters!
023	ISA	013	004	The noise of a multitude upon the mountains, like that of a great people! The tumultuous noise of kingdoms, of nations gathered together! Jehovah of hosts mustereth his army for battle.
023	ISA	013	005	They come from a distant country, From the end of Heaven, Jehovah and the instruments of his indignation. To lay waste the whole land.
023	ISA	013	006	Howl ye, for the day of Jehovah is at hand! Like a destruction from the Almighty, it cometh;
023	ISA	013	007	Therefore shall all hands hang down, And every heart of man shall melt.
023	ISA	013	008	They shall be in consternation; Distress and anguish shall lay hold of them; As a woman in travail shall they writhe; They shall look upon one another with amazement: Their faces shall glow like flames.
023	ISA	013	009	Behold! the day of Jehovah cometh, Terrible, full of wrath and burning indignation, To make the land a waste, And to destroy the sinners out of it.
023	ISA	013	010	For the stars of heaven, and the constellations thereof, Shall not give their light; The sun shall be darkened at his going forth, And the moon shall withhold her light.
023	ISA	013	011	For I will punish the world for its guilt, And the wicked for their iniquity. I will put an end to the arrogance of the proud, And I will bring down the haughtiness of the tyrants.
023	ISA	013	012	I will make men scarcer than gold; Yea, men than the gold of Ophir.
023	ISA	013	013	Therefore I will make the heavens tremble, And the earth shall be shaken out of her place, In the anger of Jehovah of hosts, In the day of his burning indignation.
023	ISA	013	014	Then shall they be like a chased doe; Like a flock, which no one gathereth together; Every one shall turn to his own people, And every one flee to his own land.
023	ISA	013	015	Every one that is overtaken shall be thrust through, And every one that is caught shall fall by the sword.
023	ISA	013	016	Their children shall be dashed to pieces before their eyes; Their houses shall be plundered, and their wives ravished.
023	ISA	013	017	Behold, I stir up against them the Medes, Who make no account of silver, And as to gold, they do not regard it.
023	ISA	013	018	Their bows shall strike down the young men, And on the fruit of the womb they shall have no compassion; Their eye shall not pity the children.
023	ISA	013	019	So shall Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, The proud ornament of the Chaldeans, Be like Sodom and Gomorrah, which God overthrew,
023	ISA	013	020	It shall never more be inhabited; Nor shall it be dwelt in through all generations. Nor shall the Arabian pitch his tent there, Nor shall shepherds make their folds there.
023	ISA	013	021	But there shall the wild beasts of the desert lodge, And owls shall fill their houses; And ostriches shall dwell there, And satyrs shall dance there.
023	ISA	013	022	Wolves shall howl in their palaces, And jackals in their pleasant edifices. Her time is near, And her days shall not be prolonged.
023	ISA	014	001	For Jehovah will have compassion upon Jacob, And will again set his love upon Israel, And cause them to rest in his own land. And strangers shall join themselves to them, And cleave to the house of Jacob.
023	ISA	014	002	The nations shall take them and bring them to their own place; And the house of Israel shall possess them, in the land of Jehovah, As servants and as handmaids; They shall take captive their captors, And they shall rule over their oppressors.
023	ISA	014	003	So when Jehovah shall have given thee rest From thy sorrow and thy distress, And from the hard bondage Which was laid upon thee,
023	ISA	014	004	Then shall thou utter this song over the king of Babylon, and say, “How hath the tyrant fallen, The oppression ceased!
023	ISA	014	005	Jehovah hath broken the staff of the wicked, The rod of the tyrants,
023	ISA	014	006	That smote the people in anger, With a continual stroke, That lorded it over the nations in wrath With unremitted oppression.
023	ISA	014	007	The whole earth is at rest, is quiet; They break forth into singing.
023	ISA	014	008	Even the cypress-trees exult over thee, And the cedars of Lebanon: 'Since thou art fallen, No feller cometh up against us.'
023	ISA	014	009	The under-world is in commotion on account of thee, To meet thee at thy coming; It stirreth up before thee the shades, all the mighty of the earth; It arouseth from their thrones all the kings of the nations;
023	ISA	014	010	They all accost thee, and say, 'Art thou, too, become weak as we? Art thou become like us?'
023	ISA	014	011	Thy pomp is brought down to the grave, And the sound of thy harps. Vermin have become thy couch, And worms thy covering.
023	ISA	014	012	How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! How art thou cast down to the ground, Thou that didst trample upon the nations!
023	ISA	014	013	Thou saidst in thy heart, 'I will ascend to heaven, Above the stars of God will I exalt my throne; I will sit upon the mount of assembly in the recesses of the north.
023	ISA	014	014	I will ascend above the height of the clouds; I will be like the Most High.'
023	ISA	014	015	But thou art brought down to the grave, To the depths of the pit.
023	ISA	014	016	They that see thee gaze upon thee, and view thee attentively, (and say, ) 'Is this the man that made the earth tremble, That shook kingdoms,
023	ISA	014	017	That made the world a wilderness, And laid waste its cities, And sent not his captives to their homes?'
023	ISA	014	018	All the kings of the nations, yea, all of them, Lie down in glory, each in his own sepulchre;
023	ISA	014	019	But thou art cast forth without a grave, Like a worthless branch; Covered with the slain, who are pierced by the sword, Who go down to the stones of the pit, Like a carcass trampled under foot.
023	ISA	014	020	Thou shalt not be joined with them in the grave, Because thou hast destroyed thy country, And slain thy people; The race of evil-doers shall nevermore be named.
023	ISA	014	021	Prepare ye slaughter for his children, For the iniquity of their fathers, That they may no more arise, and possess the earth, And fill the world with enemies!”
023	ISA	014	022	For I will arise against them, saith Jehovah of hosts, And I will cut off from Babylon the name and remnant, Posterity and offspring, saith Jehovah.
023	ISA	014	023	I will make her the possession of the porcupine, and pools of water; Yea, I will sweep her away with the besom of destruction, saith Jehovah of hosts.
023	ISA	014	024	Jehovah of hosts hath sworn, saying, Surely, as I have devised, so shall it come to pass, The purpose which I have formed, that shall stand,
023	ISA	014	025	To crush the Assyrian in my land, And to trample him on my mountains. Then shall his yoke depart from them, And his burden be removed from their shoulders.
023	ISA	014	026	This is the purpose which is formed concerning all the earth, And this the hand which is stretched out over all the nations.
023	ISA	014	027	For Jehovah of hosts hath decreed, and who shall disannul it? And his hand is stretched out, and who shall turn it back?
023	ISA	014	028	In the year in which Ahaz the king died came this prophecy.
023	ISA	014	029	Rejoice not, all Philistia, Because the rod that smote thee is broken, For from the root of a serpent shall come forth a basilisk, And his fruit shall be a flying, fiery serpent.
023	ISA	014	030	Then shall the most wretched of the poor feed quietly, And the needy shall lie down in security; For I will kill thy root with famine, And thy remnant shall be slain.
023	ISA	014	031	Howl, O gate! cry aloud, O city! O Philistia, thou meltest away in terror! For from the north cometh a smoke, And there is no straggler in their hosts.
023	ISA	014	032	What answer shall be given to the messengers of the nations? That Jehovah hath founded Zion, And in her shall the poor of his people find refuge.
023	ISA	015	001	The prophecy concerning Moab. Yea! in the night of assault was Ar of Moab a ruin! In the night of assault was Kir of Moab a ruin!
023	ISA	015	002	They go up to the temple, and to Dibon, to weep upon the high places; Upon Nebo and upon Medeba doth Moab howl; On every head is baldness, And every beard is shorn.
023	ISA	015	003	In their streets they gird themselves with sackcloth; On the tops of their houses and in their public walks every one howleth, And melteth away with weeping.
023	ISA	015	004	Heshbon and Elealah utter a cry; Even to Jahaz is their voice heard; Therefore the warriors of Moab shriek aloud; Their hearts tremble within them.
023	ISA	015	005	My heart crieth out for Moab, Whose fugitives wander to Zoar, to Eglath-shelishijah; For they ascend the heights of Luhith weeping, And in the way of Horonaim they raise the cry of destruction.
023	ISA	015	006	For the waters of Nimrim are desolate; The grass is withered; the tender plant faileth; There is no green thing left.
023	ISA	015	007	Wherefore the remnant of their substance and their wealth They shall carry to the brook of willows.
023	ISA	015	008	For the cry encompasseth the borders of Moab; Even to Eglaim reacheth her wailing, To Beer-Elim her howling.
023	ISA	015	009	For the waters of Dimon are full of blood; For I bring new evils upon Dimon; Upon him that escapeth of Moab will I send a lion, Even upon him that remaineth in the land.
023	ISA	016	001	Send ye the lambs to the ruler of the land, From Selah through the wilderness To the mount of the daughter of Zion!
023	ISA	016	002	For as a wandering bird, As a forthdriven nest, So shall be the daughters of Moab At the fords of Arnon; [[saying, ]]
023	ISA	016	003	“Offer counsel; give decision, Make thy shadow at noonday like the darkness of night. Hide the outcasts; Betray not the fugitives.
023	ISA	016	004	Let my outcasts dwell with thee, [[O Zion!]] Be thou to them a covert from the spoiler! For the extortion is at an end, The spoiling ceaseth. The oppressors are consumed from the land.
023	ISA	016	005	Then shall your throne be established through mercy, And upon it shall sit in the house of David A judge searching for justice, and prompt in equity.”
023	ISA	016	006	“We have beard of the pride of Moab; he is very proud; His haughtiness, and his pride, and his insolence, His vain boastings.”
023	ISA	016	007	Therefore shall Moab howl for Moab; Every one shall howl; For the ruins of Kir-hares shall ye mourn, In deep affliction.
023	ISA	016	008	For the fields of Heshbon languish, The lords of the nations break down the choicest shoots of the vine of Sibmah, They reached even to Jazer; they wandered into the desert; Her branches were spread out; they crossed the sea.
023	ISA	016	009	Therefore I will weep, like Jazer, for the vine of Sibmah; I will water thee with my tears, O Heshbon and Elealah, For upon thy summer fruits, and thy harvest, the war-shout is fallen.
023	ISA	016	010	Gladness and joy are driven from the fruitful field, And in the vineyards is no singing nor shouting; The treaders tread out no wine in their vats; I have made the vintage-shouting to cease.
023	ISA	016	011	Therefore shall my bowels sound like a harp for Moab, And my inward parts for Kir-hares.
023	ISA	016	012	And it shall come to pass that though Moab present himself, Though he weary himself upon his high places, And go up to his sanctuary to pray, Yet shall he not prevail.
023	ISA	016	013	This is the word which Jehovah spake concerning Moab of old.
023	ISA	016	014	But now saith Jehovah: Within three years, like the years of a hireling, The glory of Moab shall be put to shame, With all his great multitude; And the remnant shall be very small, and without strength.
023	ISA	017	001	The prophecy concerning Damascus. Behold, Damascus shall be no more a city; It shall become a heap of ruins.
023	ISA	017	002	The cities of Aroer shall be forsaken; They shall be pastures for flocks, Which shall lie down, and none shall make them afraid.
023	ISA	017	003	The fortress shall cease from Ephraim, And the kingdom from Damascus, and the rest of Syria; It shall be with them as with the glory of the children of Israel, Saith Jehovah of hosts.
023	ISA	017	004	In that day shall the glory of Jacob sink away, And the fatness of his flesh become leanness.
023	ISA	017	005	And it shall be as when the harvest-man gathereth the corn, And reapeth the ears with his arm; Yea, as when one gleaneth ears in the valley of Rephaim.
023	ISA	017	006	There shall be left in it only a gleaning, as in the olive-harvest, Two or three berries on the top of the highest bough, Four or five on the fruitful branches, Saith Jehovah, the God of Israel.
023	ISA	017	007	In that day shall a man have regard to his Maker, And his eyes shall look to the Holy One of Israel.
023	ISA	017	008	He shall not look to the altars, the work of his hands, Nor have respect to that which his fingers have made, The images of Astarte and the Sun-pillars.
023	ISA	017	009	In that day shall his fortified cities be like ruins in the forests, or on the mountain tops, Which the enemy left, in flight from the children of Israel; And the land shall be a desolation.
023	ISA	017	010	For thou hast forgotten the God of thy salvation, And hast not been mindful of the rock of thy strength; Therefore though thou plant beautiful plants, And set shoots from a foreign soil,
023	ISA	017	011	When thou hast planted them, though thou hedge them in, And in the morning bring thy plants to the blossom, Yet shall the harvest flee away, In the day of pain and desperate sorrow.
023	ISA	017	012	Alas! a tumult of many nations! They rage with the raging of the sea. Alas! a roaring of kingdoms! They roar with the roaring of mighty waters.
023	ISA	017	013	Like the roaring of mighty waters do the nations roar; He rebuketh them, and they flee away, Driven like the chaff of the mountains before the wind, Like stubble before the whirlwind.
023	ISA	017	014	At the time of evening, behold, terror! Before morning, behold, they are no more! This is the portion of them that spoil us, And the lot of them that plunder us.
023	ISA	018	001	Ho! thou land of rustling wings, Beyond the rivers of Ethiopia!
023	ISA	018	002	That sendest thy messengers upon the sea, In reed-boats upon the face of the waters: Go, ye swift messengers, to a nation tall and fair, To a people terrible from the first and onward, To a mighty, victorious people, Whose land is divided by rivers!
023	ISA	018	003	All ye inhabitants of the world, ye that dwell on the earth, When the standard is lifted up on the mountains, behold! When the trumpet is sounded, hear!
023	ISA	018	004	For thus hath Jehovah said to me: “I will sit still, and look on from my dwelling-place, Like a serene heat when the sun shineth, Like a dewy cloud in the heat of harvest.”
023	ISA	018	005	But before the vintage, when the bud is gone, And the blossom is ripening into a swelling grape, He shall cut off the shoots with pruning-hooks, And the branches he shall take away and cut down.
023	ISA	018	006	They shall be left together to the ravenous birds of the mountains, And to the wild beasts of the earth. The ravenous birds shall summer upon it, And every wild beast of the earth shall winter upon it.
023	ISA	018	007	At that time shall gifts be brought to Jehovah of hosts From a nation tall and fair, From a people terrible from the first and onward, A mighty, victorious people, Whose land is divided by rivers, To the dwelling-place of Jehovah of hosts, to mount Zion.
023	ISA	019	001	The prophecy concerning Egypt. Behold, Jehovah rideth upon a swift cloud, And cometh to Egypt; The gods of Egypt tremble at his presence, And the heart of Egypt melteth within her.
023	ISA	019	002	“I will set the Egyptians against the Egyptians; Brother shall fight against brother, And neighbor against neighbor; City against city, And kingdom against kingdom.
023	ISA	019	003	The spirit of Egypt shall fail within her, And her devices I will bring to naught. Then shall they consult the idols, and the sorcerers, And the necromancers, and the wizards.
023	ISA	019	004	But I will give up the Egyptians to the hands of a cruel lord, And a fierce king shall rule over them,” Saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts.
023	ISA	019	005	Then shall the waters fail from the river, Yea, the river shall be wasted and dried up.
023	ISA	019	006	The streams shall become putrid; The canals of Egypt shall be emptied and dried up; The reed and the rush shall wither.
023	ISA	019	007	The meadows by the river, by the borders of the river, And all that groweth by the river, Shall wither, be blasted, and be no more.
023	ISA	019	008	Then shall the fishermen mourn; All they that cast the hook into the river shall lament, And they that spread nets upon the face of the waters shall languish.
023	ISA	019	009	They, also, that work in flax, And they that weave white linen, shall be confounded.
023	ISA	019	010	Her pillars are broken down, And all who labor for hire are grieved in heart.
023	ISA	019	011	Surely the princes of Zoan are fools; The wise counsellors of Pharaoh have been stupid in their counsels. How, then, can ye say to Pharaoh, “I am the son of the wise, The son of ancient kings”?
023	ISA	019	012	Where are they now, thy wise men? Let them tell thee now, so that men may know it, What Jehovah of hosts hath determined concerning Egypt!
023	ISA	019	013	The princes of Zoan are become fools; The princes of Noph are deceived, Even the chiefs of her tribes have caused Egypt to err.
023	ISA	019	014	Jehovah hath mingled within her a spirit of perverseness, And they have caused Egypt to err in all her works, As a drunkard staggereth in his vomit.
023	ISA	019	015	There shall be nothing which can be done by Egypt, By the head, or the tail, the palm-branch, or the rush.
023	ISA	019	016	In that day shall the Egyptians be like women; They shall tremble and fear On account of the shaking of the hand of Jehovah of hosts, Which he shall shake against them.
023	ISA	019	017	The land of Judah shall be a terror to Egypt; Every one to whom it is mentioned shall tremble On account of the purpose of Jehovah of hosts, Which he hath determined against them.
023	ISA	019	018	In that day there shall be five cities in the land of Egypt Speaking the language of Canaan, And swearing by Jehovah of hosts; One of them shall be called the City of the Sun.
023	ISA	019	019	In that day there shall be an altar to Jehovah in the midst of the land of Egypt, And in the border of it a pillar to Jehovah,
023	ISA	019	020	Which shall be a sign and a witness For Jehovah of hosts in the land of Egypt, That they cried to Jehovah on account of their oppressors, And he sent them a saviour, and a defender, who delivered them.
023	ISA	019	021	Thus shall Jehovah be made known to Egypt, And the Egyptians shall know Jehovah in that day, And shall offer him sacrifices and oblations; They shall make vows to Jehovah, and perform them.
023	ISA	019	022	Thus Jehovah will smite Egypt; he will smite and heal her; They shall return to Jehovah; Therefore will he hear and heal them.
023	ISA	019	023	In that day shall there he a highway from Egypt to Assyria, And the Assyrian shall come into Egypt, And the Egyptian into Assyria, And the Egyptians shall worship with the Assyrians.
023	ISA	019	024	In that day shall Israel be the third In connection with Egypt and Assyria, A blessing in the midst of the earth.
023	ISA	019	025	Jehovah of hosts shall bless them, and say, Blessed be Egypt, my people, And Assyria, the work of my hands, And Israel, my inheritance!
023	ISA	020	001	In the year in which Tartan, being sent by Sargon, the king of Assyria, came to Ashdod, and fought against Ashdod, and took it,
023	ISA	020	002	at that time spake Jehovah through Isaiah the son of Amoz in this manner: Go, and loose the sackcloth from thy loins, and put off thy shoes from thy feet. And he did so, walking naked and barefoot.
023	ISA	020	003	And Jehovah said: As my servant Isaiah hath walked naked and barefoot three years, a sign and a token for Egypt and Ethiopia,
023	ISA	020	004	so shall the king of Assyria lead the captives of Egypt, and prisoners of Ethiopia, young and old, naked and barefoot, with their hind parts uncovered, to the shame of the Egyptians.
023	ISA	020	005	Then shall they be afraid and ashamed on account of Ethiopia their trust, and of Egypt their glory.
023	ISA	020	006	The inhabitant of this coast shall say in that day, “Behold, so is it with them in whom we trusted, and to whom we fled for help, that we might be delivered from the king of Assyria. How then shall we escape?”
023	ISA	021	001	The prophecy concerning the desert of the sea. As storms which rush along through the south, So it cometh from the desert, From the terrible land.
023	ISA	021	002	A grievous vision was revealed to me; The plunderer plundereth, and the destroyer destroyeth. “Go up, O Elam! Besiege, O Media! All sighing do I make to cease.”
023	ISA	021	003	Therefore are my loins full of pain; Pangs have seized me, as the pangs of a woman in travail; For convulsions I cannot hear; For anguish I cannot see.
023	ISA	021	004	My heart panteth, Terror hath seized upon me; The evening of my desire is changed into horror.
023	ISA	021	005	The table is prepared; the watch is set; They eat; they drink; “Arise, ye princes! Anoint the shield!”
023	ISA	021	006	For thus said the Lord unto me: “Go, set a watchman, Who shall declare what he seeth.”
023	ISA	021	007	And he saw a troop, horsemen in pairs, Riders on asses, and riders on camels, And he watched with the utmost heed.
023	ISA	021	008	Then he cried like a lion: “My Lord, I stand continually upon the watch-tower in the daytime, And keep my post all the night;
023	ISA	021	009	And behold, there cometh a troop, Horsemen in pairs.” Again also he lifted up his voice, and said: “Fallen, fallen is Babylon, And all the graven images of her gods are cast broken to the ground.”
023	ISA	021	010	O my threshing, and the corn of my floor! What I have heard from Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, That have I declared to you.
023	ISA	021	011	The prophecy concerning Dumah. A voice came to me from Seir: “Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?”
023	ISA	021	012	The watchman saith: “Morning cometh, and also night. If ye will inquire, inquire! Return, come!”
023	ISA	021	013	The prophecy against the Arabians. In the thickets of Arabia shall ye lodge, O ye caravans of Dedan!
023	ISA	021	014	The inhabitants of the land of Tema Bring water to the thirsty; They come to meet the fugitive with bread.
023	ISA	021	015	For they flee from swords, From the drawn sword, And from the bent bow, And from the fury of war.
023	ISA	021	016	For thus saith the Lord to me: Within one year, according to the years of a hireling, Shall all the glory of Kedar be consumed.
023	ISA	021	017	The remainder of the mighty bowmen of the sons of Kedar shall be diminished; For Jehovah, the God of Israel, hath said it.
023	ISA	022	001	The prophecy concerning the valley of vision. What aileth thee now, That all thine inhabitants are gone up to the house-tops?
023	ISA	022	002	Thou that wast full of noise, A tumultuous city, a joyous city! Thy slain fall not by the sword; They are not slain in battle.
023	ISA	022	003	All thy leaders flee together, By the bowmen are they bound; All found within thee are made captive together, Even they who have fled from afar.
023	ISA	022	004	Therefore, say I, look away from me, that I may weep bitterly; Strive not to comfort me for the desolation of the daughter of my people!
023	ISA	022	005	For a day of trouble, of desolation, and of perplexity cometh From the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, in the valley of vision. They break down the walls; The cry reacheth to the mountains.
023	ISA	022	006	Elam beareth the quiver, With chariots full of men, and with horsemen; Kir uncovereth the shield.
023	ISA	022	007	Thy fairest valleys, [[O Jerusalem, ]] are full of chariots; The horsemen set themselves in array against the gate;
023	ISA	022	008	The veil of Judah is torn from her. But in such a day ye look to the armor of the house of the forest;
023	ISA	022	009	Ye mark how many are the breaches of the city of David, And collect the waters of the lower pool;
023	ISA	022	010	Ye number the houses of Jerusalem, And ye break down the houses to prepare the wall;
023	ISA	022	011	Ye make a reservoir between the two walls for the waters of the old pool; But ye look not to Him who hath done this; Ye regard not Him that hath prepared this from afar.
023	ISA	022	012	The Lord, Jehovah of hosts, calleth you this day To weeping and to lamentation, To baldness and to girding with sackcloth.
023	ISA	022	013	But, behold, joy and gladness, Slaying oxen and killing sheep, Eating flesh and drinking wine! “Let us eat and drink, For to-morrow we die!”
023	ISA	022	014	Therefore it hath been revealed in my ears by Jehovah of hosts; “This iniquity shall not be forgiven you, till ye die,” Saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts.
023	ISA	022	015	Thus saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts: Go in to this steward, To Shebna, who is over the household, and say,
023	ISA	022	016	What hast thou here, and whom hast thou here, That thou here hewest thee out a sepulchre, —That thou hewest out thy sepulchre on high, And gravest out a habitation for thyself in the rock?
023	ISA	022	017	Behold, Jehovah will cast thee headlong with a mighty thrust;
023	ISA	022	018	He will violently roll thee together like a ball; Like a ball will he hurl thee into a wide country. There shalt thou die; And there shall be thy splendid chariots, Thou disgrace of the house of thy lord!
023	ISA	022	019	I will drive thee from thy post, And from thy station I will pull thee down.
023	ISA	022	020	In that day I will call my servant, Even Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah;
023	ISA	022	021	I will clothe him with thy robe, And bind thy girdle around him; Thy government will I commit to his hand, And he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, And to the house of Judah.
023	ISA	022	022	I will lay the key of the house of David upon his shoulder; He shall open, and none shall shut, And he shall shut, and none shall open.
023	ISA	022	023	I will fasten him as a peg in a sure place, And he shall be a glorious seat for his father's house.
023	ISA	022	024	Upon him shall hang all the glory of his father's house, The offspring and the offshoots; Every small vessel, from the goblet even to all the pitchers.
023	ISA	022	025	In that day, saith Jehovah of hosts, The peg that was once fastened in a sure place shall be moved; It shall be cut down, and fall, And the burden which was upon it shall come to the ground. For Jehovah hath said it.
023	ISA	023	001	The prophecy concerning Tyre. Howl, ye ships of Tarshish! For it is laid waste; No house, no entrance is left! From the land of the Chittaeans were the tidings brought to them.
023	ISA	023	002	Be amazed, ye inhabitants of the sea-coast, Which the merchants of Sidon, that pass over the sea, did crowd!
023	ISA	023	003	Upon the wide waters, the corn of the Nile, The harvest of the river, was her revenue; She was the mart of the nations.
023	ISA	023	004	Be thou ashamed, O Sidon, for the sea hath spoken, The fortress of the sea hath spoken thus: “I have not travailed, nor brought forth children; I have not nourished youths, nor brought up virgins.”
023	ISA	023	005	When the tidings shall reach Egypt, They shall be filled with anguish at the tidings concerning Tyre.
023	ISA	023	006	Pass ye over to Tarshish; Howl, ye inhabitants of the sea-coast!
023	ISA	023	007	Is this your joyous city, Whose antiquity is of ancient days? Now her own feet bear her To sojourn far away.
023	ISA	023	008	Who hath purposed this against Tyre, The dispenser of crowns, Whose merchants are princes, Whose traders the nobles of the earth?
023	ISA	023	009	Jehovah of hosts hath purposed it, To bring down the pride of all glory, To humble the nobles of the earth.
023	ISA	023	010	Go over thy land like the Nile, O daughter of Tarshish! Now thy bonds are broken.
023	ISA	023	011	He hath stretched out his hand over the sea, He hath made the kingdoms tremble; Jehovah hath given commandment concerning Canaan To destroy her strong holds.
023	ISA	023	012	He hath said, Thou shalt no more rejoice, Thou ravished virgin, daughter of Sidon! Arise, pass over to the Chittaeans; Yet even there shalt thou have no rest.
023	ISA	023	013	Behold the land of the Chaldaeans, Who, not long ago, were not a people, —The Assyrian assigned it to the inhabitants of the wilderness, —They raise their watch-towers; They destroy her palaces; They make her a heap of ruins.
023	ISA	023	014	Howl, ye ships of Tarshish! For your stronghold is destroyed.
023	ISA	023	015	And it shall come to pass in that day, That Tyre shall be forgotten seventy years, According to the days of one king; But at the end of seventy years It shall be with Tyre as in the song of the harlot:
023	ISA	023	016	“Take thy lyre, go about the city, O harlot, long forgotten; Make sweet melody; sing many songs, That thou mayst again be remembered!”
023	ISA	023	017	At the end of seventy years shall Jehovah show regard to Tyre, And she shall return to her hire, And play the harlot with all the kingdoms of the world, That are upon the face of the earth.
023	ISA	023	018	But her gain and her hire shall be holy to Jehovah; It shall not be treasured, nor laid up in store; But it shall be for them that dwell before Jehovah, For abundant food, and for splendid clothing.
023	ISA	024	001	Behold, Jehovah emptieth and draineth the land; Yea, he turneth it upside down, and scattereth its inhabitants.
023	ISA	024	002	As with the people, so is it with the priest; As with the servant, so with the master; As with the maid, so with the mistress; As with the buyer, so with the seller; As with the borrower, so with the lender; As with the usurer, so with the giver of usury.
023	ISA	024	003	The land is utterly emptied and utterly plundered; For Jehovah hath spoken this word.
023	ISA	024	004	The land mourneth, and withereth; The world languisheth, and withereth; The nobles of the people of the land do languish.
023	ISA	024	005	The land was polluted under its inhabitants, Because they transgressed the law, they violated the statutes, They broke the everlasting covenant.
023	ISA	024	006	Therefore a curse devoured the land; Its inhabitants suffered for their guilt; Therefore are the inhabitants of the land consumed with heat, And few of the men are left.
023	ISA	024	007	The new wine mourneth; The vine languisheth; All that were of a joyful heart do sigh;
023	ISA	024	008	The mirth of tabrets ceaseth; The noise of them that rejoice is at an end; The joy of the harp ceaseth.
023	ISA	024	009	No more do they drink wine with the song; Strong drink is bitter to them that use it.
023	ISA	024	010	The city of desolation is broken down; Every house is closed, so that none can enter.
023	ISA	024	011	There is a cry for wine in the streets; All gladness is departed; The mirth of the land is gone;
023	ISA	024	012	Desolation is left in the city, And the gate is smitten into ruins.
023	ISA	024	013	Yea, thus shall it be in the land, in the midst of the people, As when the olive-tree has been shaken; As the gleaning, when the vintage is ended.
023	ISA	024	014	These shall lift up their voice, and sing; Yea, for the majesty of Jehovah they shall shout from the sea.
023	ISA	024	015	Wherefore praise ye Jehovah in the East, The name of Jehovah, the God of Israel, in the isles of the sea!
023	ISA	024	016	From the end of the earth we hear songs: “Glory to the righteous!” But I cry, Alas, my wretchedness, my wretchedness! woe is me! The plunderers plunder; the plunderers seize the spoil.
023	ISA	024	017	The terror, the pit, and the snare Are upon thee, O inhabitant of the land!
023	ISA	024	018	Whoso fleeth from the terror shall fall into the pit, And whoso escapeth from the pit, He shall be taken in the snare; For the floodgates of heaven are opened, And the foundations of the earth tremble.
023	ISA	024	019	The earth is utterly broken down; The earth is shattered in pieces; The earth is violently moved from her place.
023	ISA	024	020	The earth reeleth like a drunkard, It moveth to and fro like a hammock; For her iniquity lieth heavy upon her, And she shall fall and rise no more.
023	ISA	024	021	In that day will Jehovah punish the host of the high ones that are on high, And the kings of the earth upon the earth.
023	ISA	024	022	They shall be thrown together bound into the pit, And shall be shut up in the prison, But after many days shall they be visited.
023	ISA	024	023	The moon shall be confounded and the sun ashamed, When Jehovah of hosts shall reign in mount Zion and Jerusalem, And his glory shall be before his ancients.
023	ISA	025	001	O Jehovah, thou art my God; I will exalt thee; I will praise thy name, For thou hast done wonderful things; Thine ancient purposes are faithfulness and truth.
023	ISA	025	002	Thou hast made the city a heap; The fortified city a ruin. The palace of the barbarians is to be no more a city! It shall never be built again.
023	ISA	025	003	Therefore shall mighty kingdoms praise thee; The cities of the terrible nations shall honor thee;
023	ISA	025	004	For thou hast been a defence to the poor; A defence to the needy in his distress; A refuge from the storm, a shadow from the heat, When the rage of tyrants was like a storm against a wall.
023	ISA	025	005	As heat in a dry land is made to vanish, So thou puttest down the tumult of the barbarians; As heat is allayed by a thick cloud, So the triumph of the tyrants is brought low.
023	ISA	025	006	Then in this mountain shall Jehovah of hosts prepare for all nations A feast of fat things, and wines kept on the lees; Of fat things full of marrow, of wines kept on the lees well refined.
023	ISA	025	007	He will destroy in this mountain the covering that was cast over all people, And the veil that was spread over all nations.
023	ISA	025	008	He will destroy death forever; The Lord Jehovah will wipe away the tears from all faces, And the reproach of his people will he take away from the whole earth; For Jehovah hath said it.
023	ISA	025	009	In that day shall men say, “Behold, this is our God; We waited for him, and he hath saved us; This is Jehovah, for whom we waited; Let us rejoice and exult in his salvation.”
023	ISA	025	010	For the hand of Jehovah shall rest upon this mountain, And Moab shall be trodden down in his place, As straw is trodden down in a dung-pool.
023	ISA	025	011	And he shall stretch out his hands in the midst of it, As the swimmer stretcheth out his hands to swim, But God shall put down his pride, Together with the devices of his hands.
023	ISA	025	012	And the high bulwarks of thy walls will he lay low; He will bring them down to the ground; he will lay them in the dust.
023	ISA	026	001	In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah: “We have a strong city; His aid doth God appoint for walls and bulwarks.
023	ISA	026	002	Open ye the gates, That the righteous nation may enter in, The nation that keepeth the truth.
023	ISA	026	003	Him that is of a steadfast mind Thou wilt keep in continual peace, Because he trusteth in thee.
023	ISA	026	004	Trust ye in Jehovah forever, For the Lord Jehovah is an everlasting rock.
023	ISA	026	005	For he hath brought down the inhabitants of the fortress; The lofty city he hath laid low; He hath laid her low even to the ground; He hath levelled her with the dust.
023	ISA	026	006	The foot trampleth upon her, The feet of the poor, the steps of the needy.
023	ISA	026	007	The way of the upright is a smooth way; Thou, O most righteous, doth level the path of the upright!
023	ISA	026	008	In the way of thy judgments, O Jehovah, we have waited for thee; The desire of our souls is to thy name, and to the remembrance of thee.
023	ISA	026	009	My soul longeth for thee in the night, And my spirit within me seeketh thee in the morning; For when thy judgments are in the earth, The inhabitants of the world learn righteousness.
023	ISA	026	010	Though favor be shown to the wicked, He will not learn righteousness; In the land of uprightness will he deal unjustly, And have no regard to the majesty of Jehovah.
023	ISA	026	011	Thy hand, O Jehovah, is lifted up, yet do they not see; But they shall see with shame thy zeal for thy people; Yea, fire shall devour thine adversaries.
023	ISA	026	012	Thou, O Jehovah, wilt give us peace; For all our works thou doest for us.
023	ISA	026	013	O Jehovah, our God, other lords have had dominion over us besides thee; Only through thee do we call upon thy name.
023	ISA	026	014	They are dead, they shall not live; They are shades, they shall not rise. For thou hast visited and destroyed them, And caused all the memory of them to perish.
023	ISA	026	015	“Thou wilt enlarge the nation, O Jehovah! Thou wilt enlarge the nation; thou wilt glorify thyself; Thou wilt widely extend all the borders of the land.
023	ISA	026	016	O Jehovah, in affliction they sought thee; They poured out their prayer, when thy chastisement was upon them.
023	ISA	026	017	As a woman with child, when her delivery is near, Is in anguish, and crieth aloud in her pangs, So have we been, far from thy presence, O Jehovah!
023	ISA	026	018	We have been with child; we have been in anguish, Yet have, as it were, brought forth wind. To the land we bring no deliverance; Nor are the inhabitants of the land born.
023	ISA	026	019	O might thy dead live again, Might the dead bodies of my people arise! Awake, and sing, ye that dwell in the dust! For thy dew is like the dew upon plants, And the earth shall bring forth her dead.”
023	ISA	026	020	Come, my people, enter into thy chambers, And shut thy doors behind thee; Hide thyself for a little moment, Until the indignation be overpast!
023	ISA	026	021	For behold, Jehovah cometh forth from his place, To punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity; And the earth shall disclose her blood, And shall no longer cover her slain.
023	ISA	027	001	In that day will Jehovah punish with his sword, His hard, and great, and strong sword, The leviathan, that fleet serpent, Even the leviathan, that winding serpent; Yea, he will slay the monster, that is in the sea.
023	ISA	027	002	In that day, sing ye thus concerning the vineyard:
023	ISA	027	003	“I, Jehovah, am its guardian; I will water it every moment; That no one may assault it, I will watch it day and night.
023	ISA	027	004	There is no fury in me; But let me find the thorns and thistles in battle. I will go against them, And burn them up together,
023	ISA	027	005	Unless they take hold of my protection, And with me make peace, And make peace with me.”
023	ISA	027	006	In coming days shall Jacob take root, And Israel flourish and bud forth, And fill the world with fruit.
023	ISA	027	007	Did he smite Israel, as he smote those that smote him? Was he slain as those that slew him?
023	ISA	027	008	In measure, by sending her away, didst thou punish her, Taking her away in the rough tempest, in the day of the east wind.
023	ISA	027	009	By this, therefore, is the iniquity of Jacob expiated, And this is wholly the fruit of the removal of his sin, That He has made the stones of the altar like limestones broken in pieces, And that the images of Astarte and the sun-pillars no more stand.
023	ISA	027	010	For the fortified city is desolate, A habitation forsaken, deserted like a wilderness; There doth the calf feed, and there doth he lie down, And consume her branches.
023	ISA	027	011	When her boughs are withered, they are broken off; Women come, and burn them; For it was a people of no understanding; Therefore he that made him had not mercy on him, And he that formed him showed him no favor.
023	ISA	027	012	But it shall come to pass in that day, That Jehovah shall gather fruit From the stream of the Euphrates to the river of Egypt, And ye shall be gathered, one by one, ye children of Israel!
023	ISA	027	013	In that day shall a great trumpet be sounded, And they shall come who are lost in the land of Assyria, And are outcasts in the land of Egypt, And shall worship Jehovah upon the holy mountain in Jerusalem.
023	ISA	028	001	Woe to the proud crown of the drunkards of Ephraim, To the fading flower, his glorious beauty, At the head of the rich valley of a people stupefied with wine.
023	ISA	028	002	Behold a strong, a mighty one from the Lord Like a storm of hail, like a destructive tempest, Like a flood of mighty, overflowing waters, With violence shall dash it to the ground.
023	ISA	028	003	It shall be trodden under foot, The proud crown of the drunkards of Ephraim.
023	ISA	028	004	And the fading flower, their glorious beauty, At the head of the rich valley, Shall be as the early fig before the time of harvest, Which whoso seeth plucketh immediately, And swalloweth as soon as it is in his hand.
023	ISA	028	005	In that day shall Jehovah of hosts Be a glorious crown, and a beautiful diadem to the residue of his people;
023	ISA	028	006	A spirit of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment, And of strength to them that drive back the enemy to their gates.
023	ISA	028	007	But even these stagger through wine, And reel through strong drink; The priest and the prophet stagger through strong drink; They are overpowered with wine; They stumble through strong drink; They reel in vision, They stagger in judgment.
023	ISA	028	008	For all their tables are full of filthy vomit, So that there is no place clean.
023	ISA	028	009	“Whom,” say they, “will he teach knowledge, And to whom will he impart instruction? To the weaned from the milk? To those just taken from the breast?
023	ISA	028	010	For it is precept upon precept, precept upon precept, Command upon command, command upon command, A little here, and a little there.”
023	ISA	028	011	Yea, with stammering lips and a strange tongue He shall indeed speak to this people;
023	ISA	028	012	He that said to them, “This is the way of rest, give rest to the weary; This is the way of safety”; But they would not hear.
023	ISA	028	013	Then shall the word of Jehovah be indeed to them “Precept upon precept, precept upon precept, Command upon command, command upon command, A little here, and a little there,” So that they shall go on, and fall backwards, and be broken, And be snared and caught.
023	ISA	028	014	Wherefore hear ye the word of Jehovah, Ye scoffers, who rule this people in Jerusalem!
023	ISA	028	015	Since ye say, “We have entered into a covenant with death, And with the under-world have we made an agreement, The overflowing scourge, when it passeth through, shall not reach us; For we have made falsehood our refuge, And in deceit we have hidden ourselves.”
023	ISA	028	016	Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I have laid in Zion as a foundation a stone, A tried stone, a precious corner-stone, a sure foundation; He that trusteth shall not flee away.
023	ISA	028	017	I will make justice a line, And righteousness a plummet, And the hail shall sweep away the refuge of falsehood, And the waters shall overwhelm its hiding-place;
023	ISA	028	018	And your covenant with death shall be broken, And your agreement with the under-world shall not stand; When the overflowing scourge shall pass through, By it shall ye be beaten down.
023	ISA	028	019	As often as it passeth through, it shall bear you away; For every morning shall it pass through, By day and by night; Even to hear the rumor of it shall be terrible.
023	ISA	028	020	Yea, the bed is too short for one to stretch himself on it, And the covering too narrow for one to wrap himself in it.
023	ISA	028	021	For Jehovah will rise up, as in mount Perazim; He will be moved with anger, as in the valley of Gibeon, To perform his act, his strange act, And to execute his work, his strange work.
023	ISA	028	022	Now, therefore, be ye no longer scoffers, Lest your bands become stronger; For destruction and punishment have been revealed to me From Jehovah of hosts concerning the whole land!
023	ISA	028	023	Give ear, and listen to my voice, Attend, and hearken to my words!
023	ISA	028	024	Is the ploughman always ploughing in order to sow? Is he always opening and harrowing his field?
023	ISA	028	025	When he hath made the face thereof even, Doth he not then scatter the dill, and cast abroad the cumin, And sow the wheat in rows, And the barley in its appointed place, And the spelt in his border?
023	ISA	028	026	Thus his God rightly instructeth him, And giveth him knowledge.
023	ISA	028	027	The dill is not beaten out with the thrashing-sledge, Nor is the wheel of the wain rolled over the cumin; But the dill is beaten out with a staff, And the cumin with a rod.
023	ISA	028	028	Bread-corn is beaten out, Yet doth not the husbandman thrash it without limit. He driveth over it the wheels of the wain, And the horses, yet doth he not utterly crush it.
023	ISA	028	029	This also proceedeth from Jehovah of hosts; He is wonderful in counsel, Excellent in wisdom.
023	ISA	029	001	Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, The city where David dwelt! Add year to year, Let the festivals go round,
023	ISA	029	002	Then will I distress Ariel; Mourning and sorrow shall be there; Yet shall she be to me as Ariel [[the lion of God]].
023	ISA	029	003	I will encamp against thee round about, And I will lay siege against thee with a mound, And I will raise towers against thee.
023	ISA	029	004	Thou shalt be brought down, and speak from the ground, And thy speech shall be low from the dust; Thy voice shall be like that of a spirit under ground, And thy speech shall chirp as from the dust.
023	ISA	029	005	Yet shall the multitude of thine enemies be like fine dust; The multitude of the terrible like flying chaff; It shall take place suddenly, in a moment.
023	ISA	029	006	From Jehovah of hosts cometh the visitation With thunder, and earthquake, and great noise, With storm and tempest, And flames of devouring fire.
023	ISA	029	007	As a dream, a vision of the night, Shall be the multitude of all the nations That fight against Ariel, That fight against her and her fortress, And distress her.
023	ISA	029	008	As a hungry man dreameth, and lo! he eateth, But awaketh and is still hungry; And as a thirsty man dreameth, and lo! he drinketh, But awaketh, and lo! he is faint and thirsty; So shall it be with the multitude of all the nations That fight against mount Zion.
023	ISA	029	009	Be in amazement and be amazed! Be blinded and be blind! They are drunk, but not with wine; They stagger, but not with strong drink!
023	ISA	029	010	For Jehovah hath poured upon you a spirit of slumber; He hath closed your eyes, the prophets, And covered your heads, the seers;
023	ISA	029	011	And so every vision is to you as the words of a sealed book, Which is given to a man that is skilled in writing, Saying, “Read this, I pray thee”; But he answereth, “I cannot, for it is sealed.”
023	ISA	029	012	Or, if he give it to one that is not skilled in writing, Saying, “Read this, I pray thee,” He answereth, “I am not skilled in writing.”
023	ISA	029	013	Therefore saith the Lord, Since this people draweth near to me with their mouth, And honoreth me with their lips, While their heart is far from me, And their worship of me is according to the commandments of men,
023	ISA	029	014	Therefore, behold, I will proceed to deal marvellously with this people; Marvellously and wonderfully, For the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, And the prudence of the prudent shall be hid.
023	ISA	029	015	Woe to them that hide deep their purposes from Jehovah, Whose work is in darkness; That say, Who seeth us? Who knoweth us?
023	ISA	029	016	Alas, your perverseness! Is the potter to be esteemed as the clay, That the work should say of its maker, He made me not? And the thing formed say of him that formed it, He hath no understanding?
023	ISA	029	017	Is it not yet a very little while, And Lebanon shall be changed to a fruitful field, And the fruitful field be esteemed a forest.
023	ISA	029	018	And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, And out of mist and darkness shall the eyes of the blind see.
023	ISA	029	019	The afflicted shall exceedingly rejoice in Jehovah, And the poor shall exult in the Holy One of Israel.
023	ISA	029	020	For the oppressor hath come to naught; the scoffer is destroyed; And all that watched for iniquity are cut off;
023	ISA	029	021	Who condemned a man in his cause, And laid snares for him who defended himself in the gate, And with falsehood caused the righteous to fail.
023	ISA	029	022	Therefore concerning the house of Jacob thus saith Jehovah, He that redeemed Abraham: No more shall Jacob be ashamed, And no more shall his face grow pale.
023	ISA	029	023	For when his children behold the work of my hands in the midst of them, They shall honor my name. They shall honor the Holy One of Jacob, And reverence the God of Israel.
023	ISA	029	024	They that erred in spirit shall come to understanding, And the obstinate shall receive instruction.
023	ISA	030	001	Woe to the rebellious children, saith Jehovah, Who form plans, and not from me, And make covenants without my spirit, That they may add sin to sin!
023	ISA	030	002	Who go down into Egypt, Without inquiring at my mouth, To seek refuge in Pharaoh's protection, And to trust in the shadow of Egypt!
023	ISA	030	003	The protection of Pharaoh shall be your shame; Your trust in the shadow of Egypt your confusion.
023	ISA	030	004	For their princes are at Zoan, Their ambassadors have arrived at Hanes.
023	ISA	030	005	But they are all ashamed of a people that do not profit them; That are no help and no profit, But only a shame and a reproach.
023	ISA	030	006	The loaded beasts go southward. Through a land of anguish and distress, Whence come forth the lioness, and the fierce lion, The viper, and the flying fiery serpent; On the shoulders of young asses they carry their wealth, And on the bunches of camels their treasures, To a people that will not profit them!
023	ISA	030	007	Vain and empty is the help of Egypt; Wherefore I call her, The Blusterer that sitteth still.
023	ISA	030	008	Go now, write this on a tablet before them; Note it down upon a book, That it may remain for future times, A testimony forever!
023	ISA	030	009	For this is a rebellious people, false children; Children who will not hear the law of Jehovah;
023	ISA	030	010	Who say to the seers, “See not!” And to the prophets, “Prophesy not right things; Speak to us smooth things, Prophesy falsehood!
023	ISA	030	011	Turn aside from the way, Depart from the path, Remove from our sight the Holy One of Israel!”
023	ISA	030	012	Wherefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel: Since ye despise this word, And trust in oppression and perverseness, And lean thereon,
023	ISA	030	013	Therefore shall this iniquity be to you Like a breach ready to give way, That swelleth out in a high wall, Whose fall cometh suddenly, in an instant.
023	ISA	030	014	It is broken like a potter's vessel, Which is dashed in pieces and not spared, So that among its fragments not a sherd is found to take up fire from the hearth, Or to dip water from the cistern.
023	ISA	030	015	For thus said the Lord Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel: By a return and by rest shall ye be saved; In quietness and confidence is your strength;
023	ISA	030	016	But ye would not. Ye said, “No! we will bound along upon horses”; Truly ye shall bound along in flight. “We will ride upon swift coursers”; But they shall be swift that pursue you.
023	ISA	030	017	A thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one, And ten thousand at the rebuke of five, Till what remains of you shall be as a beacon on the top of a mountain, As a banner upon a hill.
023	ISA	030	018	And yet will Jehovah wait to be gracious to you, And yet will he arise to have mercy upon you; For Jehovah is a righteous God; Happy are all they who wait for him!
023	ISA	030	019	For, O people of Zion, that dwellest in Jerusalem, Thou shalt not always weep! He will be very gracious to thee at the voice of thy cry; No sooner shall he hear it, than he will answer thee.
023	ISA	030	020	Though Jehovah hath given thee the bread of distress, and the water of affliction, Yet shall thy teachers be hidden from thee no more; But thine eyes shall see thy teachers.
023	ISA	030	021	And thine ears shall hear a voice behind thee, Saying, “This is the way, walk ye in it!” When ye turn aside to the right hand, or to the left.
023	ISA	030	022	Ye shall treat as defiled the silver coverings of your graven images, And the golden clothing of your molten images, Ye shall cast them away as an unclean thing; Away! shall ye say to them.
023	ISA	030	023	Then will he give rain for thy seed, With which thou shalt sow the ground, And the bread-corn, the produce of the land, shall be rich and nourishing; Then shall thy cattle feed in large pastures.
023	ISA	030	024	The oxen also, and the young asses, that till the ground, Shall eat well-seasoned provender, Which hath been winnowed with the shovel and the fan.
023	ISA	030	025	And on every lofty mountain, And on every high hill, Shall be brooks and streams of water, In the day of the great slaughter, When the towers fall.
023	ISA	030	026	Then shall the light of the moon be as the light of the sun, And the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, [[As the light of seven days, ]] When Jehovah bindeth up the bruises of his people, And healeth the wound which they have received.
023	ISA	030	027	Behold, the name of Jehovah cometh from afar, His anger burneth, and violent is the flame, His lips are full of indignation, And his tongue like a devouring fire.
023	ISA	030	028	His breath is like an overflowing torrent, That reacheth even to the neck; He will toss the nation with the winnowing-fan of destruction; He will put a bridle upon the jaws of the people, that shall lead them astray.
023	ISA	030	029	But ye shall then sing as in the night of a solemn festival; Your heart shall be glad, like his who marcheth with the sound of the pipe To the mountain of Jehovah, to the rock of Israel.
023	ISA	030	030	Jehovah will cause his glorious voice to be heard, And the blow of his arm to be seen, With furious anger, and flames of devouring fire; With flood, and storm, and hailstones.
023	ISA	030	031	For by the voice of Jehovah shall the Assyrian be beaten down; He will smite him with the rod.
023	ISA	030	032	And as often as the appointed rod shall strike, Which Jehovah shall lay heavily upon him, It shall be accompanied with tabrets and harps; And with fierce battles will he fight against him.
023	ISA	030	033	For long hath the burning place been prepared; Yea, for the king hath it been made ready; The pile is made deep and broad; There is fire and wood in abundance; The breath of Jehovah, like a stream of brimstone, kindle it.
023	ISA	031	001	Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help, And put their trust in horses, And confide in chariots, because they are many, And in horsemen, because their number is great, But look not to the Holy One of Israel, And resort not to Jehovah.
023	ISA	031	002	Yet he, too, is wise; He will bring evil, and not take back his words; He will arise against the house of the evil-doers, And against the help of them that do iniquity.
023	ISA	031	003	The Egyptians are men, and not God, And their horses are flesh, and not spirit. When Jehovah shall stretch forth his hand, Then shall the helper fall, and the helped be overthrown; And they shall all perish together.
023	ISA	031	004	For thus hath Jehovah said to me: As when the lion and the young lion growl over their prey, And a multitude of shepherds is called forth against him, By their noise he is not terrified, Nor by their tumult disheartened; So shall Jehovah of hosts come down to fight for mount Zion, and her hill.
023	ISA	031	005	As birds hover over their young, So shall Jehovah of hosts defend Jerusalem; He will defend and deliver, spare and save.
023	ISA	031	006	Turn, O ye children of Israel, To him from whom ye have so deeply revolted! For in that day shall every one cast away his idols of
023	ISA	031	007	silver and his idols of gold, Which your hands have made for sin.
023	ISA	031	008	The Assyrian shall fall by a sword not of man, Yea, a sword not of mortal shall devour him; He shall flee before the sword, And his young warriors shall be slaves.
023	ISA	031	009	Through fear shall he pass beyond his stronghold, And his princes shall be afraid of the standard. Thus saith Jehovah, who hath his fire in Zion, And his furnace in Jerusalem.
023	ISA	032	001	Behold! a king shall reign in righteousness, And princes shall rule with equity.
023	ISA	032	002	Every one of them shall be a hiding-place from the wind, And a shelter from the tempest; As streams of water in a dry place, As the shadow of a great rock in a weary land.
023	ISA	032	003	The eyes of them that see shall no more be blind, And the ears of them that hear shall hearken.
023	ISA	032	004	The heart of the rash shall gain wisdom, And the tongue of the stammerer learn to speak plainly.
023	ISA	032	005	The vile shall no more be called liberal, Nor the niggard said to be bountiful;
023	ISA	032	006	For the vile will still utter villany, And his heart will devise iniquity; He will practise deception, and speak impiety against God; He will take away the food of the hungry, And deprive the thirsty of drink.
023	ISA	032	007	The instruments also of the niggard are evil; He plotteth mischievous devices, To destroy the poor with lying words, Even when the cause of the needy is just.
023	ISA	032	008	But the liberal deviseth liberal things, And in liberal things will he persevere.
023	ISA	032	009	Arise, hear my voice, ye women that are at ease! Give ear to my speech, ye careless daughters!
023	ISA	032	010	One year more, and ye shall tremble, ye careless women! For the vintage shall fail; the harvest shall not come.
023	ISA	032	011	Tremble, O ye that are at ease! Be in dismay, ye careless ones! Strip you, make you bare, gird ye sackcloth upon your loins!
023	ISA	032	012	They shall smite themselves on their breasts, On account of the pleasant fields, On account of the fruitful vine.
023	ISA	032	013	Upon the land of my people shall come up thorns and briers; Yea, upon all the houses of joy in the joyous city.
023	ISA	032	014	For the palace shall be forsaken; The tumult of the city shall be solitary; The fortified hill and the tower shall be dens forever; The joy of wild-asses, the pasture of flocks;
023	ISA	032	015	Until the spirit from on high be poured upon us, And the wilderness become a fruitful field, And the fruitful field be esteemed a forest.
023	ISA	032	016	Then shall justice dwell in the wilderness, And righteousness in the fruitful field.
023	ISA	032	017	And the effect of righteousness shall be peace, And the fruit of righteousness quiet and security forever.
023	ISA	032	018	Then shall my people dwell in peaceful habitations, In secure dwellings, in quiet resting-places.
023	ISA	032	019	But the hail shall descend, and the forest shall fall; And the city shall be brought very low.
023	ISA	032	020	Happy ye who sow beside all waters; Who send forth thither the feet of the ox and the ass!
023	ISA	033	001	Woe to thee, thou spoiler, who hast not been spoiled! Thou plunderer, who hast not been plundered! When thou hast ceased to spoil, thou shalt be spoiled; When thou hast finished plundering, they shall plunder thee.
023	ISA	033	002	O Jehovah, have mercy upon us! in thee do we trust; Be thou our strength every morning, Our salvation in the time of trouble.
023	ISA	033	003	At the voice of thy thunder the people flee; When thou dost arise, the nations are scattered.
023	ISA	033	004	Your spoil shall be gathered, as the locust gathereth; As the locust runneth, so shall they run upon it.
023	ISA	033	005	Jehovah is exalted; Yea, he dwelleth on high; He filleth Zion with justice and righteousness.
023	ISA	033	006	There shall be security in thy times; Wisdom and knowledge shall be thy store of prosperity, And the fear of Jehovah, this shall be thy treasure!
023	ISA	033	007	Behold, the mighty men cry without: The ambassadors of peace weep bitterly.
023	ISA	033	008	The highways are desolate; The traveller ceaseth; He breaketh the covenant; he despiseth the cities; Of men he maketh no account.
023	ISA	033	009	The land mourneth and languisheth; Lebanon is put to shame, and withered away; Sharon is like a desert, And Bashan and Carmel are stripped of their leaves.
023	ISA	033	010	Now will I arise, saith Jehovah, Now will I exalt myself, Now will I lift myself up.
023	ISA	033	011	Ye shall conceive chaff, and bring forth stubble; Your own wrath is the fire which shall devour you.
023	ISA	033	012	The nations shall be burnt into lime; Like thorns cut down, they shall be consumed with fire.
023	ISA	033	013	Hear, ye that are far off, what I have done; Mark, ye that are near, my power!
023	ISA	033	014	The sinners in Zion are struck with dread; Terror hath seized upon the unrighteous: “Who among us can dwell in devouring fire? Who among us can dwell in everlasting flames?”
023	ISA	033	015	He that walketh in righteousness, And speaketh that which is right, That despiseth the gain of oppression, And shaketh his hands from bribery, That stoppeth his ears, so as not to hear of blood, And shutteth his eyes, so as not to behold iniquity.
023	ISA	033	016	He shall dwell on high; The strongholds of rocks shall be his defence; His bread shall be given him; His water shall not fail.
023	ISA	033	017	Thine eyes shall see the king in his glory They shall survey a wide-extended land.
023	ISA	033	018	Thy heart shall meditate on the past terror: “Where now is the scribe? Where the weigher of tribute? Where he that numbered the towers?”
023	ISA	033	019	Thou shalt see no more a fierce people, A people of a dark language, which thou couldst not hear, And of a barbarous tongue, which thou couldst not understand;
023	ISA	033	020	Thou shalt see Zion, the city of our solemn feasts; Thine eyes shall behold Jerusalem, as a quiet habitation. A tent that shall never be moved, Whose stakes shall never be taken away, And whose cords shall never be broken.
023	ISA	033	021	For there the glorious Jehovah will be to us Instead of rivers and broad streams, Which no oared galley shall pass, And no gallant ship go through.
023	ISA	033	022	For Jehovah is our judge; Jehovah is our lawgiver; Jehovah is our king; it is he that will save us.
023	ISA	033	023	Thy ropes hang loose; They cannot hold the mast-socket, Nor can they spread the sail. Then shall a great spoil be divided; Even the lame shall take the prey.
023	ISA	033	024	No inhabitant shall say, I am sick; The people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity.
023	ISA	034	001	Draw near, O ye nations, and hear! Attend, O ye people! Let the earth hear, and all that is therein; The world, and all that springs from it!
023	ISA	034	002	For the wrath of Jehovah is kindled against all the nations, And his fury against all their armies; He hath devoted them to destruction; He hath given them up to slaughter.
023	ISA	034	003	Their slain shall be cast out; From their carcasses their stench shall ascend, And the mountains shall flow down with their blood.
023	ISA	034	004	And all the hosts of heaven shall melt away; And the heavens shall be rolled up like a scroll, And all their host shall fall down, As the withered leaf faileth from the vine, As the blighted fruit from the fig-tree.
023	ISA	034	005	For my sword hath become drunk in heaven; Behold, upon Edom shall it descend, Upon the people under my curse, for vengeance.
023	ISA	034	006	The sword of Jehovah is full of blood; It is covered with fat, With the blood of lambs and goats, With the fat of the kidneys of rams; For Jehovah holdeth a sacrifice in Bozrah, And a great slaughter in the land of Edom.
023	ISA	034	007	The wild buffaloes shall fall down with them. And the bullocks with the bulls; The hind shall be drunk with blood, And the ground enriched with fat.
023	ISA	034	008	For Jehovah holdeth a day of vengeance, A year of recompense in the cause of Zion.
023	ISA	034	009	Her streams shall be turned into pitch, And her dust into brimstone, And her whole land shall become burning pitch.
023	ISA	034	010	Day and night it shall not be quenched; Its smoke shall ascend forever; From generation to generation it shall lie waste; None shall pass through it for ever and ever.
023	ISA	034	011	The pelican and the hedgehog shall possess it; The heron and the raven shall dwell in it; Over it will he draw the measuring-line of destruction. And the plummet of desolation.
023	ISA	034	012	Her nobles — none are there, who may proclaim a kingdom, And all her princes have come to naught.
023	ISA	034	013	Thorns shall spring up in her palaces; Nettles and thistles in her strongholds. She shall become a habitation for jackals, A court for ostriches.
023	ISA	034	014	The wild-cats shall fall upon the wolves, And the satyr shall call to his fellow; There also shall the night-spectre light, And find a place of rest.
023	ISA	034	015	There also shall the arrow-snake make her nest, and lay her eggs; She shall hatch them, and gather her young under her shadow: There also shall the vultures be gathered together, Every one with her mate.
023	ISA	034	016	Search ye the book of Jehovah, and read! Not one of these shall fail; Not one shall want her mate; For His mouth, it shall command, And His spirit, it shall gather them.
023	ISA	034	017	He shall cast the lot for them; His hand shall divide it for them with a line; They shall possess it forever; From generation to generation shall they dwell therein.
023	ISA	035	001	The wilderness and the parched land shall be glad, And the desert rejoice and blossom as the rose;
023	ISA	035	002	It shall blossom abundantly, and exult with joy and singing; The glory of Lebanon shall be given to it; The beauty of Carmel and Sharon; They shall behold the glory of Jehovah, The majesty of our God;
023	ISA	035	003	Strengthen ye the weak hands, And confirm the tottering knees!
023	ISA	035	004	Say ye to the faint-hearted, “Be ye strong; fear ye not; Behold your God! Vengeance cometh, the retribution of God; He will come and save you!”
023	ISA	035	005	Then shall the eyes of the blind be opened, And the ears of the deaf be unstopped.
023	ISA	035	006	Then shall the lame leap like the hart, And the tongue of the dumb shall sing; For in the wilderness shall waters break forth, And streams in the desert.
023	ISA	035	007	The glowing sands shall become a pool, And the thirsty ground springs of water; In the habitation of jackals, where they lie, Shall be a place for reeds and rushes.
023	ISA	035	008	And a path shall be there, and a highway, And it shall be called the holy way; No unclean person shall pass over it; it shall be for them alone; He that therein goeth in this way, though a fool, shall not err therein.
023	ISA	035	009	No lion shall be there, Nor shall any ravenous beast go up thereon; It shall not be found there; But the redeemed shall walk there.
023	ISA	035	010	Yea, the ransomed of Jehovah shall return; They shall come to Zion with songs: Everlasting joy shall be upon their heads; They shall obtain joy and gladness, And sorrow and sighing shall flee away.
023	ISA	036	001	In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib, king of Assyria, came up against all the fortified cities of Judah, and took them.
023	ISA	036	002	And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem, with a great army, against King Hezekiah, and he halted at the aqueduct of the upper pool, in the highway to the fuller's field.
023	ISA	036	003	Then came forth to him Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, who was over the palace, and Shebna the scribe, and Josh, the son of Asaph, the annalist.
023	ISA	036	004	And Rabshakeh said to them, Say ye to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria: What a confidence is this which thou cherishest!
023	ISA	036	005	Thou sayest, (but it is vain talk, ) “I have counsel and strength for war.” In whom, then, dost thou trust, that thou rebellest against me?
023	ISA	036	006	Behold, thou trustest in that broken reed-staff, Egypt, on which if a man lean, it will pierce his hand, and go through it. Such is Pharaoh, king of Egypt, to all that trust in him.
023	ISA	036	007	But if ye say to me, “We trust in Jehovah, our God,”—is it not he whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem to worship before this altar?
023	ISA	036	008	Engage, now, with my master, the king of Assyria! and I will give thee two thousand horses, when thou art able to provide for thyself riders for them.
023	ISA	036	009	How, then, canst thou resist a single captain, one of the least of the servants of my master? Yet thou trustest in Egypt, on account of her chariots and her horsemen.
023	ISA	036	010	And am I now come up without Jehovah against this land to destroy it? Jehovah hath said to me, “Go up against this land and destroy it!”
023	ISA	036	011	Then said Eliakim and Shebna and Josh to Rabshakeh: Speak, we beseech thee, to thy servants in the Aramaic language, for we understand it; and speak not to us in the Jewish language, in the hearing of the people that are upon the wall.
023	ISA	036	012	But Rabshakeh said, Hath my master sent me to speak these words to thy master and to thee only, and not to the people who sit upon the wall, to eat their own dung, and to drink their own urine with you?
023	ISA	036	013	Then Rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jewish language, and said, Hear ye the words of the great king, the king of Assyria.
023	ISA	036	014	Thus saith the king: Let not Hezekiah deceive you, for he will not be able to deliver you.
023	ISA	036	015	And let not Hezekiah persuade you to trust in Jehovah, saying, “Jehovah will certainly deliver us. This city shall not be delivered into the hands of the king of Assyria.”
023	ISA	036	016	Hearken not to Hezekiah; for thus saith the king of Assyria: Make peace with me, and come out to me; and ye shall every one eat of his own vine, and every one of his own fig-tree, and ye shall every one drink the waters of his own cistern,
023	ISA	036	017	until I come, and take you to a land like your own land; a land of corn, and of new wine, a land of bread and of vineyards.
023	ISA	036	018	Be not persuaded by Hezekiah, when he saith, “Jehovah will deliver us.” Have the gods of the nations delivered every one his own land from the hand of the king of Assyria? Where are the gods of Hamath and of Arphad?
023	ISA	036	019	Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? And did the gods deliver Samaria from my hand?
023	ISA	036	020	Who is there among all the gods of these lands, that hath delivered his land out of my hand, that Jehovah should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?
023	ISA	036	021	But the people held their peace, and answered him not a word; for the king's command was, “Answer him not.”
023	ISA	036	022	Then came Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, that was over the palace, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the annalist, to Hezekiah, with their clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.
023	ISA	037	001	And when the king, Hezekiah, heard it, he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of Jehovah.
023	ISA	037	002	And he sent Eliakim, who was over the palace, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz.
023	ISA	037	003	And they said to him, Thus saith Hezekiah: This day is a day of distress, of rebuke, and of contempt; for the children have come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.
023	ISA	037	004	It may be that Jehovah, thy God, will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria, his master, hath sent to reproach the living God, and to revile him with the words which Jehovah, thy God, hath heard. Do thou, therefore, lift up thy prayer for the remnant of the people, that is yet left.
023	ISA	037	005	And the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
023	ISA	037	006	And Isaiah said to them, Thus shall ye say to your master: Thus saith Jehovah: Be not afraid on account of the words which thou hast heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.
023	ISA	037	007	Behold, I will put a spirit within him, so that he shall hear a rumor, and return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.
023	ISA	037	008	Then Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah, for he had heard that he had departed from Lachish.
023	ISA	037	009	Then he heard concerning Tirhakah, king of Ethiopia, that it was said, “He is come forth to war against thee.” And when he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah and said,
023	ISA	037	010	Thus shall ye say to Hezekiah, the king of Judah: Let not thy God, in whom thou trustest, deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.
023	ISA	037	011	Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the lands; how they have utterly destroyed them. And shalt thou be delivered?
023	ISA	037	012	Did the gods of the nations which my father destroyed, deliver them? Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden in Telassar?
023	ISA	037	013	Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arphad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Henah, and of Ivah?
023	ISA	037	014	And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it. Then he went up to the house of Jehovah, and spread it before Jehovah.
023	ISA	037	015	And Hezekiah prayed before Jehovah, saying,
023	ISA	037	016	O Jehovah of hosts, God of Israel, who sittest between the cherubs, thou alone art the God of all the kingdoms of the earth; thou hast made heaven and earth.
023	ISA	037	017	Incline thine ear, O Jehovah, and hear; open thine eyes, O Jehovah, and see; and hear all the words of Sennacherib, which he hath sent to reproach the living God.
023	ISA	037	018	In truth, O Jehovah, the kings of Assyria have destroyed all the nations, and their lands,
023	ISA	037	019	and have cast their gods into the fire; for they were not gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone; and they have destroyed them.
023	ISA	037	020	But do thou, O Jehovah, our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou alone art Jehovah.
023	ISA	037	021	Then Isaiah, the son of Amoz, sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: Whereas thou hast prayed to me on account of Sennacherib, the king of Assyria,
023	ISA	037	022	This is the word which Jehovah hath spoken against him. The virgin, the daughter of Zion, despiseth thee; she laugheth thee to scorn; The daughter of Jerusalem shaketh her head after thee.
023	ISA	037	023	Whom hast thou reproached, and reviled, And against whom hast thou exalted thy voice, And lifted up thine eyes on high? Against the Holy One of Israel.
023	ISA	037	024	By thy servants hast thou reproached the Lord, and said: “With the multitude of my chariots have I ascended the heights of the mountains, the extremities of Lebanon; I have cut down its tall cedars, and its choice cypress-trees; I have come to its utmost height, to its garden forest.
023	ISA	037	025	I have digged and drunk water, And with the sole of my feet will I dry up all the rivers of Egypt.”
023	ISA	037	026	Hast thou not heard, that of old I ordained it, And from ancient times purposed it? Now have I brought it to pass, That thou shouldst convert fortified cities into ruinous heaps.
023	ISA	037	027	Therefore were their inhabitants of little strength; They were dismayed and confounded; They were as the grass of the field, and the green herb; As grass upon the house-top, and as corn blasted, before it is grown up.
023	ISA	037	028	I know thy sitting down, thy going out, and thy coming in, And thy rage against me.
023	ISA	037	029	Because thy rage against me, and thy insolence, is come up into my ears, I will put my ring into thy nose, And my bridle into thy lips, And turn thee back by the way in which thou camest.
023	ISA	037	030	And this shall be the sign to thee; Eat this year that which groweth of itself, And in the second year that which groweth of itself, And in the third year ye shall sow and reap, And plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof.
023	ISA	037	031	And the remnant of the house of Judah, that have escaped, Shall again strike root downward, And bear fruit upward.
023	ISA	037	032	For from Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, And they that have escaped from mount Zion. The zeal of Jehovah of hosts will perform this.
023	ISA	037	033	Therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts concerning the king of Assyria; He shall not come into this city, Nor shoot an arrow into it; He shall not present a shield before it, Nor cast up a mound against it.
023	ISA	037	034	By the way in which he came, by the same shall he return, And into this city shall he not come, saith Jehovah.
023	ISA	037	035	For I will defend this city, and deliver it, For mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake.
023	ISA	037	036	Then an angel of Jehovah went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and eighty-five thousand men; and when the people arose early in the morning, behold they were all dead corpses.
023	ISA	037	037	Then Sennacherib, king of Assyria, decamped, and went away, and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.
023	ISA	037	038	And as he was worshipping in the temple of Nisroch, his god, he was slain with the sword by his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer, who escaped into the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon, his son, reigned in his stead.
023	ISA	038	001	In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death; and Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, came to him, and said to him, Set thy house in order, for thou shalt die, and not live.
023	ISA	038	002	Then Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall, and made his supplication to Jehovah.
023	ISA	038	003	And he said, I beseech thee, O Jehovah, remember now how I have walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thine eyes! And Hezekiah wept bitterly.
023	ISA	038	004	Then came the word of Jehovah to Isaiah,
023	ISA	038	005	Go in and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of David thy father: I have heard thy prayer; I have seen thy tears. Behold, I will add to thy life fifteen years.
023	ISA	038	006	And I will deliver thee and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria, and I will defend this city.
023	ISA	038	007	And this shall be the sign to thee from Jehovah, that Jehovah will do that which he hath spoken.
023	ISA	038	008	Behold, I will cause the shadow upon the dial, which hath gone down upon the dial of Ahaz with the sun, to go back ten degrees. So the sun went back ten degrees, which degrees it had gone down.
023	ISA	038	009	The writing of Hezekiah, king of Judah, when he had been sick, and had recovered from his sickness.
023	ISA	038	010	I said: “Now, in the quiet of my days, shall I go down to the gates of the under-world; I am deprived of the residue of my years.”
023	ISA	038	011	I said: “No more shall I see Jehovah, Jehovah in the land of the living. I shall behold man no more Among the inhabitants of stillness.
023	ISA	038	012	My habitation is torn away and removed from me, Like a shepherd's tent; My life is rolled up as by the weaver; He cutteth me off from the thrum; Between morning and night wilt thou make an end of me!”
023	ISA	038	013	I waited till morning, and like a lion Did he crush all my bones; “Between morning and night wilt thou make an end of me!”
023	ISA	038	014	Like a swallow or a crane, so did I twitter; I did mourn as a dove; Mine eyes failed with looking upward; “O Lord, I am in distress; O, deliver me!”
023	ISA	038	015	What shall I say? He promised it, and he hath done it; I will walk humbly all my life On account of the bitterness of my soul.
023	ISA	038	016	Lord, it is thus that men live; From thee alone cometh the life of my spirit; Thou hast restored me, and caused me to live.
023	ISA	038	017	Behold, my anguish is changed into ease; In love thou hast delivered me from the pit of destruction; Thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back.
023	ISA	038	018	For the under-world cannot praise thee; The realms of death cannot celebrate thee; They that go down to the pit cannot wait for thy faithfulness.
023	ISA	038	019	The living, the living praise thee, as I do this day; The father to the children shall make known thy faithfulness.
023	ISA	038	020	Jehovah hath saved me; Therefore will we sing our songs with stringed instruments, All the days of our life, In the house of Jehovah.
023	ISA	038	021	Now Isaiah had said, let them take a lump of figs, and bruise them, and lay them upon the ulcer, and he shall recover.
023	ISA	038	022	Hezekiah also had said, What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of Jehovah?
023	ISA	039	001	At that time Merodach Baladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent a letter and a present to Hezekiah, for he had heard that he had been sick and was recovered.
023	ISA	039	002	And Hezekiah was delighted with them, and showed the embassy his treasure-house, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious oil, and his whole armory, and all that was found in his treasures. There was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, which Hezekiah did not show them.
023	ISA	039	003	Then came Isaiah the prophet to King Hezekiah, and said to him, What did these men say, and whence did they come to thee? And Hezekiah said, They came to me from a distant country, from Babylon.
023	ISA	039	004	Then said he, What have they seen in thy house? And Hezekiah answered: All that is in my house have they seen. There is nothing in my treasures which I have not shown them.
023	ISA	039	005	Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah, hear the word of Jehovah of hosts,
023	ISA	039	006	Behold, the days shall come, when all that is in thy house, and that thy fathers have treasured up to this day, shall be carried away to Babylon. Nothing shall be left, saith Jehovah.
023	ISA	039	007	And of thy sons, which shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget, shall they take away, and they shall he eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.
023	ISA	039	008	Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah, Good is the word of Jehovah, which thou hast spoken. For, said he, there shall be peace and security in my days.
023	ISA	040	001	Comfort ye, comfort ye, my people, Saith your God.
023	ISA	040	002	Speak ye encouragement to Jerusalem, and declare to her, That her hard service is ended; That her iniquity is expiated; That she hath received from the hand of Jehovah Double for all her sins.
023	ISA	040	003	A voice crieth: “Prepare ye in the wilderness the way of Jehovah; Make straight in the desert a highway for our God!
023	ISA	040	004	Every valley shall be exalted, And every mountain and hill be made low; The crooked shall become straight, And the rough places plain.
023	ISA	040	005	For the glory of Jehovah shall be revealed, And all flesh shall see it together; For the mouth of Jehovah hath spoken it!”
023	ISA	040	006	A voice said, Proclaim! And I said, What shall I proclaim? All flesh is grass, And all its comeliness as the flower of the field.
023	ISA	040	007	The grass withereth, the flower fadeth, When the breath of Jehovah bloweth upon it. Truly the people is grass.
023	ISA	040	008	The grass withereth, the flower fadeth, But the word of our God shall stand forever.
023	ISA	040	009	Get thee up on the high mountain, O thou that bringest glad tidings to Zion; Lift up thy voice with strength, thou that bringest glad tidings to Jerusalem; Lift it up; be not afraid; Say to the cities of Judah, Behold your God!
023	ISA	040	010	Behold, the Lord Jehovah shall come with might, And his arm shall rule for him; Behold, his reward is with him, And his recompense before him.
023	ISA	040	011	He shall feed his flock like a shepherd; He shall gather up the lambs in his arms, And carry them in his bosom, And gently lead the nursing ewes.
023	ISA	040	012	Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, And meted out the heavens with his span, And gathered the dust of the earth into a measure, And weighed the mountains in scales, And the hills in a balance?
023	ISA	040	013	Who hath searched out the spirit of Jehovah, Or, being his counsellor, hath taught him?
023	ISA	040	014	With whom took he counsel, and who instructed him, And taught him the path of justice, And taught him knowledge, And showed him the way of understanding?
023	ISA	040	015	Behold, the nations are as a drop from a bucket, And are accounted as the small dust of the balance; Behold, he taketh up the isles as a very little thing,
023	ISA	040	016	And Lebanon is not sufficient for fire, Nor its beasts for a burnt-offering.
023	ISA	040	017	All the nations are as nothing before him; They are accounted by him as less than nothing, and vanity.
023	ISA	040	018	To whom then will ye liken God, And what likeness will ye compare unto him?
023	ISA	040	019	The workman casteth an image, And the smith overlayeth it with gold, And casteth for it silver chains.
023	ISA	040	020	He that is too poor to make an oblation Chooseth a piece of wood that will not rot; He seeketh for himself a skilful artificer, To prepare an image that shall not be moved.
023	ISA	040	021	Do ye not know? Have ye not heard? Hath it not been declared to you from the beginning? Have ye not considered the foundations of the earth?
023	ISA	040	022	It is He that sitteth above the circle of the earth, And the inhabitants are to him as grasshoppers; That stretcheth out the heavens as a canopy, And spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in;
023	ISA	040	023	That bringeth princes to nothing, And reduceth the rulers of the earth to vanity.
023	ISA	040	024	Yea, scarcely are they planted, scarcely are they sown, Scarcely hath their stem taken root in the ground, When He bloweth upon them and they wither, And the whirlwind beareth them away like stubble.
023	ISA	040	025	To whom then will ye liken me, And to whom shall I be compared? Saith the Holy One.
023	ISA	040	026	Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and behold! Who hath created these? He draweth forth their host by number, He calleth them all by name; Through the greatness of his strength and the mightiness of his power, Not one of them faileth to appear.
023	ISA	040	027	Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest, O Israel, “My way is hidden from Jehovah, My cause passeth by before my God”?
023	ISA	040	028	Do ye not know? Have ye not heard? Jehovah is an everlasting God, The creator of the ends of the earth; He fainteth not, nor is he weary; His understanding is unsearchable.
023	ISA	040	029	He giveth power to the faint; To the feeble abundant strength.
023	ISA	040	030	The youths shall faint and be weary, And the young warriors shall utterly fall.
023	ISA	040	031	But they that trust in Jehovah shall renew their strength; They shall mount up with wings like eagles; They shall run and not be weary; They shall walk and not faint.
023	ISA	041	001	Keep silence, and hear me, ye distant lands. Ye nations, gather your strength! Let them come near; then let them speak; Let us go together into judgment.
023	ISA	041	002	Who hath raised up from the region of the East Him whom victory meeteth in his march? Who hath subdued nations before him, And given him dominion over kings? Who made their swords like dust, And their bows like driven stubble?
023	ISA	041	003	He pursued them, and passed in safety, By a path which his foot had never trodden.
023	ISA	041	004	Who hath wrought and done it? I, who have called the generations from the beginning, I, Jehovah, the first; And with the last also am I.
023	ISA	041	005	Distant nations saw it, and were afraid; The ends of the earth, and trembled; They drew near, and came together.
023	ISA	041	006	One helped another, And said to him, “Be of good courage!”
023	ISA	041	007	The carpenter encouraged the smith, He that smoothed with the hammer him that smote on the anvil, And said, “The soldering is good,” And he fastened it with nails that it might not fall.
023	ISA	041	008	But thou, O Israel, my servant, Thou, Jacob, whom I have chosen, Offspring of Abraham, my friend!
023	ISA	041	009	Thou, whom I have led by the hand from the ends of the earth, And called from the extremities thereof, And said to thee, “Thou art my servant, I have chosen thee, and not cast thee away!”
023	ISA	041	010	Fear not, for I am with thee; Faint not, for I, thy God, will strengthen thee; I will help thee, and sustain thee, with my right hand of salvation!
023	ISA	041	011	Behold, all who are enraged against thee Shall be ashamed and confounded; All that contend with thee Shall come to nothing and perish.
023	ISA	041	012	Thou shalt seek and not find Them that contend with thee; They shall come to nothing, and be no more, Who make war against thee.
023	ISA	041	013	For I, Jehovah, am thy God, that holdeth thee by the right hand, That saith to thee, “Fear not, I am thy helper!”
023	ISA	041	014	Fear not, thou worm Jacob, thou feeble people of Israel! I am thy helper, saith Jehovah; Thy redeemer is the Holy One of Israel.
023	ISA	041	015	Behold, I will make thee a thrashing-wain, sharp and new, With double edges; Thou shalt thrash the mountains, and beat them small, And make the hills as chaff.
023	ISA	041	016	Thou shalt winnow them, and the wind shall carry them away, And the whirlwind shall scatter them. But thou shalt rejoice in Jehovah, And glory in the Holy One of Israel.
023	ISA	041	017	When the poor and needy seek water, and there is none, And their tongue is parched with thirst, I, Jehovah, will hear them; I, the God of Israel, will not forsake them.
023	ISA	041	018	I will open rivers upon the bare hills, And fountains in the midst of the valleys; I will make the wilderness a pool of water, And the dry land springs of water.
023	ISA	041	019	I will plant in the wilderness the cedar and the acacia, The myrtle and the olive-tree; I will place in the desert the cypress, The plane-tree and the larch together.
023	ISA	041	020	That they may see, and know, And consider, and understand together, That the hand of Jehovah hath done this, And that the Holy One of Israel hath created it.
023	ISA	041	021	Bring forward your cause, saith Jehovah; Produce your strong reasons, saith the king of Jacob.
023	ISA	041	022	Let them produce them, and show us what shall happen! Tell us what ye have predicted in times past, That we may consider, and know its fulfilment! Or declare to us things that are to come!
023	ISA	041	023	Let us hear what shall happen in future times, That we may know whether ye are gods; Do something, be it good or evil, That we may be astonished, and see it together!
023	ISA	041	024	Behold, ye are less than nothing, And your work is less than naught; An abomination is he that chooseth you!
023	ISA	041	025	I have raised up one from the north, and he cometh; From the rising of the sun he calleth upon my name; He trampleth upon princes as upon mortar; As the potter treadeth down the clay.
023	ISA	041	026	Who hath declared this from the beginning, that we might know it, And long ago, that we might say, It is true? There was not one that foretold it, not one that declared it, Not one that heard your words.
023	ISA	041	027	I first said to Zion, Behold! behold them! And I gave to Jerusalem a messenger of glad tidings.
023	ISA	041	028	I looked, but there was no man; Even among them, but there was none that gave counsel; I inquired of them that they might give an answer;
023	ISA	041	029	But behold, they are all vanity; Their works are nothing; Wind and emptiness are their molten images.
023	ISA	042	001	Behold my servant, whom I uphold, My chosen, in whom my soul delighteth, I have put my spirit upon him; He shall cause law to go forth to the nations.
023	ISA	042	002	He shall not cry aloud, nor lift up his voice, Nor cause it to be heard in the street.
023	ISA	042	003	The bruised reed shall he not break, And the glimmering flax shall he not quench; He shall send forth law according to truth.
023	ISA	042	004	He shall not fail, nor become weary, Until he shall have established justice in the earth. And distant nations shall wait for his law.
023	ISA	042	005	Thus saith God Jehovah, Who created the heavens and stretched them out, Who spread forth the earth, and that which springeth forth from it, Who gave breath to the people upon it, And spirit to them that walk thereon:
023	ISA	042	006	I, Jehovah, have called thee for salvation; I will hold thee by the hand; I will defend thee, and make thee a covenant to the people, A light to the nations;
023	ISA	042	007	To open the blind eyes, To bring out the prisoners from the prison, And them that sit in darkness out of the prison-house.
023	ISA	042	008	I am Jehovah, that is my name; And my glory will I not give to another, Nor my praise to graven images.
023	ISA	042	009	The former things, behold! they are come to pass, And new things do I now declare; Before they spring forth, I make them known to you.
023	ISA	042	010	Sing to Jehovah a new song; His praise to the ends of the earth; Ye that go down upon the sea, and all that fill it; Ye distant coasts, and ye that dwell therein!
023	ISA	042	011	Let the desert cry aloud, and the cities thereof; The villages, that Kedar inhabiteth; Let the inhabitants of the rock sing; Let them shout from the top of the mountains!
023	ISA	042	012	Let them give glory to Jehovah, And proclaim his praise in distant lands!
023	ISA	042	013	Jehovah shall march forth like a hero; Like a mighty warrior shall he rouse his indignation, He shall cry aloud; he shall shout the war-cry, And show himself mighty against his enemies.
023	ISA	042	014	“I have long held my peace; I have been still and refrained myself; But now will I cry like a woman in travail; I will destroy and swallow up at once.
023	ISA	042	015	I will lay waste mountains and hills, And dry up all their herbs. I will make the river solid land, And dry up the pools of water.
023	ISA	042	016	Then will I lead the blind in a way which they know not, And in unknown paths will I guide them; I will make darkness light before them, And crooked paths straight; These things will I do for them, and not forsake them.”
023	ISA	042	017	Then shall they be turned back, and be put to shame, Who trust in graven images; Who say to molten images, “Ye are our gods!”
023	ISA	042	018	Hear, O ye deaf! And look, ye blind, and see!
023	ISA	042	019	Who is blind, if not my servant? And who so deaf as my messenger, whom I send? Who so blind as the friend of God, So blind as the servant of Jehovah?
023	ISA	042	020	Thou seest many things, but regardest them not; Thou hast thine ears open, but hearest not!
023	ISA	042	021	It pleased Jehovah for his goodness' sake To give him a law, great and glorious;
023	ISA	042	022	And yet it is a robbed and plundered people; They are all of them bound in prisons, And hid in dungeons; They have become a spoil, and none delivereth; A prey, and none saith, “Restore!”
023	ISA	042	023	Who is there among you that will give ear to this, That will listen and attend for the time to come?
023	ISA	042	024	Who gave Jacob to be a spoil, And Israel to plunderers? Was it not Jehovah, against whom we sinned, In whose ways we would not walk, And whose laws we would not obey?
023	ISA	042	025	Therefore hath he poured out upon Israel the fury of his wrath, and the violence of war; It kindled a flame around about him, yet he did not regard it; It set him on fire, yet he laid it not to heart.
023	ISA	043	001	But now thus saith Jehovah, that created thee, O Jacob, That formed thee, O Israel: Fear not, for I have redeemed thee; I have called thee by name; thou art mine!
023	ISA	043	002	When thou passest through waters, I will be with thee; And through rivers, they shall not overflow thee; When thou walkest through fire, thou shalt not be burned, And the flame shall not consume thee.
023	ISA	043	003	For I am Jehovah, thy God, The Holy One of Israel, thy saviour. I will give Egypt for thy ransom, Ethiopia and Seba for thee;
023	ISA	043	004	Because thou art precious in my sight, Because thou art honored, and I love thee, Therefore will I give men for thee, And nations for thy life.
023	ISA	043	005	Fear not, for I am with thee! I will bring thy children from the East, And gather thee from the West.
023	ISA	043	006	I will say to the North, “Give them up!” And to the South, “Withhold them not! Bring my sons from afar, And my daughters from the ends of the earth;
023	ISA	043	007	Every one that is called by my name, That I have created for my glory, That I have formed and made!”
023	ISA	043	008	Bring forth the blind people, having eyes, And the deaf, having ears.
023	ISA	043	009	Let all the nations be gathered together, And the kingdoms be assembled! Who among them hath declared this, And can show us former predictions? Let them produce their witnesses that they are right; That men may hear, and say, It is true!
023	ISA	043	010	Ye are my witnesses, saith Jehovah, And my servant whom I have chosen, That ye may know and believe me, And understand that I am He. Before me was no god formed, And after me there shall be none.
023	ISA	043	011	I, I am Jehovah, And besides me there is no saviour.
023	ISA	043	012	I have declared and have saved; I made it known, when there was no strange god among you; Ye are my witnesses, saith Jehovah, That I am God.
023	ISA	043	013	Even from the beginning of time I have been He, And none can rescue from my hand; I undertake, and who can hinder?
023	ISA	043	014	Thus saith Jehovah, Your redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; For your sakes have I sent to Babylon, And caused all her fugitives, And the Chaldeans, to descend to the ships of their delight.
023	ISA	043	015	I, Jehovah, am your Holy One, The creator of Israel, your king.
023	ISA	043	016	Thus saith Jehovah, —He that made a way in the sea, And a path in the mighty waters,
023	ISA	043	017	That caused the chariot and the horse, the army and the forces, to march forth; There they lay down together; they rose no more; They were extinguished; they were quenched like a torch; —
023	ISA	043	018	Remember not the former things; The things of old regard no more!
023	ISA	043	019	Behold, I do a new thing; Now shall it spring forth; yea, ye shall see it. Behold, I make a way in the wilderness, And streams in the desert;
023	ISA	043	020	The beasts of the forest shall honor me, The jackals and the ostriches; For I make rivers in the wilderness And streams in the desert, To give drink to my people, my chosen.
023	ISA	043	021	This people, which I have formed for myself Shall make known my praise.
023	ISA	043	022	Yet thou hast not called upon me, O Jacob, So as to have wearied thyself for me, O Israel!
023	ISA	043	023	Thou hast not brought me thy lambs for a burnt-offering, Nor honored me with thy sacrifices; I have not burdened thee with oblations, Nor wearied thee with incense;
023	ISA	043	024	Thou hast bought me no sweet-smelling reed with silver, Neither hast thou satisfied me with the fat of thy sacrifices; With thy sins hast thou burdened me, And wearied me with thine iniquities.
023	ISA	043	025	I, I myself, blot out thy transgressions for my own sake, And will not remember thy sins.
023	ISA	043	026	Put me in remembrance; let us plead together; Speak that thou mayst justify thyself.
023	ISA	043	027	Thy forefathers sinned, And thy teachers were rebellious against me;
023	ISA	043	028	Therefore have I profaned the princes of the sanctuary, And given up Jacob to a curse, And Israel to reproach.
023	ISA	044	001	Yet now hear, O Jacob, my servant, And Israel, whom I have chosen;
023	ISA	044	002	Thus saith Jehovah, thy Creator, He that formed thee, and hath helped thee from thy birth, Fear not, O Jacob, my servant, O Jeshurun, whom I have chosen.
023	ISA	044	003	For I will pour water upon the thirsty land, And streams upon the dry ground. I will pour out my spirit on thy children, And my blessing on thine offspring;
023	ISA	044	004	And they shall grow up, as among grass; As willows by the water-brooks.
023	ISA	044	005	One shall say, “I belong to Jehovah”; Another shall call upon the name of Jacob; Another shall write upon his hand, Jehovah's! And praise the name of Israel.
023	ISA	044	006	Thus saith Jehovah, the King of Israel, His redeemer, Jehovah of hosts: I am the first, and I the last, And besides me there is no God.
023	ISA	044	007	Who like me hath proclaimed the future, —Let him declare it, and set it in order before me!— Since I established the people of old? Let them make known the future, even that which is to come!
023	ISA	044	008	Fear ye not, neither be ye afraid! Have I not declared and made it known to you of old? Ye are my witnesses; Is there a God beside me? Yea, there is no other rock; I know not any.
023	ISA	044	009	They that make a graven image are all of them vanity, And their valued works are profitable for nothing; They are their own witnesses; They neither see nor understand, So that they may be ashamed.
023	ISA	044	010	Who hath formed a god, And cast a graven image, that is profitable for nothing?
023	ISA	044	011	Behold, all his fellows shall be ashamed; The workmen are themselves mortal men; They shall all be assembled; they shall stand up; They shall tremble, and be put to shame together!
023	ISA	044	012	The smith prepareth an axe in the coals, And fashioneth it with hammers, And worketh it with his strong arm; He becometh hungry, and his strength faileth; He drinketh no water, and is faint.
023	ISA	044	013	The carpenter stretcheth out the line; He marketh out the form of it with the sharp tool; He formeth it with planes; He marketh it with the compass; He maketh it in the figure of a man, With the beauty of a man, To dwell in a house.
023	ISA	044	014	He heweth him down cedars; He taketh the ilex and the oak; He chooseth for himself among the trees of the forest; He planteth the ash, and the rain matureth it;
023	ISA	044	015	These are fuel for man; He taketh thereof and warmeth himself; He kindleth with it, and baketh bread; A god also he formeth of it, and worshippeth it; A graven image, and falleth down before it.
023	ISA	044	016	Half of it he burneth with fire; With half of it he eateth flesh; He roasteth meat, and satisfieth himself; He also warmeth himself, and saith, Aha! I am warm; I feel the fire.
023	ISA	044	017	Of the residue he maketh a god, even his graven image; He falleth down before it and worshippeth it, And prayeth to it, and saith, “Deliver me, for thou art my God!”
023	ISA	044	018	They know not, neither understand; For their eyes are closed up, that they cannot see, And their hearts, that they cannot understand.
023	ISA	044	019	None considereth in his mind, Or hath knowledge and understanding to say: “Half of it I have burned with fire; I have also baked bread on the coals of it; I have roasted flesh and have eaten; And shall I make the remnant an abomination? Shall I fall down before the stock of a tree?”
023	ISA	044	020	He toileth for ashes; A deluded heart turneth him aside, So that he cannot deliver himself, and say “Is there not a lie in my right hand?”
023	ISA	044	021	Remember these things, O Jacob, O Israel, for thou art my servant! I formed thee; thou art my servant; O Israel, I will not forget thee.
023	ISA	044	022	I have caused thy transgressions to vanish like a cloud, And thy sins like a mist; Return to me, for I have redeemed thee!
023	ISA	044	023	Sing, O ye heavens, for Jehovah hath done it; Shout, O ye depths of the earth! Break forth into song, ye mountains! Thou forest, and every tree therein! For Jehovah hath redeemed Jacob, And glorified himself in Israel.
023	ISA	044	024	Thus saith Jehovah, thy Redeemer, Even he that formed thee from the womb; I am Jehovah, who made all things; Who stretched out the heavens alone; Who spread out the earth by myself;
023	ISA	044	025	Who frustrateth the signs of deceivers, And maketh the diviners mad; Who putteth the wise men to shame, And maketh their knowledge folly;
023	ISA	044	026	Who establisheth the word of his servant, And performeth the purpose of his messengers; Who saith of Jerusalem, “She shall be inhabited,” And of the cities of Judah, “They shall be built,” And, “Her desolated places I will restore.”
023	ISA	044	027	Who saith to the deep, “Be dry! I will dry up thy streams!”
023	ISA	044	028	Who saith of Cyrus, “He is my shepherd; He shall perform all my pleasure”; Who saith of Jerusalem, “She shall be built,” And of the temple, “Her foundation shall be laid.”
023	ISA	045	001	Thus saith Jehovah to his anointed, To Cyrus, whom I hold by his right hand, To subdue nations before him, And ungird the loins of kings; To open before him the two-leaved gates, And the doors shall not be shut.
023	ISA	045	002	I will go before thee, And make the high places plain; I will break in pieces the gates of brass, And cut in sunder the bars of iron.
023	ISA	045	003	I will give thee the treasures of darkness, And hidden riches of secret places, That thou mayst know that I am Jehovah Who calleth thee by name, the God of Israel.
023	ISA	045	004	For the sake of Jacob, my servant, And Israel, my chosen, I have called thee by thy name; I have spoken to thee as a friend, though thou hast not known me.
023	ISA	045	005	I am Jehovah, and none else; There is no God besides me; I have girded thee, though thou hast not known me.
023	ISA	045	006	That men may know from the rising of the sun, And from the West, that there is none besides me; I am Jehovah, and none else.
023	ISA	045	007	I form the light, and create darkness; I make peace, and create evil; I, Jehovah, do all these things.
023	ISA	045	008	Pour forth, ye heavens, from above; Ye clouds, shower down prosperity! Let the earth open, and bring forth salvation; Yea, let righteousness spring up together! I, Jehovah, create it.
023	ISA	045	009	Woe to him that contendeth with his Maker! A potsherd of the potsherds of the earth! Shall the clay say to him that fashioneth it, What makest thou? Or thy work say of thee, He hath no hands?
023	ISA	045	010	Woe to him that saith to his father, Why dost thou beget? Or to his mother, Why dost thou bring forth?
023	ISA	045	011	Thus saith Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, and his Maker, Ask of me concerning things to come; My children, the work of my hands, leave them to me!
023	ISA	045	012	I made the earth, And created man upon it; My hands spread out the heavens, And all their host did I arrange.
023	ISA	045	013	I have raised him up for salvation, And I will make all his ways plain; He shall build my city, and release my captives, Not for price, and not for ransom, Saith Jehovah of hosts.
023	ISA	045	014	Thus saith Jehovah: The wealth of Egypt and the merchandise of the Ethiopians and Sabeans, men of stature, Shall come over to thee, and be thine; They shall follow thee; in chains shall they pass along; They shall fall down to thee, and make supplication to thee: “In thee alone is God, and there is none else; There is no other God.”
023	ISA	045	015	Truly thou art a God that hidest thyself, O God of Israel, the saviour!
023	ISA	045	016	They shall all be ashamed and confounded, They shall go to confusion together, That are makers of idols.
023	ISA	045	017	But Israel shall be saved by Jehovah with an everlasting salvation; Ye shall never be ashamed, nor confounded.
023	ISA	045	018	For thus saith Jehovah, who created the heavens; The God that formed the earth and made it; he that made it firm; He created it not in vain; he formed it to be inhabited: I am Jehovah, and none else.
023	ISA	045	019	I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth; I have not said to the race of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain! I, Jehovah, speak truth; I declare that which is right.
023	ISA	045	020	Assemble yourselves and come; Gather yourselves together, ye that are escaped of the nations! They are without understanding, who carry about with them the wood of their graven image, And pray to a god that cannot save.
023	ISA	045	021	Proclaim ye, and bring them near, And let them take counsel together: Who hath made this known from ancient time? Who hath declared it of old? Is it not I, Jehovah, besides whom there is no God? A God that uttereth truth, and giveth salvation; there is none besides me.
023	ISA	045	022	Look to me, and be saved, all ye ends of the earth! For I am God, and there is none else.
023	ISA	045	023	By myself have I sworn, The truth hath gone from my mouth, The word, that shall not return, That to me every knee shall bow, That to me every tongue shall swear.
023	ISA	045	024	“Only in Jehovah,” shall men say, “Is salvation and strength; To him shall come and be put to shame, All that are incensed against him.”
023	ISA	045	025	Through Jehovah shall all the race of Israel be delivered, And in him shall they glory.
023	ISA	046	001	Bel sinketh down; Nebo falleth; Their images are laid upon beasts and cattle; Those that ye once bore are packed upon them; A burden to the weary beast!
023	ISA	046	002	They sink down; they fall together; They cannot rescue the burden; They themselves go into captivity.
023	ISA	046	003	Hearken to me, O house of Jacob, And all the remnant of the house of Israel; Ye that have been borne by me from your birth, That have been carried by me from your earliest breath!
023	ISA	046	004	Even to your old age I am the same; Even to hoar hairs I will carry you; I have done it, and I will still bear you; I will carry, and will deliver you.
023	ISA	046	005	To whom will ye liken me, and compare me? Yea, to whom will ye compare me, that we may be like?
023	ISA	046	006	They lavish gold out of the bag, And weigh silver in the balance; They hire a goldsmith, and he maketh it a god; They fall down, yea, they worship it.
023	ISA	046	007	They lift him upon the shoulder, and carry him; They set him in his place, and there he standeth; From his place he moveth not; Yea, one may cry to him, yet doth he not answer, Nor save him out of his distress.
023	ISA	046	008	Remember these things, and show yourselves men; Lay them to heart, ye apostates!
023	ISA	046	009	Remember the former things in ancient times! For I am God, and there is none else; I am God, and there is none like me.
023	ISA	046	010	Declaring the end from the beginning; From ancient times the things that were not yet done; Saying, My purpose shall stand, And I will do all my pleasure;
023	ISA	046	011	Calling from the East the eagle, The man that executeth my purpose from a far country; I have spoken it, I will also bring it to pass; I have purposed it, I will also do it.
023	ISA	046	012	Hearken to me, ye stubborn-hearted, That are far from deliverance!
023	ISA	046	013	I have brought near my deliverance; it is not far off; My salvation shall not tarry; I will give to Zion salvation, To Israel, my glory.
023	ISA	047	001	Come down, and sit in the dust, O virgin, daughter of Babylon! Sit on the ground without a throne, O daughter of the Chaldaeans! For thou shalt no longer be called the tender and delicate!
023	ISA	047	002	Take the mill-stones and grind meal; Raise thy veil, lift up thy train; Make bare the leg, wade through the streams!
023	ISA	047	003	Thy nakedness shall be uncovered, And thy shame shall be seen. I will take vengeance; I will make peace with none.
023	ISA	047	004	Our Redeemer, Jehovah of hosts is his name, The Holy One of Israel.
023	ISA	047	005	Sit thou in silence; go into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldaeans! For thou shalt no more be called the mistress of kingdoms.
023	ISA	047	006	I was angry with my people; I profaned my inheritance, And gave them into thy hand; Thou didst show them no mercy; Even upon the aged didst thou lay a very grievous yoke.
023	ISA	047	007	Thou saidst, “I shall be mistress forever”; So that thou didst not lay these things to thy heart, Nor consider what would be the end of them.
023	ISA	047	008	But hear thou this, thou that art given to pleasure! That sittest in security, And sayest in thy heart, “I am, and there is none besides me; I shall not be a widow, Nor see myself childless!”
023	ISA	047	009	Behold, both these things shall come upon thee suddenly, in one day, Loss of children, and widowhood; In full measure shall they come upon thee, In spite of thy many sorceries, And the great abundance of thy enchantments.
023	ISA	047	010	Thou didst trust in thy wickedness, and saidst, “No one seeth me”; Thy wisdom and thy knowledge have led thee astray; Thou saidst in thy heart, “I am, and there is none besides me”;
023	ISA	047	011	Therefore shall evil come upon thee, of which thou shalt not know the dawn; And mischief shall fall upon thee, which thou shalt not be able to expiate; Suddenly shall desolation come upon thee, when thou thinkest not of it.
023	ISA	047	012	Persevere now in thy enchantments; In the multitude of thy sorceries, in which thou hast labored from thy youth; Perhaps thou mayst be profited by them! Perhaps thou mayst make thyself feared!
023	ISA	047	013	Art thou wearied with thy many devices? Let them stand up, then, and save thee, The observers of the heavens, the star-gazers, They that prognosticate at every new moon The things that shall come upon thee!
023	ISA	047	014	Behold, they shall be like stubble; the fire shall burn them up; They shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame; Not a coal shall be left of them to warm one, Nor a spark of fire to sit by.
023	ISA	047	015	Thus shall it be with them with whom thou hast labored; Thus with them with whom thou hast trafficked from thy youth; They shall go every one his own way; None shall help thee.
023	ISA	048	001	Hear this, O house of Jacob! Ye that are called by the name of Israel; Ye that have come forth from the fountain of Judah; Ye that swear by the name of Jehovah, And praise the God of Israel, But not in truth and sincerity!
023	ISA	048	002	For they call themselves of the holy city, And stay themselves on the God of Israel, Whose name is Jehovah of hosts: —
023	ISA	048	003	What hath happened I declared to you long ago; From my mouth it proceeded, and I made it known; On a sudden I effected it, and it came to pass.
023	ISA	048	004	Because I knew that thou art obstinate, And that thy neck is a bar of iron, And that thy brow is brass,
023	ISA	048	005	I declared it to thee long ago; Before it came to pass, I made it known to thee; Lest thou shouldst say, My idol effected it, And my graven image, and my molten image ordained it.
023	ISA	048	006	Thou hast heard it; now see it all! And will ye not confess it? From this time I make you hear a new thing, Even a hidden thing, which thou hast not known.
023	ISA	048	007	It is produced now, and not long ago; Before this day thou hast not heard of it, Lest thou shouldst say, Behold, I knew it.
023	ISA	048	008	Yea, thou heardest it not; yea, thou knewest it not; Yea, it was not disclosed to thee long ago; For I knew that thou wast wholly faithless, And wast called rebellious from thy birth.
023	ISA	048	009	For the sake of my name I will defer my anger, And for the sake of my praise I will restrain it from thee, That I may not utterly cut thee off.
023	ISA	048	010	Behold, I have melted thee, and found no silver; I have tried thee in the furnace of affliction.
023	ISA	048	011	For mine own sake will I do it; For how would my name be blasphemed? And my glory will I not give to another.
023	ISA	048	012	Hearken to me, O Jacob, And Israel, whom I have called! I am He, I am the first, and I the last.
023	ISA	048	013	Yea, my hand hath founded the earth, And my right hand hath spread out the heavens; I called them; they stood forth together.
023	ISA	048	014	Assemble yourselves, all of you, and hear! Who among you hath declared these things? He whom Jehovah loveth will execute his pleasure upon Babylon, And his power upon the Chaldaeans.
023	ISA	048	015	I, even I, have spoken; yea, I have called him; I have brought him, and his way shall be prosperous.
023	ISA	048	016	Draw near to me, and hear ye this! I spake not in secret from the beginning; And since it began to be, I have been there; And now hath the Lord Jehovah sent me with his spirit.
023	ISA	048	017	Thus saith Jehovah, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; I am Jehovah, thy God, who teacheth thee what will profit thee; Who leadeth thee in the way thou shouldst go.
023	ISA	048	018	O that thou wouldst hearken to my commandments! Then shall thy peace be as a river, And thy prosperity as the waves of the sea;
023	ISA	048	019	Then shall thy posterity be as the sand, And the fruit of thy body as the offspring of the sea; Thy name shall not be cut off, nor destroyed before me.
023	ISA	048	020	Come ye forth from Babylon, flee ye from the land of the Chaldaeans with the voice of joy! Publish ye this, and make it known; Let it resound to the ends of the earth! Say: “Jehovah hath redeemed his servant Jacob;
023	ISA	048	021	They thirst not in the deserts through which he leadeth them; Waters from the rock he causeth to flow for them; He cleaveth the rock, and the waters gush forth.
023	ISA	048	022	There is no peace, saith Jehovah, for the wicked.”
023	ISA	049	001	Listen to me, ye distant lands! Attend, ye nations from afar! Jehovah called me at my birth; In my very childhood he called me by name.
023	ISA	049	002	He made my mouth like a sharp sword; In the shadow of his hand did he hide me. He made me a polished shaft; In his quiver did he hide me.
023	ISA	049	003	He said to me, Thou art my servant; Israel, in whom I will be glorified.
023	ISA	049	004	Then I said, I have labored in vain; For naught, for vanity, have I spent my strength; Yet my cause is with Jehovah, And my reward with my God.
023	ISA	049	005	And now thus saith Jehovah, Who formed me from my birth to be his servant To bring Jacob to him again, And that Israel might be gathered to him, —For I am honored in the eyes of Jehovah, And my God is my strength, —
023	ISA	049	006	He said, It is a small tiling that thou shouldst be my servant, To raise up the tribes of Jacob, And to restore the preserved of Israel; I will also make thee the light of the nations, That my salvation may reach the ends of the earth.
023	ISA	049	007	Thus saith Jehovah, the Redeemer of Israel, his Holy One, To him that is despised by men, abhorred by the people, To the servant of tyrants; Kings shall see, and stand up, Princes, and they shall pay homage, On account of Jehovah, who is faithful, The Holy One of Israel, who hath chosen thee.
023	ISA	049	008	Thus saith Jehovah; In the time of favor will I hear thee; In the day of deliverance will I help thee; I will preserve thee, and make thee a mediator for the people, To restore the land, to distribute the desolated inheritances;
023	ISA	049	009	To say to the prisoners, Go forth! To them that are in darkness, Come to the light! They shall feed in the ways, And on all high places shall be their pasture.
023	ISA	049	010	They shall not hunger, neither shall they thirst; Neither shall the heat nor the sun smite them; For he that hath compassion on them shall lead them; To springs of water shall he guide them.
023	ISA	049	011	And I will make all my mountains a highway; And my roads shall be prepared.
023	ISA	049	012	Behold! these shall come from far; And behold! these from the North and from the West, And these from the land of Sinim.
023	ISA	049	013	Sing, O ye heavens, and rejoice, O earth! Break forth into singing, ye mountains! For Jehovah comforteth his people, And hath compassion on his afflicted ones.
023	ISA	049	014	Zion saith, “Jehovah hath forsaken me; The Lord hath forgotten me.”
023	ISA	049	015	Can a woman forget her sucking child, So as not to have compassion on the son of her womb? Yet, should they forget, I will never forget thee!
023	ISA	049	016	Behold, I have graven thee on the palms of my hands; Thy walls are ever before my eyes.
023	ISA	049	017	Thy children shall make haste; They that destroyed and laid thee waste shall depart from thee.
023	ISA	049	018	Lift up thine eyes around, and see! They all assemble themselves, and come to thee. As I live, saith Jehovah, Thou shalt surely clothe thee with them all, as with a rich dress; Thou shalt bind them on thee, as a bride her jewels.
023	ISA	049	019	For thy waste and desolate places, and thy land laid in ruins, Shall now be too narrow for the inhabitants; And they that devoured thee shall be far away.
023	ISA	049	020	Thou, that hast been childless, shalt yet hear thy sons exclaim: “The place is too narrow for me; make room for me that I may dwell.”
023	ISA	049	021	And thou shalt say in thy heart, Who hath begotten me these? I surely was childless and unfruitful, An exile, and an outcast; who then hath brought up these? Behold, I was left alone; these, then, where were they?
023	ISA	049	022	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will lift up my hand to the nations, And set up my standard to the kingdoms; They shall bring thy sons in their arms, And thy daughters upon their shoulders.
023	ISA	049	023	And kings shall be thy nursing fathers, And queens thy nursing mothers; Upon their faces shall they bow down before thee, And lick the dust of thy feet. Thus shalt thou know that I am Jehovah; And they who trust in me shall not be put to shame.
023	ISA	049	024	Shall the prey be taken away from the mighty? Or shall the spoil of the terrible be rescued?
023	ISA	049	025	Yea, thus saith Jehovah, The prey shall be taken away from the mighty, And the spoil of the terrible shall be rescued; For with him that contendeth with thee will I contend, And I will save thy children.
023	ISA	049	026	And I will cause thine oppressors to eat their own flesh; With their own blood shall they be drunk, as with new wine; And all flesh shall know that I Jehovah am thy saviour; That thy redeemer is the Mighty One of Jacob.
023	ISA	050	001	Thus saith Jehovah: Where is the bill of your mother's divorcement, By which I dismissed her? Or who is he among my creditors To whom I have sold you? Behold, for your iniquities are ye sold, And for your transgressions was your mother dismissed.
023	ISA	050	002	Wherefore, when I came, was no man at hand? When I called, was there none to answer? Is my hand too short to redeem? Or have I no power to deliver? Behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea, And make the rivers a desert. Their fish putrefy for want of water, And die with thirst.
023	ISA	050	003	I clothe the heavens with blackness, And make sackcloth their covering.
023	ISA	050	004	The Lord Jehovah hath given me the tongue of the learned, That I might know how to strengthen with my words them that are weary; He wakeneth me every morning, He wakeneth mine ear, That I may hear in the manner of the learned.
023	ISA	050	005	The Lord Jehovah opened mine ear, And I was not disobedient, Neither did I withdraw myself backward.
023	ISA	050	006	I gave my back to the smiters, And my cheeks to them that pluck the beard; I hid not my face from shame and spitting.
023	ISA	050	007	But the Lord Jehovah is my helper, Therefore shall I not be confounded; Therefore have I made my face like a flint, For I know that I shall not be put to shame.
023	ISA	050	008	He that defendeth my cause is near; Who will contend with me? Let us stand up together! Who is my adversary? Let him come near to me!
023	ISA	050	009	Behold, the Lord Jehovah is my defender; Who is he that shall condemn me? Behold, they shall all waste away like a garment; The moth shall consume them.
023	ISA	050	010	Who is there among you that feareth Jehovah, That hearkeneth to the voice of his servant, That walketh in darkness and hath no light? Let him trust in the name of Jehovah, And lean upon his God.
023	ISA	050	011	Behold, all ye who kindle a fire, Who gird yourselves with burning arrows! Walk ye in the light of your fire, And in the burning arrows which ye have kindled. This shall ye have from my hand; Ye shall lie down in sorrow.
023	ISA	051	001	Hearken to me, ye that pursue righteousness. Ye that seek Jehovah! Look to the rock whence ye were hewn, To the pit-quarry whence ye were digged!
023	ISA	051	002	Look to Abraham your father, And to Sarah that bore you! For I called him when only one, And blessed him, and multiplied him.
023	ISA	051	003	Thus will Jehovah have pity upon Zion; He will have pity upon all her desolations. He will make her wilderness like Eden, Her desert like the garden of Jehovah. Joy and gladness shall be found therein; Thanksgiving, and the voice of melody.
023	ISA	051	004	Hearken to me, O my people! And give ear to me, O my nation! For a law shall proceed from me, And I will establish my statutes for the light of the nations.
023	ISA	051	005	My help is near; my salvation goeth forth; My arm shall judge the nations; Distant lands shall wait for me, And in my arm shall they trust.
023	ISA	051	006	Lift up your eyes to the heavens, And look down upon the earth beneath! For the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, And the earth shall decay like a garment, And its inhabitants shall perish like flies. But my salvation shall endure forever, And my goodness shall not decay.
023	ISA	051	007	Hearken to me, ye that know righteousness, The people in whose heart is my law! Fear ye not the reproach of men, Nor be disheartened by their revilings!
023	ISA	051	008	For the moth shall consume them like a garment, And the worm shall eat them like wool. But my goodness shall endure forever, And my salvation from generation to generation.
023	ISA	051	009	Awake! awake! clothe thyself with strength, O arm of Jehovah! Awake, as in the ancient days, in the generations of old!
023	ISA	051	010	Art thou not the same that smote Rahab, And wounded the dragon? Art thou not the same that dried up the sea, The waters of the great deep, —That made the depths of the sea a path for the redeemed to pass through?
023	ISA	051	011	Thus shall the ransomed of Jehovah return; They shall come to Zion with singing; Everlasting joy shall be upon their heads; They shall obtain gladness and joy, And sorrow and sighing shall flee away.
023	ISA	051	012	I, even I, am he that hath pity upon you; Who art thou, that thou art afraid of man, that shall die, Of the son of man, that shall perish like grass,
023	ISA	051	013	And forgettest Jehovah thy maker, That stretched out the heavens, And founded the earth, And fearest continually every day, On account of the fury of the oppressor, As if he were taking aim to destroy thee? Where now is the fury of the oppressor?
023	ISA	051	014	Soon shall the enchained be loosed; He shall not die in the pit, Nor shall his bread fail.
023	ISA	051	015	For I am Jehovah thy God, That rebuketh the sea when his waves roar; Jehovah of hosts is his name.
023	ISA	051	016	I have put my words into thy mouth, And have covered thee with the shadow of my hand, To establish the heavens, and to found the earth. And to say to Zion, “Thou art my people!”
023	ISA	051	017	Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem! Thou that hast drunk from the hand of Jehovah the cup of his fury, Thou that hast drunk to the dregs the cup of giddiness!
023	ISA	051	018	There is not one to lead her, of all the sons which she hath brought forth, Nor is there one to take her by the hand, of all the sons which she hath nurtured.
023	ISA	051	019	These two things have come upon thee, And who bemoaneth thee? Desolation and destruction, and famine and the sword; How shall I comfort thee?
023	ISA	051	020	Thy sons have fainted; they lie at the head of all the streets, Like a deer in the net; They are full of the wrath of Jehovah, Of the rebuke of thy God.
023	ISA	051	021	Therefore, hear this, thou afflicted, Thou drunken, and not with wine!
023	ISA	051	022	Thus saith thy Lord, Jehovah, And thy God, that defendeth the cause of his people. Behold, I will take from thy hand the cup of giddiness, The cup of my wrath; Thou shalt drink no more of it.
023	ISA	051	023	And I will put it into the hand of them that have afflicted thee; That have said to thee, “Bow down, that we may pass over!” And thou madest thy body as the ground, And as the street, to them that passed over.
023	ISA	052	001	Awake, awake, put on thy majesty, O Zion! Put on thy beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city! For no more shall come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean.
023	ISA	052	002	Shake thyself from the dust, Arise and sit erect, O Jerusalem! Loose thyself from the bands of thy neck, O captive daughter of Zion!
023	ISA	052	003	For thus saith Jehovah: For naught were ye sold, And without money shall ye be ransomed.
023	ISA	052	004	For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: My people went down to Egypt formerly to sojourn there, And the Assyrian oppressed them without cause.
023	ISA	052	005	And now, what have I here to do, saith the Lord, When my people is taken away for naught, And their tyrants exult, saith Jehovah, And all the day long my name is blasphemed.
023	ISA	052	006	Therefore shall my people know my name; Therefore in that day shall they know That I am he that said, Behold, here am I!
023	ISA	052	007	How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, of him that proclaimeth peace! That bringeth good tidings, that proclaimeth salvation! That saith to Zion, “Thy God is king!”
023	ISA	052	008	Hark! the voice of thy watchmen! They lift up the voice together; yea, they shout! For eye to eye shall they behold, When Jehovah returneth to Zion.
023	ISA	052	009	Break forth into joy; shout together, ye ruins of Jerusalem! For Jehovah hath pity on his people; he redeemeth Jerusalem.
023	ISA	052	010	Jehovah maketh bare his holy arm In the sight of all the nations; All the ends of the earth Behold the salvation from our God.
023	ISA	052	011	Depart, depart ye; go ye out from thence; Touch no unclean thing! Go ye out from the midst of her; Be ye clean, ye that bear the vessels of Jehovah!
023	ISA	052	012	For not in haste shall ye go forth, Nor in flight shall ye pass along; For Jehovah shall march in your front, And the God of Israel bring up your rear.
023	ISA	052	013	Behold, my servant shall prosper; He shall be lifted up, and set on high, and greatly exalted.
023	ISA	052	014	As many were amazed at the sight of him, —So disfigured and scarcely human was his visage, And so unlike that of a man was his form, —
023	ISA	052	015	So shall he cause many nations to exult on account of him; Kings shall shut their mouths before him. For what had never been told them shall they see, And what they never heard shall they perceive.
023	ISA	053	001	Who hath believed our report, And to whom hath the arm of Jehovah been revealed?
023	ISA	053	002	For He grew up before him like a tender plant, Like a sucker from a dry soil; He had no form, nor comeliness, that we should look upon him, Nor beauty, that we should take pleasure in him.
023	ISA	053	003	He was despised, and forsaken of men, A man of sorrows, and acquainted with disease; As one from whom men hide their faces, He was despised, and we esteemed him not.
023	ISA	053	004	But he bore our diseases, And carried our pains, And we esteemed him stricken from above, Smitten of God, and afflicted.
023	ISA	053	005	But he was wounded for our transgressions; He was bruised for our iniquities; For our peace was the chastisement upon him, And by his stripes are we healed.
023	ISA	053	006	All we, like sheep, were going astray; We turned every one to his own way, And Jehovah laid upon him the iniquity of us all.
023	ISA	053	007	He was oppressed, that was already afflicted. Yet he opened not his mouth; As a lamb that is led to the slaughter, And as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, He opened not his mouth.
023	ISA	053	008	By oppression and punishment he was taken away, And who in his generation would consider That he was cut off from the land of the living, That for the transgression of my people he was smitten?
023	ISA	053	009	His grave was appointed with the wicked, And with the rich man was his sepulchre, Although he had done no injustice, And there was no deceit in his mouth.
023	ISA	053	010	It pleased Jehovah severely to bruise him; But when he hath made his life a sacrifice for sin, He shall see posterity; he shall prolong his days, And the pleasure of Jehovah shall prosper in his hand.
023	ISA	053	011	Free from his sorrows, he shall see and be satisfied; By his knowledge shall my righteous servant lead many to righteousness, And he shall bear their iniquities.
023	ISA	053	012	Therefore will I give him his portion with the mighty, And with heroes shall he divide the spoil, Because he poured out his soul unto death, And was numbered with transgressors; Because he bore the sin of many, And made intercession for transgressors.
023	ISA	054	001	Sing, O thou barren, that didst not hear! Break forth into singing, and shout for joy, thou that wast not in travail! For more are the children of the desolate Than of the married woman, saith Jehovah.
023	ISA	054	002	Enlarge the place of thy tent, And let the canopy of thy habitation be extended! Spare not; lengthen thy cords, And make fast thy stakes!
023	ISA	054	003	For on the right hand and on the left shalt thou burst forth with increase; And thy posterity shall inherit the nations, And people the desolate cities.
023	ISA	054	004	Fear not, for thou shalt not be confounded; Blush not, for thou shalt not be put to shame. For thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth, And the reproach of thy widowhood thou shalt remember no more.
023	ISA	054	005	For thy husband is thy Maker; Jehovah of hosts is his name. Thy redeemer is the Holy One of Israel; The God of the whole earth shall he be called.
023	ISA	054	006	For as a woman forsaken, and deeply afflicted, hath Jehovah recalled thee, And as a wife wedded in youth, that hath been rejected, saith thy God.
023	ISA	054	007	For a little moment I have forsaken thee, But with great mercy will I gather thee.
023	ISA	054	008	In overflowing wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment. But with everlasting kindness will I have mercy upon thee, Saith thy redeemer, Jehovah.
023	ISA	054	009	As in the time of the waters of Noah, so shall it be now; As I swore that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth, So do I swear that I will not be angry with thee, nor rebuke thee.
023	ISA	054	010	For the mountains shall depart, And the hills be overthrown, But my kindness shall not depart from thee, Nor shall my covenant of peace be overthrown, Saith Jehovah, that hath pity on thee.
023	ISA	054	011	O thou afflicted, beaten with the storm, destitute of consolation! Behold, I lay thy stones in cement of vermilion, And thy foundations with sapphires.
023	ISA	054	012	And I will make thy battlements of rubies, And thy gates of carbuncles, And all thy borders fill of precious stones.
023	ISA	054	013	All thy children shall be taught by Jehovah, And great shall be the prosperity of thy children.
023	ISA	054	014	By righteousness shalt thou be established; Be thou far from anxiety, for thou shalt have nothing to fear, And from terror, for it shall not come near thee.
023	ISA	054	015	If any be leagued against thee, it is not by my command; Whoever shall be leagued against thee shall come over to thee.
023	ISA	054	016	Behold, I create the smith, Who bloweth up the coals into a fire, And produceth an instrument for his work; I also create the destroyer to lay waste.
023	ISA	054	017	Whatever weapon is formed against thee, it shall not prosper; And against every tongue that contendeth with thee, thou shalt obtain thy cause. This is the inheritance of the servants of Jehovah, And the blessing which they receive from me, saith Jehovah.
023	ISA	055	001	Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters! Even ye that have no money, come ye, buy and eat! Yea, come, buy wine and milk, Without money and without price.
023	ISA	055	002	Wherefore do ye spend your money for that which is not bread, And your substance for that which doth not satisfy? Listen attentively to me; so shall ye eat that which is good, And your soul shall delight itself with delicacies.
023	ISA	055	003	Incline your ear, and come to me; Hear, and your soul shall live! And I will make with you an everlasting covenant; I will give you the sure mercies of David.
023	ISA	055	004	Behold, I gave him for a commander to the nations; For a prince, and a lawgiver to the nations.
023	ISA	055	005	Behold, the nation which thou knowest not thou shalt call; And the nation which knew not thee shall run to thee, For the sake of Jehovah, thy God, And of the Holy One of Israel, for he hath glorified thee.
023	ISA	055	006	Seek ye Jehovah, while he may be found; Call upon him while he is near;
023	ISA	055	007	Let the wicked forsake his way, And the unrighteous man his thoughts; Let him return to Jehovah, and he will have mercy upon him, And to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.
023	ISA	055	008	For my thoughts are not your thoughts, Neither are your ways my ways, saith Jehovah.
023	ISA	055	009	For as the heavens are higher than the earth, So are my ways higher than your ways, And my thoughts than your thoughts.
023	ISA	055	010	For as the rain and the snow descend from heaven, And return not thither, But water the earth, and make it bear and put forth its increase, That it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater;
023	ISA	055	011	So shall my word be, that goeth forth from my mouth; It shall not return to me void; But it shall bring to pass that which is my pleasure, And it shall accomplish that for which I send it.
023	ISA	055	012	For ye shall go out with joy And be led forth with peace; The mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing, And all the trees of the field shall clap their hands.
023	ISA	055	013	Instead of the thorn shall grow up the cypress-tree, And instead of the bramble shall grow up the myrtle-tree, And it shall be to Jehovah for a name; For an everlasting memorial, that shall not pass away.
023	ISA	056	001	Thus saith Jehovah: Keep ye justice, and practise righteousness; For the coming of my salvation is near, And my deliverance is soon to be revealed.
023	ISA	056	002	Happy the man that doeth this, And the son of man that holdeth it fast; That keepeth the sabbath, and profaneth it not, And restraineth his hand from doing evil.
023	ISA	056	003	And let not the stranger that joineth himself to Jehovah say, Jehovah hath wholly separated me from his people. And let not the eunuch say, Behold, I am a dry tree!
023	ISA	056	004	For thus saith Jehovah concerning the eunuchs: They that keep my sabbaths, And take pleasure in doing my will, And hold fast my covenant,
023	ISA	056	005	To them will I give in my house, and within my walls, a portion and a name, Better than of sons and daughters; An everlasting name will I give them, That shall never fade away.
023	ISA	056	006	The strangers, also, that join themselves to Jehovah, to serve him, To love the name of Jehovah, and to be his servants. Every one that keepeth the sabbath, and profaneth it not, And holdeth fast my covenant,
023	ISA	056	007	Them will I bring to my holy mountain, And I will make them rejoice in my house of prayer; Their burnt-offerings and sacrifices shall be accepted on mine altar; For my house shall be called a house of prayer for all nations.
023	ISA	056	008	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, That gathereth the outcasts of Israel; Yet will I gather others to him, Besides those that are already gathered.
023	ISA	056	009	Come, all ye beasts of the field, Yea, all ye beasts of the forest, to devour!
023	ISA	056	010	His watchmen are all blind; they know nothing; They are all dumb dogs, that cannot bark, Dreaming, lying down, loving to slumber;
023	ISA	056	011	Yet are they greedy dogs that cannot be satisfied; The shepherds themselves will not attend; They all turn aside to their own way, Every one of them to their own gain.
023	ISA	056	012	“Come on, let me bring wine, And let us fill ourselves with strong drink, And to-morrow shall be as to-day, And even much more abundant.”
023	ISA	057	001	The righteous man perisheth, and no one layeth it to heart; And pious men are taken away, and none considereth That because of the evil the righteous man is taken away.
023	ISA	057	002	He entereth into peace; He resteth in his bed, Every one that walketh in uprightness.
023	ISA	057	003	But draw near hither, ye sons of the sorceress, Ye brood of the adulterer and the harlot!
023	ISA	057	004	Of whom do ye make your sport, And at whom do ye make wide the mouth, And draw out the tongue? Are ye not rebellious children, a treacherous brood?
023	ISA	057	005	Burning with lust for idols Under every green tree, Slaying children in the valleys, Under the clefts of the rocks?
023	ISA	057	006	With the smooth stones of the valley is thy portion; These, these are thy lot; Here thou pourest out thy drink-offering, And presentest thy meat-offering; Can I see such things, and be at rest?
023	ISA	057	007	Upon a high and lofty mountain settest thou thy bed; Thither dost thou go up to offer sacrifice;
023	ISA	057	008	Behind the doors and the posts dost thou place thy memorial; Thou departest from me, and uncoverest, and ascendest, and enlargest thy bed. Thou makest an agreement with them; Thou desirest their bed; Thou choosest a place.
023	ISA	057	009	Thou goest to the king with oil, And takest much precious perfume; Thou sendest thine ambassadors afar, Yea, down to the under-world.
023	ISA	057	010	In the length of thy journeys thou hast wearied thyself, But thou sayest not, “I will desist”; Thou yet findest life in thy hand, Therefore thou art not discouraged.
023	ISA	057	011	On account of whom art thou anxious, and of whom art thou afraid, that thou hast proved false, And hast not remembered me, nor laid it to heart? Behold, I have been silent a long time; Therefore thou fearest me not.
023	ISA	057	012	But now I announce thy deliverance, And thy works do not profit thee.
023	ISA	057	013	When thou criest, let thy host of idols deliver thee! But the wind shall bear them all away; A breath shall take them off; But he that putteth his trust in me Shall possess the land, And shall inherit my holy mountain.
023	ISA	057	014	Men shall say, Cast up, cast up, prepare the road; Remove every obstruction from the way of my people!
023	ISA	057	015	For thus saith the high and lofty One That inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy: I dwell in the high and holy place; With him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit; To revive the spirit of the humble, And to revive the heart of the contrite ones.
023	ISA	057	016	For I will not contend forever, Nor will I be always angry; For life would fail before me, And the souls which I created.
023	ISA	057	017	For the guilt of his covetousness I was angry; I smote him, I hid myself, and was angry; But yet he went on perversely in the way of his heart.
023	ISA	057	018	I have seen his ways, yet will I heal him; I will guide him, and I will restore comfort To him and to his mourners;
023	ISA	057	019	I create the fruit of the lips. Peace, peace to him that is far off, and to him that is nigh, Saith Jehovah; I will heal him.
023	ISA	057	020	But the wicked is like the troubled sea, Which cannot rest, Whose waters cast up mire and dirt.
023	ISA	057	021	There is no peace, saith my God, for the wicked.
023	ISA	058	001	Cry aloud, spare not, Lift up thy voice like a trumpet, And show my people their transgression, And the house of Jacob their sins!
023	ISA	058	002	Yet they seek me daily, And desire to know my ways, As a nation that hath done righteousness, And hath not forsaken the ordinances of their God; They inquire of me concerning the judgments which bring salvation; They long for the coming of God.
023	ISA	058	003	“Wherefore do we fast, and thou seest not? Wherefore do we afflict our souls, and thou dost not regard it?” Behold, in the day of your fasts ye pursue your pleasure, And exact all your labors.
023	ISA	058	004	Behold, ye fast in strife and contention, And smiting with the fist of wickedness. Ye do not fast now So that your voice shall be heard on high.
023	ISA	058	005	Is this the fast that I approve, A day for a man to afflict his soul? Is it that he should bow down his head like a bulrush, And lie down in sackcloth and ashes? Wilt thou call this a fast, And a day acceptable to Jehovah?
023	ISA	058	006	Is not this the fast that I approve, —To loose the bands of wickedness, To undo the heavy burdens, To let the oppressed go free, And to break in pieces every yoke?
023	ISA	058	007	Is it not to break thy bread to the hungry, And to bring the poor, that are cast out, to thy house? When thou seest the naked, that thou clothe him, And that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh?
023	ISA	058	008	Then shall thy light break forth like the morning, And thy health shall spring forth speedily; Thy salvation shall go before thee, And the glory of Jehovah shall bring up thy rear.
023	ISA	058	009	Then shalt thou call, and Jehovah will answer; Thou shalt cry, and he shall say, Lo, here I am! If thou remove from the midst of thee the yoke, The pointing of the finger, and the injurious speech.
023	ISA	058	010	If thou bring forth thy bread to the hungry, And satisfy the afflicted soul, Then in obscurity shall light arise to thee; Yea, thy darkness shall become as noonday;
023	ISA	058	011	Jehovah shall lead thee continually, And satisfy thee in the time of drought, And strengthen thy bones; Thou shalt be like a watered garden, and a spring of water, Whose waters never fail.
023	ISA	058	012	Thy people shall build the ancient desolations, The ruins of many generations shall they restore; Thou shalt be called the repairer of the breach, The restorer of ways for inhabitants.
023	ISA	058	013	If thou restrain thy foot from the sabbath, From doing thy pleasure on my holy day, If thou shalt call the sabbath a delight, The holy day of Jehovah honorable, And shalt honor it by refraining from thy work, From doing thy pleasure, and speaking vain words,
023	ISA	058	014	Then shalt thou delight thyself in Jehovah. And I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, And cause thee to enjoy the inheritance of Jacob, thy father; For the mouth of Jehovah hath spoken it.
023	ISA	059	001	Behold, Jehovah's hand is not shortened, that it cannot save, Nor is his ear heavy, that it cannot hear;
023	ISA	059	002	But your iniquities have separated you from your God, And your sins have hidden his face from you, that he doth not hear.
023	ISA	059	003	For your hands are polluted with blood, And your fingers with iniquity; Your lips speak falsehood, And your tongue muttereth wickedness.
023	ISA	059	004	No one bringeth his suit with justice, And no one pleadeth with truth; They trust in vain words, and speak lies; They conceive mischief, and bring forth destruction.
023	ISA	059	005	They hatch the eggs of the basilisk, And weave the web of the spider; He that eateth of their eggs dieth, And when one of them is crushed, a viper breaketh forth.
023	ISA	059	006	Of their webs no garment is made, Nor can one cover himself with their work; Their works are works of iniquity, And the deed of violence is in their hands.
023	ISA	059	007	Their feet run to evil; They make haste to shed innocent blood. Their thoughts are evil thoughts; Oppression and destruction are in their paths.
023	ISA	059	008	The way of peace they know not, Nor is there any justice in their steps; They have made for themselves crooked paths; Whoso goeth in them knoweth not peace.
023	ISA	059	009	Therefore is judgment far from us, And deliverance doth not overtake us. We look for light, and behold obscurity; For brightness, and we walk in darkness.
023	ISA	059	010	We grope for the wall, like the blind; We feel our way, like those that are deprived of sight; We stumble at noonday as in the night; In the midst of fertile fields we are like the dead.
023	ISA	059	011	We groan, all of us, like bears, And like doves we make a continued moan; We look for judgment, and it cometh not; For salvation, and it is far from us.
023	ISA	059	012	For our transgressions are multiplied before thee, And our sins testify against us! For our transgressions are not hidden from us, And our iniquities we know.
023	ISA	059	013	We have rebelled, and proved false to Jehovah; We have departed from our God; We have spoken violence and rebellion; Our hearts have conceived and brought forth words of falsehood.
023	ISA	059	014	And justice is turned back, And equity standeth afar off, For truth falleth in the gate, And rectitude cannot enter.
023	ISA	059	015	Truth is not to be found, And he that departeth from evil is plundered; And Jehovah saw it, And it displeased him that there was no justice.
023	ISA	059	016	He saw that there was none to help, And wondered that there was none to interpose; Then his own arm wrought salvation for him, And his righteousness it supported him.
023	ISA	059	017	He put on righteousness as a breastplate, And the helmet of salvation upon his head; He put on garments of vengeance for his clothing, And clad himself with zeal, as with a mantle.
023	ISA	059	018	According to their deeds will he repay them, —Wrath to his adversaries, recompense to his enemies; To the distant coasts will he repay a recompense.
023	ISA	059	019	They in the west shall fear the name of Jehovah, And they in the rising of the sun his glory, When he cometh like a river straitened in its course, Which a strong wind driveth along.
023	ISA	059	020	Yet shall a redeemer come to Zion, For them that turn from their transgressions in Jacob, saith Jehovah.
023	ISA	059	021	And as for me, this is my covenant with them, saith Jehovah: My spirit, which is upon thee, And my words, which I have put in thy mouth, They shall not depart from thy mouth, Nor from the mouth of thy sons, Nor from the mouth of thy sons' sons, saith Jehovah, From this time forth forever.
023	ISA	060	001	Arise, shine! for thy light is come, And the glory of Jehovah is risen upon thee.
023	ISA	060	002	For, behold, darkness shall cover the earth, And gross darkness the nations; But upon thee shall Jehovah arise, And his glory shall be seen upon thee.
023	ISA	060	003	Nations shall come to thy light, And kings to the brightness that riseth upon thee.
023	ISA	060	004	Lift up thine eyes round about and see! They all gather themselves together, and come to thee; Thy sons come from afar, And thy daughters are carried at thy side.
023	ISA	060	005	Then shalt thou see, and be bright with joy; Thy heart shall throb, and swell with delight, When the riches of the sea shall be turned toward thee, And the wealth of the nations shall come to thee.
023	ISA	060	006	A multitude of camels shall cover thee, Dromedaries from Midian and Ephah; From Sheba shall they all come. Gold and frankincense shall they bring, And proclaim the praises of Jehovah.
023	ISA	060	007	All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered to thee, And the rams of Nebaioth shall minister to thee; They shall ascend mine altar, an acceptable offering, And my glorious house I will adorn.
023	ISA	060	008	Who are these that fly like clouds, And like doves to their habitations?
023	ISA	060	009	Behold, the distant coasts shall wait for me, And the ships of Tarshish among the first, To bring thy sons from afar, And their silver and their gold with them, Because of the name of Jehovah thy God, Of the Holy One of Israel, for he glorifieth thee.
023	ISA	060	010	The sons of the stranger shall build up thy walls, And their kings shall minister to thee; For in my wrath I smote thee, But in my mercy will I have pity upon thee.
023	ISA	060	011	Thy gates shall be open continually; They shall not be shut by day or by night, That the treasures of the nations may be brought to thee, And that their kings may come with their retinues.
023	ISA	060	012	For that nation and that kingdom Which will not serve thee shall perish; Yea, those nations shall be utterly destroyed.
023	ISA	060	013	The glory of Lebanon shall come to thee, The cypress, the plane-tree, and the larch together, To adorn the place of my sanctuary, That I may make the place where my feet rest glorious.
023	ISA	060	014	The sons of thine oppressors shall come bending before thee; They that despised thee shall fall down at thy feet; And they shall call thee the city of Jehovah, The Zion of the Holy One of Israel.
023	ISA	060	015	Instead of being forsaken and hated, So that no one passed through thee, I will make thee an everlasting glory; The joy of many generations.
023	ISA	060	016	Thou shalt also suck the milk of the nations, And be nursed from the breast of kings; And thou shalt know that I, Jehovah, am thy saviour, That thy redeemer is the Mighty One of Jacob.
023	ISA	060	017	Instead of brass will I bring gold; And instead of iron will I bring silver, And instead of wood, brass, And instead of stones, iron; I will make thine officers peace, And thy magistrates righteousness.
023	ISA	060	018	Violence shall no more be heard in thy land, Wasting or destruction within thy borders; Thou shalt call thy walls Salvation, And thy gates Praise.
023	ISA	060	019	No more shall the sun be thy light by day, Nor with her brightness shall the moon enlighten thee: But Jehovah shall be to thee an everlasting light, And thy God thy glory.
023	ISA	060	020	Thy sun shall no more go down, Neither shall thy moon be hid; For Jehovah shall be thine everlasting light, And the days of thy mourning shall be ended.
023	ISA	060	021	Thy people shall be all righteous; Forever shall they possess the land, The scion of my planting, The work of my hands, that I may be glorified.
023	ISA	060	022	The little one shall become a thousand, And the small one a strong nation; I, Jehovah, will hasten it in its time.
023	ISA	061	001	The spirit of the Lord Jehovah is upon me, For Jehovah hath anointed me; He hath sent me to publish good tidings to the distressed, To bind up the broken-hearted, To proclaim liberty to the captives, And the opening of the prison to them that are bound;
023	ISA	061	002	To proclaim the year of mercy from Jehovah, And the day of vengeance from our God; To comfort all that mourn;
023	ISA	061	003	To give gladness to the mourners in Zion; To give them a beautiful crown instead of ashes, The oil of joy for mourning, The garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness, So that they shall be called blessed terebinth-trees, The plantation of Jehovah for his glory.
023	ISA	061	004	They shall build up the old ruins; They shall raise up the ancient desolations; They shall repair the cities laid waste, The desolations of many generations.
023	ISA	061	005	Strangers shall stand up and feed your flocks, And the sons of the alien shall be your ploughmen and vine-dressers;
023	ISA	061	006	But ye shall be named the priests of Jehovah, Men shall call you the ministers of our God. Ye shall eat the riches of the nations, And in their glory shall ye make your boast.
023	ISA	061	007	For your shame shall ye have a double reward; And for ignominy ye shall rejoice in your portion; Therefore in your land ye shall possess double; Everlasting joy shall be your portion.
023	ISA	061	008	For I, Jehovah, love justice, I hate rapine and iniquity, I will give them their reward with faithfulness, And an everlasting covenant will I make with them.
023	ISA	061	009	Their race shall be illustrious among the nations, And their offspring among the people; All that see them shall acknowledge That they are a race which Jehovah hath blessed.
023	ISA	061	010	“I will greatly rejoice in Jehovah; My soul shall exult in my God; For he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation; He hath covered me with the mantle of deliverance. As the bridegroom decketh himself with his turban, And as the bride adorneth herself with her jewels.”
023	ISA	061	011	For as the earth putteth forth her shoots, And as a garden causeth its plants to spring forth, So shall the Lord Jehovah cause salvation to spring forth; And praise before all the nations.
023	ISA	062	001	For Zion's sake I will not keep silence, And for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest, Until her deliverance break forth like the shining light, And her salvation like a blazing torch.
023	ISA	062	002	Then shall the nations see thy prosperity, And all the kings thy glory; Thou shalt be called by a new name, Which the mouth of Jehovah shall give thee.
023	ISA	062	003	Thou shalt be a beautiful crown in the hand of Jehovah, A royal diadem in the hand of thy God.
023	ISA	062	004	No more shalt thou be called the Desolate, And thy land, the Forsaken. But thou shall be named My-delight-is-in-her. And thy land the wedded Matron. For Jehovah shall delight in thee, And thy land shall be married.
023	ISA	062	005	For as a young man weddeth a virgin. So shall thy children wed thee. And as a bridegroom rejoiceth in his bride, So shall thy God rejoice in thee.
023	ISA	062	006	Upon thy walls, O Jerusalem, have I set watchmen; All the day, and all the night, shall they not keep silence; O ye that praise Jehovah, keep not silence,
023	ISA	062	007	And give him no rest, Until he establish Jerusalem, and make her a praise in the earth!
023	ISA	062	008	Jehovah hath sworn by his right hand, and his mighty arm: No more will I give thy corn to be food for thine enemies, Nor shall the sons of the stranger drink thy wine, for which thou hast labored.
023	ISA	062	009	But they that reap the harvest shall eat it, And praise Jehovah; And they that gather the vintage shall drink it, In my holy comets.
023	ISA	062	010	Pass ye, pass ye through the gates; Prepare the way for the people; Cast ye up, cast ye up the highway, Clear it from the stones; Lift up on high a standard for the tribes!
023	ISA	062	011	Behold, Jehovah proclaimeth to the end of the earth: “Say ye to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy Deliverer cometh! Behold, his reward is with him, and his recompense before him!”
023	ISA	062	012	They shall be called, The holy people, The redeemed of Jehovah. And thou shalt be called, The Sought out, The Not forsaken City.
023	ISA	063	001	Who is this that cometh from Edom? In scarlet garments from Bozrah? This that is glorious in his apparel, Proud in the greatness of his strength? I that proclaim deliverance, And am mighty to save.
023	ISA	063	002	Wherefore is thine apparel red, And thy garments like those of one that treadeth the wine-vat?
023	ISA	063	003	I have trodden the wine-vat alone, And of the nations there was none with me. And I trod them in mine anger, And I trampled them in my fury, So that their life-blood was sprinkled upon my garments. And I have stained all my apparel.
023	ISA	063	004	For the day of vengeance was in my heart, And the year of my deliverance was come.
023	ISA	063	005	And I looked, and there was none to help, And I wondered, that there was none to uphold; Therefore my own arm wrought salvation for me, And my fury, it sustained me.
023	ISA	063	006	I trod down the nations in my anger; I crushed them in my fury, And spilled their blood upon the ground.
023	ISA	063	007	I will celebrate the mercy of Jehovah, the glory of Jehovah, According to all that he hath done for us; His great goodness to the house of Israel, Which he hath bestowed on it in his tender mercy, and his great kindness.
023	ISA	063	008	He said, Truly they are my people; Children that will not be false; So he was their deliverer.
023	ISA	063	009	In all their straits they had no distress; An angel of his presence saved them; In his love and compassion he redeemed them, He took them up and bore them all the days of old.
023	ISA	063	010	But they rebelled, and grieved his holy spirit; Then did he change himself into their enemy; He himself fought against them.
023	ISA	063	011	Then remembered his people the ancient days, the days of Moses, [[saying, ]] Where is he that brought them up from the sea with the shepherd of his flock? Where is he that put his holy spirit within him?
023	ISA	063	012	That caused his glorious arm to accompany the right hand of Moses, That divided the water before them, To make to himself an everlasting name?
023	ISA	063	013	That led them through the deep, As a horse through a desert, without stumbling?
023	ISA	063	014	As the herd descendeth into the valley, The spirit of Jehovah led them to rest. So didst thou lead thy people, To make for thyself a glorious name.
023	ISA	063	015	Look down from heaven, and behold from thy holy and glorious habitation! Where is thy zeal and thy might? Thy pity and compassion for me, are they restrained?
023	ISA	063	016	Thou, surely, art our father; Abraham is ignorant of us, And Israel knoweth us not. Thou, O Jehovah, art our father; Our deliverer wast thou of old.
023	ISA	063	017	Why, O Jehovah, dost thou suffer us to wander from thy ways, And harden our hearts against thy fear? Return, for thy servants' sake, The tribes of thine inheritance!
023	ISA	063	018	But a little while did thy holy people possess the land; Then our enemies trampled upon thy sanctuary.
023	ISA	063	019	It has been with us as if thou hadst never ruled over us, As if we had not been called by thy name.
023	ISA	064	001	O that thou wouldst rend the heavens, and come down; That the mountains might tremble at thy presence,
023	ISA	064	002	As fire kindleth the dry stubble, As fire causeth water to boil, To make known thy name to thine adversaries, That the nations might tremble at thy presence;
023	ISA	064	003	As thou once didst wonderful things, which we looked not for, And camest down, so that the mountains trembled at thy presence.
023	ISA	064	004	For never have men heard, nor perceived by the ear, Nor hath eye seen, a God beside thee. Who doeth such things for those that trust in him.
023	ISA	064	005	Thou art the friend of those who joyfully do righteousness, Those who remember thee in thy ways. Behold, thou art angry, and we are punished; Long doth the punishment endure, before we are delivered.
023	ISA	064	006	We are all of us an unclean thing; Like a filthy garment is all our righteousness; We are all withered like a leaf, And our sins, like a storm, have blown us away.
023	ISA	064	007	There is none that calleth upon thy name, That stirreth himself up to cleave to thee; For thou hidest thy face from us, And lettest us perish by our iniquities.
023	ISA	064	008	But now, O Jehovah, thou art our father; We are the clay, and thou hast formed us; We are all of us the work of thy hands.
023	ISA	064	009	Be not wroth, O Jehovah, to the uttermost, Nor remember our iniquity forever! Behold, look upon us, we beseech thee, we are all thy people!
023	ISA	064	010	Thy holy cities have become a wilderness; Zion is become a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation.
023	ISA	064	011	Our holy and glorious house, Where our fathers praised thee, Is burned with fire, And all our precious things are laid waste.
023	ISA	064	012	Wilt thou contain thyself at these things, O Jehovah, Wilt thou keep silence, and still grievously afflict us?
023	ISA	065	001	I have heard those that made no supplication; I have been found by those who sought me not; I said, Here I am, here I am, To a people that called not upon my name.
023	ISA	065	002	I have spread out my hands all the day To a rebellious people, That walketh in an evil way, According to their own devices;
023	ISA	065	003	To a people that provoke me to my face continually; That sacrifice in gardens, And burn incense on tiles;
023	ISA	065	004	That sit in sepulchres, And lodge in caverns; That eat swine's flesh, And have broth of unclean things in their vessels;
023	ISA	065	005	Who yet say: Stand by thyself! come not near to me, For I am holier than thou! These are a smoke in my nose, A fire that burneth continually.
023	ISA	065	006	Behold, it stands recorded before me; I will not keep silence, but will requite; I will requite it into their bosoms;
023	ISA	065	007	Your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, saith Jehovah, Who burnt incense on the mountains, And dishonored me on the hills, I will pour the full recompense of their former deeds into their bosom.
023	ISA	065	008	Thus saith Jehovah: As when juice is found in a cluster, Men say, “Destroy it not, for a blessing is in it”; So will I do, for the sake of my servants, and will not destroy the whole;
023	ISA	065	009	I will cause a stem to spring forth from Jacob, And from Judah a possessor of my mountains; My chosen shall possess the land, And my servants shall dwell there.
023	ISA	065	010	And Sharon shall be a fold for flocks, And the valley of Achor a resting-place for herds, For my people that have sought me.
023	ISA	065	011	But ye, who have forsaken Jehovah, And have forgotten my holy mountain, That prepare a table for Fortune, And fill the cup for Destiny,
023	ISA	065	012	Yourselves do I destine to the sword, And all of you shall bow down before the slaughter; Because I called, and ye answered not, I spake, and ye would not hear, But did that which is evil in my sight, And chose that in which I had no delight.
023	ISA	065	013	Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, my servants shall eat, and ye shall be hungry; Behold, my servants shall drink, and ye shall be thirsty; Behold, my servants shall rejoice, and ye shall be confounded;
023	ISA	065	014	Behold, my servants shall sing for gladness of heart, But ye shall shriek for sorrow of heart, And howl for anguish of spirit.
023	ISA	065	015	And ye shall leave your name for a curse to my chosen, And the Lord Jehovah shall slay you; But his servants will he call by another name.
023	ISA	065	016	Whoso blesseth himself in the land Shall bless by the true God; And he that sweareth in the land shall swear by the true God; For the former troubles are forgotten, And they are hid from mine eyes.
023	ISA	065	017	For behold! I create new heavens, and a new earth; The former ones shall not be remembered, Nor shall they be brought to mind any more.
023	ISA	065	018	But ye shall be glad and exult forever In that which I create; For behold! I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, And her people a joy.
023	ISA	065	019	And I will exult in Jerusalem, And rejoice in my people; No more shall be heard therein The voice of weeping and the cry of distress.
023	ISA	065	020	There shall not be there an infant child, nor an old man, That hath not filled the measure of his years; For he that dieth a hundred years old shall die a youth, And the sinner dying a hundred years old shall be held accursed.
023	ISA	065	021	They shall build houses, and inhabit them; They shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them;
023	ISA	065	022	They shall not build, and another inhabit; They shall not plant, and another eat; For as the days of a tree shall be the days of my people, Yea, long shall my chosen enjoy the work of their hands.
023	ISA	065	023	They shall not labor in vain, Nor bring forth children for early death; For they are a race blessed by Jehovah, And their offspring shall remain to them.
023	ISA	065	024	Before they call, I will answer; And while they are yet speaking, I will hear.
023	ISA	065	025	The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, And the lion shall eat straw like the ox, And dust shall be the food of the serpent. They shall not hurt, nor destroy, in all my holy mountain, Saith Jehovah.
023	ISA	066	001	Thus saith Jehovah: Heaven is my throne, And the earth my footstool; Where is the house that ye can build me, And where is the place of my rest?
023	ISA	066	002	For all these things hath my hand made; By it do all these things exist, saith Jehovah. But to this man will I look, Even to him who is humble and of a contrite spirit, And who trembleth at my word.
023	ISA	066	003	He that slayeth an ox killeth a man; He that sacrificeth a lamb beheadeth a dog; He that maketh an oblation offereth swine's blood; He that burneth incense blesseth an idol. Yea, they have chosen their own ways, And in their abominations their souls delight.
023	ISA	066	004	I also will choose their calamities; What they dread I will bring upon them; Because I called, and no one answered, I spake, and they did not hear; But they did what is evil in my sight, And chose that in which I have no delight.
023	ISA	066	005	Hear the word of Jehovah, Ye that tremble at his word! “Your brethren that hate you, And thrust you out for my name's sake, have said, “May Jehovah be glorified, that we may see your joy!” But they shall be confounded.
023	ISA	066	006	A voice of tumult from the city! A voice from the temple! The voice of Jehovah, rendering recompense to his enemies!
023	ISA	066	007	Before she was in travail, she brought forth, Before her pangs came, she was delivered of a son.
023	ISA	066	008	Who hath heard such a thing? Who hath seen such things? Is a country brought forth in a day? Is a nation born at once? For as soon as Zion was in travail, she brought forth her children.
023	ISA	066	009	Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth, saith Jehovah; Shall I, who beget, restrain the birth? saith thy God.
023	ISA	066	010	Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, And exult for her, all ye that love her! Be very joyful with her, all ye that mourn for her!
023	ISA	066	011	That ye may suck, and be satisfied, from the breast of her consolations, That ye may suck and be delighted with the fulness of her glory.
023	ISA	066	012	For thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will bring prosperity to her like a river, And the wealth of the nations like an overflowing stream; Ye shall suck at the breast, Ye shall be carried on the arm, And on the knees shall ye be dandled.
023	ISA	066	013	As one whom his mother comforteth, So will I comfort you; And in Jerusalem shall ye be comforted.
023	ISA	066	014	Ye shall see, and your heart shall rejoice, And your bones shall flourish like a green plant, And the hand of Jehovah shall be manifested to his servants, And be moved with indignation against his enemies.
023	ISA	066	015	For behold, Jehovah cometh with fire, Like a whirlwind are his chariots, To breathe forth his anger in a glowing heat, And his rebuke in flames of fire.
023	ISA	066	016	For with fire will Jehovah contend, And with his sword, with all flesh, And many shall be the slain of Jehovah.
023	ISA	066	017	They who sanctify and purify themselves in the groves, Following one in the midst, Who eat swine's flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse. They shall all perish together, saith Jehovah.
023	ISA	066	018	For I know their works, and their thoughts; The time cometh to gather all nations and tongues together; They shall come, and behold my glory.
023	ISA	066	019	And I will give a sign among them, And of those that escape I will send to the nations, To Tarshish, Phul, and Lud, who draw the bow, to Tubal and Javan, To the distant coasts, who never heard my name, And who never saw my glory; And they shall declare my glory among the nations.
023	ISA	066	020	And they shall bring all your brethren From all the nations, an offering to Jehovah, Upon horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and upon mules and dromedaries, To my holy mountain, Jerusalem, saith Jehovah, As the sons of Israel bring their gifts In pure vessels to the house of Jehovah.
023	ISA	066	021	And of them will I also take For priests and for Levites, saith Jehovah.
023	ISA	066	022	For as the new heavens, And the new earth, which I make, Endure before me, saith Jehovah, So shall your race and your name endure.
023	ISA	066	023	And it shall be, from new moon to new moon, And from sabbath to sabbath, That all flesh shall come and worship before me, saith Jehovah.
023	ISA	066	024	Then shall they go forth and see The dead bodies of the men that rebelled against me! For their worm shall not die, And their fire shall not be quenched, And they shall be an abhorrence to all flesh.

# BOOK	024	JER	Jeremiah	Jeremiah
024	JER	001	001	The words of Jeremiah, the son of Hilkiah, one of the priests, who dwelt in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin;
024	JER	001	002	to whom the word of Jehovah came in the days of Josiah, the son of Amon, king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign;
024	JER	001	003	to whom it also came in the days of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, king of Judah, until the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah, the son of Josiah, king of Judah, until the carrying away of Jerusalem into captivity in the fifth month.
024	JER	001	004	The word of Jehovah came to me, saying:
024	JER	001	005	Before I formed thee in the womb, I knew thee; and before thou camest into the world, I chose thee; I appointed thee to be a prophet to the nations.
024	JER	001	006	Then said I, Alas, O Lord Jehovah! Behold, I am not able to speak; for I am a child.
024	JER	001	007	But Jehovah said to me, Say not, I am a child; but go to whomever I send thee, and speak whatever I command thee!
024	JER	001	008	Be not afraid of them! For I am with thee to help thee, saith Jehovah.
024	JER	001	009	Then Jehovah put forth his hand, and touched my mouth. Jehovah also said to me, Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth.
024	JER	001	010	Behold, I have set thee this day over nations and over kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to overthrow; and to build, and to plant.
024	JER	001	011	Then the word of Jehovah came to me, saying, What seest thou, Jeremiah? And I said, I see a rod of almond-wood.
024	JER	001	012	And Jehovah said to me, Thou hast seen right; for I am watchful over my word to perform it.
024	JER	001	013	And the word of Jehovah came to me a second time, saying, What seest thou? And I said, I see a boiling pot, whose face is turned from the north.
024	JER	001	014	And Jehovah said to me, From the north shall evil break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land.
024	JER	001	015	For, behold, I will call all the tribes of the kingdoms of the north, saith Jehovah; and they shall come, and shall set every one his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all her walls around, and against all the cities of Judah.
024	JER	001	016	And I will pronounce my judgments against them for all their wickedness, in that they have forsaken me, and have burned incense to other gods, and worshipped the work of their own hands.
024	JER	001	017	Thou, therefore, gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak to them all that I command thee; be not afraid of them, lest I confound thee before them.
024	JER	001	018	For, behold, I make thee this day a fortified city, and a pillar of iron, and a wall of brass against all this land, against the kings of Judah, against the princes thereof, against the priests thereof, and against the people of the land.
024	JER	001	019	They shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee; for I will be with thee, saith Jehovah, to help thee.
024	JER	002	001	The word of Jehovah came to me, saying:
024	JER	002	002	Go and proclaim in the ears of Jerusalem, Thus saith Jehovah: I remember the kindness shown thee in thy youth, The love with which I espoused thee, When thou wast led by me through the wilderness, Through a land that was not sown.
024	JER	002	003	Israel was a sacred thing to Jehovah, His first ripe fruit. All that devoured him were held guilty; Evil came upon them, saith Jehovah.
024	JER	002	004	Hear ye the word of Jehovah, O house of Jacob, And all the families of the house of Israel!
024	JER	002	005	Thus saith Jehovah: What fault did your fathers find in me, That they went far from me, And walked after vanity, and practised folly?
024	JER	002	006	They said not, Where is Jehovah, Who brought us up from the land of Egypt, Who led us through the wilderness, Through a land of deserts and pits, Through a land of drought and deathlike gloom, Through a land which no man passed through, And where no man dwelt?
024	JER	002	007	I brought you to a land of fruitful fields, To eat the fruit thereof, and the good thereof; But when ye had come in, ye defiled my land, And made my inheritance an abomination.
024	JER	002	008	The priests said not, Where is Jehovah? And the teachers of the law knew me not; The rulers also rebelled against me; The prophets prophesied in the name of Baal, And walked after things that could not profit.
024	JER	002	009	Therefore I will yet contend with you, saith Jehovah; Yea, with your children's children will I contend.
024	JER	002	010	For pass over to the islands of the Chittaeans, and see; Send ye to Kedar, and inform yourselves well; And see if such a thing hath been done!
024	JER	002	011	Hath any nation changed their gods, even those that are no gods? But my people have changed their glory for that which cannot profit.
024	JER	002	012	Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this! Shudder, and be amazed! saith Jehovah.
024	JER	002	013	For my people have committed two evils; Me have they forsaken, the fountain of living water, And they have hewn out for themselves cisterns, Broken cisterns, that can hold no water.
024	JER	002	014	Is Israel a slave? Is he a home-born servant? Why then hath he become a spoil?
024	JER	002	015	The young lions roar over him; They lift up their voice; They have made his land a desolation; His cities are burned so as to be without an inhabitant.
024	JER	002	016	Even the sons of Noph and Tahpanhes have consumed the crown of thy head.
024	JER	002	017	Hath not this come upon thee, Because thou didst forsake Jehovah thy God, When he would have led thee in the way?
024	JER	002	018	And now what hast thou to do with the way of Egypt, To drink the waters of the Nile? Or what hast thou to do with the way of Assyria, To drink the waters of the Euphrates?
024	JER	002	019	Thy wickedness shall chasten thee, And thy transgressions reprove thee; And thou shalt know and see that it is an evil and bitter thing That thou hast forsaken Jehovah thy God, And that the fear of me is not with thee, Saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts.
024	JER	002	020	Of old hast thou broken thy yoke, And burst thy bands, And said, “I will not be in subjection!” For upon every high hill, And under every green tree, Hast thou reclined, playing the harlot.
024	JER	002	021	Yet I had planted thee a noble vine, Wholly a genuine seed; How then art thou changed to the degenerate shoot of a strange vine?
024	JER	002	022	For though thou wash thee with nitre, And take thee much soap, Yet is thine iniquity black before me, saith Jehovah.
024	JER	002	023	How canst thou say, “I am not polluted,” “I have not gone after Baals”? Behold thy way in the valley! Know what thou hast done, A swift young camel, traversing her ways.
024	JER	002	024	A wild ass, used to the wilderness, That in her desire snuffeth up the wind, In her occasion, who can turn her aside? All that seek her do not weary themselves; In her month they will find her.
024	JER	002	025	Withhold thy feet from being unshod, And thy throat from thirst! But thou sayest, There is no remedy! No! For I love strangers, And after them I will go.
024	JER	002	026	As a thief is ashamed when he is taken, So is the house of Israel ashamed, They, their kings, and their princes, And their priests, and their prophets;
024	JER	002	027	That say to a stock, Thou art my father, And to a stone, Thou hast brought me forth! For they turn the back to me, and not the face. Yet in the time of their trouble they say, Arise and save us!
024	JER	002	028	But where are thy gods, which thou hast made thee? Let them arise, if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble! For according to the number of thy cities are thy gods, O Judah!
024	JER	002	029	Why do ye enter into controversy with me? Ye have all rebelled against me, saith Jehovah.
024	JER	002	030	In vain have I smitten your children; They would receive no correction; Your own sword hath devoured your prophets, Like a destroying lion.
024	JER	002	031	O generation! Behold ye the word of Jehovah! Have I been a wilderness to Israel? Or a land of darkness? Why then say my people, “We will rove at pleasure, We will come no more to thee”?
024	JER	002	032	Can a virgin forget her ornaments, Or a bride her belt? Yet my people have forgotten me, days without number!
024	JER	002	033	Why trimmest thou thy way to seek love? On this account hast thou accustomed thy ways to wickedness.
024	JER	002	034	Upon thy skirts is found the blood of the innocent poor, Whom thou didst not find committing violence.
024	JER	002	035	But notwithstanding all this, thou sayest, I am innocent; Surely his anger is turned away from me. Behold, I will enter into judgment with thee, Because thou sayest, “I have not sinned.”
024	JER	002	036	Why dost thou run so eagerly, changing thy way? By Egypt also shalt thou be put to shame, Even as thou hast been put to shame by Assyria.
024	JER	002	037	From Egypt also shalt thou go forth With thy hands upon thy head. For Jehovah hath rejected the objects of thy confidence, Therefore shalt thou not prosper in them.
024	JER	003	001	It is said, if a man put away his wife, And she go from him, and become another man's, Shall he return to her again? Shall not that land be polluted? But thou hast played the harlot with many lovers; And shalt thou return to me, saith Jehovah?
024	JER	003	002	Lift up thine eyes to the high places, and see! Where hast thou not been defiled? In the ways hast thou sat waiting, As the Arabian in the desert, And hast polluted the land by thy lewdness and thy wickedness.
024	JER	003	003	And although the showers have been withholden, And there hath been no latter rain, Yet thou hast had a harlot's forehead; Thou hast refused to be ashamed.
024	JER	003	004	Wilt thou not from this time cry to me, Thou art my father, Yea, the friend of my youth art thou?
024	JER	003	005	Will he retain his anger forever? Will he keep it forevermore? Behold, thus dost thou speak, But thou doest evil with all thy might.
024	JER	003	006	Jehovah said to me, in the time of King Josiah, Hast thou heard what rebellious Israel hath done? She hath gone upon every high mountain and under every green tree, and there hath played the harlot.
024	JER	003	007	And I said, after she had done all these things, Return thou to me! But she returned not. And her faithless sister Judah saw it.
024	JER	003	008	And I saw, when, for all the adulteries which rebellious Israel had committed, I had put her away, and given her a bill of divorce, that her faithless sister Judah was not afraid, but went and played the harlot also herself.
024	JER	003	009	And when by the fame of her lewdness she had polluted the land, committing adultery with stone and wood,
024	JER	003	010	yet for all this did not her faithless sister Judah return to me with her whole heart, but feignedly, saith Jehovah.
024	JER	003	011	Then said Jehovah to me, Rebellious Israel is less guilty than faithless Judah.
024	JER	003	012	Go and proclaim these words toward the north: —Return, O rebellious Israel, saith Jehovah! I will not turn a frowning face upon you; For I am merciful, saith Jehovah, I retain not anger forever.
024	JER	003	013	Only acknowledge thine iniquity, That thou hast rebelled against Jehovah thy God, And hast roved about to strangers Under every green tree, And hast not obeyed my voice, saith Jehovah.
024	JER	003	014	Return, ye rebellious children! saith Jehovah; Though I have rejected you, Yet will I receive you again, One from a city, and two from a nation, And I will bring you to Zion.
024	JER	003	015	And I will give you shepherds after my own heart, Who shall feed you with wisdom and discretion.
024	JER	003	016	And when ye shall have multiplied and increased in the land, saith Jehovah, Then shall ye no more speak of the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, Nor shall it come into your mind. None shall remember it; None shall care for it; It shall not be made any more.
024	JER	003	017	For then shall Jerusalem be called the throne of Jehovah, And all the nations shall resort to it; They shall resort to Jehovah, to Jerusalem, And shall no more walk after the perverseness of their evil hearts.
024	JER	003	018	In those days shall the house of Judah unite themselves with the house of Israel, And they shall come together from the north country, To the land which I caused your fathers to inherit.
024	JER	003	019	Then I said, how will I place thee among my children, And give thee a pleasant land, A goodly inheritance among the hosts of nations! And I said, Thou wilt call me thy father; Thou wilt not turn aside from following me.
024	JER	003	020	Yet as a woman is faithless to her husband, So have ye been faithless to me, O house of Israel! saith Jehovah.
024	JER	003	021	A voice is heard upon the hills, The weeping and supplications of the children of Israel! For they have perverted their way; They have forgotten Jehovah their God.
024	JER	003	022	Return, O revolted children! I will heal your rebellion. Behold, we come to thee, For thou art Jehovah our God!
024	JER	003	023	Truly in vain from the hills, In vain from the mountains do we seek abundance; Only from Jehovah our God cometh salvation for Israel.
024	JER	003	024	For the things of shame have devoured the substance of our fathers from our youth, Their sheep and their oxen, Their sons and their daughters.
024	JER	003	025	We lie down in our shame, And our ignominy covereth us; For we have sinned against Jehovah our God, We and our fathers, from our youth even to this day, And have not obeyed the voice of Jehovah our God.
024	JER	004	001	If thou wilt return to me, O Israel, saith Jehovah, Thou shalt return [[to thy land]]; If thou wilt put away thy abominations from my sight, Thou shalt no more be a wanderer [[in a foreign land]].
024	JER	004	002	If thou wilt swear, As Jehovah liveth! In truth, in justice, and in righteousness, Then shall the nations bless themselves by thee, And in thee shall they glory.
024	JER	004	003	Thus saith Jehovah to the men of Judah and Jerusalem: Break up your fallow ground, And sow not among thorns!
024	JER	004	004	Circumcise yourselves to Jehovah; Yea, circumcise your hearts, Ye men of Judah, and inhabitants of Jerusalem! Lest, for the evil of your doings, My fury break forth like fire, And burn so that none can quench it.
024	JER	004	005	Declare ye in Judah, And proclaim in Jerusalem, and say, Blow ye the trumpet in the land; Cry ye aloud, and say, Gather yourselves together, And let us go into the fortified cities;
024	JER	004	006	Set up a standard toward Zion, Flee, make no stand! For I am about to bring evil from the north, Even great destruction.
024	JER	004	007	The lion goeth up from his thicket, The destroyer of nations is on his way; He goeth forth from his place to make thy land desolate; Thy cities shall be laid waste so as to be without an inhabitant.
024	JER	004	008	For this cause gird on sackcloth, Lament and howl! For the fierce anger of Jehovah is not turned away from us.
024	JER	004	009	In that day, saith Jehovah, Shall the heart of the king perish, And the heart of the princes; The priests shall be amazed, And the prophets confounded.
024	JER	004	010	Then said I, Alas, O Lord Jehovah! Surely thou hast greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem; Thou hast said, “Ye shall have peace”; And the sword reacheth to the very life!
024	JER	004	011	At that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem: A dry wind cometh from the hills of the desert, It cometh toward my people, Not to fan, nor to cleanse.
024	JER	004	012	Yea, a wind stronger than this shall come; Now will I myself give sentence against them.
024	JER	004	013	Behold, he cometh up like clouds, And his chariots are like a whirlwind; His horses are swifter than eagles. Woe to us! for we are laid waste!
024	JER	004	014	Wash thy heart from wickedness, O Jerusalem, That thou mayst be saved! How long shall thy evil devices lodge within thee?
024	JER	004	015	For a voice proclaimeth tidings from Dan, And announceth calamity from mount Ephraim.
024	JER	004	016	Proclaim ye to the nations, Behold, publish ye to Jerusalem, “Watchmen are coming from a far country, And lift their voice against the cities of Judah.”
024	JER	004	017	Like keepers of fields are they round about her Because she hath rebelled against me, saith Jehovah.
024	JER	004	018	Thy way and thy doings have brought this upon thee; This is the fruit of thy wickedness; It is bitter; it reacheth to thy heart.
024	JER	004	019	O my breast, my breast! I am pained in the walls of my heart; My heart trembleth within me; I cannot be silent; For thou hearest, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet, The alarm of war!
024	JER	004	020	There is a cry of destruction upon destruction; Yea, the whole land is laid waste; Suddenly are my tents destroyed, And my canopies in an instant.
024	JER	004	021	How long shall I see the standard, Hear the sound of the trumpet?
024	JER	004	022	My people is foolish, They have no regard to me; Stupid children are they, And have no understanding; They are wise to do evil, But for doing good they have no knowledge.
024	JER	004	023	I look to the earth, and lo! emptiness and desolation; To the heavens, and there is no light.
024	JER	004	024	I look to the mountains, and lo! they tremble, And all the hills shake.
024	JER	004	025	I look, and lo! there is not a man, And all the birds of heaven are fled.
024	JER	004	026	I look, and lo! Carmel is a desert, And all its cities are thrown down, Before the presence of Jehovah, Before the heat of his anger.
024	JER	004	027	For thus saith Jehovah: The whole land shall be desolate, Yet will I not make a full end.
024	JER	004	028	Therefore shall the earth mourn, And the heavens above be black, Because I have spoken, and I will not repent; I have purposed, and I will not recede from it.
024	JER	004	029	At the noise of the horsemen and bowmen every city fleeth; They go into thickets, And climb up upon the rocks; All the cities are forsaken, And not a man dwelleth in them.
024	JER	004	030	And thou, destined to perish, what wilt thou do? Though thou clothe thyself in scarlet, And deck thyself with ornaments of gold, And rend thine eyes with paint, In vain dost thou adorn thyself; Thy lovers despise thee; They seek thy life.
024	JER	004	031	I hear a cry, as of a woman in travail, Anguish, as of her that bringeth forth her first child. The voice of the daughter of Zion. She sobbeth, she spreadeth out her hands, “Ah! woe is me! I am dying by murderers!”
024	JER	005	001	Run ye through the streets of Jerusalem, [[saith Jehovah, ]] And see now, and know, and seek in her broad places If ye can find a single man, If there be one that doeth justice, That seeketh uprightness, And I will forgive her.
024	JER	005	002	Yea, though they say, “As Jehovah liveth!” Yet do they swear falsely.
024	JER	005	003	Are not thine eyes upon the truth, O Jehovah! Thou hast smitten them, but they have not grieved; Thou hast consumed them, but they have refused to receive correction; They have made their faces harder than a rock; They have refused to return.
024	JER	005	004	Then I said, These are only the poor; They are foolish, because they know not the way of Jehovah, The law of their God.
024	JER	005	005	I will get me to the great ones, And I will speak to them; For they know the way of Jehovah, The law of their God. But these also have together broken the yoke; They have burst the bands.
024	JER	005	006	Therefore the lion out of the forest shall slay them, And the evening wolf shall destroy them. The leopard shall keep watch upon their cities; Every one that goeth out from them shall be torn in pieces; Because their transgressions are multiplied, Their rebellions are increased.
024	JER	005	007	How can I pardon thee for this? [[saith Jehovah; ]] Thy children have forsaken me, And sworn by them that are no gods. I have fed them to the full, yet do they commit adultery, And assemble themselves in crowds in the house of the harlot.
024	JER	005	008	They are as well-fed horses in the morning; Every one neigheth after his neighbor's wife.
024	JER	005	009	Shall I not punish for these things, saith Jehovah? Shall I not avenge myself on such a nation as this?
024	JER	005	010	Go ye up upon her walls and destroy! Yet make ye not a full end! Take ye away her branches, For they belong not to Jehovah!
024	JER	005	011	For they have proved false to me, The house of Israel and the house of Judah, saith Jehovah.
024	JER	005	012	They have denied Jehovah, And have said, “It is not He; Evil shall not come upon us, Nor shall we see sword or famine.
024	JER	005	013	The prophets are but wind, And the word is not in them; Thus may it happen to them!”
024	JER	005	014	Therefore thus saith Jehovah, God of hosts: Because ye say such things, Behold, I will make thy words in thy mouth fire, And this people wood, And it shall devour them.
024	JER	005	015	Behold, I will bring against you a nation from afar, O house of Israel, saith Jehovah; It is a mighty nation; It is an ancient nation; A nation whose language thou dost not know, And whose words thou canst not understand.
024	JER	005	016	Their quiver is like an open sepulchre; They are all mighty men.
024	JER	005	017	They shall consume thy harvest and thy bread; They shall consume thy sons and thy daughters; They shalt consume thy sheep and thy oxen; They shall consume thy vine and thy fig-tree; They shall destroy with the sword thy fortified cities, In which thou placest thy trust.
024	JER	005	018	Yet even in those days, saith Jehovah, I will not make a full end with you.
024	JER	005	019	And when they shall say, Wherefore hath Jehovah our God brought all these things upon us? Then shalt thou say to them, “As ye have forsaken me, And served strange gods in your land, So shall ye serve strangers in a land that is not yours.”
024	JER	005	020	Declare ye this in the house of Jacob, And publish it in Judah, saying:
024	JER	005	021	Hear ye now this, O foolish people and without understanding, Who have eyes and see not, Who have ears and hear not!
024	JER	005	022	Will ye not fear me, saith Jehovah? Will ye not tremble before me, Who appointed the sand a bound to the sea, A perpetual barrier, which it cannot pass? Though the waves thereof toss themselves, Yet do they not prevail, Though they roar, yet can they not pass over it.
024	JER	005	023	But this people hath a revolting and rebellious heart; They revolt continually.
024	JER	005	024	Neither say they in their heart, Let us now fear Jehovah our God, Who giveth rain, both the former and the latter, in its season, And secureth to us the appointed weeks of the harvest.
024	JER	005	025	Your iniquities have turned away these things, And your sins have withholden that which is good from you.
024	JER	005	026	For among my people are found wicked men, Who lie on the watch like fowlers; They set a trap that they may catch men.
024	JER	005	027	As a cage is full of birds, So are their houses full of fraud. Therefore are they grown great and rich;
024	JER	005	028	They have become fat and shine; Yea, they overpass the deeds of the wicked; They maintain no cause, No cause of the fatherless, and they prosper; And the right of the needy do they not defend.
024	JER	005	029	Shall I not punish for these things, saith Jehovah? Shall I not be avenged on such a nation as this?
024	JER	005	030	Astonishing and horrible is that which is done in this land;
024	JER	005	031	The prophets prophesy falsely, And the priests rule under their guidance, And my people love to have it so. But what will ye do in the end of it?
024	JER	006	001	Flee, O ye sons of Benjamin, from Jerusalem, And blow ye the trumpet in Tekoa, And lift up the banner in Beth-haccerem! For evil threateneth from the North; Yea, great destruction.
024	JER	006	002	O daughter of Zion, the comely and delicate, Thee have I doomed to destruction!
024	JER	006	003	The shepherds with their flocks shall come to her; They shall pitch their tents against her round about; They shall feed each one in his place.
024	JER	006	004	“Prepare ye war against her, [[shall they say; ]] Arise, and let us go up at noonday; Alas for us! for the day goeth away, For the shadows of evening are lengthened.
024	JER	006	005	Arise, and let us go up by night, And let us destroy her palaces!”
024	JER	006	006	For thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Hew ye down trees, And raise a mound against Jerusalem! She is a city to be punished; She is full of oppression.
024	JER	006	007	As a fountain sendeth forth its waters, So she sendeth forth her wickedness. Violence and rapine are heard within her; Before me continually are bruises and wounds.
024	JER	006	008	Receive correction, O Jerusalem, Lest my soul be alienated from thee, Lest I make thee a desolation, A land not inhabited!
024	JER	006	009	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: They shall thoroughly glean the remnant of Israel as a vine; Turn thy hand like a grape-gatherer again to the baskets!
024	JER	006	010	To whom shall I speak? To whom give warning, so that they shall hear? Behold, their ear is uncircumcised, so that they cannot hearken; Behold, the word of Jehovah is to them a derision; They have no delight in it.
024	JER	006	011	Therefore I am full of the fury of Jehovah; I am weary of holding it; I will pour it out alike upon the children in the street, And upon the assembly of the young men. Yea, also the husband with the wife shall be taken, The old man, and he that is full of days.
024	JER	006	012	Their houses also shall be transferred to others, Their fields and their wives together, For I will stretch out my hand over the inhabitants of the land, saith Jehovah.
024	JER	006	013	For from the least of them even to the greatest, Every one is greedy of gain; Prophet and priest alike, Every one of them practiseth deceit.
024	JER	006	014	They heal the wound of my people slightly, Saying, Peace! peace! when there is no peace.
024	JER	006	015	Are they ashamed that they have done abominable things? Nay, they are not at all ashamed; They know not how to blush; Therefore shall they fall with them that fall; At the time when I punish them, They shall be cast down, saith Jehovah.
024	JER	006	016	Thus saith Jehovah: Stand ye upon the ways and look; And ask for the old paths, “Where is the good way?” Walk ye in it, and ye shall find for yourselves rest. But they say, We will not walk in it.
024	JER	006	017	I have also set watchmen over you, [[saying, ]] Hearken to the sound of the trumpet! But they say, We will not hearken.
024	JER	006	018	Therefore hear, O ye nations, And know, ye assembled multitude, What shall come upon them!
024	JER	006	019	Hear thou, O earth! Behold, I bring evil upon this people, The fruit of their devices; Because they have not hearkened to my words, And have even rejected my law.
024	JER	006	020	To what purpose is incense brought to me from Sheba, And the sweet-smelling reed from a far country? Your burnt-offerings are not acceptable, Nor are your sacrifices sweet to me.
024	JER	006	021	Therefore thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I lay stumbling-blocks before this people, Upon which fathers and sons shall stumble together, The neighbor and his friend, and shall perish.
024	JER	006	022	Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, a people cometh from the land of the North; A great nation riseth up from the extremities of the earth.
024	JER	006	023	They bear the bow and the spear; They are cruel and show no mercy; Their voice roareth like the sea; And upon horses do they ride, Arrayed as a warrior against thee, O daughter of Zion.
024	JER	006	024	We have heard the report thereof; Our hands lose their strength; Anguish hath taken hold of us, Pain, as of a woman in travail.
024	JER	006	025	Go not forth into the field, Nor walk ye in the highway! For the sword of the enemy And terror are on every side.
024	JER	006	026	O daughter of my people, gird thee with sackcloth, And roll thyself in ashes! Make thee mourning as for an only son, Most bitter lamentation! For suddenly shall the spoiler come upon us.
024	JER	006	027	I have set thee, like a tower, for an assayer among my people, That thou mayst know and try their way.
024	JER	006	028	They are all stubborn revolters, Slanderers are they, brass and iron; They are all corrupt.
024	JER	006	029	The bellows burn; The lead is consumed by the fire; The refiner hath melted in vain, For the bad are not separated.
024	JER	006	030	Rejected silver shall men call them, Because Jehovah hath rejected them.
024	JER	007	001	The word which came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying:
024	JER	007	002	Stand in the gate of the house of Jehovah, and proclaim these words, and say: —Hear the word of Jehovah, all ye of Judah, Who enter in at these gates to worship Jehovah!
024	JER	007	003	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Amend your ways and your doings, And I will suffer you to dwell in this place!
024	JER	007	004	Trust ye not in lying words, when they say, “The temple of Jehovah, the temple of Jehovah, The temple of Jehovah are these.”
024	JER	007	005	Yet if ye will thoroughly amend your ways and your doings, And dispense justice between man and man,
024	JER	007	006	If ye oppress not the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, And shed not innocent blood in this place, And go not after other gods to your own hurt,
024	JER	007	007	Then will I cause you to dwell in this place, In the land which I gave to your fathers, For ever and ever.
024	JER	007	008	Behold, ye trust in lying words without profit.
024	JER	007	009	Ye steal, and murder, and commit adultery, And swear falsely, and burn incense to Baal, And go after strange gods, which ye know not,
024	JER	007	010	And then come and stand before me in this house, Which is called by my name, And say, “We are delivered!” Whilst ye practise all these abominations.
024	JER	007	011	Is this house, which is called by my name, Become a den for robbers in your eyes? Behold, I myself have seen it, saith Jehovah.
024	JER	007	012	But go now to my place, which was in Shiloh, Where I caused my name to dwell at the first, And see what I have done to it On account of the wickedness of my people Israel.
024	JER	007	013	And now because ye have done all these works, saith Jehovah, And I have spoken to you, rising early and speaking, But ye hearkened not, And I have called to you, But ye answered not,
024	JER	007	014	Therefore will I do to the house which is called by my name, In which ye place your confidence, And to the place which I gave to you and to your fathers, As I have done to Shiloh.
024	JER	007	015	I will cast you out from my presence, As I have cast out all your brethren, The whole race of Ephraim.
024	JER	007	016	And as for thee, pray not for this people, Nor lift up a cry or a prayer for them, Nor make intercession to me for them; For I will not hear thee.
024	JER	007	017	Seest thou not what they do In the cities of Judah, and the streets of Jerusalem?
024	JER	007	018	The sons gather the wood, And the fathers kindle the fire, And the women knead dough, To make cakes for the queen of heaven, And to pour out libations to strange gods, That they may vex me.
024	JER	007	019	But do they vex me, saith Jehovah? Do they not rather vex themselves, to the confusion of their own faces?
024	JER	007	020	Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold my anger and my fury shall be poured out on this place, Upon man and upon beast; Upon the trees of the field, And upon the fruit of the ground; It shall burn and not be quenched.
024	JER	007	021	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Add your burnt-offerings to your sacrifices, And eat ye the flesh.
024	JER	007	022	For I spake not to your fathers, nor commanded them Concerning burnt-offerings and sacrifices, At the time when I brought them out of the land of Egypt;
024	JER	007	023	But this command gave I to them: “Hearken,” said I, “to my voice, And I will be your God, And ye shall be my people. And walk ye in all the ways which I command you, That it may go well with you.”
024	JER	007	024	But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear, But walked in the devices and obstinacy of their evil heart, Turning their backs and not their faces toward me.
024	JER	007	025	From the day when your fathers came forth from the land of Egypt, Even to this day, I have also sent to you all my servants, the prophets, Daily rising early and sending.
024	JER	007	026	But they have not hearkened to me, Nor have they inclined their ear; But they have hardened their neck, And acted more wickedly than their fathers.
024	JER	007	027	And when thou shalt speak all these things to them, They will not hearken to thee; And when thou shalt call to them, They will make thee no answer.
024	JER	007	028	Therefore shalt thou say to them, This is the nation that hearkeneth not to the voice of Jehovah their God, And taketh no correction; Truth hath failed, and is cut off from their mouth.
024	JER	007	029	Cut off thy locks, O Jerusalem, and cast them away! Set up a lamentation upon the high place! For Jehovah hath rejected and forsaken the children Against which his wrath hath been kindled.
024	JER	007	030	For the children of Judah have done evil in my sight, saith Jehovah, They have set their abominations in the house Which is called by my name, to pollute it.
024	JER	007	031	They have built the high places of Tophet, Which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, To burn their sons and their daughters in the fire, Which I commanded not, Which even came not into my mind.
024	JER	007	032	Therefore behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, That it shall no more be called Tophet, Or the valley of the son of Hinnom, But the Valley of Slaughter; For they shall bury in Tophet till there be no room left.
024	JER	007	033	And the dead bodies of this people shall be for meat To the birds of the air and to the beasts of the earth; And none shall scare them away.
024	JER	007	034	And I will cause to cease from the cities of Judah, And from the streets of Jerusalem, The voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, The voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride; For the land shall be desolate.
024	JER	008	001	At that time, saith Jehovah, Shall the bones of the kings of Judah, and the bones of the princes, The bones of the priests, and the bones of the prophets, And the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Be cast forth from their graves;
024	JER	008	002	And they shall be spread before the sun, and the moon, and all the host of heaven, Which they have loved, and which they have served, and after which they have walked; Which they have consulted and have worshipped; They shall not be gathered, nor be buried; They shall be as dung upon the face of the ground.
024	JER	008	003	And death shall be chosen rather than life By all the residue of them that remain of this evil race, Which remain in all the places whither I have driver them, Saith Jehovah of hosts.
024	JER	008	004	Thou shalt also say to them, Thus saith Jehovah, Doth a man fall, and not rise again? Doth one turn aside from the way, and not return,
024	JER	008	005	Why then hath this people, Why hath Jerusalem, completely revolted? They hold fast deceit; They refuse to return.
024	JER	008	006	I have listened and heard, But they speak not aright; No one repenteth of his wickedness, Saying, “What have I done?” Every one runneth at full speed in his rebellion, As a horse rusheth to the battle.
024	JER	008	007	Even the stork in the heavens knoweth her times, And the turtle-dove and the swallow and the crane observe the season of their coming, But my people regard not the laws of Jehovah.
024	JER	008	008	How is it that ye say, “We are wise, We possess the law of Jehovah”? Behold, the false pen of the scribes Hath turned it into falsehood.
024	JER	008	009	The wise men shall be confounded; They shall be dismayed and ensnared; Behold, they have rejected the word of Jehovah, And what wisdom is there in them?
024	JER	008	010	Therefore will I give their wives to others, And their fields to plunderers. For from the least of them even to the greatest, Every one is greedy of gain, Prophet and priest alike, Every one of them practiseth deceit.
024	JER	008	011	They heal the wound of my people slightly, Saying, Peace! peace! when there is no peace.
024	JER	008	012	Are they ashamed, that they have done abominable things? Nay, they are not at all ashamed; They know not how to blush. Therefore shall they fall with them that fall; At the time when I punish them, They shall be cast down, saith Jehovah.
024	JER	008	013	I will utterly consume them, saith Jehovah; There shall be no grapes on the vine, Nor shall there be from the fig-tree; Even the leaf shall be withered; For I will send those that shall overrun them.
024	JER	008	014	“Why do we remain here?” [[shall they say.]] “Assemble yourselves and let us go into the fortified cities. And let us there wait in silence! For Jehovah our God hath put us to silence, And given us the water of hemlock to drink, Because we have sinned against Jehovah.
024	JER	008	015	We look for peace, but no good cometh; For a time of deliverance, and behold, terror!”
024	JER	008	016	From Dan is heard the snorting of their horses, At the sound of the neighing of their steeds the whole land trembleth; They come and devour the land, and all that is in it; The city, and them that dwell therein.
024	JER	008	017	Behold I send against you serpents, Basilisks, which cannot be charmed, And they shall bite you, saith Jehovah.
024	JER	008	018	O where is consolation for my sorrow! My heart is faint within me.
024	JER	008	019	Behold, the cry of the daughter of my people from a far country! “Is not Jehovah in Zion? Is her King there no more?” Why then have they provoked me by their graven images, And their foreign vanities?
024	JER	008	020	The harvest is passed, the summer is ended, And we are not delivered.
024	JER	008	021	For the wound of the daughter of my people am I wounded; I mourn; amazement hath taken hold of me.
024	JER	008	022	Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no physician there? Why then are not the wounds of my people healed?
024	JER	009	001	O that my head were waters, And mine eyes a fountain of tears, That I might weep day and night For the slain of the daughter of my people!
024	JER	009	002	O that I had a traveller's lodge in the wilderness, That I might leave my people, and go from them! For they are all adulterers; An assembly of revolters.
024	JER	009	003	They bend their tongues, like their bows, for lies, And not by truth do they grow mighty in the earth; They proceed from wickedness to wickedness, And have no regard to me, saith Jehovah.
024	JER	009	004	Be on your guard each one against his neighbor, And trust ye not in any brother; For every brother will supplant, And every neighbor will slander.
024	JER	009	005	They deceive every one his neighbor, And do not speak the truth; They have accustomed their tongues to speak lies; They weary themselves in doing iniquity.
024	JER	009	006	Thy habitation is in the midst of deceit, [[O prophet!]] Through deceit they refuse to know me, saith Jehovah.
024	JER	009	007	Therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Behold I will melt them and try them; For what else can I do on account of the daughter of my people?
024	JER	009	008	Their tongue is a deadly arrow; Every one of them speaketh treachery; With their mouth they speak peace to their neighbor, But in their heart they lay snares for him.
024	JER	009	009	Shall I not punish them for these things? saith Jehovah; Shall I not be avenged on such a nation as this?
024	JER	009	010	For the mountains will I lift up a weeping and wailing, And for the pastures of the plains a lamentation, For they are burned up, so that none can pass through them; No more is heard the voice of the cattle; Both the birds of the heavens and the beasts have fled, and are gone.
024	JER	009	011	I will make Jerusalem heaps of stones, The dwelling-place of jackals; And I will make the cities of Judah desolate, without an inhabitant.
024	JER	009	012	Who is the wise man, that he may understand this, And he to whom the mouth of the Lord hath spoken, that he may declare it? Why is it that the land perisheth, That it is burned up like a desert, which none passeth through?
024	JER	009	013	Jehovah himself hath said: It is because they have forsaken my law, Which I set before them, And have not hearkened to my voice, Nor walked according to it;
024	JER	009	014	But have walked after the obstinacy of their own heart, And after the Baals, as their fathers taught them.
024	JER	009	015	Therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will feed this people with wormwood, And give them water of hemlock to drink.
024	JER	009	016	I will also scatter them among nations Which neither they nor their fathers have known, And I will send after them the sword, Till I have made an end of them.
024	JER	009	017	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Consider ye, and call for the mourning women, that they may come, And send to the skilful ones, that they may come;
024	JER	009	018	Let them make haste, and lift up a wailing for us, That our eyes may run down with tears, And our eyelids gush forth with waters.
024	JER	009	019	Behold, a voice of wailing is heard from Zion: “How are we spoiled! How are we put to shame! We must leave our native land; They have cast down our habitations.”
024	JER	009	020	Hear, O ye women, the word of Jehovah! Let your ear receive the word of his mouth! Teach your daughters a lamentation, And every one her companion a mournful dirge!
024	JER	009	021	For death cometh in through our windows, It entereth our palaces; It cutteth off the children from the street, And the young men from the public places.
024	JER	009	022	Declare it, saith Jehovah! The dead bodies of men shall fall as dung upon the open field, And as the handful behind the reaper, Which none gathereth up.
024	JER	009	023	Thus saith Jehovah: Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, Nor let the mighty glory in his might, Nor let the rich glory in his riches!
024	JER	009	024	But let him that glorieth glory in this, That he hath regard to me, and knoweth me, That I am Jehovah, who exercise loving-kindness, Justice, and righteousness upon the earth; For in these do I delight, saith Jehovah.
024	JER	009	025	Behold the days come, saith Jehovah, That I will punish all the circumcised with the uncircumcised,
024	JER	009	026	Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, And the sons of Ammon and Moab, And all with shaven cheeks, that dwell in the wilderness. For all the nations are uncircumcised, And all the house of Israel is uncircumcised in heart.
024	JER	010	001	Hear ye the word which Jehovah speaketh to you, O house of Israel!
024	JER	010	002	Thus saith Jehovah: Conform ye not to the way of the heathen, And be not dismayed at the signs of the heavens, Because the heathen are dismayed at them!
024	JER	010	003	The customs of the nations are vanity. For a tree of the wood is cut down, It is wrought by the hands of the artificer with the axe,
024	JER	010	004	It is decked with silver and gold, And with nails and with hammers is it fastened, That it may not totter.
024	JER	010	005	They are like a turned palm-tree pillar, and cannot speak; They must be borne by men, for they cannot walk. Be not afraid of them, for they cannot hurt, Nor is it in their power to do good.
024	JER	010	006	There is none like thee, O Jehovah! Thou art great, And great is thy name by mighty deeds.
024	JER	010	007	Who shall not fear thee, O king of nations, For to thee doth it belong! For among all the wise men of the nations, And in all their kingdoms, there is none like thee.
024	JER	010	008	They are all brutish and without understanding; A doctrine of vanities is the stock.
024	JER	010	009	Beaten silver is brought from Tarshish, And gold from Uphaz, The work of the artificer and the founder; Blue and purple is their clothing; The work of the skilful is it all.
024	JER	010	010	But Jehovah is the true God, He is the living God, and an everlasting king; At his wrath the earth trembleth, And the nations are not able to abide his indignation.
024	JER	010	011	[[Thus shall ye say to them: The gods, that have not made the heavens and the earth, Shall perish from the earth and from under these heavens.]]
024	JER	010	012	He made the earth by his power; He established the world by his wisdom, And by his understanding he spread out the heavens.
024	JER	010	013	When he uttereth his voice there is an abundance of water in the heavens; He causeth clouds to ascend from the ends of the earth; He maketh lightnings with rain; He bringeth the wind from his storehouses.
024	JER	010	014	Brutish is every one who hath not this knowledge; By his image is every founder put to shame, For his molten-work is deceit; There is no breath in it.
024	JER	010	015	They are vanity, deceptive work; In the time of their punishment shall they perish.
024	JER	010	016	Not like them is He who is the portion of Jacob; He is the former of all things, And Israel is his allotted inheritance; Jehovah of hosts is his name.
024	JER	010	017	Gather up thy goods out of the land, O inhabitant of the fortress!
024	JER	010	018	For thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will sling forth the inhabitants of the land at this time; I will distress them, so that they shall be taken.
024	JER	010	019	“Ah me! my wound!” [[saith the daughter of Zion; ]] “My bruise is deadly; Yet I say, This is my affliction, and I must bear it!
024	JER	010	020	My tent is torn down, And all my cords broken. My children are gone forth from me, and are no more; There is none to stretch forth my tent any more, Or to set up my curtains.
024	JER	010	021	For the shepherds have become brutish; They have not sought Jehovah; Therefore have they not prospered, And all their flock is dispersed.”
024	JER	010	022	[[Hark!]] the sound of tiding! Behold it cometh, And a great tumult from the land of the North, To make the cities of Judah desolate, A dwelling-place for jackals.
024	JER	010	023	“I know, O Jehovah, that the way of a man is not within his power, That it is not within the power of a man that walketh to establish his steps.
024	JER	010	024	Chasten me, O Jehovah, but in measure; Not in thine anger, lest thou bring me to nothing!
024	JER	010	025	Pour out thy wrath on the nations which acknowledge thee not, And on the kingdoms which call not on thy name! For they have devoured Jacob; They have devoured and consumed him, And laid waste his dwelling-place.”
024	JER	011	001	The word which came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying:
024	JER	011	002	Hear ye the words of this covenant, And speak ye to the men of Judah, And the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
024	JER	011	003	And say thou to them, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: Cursed is the man who will not obey the words of this covenant,
024	JER	011	004	Which I commanded your fathers, When I brought them forth from the land of Egypt, From the iron furnace, saying, “Obey ye my voice, And do all which I command you; So shall ye be my people, And I will be your God;
024	JER	011	005	So that I may perform the oath, Which I made to your fathers, To give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as it is this day.” Then answered I, and said, So may it be, O Jehovah!
024	JER	011	006	Then said Jehovah to me, Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah, And the streets of Jerusalem, saying: Hear ye the words of this covenant, and do them!
024	JER	011	007	For I have earnestly admonished your fathers, From the time when I brought them up from the land of Egypt to this day, Rising early and admonishing them, saying, “Obey ye my voice!”
024	JER	011	008	Yet they obeyed not, nor inclined their ear, But walked every one in the obstinacy of his evil heart; Therefore have I brought upon them all the words of this covenant, Which I commanded them to obey, And they obeyed not.
024	JER	011	009	Jehovah also said to me: A conspiracy hath been found among the men of Judah, And the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
024	JER	011	010	They turn back to the iniquities of their forefathers, Who refused to hearken to my words; They go after strange gods and serve them; The house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken the covenant Which I made with their fathers.
024	JER	011	011	Therefore thus saith Jehovah: Behold I bring upon them a calamity, From which they shall not be able to escape; And though they cry to me, I will not hear them.
024	JER	011	012	Then may the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem go, And cry to the gods to whom they burn incense; But they shall not save them at all in the time of their calamity.
024	JER	011	013	For according to the number of thy cities are thy gods, O Judah! According to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have ye set up altars to a thing of shame, Altars for burning incense to Baal.
024	JER	011	014	Therefore pray not thou for this people, Nor lift up a cry or a prayer for them; For I will not hear when they cry to me On account of their calamity.
024	JER	011	015	What hath my beloved to do in my house, While many pollute it with wickedness? The holy flesh shall pass away from thee, For when thou doest evil, thou rejoicest.
024	JER	011	016	Jehovah hath called thee an olive-tree, Green, fair, and of goodly fruit; With the noise of a great crackling doth he kindle a fire upon it, And the branches of it shall be broken.
024	JER	011	017	For Jehovah of hosts, who planted thee, Hath pronounced evil against thee, On account of the wickedness of the house of Israel and of Judah, which they have committed In provoking me to anger by burning incense to Baal.
024	JER	011	018	Jehovah made it known to me, and I knew it; Thou didst show me their machinations!
024	JER	011	019	For I was like a tame lamb, that is led to the slaughter, And knew not that they had formed plots against me, [[saying, ]] “Let us destroy the tree with its fruit, Let us cut him off from the land of the living, That his name may no more be remembered!”
024	JER	011	020	But, O Jehovah of hosts, the righteous judge, Who triest the reins and the heart, I shall see thy vengeance on them, For to thee have I revealed my cause!
024	JER	011	021	Therefore thus saith Jehovah against the men of Anathoth, Who seek thy life, and say, “Prophesy not in the name of Jehovah, Lest thou die by our hand!”
024	JER	011	022	Therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Behold, I will punish them; Their young men shall die by the sword; Their sons and their daughters shall die by famine,
024	JER	011	023	There shall be none of them left; For I will bring evil upon the men of Anathoth, At the time of their punishment.
024	JER	012	001	Righteous art thou, O Jehovah, when I contend with thee, Yet will I enter into controversy with thee. Why doth the way of the wicked prosper? Why are all the men of treachery at ease?
024	JER	012	002	Thou hast planted them; yea, they have taken root; They grow, yea, they bring forth fruit; Thou art near to their mouth, But far from their hearts.
024	JER	012	003	But thou, O Jehovah, knowest me; Thou hast seen me, and tried my heart, Whether it be devoted to thee. Tear them away, as sheep for slaughter; Separate them for the day of slaughter!
024	JER	012	004	How long shall the land mourn, And the grass of every field wither? For the wickedness of them that dwell therein, The beasts are consumed, and the birds; For they say, “He will not see our latter end.”
024	JER	012	005	If thou hast run with footmen, and they have wearied thee, Then how canst thou contend with horses? If it be so with thee in a land of peace, in which thou art secure, What wilt thou do in the glory of Jordan?
024	JER	012	006	For even thy brethren and the house of thy father, Even these are treacherous toward thee, And raise a full cry after thee; Trust them not, though they speak fair words to thee!
024	JER	012	007	I have forsaken my house, I have abandoned my inheritance, I have given the darling of my soul into the hand of her enemies.
024	JER	012	008	My inheritance is become to me like a lion of the forest; She lifteth up her voice against me; Therefore do I hate her.
024	JER	012	009	A rapacious beast, a hyena, is my inheritance become to me; Therefore shall the rapacious beasts rush upon her on all sides. Come, gather all the beasts of the field, Bring them to devour!
024	JER	012	010	Many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard; They have trodden my portion under foot; My pleasant portion have they made a desolate wilderness.
024	JER	012	011	They have made it a desolation; Desolate it mourneth on account of me; The whole land is desolate, Because no man layeth my word to heart.
024	JER	012	012	Upon all the high places in the desert do the plunderers come; Behold, the sword of Jehovah devoureth from one end of the land to the other; No man hath peace.
024	JER	012	013	They sow wheat, but they reap thorns; They weary themselves, and are not profited; They shall be ashamed of their harvest, Because of the fierce anger of Jehovah.
024	JER	012	014	Thus saith Jehovah against all my evil neighbors, Who seize the inheritance which I gave my people, Israel: Behold, I will pluck them out of their land, And the house of Judah will I pluck out from among them.
024	JER	012	015	Yet after I have plucked them out of their land, I will again have compassion on them, and bring them back, Every one to his own possession, And every one to his own land.
024	JER	012	016	And if they will indeed learn the ways of my people, And swear by my name, saying, As Jehovah liveth! As they taught my people to swear by Baal, Then shall they be built up in the midst of my people;
024	JER	012	017	But if they will not hearken, I will utterly pluck up and destroy that nation, saith Jehovah.
024	JER	013	001	Thus saith Jehovah to me: Go and get thee a linen girdle, and put it on thy loins, and put it not into water!
024	JER	013	002	So I got a girdle according to the word of Jehovah, and put it on my loins.
024	JER	013	003	Then the word of Jehovah came to me the second time, saying,
024	JER	013	004	Take the girdle which thou hast gotten, which is upon thy loins, and arise, go to the Euphrates, and hide it there in a hole of the rock.
024	JER	013	005	So I went and hid it near the Euphrates, as Jehovah commanded me.
024	JER	013	006	And after many days Jehovah said to me. Arise, go to the Euphrates, and take thence the girdle which I commanded thee to hide there.
024	JER	013	007	Then I went to the Euphrates, and digged, and took the girdle from the place where I had hidden it; and, behold, the girdle was marred, so that it was good for nothing.
024	JER	013	008	Then the word of Jehovah came to me, saying: —
024	JER	013	009	Thus saith Jehovah: After this manner will I mar the pride of Judah, And the great pride of Jerusalem.
024	JER	013	010	This evil people, Who refuse to hearken to my words, Who walk after the obstinacy of their heart, And walk after strange gods, To serve them and to worship them, Shall be like this girdle, Which is good for nothing.
024	JER	013	011	For as a girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man, So have I caused to cleave to me the whole house of Israel, And the whole house of Judah, saith Jehovah, That they might be to me a people, And a name, and a praise, and a glory; But they hearkened not to me.
024	JER	013	012	Then shalt thou speak to them in this manner. Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: Every flagon shall be filled with wine. And they will say to thee, “Do we not know that every flagon shall be filled with wine?”
024	JER	013	013	Then shalt thou say to them, Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will fill all the inhabitants of this land, And the kings that sit upon David's throne, And the priests, and the prophets, And all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with drunkenness.
024	JER	013	014	And I will dash them one against another, Even fathers and children together, saith Jehovah; I will not pity, nor spare, Nor show mercy, so as not to destroy them.
024	JER	013	015	Hear ye, and attend! be not lifted up! For Jehovah speaketh.
024	JER	013	016	Give glory to Jehovah, your God, Before he bring darkness, And your feet stumble upon the dark mountains, And, while ye look for light, He turn it into deathlike shade, And make it gross darkness.
024	JER	013	017	But if ye will not hear, I will mourn in secret places for your pride, I will weep continually, And my eyes shall run down with tears, Because the flock of Jehovah is carried away captive.
024	JER	013	018	Say to the king and to the queen, Sit ye down upon the ground, For your beautiful crown shall fall from your heads.
024	JER	013	019	The cities of the South are shut up, and none openeth them; Judah is carried away captive, all of it, Every man of it is carried away captive.
024	JER	013	020	Lift up your eyes, and behold them that come from the North! Where is the flock that was given thee, thy beautiful flock?
024	JER	013	021	What wilt thou say when he shall punish thee? For thou thyself hast taught them to be lords over thee. Shall not sorrows seize thee, as a woman in travail?
024	JER	013	022	And if thou say in thine heart, “Wherefore are these things coming upon me?” For the greatness of thy iniquity are thy skirts uncovered, And thy heels made bare.
024	JER	013	023	Can the Ethiopian change his skin, Or the leopard his spots? Then may ye also do good, Who have been accustomed to do evil.
024	JER	013	024	Therefore will I scatter you like stubble, Which passeth away before the wind of the desert.
024	JER	013	025	This is thy lot, The portion measured out for thee by me, saith Jehovah, Because thou hast forgotten me, and trusted in falsehood.
024	JER	013	026	Therefore will I lift up thy skirts over thy head, So that thy shame shall be seen.
024	JER	013	027	Thine adulteries, thy neighings, The lewdness of thy whoredom on the hills, in the fields, All thy abominations, have I seen. Woe to thee, O Jerusalem! How long ere thou wilt become pure!
024	JER	014	001	The word of Jehovah, which came to Jeremiah concerning a drought.
024	JER	014	002	Judah mourneth, And the gates thereof languish; They are in deep mourning upon the ground. And the cry of Jerusalem goeth up.
024	JER	014	003	The nobles send their younger ones for water; They come to the wells, they find none; They return with their vessels empty; They are ashamed and confounded; They cover their heads.
024	JER	014	004	Because of the ground, which is in consternation, No rain falling upon the earth, The husbandmen are ashamed, They hide their heads.
024	JER	014	005	Even the hind in the field is delivered, And deserteth her young, Because there is no grass.
024	JER	014	006	The wild asses stand upon the hills, They snuff up the wind like jackals; Their eyes fail, Because there is no grass.
024	JER	014	007	Though our iniquities testify against us, Yet do thou, O Jehovah, act from a regard to thine own name. For our transgressions have been many; We have sinned against thee.
024	JER	014	008	O thou hope of Israel, His saviour in the time of trouble, Why wilt thou be as a stranger in the land, As a traveller who spreadeth his tent to pass the night?
024	JER	014	009	Why wilt thou be as a man that is amazed, As a hero that cannot save? Thou art in the midst of us, O Jehovah, And we are called by thy name; Do not forsake us!
024	JER	014	010	Thus saith Jehovah concerning this people: Thus they love to wander, They restrain not their feet; Therefore Jehovah doth not accept them; Now will he remember their iniquities, And punish their sins.
024	JER	014	011	Then said Jehovah to me: Pray not for this people for their good!
024	JER	014	012	Though they fast, I will not hear their cry; Though they offer burnt-offerings and flour-offerings, I will not accept them; But by the sword, and by famine, and by pestilence, I will make an end of them.
024	JER	014	013	Then said I, Alas! O Lord Jehovah! Behold, the prophets say to them, “Ye shall not see the sword, Nor shall famine come upon you; But Jehovah will give you lasting peace in this place.”
024	JER	014	014	Then said Jehovah to me: The prophets prophesy lies in my name; I have not sent them, nor commissioned them, nor spoken to them; A false vision, and divination, and vanity, And the fraud of their hearts, do they prophesy to you.
024	JER	014	015	Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning the prophets Who prophesy in my name, though I sent them not, But who themselves say, “The sword and famine shall not be in this land”: By the sword and by famine shall those prophets be consumed.
024	JER	014	016	And the people to whom they prophesy Shall be cast forth in the streets of Jerusalem By means of famine and the sword; And they shall have none to bury them, —They, their wives, and their sons, and their daughters; For I will pour their wickedness upon them.
024	JER	014	017	Thus also shalt thou speak to them: My eyes shall run down with tears night and day; They shall not cease; For a deep wound hath she received, The virgin daughter of my people, A deadly blow.
024	JER	014	018	If I go forth into the fields, Then behold them that are slain by the sword! And if I enter the city, Then behold them that pine with famine! Both prophet and priest wander about the land, they know not whither.
024	JER	014	019	Hast thou utterly rejected Judah? Doth thy soul abhor Zion? Why hast thou smitten us, so that there is no healing for us! We look for peace, and there is no good, For a time of healing, and behold, terror!
024	JER	014	020	We acknowledge, O Jehovah, our wickedness, And the iniquity of our fathers; For we have sinned against thee.
024	JER	014	021	Do not spurn us, for thy name's sake! Do not dishonor thy glorious throne! Call to mind, break not, thy covenant with us!
024	JER	014	022	Are there among the vanities of the nations any that can cause rain? Or can the heavens give showers? Art not thou he, O Jehovah, our God? Therefore in thee will we trust, For thou hast made all these things!
024	JER	015	001	Then said Jehovah to me: Though Moses and Samuel should stand before me, Yet would I not be reconciled to this people. Send them out of my sight, and let them go forth!
024	JER	015	002	And if they say to thee, “Whither shall we go forth?” Then say thou to them, Thus saith Jehovah: They that are for the pestilence, to the pestilence, And they that are for the sword, to the sword. And they that are for famine, to famine, And they that are for captivity, to captivity.
024	JER	015	003	I will commission against them four woes, saith Jehovah! The sword to slay, And the dogs to drag about, And the birds of heaven, and the beasts of the earth, To devour and destroy.
024	JER	015	004	I will cause them to be harassed in all the kingdoms of the earth, On account of Manasseh, the son of Hezekiah, king of Judah, On account of all which he did in Jerusalem.
024	JER	015	005	For who will have pity on thee, O Jerusalem? Or who condole with thee? Or who turn aside to ask thee of thy welfare?
024	JER	015	006	Thou hast forsaken me, saith Jehovah; Thou hast gone backward; Therefore will I stretch out my hand against thee, and destroy thee; I am weary of relenting.
024	JER	015	007	I will scatter them with a winnowing-fan through the gates of the land; I will bereave them of their sons; I will destroy my people, Since they return not from their ways.
024	JER	015	008	Their widows shall be more numerous than the sand of the sea; Against the mother of the young men do I bring a spoiler at noonday; Suddenly will I bring alarm and terrors upon them.
024	JER	015	009	She, that hath borne seven, languisheth; She is ready to expire; Her sun goeth down while it is yet day; She is ashamed and confounded. Their remnant will I also give to the sword Before their enemies, saith Jehovah.
024	JER	015	010	Alas for me, my mother, that thou hast borne me, To live in strife and contention with all the land! I have neither borrowed nor lent money, Yet doth every one curse me!
024	JER	015	011	Jehovah said: Surely I will deliver and prosper thee, Surely, in the time of trouble and in the time of distress, Will I cause the adversary to be a suppliant to thee.
024	JER	015	012	Who is able to break iron, Iron from the North, and brass?
024	JER	015	013	Thy substance and thy treasures will I give for spoil, without price, On account of all thy sins in all thy borders.
024	JER	015	014	I will cause them to pass with thy enemies into a land which thou knowest not; For a fire is kindled in my anger, which shall burn against you.
024	JER	015	015	Thou, O Jehovah, knowest all my concerns! O remember me, and have regard to me, And revenge me of my persecutors! Do not, through thy long-suffering, take me away! Consider that for thy sake I have suffered rebuke!
024	JER	015	016	As soon as I found thy words, I devoured them; For thy words were the joy and rejoicing of my heart; For I am called by thy name, O Jehovah, God of hosts!
024	JER	015	017	I have not sat in the assembly of them that made merry, nor rejoiced; On account of thy hand I have sat alone; For thou hast filled me with indignation.
024	JER	015	018	Why is my pain perpetual, And my wound mortal, refusing to be healed? Thou hast been to me like a deceitful stream; Like waters that fail.
024	JER	015	019	Then answered Jehovah thus: If thou wilt return, then will I restore thee, and thou shalt stand before me; And if thou wilt separate the precious from the vile, Thou shalt be as my mouth. They shall turn to thee, And thou shalt not turn to them.
024	JER	015	020	I will make thee against this people a strong wall of brass; When they war against thee, they shall not prevail against thee, For I will be with thee to save thee, And to deliver thee, saith Jehovah.
024	JER	015	021	I will rescue thee from the hand of the wicked, And I will redeem thee from the grasp of the violent.
024	JER	016	001	The word of Jehovah came to me, saying:
024	JER	016	002	Take thee not a wife; Have no sons or daughters in this place!
024	JER	016	003	For thus saith Jehovah concerning the sons and the daughters That are born in this place, And concerning their mothers that bore them, And concerning their fathers that begat them in this land;
024	JER	016	004	By deadly diseases shall they die; They shall not be lamented nor buried; They shall become dung upon the face of the earth; By the sword also and by famine shall they be consumed, And their carcasses shall be food for the birds of heaven And the beasts of the earth.
024	JER	016	005	For thus saith Jehovah: Enter not into the house of wailing; Go not to lament; Comfort them not! For I have taken away my peace from this people, saith Jehovah, My kindness and mercy.
024	JER	016	006	The great and the small in this land shall die; They shall not be buried nor lamented; No one shall cut himself for them, Nor shall any one make himself bald for them.
024	JER	016	007	Men shall not break bread for them in their grief, To comfort them for the dead, Nor give them the cup of consolation to drink, On account of a lost father or mother.
024	JER	016	008	Neither enter thou into the house of feasting, To sit down with them to eat and to drink!
024	JER	016	009	For thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I am about to cause to cease from this place, Before your eyes, in your days, The voice of joy and the voice of mirth, The voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride.
024	JER	016	010	And when thou shalt have declared to this people all these things, and they shall say to thee, “Why hath Jehovah pronounced against us all this great evil? What is our iniquity, and what our sin, which we have committed against Jehovah our God?”
024	JER	016	011	Then shalt thou say to them: Because your fathers have forsaken me, saith Jehovah, And have walked after strange gods, And have served them and worshipped them, And have forsaken me, and not kept my law.
024	JER	016	012	And ye yourselves have done worse than your fathers; For, behold, ye walk every one after the perverseness of his evil heart, And do not hearken to me.
024	JER	016	013	Therefore will I cast you forth from this land Into a land unknown to you and to your fathers; And there shall ye serve strange gods day and night; For I will show you no favor.
024	JER	016	014	Yet behold the days shall come, saith Jehovah, When men shall no more say, “As Jehovah liveth Who brought up the children of Israel from the land of Egypt,”
024	JER	016	015	But, “As Jehovah liveth Who brought up the children of Israel from the land of the North, And from all the lands whither he had driven them.” For I will bring them again into their own land, Which I gave to their fathers.
024	JER	016	016	Behold, I will send many fishers, saith Jehovah, who shall fish them, And then will I send many hunters who shall hunt them From every mountain, and from every hill, and from the holes of the rocks.
024	JER	016	017	For mine eyes are upon all their ways; They are not concealed from my view, Nor is their iniquity hidden from mine eyes.
024	JER	016	018	And I will requite their former and their repeated iniquities and sins, Because they have polluted my land with carcasses offered to their idols, And filled my inheritance with their abominable things.
024	JER	016	019	O Jehovah, my strength and my fortress, My refuge in the day of distress! To thee shall the nations come from the ends of the earth, And shall say, “Truly our fathers inherited delusion, Vain and unprofitable things.
024	JER	016	020	Shall one make for himself gods Which are no gods?”
024	JER	016	021	Therefore, behold, I will this time cause them to feel, I will cause them to feel my hand and my might, And they shall know that my name is Jehovah.
024	JER	017	001	The sin of Judah is written with a pen of iron, With the point of a diamond is it engraved Upon the tablet of their hearts, Upon the horns of their altars.
024	JER	017	002	While their children remember the altars, and the images of Astarte, Near the green trees, And upon the high hills.
024	JER	017	003	My mountain in the field! thy substance and all thy treasures will I give up for spoil; Thy high places for sin in all thy borders.
024	JER	017	004	Thou shalt of thyself cease to possess the inheritance which I gave thee, And I will cause thee to serve thy enemies in a land which thou knowest not; For ye have kindled a fire in my anger, Which shall burn forever.
024	JER	017	005	Thus saith Jehovah: Cursed be the man who trusteth in man, And maketh flesh his arm, And whose heart departeth from Jehovah!
024	JER	017	006	He shall be like a poor wanderer in the desert, Who seeth not when good cometh, But dwelleth in the parched places of the desert, In a salt land, and uninhabited.
024	JER	017	007	Blessed is the man who trusteth in Jehovah; Who in Jehovah placeth his hope!
024	JER	017	008	He shall be like a tree planted by the water-side, That spreadeth out her roots by the stream, That feeleth not when the heat cometh, But whose leaf is green; That careth not in the year of drought, Nor ceaseth from yielding fruit.
024	JER	017	009	The heart is deceitful above all things; Yea, it is corrupt; who can know it?
024	JER	017	010	I, Jehovah, search the heart, And try the reins, To give to every man according to his ways, And according to the fruit of his doings.
024	JER	017	011	As the partridge sitteth on eggs which she hath not laid, So is he that getteth riches, and not by right; In the midst of his days shall he leave them, And in his latter end find himself a fool.
024	JER	017	012	A glorious, lofty throne from the beginning Hath been the place of our sanctuary.
024	JER	017	013	O thou hope of Israel, Jehovah! All that forsake thee shall be put to shame; Yea, all that depart from me shall be written in dust, Because they have forsaken the fountain of living water, they have forsaken Jehovah.
024	JER	017	014	Heal me, O Jehovah, and I shall be healed; Save me, and I shall be saved; For thou art my praise!
024	JER	017	015	Behold, they say to me, “Where is the word of Jehovah? Let it come to pass!”
024	JER	017	016	I have not refused to follow thee, as thy shepherd, Neither have I desired the day of woe, as thou knowest! That which came from my lips hath been before thine eyes.
024	JER	017	017	Be not thou a terror to me, Thou, my refuge in the day of distress! Let my persecutors be confounded, but let not me be confounded!
024	JER	017	018	Let them be dismayed, but let not me be dismayed! Bring upon them the day of calamity, And destroy them with double destruction!
024	JER	017	019	Thus said Jehovah to me: Go and stand in the people's gate, Through which the kings of Judah come in and go out, And in all the gates of Jerusalem,
024	JER	017	020	And say to them, Hear the word of Jehovah, ye kings of Judah, All Judah, and all ye who dwell at Jerusalem, Who enter in through these gates!
024	JER	017	021	Thus saith Jehovah: Take heed to yourselves, And carry no burden on the sabbath-day, And bring none through the gates of Jerusalem.
024	JER	017	022	Bear no burden from your houses on the sabbath-day, And do no kind of work; But keep ye holy the sabbath-day, As I commanded your fathers.
024	JER	017	023	But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear, But made their necks stiff, and refused to hear, And refused to receive instruction.
024	JER	017	024	If ye will now diligently hearken to me, saith Jehovah, And bring no burden through the gates of this city on the sabbath-day, But keep holy the sabbath-day, Doing no work therein,
024	JER	017	025	Then shall enter the gates of this city kings and princes, Who sit upon the throne of David, Riding in chariots and on horses, They and their chieftains, The men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem; And this city shall be inhabited forever.
024	JER	017	026	Then from the cities of Judah, and the places around Jerusalem, From the land of Benjamin, and from the plain, From the mountains, and from the South, Shall they come bringing burnt-offerings, and sacrifices, And flour-offerings, and incense, And bringing thank-offerings to the house of Jehovah.
024	JER	017	027	But if ye will not hearken to me, To keep holy the sabbath-day, And to carry no burden through the gates of Jerusalem on the sabbath-day, Then will I kindle in her gates an unquenchable fire, Which shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem.
024	JER	018	001	The word which came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying:
024	JER	018	002	Arise, and go down to the potter's house, and there will I cause thee to hear my words.
024	JER	018	003	So I went down to the potter's house, and behold, he was at work at the wheel.
024	JER	018	004	And the vessel which he was making of clay was marred in the hand of the potter; so he began anew and made it another vessel, as seemed good to the potter to make it.
024	JER	018	005	Then came the word of Jehovah to me, saying:
024	JER	018	006	Cannot I do after the manner of this potter With respect to you. O house of Israel, saith Jehovah? Behold, as the clay is in the hand of the potter, So are ye in my hand, O house of Israel!
024	JER	018	007	Whenever I speak concerning a nation or a kingdom, That I will pluck it up, cast it down, or destroy it,
024	JER	018	008	If that nation shall turn from its wickedness On account of which I threatened it, Then will I repent of the evil which I purposed to do to it.
024	JER	018	009	And whenever I speak concerning a nation or a kingdom, That I will build it, or plant it,
024	JER	018	010	And it shall do that which is evil in my sight, And not hearken to my voice, Then will I repent of the good with which I promised to bless them.
024	JER	018	011	And now speak to the men of Judah, And to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I am framing evil against you, And meditating a design against you; Return ye now every one from his evil way, And amend your ways and your doings.
024	JER	018	012	But they say, “There is no remedy, For we will walk after our own devices, And we will practise every one the perverseness of his evil heart.”
024	JER	018	013	Therefore thus saith Jehovah: Inquire ye now among the nations, Who hath heard such things as these? The virgin of Israel hath done a deed of horror.
024	JER	018	014	Shall the snow from the rocks of Lebanon forsake my fields? Or shall the cold flowing waters, that come from afar, be dried up?
024	JER	018	015	Yet my people have forgotten me, And burned incense to vanity; They stumble in their paths, the old ways, And walk in ways that have not been thrown up,
024	JER	018	016	To make their land a desolation, A perpetual hissing; Every one that passeth through it shall be amazed, And shake his head.
024	JER	018	017	I will scatter them before the enemy, as with the east wind; I will show them the back, and not the face, In the day of their calamity.
024	JER	018	018	But they say, “Come, let us devise measures against Jeremiah; For the law shall not perish from the priest, Nor counsel from the wise, Nor the word from the prophet; Come, let us smite him with the tongue, And not give heed to any of his words.”
024	JER	018	019	Give heed to me, O Jehovah, And hear the voice of my adversaries!
024	JER	018	020	Shall evil be returned for good? For they have digged a pit for me. Remember how I have stood before thee, To announce good to them, And to turn away thy wrath from them!
024	JER	018	021	Therefore give thou up their sons to famine, And deliver them to the edge of the sword! Let their wives be childless and widows, Let their men be slain by pestilence, And their young men fall by the sword in battle!
024	JER	018	022	Let a cry be heard from their houses, When thou shalt bring a troop upon them suddenly! For they have digged a pit to take me, And hidden snares for my feet.
024	JER	018	023	Thou, O Jehovah, knowest all their plots against my life! Cover not their iniquity, And blot not out their sin from thy sight! But let them be overthrown before thee; Deal with them in the time of thy wrath!
024	JER	019	001	Thus saith Jehovah: Go and buy an earthen bottle of the potter, And take with thee the elders of the people, And the elders of the priests,
024	JER	019	002	And go forth to the valley of the son of Hinnom, At the entrance of the pottery-gate, And proclaim there the words Which I shall speak to thee.
024	JER	019	003	Say, Hear the word of Jehovah, Ye kings of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem! Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I am about to bring such an evil upon this place, That whoever heareth of it, his ears shall tingle.
024	JER	019	004	For they have forsaken me, And have alienated this place, And have burned incense in it to strange gods, Which neither they, nor their fathers, nor the kings of Judah have known, And have filled this place with the blood of innocent children,
024	JER	019	005	And have built high places to Baal, To burn their sons in the fire for burnt-offerings to Baal; Which I ordained not, and commanded not, And which never came into my mind.
024	JER	019	006	Therefore, behold, the days are coming, saith Jehovah, When this place shall no more be called Tophet, Nor the valley of the son of Hinnom, But the valley of Slaughter.
024	JER	019	007	For I will in this place bring to naught the plans of Judah and Jerusalem, And I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies, And by the hands of them that seek their lives; And their dead bodies will I give for food To the birds of heaven and the beasts of the earth.
024	JER	019	008	And I will make this city a wonder and a hissing; Every one that passeth by it shall wonder and hiss, On account of all its plagues.
024	JER	019	009	For I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and of their daughters, Yea, the flesh of each other shall they eat, In the straitness and the distress With which their enemies, and they that seek their lives, shall press them.
024	JER	019	010	Then break thou the bottle Before the eyes of the men that go with thee.
024	JER	019	011	And say to them: Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: So will I break this people and this city, As one breaks a potter's vessel which cannot be made whole again; And they shall be buried in Tophet, till there is no room to bury.
024	JER	019	012	Thus will I do to this place and to its inhabitants, saith Jehovah, And I will make this city itself like Tophet;
024	JER	019	013	And the houses of Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of Judah shall be unclean, like the place of Tophet, All the houses upon whose roofs they have burned incense to all the host of heaven, And poured out drink-offerings to strange gods.
024	JER	019	014	Then came Jeremiah from Tophet, Whither Jehovah had sent him to prophesy, And stood in the court of the house of Jehovah, And said to all the people:
024	JER	019	015	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I am about to bring upon this city, and upon all the cities belonging to it, All the evil which I have pronounced against it; For they have made their necks stiff, And refused to hearken to my words.
024	JER	020	001	Now Pashur, the son of Immer, the priest, who was also chief overseer in the house of Jehovah, heard Jeremiah prophesying these things.
024	JER	020	002	Then Pashur smote Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks, that were at the high gate of Benjamin, which was in the house of Jehovah.
024	JER	020	003	And on the next day Pashur took Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then said Jeremiah to him, Jehovah calleth thee, not Pashur, but Magor-missabib [[not Safety on every side, but Terror on every side]].
024	JER	020	004	For thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I am about to make thee a terror to thyself and to all thy friends; and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, thine eyes looking on; and all Judah will I give into the hand of the king of Babylon, who shall carry them captive to Babylon, and shall smite them with the sword.
024	JER	020	005	And I will give all the wealth of this city, and all its possessions, and all its precious things, and all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give, into the hand of their enemies, and they shall spoil them, and take them and carry them to Babylon.
024	JER	020	006	And thou, Pashur, and all that dwell in thy house, shall go into captivity; thou shalt go to Babylon, and there shalt thou die, and there shalt thou be buried, thou, and all thy friends, to whom thou hast prophesied falsely.
024	JER	020	007	Thou didst persuade me, O Jehovah, and I was persuaded; Thou wast stronger than I, and didst prevail. But I am in derision daily, Every one mocketh me.
024	JER	020	008	For whenever I speak, I cry out on account of violence, And complain of oppression; For the word of Jehovah bringeth upon me reproach, And daily derision.
024	JER	020	009	So I say, I will no more make mention of him, Nor speak any more in his name; But his word is in my heart like a burning fire, shut up in my bones, And I am weary with forbearing, And I cannot refrain.
024	JER	020	010	For I hear the slander of many, terror on every side; “Tell us something against him, and we will denounce him.” All my familiar friends, they who leave not my side, [[say, ]] “Perhaps he will be enticed, So that we may prevail against him, And take our revenge on him.”
024	JER	020	011	But Jehovah is on my side, like a mighty champion, Therefore shall my persecutors stumble, and not prevail; They shall be covered with shame, because they act not wisely, —With everlasting shame, that shall not be forgotten.
024	JER	020	012	O Jehovah of hosts, thou that provest the righteous, That seest the reins and the heart, Let me see thy vengeance on them, For to thee have I laid open my cause!
024	JER	020	013	Sing to Jehovah! Praise ye Jehovah! For he delivereth the oppressed From the hand of evil-doers.
024	JER	020	014	Cursed be the day on which I was born; Let not the day on which my mother bore me be blessed!
024	JER	020	015	Cursed be the man who brought the tidings to my father, Saying, “A son is born to thee,” making him very glad!
024	JER	020	016	Let that man be like the cities which Jehovah overthrew, and relented not; Let him hear an outcry in the morning, And an alarm at noontide;
024	JER	020	017	Because he slew me not before I saw the light, So that my mother might have been my grave, And her womb have been great with me forever!
024	JER	020	018	Wherefore came I forth from the womb, to see weariness and sorrow, And that my days might be consumed in shame?
024	JER	021	001	The word which came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, when King Zedekiah sent to him Pashur, the son of Melchiah, and Zephaniah, the son of Maaseiah, the priest, saying:
024	JER	021	002	Inquire, I pray thee, of Jehovah for us; for Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, maketh war against us; whether Jehovah will deal with us according to all his wondrous works, that he may go up from us.
024	JER	021	003	And Jeremiah said to them, Thus shall ye say to Zedekiah:
024	JER	021	004	Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: Behold, I will turn back the weapons of war which are in your hands, with which ye fight against the king of Babylon and the Chaldaeans, which besiege you without the walls, and I will assemble them in the midst of this city.
024	JER	021	005	And I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand, and with a strong arm, with anger and fury and great wrath.
024	JER	021	006	And I will smite the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast; by a great pestilence shall they die.
024	JER	021	007	And after this, saith Jehovah, I will deliver Zedekiah, the king of Judah, and his servants, and the people, and those in the city who shall be left alive by the pestilence, the sword, and the famine, into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, and into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those that seek their life; and he shall smite them with the edge of the sword. He shall not spare them, nor have pity, nor show mercy.
024	JER	021	008	And to this people thou shalt say, Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I set before you the way of life, and the way of death.
024	JER	021	009	He that abideth in this city shall die by the sword, and by famine, and by pestilence; but he that goeth out and surrendereth himself to the Chaldaeans that besiege you, he shall live, and bear away his life as a prey.
024	JER	021	010	For I have set my face against this city for evil, and not for good, saith Jehovah. It shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire.
024	JER	021	011	And to the house of the king of Judah: Hear ye the word of Jehovah,
024	JER	021	012	O house of David! Thus saith Jehovah: Administer justice in season, and deliver him that is spoiled from the hand of the oppressor, lest my fury go forth like fire, and burn so that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings!
024	JER	021	013	Behold, I am against thee, thou inhabitant of the valley, the rock of the plain, who sayest, “Who shall come down against us? Or who shall enter our habitations?”
024	JER	021	014	But I will punish you with the fruit of your doings. I will kindle a fire in her forest, which shall consume all around her.
024	JER	022	001	Thus said Jehovah: Go down to the house of the king of Judah, and there speak these words.
024	JER	022	002	Hear the word of Jehovah, thou king of Judah, That sittest upon the throne of David, Thou, and thy servants, and thy people, Who go in and out through these gates!
024	JER	022	003	Thus saith Jehovah: Do justice and righteousness; Deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor; To the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow Do no wrong, do no violence, And shed no innocent blood in this place!
024	JER	022	004	For if ye shall do this, Then shall there enter in through the gates of this house Kings, who shall sit upon the throne of David, Riding in chariots and upon horses, Each one with his servants and his people.
024	JER	022	005	But if ye will not hearken to these words, By myself do I swear, saith Jehovah, That this house shall become a desolation.
024	JER	022	006	For thus saith Jehovah to the house of the king of Judah: Gilead art thou to me, yea, the summit of Lebanon; Yet will I make thee a desert, As cities not inhabited.
024	JER	022	007	I will appoint against thee destroyers, Every one with his weapons; And they shall cut down thy choice cedars, And cast them into the fire.
024	JER	022	008	And many nations shall pass by this city, And they shall say one to another, “Wherefore hath Jehovah done thus to this great city?”
024	JER	022	009	Then shall they answer: “Because they forsook the covenant of Jehovah their God, And worshipped strange gods, And served them.”
024	JER	022	010	Weep not for him that is dead, Make no lamentation for him! Weep, weep ye for him who is gone away; For he shall return no more, Nor see his native land!
024	JER	022	011	For thus saith Jehovah Concerning Shallum, the son of Josiah, king of Judah, Who reigned instead of Josiah his father, Who went forth from this place: He shall return to it no more;
024	JER	022	012	But in the place whither they have led him captive shall he die, And shall see this land no more.
024	JER	022	013	Woe to him that buildeth his house with injustice, And his upper apartments with wrong; That exacteth a man's service without wages, And giveth him no recompense!
024	JER	022	014	That saith, “I will build me a large house, And spacious apartments,” And that cutteth out windows, And ceileth it with cedar, And painteth it with vermilion!
024	JER	022	015	Shalt thou reign because thou rivallest others in cedar? Did not thy father eat and drink? Yet he had regard to justice and equity; Therefore it was well, with him.
024	JER	022	016	He maintained the cause of the poor and needy; Then was it well with him; Was not this to know me, saith Jehovah?
024	JER	022	017	But thine eyes and thy heart are only upon thine own gain, And the shedding of innocent blood, And deeds of violence and oppression.
024	JER	022	018	Therefore thus saith Jehovah, Concerning Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, king of Judah: They shall not lament for him, saying, “Alas, my brother!” or, “Alas, sister!” They shall not lament for him, saying, “Alas, lord!” or, “Alas, his glory!”
024	JER	022	019	With the burial of an ass shall he be buried, Dragged along and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem.
024	JER	022	020	Go thou up to Lebanon and cry, [[O Jerusalem!]] And upon Bashan lift up thy voice; Cry aloud from Abarim! For all thy lovers are fallen.
024	JER	022	021	I spake to thee in thy prosperity, But thou saidst, “I will not hear.” This hath been thy manner from thy youth; Thou hast not obeyed my voice.
024	JER	022	022	The wind shall consume all thy shepherds, And thy lovers shall go into captivity; Then shalt thou be ashamed And confounded for all thy wickedness.
024	JER	022	023	O thou that dwellest in Lebanon, That makest thy nest in cedars, How wretched shalt thou be, when anguish cometh upon thee, Pain, as of a woman in travail!
024	JER	022	024	As I live, saith Jehovah, Thou Coniah, son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, Though thou wert the signet upon my right hand, Even thence would I pluck thee!
024	JER	022	025	And I will give thee into the hand of them that seek thy life, And into the hand of them that thou fearest, Even into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, And into the hand of the Chaldaeans.
024	JER	022	026	And I will cast thee forth, And thy mother that bore thee, Into a foreign land, Where ye were not born; And there shall ye die.
024	JER	022	027	To the land to which they desire to return, Thither shall they not return.
024	JER	022	028	“Is then this man Coniah a contemptible broken vessel? Is he a vessel which no man careth for? Wherefore are he and his offspring cast forth, And thrown into a land which they know not?”
024	JER	022	029	O land, land, land, hear the word of Jehovah!
024	JER	022	030	Thus saith Jehovah: Write ye this man childless, A man that shall not be prosperous through his life; For none of his offspring shall prosper, So as to sit on the throne of David, And reign hereafter in Judah.
024	JER	023	001	Woe to the shepherds, Who lose and scatter the sheep of my pasture, saith Jehovah.
024	JER	023	002	For concerning the shepherds, the feeders of my people, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: Ye have scattered my flock, and driven them away, And have not taken care of them. Behold, I am about to requite you For the evil of your doings, saith Jehovah.
024	JER	023	003	But I will gather the remnant of my flock From all the countries whither I have driven them, And I will bring them back to their folds, And they shall be fruitful and increase.
024	JER	023	004	And I will raise up shepherds over them, who shall feed them; They shall fear no more, nor be dismayed; Nor shall they be lost, saith Jehovah.
024	JER	023	005	Behold, the days are coming, saith Jehovah, When I will raise up from David a righteous Branch, And a king shall reign and prosper, And shall maintain justice and equity in the land.
024	JER	023	006	In his days Judah shall be saved, And Israel shall dwell securely; And this is the name which shall be given him, Jehovah-is-our-salvation.
024	JER	023	007	Therefore, behold, the days shall come, saith Jehovah, When they shall no more say, “As Jehovah liveth Who brought up the children of Israel from the land of Egypt!”
024	JER	023	008	But, “As Jehovah liveth Who brought up and led the race of Israel from the north country, And from all the countries whither I had driven them!” And they shall dwell in their own land.
024	JER	023	009	Concerning the Prophets. My heart is broken within me; All my bones tremble. I am become like a drunken man, Like a man whom wine hath overcome, Because of Jehovah, And because of his holy words.
024	JER	023	010	For the land is full of adulteries; Because of a curse doth the land mourn; The pastures of the waste are dried up; For they run to do evil, And their might is without right.
024	JER	023	011	Yea, both prophet and priest are profane; Even in my house have I found their wickedness, saith Jehovah.
024	JER	023	012	Therefore shall their way become as slippery places in the dark; They shall be driven on and fall therein; For I will bring evil upon them In the time of their visitation, saith Jehovah.
024	JER	023	013	In the prophets of Samaria have I seen folly; They prophesy in the name of Baal, and cause my people Israel to err.
024	JER	023	014	In the prophets of Jerusalem also have I seen a horrible thing; They commit adultery, and walk in falsehood; They strengthen the hands of evil-doers, So that none doth turn from his iniquity. They have all become to me as Sodom, And her inhabitants as Gomorrah.
024	JER	023	015	Therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts concerning the prophets: Behold, I will feed them with wormwood, And give them the water of hemlock to drink; For from the prophets of Jerusalem Hath profaneness gone forth into all the land.
024	JER	023	016	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Hearken not to the words of the prophets; They lead you to vanity; They utter the vision of their own heart, And not from the mouth of Jehovah.
024	JER	023	017	To them that despise me they say continually, “Jehovah hath said, Ye shall have peace”; And to every one that walketh after the perverseness of his heart, “No evil shall come upon you.”
024	JER	023	018	For who of them hath stood in the council of Jehovah, And hath seen and heard his word? Who hath listened to his word and heard it?
024	JER	023	019	Behold a whirlwind from Jehovah goeth forth in fury, Even a rushing whirlwind; Upon the head of the wicked shall it rush.
024	JER	023	020	The fierce anger of Jehovah shall not turn back, Until he shall have executed, until he shall have accomplished the purpose of his heart. In the latter days ye shall understand it fully.
024	JER	023	021	I sent not these prophets, yet they ran; I spake not to them, yet they prophesied.
024	JER	023	022	For if they had stood in my council, Then would they have caused my people to hear my words, And would have turned them from their evil way. And from the wickedness of their doings.
024	JER	023	023	Am I a God near at hand, saith Jehovah, And not a God afar off?
024	JER	023	024	Can any one hide himself in secret places, So that I shall not see him? saith Jehovah; Do I nor fill heaven and earth? saith Jehovah.
024	JER	023	025	I have heard what the prophets say, Who prophesy falsehood in my name, Saying, “I have dreamed, I have dreamed.”
024	JER	023	026	How long shall this be In the heart of the prophets, who prophesy falsehood, The prophets of the deceit of their own heart,
024	JER	023	027	Who think to cause my people to forget my name By the dreams which they relate one to another, As their fathers forgot my name through Baal?
024	JER	023	028	The prophet who hath a dream, let him tell a dream; And he that hath my word, let him speak my word truly! What is the chaff to the wheat? saith Jehovah.
024	JER	023	029	Is not my word like fire, saith Jehovah, And like a hammer, that breaketh the rock in pieces?
024	JER	023	030	Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets, saith Jehovah, That steal my words one from another.
024	JER	023	031	Behold, I am against the prophets, saith Jehovah, That take their tongues and utter oracles.
024	JER	023	032	Behold, I am against the prophets of false dreams, saith Jehovah, Who tell them, and cause my people to err By their lies and their arrogance. I have not sent them, nor commanded them, And they shall not profit this people at all, saith Jehovah.
024	JER	023	033	And when this people, or a prophet, or a priest Shall ask thee, saying, “What is the burden from Jehovah?” Then say thou to them, “What is the burden?” That I will cast you away, saith Jehovah.
024	JER	023	034	And the prophet, the priest, and the people, Who shall say, “The burden of Jehovah,” I will punish that man and his house.
024	JER	023	035	Thus shall ye speak, one to another: “What hath Jehovah answered?” And, “What hath Jehovah spoken?”
024	JER	023	036	And of a burden of Jehovah shall ye speak no more; Else shall every man's word be his burden, Because ye pervert the words of the living God, Of Jehovah of hosts, our God.
024	JER	023	037	Thus shalt thou say to the prophet: “What hath Jehovah answered thee?” And, “What hath Jehovah spoken?”
024	JER	023	038	If ye shall say, “The burden of Jehovah,” Then thus saith Jehovah: Because ye say, “The burden of Jehovah,” Although I sent to you and said, Ye shall not say, “The burden of Jehovah,”
024	JER	023	039	Therefore, behold, I will utterly forget you, And I will cast you, and the city which I gave to your fathers, out of my presence;
024	JER	023	040	And I will bring upon you an everlasting reproach, And a perpetual shame which shall not be forgotten.
024	JER	024	001	Jehovah showed me this vision. Behold, two baskets of figs were set before the temple of Jehovah. This was after Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, had carried away captive Jeconiah, the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and the princes of Judah, and the artificers, and the smiths, from Jerusalem, and had led them to Babylon.
024	JER	024	002	One of the baskets contained very good figs, like those which are first ripe. The other contained very bad figs, so bad that they could not be eaten.
024	JER	024	003	And Jehovah said to me, What seest thou, Jeremiah? And I said: Figs; the good figs, exceedingly good; and the bad, exceedingly bad, so bad that they cannot be eaten.
024	JER	024	004	Then came the word of Jehovah to me, saying:
024	JER	024	005	Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: As these good figs, so will I regard the captives of Judah, whom I have sent out of this place into the land of Chaldaea for their good;
024	JER	024	006	yea, I will set my eyes upon them for good, and I will bring them again to this land; and I will build them up, and not pull them down; and I will plant them, and not pluck them up.
024	JER	024	007	And I will give them a heart to know me, that I am Jehovah; and they shall be my people, and I will be their God; for they shall return to me with their whole heart.
024	JER	024	008	And as the bad figs, which are so bad that they cannot be eaten, saith Jehovah, so will I make Zedekiah, the king of Judah, and his princes, and the residue of Jerusalem, those that are left in this land, and those that dwell in the land of Egypt;
024	JER	024	009	and I will give them up to oppression and affliction in all the kingdoms of the earth; yea, to be a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curse, in all places whither I shall drive them.
024	JER	024	010	And I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence among them, till they be consumed from the land, which I gave to them and to their fathers.
024	JER	025	001	The word which came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, king of Judah, which was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon;
024	JER	025	002	which Jeremiah the prophet spake to all the people of Judah, and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying: —
024	JER	025	003	From the thirteenth year of Josiah, the son of Amon, king of Judah, even to this day, for three and twenty years, the word of Jehovah hath come to me, and I have spoken to you, rising early and speaking; but ye have not hearkened.
024	JER	025	004	Also Jehovah hath sent to you all his servants the prophets, rising early and sending them; but ye have not hearkened, nor inclined your ear to hear.
024	JER	025	005	“Turn ye now,” said they, “every one from your evil way, and from your evil doings, and ye shall dwell in the land which Jehovah gave to you and to your fathers for ever and ever.
024	JER	025	006	And go not after strange gods to serve them, and to worship them, and provoke me not to anger with the work of your hands; and I will do you no hurt.”
024	JER	025	007	But ye have not hearkened to me, saith Jehovah, that ye might provoke me to anger with the works of your hands to your own hurt.
024	JER	025	008	Therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Because ye have not hearkened to my words,
024	JER	025	009	behold, I will send and take all the nations of the North, saith Jehovah, and Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, my servant, and will bring them against this land and its inhabitants, and against all these nations round about, and will utterly destroy them, and make them an astonishment, and a hissing, and a perpetual desolation.
024	JER	025	010	Yea, I will take from them the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the sound of the mill-stones, and the light of the lamp.
024	JER	025	011	And this whole land shall be a desolation and an astonishment; and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years.
024	JER	025	012	But when seventy years shall have passed, I will punish the king of Babylon and his nation for their iniquity, saith Jehovah, and the land of the Chaldaeans, and I will make it a perpetual desolation.
024	JER	025	013	And I will bring upon that land all my words which I have pronounced against it, all that is written in this book, which Jeremiah hath prophesied against all the nations.
024	JER	025	014	For they, even they, shall be brought into subjection to many nations and great kings. I will render to them according to their deeds, and according to the works of their own hands.
024	JER	025	015	For thus hath Jehovah, the God of Israel, said to me: Take this cup of the wine of wrath from my hand; and let all the nations to which I shall send thee drink of it.
024	JER	025	016	Let them drink, and stagger, and become mad because of the sword which I am about to send among them.
024	JER	025	017	So I took the cup from the hand of Jehovah, and gave it to all the nations to drink, to which Jehovah sent me;
024	JER	025	018	to Jerusalem and to the cities of Judah, and to the kings thereof, and the princes thereof, to make them a desolation, and an astonishment, and a hissing, and a curse; [[as it is this day.]]
024	JER	025	019	To Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and to his servants, and to his princes, and to all his people,
024	JER	025	020	and all the allied people; and to all the kings of the land of Uz, and to all the kings of the land of the Philistines, and to Askelon, and to Gaza, and to Ekron, and to the remnant of Ashdod;
024	JER	025	021	to Edom, and to Moab, and to the children of Ammon;
024	JER	025	022	and to all the kings of Tyre, and to all the kings of Sidon, and to the kings of the lands which are beyond the sea;
024	JER	025	023	to Dedan, and to Tema, and to Buz, and to all that shave the cheek;
024	JER	025	024	and to all the kings of Arabia, and to all the kings of the allied people who dwell in the desert;
024	JER	025	025	and to all the kings of Zimri, and to all the kings of Elam, and to all the kings of Media;
024	JER	025	026	and to all the kings of the North, those that are near, and those that are afar off with respect to each other, and to all the kingdoms of the earth which are upon the face of the ground; and the king of Sheshach shall drink after them.
024	JER	025	027	And say to them, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Drink ye and be drunken, and vomit, and fall to rise no more because of the sword which I am about to send among you.
024	JER	025	028	And if they refuse to take the cup from thy hand to drink, then say to them, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Ye shall surely drink!
024	JER	025	029	For behold, upon the city which is called by my name I begin to bring evil; and shall ye go wholly unpunished? Ye shall not go unpunished; for I am about to call the sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, saith Jehovah of hosts.
024	JER	025	030	Therefore, prophesy against them all these words, and say to them: —Jehovah shall roar from on high, From his holy habitation shall he utter his voice; He shall roar aloud against his dwelling-place; A shout like that of vintagers shall he raise Against all the inhabitants of the earth.
024	JER	025	031	An outcry shall reach to the ends of the earth; For Jehovah hath a controversy with the nations; He entereth into judgment with all flesh; The wicked will he give up to the sword, saith Jehovah.
024	JER	025	032	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Behold, evil shall go forth from nation to nation, And a great whirlwind shall be raised up from the extremities of the earth.
024	JER	025	033	At that day shall the slain of Jehovah lie From one end of the earth to the other end of the earth; They shall not be lamented, nor gathered, nor buried; They shall be dung upon the ground.
024	JER	025	034	Howl, O ye shepherds, and cry! Roll yourselves in the dust, ye leaders of the flock, For your time to be slaughtered has come! And I will scatter you, and ye shall fall like a goodly vessel.
024	JER	025	035	The shepherds shall have no way to flee, Nor the leaders of the flock to escape.
024	JER	025	036	[[Hark!]] the voice of the cry of the shepherds, And the wailing of the leaders of the flock, Because Jehovah layeth waste their pasture!
024	JER	025	037	Yea, the peaceful pastures are destroyed Because of the fierce anger of Jehovah.
024	JER	025	038	He hath left, like a lion, his covert; For their land is become desolate, Because of the wrath of the destroying sword, And because of the fierceness of his anger.
024	JER	026	001	In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, king of Judah, came this word from Jehovah, saying: —
024	JER	026	002	Thus saith Jehovah: Stand in the court of the house of Jehovah, and speak to those who come from all the cities of Judah to worship in the house of Jehovah all the words which I have commanded thee to speak to them; abate not a word.
024	JER	026	003	If peradventure they will hearken and turn every one from his evil way, that I may repent me of the evil which I purpose to do to them because of their evil doings.
024	JER	026	004	And thou shalt say to them, Thus saith Jehovah: If ye will not hearken to me, to walk in my law which I have set before you,
024	JER	026	005	to hearken to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I sent to you, rising early and sending, and ye have not hearkened,
024	JER	026	006	then will I make this house like Shiloh, and this city will I make a curse to all the nations of the earth.
024	JER	026	007	And the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of Jehovah.
024	JER	026	008	And when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that Jehovah had commanded him to speak to all the people, then the priests and the prophets and all the people seized him, and said, Thou shalt surely die!
024	JER	026	009	Why dost thou prophesy in the name of Jehovah, and say, This house shall be as Shiloh, and this city shall be made desolate without an inhabitant? And all the people were assembled together against Jeremiah in the house of Jehovah.
024	JER	026	010	When the princes of Judah heard these things, they went up from the king's house to the house of Jehovah, and sat in the entrance of the new gate of the house of Jehovah.
024	JER	026	011	Then spake the priests and the prophets to the princes and to all the people, saying: This man is worthy to die; for he hath prophesied against this city, as ye have heard with your ears.
024	JER	026	012	Then spake Jeremiah to all the princes and to all the people, saying: Jehovah hath sent me to prophesy against this house, and against this city, all the words which ye have heard.
024	JER	026	013	But now amend ye your ways and your doings, and obey the voice of Jehovah, your God, and Jehovah will repent of the evil which he hath pronounced against you.
024	JER	026	014	And as for me, behold, I am in your hands; do to me as it seemeth good and right in your eyes.
024	JER	026	015	But know ye for certain that, if ye put me to death, ye shall surely bring innocent blood upon yourselves, and upon this city, and its inhabitants; for of a truth Jehovah hath sent me to you to speak all these words in your ears.
024	JER	026	016	Then said the princes and all the people to the priests and the prophets: This man is not worthy to die, for he hath spoken to us in the name of Jehovah, our God.
024	JER	026	017	Certain elders of the land also rose up, and spoke to all the assembly of the people, saying:
024	JER	026	018	Micah, the Morasthite, prophesied in the days of Hezekiah, king of Judah, and spake to all the people of Judah, saying, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Zion shall be ploughed like a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps of stones, and the mountain of the house [[of Jehovah]] as the heights of a forest.
024	JER	026	019	Did Hezekiah, king of Judah, and all Judah, put him to death? Did he not fear Jehovah, and beseech Jehovah, so that Jehovah repented of the evil which he had pronounced against them? Shall we then bring so great an evil upon ourselves?
024	JER	026	020	There was also another man that prophesied in the name of Jehovah, Urijah, the son of Shemaiah of Kirjath-jearim, who prophesied against this city and this land, according to all the words of Jeremiah;
024	JER	026	021	and when Jehoiakim the king, and all his mighty men, and all the princes, heard his words, the king sought to put him to death. But when Urijah heard it, he was afraid, and fled and went into Egypt.
024	JER	026	022	But Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, Elnathan the son of Achbor, and certain men with him into Egypt,
024	JER	026	023	and they brought Urijah out of Egypt, and carried him to King Jehoiakim, who slew him with the sword, and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people.
024	JER	026	024	Nevertheless, the hand of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, was with Jeremiah, that he should not be delivered into the hand of the people, to be put to death.
024	JER	027	001	In the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah, the son of Josiah, king of Judah, came this word to Jeremiah from Jehovah.
024	JER	027	002	Thus said Jehovah to me: Make thee bands and yokes, and put them upon thy neck,
024	JER	027	003	and send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the children of Ammon, and to the king of Tyre, and to the king of Zidon, by the hands of the messengers that are come to Jerusalem, to Zedekiah, king of Judah.
024	JER	027	004	And command them to say to their masters, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Thus shall ye say to your masters:
024	JER	027	005	The earth, and the men and the beasts which are upon the earth, have I made by my great power and my outstretched arm, and I give it to whomsoever it seemeth meet to me.
024	JER	027	006	And now I give all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, my servant; the beasts of the field also I give him to serve him.
024	JER	027	007	And all nations shall serve him, and his son, and his son's son, until the time of his land, even his, shall come, and then shall many nations and great kings make him their servant.
024	JER	027	008	And the nation and the kingdom that will not serve him, Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, and put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, —with the sword and with famine and with pestilence will I punish that nation, saith Jehovah, until I have consumed them by his hand.
024	JER	027	009	Therefore hearken ye not to your prophets, and your diviners, and your dreamers, your soothsayers, and your sorcerers, who say to you, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon.
024	JER	027	010	For they prophesy a lie to you, to remove you far from your land, and that I should drive you out, and that ye should perish.
024	JER	027	011	But the nations that bring their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him, those will I let remain still in their own land, saith Jehovah, and they shall till it, and dwell therein.
024	JER	027	012	And to Zedekiah, king of Judah, also, spake I according to all these words, and said: Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people, and live.
024	JER	027	013	Why will ye die, thou and thy people, by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence, as Jehovah hath spoken concerning the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon?
024	JER	027	014	Therefore hearken not to the prophets, that say to you, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon; for they prophesy a lie to you.
024	JER	027	015	For I have not sent them, saith Jehovah; but they prophesy a lie in my name, that I may drive you out, and that ye may perish, ye and the prophets that prophesy to you.
024	JER	027	016	To the priests, also, and to all the people; spake I, saying, Thus saith Jehovah: Hearken not to the words of your prophets who prophesy to you, and say, Behold the vessels of the house of Jehovah shall be brought back from Babylon now shortly; for they prophesy a lie to you.
024	JER	027	017	Hearken ye not to them; serve the king of Babylon, and live! Why should this city become a desolation?
024	JER	027	018	But if they be indeed prophets, and if the word of Jehovah be with them, let them now make intercession to Jehovah of hosts, that the vessels which are left in the house of Jehovah, and in the house of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem, may not go to Babylon.
024	JER	027	019	For thus saith Jehovah of hosts concerning the pillars, and concerning the sea, and concerning the bases, and concerning the residue of the vessels that are let in this city,
024	JER	027	020	which Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, took not, when he carried away captive Jeconiah, the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, from Jerusalem to Babylon, with all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem;
024	JER	027	021	yea, thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels that are left in the house of Jehovah, and in the house of the king of Judah and of Jerusalem:
024	JER	027	022	They shall be carried to Babylon, and there shall they be until the day when I shall visit them, saith Jehovah. Then will I bring them up, and restore them to this place.
024	JER	028	001	And it came to pass in the same year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah, king of Judah, in the fourth year, in the fifth month, that Hananiah, the son of Azur the prophet, who was of Gibeon, spoke to me in the presence of the priests and of all the people, saying,
024	JER	028	002	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: “I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.
024	JER	028	003	Within two full years will I bring again to this place all the vessels of the house of Jehovah, which Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon took from this place, and carried to Babylon.
024	JER	028	004	And Jeconiah, the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and all the captives of Judah that went to Babylon, will I bring again to this place, saith Jehovah; for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.”
024	JER	028	005	Then Jeremiah the prophet spake to Hananiah the prophet, in the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people that stood in the house of Jehovah.
024	JER	028	006	And Jeremiah the prophet said, Amen! So may Jehovah do! May Jehovah fulfill thy words which thou hast prophesied, and bring back the vessels of the house of Jehovah, and all the captives from Babylon to this place!
024	JER	028	007	Nevertheless, hear now this word, which I speak in thine ears, and in the ears of all the people.
024	JER	028	008	The prophets who have been before me and before thee from ancient times have also prophesied against many nations, and against great kingdoms, of war, of calamity, and of pestilence.
024	JER	028	009	The prophet who prophesieth of peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to pass, then shall he be known as a prophet whom Jehovah hath truly sent.
024	JER	028	010	Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from the prophet Jeremiah's neck, and broke it.
024	JER	028	011	And Hananiah spake in the presence of all the people, saying, Thus saith Jehovah: In this manner will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, from the neck of all the nations, within the space of two full years. And the prophet Jeremiah went his way.
024	JER	028	012	Then came the word of Jehovah to Jeremiah, after that Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying:
024	JER	028	013	Go and tell Hananiah, saying: Thou hast broken a yoke of wood, but thou shalt make instead of it a yoke of iron.
024	JER	028	014	For thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: A yoke of iron do I put upon the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon; and they shall serve him. The beasts of the field also do I give to him.
024	JER	028	015	Jeremiah the prophet said also to Hananiah the prophet: Hear now, Hananiah! Jehovah hath not sent thee; but thou makest this people to trust in a lie.
024	JER	028	016	Therefore thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will cast thee off from the face of the earth. This year thou shalt die; for thou hast spoken rebellion against Jehovah.
024	JER	028	017	And Hananiah the prophet died in the same year, in the seventh month.
024	JER	029	001	Now these are the words of the letter which Jeremiah the prophet sent to the residue of the elders of the captivity, and to the priests, and to the prophets, and to all the people, whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon,
024	JER	029	002	after the departure of Jeconiah the king, and the queen, and the eunuchs, and the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, and the artificers, and the smiths, from Jerusalem,
024	JER	029	003	by the hand of Elasah, the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah, the son of Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah, the king of Judah, sent to Babylon, to Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, ) saying: —
024	JER	029	004	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, to all the captives whom I have caused to be carried away from Jerusalem to Babylon:
024	JER	029	005	Build ye houses and dwell in them; and plant gardens and eat the fruit of them.
024	JER	029	006	Take ye wives, and have sons and daughters; and take wives for your sons, and give your daughters to husbands, that they may bear sons and daughters; and increase ye there, and be not diminished.
024	JER	029	007	And seek ye the peace of the city whither I have caused you to be carried away captive, and pray for it to Jehovah, for in its peace shall be your peace.
024	JER	029	008	For thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Let not your prophets and your diviners, who are in the midst of you, deceive you, neither hearken to your dreams which ye cause to be dreamed.
024	JER	029	009	For they prophesy falsely to you in my name; I have not sent them, saith Jehovah.
024	JER	029	010	For thus saith Jehovah: Surely, when seventy years shall be completed for Babylon, I will visit you, and I will perform for you my good promise, that I would bring you again to this place.
024	JER	029	011	For I know the designs which I have in mind concerning you, designs of good and not of evil, to give you a happy end, and fulfill your hopes.
024	JER	029	012	Then ye shall call upon me, and go in peace; ye shall pray to me, and I will hear you;
024	JER	029	013	ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye search for me with all your heart.
024	JER	029	014	And I will be found by you, saith Jehovah, and I will bring you back from captivity, and I will gather you from all the nations, and from all the places whither I have driven you, saith Jehovah; and I will bring you again to the place whence I caused you to be carried away captive.
024	JER	029	015	Since ye say, Jehovah hath raised us up prophets in Babylon,
024	JER	029	016	behold, thus saith Jehovah concerning the king that sitteth upon the throne of David, and concerning all the people that dwell in this city, your brethren that went not forth with you into captivity, —
024	JER	029	017	thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Behold, I will send upon them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and I will make them like vile figs, which cannot be eaten for badness.
024	JER	029	018	And I will persecute them with the sword, and with famine, and with pestilence, and I will give them up to oppression in all kingdoms of the earth, to be a curse, and an astonishment, and a hissing, and a reproach, among all the nations whither I drive them;
024	JER	029	019	because they have not hearkened to my words, saith Jehovah, when I sent to them my servants, the prophets, rising early and sending them; but ye would not hear, saith Jehovah.
024	JER	029	020	Hear ye, therefore, the word of Jehovah, all ye of the captivity, whom I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon.
024	JER	029	021	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning Ahab, the son of Kolaiah, and concerning Zedekiah, the son of Maaseiah, who prophesy a lie to you in my name: Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, and he shall slay them before your eyes.
024	JER	029	022	And from them shall be taken a curse among all the captives of Judah that are at Babylon, so that they shall say, “Jehovah make thee like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire!”
024	JER	029	023	because they have practised villany in Israel, and have committed adultery with their neighbors' wives, and have spoken lying words in my name, which I commanded them not. But I know it, and am a witness, saith Jehovah.
024	JER	029	024	And to Shemaiah, the Nehelamite, shalt thou say,
024	JER	029	025	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Because thou hast sent letters in thy name to all the people that are at Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah, the son of Maaseiah the priest, and to all the priests, saying,
024	JER	029	026	Jehovah hath made thee priest in the room of Jehoiada the priest, that there should be officers in the house of Jehovah against every one that is mad and prophesieth, and that thou shouldst put him into the stocks, and into prison;
024	JER	029	027	now, therefore, why hast thou not reproved Jeremiah of Anathoth, who prophesieth to you?
024	JER	029	028	For he hath sent to us at Babylon, saying, This captivity is long. Build ye houses and dwell in them, and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them.
024	JER	029	029	And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet.
024	JER	029	030	Then came the word of Jehovah to Jeremiah, saying:
024	JER	029	031	Send to all those of the captivity, saying, Thus saith Jehovah concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite: Because Shemaiah the prophet hath prophesied to you, and I sent him not, and he hath caused you to trust in a lie,
024	JER	029	032	therefore thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will punish Shemaiah, the Nehelamite, and his offspring. There shall descend from him not a man to dwell among this people, and he shall not behold the good which I will do for my people, saith Jehovah; for he hath spoken rebellion against Jehovah.
024	JER	030	001	The word which came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying: —
024	JER	030	002	Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: Write thee all the words which I have spoken to thee in a book.
024	JER	030	003	For behold the days come, saith Jehovah, when I will bring back the captives of my people Israel and Judah, saith Jehovah, and cause them to return to the land which I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it.
024	JER	030	004	And these are the words which Jehovah spake concerning Israel and concerning Judah.
024	JER	030	005	Behold, thus saith Jehovah: The voice of trembling do we hear; There is alarm, and no peace.
024	JER	030	006	Ask ye now and see, Whether a male doth bring forth? Why then do I see every man's hands upon his loins, like a woman in travail? And why are all faces turned into paleness?
024	JER	030	007	Alas! that day is great, So that there is none like it; It is a time of trouble for Jacob, Yet shall he be saved from it.
024	JER	030	008	For in that day, saith Jehovah of hosts, I will break his yoke from his neck, And his bands will I burst asunder, And he shall be subject to strangers no more.
024	JER	030	009	But they shall serve Jehovah, their God, And David, their king, whom I will raise up for them.
024	JER	030	010	Therefore fear thou not, O my servant Jacob, saith Jehovah, And be not thou dismayed, O Israel! For, behold, I will bring thee safe from afar, And thy posterity from the land of their captivity; And Jacob shall return, and be at rest; Yea, he shall be quiet, and none shall make him afraid.
024	JER	030	011	For I will be with thee, saith Jehovah, to save thee; When I shall make a full end of all the nations Whither I have dispersed thee, Yet will I not make a full end of thee; I will correct thee in measure, Yet must I not leave thee wholly unpunished.
024	JER	030	012	For thus saith Jehovah: Thy bruise is incurable; Thy wound is mortal.
024	JER	030	013	No one offereth his help for thy cure; No healing medicines are applied to thee.
024	JER	030	014	All thy lovers have forgotten thee; They inquire not after thee. For with the wound of an enemy have I smitten thee, With the chastisement of a cruel one, For the multitude of thine iniquities, Because thy sins were increased.
024	JER	030	015	Why criest thou because of thy bruise? Thy pain is without remedy. For the multitude of thine iniquities, Because thy sins were increased, Have I done these things to thee.
024	JER	030	016	Yet all they that devour thee shall be devoured, And all thine enemies, yea, all of them, shall go into captivity, And they that spoil thee shall become a spoil, And all that plunder thee will I give up to plunder.
024	JER	030	017	For I will restore soundness to thee, And I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith Jehovah; For they have called thee the outcast, Zion, whom no man careth for.
024	JER	030	018	Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will bring back the captives of the tents of Jacob, And I will have pity upon his dwelling-places, And the city shall be builded upon her heap, And the palace shall be inhabited as of old.
024	JER	030	019	And out of them shall go forth thanksgiving, And the voice of them that make merry. And I will multiply them, and they shall not be few, And I will exalt them, and they shall not be low.
024	JER	030	020	And their children shall be as aforetime, And their congregation shall be established before me, And I will punish all that oppress them.
024	JER	030	021	And their princes shall be of themselves, And their governor shall proceed from the midst of them. And I will cause them to approach, and they shall come near to me; For who is he that would dare to come near to me? saith Jehovah.
024	JER	030	022	And ye shall be my people, And I will be your God.
024	JER	030	023	Behold, a whirlwind from Jehovah, Furious doth it go forth, Even a sweeping whirlwind; Upon the head of the wicked shall it rush.
024	JER	030	024	The fierce anger of Jehovah shall not turn back Until he shall have executed, until he shall have accomplished, the purpose of his heart; In a future day ye shall understand it fully.
024	JER	031	001	At that time, saith Jehovah, will I be the God of all the families of Israel, And they shall be my people.
024	JER	031	002	Thus saith Jehovah: The people, escaped from the sword, hath found favor in the wilderness; I will go and give rest to Israel.
024	JER	031	003	Jehovah appeared to me from afar, [[saying, ]] With an everlasting love do I love thee, Therefore have I kept mercy for thee.
024	JER	031	004	Again will I build thee, and thou shalt be built, O virgin of Israel! Again shalt thou adorn thy tabrets, And go forth in the dance of them that make merry.
024	JER	031	005	Thou shalt yet plant vines upon the mountains of Samaria; The planters shall plant, and eat the fruit.
024	JER	031	006	For the day is coming when the watchmen shall cry upon Mount Ephraim, Arise ye, and let us go up to Zion, To Jehovah, our God.
024	JER	031	007	For thus saith Jehovah: Sing with gladness for Jacob, And shout for the head of the nations! Publish ye, praise ye, and say: Jehovah, thou hast saved thy people, The remnant of Israel.
024	JER	031	008	Behold, I will bring them from the land of the North, And gather them from the extremities of the earth; And with them shall be the blind and the lame, The woman with child, and she that is in travail with child together; A great company shall return thither.
024	JER	031	009	They shall come with weeping, And amid supplications will I lead them; I will conduct them to streams of water, In a straight way, in which they shall not stumble. For I have become a father to Israel, And Ephraim is my first-born.
024	JER	031	010	Hear the word of Jehovah, O ye nations, And proclaim it in the distant coasts, and say: “He that scattered Israel will gather him, And will guard him, as a shepherd his flock.”
024	JER	031	011	For Jehovah hath redeemed Jacob, And ransomed him from the hand of him that was stronger than he.
024	JER	031	012	And they shall come and sing upon the height of Zion; They shall exult in the bounty of Jehovah, The corn, and the new wine, and the oil, And the young of the flock, and of the herd; And they shall be as a well-watered garden, And they shall languish no more.
024	JER	031	013	Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, And the young men and old men together, For I will change their mourning into joy; I will comfort them, and cheer them after their sorrow.
024	JER	031	014	And I will satisfy the priests with fatness, And my people shall be satisfied with my bounty, saith Jehovah.
024	JER	031	015	Thus saith Jehovah: A voice hath been heard in Ramah, Lamentation and bitter weeping; Rachel, weeping for her children, Refuseth to be comforted, because they are no more.
024	JER	031	016	Thus saith Jehovah: Refrain thy voice from weeping, And thine eyes from tears, For thy labor shall be rewarded, saith Jehovah; They shall come again from the land of the enemy.
024	JER	031	017	There is hope for thy future days, saith Jehovah; Thy children shall come again to their border.
024	JER	031	018	I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself: “Thou hast chastised me, and I was chastised, Like a steer not broken. Turn thou me, and I shall be turned, For thou, O Jehovah, art my God!
024	JER	031	019	Surely, after I returned, I repented, And after I was instructed, I smote upon my thigh; I was ashamed, yea, I was confounded, Because I bore the reproach of my youth.”
024	JER	031	020	Is Ephraim my dear son? Is he a beloved child? For as often as I speak of him, I do earnestly remember him still. My heart beateth for him; I will have mercy upon him, saith Jehovah.
024	JER	031	021	Set thee up waymarks; Raise thee pillars; Have regard to the highway, the way that thou goest! Return, O virgin of Israel, Return to these thy cities!
024	JER	031	022	How long wilt thou wander about, O rebellious daughter? Behold, Jehovah createth a new thing in the earth: The woman shall protect the man.
024	JER	031	023	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Again shall they say in the land of Judah, And in the cities thereof, when I bring back their captives, “May Jehovah bless thee, O habitation of justice, O holy mountain!”
024	JER	031	024	And Judah shall dwell in it, and all his cities together, Husbandmen, and they that go forth with their flocks.
024	JER	031	025	For I will refresh him that is thirsty, And I will satisfy him that languisheth.
024	JER	031	026	Upon this I awoke, and beheld, And my sleep was sweet to me.
024	JER	031	027	Behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, That I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah. With the seed of man, and with the seed of beast.
024	JER	031	028	And it shall be that as I have watched over them To pluck up, and to pull down, and to overthrow, And to destroy, and to afflict, So will I watch over them To build, and to plant, saith Jehovah.
024	JER	031	029	In those days they shall no more say, “The fathers have eaten sour grapes, And the children's teeth are set on edge.”
024	JER	031	030	But every one shall die for his own iniquity; Every man that eateth sour grapes, His teeth shall be set on edge.
024	JER	031	031	Behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, That I will make with the house of Israel, And with the house of Judah, a new covenant;
024	JER	031	032	Not according to the covenant which I made with their fathers, In the day when I took them by the hand To bring them out of the land of Egypt; Which covenant of mine they broke, And I rejected them, saith Jehovah.
024	JER	031	033	But this is the covenant which I will make with the house of Israel: After those days, saith Jehovah, I will put my law into their inward parts, And upon their hearts will I write it; And I will be their God, And they shall be my people.
024	JER	031	034	And they shall teach no more, Every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, Saying, “Know ye Jehovah!” For they shall all know me, From the least of them even to the greatest of them, saith Jehovah; For I will forgive their iniquity, And I will remember their sin no more.
024	JER	031	035	Thus saith Jehovah, Who made the sun for a light by day, And the ordinances of the moon and stars for a light by night, Who stirreth up the sea, so that the waves thereof roar, Jehovah of hosts is his name:
024	JER	031	036	If these ordinances shall depart from before me, Then shall the race of Israel also cease from being a nation before me forever.
024	JER	031	037	Thus saith Jehovah: If the heavens above can be measured, Or the foundations of the earth beneath searched out, Then will I cast off all the race of Israel For all which they have done, saith Jehovah.
024	JER	031	038	Behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, That the city shall be built to Jehovah From the tower of Hananeel to the corner-gate.
024	JER	031	039	And the measuring line shall go forth over against it even to the hill Gareb, And extend itself to Goath.
024	JER	031	040	And the whole valley of the dead bodies and of the ashes, And all the fields to the brook Kidron, Even to the corner of the horsegate toward the East, Shall be holy to Jehovah. No more shall it be plucked up, Or thrown down, forever.
024	JER	032	001	The word which came to Jeremiah from Jehovah in the tenth year of Zedekiah, the king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar.
024	JER	032	002	And at that time the army of the king of Babylon was laying siege to Jerusalem, and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the prison, which was in the house of the king of Judah.
024	JER	032	003	For Zedekiah, the king of Judah, had shut him up, saying, Wherefore dost thou prophesy, and say, “Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I am about to give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it;
024	JER	032	004	and Zedekiah, the king of Judah, shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldaeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes;
024	JER	032	005	and he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he be until I visit him, saith Jehovah; though ye fight with the Chaldaeans, ye shall not prosper?”
024	JER	032	006	Then said Jeremiah, The word of Jehovah came to me, and said:
024	JER	032	007	Behold, Hanameel, the son of Shallum, thine uncle, will come to thee, and say, Buy thee my field which is in Anathoth, for thine is the redemption-right to buy it.
024	JER	032	008	And so Hanameel, the son of my uncle, came to me in the court of the prison according to the word of Jehovah, and said to me: Buy, I pray thee, my field, which is in Anathoth, for thine is the right of inheritance and redemption; buy it for thyself! Then I knew that this was the word of Jehovah.
024	JER	032	009	I bought, therefore, the field of Hanameel, my uncle's son, in Anathoth, and I paid him the money, seventeen shekels of silver.
024	JER	032	010	And I wrote a deed, and sealed it, and took witnesses thereto, and weighed the silver in the balances.
024	JER	032	011	And I took the purchase-deed, that which was sealed according to the law and the statutes, and that which was open,
024	JER	032	012	and I gave the purchase-deed to Baruch, the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, in the presence of Hanameel, my uncle's son, and in the presence of the witnesses, who subscribed their names to the purchase-deed, and in the presence of all the Jews who sat in the court of the prison.
024	JER	032	013	And I charged Baruch in their presence, saying,
024	JER	032	014	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Take these writings, this sealed purchase-deed, and this open deed, and put them into an earthen vessel, that they may endure a great length of time.
024	JER	032	015	For thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Yet again shall houses and fields and vineyards be bought in this land.
024	JER	032	016	And when I had delivered the purchase-deed to Baruch, the son of Neriah, I prayed to Jehovah, saying,
024	JER	032	017	Ah, Lord, Jehovah! Behold, thou hast made the heavens and the earth by thy great power and thy stretched-out arm, and there is nothing too hard for thee.
024	JER	032	018	Thou showest kindness to a thousand generations, and recompensest the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of the children who come after them. The great, the mighty God, Jehovah of hosts is his name,
024	JER	032	019	great in counsel and mighty in work; for thine eyes are open upon all the ways of the sons of men, to give every one according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings;
024	JER	032	020	who hast displayed signs and wonders in the land of Egypt even to this day, and in Israel, and among other men, and hast made thee a name, as at this day;
024	JER	032	021	and hast brought forth thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with a stretched-out arm, and with great terror,
024	JER	032	022	and hast given them this land, which thou didst swear to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey;
024	JER	032	023	and they have come in and possessed it; but they have not obeyed thy voice, nor walked according to thy law. They have done nothing of all which thou commandedst them to do. Therefore hast thou caused all this evil to come upon them.
024	JER	032	024	Behold, the mounds of the enemy have already come up against the city to take it; and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldaeans, who fight against it by means of the sword, and of the famine, and of the pestilence; and what thou hast spoken is come to pass, and, behold, thou seest it.
024	JER	032	025	And yet hast thou said to me, O Lord Jehovah, “Buy thee the field for money, and take witnesses thereto!” when the city is given into the hand of the Chaldaeans.
024	JER	032	026	Then came the word of Jehovah to Jeremiah, saying:
024	JER	032	027	Behold, I, Jehovah, am the God of all flesh. Is there anything too hard for me?
024	JER	032	028	Therefore thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldaeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, and he shall take it.
024	JER	032	029	And the Chaldaeans who fight against this city shall come and set this city on fire, and burn it, with the houses upon whose roofs they have offered incense to Baal, and poured out incense to other gods, to provoke me to anger.
024	JER	032	030	For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have done nothing but evil before me from their youth; yea, the children of Israel have but provoked me to anger with the work of their hands, saith Jehovah.
024	JER	032	031	For this city hath been the object of my anger and my fury, from the day when they built it even to this day; that I might remove it from before my face,
024	JER	032	032	because of all the wickedness of the children of Israel, and of the children of Judah, which they have committed to provoke me to anger, they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
024	JER	032	033	For they have turned to me the back, and not the face; though I have taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet have they not hearkened to receive instruction.
024	JER	032	034	And they have set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to defile it.
024	JER	032	035	And they have built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire to Moloch, which I commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they should practise their abomination, to cause Judah to sin.
024	JER	032	036	Yet now thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel concerning this city, of which ye say, “It is delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence.”
024	JER	032	037	Behold, I will gather them out of all the countries whither I have driven them in my anger and my fury and my great wrath, and I will bring them back to this place, and I will cause them to dwell securely,
024	JER	032	038	and they shall be my people, and I will be their God.
024	JER	032	039	And I will give them one heart, and one way, to fear me continually, that it may be well with them, and with their children after them.
024	JER	032	040	And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them, nor cease to do them good; for I will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me.
024	JER	032	041	Yea, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land in truth, with my whole heart, and with my whole soul.
024	JER	032	042	For thus saith Jehovah: As I have brought upon this people all this great evil, so will I bring upon them all the good which I have promised them.
024	JER	032	043	And fields shall yet be bought in this land, of which ye say, “It is desolate, without man or beast; it is given into the hand of the Chaldaeans.”
024	JER	032	044	Fields shall men buy for money, and subscribe deeds, and seal them, and take witnesses, in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the hill-country, and in the cities of the valley, and in the cities of the south; for I will bring them back from their captivity, saith Jehovah.
024	JER	033	001	The word of Jehovah came also to Jeremiah the second time, while he was shut up in the court of the prison, and said: —
024	JER	033	002	Thus saith Jehovah, who doeth it, Jehovah who disposeth it, to establish it; Jehovah is his name.
024	JER	033	003	Call to me, and I will answer thee, And I will show thee great things, And hidden things which thou knowest not.
024	JER	033	004	For thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Concerning the houses of this city, And concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, Which are thrown down toward the mounds and the sword,
024	JER	033	005	To fight with the Chaldaeans, And to fill them with the dead bodies of men, Whom I have smitten in mine anger and in my wrath, And for all whose wickedness I have hid my face from this city:
024	JER	033	006	Behold, I will bind up her wounds, and heal them, And I will reveal to them abundance of peace and stability.
024	JER	033	007	And I will bring back the captives of Judah, And the captives of Israel, And I will build them, as at the first.
024	JER	033	008	And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, Whereby they have sinned against me; And I will forgive all their iniquities, Whereby they have sinned, And have rebelled against me.
024	JER	033	009	And it [[the city]] shall be to me a name of joy, A praise and a glory among all the nations of the earth, Who shall hear of all the good which I do to them. And they shall fear and tremble because of all the good, And because of all the prosperity, which I bestow upon it.
024	JER	033	010	Thus saith Jehovah: Yet again shall be heard in this place, Of which ye say, “It is desolate, without man and without beast,” In the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, Which are desolate, without man, Even without an inhabitant and without beast,
024	JER	033	011	The voice of joy and the voice of gladness, The voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, The voice of them that say, “Praise ye Jehovah of hosts, For Jehovah is good, For his mercy endureth forever!” And of them that bring an offering of praise to the house of Jehovah. For I will restore the captives of the land, As at the first, saith Jehovah.
024	JER	033	012	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Yet again shall there be in this place, Which is desolate, without man and without beast, And in all the cities thereof, A habitation of shepherds, who shall cause their flocks to rest;
024	JER	033	013	In the cities of the hill-country, and in the cities of the plain, And in the cities of the south, and in the land of Benjamin, And in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, Shall the flocks pass yet again Under the hands of him that numbereth them, saith Jehovah.
024	JER	033	014	Behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, That I will perform that good thing Which I have spoken concerning the house of Israel, And concerning the house of Judah.
024	JER	033	015	In those days and at that time Will I cause to grow up from David a righteous branch, Who shall maintain justice and equity in the land.
024	JER	033	016	In those days shall Judah be saved, And Jerusalem shall dwell securely; And this is the name which shall be given her, Jehovah-is-our-salvation.
024	JER	033	017	For thus saith Jehovah: There shall never fail from David A man to sit upon the throne of the house of Israel;
024	JER	033	018	Neither from the priests and the Levites Shall a man fail before me, To offer burnt-offerings, and to kindle meat-offerings, And to perform sacrifice continually.
024	JER	033	019	And the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah and said,
024	JER	033	020	Thus saith Jehovah: If ye can break my covenant concerning the day, And my covenant concerning the night, So that there shall no more be day and night in their season,
024	JER	033	021	Then also may my covenant with David my servant be broken, So that he shall not have a son to reign upon his throne, And with the Levites, the priests, my servants.
024	JER	033	022	As the host of heaven cannot be numbered, Nor the sand of the sea measured, So will I multiply the posterity of David my servant, And the Levites who minister to me.
024	JER	033	023	The word of Jehovah came also to Jeremiah, saying:
024	JER	033	024	Seest thou not what this people speaketh, saying, “The two families, which Jehovah chose, he hath cast off”? Therefore they despise my people, So that they are no more a people in their eyes.
024	JER	033	025	Thus saith Jehovah: If my covenant concerning the day and the night be not maintained, And if I have not established the ordinances of the heaven and the earth,
024	JER	033	026	Then will I cast away the posterity of Jacob, and of David, my servant, So as not to take of his posterity to be rulers Over the posterity of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; For I will bring them back from their captivity, And have mercy upon them.
024	JER	034	001	The word which came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, when Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, and all his army, and all the kingdoms of the earth that were under his dominion, and all the nations, made war against Jerusalem, and against all the cities thereof, saying: —
024	JER	034	002	Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: Go and speak to Zedekiah, the king of Judah, and say to him, Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire.
024	JER	034	003	And thou shalt not escape out of his hand, but shalt surely be taken and delivered into his hand; and thine eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth, and thou shalt go to Babylon.
024	JER	034	004	Yet hear the word of Jehovah, O Zedekiah, king of Judah! Thus saith Jehovah concerning thee: Thou shalt not die by the sword;
024	JER	034	005	in peace shalt thou die; and according to the burnings of thy fathers, the former kings, who were before thee, so shall they burn for thee; and they shall lament for thee, saying, “Ah, lord!” for I have spoken the word, saith Jehovah.
024	JER	034	006	And Jeremiah the prophet spake all these words to Zedekiah, king of Judah, at Jerusalem.
024	JER	034	007	And the army of the king of Babylon fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish, and against Azekah; for these fortified cities remained of the cities of Judah.
024	JER	034	008	The word which came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, after King Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people that were at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty to them,
024	JER	034	009	that every one should let his man-servant or his maid-servant, being a Hebrew or Hebrewess, go free, that no one should retain his brother, a Jew, in servitude.
024	JER	034	010	And all the princes, and all the people, who had entered into covenant to let every one his man-servant and every one his maid-servant go free, and retain them in servitude no longer, obeyed; they obeyed, and let them go.
024	JER	034	011	But they returned afterwards, and took back the men-servants and the maid-servants whom they had let go free, and brought them into subjection as men-servants and as maid-servants.
024	JER	034	012	Then came the word of Jehovah to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,
024	JER	034	013	Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: I made a covenant with your fathers in the day when I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondmen, and said,
024	JER	034	014	“At the end of seven years ye shall let go every man his brother, a Hebrew, who shall have been sold to thee; when he shall have served thee six years, thou shalt let him go free from thee.” But your fathers hearkened not to me, nor inclined their ear.
024	JER	034	015	And when ye had turned at this time, and had done what was right in mine eyes, in proclaiming liberty every one to his neighbor, and had entered into a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name,
024	JER	034	016	then ye returned and profaned my name, and took back every one his man-servant, and every one his maid-servant, whom he had set at liberty at their pleasure, and brought them into subjection to be men-servants and maid-servants to you.
024	JER	034	017	Therefore thus saith Jehovah: Ye have not hearkened to me in proclaiming liberty every one to his brother, and every one to his neighbor. Behold, I proclaim a liberty for you, saith Jehovah, to the sword, to pestilence, and to famine, and I will give you up to oppression in all the kingdoms of the earth;
024	JER	034	018	and I will make the men who have transgressed my covenant, who have not performed the words of the covenant which they made before me, like the calf which they cut in twain, and passed between the parts thereof,
024	JER	034	019	the princes of Judah, and the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, and the priests, and all the people of the land, that passed between the parts of the calf.
024	JER	034	020	I will give them into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life; and their dead bodies shall be food for the birds of heaven, and for the beasts of the earth.
024	JER	034	021	And Zedekiah, king of Judah, and his princes, will I give into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life, even into the hand of the king of Babylon's army, which are gone up from you.
024	JER	034	022	Behold, I will command, saith Jehovah, and cause them to return to this city, and they shall fight against it, and take it, and burn it with fire; and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation without an inhabitant.
024	JER	035	001	The word which came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, in the days of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, king of Judah, saying:
024	JER	035	002	Go to the house of the Rechabites, and speak to them, and bring them into the house of Jehovah, into one of the chambers, and give them wine to drink.
024	JER	035	003	Then I took Jaazaniah, the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habaziniah, and his brethren, and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites,
024	JER	035	004	and brought them into the house of Jehovah, into the chamber of the sons of Hanan, the son of Igdaliah, a man of God, which was by the chamber of the princes, which was above the chamber of Maaseiah, the son of Shallum, the keeper of the door.
024	JER	035	005	And I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites pots full of wine and cups, and I said to them, “Drink ye wine.”
024	JER	035	006	But they said, “We will not drink wine; for Jonadab, the son of Rechab, our father, commanded us, saying, Ye shall drink no wine, ye nor your sons, forever;
024	JER	035	007	neither shall ye build house, nor sow seed, nor plant vineyard, nor have any; but all your days ye shall dwell in tents, that ye may live long in the land wherein ye are strangers.
024	JER	035	008	And we have obeyed the voice of Jonadab, the son of Rechab, our father, in all that he charged us, to drink no wine all our days, neither we, nor our wives, nor our sons, nor our daughters;
024	JER	035	009	nor to build houses for us to dwell in; neither have we vineyard, nor field, nor seed;
024	JER	035	010	but we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed, and done according to all that Jonadab, the son of Rechab, our father, commanded us.
024	JER	035	011	But it came to pass when Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, came up into the land, that we said, Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldaeans, and for fear of the army of the Syrians; so we dwell at Jerusalem.”
024	JER	035	012	Then came the word of Jehovah to Jeremiah, saying,
024	JER	035	013	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Go and say to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem: Will ye not receive instruction, to hearken to my words? saith Jehovah.
024	JER	035	014	The words of Jonadab, the son of Rechab, in which he commanded his sons not to drink wine, have been performed; for they have drunk no wine to this day, but have obeyed the commandment of their father. I also have spoken to you, rising up early and speaking, but ye have not hearkened to me.
024	JER	035	015	And I have sent to you all my servants, the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, Return ye now every one from his evil way, and amend your doings, and go not after other gods to serve them, and ye shall dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers; but ye have not inclined your ear, nor hearkened to me.
024	JER	035	016	Since then the sons of Jonadab, the son of Rechab, have performed the commandment of their father which he commanded them, and this people have not hearkened to me;
024	JER	035	017	therefore thus saith Jehovah, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will bring upon Judah, and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, all the evil which I have pronounced against them; because I have spoken to them, and they have not hearkened, and I have called to them, and they have not answered.
024	JER	035	018	And to the house of the Rechabites Jeremiah said: Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Because ye have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab, your father, and kept all his precepts, and done according to all which he commanded you,
024	JER	035	019	therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: There shall not fail in the land of Jonadab, the son of Rechab, men to stand before me forever.
024	JER	036	001	And it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, king of Judah, that this word came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying:
024	JER	036	002	Take thee a book-roll, and write upon it all the words which I have spoken to thee concerning Israel, and concerning Judah, and concerning all the nations, from the day when I began to speak to thee even to this day.
024	JER	036	003	It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do to them, and return every one from his evil way, so that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin.
024	JER	036	004	Then Jeremiah called Baruch, the son of Neriah; and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of Jehovah which he had spoken to him, upon a book-roll.
024	JER	036	005	And Jeremiah commanded Baruch and said: I am shut up; I cannot go into the house of Jehovah;
024	JER	036	006	therefore, go thou, and read in the roll which thou hast written from my mouth the words of Jehovah, in the ears of the people, in the house of Jehovah, upon the fast-day; also in the ears of all Judah, that come out of their cities, shalt thou read them.
024	JER	036	007	It may be that they will prostrate themselves in supplication before Jehovah, and will return every one from his evil way. For great is the anger and the indignation which Jehovah hath denounced against this people.
024	JER	036	008	And Baruch, the son of Neriah, did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading in the book the words of Jehovah in the house of Jehovah.
024	JER	036	009	And it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, king of Judah, in the ninth month, that all the people in Jerusalem, and all the people that came out of the cities of Judah, proclaimed a fast before Jehovah, in Jerusalem.
024	JER	036	010	Then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of Jehovah, in the chamber of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the higher court, at the entrance of the new gate of the house of Jehovah, in the ears of all the people.
024	JER	036	011	And when Micah, the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard from the book all the words of Jehovah,
024	JER	036	012	he went down to the king's house, into the scribe's chamber; and lo, all the princes were sitting there, Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah, the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan, the son of Achbor, and Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah, the son of Hananiah, and all the princes.
024	JER	036	013	Then Micah declared to them all the words which he had heard when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people.
024	JER	036	014	Then all the princes sent Jehudi, the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, to Baruch, and said, “Take in thy hand the roll wherein thou hast read in the ears of the people, and come.” So Baruch, the son of Neriah, took the roll in his hand, and came to them.
024	JER	036	015	And they said to him, “Sit down now, and read it in our ears.” And Baruch read it in their ears.
024	JER	036	016	And when they had heard all the words, they looked with consternation upon one another, and they said to Baruch, “We must tell the king of all these things.”
024	JER	036	017	And they asked Baruch, saying, “Tell us now, how didst thou write all these words from his mouth?”
024	JER	036	018	And Baruch said to them, “With his mouth he pronounced to me all these words, and I wrote them on the book with ink.”
024	JER	036	019	Then said the princes to Baruch, “Go, hide thee, thou and Jeremiah, and let no man know where ye are.”
024	JER	036	020	And they went in to the king into the court; but they laid up the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and they told all these things in the ears of the king.
024	JER	036	021	Then the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll, and he took it out of the chamber of Elishama the scribe; and Jehudi read it in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the princes who stood beside the king.
024	JER	036	022	And the king was sitting in the winter-house, in the ninth month, and a brasier was burning before him.
024	JER	036	023	And when Jehudi had read three or four sections, he [[the king]] cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire, into the brasier, until the whole roll was consumed in the fire in the brasier.
024	JER	036	024	And they were not afraid, and rent not their garments, neither the king, nor any of his servants, who heard all these words;
024	JER	036	025	and although Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah interceded with the king not to burn the roll, yet he would not hearken to them.
024	JER	036	026	And the king commanded Jerahmeel, the son of Hammelech, and Seraiah, the son of Azreel, and Shelemiah, the son of Abdeel, to seize Baruch the scribe, and Jeremiah the prophet; but Jehovah had hid them.
024	JER	036	027	Then came the word of Jehovah to Jeremiah, after that the king had burned the roll, and the words which Baruch had written from the mouth of Jeremiah, saying:
024	JER	036	028	Take thee another roll, and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll, which Jehoiakim, king of Judah, hath burned.
024	JER	036	029	And concerning Jehoiakim, king of Judah, thou shalt say, Thou hast burned this roll, saying, “Why hast thou written therein and said, The king of Babylon shall surely come and shall destroy this land, and shall cause to cease from it man and beast?”
024	JER	036	030	Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning Jehoiakim, king of Judah: He shall have not one to sit upon the throne of David; and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost.
024	JER	036	031	And I will punish him, and his offspring, and his servants, for their iniquity; and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, all the evil which I have pronounced against them, and they have not hearkened.
024	JER	036	032	Then Jeremiah took another roll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah, who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim had burned in the fire; and there were added to them many words of the same kind.
024	JER	037	001	Now King Zedekiah, the son of Josiah, reigned instead of Coniah, the son of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, made king in the land of Judah.
024	JER	037	002	But neither he nor his servants nor the people of the land regarded the words of Jehovah, which he spake by the prophet Jeremiah.
024	JER	037	003	And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal, the son of Shelemiah, and Zephaniah, the son of Maaseiah the priest, to Jeremiah the prophet, saying, “Pray now to Jehovah our God for us.”
024	JER	037	004	Now Jeremiah came in and went out among the people, for they had not cast him into prison.
024	JER	037	005	And Pharaoh's army had come forth out of Egypt; and the Chaldaeans, who were besieging Jerusalem, having heard tidings of them, had departed from Jerusalem.
024	JER	037	006	Then came the word of Jehovah to Jeremiah the prophet, saying,
024	JER	037	007	Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: Thus shall ye say to the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of me: Behold, the army of Pharaoh, which is come forth to help you, shall return to Egypt, into their own land.
024	JER	037	008	And the Chaldaeans shall come again, and fight against this city, and take it, and burn it with fire.
024	JER	037	009	Thus saith Jehovah: Deceive not yourselves, saying, “The Chaldaeans shall surely depart from us”; for they shall not depart.
024	JER	037	010	For though ye had smitten the whole army of the Chaldaeans that fight against you, and there remained only wounded men among them, each one in his tent, yet should they rise up and burn this city with fire.
024	JER	037	011	And it came to pass, when the army of the Chaldaeans had marched away from Jerusalem because of the army of Pharaoh,
024	JER	037	012	that Jeremiah was going forth from Jerusalem, to go into the land of Benjamin, to receive thence his inheritance among the people.
024	JER	037	013	And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the ward was there, whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he seized Jeremiah the prophet, saying, “Thou art going over to the Chaldaeans.”
024	JER	037	014	And Jeremiah said, “It is false; I am not going over to the Chaldaeans.” But he hearkened not to him; so Irijah took Jeremiah and brought him to the princes.
024	JER	037	015	And the princes were enraged against Jeremiah, and smote him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe; for they had made that a prison.
024	JER	037	016	And when Jeremiah had gone into the dungeon, and into the cells, and had remained there a long time,
024	JER	037	017	then Zedekiah the king sent and took him out; and the king asked him in his house privately, and said, “Hast thou any word from Jehovah?” And Jeremiah said, “I have.” And he said, “Into the hand of the king of Babylon shalt thou be delivered.”
024	JER	037	018	And Jeremiah said to King Zedekiah, What offence have I committed against thee, or against thy servants, or against this people, that ye have put me in prison?
024	JER	037	019	And where are your prophets, who prophesied to you, saying, “The king of Babylon shall not come against you, nor against this land?”
024	JER	037	020	But now hear, I pray thee, my lord the king! let my supplication, I pray thee, be accepted before thee, and cause me not to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there!
024	JER	037	021	Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit Jeremiah into the court of the prison, and that they should give him daily a piece of bread out of the bakers' street, until all the bread in the city should be consumed. And Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.
024	JER	038	001	And Shephatiah, the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah, the son of Pashur, and Jucal, the son of Shelemiah, and Pashur, the son of Malchiah, heard the words which Jeremiah spoke to all the people, saying,
024	JER	038	002	“Thus saith Jehovah: He that remaineth in this city shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence; but he that goeth forth to the Chaldaeans shall live, and he shall retain his life as a prey, and shall live.
024	JER	038	003	Thus saith Jehovah: This city shall surely be given into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it.”
024	JER	038	004	Then said the princes to the king, “We beseech thee, let this man be put to death! for thus he weakeneth the hands of the men of war that remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in speaking such words to them; for this man seeketh not the welfare of this people, but their hurt.”
024	JER	038	005	Then Zedekiah the king said, “Behold, he is in your hand; for the king is not one that can do anything in opposition to you.”
024	JER	038	006	Then took they Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of Malchiah, the son of Hammelech, which was in the court of the prison; and they let down Jeremiah with cords. And in the dungeon there was no water, but only mire; and Jeremiah sunk in the mire.
024	JER	038	007	And Ebedmelech, the Ethiopian, a eunuch, who was then in the king's house, heard that they had put Jeremiah into the dungeon; and the king was sitting in the gate of Benjamin.
024	JER	038	008	Then Ebedmelech went forth out of the king's house, and spake to the king, saying,
024	JER	038	009	“My lord the king! these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet whom they have cast into the dungeon; for he was already almost dead in his place for hunger; for there is no more bread in the city.”
024	JER	038	010	Then the king commanded Ebedmelech, the Ethiopian, saying, “Take along with thee thirty men from hence, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon, before he die.”
024	JER	038	011	And Ebedmelech took the men with him, and went into the king's house under the store-room, and took from thence torn rags and worn-out rags, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah.
024	JER	038	012	And Ebedmelech, the Ethiopian, said to Jeremiah, put now these torn and worn-out rags under thy knuckles under the cords. And Jeremiah did so.
024	JER	038	013	And they drew up Jeremiah with cords, and took him up out of the dungeon; and Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.
024	JER	038	014	And King Zedekiah sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet to him into the third entrance, which is in the house of Jehovah; and the king said to Jeremiah, “I will ask thee a question; hide nothing from me!”
024	JER	038	015	And Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “When I have told thee, wilt thou not surely put me to death? and if I give thee counsel, thou wilt not hearken to me.”
024	JER	038	016	Then King Zedekiah swore to Jeremiah in secret, saying, “As Jehovah liveth, who made for us this soul, I will not put thee to death, neither will I give thee into the hand of these men that seek thy life.”
024	JER	038	017	Then said Jeremiah to Zedekiah, “Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: If thou wilt go forth to the chieftains of the king of Babylon, then shalt thou live; and this city shall not be burned with fire; and thou shalt live, thou and thine house.
024	JER	038	018	But if thou wilt not go forth to the chieftains of the king of Babylon, then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldaeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and thou shalt not escape out of their hand.”
024	JER	038	019	And Zedekiah the king said to Jeremiah, “I am afraid of the Jews who have gone over to the Chaldaeans, lest I should be delivered into their hand, and they should mock me.”
024	JER	038	020	And Jeremiah said, “Thou shalt not be delivered up to them. Obey, I beseech thee, the voice of Jehovah in what I speak to thee; so shall it be well with thee, and thou shalt live.
024	JER	038	021	But if thou refuse to go forth, this is what Jehovah hath revealed to me.
024	JER	038	022	Behold, all the women that are left in the house of the king of Judah shall be brought forth to the chieftains of the king of Babylon, and shall say, 'Thy friends have set thee on, and have prevailed against thee; thy feet are sunk in the mire; they go backward.'
024	JER	038	023	And all thy wives and thy children shall they bring out to the Chaldaeans, and thou shalt not escape out of their hand, but by the hand of the king of Babylon shalt thou be taken; and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire.”
024	JER	038	024	Then said Zedekiah to Jeremiah, “Let no man know of these words, and thou shalt not die.
024	JER	038	025	But if the princes shall hear that I have talked with thee, and shall come to thee, and say to thee, 'Tell us, we pray thee, what thou hast said to the king; hide it not from us, and we will not put thee to death; and what the king hath said to thee';
024	JER	038	026	then shalt thou say to them, 'I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to return to the house of Jonathan to die there.'”
024	JER	038	027	Then came all the princes to Jeremiah, and asked him; and he told them according to all those words which the king had commanded. And they said no more to him, for the matter was not known.
024	JER	038	028	And Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison to the day when Jerusalem was taken.
024	JER	039	001	And it came to pass, when Jerusalem was taken, (in the ninth year of Zedekiah, the king of Judah, in the tenth month, came Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, and all his army, against Jerusalem, and besieged it;
024	JER	039	002	and in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, on the ninth day of the month, was the city broken into, )
024	JER	039	003	that all the chieftains of the king of Babylon came, and stationed themselves in the middle gate, Nergalsharezer, Samgarnebo, Sarsechim, prefect of the eunuchs, Nergalsharezer, prefect of the magians, and all the rest of the princes of the king of Babylon.
024	JER	039	004	And when Zedekiah, the king of Judah, and all the men of war, saw them, they fled, and went forth out of the city by night, by the way of the king's garden, through the gate between the two walls; and they went forth toward the plain.
024	JER	039	005	But the army of the Chaldaeans pursued them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and they took him, and brought him to Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, at Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he gave judgment concerning him.
024	JER	039	006	And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah at Riblah before his eyes; and all the nobles of Judah did the king of Babylon slay.
024	JER	039	007	And he put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him with fetters of brass, to carry him to Babylon.
024	JER	039	008	And the Chaldaeans burned the king's house, and the houses of the people, with fire, and they broke down the walls of Jerusalem.
024	JER	039	009	And the residue of the people that remained in the city, and the deserters who had come over to him, the residue of the people that remained, Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, carried away to Babylon.
024	JER	039	010	But the poor of the people, who had nothing, Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, left in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time.
024	JER	039	011	And Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, saying,
024	JER	039	012	“Take him, and have thine eyes upon him, and do him no harm; but do to him even as he shall say to you.”
024	JER	039	013	Then sent Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, and Nebushasban, prefect of the eunuchs, and Nergalsharezer, prefect of the magians, and all the princes of the king of Babylon,
024	JER	039	014	they sent and took Jeremiah out of the court of the prison, and committed him to Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, that he should carry him home; and he dwelt among the people.
024	JER	039	015	Now the word of Jehovah had come to Jeremiah, while he was shut up in the court of the prison, saying:
024	JER	039	016	Go and speak to Ebedmelech, the Ethiopian, and say: Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I bring my words upon this city for evil and not for good, and with thine own eyes shalt thou see it in that day.
024	JER	039	017	But I will deliver thee in that day, saith Jehovah; and thou shalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou art afraid.
024	JER	039	018	But I will surely deliver thee, and thou shalt not fall by the sword, but thy life shall be to thee as a prey; because thou hast put thy trust in me, saith Jehovah.
024	JER	040	001	The word which came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, after that Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, had let him go from Ramah. For he had taken him, and he had been bound with chains among all the captives of Jerusalem and Judah which were carried away captive to Babylon.
024	JER	040	002	And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said to him: “Jehovah, thy God, pronounced this evil against this place;
024	JER	040	003	and now Jehovah hath brought it, and done according as he spake, because ye sinned against Jehovah, and obeyed not his voice; therefore hath this thing come upon you.
024	JER	040	004	And now, behold, I loose thee this day from the chains upon thy hands. If it seem good to thee to come with me to Babylon, come; and I will set my eyes upon thee; but if it seem evil to thee to come with me to Babylon, forbear; behold, the whole land is before thee; whither it seemeth good and desirable for thee to go, thither go.”
024	JER	040	005	And while he was not yet gone away [[he said]]: “Go to Gedaliah, the of son Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon hath made governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people; or go whithersoever it seemeth good to thee to go.” And the captain of the guard gave him provisions, and a present, and dismissed him.
024	JER	040	006	And Jeremiah went to Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, to Mizpah, and dwelt with him among the people that were left in the land.
024	JER	040	007	Now when all the captains of the forces which were in the fields, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, governor over the land, and had committed to his charge men and women and children, of the poor of the land, of them that were not carried away captive to Babylon,
024	JER	040	008	then they came to Gedaliah, to Mizpah; namely, Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan, the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah, the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah, the son of the Maachathite, they and their men;
024	JER	040	009	and Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, swore to them and to their men, saying, “Fear not to serve the Chaldaeans; dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.
024	JER	040	010	As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah, to stand before the Chaldaeans, who shall come to us; but ye, gather ye in wine, and summer fruits, and oil, and put them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities which ye have taken.”
024	JER	040	011	Also when all the Jews that were in Moab, and among the children of Ammon, and in Edom, and that were in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant to Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan,
024	JER	040	012	then all the Jews returned from all the places whither they were driven, and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, to Mizpah, and gathered wine and summer fruits in abundance.
024	JER	040	013	And Johanan, the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were in the fields, came to Gedaliah, to Mizpah,
024	JER	040	014	and said to him, “Dost thou know that Baalis, the king of the children of Ammon, hath sent Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, to slay thee?” But Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, believed them not.
024	JER	040	015	And Johanan, the son of Kareah, spake to Gedaliah in private at Mizpah, saying, “Let me go, I pray thee, and smite Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, and no man shall know it. Wherefore should he slay thee, that all the Jews which are gathered to thee should be scattered, and the remnant in Judah perish?”
024	JER	040	016	But Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, said to Johanan, the son of Kareah, “Thou shalt not do this thing, for thou speakest falsely of Ishmael.”
024	JER	041	001	And it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the blood royal, and one of the great officers of the king, and ten men with him, came to Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, to Mizpah; and they ate bread there together in Mizpah.
024	JER	041	002	Then Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, arose, and the ten men that were with him, and smote Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, with the sword, and slew him whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land.
024	JER	041	003	And all the Jews that were with him, with Gedaliah at Mizpah, and the Chaldaeans that were found there, the men of war, did Ishmael smite.
024	JER	041	004	And it came to pass, the second day after he had slain Gedaliah, and no man knew it,
024	JER	041	005	that there came certain men from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, fourscore persons, having their beards shaven, and their clothes rent, and having cut themselves, with an oblation and incense in their hands, to bring to the house of Jehovah.
024	JER	041	006	And Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, went forth from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as he went; and when he met them, he said to them, “Come ye to Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam.”
024	JER	041	007	And when they had come into the midst of the city, Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, slew them, and cast them into the pit, he and the men that were with him.
024	JER	041	008	But ten men were found among them who said to Ishmael, “Slay us not, for we have hidden stores in the field, of wheat, and barley, and oil, and honey.” He forbore, therefore, and slew them not with their brethren.
024	JER	041	009	Now the pit into which Ishmael cast all the dead bodies of the men whom he slew, together with Gedaliah, is the same which King Asa made on account of Baasha, king of Israel; and Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, filled it with them that were slain.
024	JER	041	010	And Ishmael took captive all the residue of the people that were in Mizpah, the king's daughters, and all the people that remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, had committed to the charge of Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam; even Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, took them captive, and set forth to go over [[the Jordan]] to the children of Ammon.
024	JER	041	011	But when Johanan, the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, heard of all the evil which Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, had done,
024	JER	041	012	they took all the men, and went up to fight with Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, and came up with him at the great waters that are in Gibeon.
024	JER	041	013	And when all the people which were with Ishmael saw Johanan, the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, they were glad;
024	JER	041	014	and all the people that Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah faced about and returned, and went to Johanan, the son of Kareah.
024	JER	041	015	But Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to the children of Ammon.
024	JER	041	016	Then took Johanan, the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, from Mizpah, after he had slain Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, strong men, men of war, and women, and children, and eunuchs, whom he had brought back from Gibeon;
024	JER	041	017	and they went, and tarried in the inn of Chimham, which is near Bethlehem, in order to flee into Egypt
024	JER	041	018	from the Chaldaeans; for they were afraid of them, because Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, had slain Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land.
024	JER	042	001	And all the captains of the forces, and Johanan, the son of Kareah, and Jezaniah, the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people, from the least even to the greatest, came near,
024	JER	042	002	and said to Jeremiah the prophet: “Let, we beseech thee, our supplication be accepted before thee, and pray for us to Jehovah, thy God, for all this remnant; (for we are left a few out of many, as thine eyes do behold us; )
024	JER	042	003	that Jehovah, thy God, may show us the way wherein we shall walk, and the thing which we shall do.”
024	JER	042	004	And Jeremiah the prophet said to them: “I have heard; behold, I will pray to Jehovah your God, according to your words, and all which Jehovah shall answer you I will declare to you; I will keep back nothing from you.”
024	JER	042	005	Then they said to Jeremiah: “May Jehovah be our witness, a faithful and true witness! According to all for which Jehovah our God shall send thee to us, so will we do.
024	JER	042	006	Whether it be good, or whether it be evil, we will obey the voice of Jehovah our God, to whom we send thee, that it may be well with us when we shall have obeyed the voice of Jehovah our God.”
024	JER	042	007	And it came to pass after ten days, that the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah.
024	JER	042	008	And he called Johanan, the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces which were with him, and all the people, from the least even to the greatest,
024	JER	042	009	and said to them: “Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, to whom ye sent me to present your supplication before him:
024	JER	042	010	If ye will still abide in this land, then will I build you, and not pull you down, and I will plant you, and not pluck you up; for I repent me of the evil which I have done to you.
024	JER	042	011	Be not afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom ye are afraid; be not afraid of him, saith Jehovah; for I will be with you to save you, and to deliver you from his hand.
024	JER	042	012	And I will show mercies to you, that he may have compassion upon you, and cause you to return to your own land.
024	JER	042	013	But if ye say, 'We will not dwell in this land,' so as not to hearken to the voice of Jehovah your God,
024	JER	042	014	saying, 'No! but we will go into the land of Egypt, where we shall see no war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor be hungry for bread, and there will we dwell, —
024	JER	042	015	now, therefore, hear the word of Jehovah, ye remnant of Judah! Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: If ye set your faces to enter into Egypt, and go to sojourn there,
024	JER	042	016	then it shall come to pass that the sword, which ye feared, shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt, and the famine, of which ye were afraid, shall follow close after you into Egypt, and there shall ye die.
024	JER	042	017	So shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into Egypt to sojourn there. They shall die by the sword, and by famine, and by pestilence, and not one of them shall remain, or escape from the evil which I bring upon them.
024	JER	042	018	For thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: As my anger and my wrath have been poured forth upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so shall my wrath be poured forth upon you, when ye shall enter into Egypt; and ye shall be an execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach; and ye shall see this place no more.
024	JER	042	019	This is the word of Jehovah to you, ye remnant of Judah! Go ye not into Egypt; ye shall surely know that I have warned you this day.
024	JER	042	020	Ye err to your own ruin; for ye sent me to Jehovah your God, saying, 'Pray for us to Jehovah our God, and according to all that Jehovah our God shall say, so declare to us, and we will do it';
024	JER	042	021	and now I have this day declared it to you, but ye have not hearkened to the voice of Jehovah your God, nor to anything for which he sent me to you.
024	JER	042	022	Now, therefore, ye shall know assuredly, that by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence ye shall die, in the place whither ye have chosen to go and to sojourn.”
024	JER	043	001	And it came to pass, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking to all the people all the words of Jehovah their God, for which Jehovah their God had sent him to them, even all these words,
024	JER	043	002	then spake Azariah, the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan, the son of Kareah, and all the proud men, saying to Jeremiah, “Thou speakest falsely; Jehovah our God hath not sent thee to say, Go not into Egypt to sojourn there;
024	JER	043	003	but Baruch, the son of Neriah, setteth thee on against us, to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldaeans, that they may put us to death, and carry us away captive to Babylon.”
024	JER	043	004	So Johanan, the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, and all the people, obeyed not the voice of Jehovah, to remain in the land of Judah.
024	JER	043	005	But Johanan, the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, took all the remnant of Judah, who were returned from all the nations whither they had been driven to dwell in the land of Judah,
024	JER	043	006	the men, and the women, and the children, and the king's daughters, and every person whom Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, had left with Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch, the son of Neriah;
024	JER	043	007	and they went into the land of Egypt; for they obeyed not the voice of Jehovah; and they came to Tahpanhes.
024	JER	043	008	Then came the word of Jehovah to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying:
024	JER	043	009	Take in thy hand great stones, and hide them in the clay in the brick-kiln which is at the entrance of the house of Pharaoh in Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah,
024	JER	043	010	and say to them: Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will send, and take Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, my servant, and I will set his throne upon these stones which I have hidden, and he shall spread his royal canopy over them.
024	JER	043	011	And he shall come and smite the land of Egypt, and deliver those that are for death to death, and those that are for captivity to captivity, and those that are for the sword to the sword.
024	JER	043	012	And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt; and he shall burn them, and carry them away captive; and he shall wrap himself in the land of Egypt, as a shepherd wrappeth himself in his garment, and he shall go forth from thence in peace.
024	JER	043	013	And he shall break in pieces the images of Bethshemesh in the land of Egypt; and the houses of the gods of Egypt shall he burn with fire.
024	JER	044	001	The word which came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews that dwelt in the land of Egypt, that dwelt at Migdol, and at Tahpanhes, and at Noph, and in the land of Pathros, saying:
024	JER	044	002	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Ye have seen all the evil which I have brought upon Jerusalem, and upon all the cities of Judah; and behold, this day they are a desolation, and no man dwelleth therein;
024	JER	044	003	because of their wickedness, which they have committed, to provoke me to anger, in that they went to burn incense and to serve strange gods, whom they knew not, neither they, ye, nor your fathers;
024	JER	044	004	and I sent to you all my servants, the prophets, rising early and sending them, saying: O do not this abominable thing, which I hate!
024	JER	044	005	But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness, to burn no incense to strange gods.
024	JER	044	006	Therefore hath my fury been poured forth, and mine anger, and hath burned in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they are become a desolation and a waste at this day.
024	JER	044	007	And now thus saith Jehovah, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: Wherefore do ye commit this great evil against your own souls, that ye may cut off from you man and woman, child and suckling, out of Judah, so as to leave yourselves no remnant?
024	JER	044	008	Why do ye provoke me to wrath with the works of your hands, burning incense to strange gods in the land of Egypt, whither ye are gone to dwell, so that ye may cut yourselves off, and that ye may be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth?
024	JER	044	009	Have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, which they have committed in the land of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem?
024	JER	044	010	They have not been humbled even to this day, neither have they feared, nor walked in my law, nor in my statutes, which I set before you, and before your fathers.
024	JER	044	011	Therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I set my face against you for evil, even to cut off all Judah.
024	JER	044	012	And I will take the remnant of Judah, that have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they shall all be consumed; in the land of Egypt shall they fall; by the sword and by famine shall they be consumed, from the least to the greatest; by the sword and by famine shall they die; and they shall become an execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach.
024	JER	044	013	For I will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence.
024	JER	044	014	And none shall escape or remain of the remnant of Judah which are gone into the land of Egypt, to sojourn there, and to return into the land of Judah, to which they have a desire to return, to dwell there; for none shall return but a few fugitives that escape.
024	JER	044	015	Then all the men who knew that their wives had burned incense to strange gods, and all the women that stood by, a great multitude, even all the people that dwelt in the land of Egypt, and in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying:
024	JER	044	016	“As for the word which thou hast spoken to us in the name of Jehovah, we will not hearken to thee,
024	JER	044	017	But whatever hath gone forth from our mouth, that will we do, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings to her, as we have done, we and our fathers, our kings and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem; for then we had plenty of bread, and were prosperous, and saw no calamity.
024	JER	044	018	But from the time we left off to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings to her, we have been in want of all things, and have been consumed by the sword and by famine.
024	JER	044	019	And when we [[said the women]] burned incense to the queen of heaven, and poured out drink-offerings to her, did we without the knowledge of our men make cakes to worship her, and pour out drink-offerings to her?”
024	JER	044	020	Then spake Jeremiah to all the people, to the men, and to the women, and to all the people who had given him that answer, saying:
024	JER	044	021	“The incense which ye burned in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, ye and your fathers, your kings and your princes, and the people of the land, did not Jehovah remember it, and came it not into his mind?
024	JER	044	022	And Jehovah could no longer bear the evil of your doings, and the abominations which ye committed; therefore is your land a desolation, and an astonishment, and a curse, without an inhabitant at this day.
024	JER	044	023	Because ye have burned incense, and because ye have sinned against Jehovah, and have not obeyed the voice of Jehovah, nor walked in his law, nor in his statutes, nor in his ordinances, therefore is this evil come upon you, at this day.”
024	JER	044	024	And Jeremiah said to all the people and to all the women, Hear the word of Jehovah, all Judah, that are in the land of Egypt!
024	JER	044	025	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Ye and your wives speak with your mouths, and fulfill with your hands; ye say, “We will keep our vows, which we have vowed, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings to her”; ye will surely accomplish your vows; ye will surely perform your vows.
024	JER	044	026	Therefore hear ye the word of Jehovah, all ye of Judah, that dwell in the land of Egypt! Behold, I swear by my great name, saith Jehovah, that my name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, “As the Lord Jehovah liveth!”
024	JER	044	027	Behold, I will watch over them for evil, and not for good; and all the men of Judah who are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by famine, until there be an end of them.
024	JER	044	028	And they that escape the sword shall return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Judah, few in number; and all the remnant of Judah, that are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall know whose words shall stand, mine or theirs.
024	JER	044	029	And this shall be a sign to you, saith Jehovah, that I will punish you in this place, that ye may know that my words shall surely stand against you for evil.
024	JER	044	030	Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will give Pharaoh Hophra, the king of Egypt, into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of them that seek his life, as I gave Zedekiah, the king of Judah, into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, his enemy, that sought his life.”
024	JER	045	001	The word which Jeremiah the prophet spake to Baruch, the son of Neriah, after he had written these words in a book from the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, the king of Judah, saying: —
024	JER	045	002	Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, to thee, O Baruch!
024	JER	045	003	Thou sayest, “Woe now to me, for Jehovah hath added grief to my sorrow! I am weary with my sighing, and find no rest.”
024	JER	045	004	Thus shalt thou say to him: Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, that which I myself have builded do I break down, and that which I myself have planted do I pluck up, even this whole land;
024	JER	045	005	and seekest thou great things for thyself? Seek them not; for behold, I am about to bring evil upon all flesh, saith Jehovah; but thy life will I give thee, as a prey, in all places whither thou shalt go.
024	JER	046	001	The word which came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the nations.
024	JER	046	002	Of Egypt. Concerning the army of Pharaoh-Necho, the king of Egypt, which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish, which Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, smote, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, king of Judah.
024	JER	046	003	Prepare ye the buckler and shield, And move on to battle!
024	JER	046	004	Harness the horses, and mount, ye riders! Stand forth in your helmets; Make bright the spears, And put on the coats of mail!
024	JER	046	005	Wherefore do I see them dismayed, and turned back? Even their mighty ones are smitten; They flee apace; they look not back. Terror is on every side, saith Jehovah.
024	JER	046	006	Let not the swift attempt to flee away, Nor the mighty man to escape; Toward the North by the river Euphrates shall they stumble and fall.
024	JER	046	007	Who is he that riseth up like the Nile, Whose waters swell like floods?
024	JER	046	008	Egypt riseth up like the Nile, And like floods do his waters swell. He saith, “I will arise, I will cover the land, I will destroy the city, and them that dwell therein.”
024	JER	046	009	Come up, ye horses, and rage, ye chariots! And let the mighty men go forth, The Ethiopians, and the Libyans, that bear the shield, And the Lydians, that bear and bend the bow!
024	JER	046	010	This is the day of the Lord Jehovah of hosts, A day of vengeance, to avenge himself of his enemies; And the sword shall devour, and satiate itself, And it shall be made drunk with their blood. For Jehovah of hosts hath a sacrifice In the North country, by the river Euphrates.
024	JER	046	011	Go up to Gilead, and take balm, O virgin, daughter of Egypt! In vain shalt thou use many medicines; There is no cure for thee!
024	JER	046	012	The nations have heard of thy shame, And thy cry hath filled the earth; For they have stumbled, the mighty against the mighty, And they are fallen both together.
024	JER	046	013	The word which Jehovah spake to Jeremiah the prophet, concerning the coming of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, to smite the land of Egypt.
024	JER	046	014	Declare ye in Egypt, and proclaim in Migdol, Proclaim ye also in Noph and Tahpanhes! Say ye, “Stand fast and prepare thyself, For the sword shall devour round about thee!”
024	JER	046	015	Wherefore are thy mighty ones overthrown? They stood not, because Jehovah cast them down.
024	JER	046	016	He caused many to fall; one fell upon another; And they said, “Arise, and let us go to our own people, And to the land of our nativity, from the overpowering sword.”
024	JER	046	017	There they cry, “Pharaoh, king of Egypt, is undone! He hath let pass the appointed time.”
024	JER	046	018	As I live, saith the King, Whose name is Jehovah of hosts: Like Tabor among the mountains, And like Carmel by the sea, he cometh! Prepare thyself travelling equipage,
024	JER	046	019	Thou who dwellest in Egypt! For Noph shall become waste, Yea, desolate without an inhabitant.
024	JER	046	020	Egypt is a fair heifer, But destruction cometh; it cometh from the North.
024	JER	046	021	Her mercenaries also in the midst of her are like fatted bullocks; Yet they also turn back; they flee together; they stand not; For the day of their calamity is come upon them, And the time of their punishment.
024	JER	046	022	Her voice shall be heard like that of a serpent, When they shall march against her with their forces, And come against her with axes like fellers of trees.
024	JER	046	023	They shall cut down her forest, though it be impenetrable; For they exceed the locusts in multitude, And are innumerable.
024	JER	046	024	The daughter of Egypt is brought to shame; She is given into the hand of the people of the North.
024	JER	046	025	Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, saith: Behold, I will punish Ammon of No, And Pharaoh, and Egypt, with their gods and their kings; Even Pharaoh and all that trust in him.
024	JER	046	026	And I will deliver them into the hands of those that seek their lives, And into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, And into the hand of his servants. But after this it shall be inhabited, As in the days of old, saith Jehovah.
024	JER	046	027	But fear thou not, O my servant Jacob, And be not thou dismayed, O Israel! For, behold, I will bring thee safe from afar, And thy posterity from the land of their captivity; And Jacob shall return and be at rest, Yea, he shall be quiet, and none shall make him afraid.
024	JER	046	028	Fear thou not, O Jacob, my servant, saith Jehovah, For I will be with thee; When I shall make a full end of all the nations Whither I have dispersed thee, Yet will I not make a full end of thee; I will correct thee in measure; Yet must I not leave thee wholly unpunished.
024	JER	047	001	The word of Jehovah which came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the Philistines, before Pharaoh had smitten Gaza.
024	JER	047	002	Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, waters rise up out of the North, And they shall become an overflowing torrent, And shall overflow the land, and all that is therein, —The city, and them that dwell therein; And the men shall cry aloud, And all the inhabitants of the land shall wail.
024	JER	047	003	At the noise of the stamping of the horses, At the rattling of his chariots, And at the rumbling of his wheels, Fathers look not back for their children, For feebleness of hands,
024	JER	047	004	Because of the day which cometh, To lay waste all the Philistines, To cut off from Tyre and from Sidon Every helper that remaineth. For Jehovah will lay waste the Philistines, The remnant of the country of Caphtor.
024	JER	047	005	Baldness is come upon Gaza, Askelon is in ruins, And the remnant of their valley! How long wilt thou cut thyself?
024	JER	047	006	Ah! sword of Jehovah, How long ere thou wilt be quiet? Retire into thy scabbard, Rest, and be still!
024	JER	047	007	But how canst thou be at rest, Since Jehovah hath given thee a charge against Askelon, And against the coast of the sea? There hath he appointed it.
024	JER	048	001	Concerning Moab. Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Woe to Nebo, for it is laid waste! Kiriathaim is confounded, is taken. Misgab is confounded and dismayed.
024	JER	048	002	Moab shall no more glory in Heshbon; They have devised evil against her; “Come, [[say they, ]] and let us cut her off from being a nation!” Thou also shalt be cut down, O Madmena, The sword shall pursue thee!
024	JER	048	003	A cry is heard from Horonaim, Desolation and great destruction.
024	JER	048	004	Moab is destroyed; Her little ones raise a cry.
024	JER	048	005	At the ascent of Luhith Weeping goeth up after weeping; At the descent of Horonaim is heard a bitter cry of despair.
024	JER	048	006	Flee ye! save your lives! Be ye like one that has been stripped in the wilderness!
024	JER	048	007	For, because thou hast trusted in thy substance and thy treasures, Thou also shalt be taken And Chemosh shall go into captivity, His priests and his princes together.
024	JER	048	008	The spoiler shall come upon every city, And no city shall escape. The valley shall perish, And the plain shall be destroyed, As Jehovah hath spoken.
024	JER	048	009	Give wings to Moab, That she may flee away; For her cities shall be a desolation, With none to dwell therein.
024	JER	048	010	Cursed be he that doeth the work of Jehovah deceitfully, And cursed be he that keepeth back his sword from blood!
024	JER	048	011	Moab hath been at ease from his youth, And he hath settled on his lees, And hath not been drawn off from vessel to vessel, Neither hath he gone into captivity; Therefore his taste hath remained in him, And his flavor hath not changed.
024	JER	048	012	Therefore, behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, That I will send to him tilters, who shall tilt him up, And shall empty his vessels, and break his pitchers in pieces.
024	JER	048	013	And Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh, As the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel, their confidence.
024	JER	048	014	How will ye say, “We are mighty, And strong men for war”?
024	JER	048	015	Moab is destroyed; His cities have gone up in smoke, And his chosen young men have gone down to slaughter, Saith the King whose name is Jehovah of hosts.
024	JER	048	016	The destruction of Moab is near at hand; His destruction hasteth fast.
024	JER	048	017	All ye that are about him, bemoan him! And all ye that know him, say, “How is the strong sceptre broken, The splendid staff!”
024	JER	048	018	Come down from thy glory and sit in thirst, O inhabitant of Dibon! For the destroyer of Moab shall come against thee! He shall destroy thy strongholds. Stand by the wayside, and look out,
024	JER	048	019	O inhabitant of Aroer! Ask of him that fleeth, and of her that escapeth, And say, “What hath been done?”
024	JER	048	020	Moab is confounded; for it is broken down; Howl ye, and cry! Tell ye it in Arnon, That Moab is destroyed!
024	JER	048	021	And punishment hath come upon the plain country; Upon Holon, and upon Jahazah, and upon Mephaath,
024	JER	048	022	And upon Dibon, and upon Nebo, and upon Beth-diblathaim.
024	JER	048	023	And upon Kiriathaim, and upon Beth-gamul, and upon Beth-meon,
024	JER	048	024	And upon Kerioth, and upon Bozrah, And upon all the cities of the land of Moab far and near.
024	JER	048	025	The horn of Moab is cut off, And his arm is broken, saith Jehovah.
024	JER	048	026	Make ye him drunken, for he hath exalted himself against Jehovah; That he also may wallow in his vomit, And be himself also in derision.
024	JER	048	027	Was not Israel a derision to thee? Was he found among thieves, That, as often as thou spakest of him, thou shouldst shake thy head?
024	JER	048	028	Leave the cities and dwell in the rock, O inhabitants of Moab! Be like the dove, that maketh her nest in the sides of the mouth of the pit!
024	JER	048	029	We have heard of the pride of Moab; He hath been exceeding proud; His loftiness and his arrogance, His pride and the haughtiness of his heart.
024	JER	048	030	I, too, know his insolence, saith Jehovah, And his vain boastings. They shall effect nothing.
024	JER	048	031	Therefore will I wail for Moab, Even for all Moab will I cry out; For the men of Kir-heres shall there be mourning.
024	JER	048	032	More than Jazer will I weep for thee, O vine of Sibmah! Thy branches have passed beyond the sea; They reach even to the sea of Jazer; Upon thy summer-fruits and thy vintage the spoiler falleth.
024	JER	048	033	And joy and gladness are taken away from the fruitful field; And from the land of Moab, And from the presses, have I caused the wine to fail: No more shall they tread with shouting; The shouting shall be no shouting.
024	JER	048	034	From wailing Heshbon to Elealeh, Even to Jahaz, is their voice heard, From Zoar even to Horonaim, To Eglath-shelishijah; For even the waters of Nimrim are desolate.
024	JER	048	035	And I will cause to cease in Moab, saith Jehovah, Him that offereth in the high places, And him that burneth incense to his gods.
024	JER	048	036	Therefore doth my heart sound like a flute for Moab, And for the men of Ker-heres doth my heart sound like a flute; For the remnant of their substance is perished.
024	JER	048	037	Every head is bald, And every beard shorn; Upon all hands are cutting, And upon the loins sackcloth.
024	JER	048	038	Upon all the house-tops of Moab, and in her streets, All is lamentation. For I have broken Moab, like a useless vessel, saith Jehovah.
024	JER	048	039	Howl ye! How is he broken down! How hath Moab turned the back with shame! A derision and a consternation is Moab To all that are round him.
024	JER	048	040	For thus saith Jehovah: Behold, like an eagle flieth an enemy, And spreadeth his wings over Moab.
024	JER	048	041	Kerioth is taken, And the strongholds are seized; The hearts of the heroes of Moab in that day Shall be like the heart of a woman in her pangs.
024	JER	048	042	And Moab shall be destroyed so as to be no more a people, Because he exalted himself against Jehovah.
024	JER	048	043	Terror and the pit and the snare are upon thee, O inhabitant of Moab, saith Jehovah.
024	JER	048	044	He that fleeth from the terror shall fall into the pit, And he that getteth up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare; For I will bring upon it, upon Moab, The year of their punishment, saith Jehovah.
024	JER	048	045	In the valley of Heshbon the fugitives halted for want of strength; But a fire is gone forth from Heshbon, And a flame from the midst of Sihon, Which devoureth the region of Moab, And the heads of the sons of tumult.
024	JER	048	046	Woe to thee, O Moab! Undone is the people of Chemosh! For thy sons are taken captives, And thy daughters are captives.
024	JER	048	047	Yet will I bring back the captivity of Moab In future times, saith Jehovah. Thus far the judgment of Moab.
024	JER	049	001	Concerning the children of Ammon. Thus saith Jehovah: Hath Israel no sons? Hath he not an heir? Why then doth Milcom inherit Gad, And his people dwell in his cities?
024	JER	049	002	Therefore, behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, That I will cause a cry of war to be heard against Rabbah of the sons of Ammon, And she shall become a ruinous heap, And her daughters shall be burned with fire; And Israel shall take possession of their land, who took possession of his.
024	JER	049	003	Howl, O Heshbon, for Ai is laid waste! Cry, ye daughters of Rabbah, Gird yourselves with sackcloth, lament, And run ye to and fro within the fences! For Milcom goeth into captivity, His priests and his princes together.
024	JER	049	004	Wherefore dost thou glory in the valleys? Thy valley shall flow [[with blood]], O perverse daughter, That gloriest in thy treasures, [[Saying, ]] “Who shall come against me?”
024	JER	049	005	Behold, I will bring a terror upon thee, saith Jehovah of hosts, From all those that are around thee, And ye shall be driven out, every one right forth, And there shall be none to gather up the fugitives.
024	JER	049	006	But after this will I bring back the captivity of the sons of Ammon, saith Jehovah.
024	JER	049	007	Concerning the Edomites. Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Is wisdom no more in Teman? Is counsel passed away from the prudent? Is their wisdom vanished?
024	JER	049	008	Flee ye, turn ye back, Dwell in deep places, O ye inhabitants of Dedan! For the destruction of Esau do I bring, The time of his punishment upon him.
024	JER	049	009	If grape-gatherers had come upon thee, Would they not have left some gleanings? If thieves by night, They would have destroyed only till they had enough.
024	JER	049	010	But I will make Esau bare; I will uncover his hiding-places, So that he shall not be able to hide himself. His offspring shall be destroyed, and his brethren, and his neighbors, And he shall be no more.
024	JER	049	011	Leave thy fatherless children, I will preserve them alive, And thy widows, let them trust in me!
024	JER	049	012	For thus saith Jehovah: Behold, they who ought not to have drunk the cup have deeply drunken, And shalt thou go altogether unpunished? Thou shalt not go unpunished; Thou shalt surely drink.
024	JER	049	013	For by myself have I sworn, saith Jehovah, That Bozrah shall become an astonishment, A reproach, a desolation, and a curse; And all her cities shall be perpetual wastes.
024	JER	049	014	I have heard a proclamation from Jehovah, And an ambassador hath been sent among the nations, [[Saying, ]] “Assemble yourselves, and come against her, And arise to battle!”
024	JER	049	015	For, behold, I will make thee small among the nations, Despised among men.
024	JER	049	016	Thy terribleness hath deceived thee, The pride of thy heart, Because thou dwellest in the recesses of the rock, And holdest the height of the hill. Though thou set thy nest on high, like the eagle, From thence will I bring thee down, saith Jehovah.
024	JER	049	017	And Edom shall be an astonishment: Every one that passeth by her shall be astonished, And shall hiss on account of all her plagues.
024	JER	049	018	As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, And their neighboring cities, saith Jehovah, There shall not a man abide there, Nor a son of man dwell within her.
024	JER	049	019	Behold, he [[the enemy]] cometh up like a lion from the pride of Jordan against the habitation of the rock; Suddenly will I drive him [[Edom]] thence, And him who is chosen by me will I set over her. For who is like me, Or who will summon me to trial? Or who is the shepherd that will stand up against me?
024	JER	049	020	Therefore, hear ye the purpose of Jehovah, Which he hath formed against Edom, And the designs which he meditateth against the inhabitants of Teman! Surely he [[the enemy]] shall drag them forth like feeble sheep; Surely he shall come upon them, And make their pastures desolate.
024	JER	049	021	At the noise of their fall the earth trembleth, Even to the Red Sea is their cry heard.
024	JER	049	022	Behold, like an eagle, he [[the enemy]] cometh up, And spreadeth his wings over Bozrah; And the hearts of the heroes of Edom, in that day, Shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.
024	JER	049	023	Concerning Damascus. Hamath and Arpad are confounded; They faint, because they have heard evil tidings. There is anxiety at the sea; It cannot be at rest.
024	JER	049	024	Damascus is faint-hearted; She turneth herself to flee; Trembling hath seized on her; Anguish and pangs have taken hold of her, as of a woman in travail.
024	JER	049	025	“Why is not the praised city left, The city of my joy?”
024	JER	049	026	Yea, her young men shall fall in her streets, And all her men of war shall be cut off in that day, Saith Jehovah of hosts.
024	JER	049	027	Yea, I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, Which shall consume the palaces of Benhadad.
024	JER	049	028	Concerning Kedar, and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, smote. Thus saith Jehovah: Arise ye, go up against Kedar, And spoil the sons of the East!
024	JER	049	029	Their tents and their flocks shall they take away; They shall take to themselves their curtains, and all their furniture, and their camels, And men shall cry to them, “Terror is on every side.”
024	JER	049	030	Flee, get you far off, dwell in deep places, O ye inhabitants of Hazor, saith Jehovah. For Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, meditates a design against you, And has formed a purpose against you.
024	JER	049	031	Arise ye, go up against a nation at ease, That dwelleth securely, saith Jehovah; Which hath neither gates nor bars; Which dwelleth alone.
024	JER	049	032	And their camels shall be a booty, And the multitude of their cattle a spoil; And I will scatter to all the winds them that shave the cheeks, And from every side will I bring their calamity, saith Jehovah.
024	JER	049	033	And Hazor shall be a dwelling for jackals, A desolation forever. There shall not a man abide there, Nor any son of man dwell therein.
024	JER	049	034	The word of Jehovah which came to Jeremiah the prophet against Elam, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah, king of Judah, saying: —
024	JER	049	035	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Behold, I break the bow of Elam, The chief part of their strength.
024	JER	049	036	And I will bring against Elam The four winds from the four extremities of the heavens, And I will scatter them to all these winds, And there shall be no nation To which the outcasts of Elam shall not come.
024	JER	049	037	For I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, And before them that seek their life. And I will bring evil upon them, The fierceness of my anger, saith Jehovah. And I will send after them the sword, Until I have consumed them.
024	JER	049	038	And I will set up my throne in Elam, And I will destroy from thence king and princes, saith Jehovah.
024	JER	049	039	But it shall come to pass in future times, That I will bring back the captivity of Elam, saith Jehovah.
024	JER	050	001	The word which Jehovah spake concerning Babylon, and concerning the land of the Chaldaeans, by Jeremiah the prophet.
024	JER	050	002	Tell ye among the nations, and proclaim, and lift up a standard! Proclaim ye; conceal it not; Say ye, “Babylon is taken, Bel is confounded, Merodach is in consternation, Her idols are confounded, Her images are in consternation.”
024	JER	050	003	For out of the North cometh up against her a nation Which shall make her land desolate, So that none shall dwell therein; Both man and beast are fled, They are gone.
024	JER	050	004	In those days, and at that time, saith Jehovah, The children of Israel shall come, They and the children of Judah together; They shall go weeping on their way, And shall seek Jehovah their God.
024	JER	050	005	They shall ask the way to Zion, with their faces thitherward; They shall come, and shall join themselves to Jehovah In a perpetual covenant, that shall not be forgotten.
024	JER	050	006	My people have been lost sheep; Their shepherds have caused them to go astray; They have caused them to wander upon the mountains; They have gone from mountain to hill, They have forgotten their fold.
024	JER	050	007	All that found them devoured them; For their adversaries said, “We shall not be held guilty,” Because they had sinned against Jehovah, The fold of safety, and the hope of their fathers, Jehovah.
024	JER	050	008	Flee ye out of Babylon, And go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans, And be ye like he-goats before the flock!
024	JER	050	009	For, behold, I will raise up and bring against Babylon An assembly of great nations from the land of the North, And they shall set themselves in array against her, And then shall she be taken; Their arrows shall be as those of an expert warrior; None shall return in vain.
024	JER	050	010	And Chaldaea shall be a spoil; All that spoil her shall have their fill, saith Jehovah.
024	JER	050	011	Because ye rejoiced and exulted, O ye plunderers of my inheritance, Because ye wantoned like a thrashing heifer, And neighed like a stallion,
024	JER	050	012	Your mother is utterly confounded; She that bore you is put to shame. Behold, the end of the nations, A wilderness, a dry land, a desert!
024	JER	050	013	Because of the wrath of Jehovah, she shall not be inhabited, She shall be wholly desolate; Every one that passeth by Babylon shall be amazed, And hiss on account of all her plagues.
024	JER	050	014	Put yourselves in array against Babylon round about: All ye that bend the bow, shoot at her; Spare not the arrows! For she hath sinned against Jehovah.
024	JER	050	015	Raise the war-shout! She reacheth forth her hand; Her pillars are fallen; Her walls are thrown down; For it is the vengeance of Jehovah. Take ye vengeance upon her! As she hath done, do ye to her!
024	JER	050	016	Cut ye off the sower from Babylon, And him that handleth the sickle in harvest-time! Because of the overpowering sword They shall turn every one to his own people, And they shall flee every one to his own land.
024	JER	050	017	Israel hath been like scattered sheep, Which the lions have driven away; First the king of Assyria devoured him, And last, this Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, hath broken his bones.
024	JER	050	018	Therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will punish the king of Babylon and his land, As I have punished the king of Assyria.
024	JER	050	019	And I will bring back Israel to his own pasture, And he shall feed upon Carmel and Bashan, And satiate himself upon mount Ephraim and Gilead.
024	JER	050	020	In those days and at that time, saith Jehovah, The iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none; And the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found; For I will pardon those whom I cause to be left.
024	JER	050	021	Against the land of Rebellion go ye up, And against the inhabitants of Vengeance! Lay waste and utterly destroy after them, saith Jehovah, And do all which I have commanded thee!
024	JER	050	022	The din of battle is in the land, And great destruction.
024	JER	050	023	How is the battle-hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken! How is Babylon become an astonishment to all the nations!
024	JER	050	024	I have laid a snare for thee, And thou hast been caught, O Babylon, When thou wast not aware! Thou hast been found and taken, Because thou hast contended against Jehovah.
024	JER	050	025	Jehovah hath opened his armory, And hath brought out the weapons of his indignation; For the Lord Jehovah of hosts performeth a work against the land of the Chaldaeans.
024	JER	050	026	Come against her from the utmost border! Open ye her barns, Cast her up into heaps, And destroy her utterly; Let nothing of her be left!
024	JER	050	027	Slay all her bullocks, Let them go down to the slaughter! Woe unto them, For their day is come, The time of their punishment!
024	JER	050	028	The voice of them that flee and escape is heard from the land of Babylon, To make known to Zion the vengeance of Jehovah, our God, The vengeance for his temple.
024	JER	050	029	Call together the archers against Babylon, All ye that bend the bow, encamp ye round about her; Let no one escape; Recompense her according to her work; According to all that she hath done, do ye to her! For she hath exalted herself against Jehovah, Against the Holy One of Israel.
024	JER	050	030	Therefore shall her young men fall in the streets, And all her men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith Jehovah.
024	JER	050	031	Behold I am against thee, thou proud one, saith the Lord Jehovah of hosts; For thy day is come, The time of thy punishment.
024	JER	050	032	And the proud one shall stumble and fall, And none shall raise him up; And I will kindle a fire in his cities, And it shall devour all round about him.
024	JER	050	033	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: The children of Israel and the children of Judah are oppressed together, And all that took them captives hold them fast; They refuse to let them go.
024	JER	050	034	But their redeemer is strong; Jehovah of hosts is his name. He will maintain their cause, So as to give rest to the land, And confusion to the inhabitants of Babylon.
024	JER	050	035	The sword shall be upon the Chaldaeans, saith Jehovah, And upon the inhabitants of Babylon; And upon her princes, And upon her wise men;
024	JER	050	036	The sword upon her lying prophets, and they shall be fools; The sword upon her heroes, and they shall be dismayed;
024	JER	050	037	The sword upon her horses, and upon her chariots, And against all the allied multitude that is within her, And they shall become women. The sword is upon their treasures, and they shall be plundered;
024	JER	050	038	A drought is upon her waters, and they shall be dried up; For it is a land of graven images, And they put a mad trust in idols.
024	JER	050	039	Therefore the wild beasts of the desert, with the jackals, shall dwell there, And therein shall the ostrich dwell. And it shall be no more inhabited forever, Neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation.
024	JER	050	040	As it was when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and the neighboring cities, saith Jehovah, There shall not a man abide there, Nor any son of man dwell therein.
024	JER	050	041	Behold, a nation cometh from the North, And a great people and many kings shall rise up from the extremities of the earth.
024	JER	050	042	They bear the bow and the javelin; They are cruel, and show no mercy; Their voice roareth like the sea, And they ride upon horses, arrayed like a warrior, Against thee, O daughter of Babylon!
024	JER	050	043	The king of Babylon heareth the rumor concerning them, And his hands become feeble; Anguish taketh hold of him, Trembling, as of a woman in travail.
024	JER	050	044	Behold, like a lion from the pride of Jordan, he cometh up against the habitation of the rock; Suddenly will I drive them from her; And him who is chosen by me will I appoint over her; For who is like me? And who will summon me to trial? And who is the shepherd that will stand up against me?
024	JER	050	045	Therefore hear ye the purpose of Jehovah, which he hath formed against Babylon, And the designs which he meditateth against the land of the Chaldaeans; Surely he [[the enemy]] shall drag them forth like feeble sheep, Surely he will come upon them, and make their pastures desolate.
024	JER	050	046	At the noise of the taking of Babylon, the earth trembleth, And the cry is heard among the nations.
024	JER	051	001	Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will raise up against Babylon, And against them that dwell in the midst of mine adversaries, A destroying wind;
024	JER	051	002	And I will send against Babylon winnowers, And they shall winnow her, and empty her land; For they shall come against her on every side.
024	JER	051	003	Against him that bendeth, let the archer bend his bow, And against him that lifteth himself up in his brigandine! And spare ye not her young men; Destroy ye utterly her whole host!
024	JER	051	004	Thus shall they fall down slain in the land of the Chaldaeans, And thrust through in her streets.
024	JER	051	005	For Israel is not forsaken, nor Judah abandoned of his God, of Jehovah of hosts; For their land is full of guilt against the Holy One of Israel.
024	JER	051	006	Flee ye out of Babylon, And save ye every man his life, That ye be not cut off in her punishment! For this is the time of Jehovah's vengeance; He will render to her a recompense.
024	JER	051	007	Babylon has been a golden cup in the hand of Jehovah, That made all the earth drunken; The nations have drunken of her wine, Therefore the nations are mad.
024	JER	051	008	Babylon is suddenly fallen, and broken; Howl ye over her; Bring ye balm for her wounds, If so be she may be healed.
024	JER	051	009	“We would have healed Babylon, But she cannot be healed. Forsake her, and let us go every one to his own country! For her punishment reacheth to the heavens, And ascendeth even to the skies.”
024	JER	051	010	Jehovah hath brought forth our deliverance; Come ye, and let us declare in Zion The work of Jehovah our God.
024	JER	051	011	Make sharp the arrows; put on the shields! Jehovah hath roused up the spirit of the kings of the Medes; For his purpose is against Babylon, to destroy it; For this is the vengeance of Jehovah, The vengeance for his temple.
024	JER	051	012	Against the walls of Babylon set up a standard, Make strong the guard, appoint the watchmen, prepare the ambush! For Jehovah deviseth and doeth that which he spake Against the inhabitants of Babylon.
024	JER	051	013	O thou that dwellest by great waters, That aboundest in treasures, Thine end is come; The measure of thy rapaciousness is full!
024	JER	051	014	Jehovah of hosts hath sworn by himself, [[saying, ]] Surely I will fill thee with men, as with caterpillars, Who shall raise the war-shout against thee.
024	JER	051	015	He made the earth by his power, He established the world by his wisdom, And by his understanding he spread out the heavens.
024	JER	051	016	When he uttereth his voice there is an abundance of water in the heavens; He causeth clouds to ascend from the ends of the earth; He bringeth the wind from his storehouses.
024	JER	051	017	Brutish is every man who hath not this knowledge; By his images is every founder put to shame; For his molten work is deceit; There is no breath in it.
024	JER	051	018	They are vanity, deceptive work; In the time of their punishment shall they perish.
024	JER	051	019	Not like them is he who is the portion of Jacob; He is the former of all things, And Israel is his allotted inheritance. Jehovah of hosts is his name.
024	JER	051	020	Thou hast been to me my battle-hammer, My weapon of war. And with thee I broke in pieces the nations, And with thee I destroyed the kingdoms.
024	JER	051	021	And with thee I broke in pieces the horse and his rider, And with thee I broke in pieces the chariot and its driver.
024	JER	051	022	With thee I broke in pieces man and woman, And with thee I broke in pieces the old and the young, And with thee I broke in pieces the young man and the maiden.
024	JER	051	023	With thee I broke in pieces the shepherd and his flock, And with thee I broke in pieces the husbandman and his team; And with thee I broke in pieces prefects and governors.
024	JER	051	024	But now before your eyes will I repay to Babylon, And to all the inhabitants of Chaldaea, All the evil which they have done in Zion, saith Jehovah.
024	JER	051	025	O thou destroying mountain, that destroyest the whole earth, Behold, I am against thee, saith Jehovah! And I will stretch out my hand against thee, And roll thee down from the rocks, And make thee a burnt mountain,
024	JER	051	026	So that none shall take from thee a corner-stone, or a foundation-stone; But thou shalt be a perpetual desolation, saith Jehovah.
024	JER	051	027	Set ye up a standard in the land, Sound a trumpet among the nations; Enlist the nations against Babylon, Call together against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashchenaz; Appoint captains against her, Cause the horses to come up like the bristled locusts!
024	JER	051	028	Enlist ye against her the nations, The kings of the Medes, and their prefects, And all their governors, And all the lands under their dominion,
024	JER	051	029	So that the earth shall tremble and quake! For the purpose of Jehovah against Babylon is to be fulfilled, To make the land of Babylon a desolation, without an inhabitant.
024	JER	051	030	The mighty men of Babylon refuse to fight; They remain in their stronghold; Their strength hath failed; They have become women; Her habitations are burned; Her bars are broken.
024	JER	051	031	Courier runs to meet courier, And messenger to meet messenger, To make known to the king of Babylon, That his city is taken from end to end;
024	JER	051	032	That the passages are taken, That the reeds are burned with fire, And that the men of war are struck with terror.
024	JER	051	033	For thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: The daughter of Babylon shall be like a thrashing-floor when it is thrashed; Yet a little while, and the time of harvest for her shall come.
024	JER	051	034	Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, hath devoured us; He hath made an end of us; He hath made us empty vessels; He hath swallowed us up like a dragon; He hath filled his maw with our delicacies; He hath cast us out.
024	JER	051	035	“The violence done to me and to my flesh be upon Babylon!” Shall the inhabitant of Zion say; And, “My blood be upon the inhabitants of Chaldaeans!” shall Jerusalem say.
024	JER	051	036	Therefore, thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will maintain thy cause, And take vengeance for thee; And I will dry up her sea, And make her springs dry.
024	JER	051	037	And Babylon shall become heaps, The dwelling-place of jackals, An astonishment and a hissing, Without an inhabitant.
024	JER	051	038	Together shall they roar like lions; They shall yell like lions' whelps.
024	JER	051	039	In their heat I will prepare them a drink, And will make them drunk, so that they shall rejoice, And then sleep an everlasting sleep, And awake no more, saith Jehovah.
024	JER	051	040	I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, Like rams with he-goats.
024	JER	051	041	How is Sheshach taken! How is the praise of the whole earth fallen! How is Babylon become an astonishment among the nations!
024	JER	051	042	The sea is come up over Babylon; With the roaring of its waves is she covered.
024	JER	051	043	Her cities have become a desolation, A dry land and a desert, A land in which no man dwelleth, And which no son of man passeth through.
024	JER	051	044	I will punish Bel at Babylon, And bring forth from his mouth that which he hath swallowed, And the nations shall flow to him no more; Even the wall of Babylon shall fall.
024	JER	051	045	Go ye out of her, my people, And save ye every man his life From the fierce anger of Jehovah!
024	JER	051	046	And let not your heart faint, And fear ye not on account of the rumors which are heard in the land, When in one year a rumor cometh, And after it in another year another rumor, And violence is in the land, Ruler against ruler.
024	JER	051	047	Therefore, behold the days come When I will punish the graven images of Babylon, And her whole land shall be confounded; And all her slain shall fall in the midst of her.
024	JER	051	048	Then the heavens shall shout over Babylon, And the earth and all that is therein; For out of the North come spoilers against her, saith Jehovah.
024	JER	051	049	As Babylon caused the slain of Israel to fall, So at Babylon shall fall the slain of all the land.
024	JER	051	050	Ye that have escaped her sword, go! Tarry not! Remember Jehovah afar off, And let Jerusalem come into your mind!
024	JER	051	051	We have been confounded, because we have heard reproach; Shame hath covered our faces, For strangers have come into the sanctuaries of the house of Jehovah.
024	JER	051	052	Therefore, behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, When I will punish her graven images, And through all her land shall the wounded groan.
024	JER	051	053	Though Babylon should mount up to the heavens, And make inaccessible the height of her strength, Yet from me shall spoilers come upon her, saith Jehovah.
024	JER	051	054	Hark! a cry from Babylon, Of great destruction from the land of the Chaldaeans!
024	JER	051	055	For Jehovah destroyeth Babylon, And bringeth to silence her loud tumult; Their waves roar like great waters; Their tumultuous noise resounds.
024	JER	051	056	For the spoiler is come upon her, upon Babylon; And their mighty men are taken, And all their bows are broken; For Jehovah is a God of retribution; He will surely requite.
024	JER	051	057	And I will make drunk her princes, and her wise men, Her prefects, and her governors, and her mighty men; And they shall sleep an everlasting sleep, And shall no more awake, saith the King, Whose name is Jehovah of hosts.
024	JER	051	058	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: The broad walls of Babylon shall be razed to the foundations, And her high gates shall be burned with fire; So that nations shall have labored for naught, And kingdoms have wearied themselves for fire.
024	JER	051	059	The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah, the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, when he went with Zedekiah, the king of Judah, into Babylon, in the fourth year of his reign. This Seraiah was chief chamberlain.
024	JER	051	060	And Jeremiah wrote all the evil that was to come upon Babylon in one book, all these words that are written concerning Babylon.
024	JER	051	061	And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When thou comest to Babylon, see that thou read all these words,
024	JER	051	062	and say, O Jehovah, thou hast spoken against this place to destroy it, so that none shall remain in it, neither man nor beast, but that it shall remain desolate forever!
024	JER	051	063	And when thou hast made an end of reading this book, bind a stone upon it, and cast it into the midst of the Euphrates,
024	JER	051	064	and say: So shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise again from the evil which I bring upon her. And they shall utterly fail. Thus far the words of Jeremiah.
024	JER	052	001	Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
024	JER	052	002	And he did that which was evil in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.
024	JER	052	003	For, through the anger of Jehovah, it was so with Judah and Jerusalem that at length he cast them forth from his presence. And Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
024	JER	052	004	And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and encamped against it, and built forts against it round about.
024	JER	052	005	And the city was besieged until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah.
024	JER	052	006	And in the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the famine was sore in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land.
024	JER	052	007	And the city was broken into; and all the men of war fled, and went out of the city by night, by the way of the gate between the two walls, which is by the king's garden, (whilst the Chaldaeans were by the city round about, ) and they went toward the plain.
024	JER	052	008	But the army of the Chaldaeans pursued the king, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him.
024	JER	052	009	And they took the king, and carried him up to the king of Babylon, to Riblah, in the land of Hamath; where he gave judgment upon him.
024	JER	052	010	And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes. He slew also all the princes or Judah, in Riblah.
024	JER	052	011	And he put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him in chains; and the king of Babylon carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day of his death.
024	JER	052	012	And in the fifth month, on the tenth day of the month, (it was the nineteenth year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, ) came Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, one that stood in the presence of the king of Babylon, to Jerusalem.
024	JER	052	013	And he burned the house of Jehovah, and the king's house; and all the houses at Jerusalem, all the great houses, burned he with fire.
024	JER	052	014	And all the army of the Chaldaeans that was with the captain of the guard brake down all the walls of Jerusalem round about.
024	JER	052	015	And some of the poor of the people, and the rest of the people that were left in the city, and the deserters that had gone over to the king of Babylon, even the remainder of the multitude, did Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, carry away captive.
024	JER	052	016	But some of the poor of the land did Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, leave for vine-dressers and for husbandmen.
024	JER	052	017	And the pillars of brass that were in the house of Jehovah, and the bases, and the brazen sea that was in the house of Jehovah, the Chaldaeans brake, and carried all the brass of them to Babylon.
024	JER	052	018	The caldrons also, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the bowls, and the pans, and all the vessels of brass which were used in ministering, did they take away.
024	JER	052	019	And the basins, and the fire-pans, and the bowls, and the caldrons, and the candlesticks, and the censers, and the cups, and whatever was of gold or silver, did the captain of the guard take away.
024	JER	052	020	The two pillars, the sea, and the twelve brazen bulls that were under the bases, which King Solomon made in the house of Jehovah, the brass from all these was beyond weight.
024	JER	052	021	For as to the pillars, eighteen cubits in height was the one pillar, and a line of twelve cubits measured it round, and their thickness was four fingers, being hollow.
024	JER	052	022	And a chapiter of brass was upon them; and the height of one chapiter was five cubits; and there was network with pomegranates upon the chapiter all round, the whole of brass. The second pillar also, and the pomegranates, were like unto these.
024	JER	052	023	And the pomegranates were ninety and six toward every wind; all the pomegranates were a hundred upon the network round about.
024	JER	052	024	And the captain of the guard took Seraiah, the chief priest, and Zephaniah, the second priest, and the three keepers of the door;
024	JER	052	025	and out of the city he took a eunuch who had charge over the men of war, and seven men of those that were near the king's person, who were found in the city, and the principal scribe of the host, who mustered the people of the land, and threescore men of the people of the land, who were found in the midst of the city;
024	JER	052	026	these, Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, took, and brought to the king of Babylon at Riblah.
024	JER	052	027	And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death in Riblah in the land of Hamath. Thus was Judah carried away captive out of their own land.
024	JER	052	028	This is the people whom Nebuchadnezzar carried away captive: in the seventh year, three thousand and twenty-three Jews;
024	JER	052	029	in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar, he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred and thirty-two persons;
024	JER	052	030	in the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty and five persons. All the persons were four thousand and six hundred.
024	JER	052	031	And it came to pass in the thirty and seventh year of the captivity of Jehoiachin, the king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-fifth day of the month, that Evil-merodach, the king of Babylon, in the first year of his reign, lifted up the head of Jehoiachin, king of Judah, and brought him forth out of prison,
024	JER	052	032	and spoke kindly to him, and set his seat above the seat of the kings that were with him in Babylon,
024	JER	052	033	and changed his prison garments; and he ate bread before him all the days of his life.
024	JER	052	034	And a constant allowance was given him by the king of Babylon, a portion every day, until the day of his death, all the days of his life.

025	LAM	001	001	How doth the city sit solitary, that was full of people! How is she become as a widow! She that was great among the nations, and princess among the provinces, How is she become tributary!
025	LAM	001	002	She weepeth bitterly in the night; tears are upon her cheeks; Among all her lovers she hath no comforter; All her friends have dealt treacherously with her; they have become her enemies.
025	LAM	001	003	Judah goeth into exile, because of affliction and because of great servitude; She dwelleth among the nations, she findeth no rest; All her pursuers overtake her in the straits.
025	LAM	001	004	The ways to Zion mourn, because none come to the solemn feasts; All her gates are desolate, her priests sigh, Her virgins wail, and she is in bitterness.
025	LAM	001	005	Her adversaries have become the head; her enemies prosper; For Jehovah hath afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions; Her children are gone into captivity before the enemy.
025	LAM	001	006	From the daughter of Zion all her beauty is departed; Her princes are become like harts, that find no pasture; Without strength, they flee before the pursuer.
025	LAM	001	007	Jerusalem remembereth, in the days of her affliction and of her oppression, All her pleasant things, which she had in the days of old, When her people fell into the hand of the enemy, and she had no helper; Her adversaries saw her, and mocked at her destruction.
025	LAM	001	008	Jerusalem hath grievously sinned; therefore is she become vile; All that honored her despise her, because they have seen her shame; She sigheth, and turneth backward.
025	LAM	001	009	Her filthiness is upon her skirts; She thought not of her end, therefore is she brought down wonderfully; she hath no comforter. “Behold, O Jehovah, my affliction, for the enemy doth triumph!”
025	LAM	001	010	The adversary spreadeth his hands over all her pleasant things; Yea, she seeth the nations enter into her sanctuary, Concerning whom thou didst command that they should not enter into her congregation.
025	LAM	001	011	All her people sigh; they seek bread; They give their precious things for bread to sustain life. “Behold, O Jehovah, and consider, how I am become vile!”
025	LAM	001	012	“Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by? Behold, and see, if there be any sorrow like to my sorrow, which is brought upon me, With which Jehovah hath afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger!
025	LAM	001	013	“From on high hath he sent fire into my bones, and it prevailed against them: He hath spread a net for my feet; he hath turned me back; He hath made me desolate, faint all the day long.
025	LAM	001	014	“The yoke of my transgressions is fastened in his hand; they are twisted together; They are laid upon my neck; he hath made my strength to fall; The Lord hath delivered me into their hands, against whom I cannot stand.
025	LAM	001	015	“The Lord hath trodden under foot all my mighty men in the midst of me; He hath called an assembly against me to crush my young men; The Lord hath trodden down the virgin, the daughter of Judah, as in a wine-vat.
025	LAM	001	016	“For these things do I weep; mine eye runneth down with water; For far from me are they that should comfort me, that should restore my strength; My children have perished, because the enemy prevailed.”
025	LAM	001	017	Zion spreadeth forth her hands, and there is none to comfort her; Jehovah hath given command against Jacob, that his adversaries should be round about him; Jerusalem is become an abhorrence among them.
025	LAM	001	018	“Righteous is Jehovah, for I have disobeyed his commandment; Hear, I pray you, all ye nations, and behold my sorrow! My virgins and my young men are gone into captivity.
025	LAM	001	019	“I called upon my lovers, but they have proved false to me; My priests and my elders have expired in the city, While they sought for food to sustain their lives.
025	LAM	001	020	“Behold, O Jehovah, how I am distressed! my bowels boil, My heart turneth itself within me; for I have grievously rebelled. Abroad the sword bereaveth; at home, Death.
025	LAM	001	021	“They hear how I sigh, yet none comforteth me; mine enemies have heard of my calamity; they rejoice that thou hast done it. O bring the day which thou hast appointed, that they shall be like me!
025	LAM	001	022	“Let all their wickedness come before thee, deal thou with them as thou hast dealt with me for all my transgressions! For my sighs are many, and my heart is faint.”
025	LAM	002	001	How hath the Lord in his anger covered with a cloud the daughter of Zion! He hath cast down from heaven to earth the glory of Israel, And hath not remembered his footstool in the day of his anger.
025	LAM	002	002	Lord hath swallowed up without pity all the habitations of Jacob; He hath thrown down in his wrath the strongholds of the daughter of Judah; He hath brought down to the ground, he hath profaned the kingdom and its princes.
025	LAM	002	003	He hath cut off, in his fierce anger, every horn of Israel; He hath drawn back his right hand from the face of the enemy, And hath burned against Jacob like a flaming fire, which devoureth round about.
025	LAM	002	004	He bent his bow like an enemy; He stood with his right hand as an adversary, and slew all that was pleasant to the eye; Upon the tent of the daughter of Zion he poured out his fury like fire.
025	LAM	002	005	The Lord is become as an enemy; he hath swallowed up Israel; He hath swallowed up all his palaces; he hath destroyed his strongholds; And hath multiplied in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation.
025	LAM	002	006	He hath violently torn away his hedge, like the hedge of a garden; he hath destroyed his place of congregation; Jehovah hath caused the solemn feast and the sabbath to be forgotten in Zion; He hath despised, in his fierce anger, the king and the priest.
025	LAM	002	007	The Lord hath cast off his altar; he hath abhorred his holy place; He hath given up into the hands of the enemy the walls of Zion's palaces; They have lifted up the voice in the house of Jehovah, as in the day of a solemn feast.
025	LAM	002	008	Jehovah hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion; He hath stretched out the line, he hath not withdrawn his hand from destroying; He hath made the rampart and the wall to lament; They languish together.
025	LAM	002	009	Her gates are sunk into the earth; he hath destroyed and broken her bars; Her king and her princes are among the nations; The law is no more; Her prophets also find no vision from Jehovah.
025	LAM	002	010	The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground in silence; They have cast dust upon their heads; they have girded themselves with sackcloth; The virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground.
025	LAM	002	011	Mine eyes do fail with tears; my bowels boil; My liver is poured out upon the ground on account of the destruction of the daughter of my people; For the children and sucklings faint in the streets of the city.
025	LAM	002	012	They say to their mothers, “Where is corn and wine?” While they faint, as one wounded, in the streets of the city; While their life is poured out into their mother's bosom.
025	LAM	002	013	How shall I address thee? what shall I liken to thee, O daughter of Jerusalem? With what shall I compare thee, so as to comfort thee, O virgin daughter of Zion? Surely thy breach is wide, like the sea; who can heal thee?
025	LAM	002	014	Thy prophets declare to thee that which is vain and false; They lay not open to thee thine iniquity, to bring back thy captivity; They pronounce to thee prophecies of falsehood and seduction.
025	LAM	002	015	All that that pass by clap their hands at thee; They hiss, and shake their heads at the daughter of Jerusalem. “Is this the city that men called the perfection of beauty, The joy of the whole earth?”
025	LAM	002	016	All thine enemies open their mouths against thee; They hiss and gnash the teeth; They say: “We have swallowed her up; Yea, this is the day that we looked for; we have found, we have seen it.”
025	LAM	002	017	Jehovah hath accomplished that which he had devised; He hath fulfilled his word, which he had commanded in the days of old; He hath thrown down and hath not pitied; He hath caused thine enemy to rejoice over thee; he hath exalted the horn of thine adversaries.
025	LAM	002	018	Their heart crieth out to the Lord. O wall of the daughter of Zion, let thy tears run down like a river day and night! Give thyself no rest! let not the apple of thine eye cease!
025	LAM	002	019	Arise, cry aloud in the night at the beginning of the watches! Pour out thy heart like water before the face of Jehovah! Lift up thy hands to him for the life of thy young children, That faint for hunger at the head of all the streets!
025	LAM	002	020	“Behold, O Jehovah, and consider! With whom hast thou dealt thus? Shall women eat the fruit of the womb, children borne in the arms? Shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the holy place of the Lord?
025	LAM	002	021	“The boy and the old man lie on the ground in the streets; My virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword; Thou hast slain them in the day of thine anger; Thou hast killed, and hast shown no mercy.
025	LAM	002	022	“Thou hast called, as on a festal day, my terrors around me; There was not one, in the day of Jehovah's anger, that escaped or was left; Those whom I have borne in my arms and brought up hath my enemy consumed.”
025	LAM	003	001	I am the man that hath seen affliction under the rod of His wrath;
025	LAM	003	002	He hath led me and brought me into darkness, and not into light;
025	LAM	003	003	Yea, against me doth he again and again turn his hand all the day long.
025	LAM	003	004	My flesh and my skin hath he made old; he hath broken my bones.
025	LAM	003	005	He hath builded against me, and encompassed me with bitterness and woe.
025	LAM	003	006	He hath set me in dark places, as those that have long been dead.
025	LAM	003	007	He hath hedged me about, so that I cannot get out; he hath made my chain heavy;
025	LAM	003	008	Yea, when I cry and call aloud, he shutteth out my prayer.
025	LAM	003	009	He blocketh up my way with hewn stone; he maketh my paths crooked.
025	LAM	003	010	A bear lying in wait hath he been to me, a lion in lurking-places.
025	LAM	003	011	He hath turned aside my ways, and torn me in pieces; he hath made me desolate.
025	LAM	003	012	He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.
025	LAM	003	013	He hath caused the sons of his quiver to pierce my reins.
025	LAM	003	014	I have been a laughing-stock to all my people, their song all the day.
025	LAM	003	015	He hath filled me with bitterness; he hath made me drunk with wormwood.
025	LAM	003	016	He hath also broken my teeth with gravel-stones; He hath covered me with ashes.
025	LAM	003	017	Yea, thou hast removed my soul far from peace; I have forgotten prosperity.
025	LAM	003	018	And I say, “My confidence and my hope in Jehovah are gone!”
025	LAM	003	019	Remember my affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall!
025	LAM	003	020	Yea, thou wilt remember them, for my soul sinketh within me!
025	LAM	003	021	This I recall to my mind; therefore have I hope;
025	LAM	003	022	It is of the mercy of Jehovah that we are not consumed; yea, his compassion faileth not;
025	LAM	003	023	It is new every morning; great is thy faithfulness.
025	LAM	003	024	Jehovah is my portion, saith my soul, therefore do I hope in him.
025	LAM	003	025	Jehovah is good to them that trust in him, to the soul that seeketh him.
025	LAM	003	026	It is good that a man hope, and quietly wait for salvation from Jehovah.
025	LAM	003	027	It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth;
025	LAM	003	028	That he sit alone and keep silence, since He layeth it upon him;
025	LAM	003	029	That he put his mouth in the dust, [[saying to himself, ]] “Perhaps there may be hope!”
025	LAM	003	030	That he offer his cheek to the smiter; that he be filled with reproach.
025	LAM	003	031	For the Lord will not cast off forever;
025	LAM	003	032	For though he cause grief, yet doth he have compassion according to his great mercy;
025	LAM	003	033	For he doth not willingly afflict and grieve the children of men.
025	LAM	003	034	Doth one trample under foot all the prisoners of the earth,
025	LAM	003	035	Doth he bend the right of a man before the face of the Most High,
025	LAM	003	036	Doth he subvert a man in his cause, and shall not the Lord behold it?
025	LAM	003	037	Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass, when the Lord hath not commanded?
025	LAM	003	038	Cometh not evil, as well as good, from the mouth of the Most High?
025	LAM	003	039	Wherefore then murmureth the living man? Let him murmur at his own sin!
025	LAM	003	040	Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to Jehovah!
025	LAM	003	041	Let us lift up our hearts with our hands to God in the heavens!
025	LAM	003	042	We have transgressed; we have rebelled; thou hast not forgiven!
025	LAM	003	043	Thou hast hidden thyself in anger, and hast pursued us; thou hast slain and hast not spared;
025	LAM	003	044	Thou hast hidden thyself in a cloud, that our prayer may not pass through;
025	LAM	003	045	Thou hast made us the offscouring and refuse in the midst of the nations.
025	LAM	003	046	All our enemies have opened their mouths against us;
025	LAM	003	047	Terror and the pit have come upon us, desolation and destruction;
025	LAM	003	048	Mine eye runneth down with streams of water for the destruction of the daughter of my people.
025	LAM	003	049	Mine eye trickleth down and ceaseth not, without any intermission,
025	LAM	003	050	Until Jehovah look down and behold from heaven.
025	LAM	003	051	Mine eye is painful to me on account of all the daughters of my city.
025	LAM	003	052	They that are my enemies without cause hunt me down like a bird;
025	LAM	003	053	They take away my life in the dungeon; they cast a stone upon me;
025	LAM	003	054	Waters flow over my head; I say, “I am undone!”
025	LAM	003	055	I call upon thy name, O Jehovah, from the deep dungeon;
025	LAM	003	056	Hear thou my voice! hide not thine ear from my cry for relief!
025	LAM	003	057	Be near to me, when I call upon thee! Say, “Fear not!”
025	LAM	003	058	Thou maintainest my cause, O Lord; thou redeemest my life!
025	LAM	003	059	Thou, O Jehovah, seest the wrong done to me; Maintain thou my cause!
025	LAM	003	060	Thou seest all their vengeance, all their devices against me.
025	LAM	003	061	Thou hearest their reproach, O Jehovah, all their devices against me,
025	LAM	003	062	The words of my adversaries, and their machinations against me all the day long!
025	LAM	003	063	Behold their sitting down and their rising up! I am their song.
025	LAM	003	064	Render to them a recompense, O Jehovah, according to the work of their hands!
025	LAM	003	065	Give them blindness of mind! thy curse be upon them!
025	LAM	003	066	Pursue them in thine anger, and destroy them from under Jehovah's heaven!
025	LAM	004	001	How is the gold become dim! how is the most fine gold changed! The hallowed stones are cast forth at the head of every street.
025	LAM	004	002	The noble sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, How are they esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter!
025	LAM	004	003	The very jackals reach forth the breast; they suckle their young; But the daughter of my people is become cruel, like the ostriches of the desert.
025	LAM	004	004	The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst; Young children ask for bread, and no man breaketh it for them.
025	LAM	004	005	Those that fed on dainties are desolate in the streets; Those that have been brought up in scarlet embrace the dunghill.
025	LAM	004	006	The punishment of the daughter of my people is greater than the punishment of Sodom, Which was overthrown in a moment, though no hands came against her.
025	LAM	004	007	Her princes were purer than snow, whiter than milk; More ruddy than coral was their body; Their visage was of sapphire.
025	LAM	004	008	Now darker than a coal is their countenance; they are not known in the streets. Their skin cleaveth to their bones; it is become dry, like wood.
025	LAM	004	009	More fortunate are the slain by the sword than the slain by famine; For these pine away, stricken through for want of the fruits of the field.
025	LAM	004	010	The hands of tender-hearted women cooked their own children; They were their food, in the destruction of the daughter of my people.
025	LAM	004	011	Jehovah hath spent upon them his fury; he hath poured out his fierce anger; He hath kindled a fire in Zion, which hath devoured its foundations.
025	LAM	004	012	The kings of the earth believed not, nor all the inhabitants of the world, That the adversary would enter, and the enemy, within the gates of Jerusalem.
025	LAM	004	013	It was on account of the sins of her prophets, and the iniquities of her priests, Who shed in the midst of her the blood of the righteous.
025	LAM	004	014	They stumbled like blind men through the streets, polluted with blood, So that men could not touch their garments.
025	LAM	004	015	“Depart! unclean!” men cried to them. “Depart, depart, touch not!” As they fled, they stumbled; men said among the nations, “They shall dwell there no more.”
025	LAM	004	016	The anger of Jehovah hath scattered them; he will no more care for them; They paid no regard to the priests, they had no compassion for the elders.
025	LAM	004	017	Still did our eyes fail, looking for help in vain; On our watch-tower did we watch for a nation that could not save us.
025	LAM	004	018	They laid snares for our steps, so that we could not go in our streets; Our end is near; our days are accomplished, yea, our end is come!
025	LAM	004	019	Swifter were our pursuers than the eagles of heaven; They chased us upon the mountains; they laid wait for us in the wilderness.
025	LAM	004	020	The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of Jehovah, was taken in their pits, Under whose shadow we said that we should live among the nations.
025	LAM	004	021	Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwellest in the land of Uz! Yet to thee also shall the cup come! thou shalt be drunken, and shalt expose thy nakedness.
025	LAM	004	022	Thy punishment is at an end, O daughter of Zion! no more will he carry thee into captivity; But thine iniquity will he punish, O daughter of Edom! he will uncover thy sins.
025	LAM	005	001	Remember, O Jehovah, what is come upon us! Look down and behold our reproach!
025	LAM	005	002	Our inheritance is fallen to strangers, Our houses to aliens.
025	LAM	005	003	We are orphans; we are without a father; Our mothers are as widows.
025	LAM	005	004	Our water we drink for money; Our wood is sold to us.
025	LAM	005	005	With the yoke upon our necks, we are driven; We are wearied, and have no rest.
025	LAM	005	006	We have given the hand to the Egyptians, And to the Assyrians, to be satisfied with bread.
025	LAM	005	007	Our fathers sinned; they are no more, And we bear their iniquities.
025	LAM	005	008	Servants rule over us; There is none that delivereth out of their hand.
025	LAM	005	009	With the peril of our lives we get our bread, Because of the sword of the wilderness.
025	LAM	005	010	Our skin is parched like an oven Because of the burnings of hunger.
025	LAM	005	011	Matrons in Zion have they ravished, And maidens in the cities of Judah.
025	LAM	005	012	Princes were hanged up by their hand; The faces of the elders were not honored.
025	LAM	005	013	Young men carried millstones, And boys fell under burdens of wood.
025	LAM	005	014	The elders sit no more at the gate; The young men have ceased from their music.
025	LAM	005	015	The joy of our heart is at an end; Our dancing is turned into mourning.
025	LAM	005	016	The crown is fallen from our head; Woe unto us, that we have sinned!
025	LAM	005	017	For this is our heart faint, For these things our eyes are dim;
025	LAM	005	018	On account of mount Zion, which is desolate; Foxes roam over it.
025	LAM	005	019	But thou, O Jehovah, sittest as king forever; Thy throne endureth from generation to generation.
025	LAM	005	020	Wherefore dost thou wholly forget us, And abandon us, for so long a time?
025	LAM	005	021	Turn us again to thee, O Jehovah, that we may be restored! Renew our days as of old!
025	LAM	005	022	For shouldst thou utterly reject us? Shouldst thou be so exceedingly wroth against us?

# BOOK	026	EZE	Ezekiel	Ezekiel
026	EZE	001	001	Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I was among the captives by the river Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.
026	EZE	001	002	On the fifth day of the month, in the fifth year of the captivity of King Jehoiachin,
026	EZE	001	003	the word of Jehovah came to Ezekiel, the son of Buzi, the priest, in the land of the Chaldaeans, by the river Chebar; and the hand of Jehovah was there upon him.
026	EZE	001	004	And I looked, and behold, a stormy wind came from the north, a great cloud, and a mass of fire; and a brightness was round about it, and in the midst of it the appearance of bright brass, in the midst of the fire.
026	EZE	001	005	And in the midst of it were the forms of four living creatures. And this was their appearance. They had the form of a man.
026	EZE	001	006	And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings.
026	EZE	001	007	And their feet were upright; and the sole of their feet was as the sole of a calf's foot; and they sparkled like polished brass.
026	EZE	001	008	And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides, and all four had faces and wings.
026	EZE	001	009	Their wings were joined one to another; they turned not about when they went; they went every one straight forward.
026	EZE	001	010	As for the form of their faces, all four had the face of a man, and the face of a lion on the right side, and all four had the face of an ox on the left side, and all four had also the face of an eagle.
026	EZE	001	011	Thus were their faces. And their wings were expanded upward; two wings of every one were joined, and two covered their bodies.
026	EZE	001	012	And they went every one straight forward; whither the spirit was to go, they went, and they turned not about when they went.
026	EZE	001	013	And the appearance of the living creatures was as coals of fire, burning like torches; and the fire moved about among the living creatures, and shone forth brightly; and out of the fire came forth lightning.
026	EZE	001	014	And the living creatures ran backward and forward like a flash of lightning.
026	EZE	001	015	Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold, there stood a wheel upon the earth by each of the living creatures, with its four sides.
026	EZE	001	016	The appearance of the wheels, and their work, was like that of a chrysolite, and all four had one form, and their appearance and their work was as if a wheel had been within a wheel.
026	EZE	001	017	When they went, they went upon their four sides, and they turned not about when they went.
026	EZE	001	018	As for their felloes, they were high and terrible; and their felloes were full of eyes round about upon all four of them.
026	EZE	001	019	And when the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them; and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.
026	EZE	001	020	Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went, whithersoever the spirit was to go; and the wheels were lifted up beside them; for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.
026	EZE	001	021	When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up beside them; for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.
026	EZE	001	022	And over the heads of the living creatures was the appearance of a firmament, like crystal, terrible, spread out over their heads above.
026	EZE	001	023	And under the firmament were their wings upright, the one toward the other; and every one had two, which covered his body.
026	EZE	001	024	And I heard the sound of their wings, as the sound of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, when they went, —a sound like the noise of a host. And when they stood still, they let down their wings.
026	EZE	001	025	And there was a voice from the firmament, that was over their heads; and they stood still, and let down their wings.
026	EZE	001	026	And above the firmament over their heads was an appearance like a sapphire-stone, the form of a throne; and upon the form of the throne there was a form like that of a man above.
026	EZE	001	027	And I saw what had the appearance of bright brass, what had the appearance of fire round about within it, from the appearance of his loins and upward. And from the appearance of his loins downward I saw what had the appearance of fire, and its brightness was round about him.
026	EZE	001	028	As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the glory of Jehovah. And when I saw it I fell upon my face, and I heard the voice of one who spoke.
026	EZE	002	001	And he said to me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak with thee.
026	EZE	002	002	And the spirit entered into me when he spoke to me, and set me upon my feet; and I heard him that spake with me.
026	EZE	002	003	And he said to me, Son of man, I send thee to the sons of Israel, to a rebellious nation, that hath rebelled against me; they and their fathers have rebelled against me to this very day.
026	EZE	002	004	Brazen-faced and stiff-hearted are the sons to whom I send thee. And thou shalt say to them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah.
026	EZE	002	005	And whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, for they are a rebellious house, yet shall they know that a prophet is in the midst of them.
026	EZE	002	006	And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, and of their words be not afraid, though they be briers and thorns toward thee, and though thou dwell among scorpions; be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, for they are a rebellious house.
026	EZE	002	007	Speak thou my words to them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, for they are most rebellious.
026	EZE	002	008	But thou, son of man, hear what I say to thee! Be not thou rebellious, like that rebellious house. Open thy mouth, and eat that which I give thee.
026	EZE	002	009	And when I looked, behold, a hand was put forth to me; and lo, a book-roll was therein.
026	EZE	002	010	And he spread it before me, and it was written within and without. And therein was written lamentation and mourning and woe.
026	EZE	003	001	And he said to me, Son of man, eat that which thou findest; eat this roll, and go, speak to the house of Israel!
026	EZE	003	002	So I opened my mouth, and he gave me the roll to eat.
026	EZE	003	003	And he said to me, Son of man, let thy stomach eat, and fill thy body with this roll which I give thee! Then I ate it, and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.
026	EZE	003	004	And he said to me: Son of man, go, get thee to the house of Israel, and speak my words to them!
026	EZE	003	005	For not to a people of a dark speech and a hard language art thou sent, but to the house of Israel;
026	EZE	003	006	not to many nations of a dark speech and a hard language, whose words thou canst not understand. Truly, had I sent thee to them, they would have hearkened to thee.
026	EZE	003	007	But the house of Israel will not hearken to thee, for they will not hearken to me. For the whole house of Israel is brazen-faced and stiff-hearted.
026	EZE	003	008	Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and thy forehead strong against their foreheads.
026	EZE	003	009	As an adamant, harder than flint, have I made thy forehead; fear them not, nor be dismayed at their looks; for they are a rebellious house.
026	EZE	003	010	Moreover, he said to me: Son of man, all my words, which I shall speak to thee, receive in thy heart, and hear with thine ears!
026	EZE	003	011	And go, get thee to them of the captivity, to the children of thy people, and speak to them, and say to them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.
026	EZE	003	012	Then the spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the sound, as of a great rushing, saying, “Praised be the majesty of Jehovah from his place!”
026	EZE	003	013	I heard also the noise of the wings of the living creatures, that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels beside them, even a noise of a great rushing.
026	EZE	003	014	So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of Jehovah was strong upon me.
026	EZE	003	015	Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel-abib, that dwelt by the river Chebar; and I dwelt where they dwelt; I even dwelt astonished among them seven days.
026	EZE	003	016	And at the end of seven days, the word of Jehovah came to me, and said:
026	EZE	003	017	Son of man, I have set thee as a watchman to the house of Israel; therefore hear the word from my mouth, and warn them from me!
026	EZE	003	018	When I say to the wicked, Thou shalt surely die! and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, so that he may live, that wicked man shall die for his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thy hand.
026	EZE	003	019	Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, and from his wicked way, he shall die for his iniquity, but thou hast delivered thy soul.
026	EZE	003	020	Again, when a righteous man turneth from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and I lay a stumbling-block before him, and he shall die because thou hast not given him warning, he will die for his sin; and his righteousness which he hath done will not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thy hand.
026	EZE	003	021	Yet if thou warn the righteous man, that he sin not, and the righteous man doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he hath received warning; and thou hast delivered thy soul.
026	EZE	003	022	And the hand of Jehovah was there upon me, and he said to me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and there will I speak with thee.
026	EZE	003	023	Then I arose, and went forth into the plain, and lo, the glory of Jehovah stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell upon my face.
026	EZE	003	024	Then the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet. And he spake with me, and said to me: Go, shut thyself within thy house.
026	EZE	003	025	And behold, O son of man, bands shall be put upon thee, and thou shalt be bound therewith; and thou shalt not go out among them.
026	EZE	003	026	And I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover; for they are a rebellious house.
026	EZE	003	027	But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say to them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: He that will hear, let him hear, and he that will forbear, let him forbear; for they are a rebellious house.
026	EZE	004	001	And thou, son of man, take thee a tile, and lay it before thee, and portray upon it a city, even Jerusalem.
026	EZE	004	002	And lay siege against it, and build a tower against it, and cast up a mound against it; set a camp also against it, and place battering-rams against it round about.
026	EZE	004	003	Moreover, take thou an iron pan, and set it for a wall of iron between thee and the city; and set thy face against it, that it may be besieged; and lay siege against it. This shall be a sign to the house of Israel.
026	EZE	004	004	Lie thou also upon thy left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it. According to the number of days that thou shalt lie upon it, thou shalt bear their iniquity.
026	EZE	004	005	But for the years of their iniquity I appoint thee days, three hundred and ninety days; so long shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.
026	EZE	004	006	And when thou hast brought them to an end, then lie upon thy right side, and bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days. I have appointed thee a day for a year.
026	EZE	004	007	And set thy face against besieged Jerusalem, and uncover thine arm, and prophesy against it!
026	EZE	004	008	And behold, I will lay bands upon thee, and thou shalt not turn thee from one side to another till thou hast ended the days of thy siege.
026	EZE	004	009	Take thou also wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentiles, and millet, and spelt, and put them into one vessel, and make thereof thy bread for the number of days that thou shalt lie upon thy side; three hundred and ninety days shalt thou eat thereof.
026	EZE	004	010	And thy food which thou eatest shall be by weight, twenty shekels a day; from time to time shalt thou eat it.
026	EZE	004	011	Thou shalt also drink water by measure, the sixth part of a hin; from time to time shalt thou drink.
026	EZE	004	012	Thou shalt also eat barley-cakes; and with dung that cometh out of man shalt thou bake them in their sight.
026	EZE	004	013	And Jehovah said, Even thus shall the sons of Israel eat their polluted food among the nations, whither I will drive them.
026	EZE	004	014	Then said I: Ah! Lord Jehovah, behold, I have never been polluted; for from my youth until now have I not eaten that which died of itself, or was torn in pieces; neither hath unclean food come into my mouth.
026	EZE	004	015	Then he said to me: Behold, I give thee cow's dung for man's dung; and with that shalt thou prepare thy food.
026	EZE	004	016	And he said to me: Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem, and they shall eat bread by weight and with care, and they shall drink water by measure and in amazement;
026	EZE	004	017	so that they shall be in want of bread and water, and be astonished one at another, and consume away for their iniquity.
026	EZE	005	001	And thou, son of man, take thee a sharp instrument, even a barber's razor, and cause it to pass upon thy head and thy beard; and take thee weighing-balances, and divide the hair.
026	EZE	005	002	A third part shalt thou burn with fire in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are fulfilled; and thou shalt take a third part and smite it round about with the sword; and a third part shalt thou scatter in the wind, and I will draw out a sword after them.
026	EZE	005	003	Thou shalt also take thereof a small number, and bind them in thy skirts.
026	EZE	005	004	And of these again take some and cast them into the fire, and burn them in the fire. From them shall a fire come forth upon the whole house of Israel.
026	EZE	005	005	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: This is Jerusalem; in the midst of the nations have I set her, and countries are round about her.
026	EZE	005	006	But she hath wickedly resisted my ordinances more than the nations, and my statutes more than the countries, that are round about her. For they have refused my ordinances, and have not walked in my statutes.
026	EZE	005	007	Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because ye have been rebellious more than the nations that are round about you, and have not walked in my statutes, nor kept my ordinances, but have done according to the ordinances of the nations which are round about you,
026	EZE	005	008	therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold I, even I, am against thee, and will execute judgments against thee in the sight of the nations.
026	EZE	005	009	I will do to thee that which I have not yet done, and the like of which I shall not do again, because of all thine iniquities.
026	EZE	005	010	Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee, and the sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute judgments in thee, and I will scatter the whole remnant of thee to all the winds.
026	EZE	005	011	Therefore, as I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, because thou hast polluted my sanctuary with all thy detestable things, and with all thine abominations, therefore will I also withdraw mine eye from thee; neither will I spare, neither will I have any pity.
026	EZE	005	012	A third part of thee shall die by the pestilence, or be consumed with hunger in the midst of thee; and a third part shall die by the sword round about thee; and a third part will I scatter to all the winds, and I will draw out a sword after them.
026	EZE	005	013	Thus shall mine anger be accomplished, and I will satiate my fury upon them, and receive satisfaction; and they shall know that I, Jehovah, have spoken it in my zeal, when I shall have accomplished my fury upon them.
026	EZE	005	014	Moreover, I will make thee a waste, and a reproach among the nations that are round about thee, in the sight of all that pass by.
026	EZE	005	015	And thou shalt be a reproach, and a reviling, and a warning, and an astonishment to the nations that are round about thee, when I shall execute judgments upon thee in anger, and in fury, and in furious rebukes; —I, Jehovah, have spoken it; —
026	EZE	005	016	when I shall send upon you the evil arrows of famine which bring destruction, which I send to destroy you, and increase the famine upon you, and break your staff of bread.
026	EZE	005	017	And I will send upon you famine, and evil beasts, which shall make thee childless; and pestilence and blood shall pass through thee; and the sword will I bring upon thee. I, Jehovah, have spoken it.
026	EZE	006	001	And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:
026	EZE	006	002	Son of man, set thy face against the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them!
026	EZE	006	003	And say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord Jehovah! Thus saith the Lord Jehovah to the mountains and to the hills, to the plains and to the valleys: Behold, I, even I, will bring the sword upon you, and I will destroy your high places;
026	EZE	006	004	and your altars shall be desolate, and your sun-images shall be broken; and I will cast down your slain before your idols.
026	EZE	006	005	And I will lay the carcasses of the sons of Israel before their idols; and I will scatter your bones round about your altars.
026	EZE	006	006	In all places where ye dwell shall the cities be laid waste, and the high places be desolate; that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate, and your idols may be broken, and cease, and your sun-images may be cut down, and your works may be destroyed.
026	EZE	006	007	And the slain shall fall in the midst of you, that ye may know that I am Jehovah.
026	EZE	006	008	Yet will I leave a remnant, that ye may have some that shall have escaped the sword among the nations, when ye shall be scattered through the countries.
026	EZE	006	009	And they of you that escape shall remember me among the nations whither they shall be carried captives, when I have broken their whorish heart which departed from me, and their eyes which went lusting after their idols; and they shall loathe themselves for the evils which they have committed in all their abominations.
026	EZE	006	010	Then shall they know that I am Jehovah, and that I have not said in vain, that I would do all this evil to them.
026	EZE	006	011	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Smite upon thy hand, and stamp with thy foot, and say, Alas for all the evil abominations of the house of Israel! for by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence shall they fall.
026	EZE	006	012	He that is far off shall die by pestilence, and he that is near shall fall by the sword, and he that remaineth and is preserved shall die by famine. Thus will I accomplish my fury upon them.
026	EZE	006	013	Then shall ye know that I am Jehovah, when their slain men shall be among their idols round about their altars, upon every high hill, upon all the tops of the mountains, and under every green tree, and under every thick oak, in every place where they offered sweet savor to all their idols.
026	EZE	006	014	So will I stretch out my hand against them, and make the land desolate; yea, more desolate than the wilderness toward Diblath, in all their habitations; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
026	EZE	007	001	Moreover, the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:
026	EZE	007	002	Thou son of man, thus saith the Lord Jehovah concerning the land of Israel: —
026	EZE	007	003	The end cometh, the end cometh, Upon the four corners of the land! Now cometh the end upon thee! For I will send my anger upon thee, And will judge thee according to thy ways, And will recompense upon thee all thine abominations.
026	EZE	007	004	And mine eye shall not spare thee, neither will I have pity; But I will recompense thy ways upon thee, And thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee; And ye shall know that I am Jehovah.
026	EZE	007	005	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: An evil, an unheard-of evil, behold, it cometh!
026	EZE	007	006	The end cometh, the end cometh! It awaketh against thee, behold, it cometh!
026	EZE	007	007	Thy fate cometh upon thee, thou that dwellest in the land! The time is come, The day of tumult is near, When no sound of joy shall be upon the mountains.
026	EZE	007	008	Now will I shortly pour out my fury upon thee, And accomplish mine anger against thee; And I will judge thee according to thy ways, And recompense upon thee all thine abominations.
026	EZE	007	009	And mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity; I will recompense thee according to thy ways, And thine abominations shall come upon thee; And ye shall know that I, Jehovah, smite you.
026	EZE	007	010	Behold, the day, behold, it cometh! The destiny draweth near; The rod hath blossomed, pride hath flourished.
026	EZE	007	011	Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness; None of them shall remain, none of their multitude, none of their crowd; Nor shall there be wailing for them.
026	EZE	007	012	The time cometh, the day draweth near! Let not the buyer rejoice, Nor the seller mourn; For wrath is against their whole multitude.
026	EZE	007	013	For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, Though he be yet alive; For the vision against their whole multitude shall not return void, And none that liveth in his iniquity shall strengthen himself
026	EZE	007	014	“Blow ye the trumpet, and let all be ready!” Yet none goeth to the battle; For mine anger is against their whole multitude.
026	EZE	007	015	The sword is without, and pestilence and famine within; He that is in the field shall die by the sword; And he that is in the city, famine and pestilence shall devour him.
026	EZE	007	016	And those of them that escape shall be upon the mountains like doves of the valleys, All of them mourning, every one for his iniquity.
026	EZE	007	017	All hands shall be feeble, And all knees shall flow with water.
026	EZE	007	018	They shall also gird themselves with sackcloth, And horror shall cover them. And upon all their faces shall be shame, And upon all their heads baldness.
026	EZE	007	019	Their silver shall they cast into the streets, And their gold shall be as an unclean thing. Their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them In the day of the wrath of Jehovah; Their hunger shall not be satisfied, Nor their body filled with it; For it was the stumbling-block of their iniquity.
026	EZE	007	020	For the beauty of their ornaments they turned into pride, And the images of their abominations and of their detestable things they made with it; Therefore will I make it to them as an unclean thing.
026	EZE	007	021	And I will give it into the hands of strangers for a prey, And to the wicked of the earth for a spoil, And they shall pollute it.
026	EZE	007	022	And I will turn my face from them, So that my secret place shall be polluted; Robbers shall enter into it, and pollute it.
026	EZE	007	023	Make a chain! For the land is full of blood-guiltiness, And the city is full of violence.
026	EZE	007	024	Therefore will I bring the most cruel among the nations, And they shall possess your houses; I will also make the pride of the strong to cease, And their holy places shall be defiled.
026	EZE	007	025	Destruction cometh; And they shall seek peace, and not find it.
026	EZE	007	026	Calamity shall come upon calamity, And rumor shall be upon rumor; And they shall seek a vision from the prophet in vain; Instruction shall perish from the priests, And counsel from the elders.
026	EZE	007	027	The king shall mourn, And the prince shall be clothed with amazement; And the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled. I will do to them according to their way, and according to their deserts will I judge them, And they shall know that I am Jehovah.
026	EZE	008	001	Now it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, on the fifth day of the month, as I sat in my house, and the elders of Judah sat before me, that the hand of the Lord Jehovah fell there upon me.
026	EZE	008	002	And I looked, and lo, a form having the appearance of fire; from the appearance of his loins downward, of fire; and from his loins upward, of a bright light, like the splendor of shining brass.
026	EZE	008	003	And he put forth the form of a hand, and took me by a lock of my head. And the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven, and brought me, in the visions of God, to Jerusalem, to the door of the inner gate, that looketh toward the north, where stood the idol of jealousy, which provoketh to jealousy.
026	EZE	008	004	And behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, according to the vision which I saw in the plain.
026	EZE	008	005	Then said he to me, Son of man, lift up thine eyes toward the north! And I lifted up my eyes toward the north, and behold, northward from the gate of the altar was this idol of jealousy, at the entrance.
026	EZE	008	006	And he said to me: Son of man, seest thou what they do? Great are the abominations which the house of Israel commit here, that I should go far off from my sanctuary. But thou shalt yet again see great abominations.
026	EZE	008	007	And he brought me to the door of the court, and I looked, and behold, a hole in the wall.
026	EZE	008	008	And he said to me, Son of man, break now through the wall. And when I had broken through the wall, behold, a door.
026	EZE	008	009	And he said to me, Go in, and behold the wicked abominations which they practise here.
026	EZE	008	010	So I went in and saw, and behold, every form of creeping things, and of abominable beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel, portrayed upon the wall round about.
026	EZE	008	011	And there stood before them seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel, Jaazaniah, the son of Shaphan, standing in the midst of them, with every man his censer in his hand; and a thick cloud of incense went up.
026	EZE	008	012	Then said he to me: Son of man, seest thou what the elders of the house of Israel do in the dark, each one in his image-chamber? For they say, “Jehovah seeth us not; Jehovah hath forsaken the land.”
026	EZE	008	013	And he said to me, Thou shalt yet again see the great abominations which they practise.
026	EZE	008	014	Then he brought me to the entrance of the gate of the house of Jehovah, which was toward the north, and behold, there sat women, weeping for Thammuz.
026	EZE	008	015	And he said to me, Seest thou this, O son of man? Thou shalt yet again see greater abominations than these.
026	EZE	008	016	And he brought me into the inner court of the house of Jehovah, and behold, at the entrance of the temple of Jehovah, between the porch and the altar, were about five and twenty men, with their backs toward the temple of Jehovah, and their faces toward the east; and they bowed themselves eastward toward the sun.
026	EZE	008	017	And he said to me: Seest thou, O son of man? Is it a light thing to the house of Judah, that they commit the abominations which they commit here, that they fill the land with violence, and continually provoke me to anger? And behold, they put the blanch to their nostrils.
026	EZE	008	018	Therefore will I also deal with them in fury; mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity; and though they cry in mine ears with a loud voice, yet will I not hear them.
026	EZE	009	001	He cried also, in my hearing, with a loud voice, saying: Bring ye near the punishments of the city, every one his weapon of destruction in his hand.
026	EZE	009	002	And lo, six men came from the way of the higher gate, which looketh toward the north, every one with his slaughter-weapon in his hand; and one man among them was clothed with linen, with a writer's ink-horn by his side; and they went in, and stood beside the brazen altar.
026	EZE	009	003	And the glory of the God of Israel went up from the cherub upon which it was to the threshold of the house; and he called to the man clothed with linen, who had the writer's ink-horn by his side;
026	EZE	009	004	and Jehovah said to him, Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that wail for all the abominations that are done in the midst thereof.
026	EZE	009	005	And to the others he said, in my hearing, Go ye after him through the city, and smite! let not your eyes spare, neither have ye pity!
026	EZE	009	006	The old man, the youth, the virgin, little children and women, slay and destroy; but come not near any one upon whom is the mark; and begin at my sanctuary. Then began they at the elders that were before the house.
026	EZE	009	007	And he said to them, Pollute the house, and fill the courts with the slain, then go ye forth. And they went forth, and slew in the city.
026	EZE	009	008	And while they were smiting them, I alone was left; and I fell upon my face, and cried, and said, Ah, Lord Jehovah! wilt thou destroy all the remnant of Israel, while thou pourest out thy fury upon Jerusalem?
026	EZE	009	009	And he said to me: The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great, and the land is full of blood, and the city full of perverseness. For they say, “Jehovah hath forsaken the land”; and, “Jehovah seeth not.”
026	EZE	009	010	Therefore mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity. Their way will I recompense upon their head.
026	EZE	009	011	And lo, the man clothed with linen, who had the ink-horn by his side, returned answer, saying, I have done as thou hast commanded me.
026	EZE	010	001	Then I looked, and lo, in the firmament that was above the head of the cherubs there appeared over them as it were a sapphire-stone, in form like a throne;
026	EZE	010	002	and He spake to the man that was clothed with linen, and said, Go in between the wheels under the cherub, and fill thy hands with coals of fire, which are between the cherubs, and scatter them over the city. And he went in before my eyes.
026	EZE	010	003	Now the cherubs stood upon the right side of the house when the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court.
026	EZE	010	004	And the glory of Jehovah was lifted up from the cherub to the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was filled with the brightness of the glory of Jehovah.
026	EZE	010	005	And the sound of the wings of the cherubs was heard even to the outer court, as the voice of God, the Almighty, when he speaketh.
026	EZE	010	006	And when he commanded the man clothed with linen, saying, Take fire from between the wheels, from between the cherubs, he went in and stood beside the wheels.
026	EZE	010	007	And one cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubs to the fire that was between the cherubs, and took thereof, and put it into the hands of him that was clothed with linen, who took it, and went out.
026	EZE	010	008	And there was seen in the cherubs the form of a man's hand under their wings.
026	EZE	010	009	And when I looked, behold, four wheels were by the cherubs, one wheel by one cherub, and another wheel by another cherub; and the appearance of the wheels was like that of a chrysolite.
026	EZE	010	010	And as to their appearance, all four had one form, as if a wheel were in the midst of a wheel.
026	EZE	010	011	When they went, they went upon their four sides; they turned not about when they went; but to the place whither the head looked they followed it, they turned not about when they went.
026	EZE	010	012	And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes round about, even the wheels which they four had.
026	EZE	010	013	And as to these wheels, each one of them in my hearing was called Whirlwind.
026	EZE	010	014	And every one had four faces. The first face was the face of a cherub, and the second face was the face of a man, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.
026	EZE	010	015	And the cherubs were lifted up. They were the living creatures which I saw by the river Chebar.
026	EZE	010	016	And when the cherubs went, the wheels went with them; and when the cherubs lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the wheels turned not away from their side.
026	EZE	010	017	When they stood, these stood; and when they were lifted up, these were liked up with them. For the spirit of the living creatures was in them.
026	EZE	010	018	Then the glory of Jehovah departed from the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubs.
026	EZE	010	019	And the cherubs lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight, as they went out, and the wheels were beside them. And they stood at the entrance of the east gate of the house of Jehovah, and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.
026	EZE	010	020	They were the living creatures which I saw under the God of Israel by the river Chebar; and I knew that they were the cherubs.
026	EZE	010	021	Every one had four faces, and every one four wings, and the form of a man's hand was under their wings.
026	EZE	010	022	And as for the form of their faces, they were the faces which I saw by the river Chebar, their appearances and themselves. They went every one straight forward.
026	EZE	011	001	Then the spirit lifted me up, and brought me to the east gate of the house of Jehovah, that looketh toward the east; and behold, at the entrance of the gate were five and twenty men; among whom I saw Jaazaniah, the son of Azur, and Pelatiah, the son of Benaiah, princes of the people.
026	EZE	011	002	Then said He to me: These are the men that devise mischief, and form evil designs in this city;
026	EZE	011	003	who say, “The time is not near that we should build houses. This city is the caldron, and we are the flesh.”
026	EZE	011	004	Therefore, prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man!
026	EZE	011	005	And the spirit of Jehovah fell upon me, and he said to me, Speak: Thus saith Jehovah: Thus have ye said, O house of Israel! For I know the things that come into your mind, every one of them.
026	EZE	011	006	Ye have multiplied your slain in this city, and ye have filled the streets thereof with the slain.
026	EZE	011	007	Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Your slain, whom ye have laid in the midst of it, they are the flesh, and this city is the caldron; but you will I bring forth out of the midst of it.
026	EZE	011	008	Ye have feared the sword, and the sword will I bring upon you, saith the Lord Jehovah.
026	EZE	011	009	And I will bring you out of the midst thereof, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and execute judgments upon you.
026	EZE	011	010	Ye shall fall by the sword; on the borders of Israel will I judge you, that ye may know that I am Jehovah.
026	EZE	011	011	This city shall not be your caldron, neither shall ye be the flesh in the midst thereof. On the borders of Israel will I judge you,
026	EZE	011	012	that ye may know that I am Jehovah, in whose statutes ye have not walked, and whose ordinances ye have not observed, but have done according to the manners of the nations, that are round about you.
026	EZE	011	013	And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah, the son of Benaiah, died. Then I fell down on my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah, Lord Jehovah, wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of Israel?
026	EZE	011	014	And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:
026	EZE	011	015	Son of man, thy brethren, even thy brethren, the men of thy near kindred, and the whole house of Israel, are they to whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem say, “Remove ye far from Jehovah; to us is the land given in possession!”
026	EZE	011	016	Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Though I have cast them far off among the nations, and scattered them among the countries, yet I will be to them as a sanctuary for a short time in the countries whither they are come.
026	EZE	011	017	Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will gather you from the nations, and assemble you from the countries where ye have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.
026	EZE	011	018	And they shall come thither, and they shall take away from thence all the detestable things thereof, and all the abominations thereof.
026	EZE	011	019	And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within them; and I will take out of them the heart of stone, and will give them a heart of flesh,
026	EZE	011	020	that they may walk in my statutes, and observe my ordinances, and keep them; and they shall be my people, and I will be their God.
026	EZE	011	021	But as for them whose heart walketh according to the pleasure of their detestable things and their abominations, I will recompense their way upon their heads, saith the Lord Jehovah.
026	EZE	011	022	Then did the cherubs lift up their wings, and the wheels were beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.
026	EZE	011	023	And the glory of Jehovah went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city.
026	EZE	011	024	Then the spirit took me up, and brought me to Chaldaea, to them of the captivity, in vision, by the spirit of God. And the vision which I had seen went up from me.
026	EZE	011	025	Then I spake to them of the captivity all the words of Jehovah which he had showed me.
026	EZE	012	001	And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:
026	EZE	012	002	Son of man, thou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious house; they have eyes to see, and see not; they have ears to hear, and hear not; for they are a rebellious house.
026	EZE	012	003	Therefore, thou son of man, prepare thee stuff for removing from the land; and remove by day in their sight, and remove from thy place to another place before their eyes. It may be they will consider, though they be a rebellious house.
026	EZE	012	004	And carry forth thy stuff, as stuff for removing, by day in their sight, and go forth at even in their sight, as they that go forth into captivity.
026	EZE	012	005	Before their eyes break thou through the wall, and carry forth thereby.
026	EZE	012	006	In their sight bear it upon thy shoulders, and carry it forth in the twilight. Cover thy face, so that thou see not the ground; for I have made thee a sign to the house of Israel.
026	EZE	012	007	And I did as I was commanded, I carried forth my stuff, as stuff for removing from the land, by day; and in the evening I broke through the wall with my hand; I carried it forth in the twilight; I took it upon my shoulder before their eyes.
026	EZE	012	008	And the word of Jehovah came to me in the morning, and said:
026	EZE	012	009	Son of man, hath not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said to thee, “What doest thou?”
026	EZE	012	010	Say to them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: This burden concerneth the prince in Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel that is therein.
026	EZE	012	011	Say, I am your sign. As I have done, so shall it be done to them. They shall remove and go into captivity.
026	EZE	012	012	And the prince that is among them shall bear upon his shoulder in the twilight, and shall go forth. They shall break through the wall to carry forth thereby; he shall cover his face, that he see not the ground with his eyes.
026	EZE	012	013	I will also spread my net upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare, and I will bring him to Babylon, into the land of the Chaldaeans; yet he shall not see it, though he shall die there.
026	EZE	012	014	And all that are round about him to help him, and all his bands, will I scatter to every wind; and I will draw out the sword after them.
026	EZE	012	015	And they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I shall disperse them among the nations, and scatter them in the countries.
026	EZE	012	016	But I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the famine, and from the pestilence; that they may declare all their abominations among the heathen, whither they come; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
026	EZE	012	017	And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:
026	EZE	012	018	Son of man, eat thy bread with quaking, and drink thy water with trembling and with carefulness;
026	EZE	012	019	and say to the people of the land: Thus saith the Lord Jehovah concerning the inhabitants of Jerusalem in the land of Israel; their bread shall they eat with carefulness, and their water shall they drink with astonishment; that their land may be desolate from all that is therein, because of the violence of them that dwell in it.
026	EZE	012	020	And the inhabited cities shall be laid waste, and the land shall be desolate, that ye may know that I am Jehovah.
026	EZE	012	021	And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:
026	EZE	012	022	Son of man, what meaneth that proverb which ye have in the land of Israel, saying, “The days are delayed, and every vision faileth”?
026	EZE	012	023	Therefore say to them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will make this proverb to cease, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel. But say to them, The days are at hand, and what is declared in every vision.
026	EZE	012	024	For there shall be no longer any vain vision or deceptive divination within the house of Israel.
026	EZE	012	025	For I am Jehovah; I speak, and the word which I speak shall come to pass; it shall no more be delayed. In your own days, ye rebellious house, will I speak the word and perform it, saith the Lord Jehovah.
026	EZE	012	026	And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:
026	EZE	012	027	Son of man, behold, they of the house of Israel say, “The vision which he seeth is for many days to come, and he prophesieth of times that are far off.”
026	EZE	012	028	Therefore say to them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: There shall none of my words be deferred any more; what I speak shall be done, saith the Lord Jehovah.
026	EZE	013	001	And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:
026	EZE	013	002	Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel that prophesy, and say to them that prophesy out of their own hearts, Hear ye the word of Jehovah!
026	EZE	013	003	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Woe to the foolish prophets, that follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing!
026	EZE	013	004	Thy prophets, O Israel, are like the foxes in the deserts.
026	EZE	013	005	Ye have not gone up into the breaches, nor built a wall around the house of Israel, to stand in battle in the day of Jehovah.
026	EZE	013	006	They see falsehood, and lying divination. They say, “Jehovah hath spoken,” when Jehovah hath not sent them; and they cause men to hope for the fulfilment of the word.
026	EZE	013	007	Have ye not seen a false vision, and have ye not spoken a lying divination, and said, “Jehovah hath spoken,” when I have not spoken?
026	EZE	013	008	Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because ye have spoken falsehood and have seen a lie, therefore, behold, I am against you, saith the Lord Jehovah.
026	EZE	013	009	My hand shall be against the prophets that see falsehood and divine lies. They shall not be in the assembly of my people, neither shall they be written in the register of the house of Israel, neither shall they enter into the land of Israel: and ye shall know that I am the Lord Jehovah.
026	EZE	013	010	Because, yea, because they seduce my people, and say, “Peace!” when there is no peace; and one buildeth up a wall, and, behold, they daub it with untempered mortar;
026	EZE	013	011	say to them which daub it with untempered mortar, that it shall fall; there shall be an overflowing shower, and ye, O great hailstones, shall fall, and a stormy wind shall rend it.
026	EZE	013	012	So when the wall is fallen, shall not men say to you, “Where is the daubing wherewith ye have daubed it?”
026	EZE	013	013	Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will even rend it with a stormy wind in my fury, and there shall be an overflowing shower in mine anger, and great hailstones in my fury to consume it.
026	EZE	013	014	Thus I will break down the wall which ye have daubed with untempered mortar, and will bring it down to the ground, so that the foundation thereof shall be discovered; it shall fall, and ye shall be consumed in the midst thereof, that ye may know that I am Jehovah.
026	EZE	013	015	Thus will I accomplish my fury upon the wall, and upon them that daubed it with untempered mortar; and I will say to you, The wall is no more, nor they that daubed it;
026	EZE	013	016	even the prophets of Israel, who prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and see visions of peace for her when there is no peace, saith the Lord Jehovah.
026	EZE	013	017	Likewise, son of man, set thou thy face against the daughters of thy people, who prophesy out of their own heart; and prophesy thou against them.
026	EZE	013	018	And say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Woe to the women that sew cushions for all elbows, and make pillows for heads of every stature, to ensnare men to destruction! Will ye hunt the lives of my people, and shall ye save your own?
026	EZE	013	019	And will ye pollute me among my people for handfuls of barley, and for pieces of bread, slaying them that should not die, and saving them alive that should not live, by lying to my people, who hearken to your lies?
026	EZE	013	020	Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will set myself against the cushions with which ye ensnare men to destruction, so that they shall escape you; and I will tear them from your arms, and make them free whom ye would ensnare, so that they shall escape you.
026	EZE	013	021	Your pillows also will I tear, and deliver my people out of your hand, and they shall no more be in your hand to be ensnared, and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.
026	EZE	013	022	Because with lies ye have made sad the heart of the righteous, whom I have not made sad, and have strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he should not return from his wicked way, by promising him life;
026	EZE	013	023	therefore shall ye no more see falsehood, nor divine divinations; but I will deliver my people out of your hand, and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.
026	EZE	014	001	Now certain men of the elders of Israel came to me, and sat before me.
026	EZE	014	002	And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:
026	EZE	014	003	Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their heart, and have put the stumbling-block of their iniquity before their face; shall I hear them when they inquire of me?
026	EZE	014	004	Therefore speak with them, and say to them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Every man of the house of Israel that setteth up his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumbling-block of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to the prophet, —I, Jehovah, will answer him according to the multitude of his idols;
026	EZE	014	005	that I may lay hold of the house of Israel in their hearts, because they are all estranged from me through their idols.
026	EZE	014	006	Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Turn ye, even turn yourselves from your idols, and from all your abominations turn ye your faces!
026	EZE	014	007	For every one of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, who separateth himself from me, and setteth up his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumbling-block of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to the prophet to inquire of me through him, —I, Jehovah, will answer him by myself.
026	EZE	014	008	And I will set my face against that man, and will make him a sign and a proverb, and will cut him off from the midst of my people; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.
026	EZE	014	009	And when the prophet is deceived when he speaketh anything, I, Jehovah, have deceived that prophet; and I will stretch out my hand upon him, and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel.
026	EZE	014	010	And they shall bear the punishment of their iniquity; the punishment of the prophet shall be even as the punishment of him that inquireth of him;
026	EZE	014	011	that the house of Israel may no more go astray from me, nor be polluted any more with all their transgressions; but that they may be my people, and I may be their God, saith the Lord Jehovah.
026	EZE	014	012	Again the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:
026	EZE	014	013	Son of man, when a land sinneth against me, and grievously transgresseth, and I stretch out my hand against it, and break the staff of its bread, and send famine upon it, and cut off from it man and beast,
026	EZE	014	014	though these three men were in it, Noah, Daniel, and Job, they should deliver only themselves by their righteousness, saith the Lord Jehovah.
026	EZE	014	015	When I cause wild beasts to pass through the land, and they spoil it, and it be desolate so that none passeth through it because of the beasts,
026	EZE	014	016	though these three men were in it, as I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, they should deliver neither sons nor daughters; they only should be delivered, but the land should be desolate.
026	EZE	014	017	Or when I bring a sword upon that land, and say, Sword, go through the land so that I cut off from it man and beast,
026	EZE	014	018	though these three men were in it, as I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, they should deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they only should be delivered themselves.
026	EZE	014	019	Or when I send a pestilence upon that land, and pour out my fury upon it in blood, to cut off from it man and beast,
026	EZE	014	020	though Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it, as I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, they should deliver neither son nor daughter; they should deliver only themselves by their righteousness.
026	EZE	014	021	Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: How much more, when I send my four grievous judgments against Jerusalem, the sword, and the famine, and the wild beast, and the pestilence, to cut off from it man and beast?
026	EZE	014	022	Yet behold, therein shall be left a remnant that shall be brought forth, sons and daughters. Behold, they shall come forth to you, and ye shall see their way and their doings, and ye shall be comforted concerning the evil which I have brought upon Jerusalem, even concerning all which I have brought upon her.
026	EZE	014	023	They shall comfort you, when ye see their ways and their doings; and ye shall know that not without cause I have done all that I have done to her, saith the Lord Jehovah.
026	EZE	015	001	And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:
026	EZE	015	002	Son of man, what is the wood of the vine more than any wood, —a branch, that is among the trees of the forest?
026	EZE	015	003	Shall wood be taken from it to be wrought into any work? Or will men take a pin of it to hang a vessel upon?
026	EZE	015	004	Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire devoureth both the ends of it, and the middle of it is burned. Is it then fit for any work?
026	EZE	015	005	Behold, when it was whole, nothing could be made of it; how much less can anything be made of it when the fire hath devoured it and it is burned!
026	EZE	015	006	Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: As the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so will I give to it the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
026	EZE	015	007	And I will set my face against them; they shall go out from one fire, and another fire shall devour them; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah, when I set my face against them.
026	EZE	015	008	And I will make the land desolate, because they have grievously trespassed, saith the Lord Jehovah.
026	EZE	016	001	And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:
026	EZE	016	002	Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations,
026	EZE	016	003	and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah to Jerusalem: Thine origin and thy nativity were of the land of Canaan. Thy father was an Amorite, and thy mother a Hittite.
026	EZE	016	004	And as to thy nativity, in the day thou wast born thy navel was not cut, neither wast thou washed in water so as to be cleansed. Thou wast not sprinkled with salt, nor wrapped in swaddling-clothes.
026	EZE	016	005	No eye pitied thee, to do to thee any of these things, to have compassion upon thee; but thou wast cast out into the open field, so as to loathe thyself, on the day thou wast born.
026	EZE	016	006	And when I passed by thee, and saw thee in danger of being trodden under foot in thy blood, I said to thee when thou wast in thy blood, Live! yea, I said to thee when thou wast in thy blood, Live!
026	EZE	016	007	I caused thee to increase like the plant of the field, and thou didst grow, and become tall, and didst attain to distinguished charms. Thy breasts swelled, and thy hair grew, whereas thou wast naked and bare.
026	EZE	016	008	And when I passed by thee, and saw thee, behold, it was thy time, the time of love. And I spread my skirt over thee and covered thy nakedness; and I swore to thee, and entered into covenant with thee, and thou becamest mine.
026	EZE	016	009	Then I washed thee with water, yea, I thoroughly washed away thy blood from thee, and I anointed thee with oil.
026	EZE	016	010	I clothed thee also with broidered work, and gave thee shoes of seal's skin, and wrapped thee about with fine linen, and covered thee with silk.
026	EZE	016	011	And I decked thee with ornaments, and put bracelets upon thy hands, and a chain upon thy neck.
026	EZE	016	012	And I put a jewel in thy nostril, and ear-rings in thine ears, and a beautiful crown upon thy head.
026	EZE	016	013	Thus wast thou adorned with gold and silver, and thy raiment was of fine linen, and silk, and broidered work. Fine flour and honey and oil didst thou eat; and thou wast exceedingly beautiful, and didst prosper so as to become a queen.
026	EZE	016	014	And thy renown went forth among the nations for thy beauty; for it was perfect through my comeliness, which I had put upon thee, saith the Lord Jehovah.
026	EZE	016	015	But thou didst trust in thy beauty, and didst play the harlot because of thy renown, and didst lavish thy fornications on every one that passed by; his was it.
026	EZE	016	016	And of thy garments thou didst take, and didst make thee high places, spread with divers colors, and didst play the harlot thereon, the like things to which shall not come to pass, neither shall they be.
026	EZE	016	017	Thou didst take also thy fair jewels of my gold and my silver, which I gave thee, and didst make to thyself images of men, and didst commit fornication with them;
026	EZE	016	018	and thou didst take thy broidered garments and cover them; and thou didst set mine oil and mine incense before them.
026	EZE	016	019	My food also, which I gave thee, fine flour and oil and honey, wherewith I fed thee, thou didst set it before them with a sweet savor; even thus it was, saith the Lord Jehovah.
026	EZE	016	020	Moreover thou didst take thy sons and thy daughters, whom thou didst bear to me, and these didst thou sacrifice to them to be devoured. Was it not enough for thee to commit fornication,
026	EZE	016	021	that thou didst slay my children, and deliver them up to cause them to pass through the fire to them?
026	EZE	016	022	And in all thine abominations and thy fornications, thou didst not remember the days of thy youth, when thou wast naked and bare, and in danger of being trampled under foot in thy blood.
026	EZE	016	023	And it came to pass, after all thy wickedness, (woe, woe to thee! saith the Lord Jehovah, )
026	EZE	016	024	that thou didst build for thee an arched place, and make thee a high place in every street;
026	EZE	016	025	at every head of the way didst thou build thy high place, and didst make thy beauty to be abhorred, and didst open thy feet to every one that passed by, and didst multiply thy fornications.
026	EZE	016	026	Thou hast also committed fornication with the Egyptians, thy neighbors, having great members, and hast multiplied thy fornications to provoke me to anger.
026	EZE	016	027	Therefore, behold, I have stretched out my hand against thee, and have diminished thine allowance, and delivered thee to the will of them that hate thee, the daughters of the Philistines, who are ashamed of thy lewd way.
026	EZE	016	028	Thou hast also committed fornication with the Assyrians, because thou wast insatiable; yea, thou hast played the harlot with them, and yet couldst not be satisfied.
026	EZE	016	029	Thou hast also multiplied thy fornication with the land of Canaan, even to Chaldaea; and yet wast thou not satisfied therewith.
026	EZE	016	030	How faint was thy heart, saith the Lord Jehovah, that thou didst all those things which an imperious whorish wife doeth,
026	EZE	016	031	in that thou didst build thine arched place at the head of every way, and make thy high place in every street! Thou wast not like a harlot, who scoffeth at her hire,
026	EZE	016	032	but as an adulterous wife, that taketh strangers instead of her husband.
026	EZE	016	033	To all women that commit fornication men give a reward; but thou gavest thy gifts to all thy lovers, and hiredst them to come to thee from every side to commit fornication with thee.
026	EZE	016	034	Thou wast the reverse of other women in thy fornications. None followed after thee to commit fornication, but thou gavest the reward, and no reward was given thee, —therefore thou wast the reverse.
026	EZE	016	035	Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word of Jehovah!
026	EZE	016	036	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because thy treasure was poured out, and thy nakedness discovered for fornication before thy lovers, and all thine abominable idols, and because of the blood of thy children, which thou didst give to them,
026	EZE	016	037	therefore, behold, I will gather all thy lovers, to whom thou wast pleasing, all them that thou hast loved, with all them that thou hast hated, I will gather them against thee round about, and will uncover thy nakedness to them, that they may see all thy nakedness.
026	EZE	016	038	And I will judge thee as women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged, and I will cause thy blood to flow in fury and jealousy.
026	EZE	016	039	And I will give thee into their hand, and they shall throw down thine arched place, and break down thy high places. They shall also strip thee of thy clothes, and leave thee naked and bare.
026	EZE	016	040	They shall also bring up a company against thee, and they shall stone thee with stones, and thrust thee through with their swords;
026	EZE	016	041	and they shall burn thine houses with fire, and execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many women; and I will cause thee to cease from playing the harlot, and thou shalt give hire no more.
026	EZE	016	042	So will I make my fury toward thee to rest, and my jealousy shall depart from thee; and I will be quiet, and will be no more angry.
026	EZE	016	043	Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but hast raged against me in all these things, therefore I also will recompense thy way upon thy head, saith the Lord Jehovah, so that thou shalt not commit this wickedness in addition to all thy abominations.
026	EZE	016	044	Behold, all they that use proverbs shall utter this proverb concerning thee: “As the mother, so the daughter.”
026	EZE	016	045	Thou art the daughter of thy mother, that loathed her husband and her children; and thou art the sister of thy sisters, that loathed their husbands and their children; your mother was a Hittite, and your father an Amorite.
026	EZE	016	046	And thine elder sister is Samaria, with her daughters, that dwelleth at thy left hand; and thy younger sister, that dwelleth at thy right hand, is Sodom, with her daughters.
026	EZE	016	047	Yet thou hast not walked in their ways, nor done according to their abominations: that was disdained by you, as a very little thing; thou hast been more corrupt than they in all thy ways.
026	EZE	016	048	As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, Sodom, thy sister, hath not done, she nor her daughters, as thou hast done, thou and thy daughters.
026	EZE	016	049	Behold, this was the iniquity of Sodom, thy sister: in pride, superabundance, and careless ease did she live, she and her daughters, and the hand of the poor and needy she did not strengthen;
026	EZE	016	050	and they were haughty, and committed abomination before me; therefore I took them away when I saw it.
026	EZE	016	051	Neither hath Samaria committed half of thy sins; but thou hast multiplied thine abominations more than they, and hast justified thy sisters in all thine abominations which thou hast done.
026	EZE	016	052	Now, therefore, bear thou thy shame, to which thou hast condemned thy sisters, since by thy sins which thou hast committed, more abominable than they, they are more righteous than thou. Yea, be thou confounded and bear thy shame, in that thou hast justified thy sisters.
026	EZE	016	053	Yet I will bring them back from their captivity, even Sodom and her daughters from their captivity, and Samaria and her daughters from their captivity; thee also will I bring back from thy captivity in the midst of them;
026	EZE	016	054	that thou mayst bear thy shame, and mayst be confounded on account of all which thou hast done, in that thou art a comfort to them.
026	EZE	016	055	And thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their former estate, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate, and thou and thy daughters shall return to your former estate.
026	EZE	016	056	And yet Sodom, thy sister, was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day of thy pride
026	EZE	016	057	before thy wickedness was discovered, as in the time of thy reproach from the daughters of Syria, and from all that were round about her, and from the daughters of the Philistines, who despised thee round about.
026	EZE	016	058	Thy wickedness and thine abominations must thou now bear, saith the Lord Jehovah.
026	EZE	016	059	For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will do to thee as thou hast done, who hast despised the oath and hast broken the covenant.
026	EZE	016	060	But I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will establish with thee an everlasting covenant.
026	EZE	016	061	Then shalt thou remember thy ways, and be ashamed, when thou shalt receive thy sisters, thine elder and thy younger, and I shall give them to thee for daughters, but not by thy observance of thy covenant.
026	EZE	016	062	But I will establish my covenant with thee, and thou shalt know that I am Jehovah;
026	EZE	016	063	that thou mayst remember and be confounded, and not open thy mouth any more for shame, when I forgive thee all which thou hast done, saith the Lord Jehovah.
026	EZE	017	001	And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:
026	EZE	017	002	Son of man, put forth a riddle, and speak a parable to the house of Israel;
026	EZE	017	003	and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: A great eagle, with great wings, with long feathers, full of plumage, which had divers colors, came to Lebanon, and took the highest branch of a cedar.
026	EZE	017	004	He cropped off the top of its young twigs, and carried it into a land of traffic; he set it in a city of merchants.
026	EZE	017	005	He took also one of the shoots of the land, and put it in a fruitful field; he placed it by great waters, and set it as a willow-tree.
026	EZE	017	006	And it grew and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose branches turned towards him, and whose roots were under him. It became a vine, that brought forth branches, and shot forth boughs.
026	EZE	017	007	There was also another great eagle, with great wings and many feathers; and, behold, this vine bent its roots toward him, and shot forth its branches toward him, that he might water it from the beds where it was planted.
026	EZE	017	008	And yet it was planted in a good soil, by great waters, that it might bring forth branches, and that it might bear fruit, and be a goodly vine.
026	EZE	017	009	Say thou, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Shall it prosper? Shall not he pull up its roots, and cut off its fruit, that it wither? In all the leaves of its branching shall it wither; even without a mighty arm, or many people, shall he pluck it up by the roots.
026	EZE	017	010	Yea, behold, it is planted; but shall it prosper? Shall it not utterly wither, when the east wind toucheth it? It shall wither in the beds where it grew.
026	EZE	017	011	Moreover, the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:
026	EZE	017	012	Say now to the rebellious house, Know ye not what these things mean? Say, behold, the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem, and took her king and her princes, and led them with him to Babylon,
026	EZE	017	013	and took one of the king's offspring, and made a covenant with him, and took an oath of him, and the mighty of the land he took away,
026	EZE	017	014	that the kingdom might be brought low, so as not to lift itself up; that the covenant might be kept, and stand.
026	EZE	017	015	But he rebelled against him, in sending his ambassadors into Egypt, that they might give him horses and much people. Shall he prosper? Shall he escape that doeth such things? Shall he break the covenant and be delivered?
026	EZE	017	016	As I live saith the Lord Jehovah, surely in the place where the king dwelleth that made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant he broke, even with him in the midst of Babylon shall he die.
026	EZE	017	017	Neither shall Pharaoh with his mighty army and great multitude accomplish anything for him in war, when they shall cast up mounds, and build forts to cut off many persons,
026	EZE	017	018	he hath despised the oath, and broken the covenant; behold, he hath given the hand, and yet done all these things; he shall not escape!
026	EZE	017	019	Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: As I live, surely mine oath, which he hath despised, and my covenant, which he hath broken, will I recompense upon his own head.
026	EZE	017	020	And I will spread my net upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare, and I will bring him to Babylon, and will contend with him there for his trespass which he hath committed against me.
026	EZE	017	021	And all his fugitives with all his hosts shall fall by the sword, and they that remain shall be scattered to all the winds; and ye shall know that I, Jehovah, have spoken it.
026	EZE	017	022	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I also will take from the top of the high cedar, and will get it; and from the highest of its twigs will I crop a tender one, and plant it upon a high and lofty mountain.
026	EZE	017	023	Upon a high mountain of Israel will I plant it, and it shall bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a goodly cedar; and under it shall dwell birds of every wing; in the shadow of its branches shall they dwell.
026	EZE	017	024	And all the trees of the field shall know that I, Jehovah, have brought down the high tree, and exalted the low tree; that I have dried up the green tree, and made the dry tree green. I, Jehovah, have spoken, and will do it.
026	EZE	018	001	The word of Jehovah came to me again, saying:
026	EZE	018	002	What mean ye, that ye use this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying, “The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge”?
026	EZE	018	003	As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, ye shall not have occasion any more to use this proverb in Israel.
026	EZE	018	004	Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son, is mine; the soul that sinneth, it shall die.
026	EZE	018	005	But if a man be just, and do that which is lawful and right;
026	EZE	018	006	if he eat not upon the mountains, and lift not up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, and defile not his neighbor's wife, and come not near a woman during her uncleanness;
026	EZE	018	007	if he oppress not any, if he restore to the debtor his pledge, spoil none by violence, give his bread to the hungry, and cover the naked with a garment;
026	EZE	018	008	if he give not forth upon usury, and take not increase; if he withdraw his hand from iniquity, and give true judgment between man and man;
026	EZE	018	009	if he walk in my statutes and keep my commandments, to deal uprightly, —he is just; he shall surely live, saith the Lord Jehovah.
026	EZE	018	010	But if he have a son that is a robber, a shedder of blood, and that doeth to his brother any of these things,
026	EZE	018	011	and doeth not all those duties, but eateth upon the mountains, and defileth his neighbor's wife,
026	EZE	018	012	oppresseth the poor and needy, spoileth by violence, restoreth not the pledge, lifteth up his eyes to idols, and committeth abomination,
026	EZE	018	013	giveth forth upon usury, and taketh increase, shall he live? No! he shall not live. He hath done all these abominations; he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon him.
026	EZE	018	014	Yet lo, if he have a son that seeth all the sins which his father committed, that seeth them and doeth not such like,
026	EZE	018	015	that eateth not upon the mountains, nor lifteth up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, nor defileth his neighbor's wife,
026	EZE	018	016	nor oppresseth any, nor taketh a pledge, nor spoileth by violence, but giveth his food to the hungry, and covereth the naked with a garment,
026	EZE	018	017	keepeth back his hand from the poor, and taketh no usury or increase, keepeth my commandments, and walketh in my statutes, he shall not die for the iniquity of his father; he shall surely live.
026	EZE	018	018	As for his father, because he cruelly oppressed, spoiled his brother by violence, and did that which is not good among his people, lo, he shall die for his iniquity.
026	EZE	018	019	Yet say ye, “Why? Doth not the son bear the iniquity of the father?” When the son doeth that which is lawful and right, keepeth all my statutes and doeth them, he shall surely live.
026	EZE	018	020	The soul that sinneth, it shall die. The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son. The righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.
026	EZE	018	021	But if the wicked will turn from all his sins which he hath committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die.
026	EZE	018	022	None of his transgressions which he hath committed shall be remembered unto him; for his righteousness, which he hath done, he shall live.
026	EZE	018	023	Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die, saith the Lord Jehovah, and not that he should turn from his ways and live?
026	EZE	018	024	But when the righteous turneth from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and doeth according to all the abominations which the wicked man doeth, shall he live? All his righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered; for his trespass which he hath trespassed, and for his sin which he hath sinned, for them shall he die.
026	EZE	018	025	Yet ye say, “The way of the Lord is not right.” Hear now, O house of Israel! “Is not my way right?” Is it not your ways that are not right?
026	EZE	018	026	When a righteous man turneth from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and on this account dieth, for his iniquity which he hath done doth he die.
026	EZE	018	027	And when the wicked man turneth from his iniquity which he hath committed, and doeth that which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive.
026	EZE	018	028	Because he considereth and turneth from all his transgressions which he hath committed, he shall surely live, he shall not die.
026	EZE	018	029	Yet saith the house of Israel, “The way of the Lord is not right.” O house of Israel, are not my ways right? Is it not your ways that are not right?
026	EZE	018	030	Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways, saith the Lord Jehovah. Turn ye, turn yourselves from all your transgressions, so that iniquity may not be your ruin.
026	EZE	018	031	Cast away from you all your transgressions which ye have committed, and make you a new heart, and a new spirit! For why will ye die, O house of Israel?
026	EZE	018	032	For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord Jehovah. Wherefore turn yourselves and live!
026	EZE	019	001	Moreover, take thou up a lamentation for the princes of Israel,
026	EZE	019	002	and say: —How lay thy mother at ease, a lioness among lions! Among young lions she nourished her whelps;
026	EZE	019	003	And she brought up one of her whelps; He became a young lion, And he learned to seize the prey; he devoured men.
026	EZE	019	004	And when the nations heard of him, he was taken in their pit, And they brought him with nose-rings to the land of Egypt.
026	EZE	019	005	And when she saw that she waited in vain, and that her hope was lost, She took another of her whelps, and she made him a young lion.
026	EZE	019	006	And he went up and down among the lions; he became a young lion, And he learned to seize the prey; he devoured men.
026	EZE	019	007	He knew their widows, and laid waste their cities, And the land was desolate, and all that was therein, before the voice of his roaring.
026	EZE	019	008	Then the nations set themselves against him on every side from the provinces, And spread their net over him; He was taken in their pit.
026	EZE	019	009	And they put him with nose rings into a cage, And carried him to the king of Babylon. And they carried him to a stronghold, That his voice might be heard no more Upon the mountains of Israel.
026	EZE	019	010	Thy mother was like a vine planted like thyself by the waters; She was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters;
026	EZE	019	011	She had strong rods for sceptres of rulers, And her stature was high among the thick branches, So that she was conspicuous in her height, And the multitude of her branches.
026	EZE	019	012	But she was plucked up in fury, She was cast down to the ground, And the east wind dried up her fruit. Her strong rods were broken and withered; The fire consumed them.
026	EZE	019	013	And now she is planted in the desert, In a dry and thirsty land.
026	EZE	019	014	And a fire is gone forth out of a rod of her branches, Which hath devoured her fruit, So that she hath no strong rod for a ruler's sceptre. This is a lamentation, and it shall be for a lamentation.
026	EZE	020	001	And it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth month, on the tenth day of the month, that certain of the elders of Israel came to inquire of Jehovah, and sat before me.
026	EZE	020	002	Then came the word of Jehovah to me, saying:
026	EZE	020	003	Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel, and say to them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Are ye come to inquire of me? As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, I will not be inquired of by you.
026	EZE	020	004	Punish them, punish them, son of man, cause them to know the abominations of their fathers, and say to them,
026	EZE	020	005	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: At the time when I chose Israel, I lifted up my hand to the race of the house of Jacob, and made myself known to them in the land of Egypt; I lifted up my hand to them, and said, I am Jehovah, your God.
026	EZE	020	006	At that time I lifted up my hand to them, that I would bring them forth out of the land of Egypt, into a land which I had looked out for them, flowing with milk and honey, the glory of all lands.
026	EZE	020	007	And I said to them, Cast ye away from you every one the abomination of his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt! I am Jehovah, your God.
026	EZE	020	008	But they rebelled against me, and would not hearken to me; they did not cast away every one the abominations of his eyes, neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt. Then I said that I would pour out my fury upon them, that I would accomplish mine anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.
026	EZE	020	009	But I acted for my name's sake, that it might not be polluted in the sight of the nations, in the midst of whom they were; and before their eyes I made myself known to them, in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt.
026	EZE	020	010	And I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, and led them into the wilderness.
026	EZE	020	011	And I gave them my statutes, and made known to them my laws, through which the man that keepeth them shall live.
026	EZE	020	012	Also I gave them my sabbaths, that they might be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I, Jehovah, sanctify them.
026	EZE	020	013	But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the desert; they walked not in my statutes, and they despised my laws, through which the man that keepeth them shall live, and my sabbaths they greatly polluted. Then I said that I would pour out my fury upon them in the desert, to consume them.
026	EZE	020	014	But I acted for my name's sake, that it might not be polluted before the nations, in whose sight I brought them forth.
026	EZE	020	015	Yet I lifted up my hand to them in the desert, that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them, flowing with milk and honey, the beauty of all lands;
026	EZE	020	016	because they despised my laws, and walked not in my statutes, but polluted my sabbaths; for their heart went after their idols.
026	EZE	020	017	Nevertheless mine eye spared them, so that I did not destroy them; neither did I make an end of them in the desert.
026	EZE	020	018	And I said to their sons in the desert, Walk ye not in the statutes of your fathers, neither observe their ordinances, nor defile yourselves with their idols!
026	EZE	020	019	I am Jehovah, your God; walk in my statutes, and keep my ordinances, and do them.
026	EZE	020	020	And hallow my sabbaths, that they may be a sign between me and you, that ye may know that I am Jehovah, your God.
026	EZE	020	021	But the sons rebelled against me; they walked not in my statutes, neither kept they my ordinances to do them, through which the man that doeth them shall live, and they polluted my sabbaths. Then I said that I would pour out my fury upon them, and accomplish mine anger upon them in the desert.
026	EZE	020	022	Nevertheless I held back my hand, and acted for my name's sake, that it should not be polluted before the nations, in whose sight I brought them forth.
026	EZE	020	023	I also lifted up my hand against them in the desert, that I would scatter them among the nations, and disperse them through the countries,
026	EZE	020	024	because they did not observe mine ordinances, but despised my statutes, and polluted my sabbaths, and their eyes were after the idols of their fathers.
026	EZE	020	025	Moreover I gave them statutes that were not good, and ordinances by which they should not live.
026	EZE	020	026	And I polluted them in their offerings, in that they caused every first-born child to pass through the fire, that I might destroy them, to the end that they might know that I am Jehovah.
026	EZE	020	027	Therefore speak to the house of Israel, O son of man, and say to them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Yet in this your fathers dishonored me, and trespassed against me.
026	EZE	020	028	For when I had brought them into the land concerning which I lifted up my hand, that I would give it to them, then they saw every high hill, and all the thick tree's, and there they offered their sacrifices, and there they presented their provoking oblation, and there they brought their sweet savor, and there they poured out their drink-offerings.
026	EZE	020	029	Then I said to them, What is the high place to which ye go? And it is called The High Place unto this day.
026	EZE	020	030	Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Are ye polluted after the manner of your fathers, and do ye commit fornication according to their abominations,
026	EZE	020	031	and by offering your gifts, and causing your sons to pass through the fire, —are ye polluted with all your idols even to this day, and shall I be inquired of by you, O house of Israel? As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, I will not be inquired of by you!
026	EZE	020	032	And that which cometh into your mind shall not come to pass, when ye say, “We will be as the nations, as the families of the countries, worshipping wood and stone.”
026	EZE	020	033	As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, surely with a mighty hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out will I rule over you.
026	EZE	020	034	And I will bring you forth from the nations, and gather you from the countries, wherein ye are scattered, with a mighty hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out.
026	EZE	020	035	And I will bring you into the desert of the nations, and there will I contend with you face to face.
026	EZE	020	036	Even as I contended with your fathers in the desert of the land of Egypt, so also will I contend with you, saith the Lord Jehovah.
026	EZE	020	037	And I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant.
026	EZE	020	038	And I will purge out from among you the rebels, and them that transgress against me; out of the country where they sojourn will I bring them forth, but they shall not enter into the land of Israel; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.
026	EZE	020	039	As for you, O house of Israel, thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Go ye, serve ye every one his idols in future also, if ye will not obey me! But pollute ye my holy name no more with your gifts and your idols!
026	EZE	020	040	For upon my holy mountain, upon the lofty mountain of Israel, there shall all the house of Israel, all that are in the land, serve me; there will I accept them, and there will I require your offerings, and the first fruits of your oblations, with all things which ye consecrate to me.
026	EZE	020	041	I will accept you as a sweet savor, when I bring you forth from the nations, and gather you from the countries, wherein ye have been scattered, and will through you be honored before the eyes of the nations.
026	EZE	020	042	And ye shall know that I am Jehovah, when I bring you into the land of Israel, into the country concerning which I lifted up my hand, that I would give it to your fathers.
026	EZE	020	043	And there shall ye remember your ways, and all your doings, wherein ye have been polluted; and ye shall loathe yourselves for all your evil deeds which ye have committed.
026	EZE	020	044	And ye shall know that I am Jehovah, when I deal with you for my name's sake, not according to your evil ways, nor according to your corrupt doings, O ye house of Israel, saith the Lord Jehovah.
026	EZE	020	045	And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:
026	EZE	020	046	Son of man, set thy face toward the south, and drop thy word against the South, and prophesy against the forest of the field in the South;
026	EZE	020	047	and say to the forest of the South, Hear the word of Jehovah! Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will kindle in thee a fire, which shall devour every green tree and every dry tree within thee; the fierce flame shall not be quenched, and all parts from the south to the north shall be burned therein.
026	EZE	020	048	And all flesh shall see that I, Jehovah, have kindled it; it shall not be quenched.
026	EZE	020	049	And I said, Ah, Lord Jehovah, they say of me, “Doth he not speak in parables?”
026	EZE	021	001	Then came the word of Jehovah to me, saying:
026	EZE	021	002	Son of man, set thy face toward Jerusalem, and drop thy word toward the holy places, and prophesy against the land of Israel,
026	EZE	021	003	and say to the land of Israel, Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I am against thee, and I will draw forth my sword out of its sheath, and will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked.
026	EZE	021	004	Seeing then that I cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked, therefore shall my sword go forth out of its sheath against all flesh from the south to the north.
026	EZE	021	005	And all flesh shall know that I, Jehovah, have drawn forth my sword out of its sheath; it shall not return any more.
026	EZE	021	006	Thou, therefore, O son of man, sigh! With the breaking of thy loins, and with bitterness, sigh before their eyes!
026	EZE	021	007	And when they shall say to thee, “Wherefore sighest thou?” thou shalt say, “For the rumor, because it cometh; and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be feeble, and every spirit shall fail, and all knees shall flow with water. Behold it cometh, it shall be brought to pass, saith the Lord Jehovah.”
026	EZE	021	008	Also the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:
026	EZE	021	009	Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith Jehovah: Say, The sword, the sword is sharpened and furbished.
026	EZE	021	010	It is sharpened, that it may make sore slaughter; it is furbished that it may glitter. Or shall we make mirth? The staff of my son despiseth every rod.
026	EZE	021	011	And he gave it to be furbished that it might be handled. The sword is sharpened and furbished, to be given into the hand of the slayer.
026	EZE	021	012	Cry and howl, son of man! for it cometh upon my people, upon all the princes of Israel. They are given up to the sword with my people. Therefore smite upon thy thigh.
026	EZE	021	013	The trial is made. And what if even the contemning staff should be no more? saith the Lord Jehovah.
026	EZE	021	014	Thou, therefore, son of man, prophesy, and smite thine hands together! for twice, yea thrice, cometh the sword, a sword of slaughter, a sword of great slaughter, that besetteth them on every side.
026	EZE	021	015	That their hearts may faint, and their overthrown may be multiplied, I have set the terror of the sword against all their gates. Ah, how is it made to glitter, polished for slaughter!
026	EZE	021	016	Unite thyself, smite to the right, prepare thyself, smite to the left, whithersoever thine edge is turned!
026	EZE	021	017	I also will smite my hands together, and cause mine anger to cease. I, Jehovah, have spoken it.
026	EZE	021	018	The word of Jehovah came to me again, saying:
026	EZE	021	019	Do thou, son of man, appoint thee two ways by which the sword of the king of Babylon may come; from one land shall both of them come; and choose thou a place, choose it at the head of the way to the city.
026	EZE	021	020	Appoint a way, that the sword may come towards Rabbath of the sons of Ammon, and towards Judah, to Jerusalem, the fenced city.
026	EZE	021	021	For the king of Babylon shall stand at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination; he shall shake together his arrows, he shall consult the teraphim, he shall look at the liver.
026	EZE	021	022	In his right hand shall be the lot: Jerusalem, to set battering-rams, to open the mouth with the war-cry, to lift up the voice in shouting, to set battering-rams against the gates, to cast up a mound, to build a tower.
026	EZE	021	023	And this shall appear a false divination in their sight, because they swore oaths to them. But he shall call to remembrance their iniquity, that they may be taken.
026	EZE	021	024	Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because ye make your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are discovered, so that in all your doings your sins do appear, —because, I say, ye bring yourselves into remembrance, ye shall be taken with that hand.
026	EZE	021	025	And thou, profane, wicked prince of Israel, whose day cometh in the time when iniquity bringeth destruction!
026	EZE	021	026	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will remove the diadem, and take away the crown! This shall no more be this. I exalt him that is low, and abase him that is high.
026	EZE	021	027	I will destroy, destroy, destroy it; and it shall be no more until he come to whom the right belongeth, and to whom I will give it.
026	EZE	021	028	And thou, son of man, prophesy, and say: Thus saith the Lord Jehovah concerning the sons of Ammon and their scorn; even say thou, The sword, the sword is drawn; to slay, to consume, is it furbished, so that it glittereth;
026	EZE	021	029	while they see deceit for thee, and prophesy falsehood, that it may bring thee to the necks of the wicked that are slain, whose day cometh in the time when iniquity bringeth destruction.
026	EZE	021	030	Return the sword into its sheath! In the place where thou wast created, in the land of thy nativity, I will judge thee,
026	EZE	021	031	and I will pour upon thee my indignation, I will blow upon thee in the fire of my wrath, and deliver thee into the hands of brutal men, skilful to destroy.
026	EZE	021	032	Thou shalt be fuel for the fire; thy blood shall be in the midst of the land; men shall no more remember thee. I, Jehovah, have spoken it.
026	EZE	022	001	And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:
026	EZE	022	002	Punish, punish, son of man, the city of blood, and show her all her abominations, and say,
026	EZE	022	003	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: O city that sheddest blood in the midst of thee, that thy time may come, and makest idols to defile thyself!
026	EZE	022	004	Through the blood which thou sheddest thou bringest guilt upon thyself, and through the idols which thou makest thou pollutest thyself, and thou causest thy days to draw near, and comest to thy years. Therefore do I make thee a reproach to the nations, and a derision to all countries.
026	EZE	022	005	Those that are near, and those that are far from thee, shall mock thee as infamous, full of confusion.
026	EZE	022	006	Behold the princes of Israel are engaged every one according to his strength within thee to shed blood.
026	EZE	022	007	In thee they set light by father and mother; in thee are they guilty of oppression to the stranger; in thee do they oppress the fatherless and the widow.
026	EZE	022	008	Thou hast despised my holy things, and profaned my sabbaths.
026	EZE	022	009	In thee are men who carry tales, that they may shed blood; in thee do they eat upon the mountains; in the midst of thee do they commit lewdness.
026	EZE	022	010	In thee doth the son uncover the father's nakedness; in thee do they lie with a woman in her uncleanness.
026	EZE	022	011	And one committeth abomination with his neighbor's wife; and another, with incestuous lewdness, defileth his daughter-in-law; and in thee another lieth with his sister, his father's daughter.
026	EZE	022	012	In thee do they take a reward to shed blood. Thou takest usury and increase, and thou hast enriched thyself from thy neighbor by extortion, and hast forgotten me, saith the Lord Jehovah.
026	EZE	022	013	Therefore, behold, I have smitten my hands together at thy dishonest gain which thou hast made, and at the blood which hath been shed in the midst of thee.
026	EZE	022	014	Can thy heart endure, or can thy hands be strong, in the day when I shall deal with thee? I, Jehovah, have spoken it, and will do it.
026	EZE	022	015	I will scatter thee among the nations, and disperse thee in the countries, and will consume thine impurity out of thee;
026	EZE	022	016	and thou shalt through thyself be profaned before the eyes of the nations, and thou shalt know that I am Jehovah.
026	EZE	022	017	And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:
026	EZE	022	018	Son of man, the house of Israel is become dross to me; all of them are brass, and tin, and iron, and lead, in the midst of the furnace; they are the dross of silver.
026	EZE	022	019	Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because ye are all of you become dross, therefore, behold, I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem.
026	EZE	022	020	As men gather silver, and brass, and iron, and lead, and tin, into the midst of the furnace, to blow the fire upon it, to melt it, so will I gather you in my anger and in my fury, and I will place you there and melt you.
026	EZE	022	021	Yea, I will gather you, and blow upon you with the fire of my wrath, and ye shall be melted in the midst thereof.
026	EZE	022	022	As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall ye be melted in the midst thereof; and ye shall know that I, Jehovah, have poured out my fury upon you.
026	EZE	022	023	And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:
026	EZE	022	024	Son of man, say to her, Thou art a land that is not cleansed, nor rained upon in the day of indignation.
026	EZE	022	025	There is a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst of her; like a roaring lion tearing the prey, they devour the lives of men; they take possession of treasures, and precious things, and make many widows in the midst of her.
026	EZE	022	026	Her priests violate my law, and profane my holy things. They make no distinction between the holy and profane, and show not the difference between the clean and the unclean; and they hide their eyes from my sabbaths, and I am profaned among them.
026	EZE	022	027	Her princes in the midst of her are like wolves tearing the prey. They shed blood, they destroy life, that they may get gain.
026	EZE	022	028	Her prophets daub for them with untempered mortar, seeing falsehood, and divining to them, saying, “Thus saith the Lord Jehovah,” when Jehovah hath not spoken.
026	EZE	022	029	The people of the land are guilty of oppression, and practise robbery, and distress the poor and needy; yea, they oppress the stranger, and have no justice.
026	EZE	022	030	I have sought for a man among them that should make a wall, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I might not destroy it; but I found none.
026	EZE	022	031	Therefore will I pour out my indignation upon them; I will consume them with the fire of my wrath; I will bring their way upon their heads, saith the Lord Jehovah.
026	EZE	023	001	The word of Jehovah came to me again, saying:
026	EZE	023	002	Son of man, there were two women, daughters of one mother;
026	EZE	023	003	and they committed fornication in Egypt; in their youth they committed fornication. There they allowed their breasts to be pressed, and their virgin teats to be handled.
026	EZE	023	004	Their names were Aholah, the elder, and Aholibah, her sister; and they became mine, and bore sons and daughters; as to their names, moreover, Aholah is Samaria, and Aholibah, Jerusalem.
026	EZE	023	005	And Aholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians, her neighbors
026	EZE	023	006	who were clothed with blue, captains and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen, riding on horses.
026	EZE	023	007	Thus she committed fornication with them, with all the choice young men of Assyria, and with all on whom she doted; with all their idols she defiled herself.
026	EZE	023	008	Neither forsook she her whoredoms brought from Egypt; for they lay with her in her youth, and handled the breasts of her virginity, and poured their fornication upon her.
026	EZE	023	009	Wherefore I delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted.
026	EZE	023	010	These uncovered her nakedness; they took her sons and her daughters, and slew her with the sword; and she became famous among women, when they had executed judgment upon her.
026	EZE	023	011	And her sister, Aholibah, saw this, but she was more corrupt in her inordinate love than she, and in her whoredoms more than her sister in her whoredoms.
026	EZE	023	012	She doted upon the Assyrians, her neighbors, prefects and rulers clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding upon horses, all of them desirable young men.
026	EZE	023	013	Then I saw that she was defiled; that they both took one way.
026	EZE	023	014	But she added to her whoredoms; for she saw men portrayed upon the wall, images of Chaldaeans portrayed with vermilion,
026	EZE	023	015	girded with girdles upon their loins, and having long mitres hanging down from their heads, in their appearance all of them princes, after the manner of the sons of Babylon, of Chaldaea, the land of their nativity;
026	EZE	023	016	and as soon as she cast her eyes upon them, she doted on them, and sent messengers to them into Chaldaea.
026	EZE	023	017	And the sons of Babylon came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their whoredoms, and she was polluted with them. She then became alienated from them.
026	EZE	023	018	So she discovered her fornications, and discovered her nakedness. Then my mind was alienated from her, as it had been alienated from her sister.
026	EZE	023	019	For she multiplied her whoredoms in calling to remembrance the days of her youth, wherein she played the harlot in the land of Egypt;
026	EZE	023	020	for she doted on their paramours, whose members were as the members of asses, and whose issue was as the issue of horses.
026	EZE	023	021	Thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth, when thy teats were handled by the Egyptians, on account of the paps of thy youth.
026	EZE	023	022	Therefore, O Aholibah, thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will raise up against thee thy lovers, from whom thou art alienated, and I will bring them against thee on every side,
026	EZE	023	023	the Babylonians and all the Chaldaeans, prefects, rich men, and nobles, and all the Assyrians with them, all of them desirable young men, prefects and rulers, captains and men of renown, all of them riding upon horses.
026	EZE	023	024	And they shall come against thee with arms, chariots and wheels, and with hosts of people; with buckler and shield and helmet shall they set themselves against thee on every side. And I will commit to them judgment, and they shall punish thee according to their punishments.
026	EZE	023	025	And I will set my jealousy against thee, and they shall deal with thee in fury; they shall take away thy nose and thine ears, and thy posterity shall fall by the sword. They shall take away thy sons and thy daughters, and thy posterity shall be consumed with fire.
026	EZE	023	026	They shall also strip thee of thy garments, and take away thy fair jewels.
026	EZE	023	027	Thus will I make thy lewdness to cease from thee, and thy whoredom brought from the land of Egypt, so that thou shalt not lift thine eyes to them, nor remember Egypt any more.
026	EZE	023	028	For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will deliver thee into the hand of them whom thou hatest, into the hand of them from whom thou art alienated.
026	EZE	023	029	And they shall deal with thee in hatred, and take away all the fruits of thy labor from thee, and shall leave thee naked and bare; and thy nakedness shall be uncovered, with which thou hast committed lewdness and fornication and foul whoredom.
026	EZE	023	030	These things will I do to thee, because thou hast committed whoredom with the nations, and hast been polluted with their idols.
026	EZE	023	031	Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister, therefore will I give her cup into thy hand.
026	EZE	023	032	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Thou shalt drink of thy sister's cup, which is deep and large; it shall make thee a laughing-stock and a derision, for it containeth much.
026	EZE	023	033	Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow. A cup of astonishment and amazement is the cup of thy sister Samaria.
026	EZE	023	034	Thou shalt even drink it and suck it out, and lick the sherds, and thou shalt tear thy breasts. For I have spoken it, saith the Lord Jehovah.
026	EZE	023	035	Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because thou hast forgotten me, and cast me behind thy back, therefore bear thou thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.
026	EZE	023	036	Moreover, Jehovah said to me, Son of man, punish Aholah and Aholibah; yea, declare to them their abominations;
026	EZE	023	037	that they have committed adultery, and blood is upon their hands, and that with their idols they have committed adultery, and have also caused their sons, whom they bore to me, to pass through the fire to them for food.
026	EZE	023	038	This also have they done to me: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my sabbaths.
026	EZE	023	039	For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came into my sanctuary the same day to profane it; behold, thus have they done in my house.
026	EZE	023	040	Yea, ye sent for men to come from afar; messengers were sent to them, and behold, they came; for them didst thou wash thyself, and paint thine eyes, and deck thyself with ornaments.
026	EZE	023	041	And thou didst seat thyself upon a stately bed before which a table was prepared, and thereon didst thou set my incense and my oil.
026	EZE	023	042	Also the voice of a multitude at ease was with her; and together with men from the common multitude were brought deep-drinkers from the desert, who put bracelets upon their hands, and beautiful crowns upon their heads.
026	EZE	023	043	Then said I concerning her that was worn out with adulteries, Will they now commit whoredoms with her, even with her?
026	EZE	023	044	They went in to her, as men go to a harlot; so went they in to Aholah and to Aholibah, the lewd women.
026	EZE	023	045	But righteous men shall judge them, as adulteresses are judged, and as women that shed blood are judged; for they are adulteresses, and blood is upon their hands.
026	EZE	023	046	For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will bring a great company against them, and will give them up to be harassed and spoiled,
026	EZE	023	047	and the company shall stone them with stones, and cut them in pieces with their swords; they shall slay their sons and their daughters, and burn their houses with fire.
026	EZE	023	048	Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women may take warning, and not follow them in their lewdness.
026	EZE	023	049	And they shall recompense your lewdness upon you, and ye shall bear the sins of your idols; that ye may know that I am the Lord Jehovah.
026	EZE	024	001	Moreover, the word of Jehovah came to me in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, and said:
026	EZE	024	002	Son of man, write the name of the day, even of this same day. The king of Babylon draweth near to Jerusalem this same day.
026	EZE	024	003	Utter a parable to the rebellious house, and say to them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Set on a caldron, set it on, and also pour water into it.
026	EZE	024	004	Gather the pieces thereof into it, even every good piece, the thigh and the shoulder; fill it with the choice bones.
026	EZE	024	005	Take the choice of the flock, and make under it a pile for the bones, and make it boil well, that the bones therein may be seethed.
026	EZE	024	006	Wherefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Woe to the city of blood, to the caldron in which is rust, and whose rust goeth not out of it! bring it out piece by piece; let no lot fall upon it.
026	EZE	024	007	For blood is in the midst of her; upon the bare rock hath she shed it; she poured it not upon the ground, that it might be covered with dust.
026	EZE	024	008	To cause fury and to take vengeance, I have set the blood shed by her upon the bare rock, that it might not be covered.
026	EZE	024	009	Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Woe to the city of blood! Now will I make the pile for fire great.
026	EZE	024	010	Heap on wood, kindle the fire, cook the flesh, put in spices, and let the bones be burned.
026	EZE	024	011	Then set it empty upon the coals, that its brass may be hot and may burn, and that its impurity may be dissolved in it, and its rust be consumed.
026	EZE	024	012	It hath wearied me with labors, yet its thick rust goeth not from it; its rust remaineth in the midst of the fire.
026	EZE	024	013	In thy filthiness is gross wickedness, because, when I would have cleansed thee, thou wouldst not be cleansed. Thou shalt not be cleansed from thy filthiness any more, till I have quieted my fury toward thee.
026	EZE	024	014	I, Jehovah, have spoken it; it shall come to pass, and I will do it. I will not go back, neither will I spare, neither will I repent. According to thy ways and according to thy doings shall they judge thee, saith the Lord Jehovah.
026	EZE	024	015	Also the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:
026	EZE	024	016	Son of man, behold, I take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with one blow; yet thou shalt not mourn, nor weep, nor shall thy tears run down.
026	EZE	024	017	Sigh thou in silence, make no mourning for the dead; bind thy head-dress upon thee, and thy shoes on thy feet; cover not thy lips, and eat not the bread of wretched men.
026	EZE	024	018	So I spake to the people in the morning, and my wife died in the evening; and I did in the morning as I was commanded.
026	EZE	024	019	And the people said to me, Wilt thou not tell us what those things which thou doest denote to us?
026	EZE	024	020	Then I answered them: The word of Jehovah came to me and said:
026	EZE	024	021	Say to the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the pride of your confidence, the desire of your eyes, and the longing of your souls; and your sons and daughters that are left to you shall fall by the sword.
026	EZE	024	022	And ye shall do as I have done; ye shall not cover your mouths, nor eat the bread of wretched men;
026	EZE	024	023	and your head-dresses shall be upon your heads, and your shoes upon your feet; ye shall not mourn nor weep; but ye shall pine away for your iniquities, and moan one to another.
026	EZE	024	024	Thus Ezekiel shall be to you a sign; according to all that he hath done shall ye do, when this cometh; and ye shall know that I am the Lord Jehovah.
026	EZE	024	025	And thou, son of man, behold, in the day when I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and the longing of their souls, their sons and their daughters, in that day shall one
026	EZE	024	026	that is escaped come to thee, to cause thee to hear it with thine ears.
026	EZE	024	027	In that day shall thy mouth be opened to him that is escaped, and thou shalt speak, and be no more dumb; and thou shalt be a sign to them, and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
026	EZE	025	001	The word of Jehovah came again to me, saying:
026	EZE	025	002	Son of man, set thy face against the Ammonites, and prophesy against them;
026	EZE	025	003	and say to the Ammonites, Hear the word of the Lord Jehovah! Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because thou saidst, “Aha!” against my sanctuary when it was profaned, and against the land of Israel when it was desolate, and against the house of Judah when they went into captivity, therefore,
026	EZE	025	004	behold, I will deliver thee to the sons of the East for a possession, and they shall set their folds in thee, and make their dwellings in thee; they shall eat thy fruit, and they shall drink thy milk.
026	EZE	025	005	And I will make Rabbah a stable for camels, and the land of the Ammonites a couching-place for flocks; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.
026	EZE	025	006	For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because thou hast clapped thy hands, and stamped with thy feet, and rejoiced with all thy despite from the heart, against the land of Israel,
026	EZE	025	007	therefore, behold, I will stretch out my hand upon thee, and will deliver thee for a spoil to the nations; I will cut thee off from the nations, and cause thee to perish from the countries; I will destroy thee; and thou shalt know that I am Jehovah.
026	EZE	025	008	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because Moab and Seir say, “Behold, the house of Judah is like all the nations,”
026	EZE	025	009	therefore, behold, I will open the side of Moab from his cities, which are on his borders, the glory of the country, Beth-jeshimoth, Baal-meon, and Kiriathaim.
026	EZE	025	010	To the sons of the East will I give it for a possession, together with the sons of Ammon, that the sons of Ammon may be no more remembered among the nations;
026	EZE	025	011	and on Moab will I execute judgments, and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
026	EZE	025	012	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because Edom hath dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and hath greatly offended, and revenged himself upon them,
026	EZE	025	013	therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will stretch out my hand upon Edom, and will cut off from it man and beast; and I will make it desolate from Teman; and unto Dedan shall they fall by the sword.
026	EZE	025	014	And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel; and they shall deal with Edom according to mine anger, and according to my fury; and they shall know my vengeance, saith the Lord Jehovah.
026	EZE	025	015	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because the Philistines have dealt with revenge, and have taken vengeance, with a despiteful heart, even to destruction, from the old hatred;
026	EZE	025	016	therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will stretch out my hand upon the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethites, and destroy the remnant upon the sea-coasts.
026	EZE	025	017	And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes; and they shall know that I am Jehovah when I lay my vengeance upon them.
026	EZE	026	001	And it came to pass in the eleventh year, on the first day of the month, that the word bf Jehovah came to me, saying:
026	EZE	026	002	Son of man, because Tyre hath said against Jerusalem, “Aha! she is broken that was the gate of the nations; now is all transferred to me; I shall be full, now that she is desolate!”
026	EZE	026	003	therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against thee, O Tyre, and I will cause many nations to come up against thee, as the sea causeth his waves to come up.
026	EZE	026	004	And they shall destroy the walls of Tyre, and break down her towers; and I will scrape off her earth from her, and make her like a naked rock.
026	EZE	026	005	She shall be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea; for I have spoken it, saith the Lord Jehovah. And she shall be to the nations for a spoil;
026	EZE	026	006	and her daughters that are upon the land shall be slain by the sword; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
026	EZE	026	007	For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will bring against Tyre Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, a king of kings from the North, with horses, and with chariots, and with horsemen, and a vast multitude of people.
026	EZE	026	008	Thy daughters upon the land shall he slay with the sword; and he shall set a tower against thee, and cast up a mound against thee, and lift up the buckler against thee;
026	EZE	026	009	and his battering-rams shall be set against thy walls, and thy towers shall he break down with axes.
026	EZE	026	010	By reason of the great number of his horses, their dust shall cover thee; thy walls shall shake at the noise of the horsemen, and of the wheels, and of the chariots, when he entereth into thy gates, as men enter into a city that is broken through.
026	EZE	026	011	With the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all thy streets; thy people he shall slay with the sword; and the idols of thy strength shall fall to the ground.
026	EZE	026	012	And they shall make a spoil of thy riches, and make a prey of thy merchandise; and they shall break down thy walls, and destroy thy beautiful houses; and thy stones and thy timber and thine earth shall they lay in the midst of the waters.
026	EZE	026	013	And I will cause the noise of thy songs to cease, and the sound of thy harps shall be no more heard.
026	EZE	026	014	And I will make thee like a naked rock; thou shalt be a place to spread nets upon; thou shalt be built no more; for I, Jehovah, have spoken it, saith the Lord Jehovah.
026	EZE	026	015	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah to Tyre: Behold, the isles shall shake at the sound of thy fall, at the groaning of the wounded, and at the slaughter which is made in the midst of thee.
026	EZE	026	016	And all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones, and lay aside their mantles, and put off their embroidered garments. They shall clothe themselves with trembling, and sit on the ground, and tremble every moment, and be astonished at thee.
026	EZE	026	017	And they shall utter a lamentation over thee, and say to thee, “How art thou destroyed, thou that wast peopled from the seas, the renowned city, that wast mighty upon the sea, thou and thine inhabitants, causing terror to all that dwelt near thee!”
026	EZE	026	018	Now shall the isles tremble in the day of thy fall; yea, the isles that are in the sea shall quake at thy departure.
026	EZE	026	019	For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: When I shall make thee a desolate city, like the cities that are not inhabited, when I shall bring up the deep upon thee, and great waters shall cover thee,
026	EZE	026	020	I will bring thee down to them that have gone down to the pit, to the people of old time, and I will cause thee to dwell in the lower parts of the earth, amid the ruins of ancient times, with them that have gone down to the pit, that thou be no more inhabited; but I will set glory in the land of the living.
026	EZE	026	021	I will make thee a desolation, and thou shalt be no more; though thou be sought for, thou shalt be found no more forever, saith the Lord Jehovah.
026	EZE	027	001	The word of Jehovah came again to me, saying:
026	EZE	027	002	Son of man, take up a lamentation over Tyre,
026	EZE	027	003	and say to Tyre, O thou that didst dwell at the entrance of the sea, the merchant of the nations to many coasts! thus saith the Lord Jehovah: O Tyre, thou hast said, “I am perfect in beauty.”
026	EZE	027	004	Thy borders are in the midst of the seas; thy builders have perfected thy beauty.
026	EZE	027	005	They made all thy ship-boards of cypresses of Senir; they took cedars from Lebanon to make masts for thee.
026	EZE	027	006	Of oaks of Bashan they made thine oars; thy benches they made of ivory inlaid in cedar from the coasts of the Chittaeans.
026	EZE	027	007	Fine linen with broidered work from Egypt was that which thou didst spread forth to be thy sail; blue and purple from the coasts of Elisha were thy covering.
026	EZE	027	008	The inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad were thy rowers; thy wise men, O Tyre, that were in thee, were thy pilots.
026	EZE	027	009	The ancients of Gebal and the skilful men thereof were in thee, thy calkers; all the ships of the sea, with their mariners, were in thee, to traffic in thy merchandise.
026	EZE	027	010	Persians, and Lydians, and Lybians were in thine army, thy men of war; they hung up the shield and helmet in thee; they set forth thy glory.
026	EZE	027	011	The men of Arvad and thine own army were upon thy walls round about, and brave warriors were in thy towers; they hung their shields upon thy walls round about; they made thy beauty perfect.
026	EZE	027	012	Tarshish trafficked with thee on account of the abundance of all kinds of goods; with silver, iron, tin, and lead they traded in thy fairs.
026	EZE	027	013	Javan, Tubal, and Meshech trafficked with thee; the persons of men and vessels of brass they sold in thy market.
026	EZE	027	014	They of the house of Togarmah traded in thy fairs with horses and horsemen and mules.
026	EZE	027	015	The men of Dedan trafficked with thee; many islands were at hand to thee for trade; they brought thee, for payment, horns of ivory, and ebony-wood.
026	EZE	027	016	Syria trafficked with thee by reason of the multitude of the wares of thy making; with carbuncles, purple and embroidered work, and fine linen, and corals, and rubies, they traded in thy fairs.
026	EZE	027	017	Judah and the land of Israel trafficked with thee; with wheat of Minnith, and pastry, and syrup, and oil, and balm they traded in thy market.
026	EZE	027	018	Damascus trafficked with thee on account of the multitude of the wares of thy making, on account of the abundance of all kinds of goods, in the wine of Helbon, and in white wool.
026	EZE	027	019	Vedan and Javan brought thread to thy market; wrought iron, cassia, and sweet reed were in thy fairs.
026	EZE	027	020	Dedan brought cloth for riding, in traffic with thee.
026	EZE	027	021	Arabia and all the princes of Kedar were at hand to traffic with thee; they traded with thee in lambs and rams and goats.
026	EZE	027	022	The merchants of Sheba and Raamah trafficked with thee with all kinds of precious spices, and with all kinds of precious stones, and gold.
026	EZE	027	023	Haran, and Canneh, and Eden, the merchants of Sheba, Assyria, and Chilmad,
026	EZE	027	024	trafficked with thee in splendid apparel, in mantles of blue and embroidered work, in chests of damask bound with cords and made of cedar, in thy market.
026	EZE	027	025	The ships of Tarshish were the caravans for thy traffic; and thou wast replenished and made very glorious in the midst of the seas.
026	EZE	027	026	Thy rowers have brought thee into great waters; the east wind hath broken thee in the midst of the seas.
026	EZE	027	027	Thy riches, and thy fairs, and thy merchandise, thy mariners, and thy pilots, thy calkers, and the traders in thy merchandise, and all thy men of war within thee, and all thy multitude that is in the midst of thee, shall fall into the midst of the seas in the day of thy ruin.
026	EZE	027	028	At the sound of the cry of thy pilots the pastures around thee shall shake.
026	EZE	027	029	And all that handle the oar, the mariners, and all the pilots of the sea, shall come down from their ships; they shall stand upon the land,
026	EZE	027	030	and shall cause their voice to be heard for thee, and shall cry bitterly, and shall cast dust upon their heads, and roll themselves in ashes.
026	EZE	027	031	And they shall make themselves utterly bald for thee, and gird themselves with sackcloth; and they shall weep for thee with bitterness of heart and bitter wailing.
026	EZE	027	032	And in their wailing they shall take up for thee a lamentation, and shall lament over thee, saying: “What city is like Tyre, like the Destroyed in the midst of the sea?
026	EZE	027	033	When thy wares went forth from the seas, thou didst satisfy many nations; thou didst enrich the kings of the earth with the abundance of thy riches and thy merchandise.
026	EZE	027	034	Now thou art broken by the seas in the depth of the waters, and thy merchandise and all thy multitude in the midst of thee are fallen.
026	EZE	027	035	All the inhabitants of the isles are astonished at thee, and their kings shudder; they are troubled in their countenance.
026	EZE	027	036	The merchants among the nations hiss at thee. Thou art a desolation, and shalt exist no more forever.”
026	EZE	028	001	The word of Jehovah came again to me, saying:
026	EZE	028	002	Son of man, say to the prince of Tyre, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because thy heart is lifted up, and thou hast said, “I am a god, I sit in the seat of a god, in the midst of the seas”; and though thou art man, not God, yet settest thy heart as the heart of a god, —
026	EZE	028	003	behold, thou art wiser than Daniel; there is no secret which can be hidden from thee;
026	EZE	028	004	by thy wisdom and by thine understanding thou hast gotten thee riches, and hast gotten gold and silver in thy treasures;
026	EZE	028	005	by thy great wisdom, by thy traffic, thou hast increased thy riches, and thy heart is lifted up because of thy wealth, —
026	EZE	028	006	therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because thou settest thy heart as the heart of a god, therefore,
026	EZE	028	007	behold, I will bring upon thee strangers, the terrible of the nations; and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of thy wisdom, and they shall defile thy brightness.
026	EZE	028	008	They shall bring thee down to the pit, and thou shalt die the death of the slain, in the midst of the seas.
026	EZE	028	009	Wilt thou yet say, “I am a god,” before him that slayeth thee? Thou shalt be man, and not God, in the hand of him that slayeth thee.
026	EZE	028	010	Thou shalt die the death of the uncircumcised, by the hand of strangers; for I have spoken it, saith the Lord Jehovah.
026	EZE	028	011	Moreover, the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:
026	EZE	028	012	Son of man, take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyre, and say to him, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: —Thou wast a finished signet, Full of wisdom and perfect in beauty;
026	EZE	028	013	In Eden, the garden of God, thou didst dwell; Every precious stone was thy covering, The ruby, the topaz, and the diamond, The chrysolite, the onyx, and the jasper, The sapphire, the carbuncle, and the emerald, and gold. The workmanship of thy jewel-holes was within thee; On the day when thou wast born were they prepared.
026	EZE	028	014	Thou wast an outspread, covering cherub; I set thee upon the holy mountain of God; Thou didst walk in the midst of the stones of fire.
026	EZE	028	015	Thou wast prosperous in thy ways from the day that thou wast born Until iniquity was found in thee.
026	EZE	028	016	Through the abundance of thy merchandise thou art full of injustice; And thou hast sinned; Therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God, And I will destroy thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire.
026	EZE	028	017	Thy heart was lifted up because of thy beauty; Thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy splendor; I will cast thee to the ground; I will give thee up to kings to be their gazing-stock.
026	EZE	028	018	By the multitude of thine iniquities, by the unrighteousness of thy traffic, Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries. Therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, which shall devour thee, And I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth, In the sight of all them that behold thee.
026	EZE	028	019	All they that know thee among the nations shall be astonished at thee; Thou art become a desolation, and shalt exist no more forever.
026	EZE	028	020	Again the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:
026	EZE	028	021	Son of man, set thy face against Sidon, and prophesy against her,
026	EZE	028	022	and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against thee, O Sidon, and I will be glorified in the midst of thee, and they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I execute judgments in her, and am sanctified in her.
026	EZE	028	023	I will send upon her pestilence, and blood into her streets, and the wounded shall fall in the midst of her by the sword which is against her on every side; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
026	EZE	028	024	And there shall be no more to the house of Israel a pricking brier, or a grieving thorn of all that are round about them, that despised them; and they shall know that I am the Lord Jehovah.
026	EZE	028	025	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: When I shall gather the house of Israel from the nations among which they are scattered, then shall I be sanctified through them in the sight of the nations, and they shall dwell in the land which I gave to my servant Jacob.
026	EZE	028	026	They shall dwell therein securely, and shall build houses, and plant vineyards, yea, they shall dwell securely when I have executed judgments on all that despised them round about; and they shall know that I am Jehovah, their God.
026	EZE	029	001	In the tenth year, in the tenth month, in the twelfth day of the month, the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:
026	EZE	029	002	Son of man, set thy face against Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and prophesy against him, and against all Egypt;
026	EZE	029	003	Speak, and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against thee, Pharaoh, king of Egypt, thou great dragon, that liest in the midst of thy rivers, and sayest, “My river is my own, and I have made it for myself.”
026	EZE	029	004	And I will put hooks in thy jaws, and I will cause the fish of thy rivers to cleave to thy scales, and I will draw thee forth from the midst of thy rivers, and all the fish of thy rivers which cleave to thy scales.
026	EZE	029	005	And I will cast thee into the desert, thee and all the fish of thy rivers; thou shalt fall upon the open fields; thou shalt not be brought together, nor gathered; to the beasts of the field and the birds of heaven I have given thee for food.
026	EZE	029	006	And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am Jehovah; because they have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel.
026	EZE	029	007	When they took hold of thee by thy handle, thou didst break and pierce their whole shoulder; and when they leaned upon thee, thou didst go to pieces, and madest all their loins to shake.
026	EZE	029	008	Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will bring a sword upon thee, and cut off man and beast out of thee;
026	EZE	029	009	and the land of Egypt shall be desolate and waste; and they shall know that I am Jehovah, because he hath said, “The river is mine, and I have made it.”
026	EZE	029	010	Therefore, behold, I am against thee, and against thy rivers; and I will make the land of Egypt utterly waste and desolate, from Migdol even to Syene, and to the borders of Ethiopia.
026	EZE	029	011	There shall not pass through it the foot of man, and the foot of beast shall not pass through it, neither shall it be inhabited forty years.
026	EZE	029	012	I will make the land of Egypt desolate amidst the lands that are desolate, and her cities, among the cities that are laid waste, shall be desolate forty years; and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.
026	EZE	029	013	Yet thus saith the Lord Jehovah: At the end of forty years will I gather the Egyptians from the nations whither they are scattered;
026	EZE	029	014	and I will bring back the captives of Egypt, and will cause them to return into the land of Pathros, into the land of their origin; and they shall be there a mean kingdom;
026	EZE	029	015	it shall be the meanest of all kingdoms; it shall no more exalt itself above the nations; for I will diminish them, that they shall no more rule over the nations.
026	EZE	029	016	And it shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel, bringing to my remembrance their iniquity in looking to them for help; and they shall know that I am the Lord Jehovah.
026	EZE	029	017	And it came to pass in the twenty-seventh year, in the first month, on the first day of the month, that the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:
026	EZE	029	018	Son of man, Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, caused his army to serve a great service against Tyre; every head was made bald, and every shoulder was peeled; yet neither he nor his army had wages from Tyre for the service which he served against it.
026	EZE	029	019	Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will give the land of Egypt to Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, and he shall take her multitude, and take her spoil, and take her plunder; and it shall be wages for his army.
026	EZE	029	020	For his wages for his service I will give him the land of Egypt; for they wrought for me, saith the Lord Jehovah.
026	EZE	029	021	In that day will I cause a horn to grow forth to the house of Israel, and I will give thee to open the mouth in the midst of them; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
026	EZE	030	001	The word of Jehovah came again to me, saying:
026	EZE	030	002	Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Howl ye, Alas! alas for the day!
026	EZE	030	003	For the day is near, the day of Jehovah is near! A day of clouds, the time of the nations is come.
026	EZE	030	004	The sword shall come upon Egypt, and anguish shall be in Ethiopia, when the slain shall fall in Egypt, and they shall take away her multitude, and her foundations shall be destroyed.
026	EZE	030	005	Ethiopia, and Lybia, and Lydia, and all her auxiliaries, and Chub, and the men of every country that is in league, shall fall with them by the sword.
026	EZE	030	006	Thus saith Jehovah: They that uphold Egypt shall fall, and the pride of her power shall come down; from Migdol to Syene shall they fall in her by the sword, saith the Lord Jehovah.
026	EZE	030	007	And they shall be laid waste in the midst of the lands that are laid waste, and her cities shall be amongst the cities that are desolate.
026	EZE	030	008	And they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I have brought a fire into Egypt, and all her helpers shall be destroyed.
026	EZE	030	009	In that day shall messengers go forth from me in ships, to make the confident Ethiopians afraid; and anguish shall come upon them, as in the day of Egypt; for behold, it cometh!
026	EZE	030	010	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will make the multitude of Egypt to cease by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon.
026	EZE	030	011	He and his people with him, the terrible of the nations, shall be brought to make the land desolate; and they shall draw their swords against Egypt, and fill the land with the slain.
026	EZE	030	012	And I will make the rivers dry, and I will sell the land into the hand of evil men; and I will lay waste the land and all that is therein, by the hand of strangers; I, Jehovah, have spoken it.
026	EZE	030	013	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will destroy the idols, and cause the images to cease out of Noph; and there shall be no more a prince of the land of Egypt; and I will bring fear upon the land of Egypt:
026	EZE	030	014	And I will lay waste Pathros, and bring a fire upon Zoan, and execute judgments upon No.
026	EZE	030	015	And I will pour out my fury upon Sin, the strength of Egypt, and I will cut off the multitude of No.
026	EZE	030	016	And I will bring a fire upon Egypt; Sin shall tremble, and No shall be broken through, and Noph shall be plundered by day.
026	EZE	030	017	The young men of On and of Pibeseth shall fall by the sword, and the women shall go into captivity.
026	EZE	030	018	At Tahpanhes also the day shall be darkened, when I shall break there the yoke of Egypt, and the pride of her strength shall cease within her. A cloud shall cover her, and her daughters shall go into captivity.
026	EZE	030	019	Thus will I execute judgments upon Egypt; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
026	EZE	030	020	Now it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first month, on the seventh day of the month, that the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:
026	EZE	030	021	Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and lo, it is not bound up, so as to have medicines applied to it; a bandage is not applied to it, to make it strong to hold the sword.
026	EZE	030	022	Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against Pharaoh, the king of Egypt; and I will break his arms, both the strong one, and that which was broken, and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand.
026	EZE	030	023	And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse them through the countries.
026	EZE	030	024	But I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and will put my sword into his hand, and break the arms of Pharaoh, so that he shall groan before him with the groanings of a deadly wounded man.
026	EZE	030	025	Yea, I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and the arms of Pharaoh shall fall down; and they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I shall put my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall stretch it out upon the land of Egypt.
026	EZE	030	026	And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse them among the countries, and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
026	EZE	031	001	Now it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the third month, on the first day of the month, that the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:
026	EZE	031	002	Son of man, say to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and to his multitude: To whom art thou like in thy greatness?
026	EZE	031	003	Behold, the Assyrian was a cedar upon Lebanon, with fair branches; An overshadowing thicket, high of stature; And his top was among thick boughs.
026	EZE	031	004	The waters made him great; the deep waters made him high; Their streams went around their plantation, And sent forth their channels to all the trees of the field.
026	EZE	031	005	Therefore his height was exalted Above all the trees of the field. And his boughs were multiplied, and his branches became long, Because of the abundance of water when he shot forth.
026	EZE	031	006	In his boughs all the birds of heaven made their nests, And under his branches all the beasts of the field brought forth their young; And under his shadow dwelt all the great nations.
026	EZE	031	007	Thus was he beautiful in his greatness, in the length of his branches; For his root was by many waters.
026	EZE	031	008	The cedars in the garden of God could not hide him; The cypress-trees were not like his boughs, And the plane-trees were not like his branches. Not any tree in the garden of God Was like to him in his beauty.
026	EZE	031	009	I made him beautiful in the multitude of his branches, So that all the trees of Eden, which were in the garden of God, envied him.
026	EZE	031	010	Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because he lifted himself up in stature, And shot up his top among the thick boughs, And his heart was lifted up on account of his height,
026	EZE	031	011	Therefore I delivered him into the hand of the mighty one of the nations, To deal hardly with him; I drave him out for his wickedness;
026	EZE	031	012	And strangers, the terrible of the nations, cut him off and cast him away. Upon the mountains and in all the valleys his branches fell; And his boughs were broken in all the valleys of the land. And all the nations of the earth withdrew from his shadow and left him;
026	EZE	031	013	Upon his ruin dwelt all the birds of the heavens, And upon his branches were all the beasts of the forest.
026	EZE	031	014	To the end that none of all the trees by the waters Might exalt themselves for their stature, Nor shoot up their top among the thick boughs, And that none of the trees that drink water should cleave to them on account of their height; For all of them are delivered to death, to the lower parts of the earth, In the midst of the sons of men, To them that have gone down to the pit.
026	EZE	031	015	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: In the day when he went down to the grave, I caused the deep to mourn, I covered it for him; I restrained on account of him the streams, and the great waters were kept back; And I caused Lebanon to mourn for him, And all the trees of the field fainted for him.
026	EZE	031	016	At the sound of his fall I made the nations to shake, When I cast him down to the grave, To them that have gone down to the pit; And all the trees of Eden, The choice and best of Lebanon, Even all that drink water, Were comforted in the lower parts of the earth.
026	EZE	031	017	They also went down into the grave with him, To them that have been slain with the sword; They also that were his arm, That dwelt under his shadow among the nations.
026	EZE	031	018	To whom art thou thus like in glory and greatness among the trees of Eden? Thou shalt be brought down with the trees of Eden To the lower parts of the earth; Thou shalt lie down in the midst of the uncircumcised, With them that are slain by the sword. Thus shall it be with Pharaoh and all his multitude, Saith the Lord Jehovah.
026	EZE	032	001	And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, on the first day of the month, that the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:
026	EZE	032	002	Son of man, take up a lamentation over Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and say to him: —Thou art like a young lion among the nations; Thou art like a dragon in the seas; And thou camest forth into thy rivers, And troubledst the waters with thy feet, And didst disturb their rivers.
026	EZE	032	003	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will therefore spread my net over thee, Amidst an assembly of many nations; And they shall draw thee up in my net.
026	EZE	032	004	And I will throw thee upon the land, I will cast thee forth upon the open field, And I will cause all the birds of heaven to remain upon thee. And I will fill the beasts of the whole earth with thee;
026	EZE	032	005	And I will lay thy flesh upon the mountains, And fill the valleys with thy heaps.
026	EZE	032	006	And I will water the land in which thou swimmest with thy blood, even to the mountains, And the streams shall be full of thee.
026	EZE	032	007	And I will cover the heavens, when I quench thee, And make the stars thereof dark; I will cover the sun with a cloud, And the moon shall not give her light.
026	EZE	032	008	All the bright lights of heaven will I make dark over thee, And bring darkness upon thy land, Saith the Lord Jehovah.
026	EZE	032	009	And I will grieve the hearts of many nations, When I bring thy destruction among the nations, In lands which thou knowest not.
026	EZE	032	010	Yea, I will make many people amazed at thee, And their kings shall shudder on account of thee, When I brandish my sword before them; And they shall tremble every moment, every one for his life, in the day of thy fall.
026	EZE	032	011	For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: The sword of the king of Babylon shall come upon thee;
026	EZE	032	012	By the swords of the mighty will I cause thy multitude to fall, All of them the terrible of the nations. And they shall bring to nothing the pride of Egypt, And all her multitude shall be destroyed.
026	EZE	032	013	I will also destroy all her beasts From beside the great waters; Neither shall the foot of man trouble them any more, Nor shall the hoofs of beasts trouble them.
026	EZE	032	014	Then will I make their waters clear, And cause their rivers to run like oil, Saith the Lord Jehovah,
026	EZE	032	015	When I shall make the land of Egypt desolate, And the country shall be destitute of all that was therein, When I shall smite all that dwell therein, That they may know that I am Jehovah.
026	EZE	032	016	This is the lamentation which they shall utter; the daughters of the nations shall utter it. For Egypt and for all her multitude shall they utter it, saith the Lord Jehovah.
026	EZE	032	017	It came to pass also in the twelfth year, [[in the twelfth month, ]] on the fifteenth day of the month, that the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:
026	EZE	032	018	Son of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt, and cast her down, even her and the daughters of the famous nations, to the lower parts of the earth, to them that have gone down to the pit.
026	EZE	032	019	Art thou more beautiful than another? Come down and be laid with the uncircumcised!
026	EZE	032	020	They shall fall in the midst of them that are slain by the sword. The sword is given; drag her away and all her multitudes!
026	EZE	032	021	The mightiest heroes from the midst of the pit shall speak to him and his helpers; For they are gone down, they lie uncircumcised, slain by the sword.
026	EZE	032	022	There is Assyria and all her company; Her graves are round about her; All of them are slain, fallen by the sword;
026	EZE	032	023	Her grave is made in the depths of the pit, And her company is round about her grave, All of them slain, fallen by the sword, They who caused terror in the land of the living.
026	EZE	032	024	There is Elam and all her company round about her grave, All of them slain, fallen by the sword; They are gone down uncircumcised to the lower parts of the earth, Who caused terror in the land of the living; They bear their shame with them that have gone down to the pit.
026	EZE	032	025	Among the slain have they set her a bed with all her multitude; Her graves are round about her, All of them slain, uncircumcised, by the sword. Though they caused terror in the land of the living, Yet they bear their shame with them that have gone down to the pit; They are laid in the midst of the slain.
026	EZE	032	026	There is Meshech, Tubal, and all their multitude; Their graves are around them; All of them slain, uncircumcised, by the sword, Though they caused terror in the land of the living.
026	EZE	032	027	Shall they not lie with the mighty of the uncircumcised that are fallen, Who have gone down to the pit with their weapons of war, Having their swords laid under their heads, And their iniquity resting upon their bones, Though they were the terror of the mighty in the land of the living?
026	EZE	032	028	And thou also shalt be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised, And shalt lie down with them that are slain by the sword.
026	EZE	032	029	There is Edom, her kings and all her princes, Who in their might are laid with them that are slain by the sword; They lie down with the uncircumcised, With them that have gone down to the pit.
026	EZE	032	030	There are the princes of the North, All of them, and all the Sidonians, Who have gone down to the slain; In the midst of the terror of their might they are put to shame; They lie down uncircumcised with them that are slain by the sword, And bear their shame with them that have gone down to the pit.
026	EZE	032	031	Pharaoh shall see them, And shall comfort himself over all his multitude; Even Pharaoh and all his army are slain by the sword, Saith the Lord Jehovah.
026	EZE	032	032	Though I suffered him to spread terror in the land of the living, Yet is he laid in the midst of the uncircumcised, With them that are slain by the sword, Even Pharaoh and all his multitude, Saith the Lord Jehovah.
026	EZE	033	001	Again the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:
026	EZE	033	002	Son of man, speak to the children of thy people, and say to them, When I bring the sword upon a land, and the people of the land take a man out of their whole number, and set him for their watchman,
026	EZE	033	003	and he seeth the sword coming on the land, and bloweth the trumpet, and warneth the people,
026	EZE	033	004	then whoever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh not warning, and the sword cometh and taketh him away, his blood shall be upon his own head.
026	EZE	033	005	He heard the sound of the trumpet, and took not warning. His blood shall be upon him. But he that taketh warning shall save his life.
026	EZE	033	006	But if the watchman see the sword coming, and blow not the trumpet, and the people be not warned, and the sword come and take away any person from among them, he is taken away for his iniquity, but his blood will I require at the watchman's hand.
026	EZE	033	007	So thou, son of man, I have set thee a watchman to the house of Israel, that thou shouldst hear the word from my mouth, and warn them from me.
026	EZE	033	008	When I say to the wicked, “O wicked man, thou shalt surely die!” and thou speakest not to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die for his iniquity, but his blood will I require at thy hand.
026	EZE	033	009	Yet if thou warn the wicked of his way, to turn from it, and he turneth not from his way, he shall die for his iniquity, but thou hast delivered thyself.
026	EZE	033	010	Thou, therefore, O son of man, say to the house of Israel: Rightly do ye say, “Our transgressions and our sins are upon us, and through them we pine away. How then can we live?”
026	EZE	033	011	Say to them, As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live; turn ye, turn ye, from your evil ways! for why will ye die, O house of Israel?
026	EZE	033	012	Thou also, son of man, say to the sons of thy people, The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression; and through his wickedness shall not the wicked man fall in the day when he turneth from his wickedness; neither shall the righteous be able to live in the day when he sinneth.
026	EZE	033	013	When I say concerning the righteous, “He shall surely live,” and he trusteth in his righteousness, and doeth iniquity, all his righteousness shall not be remembered, but for his iniquity which he hath committed shall he die.
026	EZE	033	014	Again, when I say concerning the wicked, “He shall surely die,” and he turneth from his sin, and doeth that which is just and right,
026	EZE	033	015	and the wicked restoreth the pledge, giveth back that which he hath taken by violence, and walketh in the statutes of life without committing iniquity, he shall surely live, he shall not die.
026	EZE	033	016	None of his sins which he hath committed shall be mentioned to him; he hath done that which is just and right; he shall surely live.
026	EZE	033	017	And yet the sons of thy people say, “The way of the Lord is not right!” But it is their way which is not right.
026	EZE	033	018	When the righteous man turneth from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, he dieth because of it.
026	EZE	033	019	And when the wicked turneth from his wickedness, and doeth that which is just and right, he shall live thereby.
026	EZE	033	020	And yet ye say, “The way of the Lord is not right!” O house of Israel, I will judge you every one according to his ways!
026	EZE	033	021	And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth month, on the fifth day of the month, that one who had escaped from Jerusalem came to me, saying, “The city is smitten!”
026	EZE	033	022	Now the hand of Jehovah had been upon me in the evening before he that had escaped came; and he opened my mouth, until he came to me in the morning; he opened my mouth, so that I was no longer dumb.
026	EZE	033	023	And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:
026	EZE	033	024	Son of man, they that inhabit those wastes in the land of Israel say, “Abraham was but one, and he inherited the land; but we are many; to us is the land given for an inheritance.”
026	EZE	033	025	Therefore say to them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Ye eat with the blood, and life up your eyes to your idols, and shed blood; and shall ye possess the land?
026	EZE	033	026	Ye trust to your swords, ye commit abomination, and ye defile, every one, his neighbor's wife; and shall ye possess the land?
026	EZE	033	027	Say thou thus to them: Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: As I live, surely they that are in the wastes shall fall by the sword, and him that is in the open country will I give to the beasts to be devoured, and they that are in the forts and caves shall fall by the pestilence.
026	EZE	033	028	And I will make the land an utter desolation; and the pride of her strength shall cease; and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate, so that none shall pass through.
026	EZE	033	029	Then shall they know that I am Jehovah, when I have made the land an utter desolation, on account of all the abominations which they practise.
026	EZE	033	030	As for thee, O son of man, the sons of thy people speak concerning thee by the walls, and in the doors of houses; and speak one to another, every man to his neighbor, saying, “Come, I pray you, and hear what is the word that goeth forth from Jehovah.”
026	EZE	033	031	And they come to thee, as the people assembleth, and they sit before thee, as my people, and they hear thy words: but will not do them; for with their mouth they do what is lovely, but their heart goeth after gain.
026	EZE	033	032	And behold, thou art to them as a very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice, and can play well on an instrument; for they hear thy words, but do them not.
026	EZE	033	033	But when this cometh to pass, (and behold, it shall come to pass, ) then shall they know that a prophet hath been among them.
026	EZE	034	001	And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:
026	EZE	034	002	Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel; prophesy, and say to them, to the shepherds, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Woe to the shepherds of Israel, who feed themselves! Should not the shepherds feed the flocks?
026	EZE	034	003	Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the wool, ye kill that which is fatted; but ye feed not the flock.
026	EZE	034	004	The weak do ye not strengthen, and the sick do ye not heal, and the wounded do ye not bind up; ye bring not back that which hath been driven away, neither seek ye that which hath been lost; but with force and with cruelty do ye rule them.
026	EZE	034	005	Therefore are they scattered abroad, because there is no shepherd, and they are food to all the beasts of the field, or are scattered abroad.
026	EZE	034	006	My sheep wander through all the mountains, and upon every high hill; yea, over the whole face of the land is my flock scattered, and none careth for them, or seeketh them.
026	EZE	034	007	Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of Jehovah:
026	EZE	034	008	As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, surely, because my flock is become a prey, and my flock is become meat to all the beasts of the field because there is no shepherd, and because my shepherds search not for my flock, and feed themselves, and feed not my flock, —
026	EZE	034	009	therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of Jehovah.
026	EZE	034	010	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against the shepherds, and I will require my flock at their hand, and cause them to cease from feeding the flock; neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any more; for I will deliver my flock from their mouth, and they shall not be meat for them.
026	EZE	034	011	For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold I, even I, will seek my flock, and look after them;
026	EZE	034	012	as a shepherd looketh after his flock in the day when he is among his sheep that are scattered, so will I look after my sheep, and will deliver them out of all the places where they have been scattered in the day of clouds and darkness.
026	EZE	034	013	And I will bring them out from the nations, and gather them from the countries; and I will bring them to their own land, and feed them upon the mountains of Israel, in the valleys, and in all the dwelling-places of the land.
026	EZE	034	014	I will feed them in a good pasture, and upon the high mountains of Israel shall their fold be; there shall they lie down in a good fold, and in a fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of Israel.
026	EZE	034	015	I will feed my flock, and I will cause them to lie down, saith the Lord Jehovah.
026	EZE	034	016	I will seek that which was lost, and bring back that which was driven away, and will bind up that which was broken, and will strengthen the sick; but the fat and the strong will I destroy; I will feed them as they deserve.
026	EZE	034	017	And as for you, O my sheep, thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will judge between the weak of the flock and the strong ones, even the rams and the he-goats.
026	EZE	034	018	Seemeth it a small thing to you to eat up the good pasture, but ye must tread down with your feet the residue of your pastures? and to drink of the clear waters, but ye must foul the residue with your feet?
026	EZE	034	019	and that my sheep eat that which ye have trodden with your feet, and drink that which ye have fouled with your feet?
026	EZE	034	020	Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah to them: Behold I, even I, will judge between the fat and the lean of the flock.
026	EZE	034	021	Because ye thrust with your side and with your shoulder, and push all the weak with your horns, till ye scatter them abroad,
026	EZE	034	022	therefore will I save my sheep, and they shall no more be a prey; and I will judge between sheep and sheep.
026	EZE	034	023	And I will raise up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, even my servant David; he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd.
026	EZE	034	024	And I, Jehovah, will be their God, and my servant David a prince among them. I, Jehovah, have spoken it.
026	EZE	034	025	And I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause evil beasts to cease out of the land, so that they shall dwell safely in the desert, and sleep in the woods.
026	EZE	034	026	And I will make them, and the places round about my hill, a blessing; and I will cause the shower to come down in its season; showers rich in blessings shall there be.
026	EZE	034	027	And the tree of the field shall yield her fruit, and the earth shall yield her increase; and they shall be secure in their land, and shall know that I am Jehovah, when I shall break the bands of their yoke and deliver them out of the hand of them that made them servants.
026	EZE	034	028	And they shall no more be a prey to the nations, neither shall the beasts of the land devour them; but they shall dwell in security, and none shall make them afraid.
026	EZE	034	029	And I will raise up for them a plantation for my glory; and they shall no more be consumed with hunger in the land, neither shall they bear the reproach of the nations any more.
026	EZE	034	030	Then shall they know, that I, Jehovah, their God, am with them, and that they, the house of Israel, are my people, saith the Lord Jehovah.
026	EZE	034	031	For ye, my flock, the flock of my pasture, are men, and I am your God, saith the Lord Jehovah.
026	EZE	035	001	Moreover, the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:
026	EZE	035	002	Son of man, set thy face against Mount Seir, and prophesy against it,
026	EZE	035	003	and say to it, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against thee, O Mount Seir, and I will stretch out my hand against thee, and I will make thee an utter desolation;
026	EZE	035	004	I will lay thy cities waste, and thou shalt be desolate, and thou shalt know that I am Jehovah.
026	EZE	035	005	Because thou bearest a perpetual hatred, and deliverest up the sons of Israel to the sword in the time of their calamity, in the time when iniquity bringeth destruction:
026	EZE	035	006	therefore, as I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, surely, to blood will I bring thee, and blood shall pursue thee; since thou hast not hated blood, blood shall pursue thee.
026	EZE	035	007	Thus will I make Mount Seir an utter desolation, and cut off from it him that passeth out, and him that returneth.
026	EZE	035	008	And I will fill his valleys with the slain. Upon thy hills and in thy plains and in thy valleys shall fall they that are slain with the sword.
026	EZE	035	009	I will make thee a perpetual desolation, and thy cities shall not be inhabited; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.
026	EZE	035	010	Because thou hast said, “These two nations and these two countries shall be mine, and we shall possess them,” whereas Jehovah was there;
026	EZE	035	011	therefore, as I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, I will do according to thine anger and according to thine envy which in thy hatred against them thou hast practised, and I will make myself known to them when I judge thee.
026	EZE	035	012	And thou shalt know that I am Jehovah, and that I have heard all thy blasphemies which thou hast spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying: “They are laid desolate; to us are they given to be devoured.”
026	EZE	035	013	Thus with your mouth have ye magnified yourselves against me, and multiplied your words against me; I have heard them.
026	EZE	035	014	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: When the whole land rejoiceth, I will prepare desolation for thee.
026	EZE	035	015	As thou didst rejoice over my inheritance, the house of Israel, because it was desolate, so will I do to thee! Mount Seir shall be desolate, and all Edom, even all of it; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
026	EZE	036	001	Also, thou son of man, prophesy to the mountains of Israel, and say: Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of Jehovah.
026	EZE	036	002	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because the enemy hath said concerning you, “Aha! the everlasting heights have become our possession”;
026	EZE	036	003	therefore prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because, yea, because they have made you desolate, and swallowed you up on every side, so that ye have become a possession to the residue of the nations, and a subject for the lips of talkers, and a derision to the people;
026	EZE	036	004	therefore, ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord Jehovah. Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, to the mountains and the hills, the valleys and the plain, to the desolate wastes and to the forsaken cities, which are become a prey and a derision to the residue of the nations which are round about, —
026	EZE	036	005	therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Surely in the fire of my jealousy have I spoken against the residue of the nations, and against all Edom, who have allotted my land to themselves for a possession, with joy of their whole heart, and with a despiteful mind, to cast it out for a prey.
026	EZE	036	006	Prophesy, therefore, concerning the land of Israel, and say to the mountains and to the hills, to the valleys and the plains, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I have spoken in my jealousy and in my fury, because ye have borne the reproach of the nations.
026	EZE	036	007	Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I have lifted up my hand, that the nations that are round about you, that they shall bear their reproach.
026	EZE	036	008	But ye, O mountains of Israel, shall shoot forth your branches, and bear your fruit for my people Israel; for they are near coming.
026	EZE	036	009	For behold, I am for you, and I will turn to you, and ye shall be tilled and sown;
026	EZE	036	010	and I will multiply men upon you, even all the house of Israel, all of it; and the cities shall be inhabited, and the waste places shall be built.
026	EZE	036	011	I will multiply men upon you, and beasts; and they shall increase and be fruitful; and I will cause you to be inhabited as of old, and will do better to you than in the ancient time; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.
026	EZE	036	012	Yea, I will cause men, even my people Israel, to walk upon you, and they shall possess thee, and thou shalt be their inheritance, and thou shalt no more henceforth bereave them of children.
026	EZE	036	013	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because they say of you, “Thou hast devoured men, and made thy people childless!”
026	EZE	036	014	therefore thou shalt devour men no more, and no more make thy people childless, saith the Lord Jehovah.
026	EZE	036	015	Neither will I cause the reproach of the nations to be heard against thee any more, neither shalt thou bear the derision of the nations any more, neither shalt thou make thy nation childless any more, saith the lord Jehovah.
026	EZE	036	016	Moreover, the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:
026	EZE	036	017	Son of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land, they defiled it by their way and by their doings; their way before me was as the impurity of an unclean woman.
026	EZE	036	018	Wherefore I poured my fury upon them for the blood which they had shed in the land, and because they had polluted it with their idols.
026	EZE	036	019	And I scattered them among the nations, and they were dispersed through the countries; according to their way and according to their doings I judged them.
026	EZE	036	020	And when they came to the nations whither they went, they polluted my holy name, in that it was said of them, “These are the people of Jehovah, and they are gone forth out of his land.”
026	EZE	036	021	Therefore I will have regard to my holy name, which the house of Israel have polluted among the nations whither they are gone.
026	EZE	036	022	Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Not for your own sakes do I this, O house of Israel, but for my holy name, which ye have polluted among the nations whither ye are gone.
026	EZE	036	023	And I will sanctify my great name, which hath been polluted among the nations, which ye have profaned in the midst of them; and the nations shall know that I am Jehovah, when I shall be sanctified in regard to you, before their eyes, saith the Lord Jehovah.
026	EZE	036	024	For I will take you from among the nations, and gather you out of all countries, and bring you into your own land.
026	EZE	036	025	Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean. From all your uncleanness and from all your idols will I cleanse you.
026	EZE	036	026	A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you; and I will take out of your body the heart of stone, and I will give you a heart of flesh.
026	EZE	036	027	And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my commandments and do them.
026	EZE	036	028	And ye shall dwell in the land which I gave to your fathers, and ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.
026	EZE	036	029	And I will save you from all your uncleanness. And I will call for the corn, and will increase it, and bring no famine upon you.
026	EZE	036	030	And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of the field, that ye may receive no more the reproach of famine among the nations.
026	EZE	036	031	Then shall ye remember your evil ways, and your doings which were not good, and ye shall loathe yourselves for your iniquities, and for your abominations.
026	EZE	036	032	Not for your own sakes do I this, saith the Lord Jehovah, be it known to you. Be ye ashamed and confounded for your ways, O house of Israel!
026	EZE	036	033	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: In the day when I shall cleanse you from all your iniquities, then will I cause the cities to be inhabited, and the waste places to be rebuilt;
026	EZE	036	034	and the desolate land shall be tilled, whereas it lay desolate in the sight of all that passed by.
026	EZE	036	035	Then shall it be said, “This land, that was desolate, is become as the garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are become fenced, and are inhabited.”
026	EZE	036	036	Then the nations that are left around you shall know that I, Jehovah, have built that which was ruined, and planted that which was desolate. I, Jehovah, have spoken it, and I will do it.
026	EZE	036	037	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Yet will I listen to the house of Israel, and do this for them. I will increase
026	EZE	036	038	them with men like a flock; as the holy flock, as the flock of Jerusalem in her solemn feasts; so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
026	EZE	037	001	The hand of Jehovah was upon me, and he carried me out in the spirit of Jehovah, and set me in the midst of a valley, which was full of bones,
026	EZE	037	002	and caused me to pass by them round about; and behold, there were very many upon the surface of the valley, and lo, they were very dry.
026	EZE	037	003	And he said to me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Lord Jehovah, thou knowest!
026	EZE	037	004	Then he said to me, Prophesy to these dry bones, and say to them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of Jehovah!
026	EZE	037	005	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah to these bones: Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live;
026	EZE	037	006	and I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath into you, and ye shall live; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.
026	EZE	037	007	So I prophesied, as I was commanded; and as I prophesied, a voice was heard, and behold, a shaking, and the bones came together, bone to its bone.
026	EZE	037	008	And when I looked, behold, there were sinews upon them, and the flesh grew, and the skin covered them above; but there was no breath in them.
026	EZE	037	009	Then said he to me, Prophesy to breath, prophesy, O son of man, and say to breath, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live!
026	EZE	037	010	So I prophesied, as he commanded me; and the breath came into them, and they lived and stood on their feet, an exceedingly great host.
026	EZE	037	011	And he said to me, Son of man, these bones denote the whole house of Israel. Behold, they say, “Our bones are dried, and our hope is lost, and we are cut off.”
026	EZE	037	012	Therefore prophesy, and say to them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, O my people, and bring you into the land of Israel.
026	EZE	037	013	And ye shall know that I am Jehovah, when I open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, O my people,
026	EZE	037	014	and put my breath within you, and ye live, and I place you in your own land; then shall ye know that I, Jehovah, have spoken it, and done it, saith Jehovah.
026	EZE	037	015	And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:
026	EZE	037	016	Son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, “For Judah, and for the sons of Israel, his companions”; and take another stick, and write upon it, “For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and the whole house of Israel, his companions.”
026	EZE	037	017	Then join them one to another into one stick, that they may become one in thy hand.
026	EZE	037	018	And when the sons of thy people say to thee. “Wilt thou not show us what thou meanest by these?”
026	EZE	037	019	say to them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and of the tribes of Israel, his companions, and will unite them and him with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in my hand.
026	EZE	037	020	And let the sticks whereon thou writest be in thy hand before their eyes;
026	EZE	037	021	and say thou to them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will take the sons of Israel from among the nations whither they are gone, and will gather them from every side, and bring them into their own land.
026	EZE	037	022	And I will make them one nation in the land, upon the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king over them all; and they shall no more be two nations, and no more shall they be divided into two kingdoms.
026	EZE	037	023	Neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their abominations, nor with any of their transgressions; but I will save them from all their dwelling-places wherein they have sinned, and will cleanse them; and they shall be my people, and I will be their God.
026	EZE	037	024	And my servant David shall be king over them, and they shall have one shepherd; and they shall walk in my commandments, and observe my statutes, and do them.
026	EZE	037	025	And they shall dwell in the land which I gave to my servant Jacob, wherein your fathers dwelt; they shall dwell therein, and their sons and their son's sons forever; and David, my servant, shall be their prince forever.
026	EZE	037	026	And I will make with them a covenant of peace; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them. And I will place them [[in the land]], and multiply them, and set my sanctuary in the midst of them forever.
026	EZE	037	027	And my dwelling-place shall be with them; yea, I will be their God, and they shall be my people;
026	EZE	037	028	and the nations shall know that I, Jehovah, do sanctify Israel, when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them forevermore.
026	EZE	038	001	And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:
026	EZE	038	002	Son of man, set thy face against Gog, of the land of Magog, prince of Resh, Meshech, and Tubal, and prophesy against him,
026	EZE	038	003	and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against thee, O Gog, prince of Resh, Meshech, and Tubal!
026	EZE	038	004	And I will turn thee about, and put rings into thy jaws; and I will bring thee forth, thee and all thine army, horses and horsemen, all of them clothed in gorgeous apparel, even a great multitude with bucklers and shields, all of them handling swords.
026	EZE	038	005	Persians, Ethiopians, and Lybians are with them, all of them with shields and helmets.
026	EZE	038	006	Gomer and all his bands, the house of Togarmah from the north quarters, and all their hosts, many nations are with thee.
026	EZE	038	007	Be prepared, and prepare for thyself, thou and all thy host that are assembled unto thee, and be thou their leader!
026	EZE	038	008	After many days shalt thou be appointed over them. In the latter years shalt thou come into a land that is brought back from the sword, gathered out of many nations upon the mountains of Israel, which had been long desolate; but it is brought forth out of the nations, and they shall dwell securely, all of them.
026	EZE	038	009	Thou shalt go up like a storm, thou shalt come like a cloud, to cover the land, thou and all thy bands, and many nations with thee.
026	EZE	038	010	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: At the same time shall thoughts come into thy mind, and thou shalt meditate an evil design,
026	EZE	038	011	and shalt say, “I will go up to the land of unwalled villages; I will go to them that are at rest, that dwell securely, all of them dwelling without walls, and having neither bars nor gates,
026	EZE	038	012	to take a spoil and to divide a prey, to turn my hand against the desolated places that have become inhabited, and against a people gathered out of the nations, possessing cattle and goods, dwelling in the heights of the earth.”
026	EZE	038	013	Sheba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, and all the chiefs thereof, shall say to thee, “Art thou come to take a spoil? Hast thou gathered thy company to divide a prey? to carry away silver and gold, to take away cattle and goods, and to divide great spoil?”
026	EZE	038	014	Therefore prophesy, son of man, and say to Gog, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: In that day when my people Israel dwelleth securely, thou shalt observe it,
026	EZE	038	015	and thou shalt come up from the regions of the North, thou and many nations with thee, all of them riding upon horses, a great company, and a mighty host;
026	EZE	038	016	thou shalt come up against my people Israel like a cloud, to cover the land; in the latter days it shall come to pass, that I will bring thee against my land, that the nations may know me, when I shall be sanctified in regard to thee, before their eyes, O Gog!
026	EZE	038	017	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Art thou not he of whom I spoke in old time by my servants, the prophets of Israel, who prophesied in those days and years, that I would bring thee against them?
026	EZE	038	018	And it shall come to pass in that day, in the day when Gog shall come against the land of Israel, saith the Lord Jehovah, that my anger shall ascend in fury.
026	EZE	038	019	For in my jealousy, in the fire of my wrath, have I spoken, Surely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of Israel,
026	EZE	038	020	so that the fishes of the sea, and the birds of the heavens, and the beasts of the field; and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the ground, and all the men that are upon the face of the earth, shall shake at my presence; and the mountains shall be thrown down, and the steep places shall fall, and every wall shall fall to the ground.
026	EZE	038	021	And I will call for a sword against him throughout all my mountains, saith the Lord Jehovah, and they shall all turn their swords against each other,
026	EZE	038	022	And I will contend against him with pestilence, and with blood; and overflowing showers, and great hailstones, fire and brimstone, will I rain upon him and his hosts, and the many nations that are with him.
026	EZE	038	023	Thus will I show myself in my greatness and glory, and make myself known before the eyes of many nations, and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
026	EZE	039	001	And do thou, son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against thee, O Gog, prince of Resh, Meshech, and Tubal!
026	EZE	039	002	I will turn thee, and lead thee about, and cause thee to come up from the regions of the North. and bring thee upon the mountains of Israel.
026	EZE	039	003	And I will smite thy bow out of thy left hand, and cause thine arrows to fall out of thy right hand.
026	EZE	039	004	Thou shalt fall upon the mountains of Israel, thou and all thy hosts, and the nations that are with thee. To the ravenous birds of every wing, and to the beasts of the forest, give I thee to be devoured.
026	EZE	039	005	Thou shalt fall upon the open field; for I have spoken it, saith the Lord Jehovah.
026	EZE	039	006	And I will send a fire upon Magog, and upon them that dwell in security in the sea-coasts; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
026	EZE	039	007	So will I make my holy name known in the midst of my people Israel, and I will not suffer my holy name to be polluted any more; and the nations shall
026	EZE	039	008	know that I am Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel. Behold it cometh, and shall be done, saith the Lord Jehovah. This is the day of which I spake.
026	EZE	039	009	Then shall the inhabitants of the cities of Israel go forth, and set on fire and burn the weapons, the shields and the bucklers, the bows and the arrows, the hand-staves and the spears, and they shall make fires of them seven years.
026	EZE	039	010	They shall take no wood from the field, neither shall they cut down any from the forests; for they shall make their fires of the weapons. And they shall spoil those that spoiled them, and plunder those that plundered them, saith the Lord Jehovah.
026	EZE	039	011	And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will give to Gog a place there, a grave in Israel, the valley of the passengers on the east of the sea; and it shall stop the way of passengers. There shall they bury Gog and all his multitude, and they shall call it “The valley of the multitude of Gog.”
026	EZE	039	012	And seven months shall the house of Israel be burying them, that they may cleanse the land.
026	EZE	039	013	Yea, all the people of the land shall bury them; and it shall be renown to them, in the day when I shall be glorified, saith the Lord Jehovah.
026	EZE	039	014	And they shall set apart men to be constantly employed, who, passing through the land, with the aid of those that pass by, shall bury those that remain upon the face of the land to cleanse it; at the end of the seven months shall they search.
026	EZE	039	015	And when any of the travellers that pass through the land shall see a man's bone, they shall set up a sign by it, till the buriers have buried it in the valley of the multitude of Gog.
026	EZE	039	016	Also the name of a city shall be Multitude. Thus shall they cleanse the land.
026	EZE	039	017	And thou, son of man, thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Say to the birds of every wing, and to every beast of the field, Assemble yourselves and come, gather yourselves from every side to my sacrifice which I make for you, a great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel; and ye shall eat flesh and drink blood;
026	EZE	039	018	the flesh of the mighty shall ye eat, and the blood of the princes of the earth shall ye drink, of rams, of lambs, and of goats, of bullocks, all of them fatted in Bashan.
026	EZE	039	019	And ye shall eat fat till ye be full, and drink blood till ye be drunken, of my sacrifice which I make for you.
026	EZE	039	020	Thus shall ye be filled at my table with horses and riders, and mighty men and warriors of all kinds, saith the Lord Jehovah.
026	EZE	039	021	And I will set my glory among the nations, and all the nations shall see my judgment which I have executed, and my hand which I have laid upon them.
026	EZE	039	022	And the house of Israel shall know that I am Jehovah, their God, from that day and forward.
026	EZE	039	023	And the nations shall know that the house of Israel were carried into captivity for their iniquity. Because they trespassed against me, therefore hid I my face from them, and gave them into the hand of their enemies, so that they all fell by the sword.
026	EZE	039	024	According to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions have I dealt with them, and hid my face from them.
026	EZE	039	025	Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will bring back the captives of Jacob, and have compassion upon the whole house of Israel, and be jealous for my holy name.
026	EZE	039	026	Then shall they forget their shame and all their trespasses with which they trespassed against me, when they dwell in security in their own land, and none maketh them afraid.
026	EZE	039	027	When I bring them back from the nations, and gather them from the lands of their enemies, then will I be glorified in regard to them before the eyes of many nations.
026	EZE	039	028	And they shall know that I am Jehovah their God, in that I caused them to be carried into captivity among the nations, and gathered them into their own land, and left none of them there.
026	EZE	039	029	And I will hide my face from them no more; for I have poured out my spirit upon the house of Israel, saith the Lord Jehovah.
026	EZE	040	001	In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the first month, on the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year after that the city was smitten, on the selfsame day the hand of Jehovah was upon me, and he brought me [[thither into the city]].
026	EZE	040	002	In the visions of God he brought me into the land of Israel, and set me upon a very high mountain, upon which was, as it were, the frame of a city toward the south.
026	EZE	040	003	And when he had brought me thither, behold, there was a man, whose appearance was as the appearance of brass, with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring-reed, and he stood in the gate.
026	EZE	040	004	And the man said to me, Son of man, behold with thine eyes and hear with thine ears, and give heed to all which I shall show thee; for to the intent that I might show them to thee art thou brought hither; declare all which thou seest to the house of Israel!
026	EZE	040	005	And behold, a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the man's hand a measuring reed, in length six cubits of a cubit and a handbreadth; and he measured the breadth of the wall, one reed; and the height, one reed.
026	EZE	040	006	Then came he to the gate, which looked toward the east, and went up the steps thereof, and measured the upper threshold of the gate, one reed broad, and the other threshold of the gate one reed broad.
026	EZE	040	007	And every chamber was one reed long, and one reed broad; and between the chambers were five cubits; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate within was one reed.
026	EZE	040	008	He measured also the porch of the gate within, one reed.
026	EZE	040	009	Then he measured the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and the border thereof, two cubits; now the porch of the gate was inward.
026	EZE	040	010	And the chambers of the gate eastward were three on this side, and three on that side; they three were of one measure, and the projecting wall-pillars were of one measure on this side, and on that side.
026	EZE	040	011	And he measured the breadth of the entry of the gate, ten cubits; and the length of the entry of the gate, thirteen cubits.
026	EZE	040	012	There was also a space before the chambers one cubit on this side, and a space one cubit on that side; and every chamber was six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side.
026	EZE	040	013	Then he measured the gate from the roof of one chamber to the roof of another; the breadth was five and twenty cubits, and door was over against door.
026	EZE	040	014	He made also wall-pillars sixty cubits, and toward the pillars, was the court of the gate round about on every side.
026	EZE	040	015	And from the front of the gate of the entrance to the front of the porch of the inner gate were fifty cubits.
026	EZE	040	016	And there were closed windows to the chambers and to their wall-pillars inward toward the gate round about, and likewise to the cornices; there were windows round about within, and upon the wall-pillars were palm-trees.
026	EZE	040	017	Then he brought me into the outer court, and behold, there were rooms, and a pavement made for the court round about; thirty rooms were upon the pavement.
026	EZE	040	018	And the pavement at the sides of the gates, by the length of the gates, was the lower pavement.
026	EZE	040	019	Then he measured the breadth from the front of the lower gate to the front of the inner court without, a hundred cubits toward the east and toward the north.
026	EZE	040	020	And as for the gate that looked toward the north in the outer court, he measured the length thereof, and the breadth thereof.
026	EZE	040	021	And the chambers thereof were three on this side, and three on that side. And the border thereof, and the cornices thereof, were of the same measure as the former gate; the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.
026	EZE	040	022	And the windows thereof, and the cornices thereof, and the palm-trees thereof were of the same measure as the gate which looked toward the east, and they went up to it by seven steps, and the cornices thereof were before them.
026	EZE	040	023	And the gate of the inner court was over against the gate toward the north and east. And he measured from gate to gate a hundred cubits.
026	EZE	040	024	Then he led me toward the south; and behold, there was a gate toward the south; and he measured the border thereof and the cornices thereof according to those measures.
026	EZE	040	025	And there were windows in it, and within the cornices thereof round about, like those windows; the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.
026	EZE	040	026	And there were seven steps to go up to it, and the cornices thereof were before them; and it had palm-trees, one on this side and another on that side, upon the wall-pillars thereof.
026	EZE	040	027	And there was a gate in the inner court toward the south; and he measured from gate to gate toward the south a hundred cubits.
026	EZE	040	028	And he brought me to the inner court through the south gate; and he measured the south gate according to the same measures.
026	EZE	040	029	And the chambers thereof, and the border thereof, and the cornices thereof were according to those measures. And there were windows in it, and within the cornices thereof, round about; it was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad.
026	EZE	040	030	And the cornices round about were five and twenty cubits long, and five cubits broad.
026	EZE	040	031	And the cornices thereof were toward the outer court; and palm-trees were upon the wall-pillars thereof; and in going up to it there were eight steps.
026	EZE	040	032	And he brought me to the inner court toward the east; and he measured the gate according to those measures.
026	EZE	040	033	And the chambers thereof, and the border thereof, and the cornices thereof, were according to those measures; and there were windows in it, and in the cornices thereof, round about; the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.
026	EZE	040	034	And the cornices thereof were toward the outer court; and palm-trees were upon the wall-pillars thereof, on this side and on that side; and in going up to it there were eight steps.
026	EZE	040	035	And he brought me to the north gate, and measured it according to those measures;
026	EZE	040	036	the chambers thereof, and the border thereof, and the cornices thereof; and there were windows to it, round about; the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.
026	EZE	040	037	And the cornices thereof were toward the outer court; and palm-trees were upon the wall-pillars thereof, on this side and on that side; and in going up to it there were eight steps.
026	EZE	040	038	And a room with its doors was by the borders of the gates, where they washed the burnt-offering.
026	EZE	040	039	And in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side, and two tables on that side, to slay thereon the burnt-offering, and the sin-offering, and the trespass-offering.
026	EZE	040	040	And at the side without, as one goeth up to the entrance of the north gate, were two tables; and on the other side, which was at the porch of the gate, were two tables;
026	EZE	040	041	four tables were on this side, and four tables on that side; on the other side of the gate eight tables, whereon they slew their sacrifices.
026	EZE	040	042	And the four tables for the burnt-offering were of hewn stone; their length was a cubit and a half, and their breadth a cubit and a half, and their height a cubit. Thereon they laid the instruments with which they slew the burnt-offering and the sacrifice.
026	EZE	040	043	And there were edging-boards of a handbreadth, prepared within round about; and upon the tables was the flesh of the offering.
026	EZE	040	044	And without the inner gate were rooms for the singers in the inner court; they were at the side of the north gate, and their prospect was toward the south; one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north.
026	EZE	040	045	And he said to me, This room, whose prospect is toward the south, is for the priests that keep the charge of the house.
026	EZE	040	046	And the room whose prospect is toward the north is for the priests that keep the charge of the altar. These are the sons of Zadok, who, among the sons of Levi, come near to Jehovah to minister to him.
026	EZE	040	047	Then he measured the court; its length was a hundred cubits, and its breadth a hundred cubits, being square. And the altar stood before the house.
026	EZE	040	048	Then he brought me to the porch of the temple, and he measured the door-border of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side. And the breadth of the gate was three cubits on this side, and three cubits on that side.
026	EZE	040	049	The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits; and they went up to it by steps. And there were columns by the door-border, one on this side, and another on that side.
026	EZE	041	001	Afterwards he brought me to the temple; and he measured the projecting wall-pillars, six cubits broad on this side, and six cubits broad on that side, according to the breadth of the house.
026	EZE	041	002	And the breadth of the door was ten cubits; and the sides of the door were five cubits on this side; and five cubits on that side. Then he measured the length, forty cubits, and the breadth, twenty cubits.
026	EZE	041	003	And he went inward, and measured the border of the door, two cubits; and the door, six cubits; and the breadth of the door, seven cubits.
026	EZE	041	004	Then he measured twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth in the temple, and said to me, This is the most holy place.
026	EZE	041	005	And he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the breadth of every side-chamber, four cubits round about, round about the house:
026	EZE	041	006	And the side-chambers were chamber to chamber, three and thirty times; and they entered into the wall of the house of the side-chambers round about, and were connected with it; but they were not connected with the wall of the house.
026	EZE	041	007	And, the side-chambers became wider upward, having a winding ascent. For the circuit of the house went still upward, round about the house; therefore the greater breadth of the house was upward; and so they ascended from the lowest story to the highest through the middle story.
026	EZE	041	008	I saw also the height of the house round about; the foundations of the side-chambers were a full reed, six cubits to the knuckles.
026	EZE	041	009	The thickness of the wall of the side-chambers outward was five cubits, and the space which was left was the place of the side-chambers of the house.
026	EZE	041	010	And between the rooms was the breadth of twenty cubits round about the house on every side.
026	EZE	041	011	And the doors of the side-chambers were toward the space that was left, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south; and the breadth of the space that was left was five cubits round about.
026	EZE	041	012	And the building which was before the separate place, at the side toward the west, was seventy cubits broad; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick round about, and the length thereof was ninety cubits.
026	EZE	041	013	Then he measured the length of the house, a hundred cubits; and the length of the separate place and the building and the walls thereof, a hundred cubits.
026	EZE	041	014	Also the breadth towards the front of the house and of the separate place toward the east was a hundred cubits.
026	EZE	041	015	And he measured the length of the building before the separate place, and that which was behind it, and the galleries thereof on this side and on that side, a hundred cubits; and the inner temple, and the porches of the court,
026	EZE	041	016	the thresholds, and the windows that were closed, and the galleries round about the three sides. Over against the threshold was a table of wood round about, from the ground to the windows, and the windows were covered with it;
026	EZE	041	017	upon the space above every door, and upon the inner house, and without, and upon all the wall round about within and without, according to measure.
026	EZE	041	018	And cherubs and palm-trees were made, one palm-tree between two cherubs, and every cherub had two faces;
026	EZE	041	019	and the face of a man was toward a palm-tree on one side, and the face of a lion toward a palm-tree on the other side. So was it made upon all the house round about.
026	EZE	041	020	From the ground to above the door were cherubs and palm-trees made, and on the wall of the temple.
026	EZE	041	021	The posts of the temple were four-square; and the front of the sanctuary had the same appearance.
026	EZE	041	022	The altar was of wood, three cubits high, and two cubits long; and the corners thereof and the base thereof and the walls thereof were of wood. And he said to me, This is the table that standeth before Jehovah.
026	EZE	041	023	And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors.
026	EZE	041	024	And the two doors had two leaves apiece, two turning leaves; two leaves for one door, and two leaves for the other door.
026	EZE	041	025	And there were made on them, even on the doors of the temple, cherubs and palm-trees, such as were made upon the walls, and a wooden threshold was before the porch without.
026	EZE	041	026	And at the closed windows were palm-trees on this side, and on that side, on the sides of the porch, and on the side-chambers of the house, and on the thresholds.
026	EZE	042	001	Then he led me forth to the outer court, in the direction toward the north, and he brought me to the rooms which were before the separate place, and before the building toward the north.
026	EZE	042	002	The length was a hundred cubits before the gate toward the north, and the breadth was fifty cubits;
026	EZE	042	003	over against the twenty cubits in the inner court, and over against the pavement in the outer court, was gallery before gallery, in three rows.
026	EZE	042	004	And before the chambers was a walk of ten cubits breadth inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors were toward the north.
026	EZE	042	005	And the upper rooms were narrower (for the galleries took away room from them) than the lower and middle chambers of the building.
026	EZE	042	006	For they were in three stories; but had not pillars, as the pillars of the courts; therefore they were narrower than the lowest, and than the middlemost from the ground.
026	EZE	042	007	And as to the wall that was without, over against the chambers, toward the outer court, before the chambers, the length thereof was fifty cubits.
026	EZE	042	008	For the length of the rooms that were in the outer court was fifty cubits; but before the temple it was a hundred cubits.
026	EZE	042	009	And under these rooms was an entry from the east, as one came to them from the outer court.
026	EZE	042	010	In the breadth of the wall of the court toward the east, before the separate place and before the building, were rooms.
026	EZE	042	011	And there was a way before them similar to that before the rooms toward the north. Both their length and their breadth were the same, and all their goings out and their fashions and their doors were the same.
026	EZE	042	012	And so also were the doors of the rooms toward the south; there was a door at the head of the way, before the well-built wall in the way toward the east, as one entered into them.
026	EZE	042	013	Then he said to me, The north rooms and the south rooms, which are before the separate place, are holy rooms, where the priests, when they come near to Jehovah, eat the most holy things. There shall they lay the most holy things, both the flour-offering and the sin-offering and the trespass-offering; for the place is holy.
026	EZE	042	014	When the priests enter therein, then shall they not go out of the holy place into the outer court, but shall leave there the garments in which they minister; for they are holy; and shall put on other garments, and approach to the place which belongeth to the people.
026	EZE	042	015	Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me forth to the gate, whose prospect is toward the east, and measured it round about.
026	EZE	042	016	He measured the east side with the measuring-reed, five hundred reeds with the measuring-reed round about.
026	EZE	042	017	He measured the north side five hundred reeds with the measuring-reed round about.
026	EZE	042	018	He measured the south side five hundred reeds with the measuring-reed.
026	EZE	042	019	He turned himself also to the west side, and measured five hundred reeds with the measuring-reed.
026	EZE	042	020	On all the four sides measured he the wall round about five hundred reeds in length, and five hundred in breadth, to make a separation between the holy and the unholy place.
026	EZE	043	001	Then he brought me to the gate, even to the gate that looketh toward the east.
026	EZE	043	002	And behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the east; and the sound thereof was as the sound of great waters, and the earth shone with his glory.
026	EZE	043	003	And the appearance was like the vision which I saw, like the vision which I saw when I came to destroy the city; it was a vision like the vision which I saw at the river Chebar. And I fell upon my face.
026	EZE	043	004	And the glory of Jehovah came into the house by way of the gate, whose prospect was toward the east.
026	EZE	043	005	Then the spirit took me up and brought me into the inner court; and behold, the glory of Jehovah filled the house.
026	EZE	043	006	And I heard one speaking to me out of the house, and a man was standing by me.
026	EZE	043	007	And he said to me: Son of man, this is the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the sons of Israel forever; and the house of Israel shall no more pollute my holy name, neither they nor their kings, by their fornication, and by the dead bodies of their kings in their sepulchres;
026	EZE	043	008	in that they set their threshold by my threshold, and their post near my post, so that there was only a wall between me and them, and defiled my holy name by the abominations which they committed; wherefore I have consumed them in my anger.
026	EZE	043	009	Now let them remove far away from me their fornication, and the carcasses of their kings; and I will dwell in the midst of them forever.
026	EZE	043	010	And thou, son of man, show this house to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities, and that they may measure the pattern.
026	EZE	043	011	And if they be ashamed of all which they have done, let them know the form of the house and the fashion thereof, and the passages for going out and coming in, and all the forms thereof, and all the statutes thereof, and all the laws thereof, and write it in their sight, that they may keep the whole form thereof, and all the statutes thereof, and do them.
026	EZE	043	012	This is the law of the house. Upon the top of the mountain, all within its limits shall be most holy. Behold, this is the law of the house.
026	EZE	043	013	And these are the measures of the altar by cubits; each cubit being a cubit and a hand-breadth. The bottom shall be a cubit high and a cubit broad; and the border thereof, by the edge thereof round about, shall be a span; and this shall be the outer part of the altar.
026	EZE	043	014	And from the bottom upon the ground to the lower ledge shall be two cubits, and the breadth one cubit; and from the lesser ledge to the greater ledge shall be four cubits, and the breadth a cubit.
026	EZE	043	015	And the altar shall be four cubits; and from the altar upward shall be four horns.
026	EZE	043	016	And the altar shall be twelve cubits long by twelve broad; square on the four sides thereof.
026	EZE	043	017	And the ledge shall be fourteen cubits long by fourteen broad on the four sides thereof; and the border about it shall be half a cubit; and the bottom thereof shall be a cubit round about; and its steps shall look toward the east.
026	EZE	043	018	And he said to me, Son of man, thus saith the Lord Jehovah: These are the statutes of the altar, in the day when it is made, to offer burnt-offerings thereon, and to sprinkle blood thereon.
026	EZE	043	019	To the priests, the sons of Levi, of the race of Zadok, that come near to me, saith the Lord Jehovah, to minister to me, thou shalt give a young bullock for a sin-offering.
026	EZE	043	020	And thou shalt take of the blood thereof, and put it on its four horns, and on the four corners of the ledge, and on the border round about, and thus cleanse and purge it.
026	EZE	043	021	And thou shalt take the bullock of the sin-offering, and it shall be burned in the appointed place of the house, without the sanctuary.
026	EZE	043	022	And on the second day thou shalt offer a he-goat without blemish for a sin-offering; and they shall cleanse the altar, as they cleansed it with the bullock.
026	EZE	043	023	And when thou hast made an end of cleansing it, thou shalt offer a young bullock without blemish, and a ram out of the flock without blemish.
026	EZE	043	024	And thou shalt offer them before Jehovah, and the priests shall cast salt upon them, and offer them up for a burnt-offering to Jehovah.
026	EZE	043	025	Seven days shalt thou sacrifice daily a goat for a sin-offering; they shall also sacrifice a young bullock, and a ram out of the flock without blemish.
026	EZE	043	026	Seven days shall they purge the altar, and purify it, and consecrate themselves.
026	EZE	043	027	And when they have finished these days, it shall be that on the eighth day and forward the priests shall present your burnt-offerings and your thank-offerings upon the altar, and I will accept you, saith the Lord Jehovah.
026	EZE	044	001	Then he brought me back to the outer gate of the sanctuary, which looketh toward the east; and it was shut.
026	EZE	044	002	Then said Jehovah to me: This gate shall be shut; it shall not be opened, and no man shall enter in by it; because Jehovah, the God of Israel, entered in by it, therefore it shall be shut.
026	EZE	044	003	The prince, because he is prince, shall sit in it, to eat food before Jehovah; he shall enter through the porch of that gate, and by the same way shall he go out.
026	EZE	044	004	Then he brought me to the north gate before the house; and I looked, and behold, the glory of Jehovah filled the house of Jehovah. And I fell upon my face.
026	EZE	044	005	And Jehovah said to me: Son of man, mark well, and behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears all that I say to thee concerning all the ordinances of the house of Jehovah, and all the laws thereof; and mark well all the entrances of the house, and all the outward passages of the sanctuary.
026	EZE	044	006	And say to the rebellious house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Let it suffice you of all your abominations, O house of Israel,
026	EZE	044	007	in that ye brought strangers, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary, so that ye polluted my house when ye offered my food, the fat and the blood, and broke my covenant by all your abominations.
026	EZE	044	008	And ye kept not the charge of my holy place, but appointed for yourselves such keepers of my charge in my sanctuary.
026	EZE	044	009	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: No stranger, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary, of all the strangers that are among the sons of Israel.
026	EZE	044	010	But even the Levites, who departed from me when Israel went astray, who went astray from me after their idols, shall bear their iniquity.
026	EZE	044	011	Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, having charge at the gates of the house, and ministering at the house; they shall slay the burnt-offering and sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to minister to them.
026	EZE	044	012	Because they ministered to them before their idols, and caused the house of Israel to fall into iniquity, therefore have I lifted up my hand against them, saith the Lord Jehovah, that they shall bear their iniquity.
026	EZE	044	013	And they shall not come near to me to do the office of a priest to me, and to come near to any of my holy things in the most holy place, but they shall bear their shame, and their abominations which they have committed.
026	EZE	044	014	But I will make them keepers of the charge of the house, for all the service thereof, and for all which is to be done therein.
026	EZE	044	015	But the priests, the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that kept the charge of my sanctuary when the sons of Israel went astray from me, they shall come near to me to minister to me, and they shall stand before me to offer to me the fat and the blood, saith the Lord Jehovah.
026	EZE	044	016	They shall come into my sanctuary, and they shall draw near to my table to minister to me, and shall keep my charge.
026	EZE	044	017	And when they enter the gates of the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen garments, and no wool shall come upon them while they minister in the gates of the inner court, and within the house.
026	EZE	044	018	They shall have linen coverings upon their heads, and linen breeches upon their loins; they shall not gird themselves with anything that causeth sweat.
026	EZE	044	019	And when they go forth into the outer court, even into the outer court to the people, they shall put off their garments in which they ministered, and lay them in the holy rooms, and shall clothe themselves with other garments, that they may not sanctify the people with their garments.
026	EZE	044	020	They shall neither shave their heads, nor suffer their locks to grow long; they shall shear their heads.
026	EZE	044	021	And no priest shall drink wine when they enter into the inner court.
026	EZE	044	022	Neither shall they take for their wives a widow, or her that is put away; but they shall take virgins of the race of the house of Israel, or a widow that is the widow of a priest.
026	EZE	044	023	And they shall teach my people the difference between the holy and unholy, and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean.
026	EZE	044	024	And in controversy they shall stand to judge; according to my statutes shall they judge. And they shall keep my laws and my statutes in all my festivals, and they shall hallow my sabbaths.
026	EZE	044	025	And they shall come to no dead person to defile themselves; but for father, or for mother, or for son, or for daughter, for brother, or for sister that hath had no husband, they may defile themselves.
026	EZE	044	026	And after his cleansing they shall reckon to him seven days.
026	EZE	044	027	And in the day that he goeth into the sanctuary, into the inner court, to minister in the sanctuary, he shall offer his sin-offering, saith the Lord Jehovah.
026	EZE	044	028	And it shall be to them for an inheritance, that I am their inheritance. And ye shall give them no possession in Israel; I am their possession.
026	EZE	044	029	They shall eat the flour-offering, and the sin-offering, and the trespass-offering; and every dedicated thing in Israel shall be theirs.
026	EZE	044	030	And the first of all the first-fruits, and every oblation of all your oblations, shall belong to the priests. Ye shall also give to the priest the first of your meal, that he may cause a blessing to rest on thine house.
026	EZE	044	031	The priests shall not eat of anything that dieth of itself, or that is torn, whether it be fowl or beast.
026	EZE	045	001	Moreover, when ye shall divide by lot the land for inheritance, ye shall offer an oblation to Jehovah, a holy portion of the land; the length shall be five and twenty thousand reeds, and the breadth ten thousand. This shall be holy in all its borders round about.
026	EZE	045	002	And of this there shall be for the sanctuary five hundred in length and five hundred in breadth square round about; and fifty cubits round about for the suburbs thereof.
026	EZE	045	003	And of this measure shalt thou measure in length five and twenty thousand, and in breadth ten thousand; and in it shall be the sanctuary, the most holy place.
026	EZE	045	004	This is the holy portion of the land; it shall be for the priests, the ministers of the sanctuary, who come near to minister to Jehovah; and it shall be a place for their houses, and a holy place for the sanctuary.
026	EZE	045	005	Five and twenty thousand in length, and ten thousand in breadth, shall the Levites, the ministers of the house, have for themselves for a possession, and twenty rooms.
026	EZE	045	006	And ye shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand in breadth, and five and twenty thousand in length, over against the oblation of the holy portion; it shall be for all the house of Israel.
026	EZE	045	007	And a portion shall be for the prince on this side and on that side of the oblation of the holy portion and of the possession of the city, before the oblation of the holy portion and before the possession of the city, from the west side westward, and from the east side eastward; and the length shall be over against every one of the portions, from the west border to the east border.
026	EZE	045	008	As for the land, it shall be to him a possession in Israel, that my princes may no more oppress my people, but give the rest of the land to the house of Israel according to their tribes.
026	EZE	045	009	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Let it suffice you, O princes of Israel! Remove violence and spoil, and execute judgment and justice, and cease from your expulsions of my people, saith the Lord Jehovah.
026	EZE	045	010	Ye shall have just balances, and a just ephah, and a just bath.
026	EZE	045	011	The ephah and the bath shall be of one measure; that the bath may contain the tenth part of a homer, and the ephah the tenth part of a homer; the measure thereof shall be according to the homer.
026	EZE	045	012	And the shekel shall be twenty gerahs; twenty shekels, five and twenty shekels, and fifteen shekels shall be to you one maneh.
026	EZE	045	013	This is the heave-offering which ye shall offer: the sixth part of an ephah out of a homer of wheat, and the sixth part of an ephah out of a homer of barley.
026	EZE	045	014	And as for the statute concerning oil, the bath of oil, ye shall offer the tenth part of a bath out of a cor; a cor being ten baths; for a homer is ten baths.
026	EZE	045	015	And ye shall offer one lamb out of the flock, out of two hundred, from the watered pastures of Israel, for the flour-offering and for the burnt-offering, and for the thank-offerings, to make reconciliation for them, saith the Lord Jehovah.
026	EZE	045	016	All the people of the land shall give this heave-offering for the prince in Israel.
026	EZE	045	017	And it shall be the duty of the prince to give burnt-offerings, and flour-offerings, and drink-offerings, in the feasts, and in the new moons, and in the sabbaths, and in all the solemn assemblies of the house of Israel; he shall present the sin-offering, and the flour-offering, and the burnt-offering, and the peace-offerings, to make reconciliation for the house of Israel.
026	EZE	045	018	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: In the first month, on the first day of the month, thou shalt take a young bullock without blemish, and shalt cleanse the sanctuary.
026	EZE	045	019	And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin-offering, and put it upon the posts of the house, and upon the four corners of the ledge of the altar, and upon the posts of the gate of the inner court.
026	EZE	045	020	And so shalt thou do on the seventh day for him that hath transgressed through error or simplicity; so shall ye make reconciliation for the house.
026	EZE	045	021	In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, ye shall have the passover, a feast of seven days; every one shall eat unleavened bread.
026	EZE	045	022	And upon that day shall the prince sacrifice for himself and for all the people of the land a bullock for a sin-offering.
026	EZE	045	023	And the seven days of the feast he shall sacrifice a burnt-offering to Jehovah, seven bullocks and seven rams without blemish daily the seven days; and a he-goat daily for a sin-offering.
026	EZE	045	024	And he shall present a flour-offering, an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and a hin of oil for an ephah.
026	EZE	045	025	In the seventh month, on the fifteenth day of the month, shall he do the like, in the feast, seven days, according to the sin-offering, and the burnt-offering, and the flour-offering, and the oil.
026	EZE	046	001	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: The gate of the inner court, that looketh toward the east, shall be shut the six working-days; but on the sabbath it shall be opened, and on the day of the new moon it shall be opened.
026	EZE	046	002	And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of the outer gate, and shall stand by the post of the gate, and the priests shall present his burnt-offerings, and his peace-offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate; then he shall go forth; but the gate shall not be shut until the evening.
026	EZE	046	003	Likewise the people of the land shall worship at the door of this gate before Jehovah on the sabbaths and on the new moons.
026	EZE	046	004	And the burnt-offering, which the prince shall offer to Jehovah on the sabbath-day, shall be six lambs without blemish, and a ram without blemish.
026	EZE	046	005	And the flour-offering shall be an ephah for a ram; and the flour-offering for the lambs as much as he is disposed to give; and a hin of oil to an ephah.
026	EZE	046	006	And in the day of the new moon there shall be a young bullock without blemish, and six lambs and a ram; they shall be without blemish.
026	EZE	046	007	And he shall present, as a flour-offering, an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs as much as he is able to give; and a hin of oil to an ephah.
026	EZE	046	008	And when the prince shall enter, he shall go in by the way of the porch of that gate, and he shall go forth by the way thereof.
026	EZE	046	009	But when the people of the land come before Jehovah in the solemn feasts, he that entereth by the way of the north gate to worship shall go out by the way of the south gate; and he that entereth by the way of the south gate shall go forth by the way of the north gate; he shall not return by the way of the gate by which he entered, but shall go forth over against it.
026	EZE	046	010	And the prince shall go in in the midst of them when they go in, and when they go forth shall he go forth.
026	EZE	046	011	And in the feasts and in the solemn assemblies the flour-offering shall be an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs what he is disposed to give; and a hin of oil to an ephah.
026	EZE	046	012	And when the prince shall present a free-will burnt-offering or a free-will thank-offering to Jehovah, the gate that looketh toward the east shall be opened for him, and he shall present his burnt-offering, or his thank-offering, as he was wont to do on the sabbath-day; then he shall go forth, and the gate shall be shut after he hath gone forth.
026	EZE	046	013	And thou shalt present for a burnt-offering daily to Jehovah a lamb that is a year old without blemish; every morning shalt thou present it.
026	EZE	046	014	And thou shalt present with it every morning a flour-offering, the sixth part of an ephah, and the third part of a hin of oil to moisten the fine flour, for a flour-offering to Jehovah, by a perpetual statute continually.
026	EZE	046	015	Thus shall they prepare the lamb, and the flour-offering, and the oil, every morning, for a continual burnt-offering.
026	EZE	046	016	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: If the prince give a gift to any of his sons, the inheritance thereof shall belong to his sons; it shall be their possession by inheritance.
026	EZE	046	017	But if he give a gift of his inheritance to one of his servants, it shall be his to the year of liberty, when it shall return to the prince. But his inheritance given to his sons shall be theirs.
026	EZE	046	018	And the prince shall not take of the people's inheritance, to thrust them out of their possession; but he shall give an inheritance to his sons out of his own possession; that no one of my people may be driven from his possession.
026	EZE	046	019	Then he brought me through the entry, which was at the side of the gate, into the holy rooms for the priests, which looked toward the north; and behold, there was a place behind toward the west.
026	EZE	046	020	And he said to me: This is the place where the priests shall boil the trespass-offering, and the sin-offering, and bake the flour-offering; that they may not bear them into the outer court, and so sanctify the people.
026	EZE	046	021	Then he brought me forth into the outer court, and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court; and behold, there was a court in every corner of the court.
026	EZE	046	022	In the four corners of the court were covered courts forty cubits long, and thirty broad; these four corners were of one measure.
026	EZE	046	023	And there was in them a wall round about, even round about the four; and boiling-places were made under the walls round about.
026	EZE	046	024	Then said he to me, These are the places of them that boil, where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the people.
026	EZE	047	001	Afterward he brought me again to the door of the house; and behold, waters issued forth from under the threshold of the house eastward; for the fore-front of the house stood toward the east. And the waters flowed down from the side of the house, south of the altar.
026	EZE	047	002	Then he brought me out by the way of the gate northward; and he brought me round by the way without to the outer gate, that looked toward the east; and behold, there ran out waters from the right side.
026	EZE	047	003	And when the man that had the line in his hand went forth eastward, he measured a thousand cubits, and he led me through the waters, and the waters were to the soles of the feet.
026	EZE	047	004	Again he measured a thousand cubits, and led me through the waters, and the waters were to the knees. Again he measured a thousand cubits, and led me through, and the waters were to the loins.
026	EZE	047	005	Again he measured a thousand cubits, and it was a river, which I could not pass through; for the waters were high, waters to swim in, a river which could not be passed through.
026	EZE	047	006	And he said to me, Hast thou seen this, son of man? Then he brought me back to the brink of the river.
026	EZE	047	007	Now when I had returned, behold, at the brink of the river were very many trees, on the one side and on the other.
026	EZE	047	008	Then said he to me, These waters issue forth toward the east region, and run down into the desert, and go into the sea; they go forth into the sea, and the waters shall be healed.
026	EZE	047	009	And it shall come to pass, that every living thing that moveth, whithersoever the river shall come, shall live, and there shall be very many fish there; for when these waters shall come thither, [[the waters of the sea]] shall be healed, and everything shall live whither the river cometh.
026	EZE	047	010	And it shall come to pass that fishers shall stand upon it; from En-gedi to En-eglaim shall be places to spread nets; and therein shall be fish according to their kinds, like the fish of the great sea, exceeding many.
026	EZE	047	011	But the miry places thereof, and the marshes thereof, shall not be healed; they shall be appointed for salt.
026	EZE	047	012	And by the river, upon the bank thereof, on this side and on that side, shall grow all trees for food, whose leaf shall not fade, and whose fruit shall not fail; every month shall they bring forth new fruit; because their waters issue forth from the sanctuary. And their fruit shall be for food, and their leaves for medicine.
026	EZE	047	013	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: This is the border, according to which ye shall distribute the land among the twelve tribes of Israel. Joseph shall have two portions.
026	EZE	047	014	And ye shall inherit it, one like another. For I have lifted up my hand, that I would give it to your fathers; and this land shall fall to you for an inheritance.
026	EZE	047	015	And this shall be the border of the land toward the north side: from the great sea toward the way of Hethlon, as men go to Zedad,
026	EZE	047	016	Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath, and Hazar-hatticon, which is by the coast of Hauran.
026	EZE	047	017	And the border from the sea shall be Hazar-Enon, the border of Damascus and farther northward, and the border of Hamath.
026	EZE	047	018	This is the north side. And the east side ye shall measure between Hauran and Damascus, and between Gilead and the land of Israel by the Jordan, from the border to the east sea. This is the east side.
026	EZE	047	019	And the south side southward shall be from Tamar to the waters of strife in Kadesh, as far as the river by the great sea.
026	EZE	047	020	This is the south side southward. And the west side shall be the great sea, from the border till a man come over against Hamath. This is the west side.
026	EZE	047	021	So shall ye divide this land among you, according to the tribes of Israel.
026	EZE	047	022	And ye shall divide it by lot for an inheritance to you, and to the strangers that sojourn among you, who have begotten children among you; and they shall be to you as born in the country among the sons of Israel; they shall have an inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel.
026	EZE	047	023	And it shall come to pass, that in what tribe the stranger sojourneth there shall ye appoint him his inheritance, saith the Lord Jehovah.
026	EZE	048	001	And these are the names of the tribes. From the north end by the way of Hethlon, as one goeth to Hamath, Hazar-Enan, the border of Damascus northward toward Hamath; and to him belongeth from the east side to the west side: Dan, one tribe.
026	EZE	048	002	And by the border of Dan, from the east side to the west side: Asher, one tribe.
026	EZE	048	003	And by the border of Asher, from the east side to the west side: Naphtali, one tribe.
026	EZE	048	004	And by the border of Naphtali, from the east side to the west side: Manasseh, one tribe.
026	EZE	048	005	And by the border of Manasseh, from the east side to the west side: Ephraim, one tribe.
026	EZE	048	006	And by the border of Ephraim, from the east side to the west side: Reuben, one tribe.
026	EZE	048	007	And by the border of Reuben, from the east side to the west side: Judah, one tribe.
026	EZE	048	008	And by the border of Judah, from the east side to the west, shall be the oblation which ye shall offer, five and twenty thousand reeds in breadth, and in length as one of the other portions from the east side to the west side; and the sanctuary shall be in the midst of it.
026	EZE	048	009	The oblation which ye shall offer to Jehovah shall be five and twenty thousand reeds in length, and ten thousand in breadth.
026	EZE	048	010	And the holy oblation shall be for these: for the priests toward the north five and twenty thousand reeds in length, and toward the west ten thousand in breadth, and toward the east ten thousand in breadth, and toward the south five and twenty thousand in length. And the sanctuary of Jehovah shall be in the midst thereof.
026	EZE	048	011	It shall belong to the priests, the sanctified ones, to the sons of Zadok, who kept my charge, who went not astray when the sons of Israel went astray, as the Levites went astray.
026	EZE	048	012	And it shall belong to them as an oblation out of the oblation of the land, as most holy, by the border of the Levites.
026	EZE	048	013	And over against the border of the priests, the Levites shall have five and twenty thousand reeds in length and ten thousand in breadth; the whole length five and twenty thousand, and the breadth ten thousand.
026	EZE	048	014	And they shall not sell of it; neither shall they exchange or transfer the first fruits of the land; for it is holy to Jehovah.
026	EZE	048	015	And the five thousand which are left in breadth, over against the five and twenty thousand in length, shall be common land for the city, for habitation and for suburbs. And the city shall be in the midst of it.
026	EZE	048	016	And this shall be the measure thereof: the north side four thousand and five hundred, and the south side four thousand and five hundred, and the east side four thousand and five hundred, and the west side four thousand and five hundred.
026	EZE	048	017	And the suburbs of the city shall be toward the north two hundred and fifty, and toward the south two hundred and fifty, and toward the east two hundred and fifty, and toward the west two hundred and fifty.
026	EZE	048	018	And as to the residue in length, over against the holy portion, ten thousand eastward and ten thousand westward, over against the holy portion, its increase shall be for food to them that serve the city.
026	EZE	048	019	And they that serve the city shall serve it out of all the tribes of Israel.
026	EZE	048	020	All the oblation shall be five and twenty thousand reeds by five and twenty thousand; ye shall offer the holy oblation, four-square, together with the possession of the city.
026	EZE	048	021	And the residue on both sides of the holy oblation and of the possession of the city, over against the five and twenty thousand to the east border, and westward over against the five and twenty thousand to the west border, by the portions of the tribes, shall be for the prince; and the holy oblation and the sanctuary of the house shall be in the midst thereof.
026	EZE	048	022	What is left from the possession of the Levites and of the city, which are between what belongs to the prince, between the borders of Judah and Benjamin, shall belong to the prince.
026	EZE	048	023	And as for the rest of the tribes, from the east side to the west side: Benjamin, one tribe.
026	EZE	048	024	And by the border of Benjamin, from the east side to the west side: Simeon, one tribe.
026	EZE	048	025	And by the border of Simeon, from the east side to the west side: Issachar, one tribe.
026	EZE	048	026	And by the border of Issachar, from the east side to the west side: Zebulon, one tribe.
026	EZE	048	027	And by the border of Zebulon, from the east side to the west side: Gad, one tribe.
026	EZE	048	028	And by the border of Gad, at the south side southward, shall the border be from Tamar to the waters of strife in Kadesh, even to the river by the great sea.
026	EZE	048	029	This is the land which ye shall divide by lot of the possession among the tribes of Israel, and these are their portions, saith the Lord Jehovah.
026	EZE	048	030	And these are the gates of the city. On the north side shall the measure be four thousand five hundred reeds.
026	EZE	048	031	And the gates of the city shall be after the names of the tribes of Israel; three gates northward, —one gate of Reuben, one gate of Judah, one gate of Levi.
026	EZE	048	032	And on the east side shall be four thousand and five hundred [[reeds]]; and three gates, —one gate of Joseph, one gate of Benjamin, one gate of Dan.
026	EZE	048	033	And on the south side its measure shall be four thousand five hundred; and three gates, —one gate of Simeon, one gate of Issachar, one gate of Zebulon.
026	EZE	048	034	On the west side, four thousand and five hundred; and three gates, —one gate of Gad, one gate of Asher, one gate of Naphtali.
026	EZE	048	035	Its measure round about was eighteen thousand reeds. And the name of the city from that day shall be Jehovah-is-there.

# BOOK	027	DAN	Daniel	Daniel
027	DAN	001	001	In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, came Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, against Jerusalem, and besieged it.
027	DAN	001	002	And the Lord gave Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God; and he carried them into the land of Shinar, to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure-house of his god.
027	DAN	001	003	And the king commanded Ashpenaz, the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring certain of the sons of Israel of the king's race, and of the princes,
027	DAN	001	004	youths in whom was no blemish, and well favored, and skilful in all wisdom, and having knowledge and intelligence and strength, to stand as servants in the king's palace, and be taught the writing and the language of the Chaldaeans.
027	DAN	001	005	And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king's food, and of the wine which he drank; so nourishing them three years, that at the end thereof they might stand as servants before the king.
027	DAN	001	006	Now among these were, of the sons of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.
027	DAN	001	007	And the prince of the eunuchs gave them other names. To Daniel he gave the name of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abednego.
027	DAN	001	008	But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank; therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.
027	DAN	001	009	And God gave Daniel favor and kindness from the prince of the eunuchs.
027	DAN	001	010	And the prince of the eunuchs said to Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your meat and your drink; for he might see your faces in worse condition than the youths of your age; then shall ye make me endanger my head to the king.
027	DAN	001	011	Then said Daniel to the steward whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,
027	DAN	001	012	Try thy servants ten days, and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink.
027	DAN	001	013	Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenances of the youths that eat of the portion of the king's meat; and as thou seest, deal with thy servants.
027	DAN	001	014	And he consented to them in this matter, and tried them ten days.
027	DAN	001	015	And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the youths who ate the portion of the king's meat.
027	DAN	001	016	So the steward took away the portion of their meat, and the wine which they should drink, and gave them pulse.
027	DAN	001	017	And God gave these four youths knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom; and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.
027	DAN	001	018	And at the end of the days, when the king had commanded him to bring them before him, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.
027	DAN	001	019	And the king conversed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. Therefore they stood as servants before the king.
027	DAN	001	020	And in all matters of wisdom and understanding concerning which the king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the scribes and magicians that were in all his realm.
027	DAN	001	021	And Daniel lived even to the first year of Cyrus the king.
027	DAN	002	001	And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, on account of which his spirit was troubled, and his sleep went from him.
027	DAN	002	002	Then the king commanded to call the scribes, and the magicians, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldaeans, that they might show the king his dreams; and they came and stood before the king.
027	DAN	002	003	And the king said to them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit is troubled to know the dream.
027	DAN	002	004	And the Chaldaeans said to the king in Aramaean, O king, live forever! Tell thy servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation.
027	DAN	002	005	The king answered and said to the Chaldaeans: The word has gone from me. If ye will not make known to me the dream and the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill.
027	DAN	002	006	But if ye show the dream and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive from me gifts, and rewards, and great honor. Therefore show me the dream, and its interpretation!
027	DAN	002	007	They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation of it.
027	DAN	002	008	The king answered and said, I know of a certain, that ye seek to gain time, because ye see that the word hath gone forth from me.
027	DAN	002	009	For if ye do not make known to me the dream, this alone is your purpose, and ye have prepared lying and deceitful words to speak before me till the time be changed. Tell me therefore the dream, and I shall know that ye can show me the interpretation thereof.
027	DAN	002	010	The Chaldaeans answered before the king, and said: There is not a man upon the earth who can show what the king requireth; on which account no king, however great and powerful, hath asked such things of any scribe, or magician, or Chaldaean.
027	DAN	002	011	It is a hard thing which the king requireth, and there is none other that can show it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with men.
027	DAN	002	012	For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.
027	DAN	002	013	And the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain; and they sought Daniel and his fellows, to slay them.
027	DAN	002	014	Then Daniel answered with understanding and wisdom to Arioch, the captain of the king's guard, who was gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon.
027	DAN	002	015	He answered and said to Arioch, the king's captain, Why is the decree so hasty from the king? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel.
027	DAN	002	016	Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give him time, and that he would show the king the interpretation.
027	DAN	002	017	Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions;
027	DAN	002	018	that they would desire mercies of the God of heaven, concerning this secret; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish, with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.
027	DAN	002	019	Then was the secret revealed to Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.
027	DAN	002	020	Daniel spake and said: Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever! for wisdom and might are his.
027	DAN	002	021	And he changeth times and seasons; he removeth kings, and setteth up kings; he giveth wisdom to the wise, and knowledge to them that have understanding.
027	DAN	002	022	He revealeth deep and secret things; he knoweth what is in darkness, and light dwelleth with him.
027	DAN	002	023	I thank thee and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast made known to me now what we desired of thee; for thou hast now made known to us the king's matter.
027	DAN	002	024	Therefore Daniel went in to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon; he went and said thus to him: Destroy not the wise men of Babylon; bring me in before the king, and I will show to the king the interpretation.
027	DAN	002	025	Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus to him: I have found a man of the captives of Judah that will make known to the king the interpretation.
027	DAN	002	026	The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known to me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof?
027	DAN	002	027	Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, The secret which the king hath demanded, the wise men, the scribes, the magicians, the astrologers cannot show to the king;
027	DAN	002	028	but there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and maketh known to King Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the days to come. Thy dream and the visions of thy head upon thy bed were these.
027	DAN	002	029	Thy thoughts, O king, came into thy mind, what should come to pass hereafter; and he that revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to pass.
027	DAN	002	030	But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me through any wisdom which I have more than all the living, but to the end that the interpretation might be made known to the king, and that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart.
027	DAN	002	031	Thou, O king, sawest, and behold, a great image. This image, which was high and of surpassing brightness, stood before thee; and its form was terrible.
027	DAN	002	032	The head of this image was of fine gold; his breast and his arms of silver; his belly and his thighs of brass;
027	DAN	002	033	his legs of iron; his feet, part of iron and part of clay.
027	DAN	002	034	Thou sawest till a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet, that were of iron and clay, and broke them to pieces.
027	DAN	002	035	Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold broken to pieces together, and became like chaff from the summer threshing-floors, and the wind carried them away, so that no place was found for them; and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.
027	DAN	002	036	This is the dream, and now we will tell the interpretation of it before the king.
027	DAN	002	037	Thou, O king, art a king of kings; for the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom, power and strength and glory.
027	DAN	002	038	And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the birds of heaven hath he given into thy hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all. Thou art the head of gold.
027	DAN	002	039	And after thee shall arise another kingdom, inferior to thee; and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth.
027	DAN	002	040	And a fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron; forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things; even as iron, that breaketh all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise.
027	DAN	002	041	And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes part of potter's clay and part of iron, it shall be a divided kingdom; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay.
027	DAN	002	042	And as the toes of the feet were part of iron and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly broken.
027	DAN	002	043	And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves by marriage, but they shall not cleave to each other, even as iron is not mixed with clay.
027	DAN	002	044	But in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed; and the kingdom shall be left to no other people but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand forever;
027	DAN	002	045	even as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold. The great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter; and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.
027	DAN	002	046	Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odors to him.
027	DAN	002	047	The king answered Daniel and said, Of a truth, your God is the God of gods, and the Lord of kings, and the revealer of secrets, since thou couldst reveal this secret.
027	DAN	002	048	Then the king made Daniel a great man, and gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and chief of the governors over all the wise men of Babylon.
027	DAN	002	049	Then Daniel requested of the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego over the affairs of the province of Babylon; but Daniel was in the gate of the king.
027	DAN	003	001	Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was sixty cubits, and whose breadth was six cubits. He set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.
027	DAN	003	002	Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the satraps, the prefects, and the deputy governors, the chief judges, the treasurers, the judges, the counsellors, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.
027	DAN	003	003	Then the satraps, prefects, and deputy governors, the chief judges, treasurers, judges, counsellors, and all the rulers of the provinces were gathered together to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.
027	DAN	003	004	Then a herald cried aloud: To you it is commanded, O people, nations, and languages,
027	DAN	003	005	that at the time ye hear the sound of the horn, the pipe, the harp, the sambuck, the psaltery, the bagpipe, and all kinds of music, ye fall down and worship the golden image which Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up.
027	DAN	003	006	And whoso doth not fall down and worship shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.
027	DAN	003	007	Therefore at the time when all the people heard the sound of the horn, the pipe, the harp, the sambuck, the psaltery, and all kinds of music, all the people, the nations, and the languages fell down and worshipped the golden image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.
027	DAN	003	008	Wherefore at that time certain Chaldaeans came near, and accused the Jews.
027	DAN	003	009	They spake and said to King Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live forever!
027	DAN	003	010	Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man that shall hear the sound of the horn, the pipe, the harp, the sambuck, the psaltery, the bagpipe, and all kinds of music, shall fall down and worship the golden image;
027	DAN	003	011	and that whoso doth not fall down and worship shall be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.
027	DAN	003	012	Now there are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, these men, O king, have not regarded thee; they serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.
027	DAN	003	013	Then Nebuchadnezzar in rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Then they brought these men before the king.
027	DAN	003	014	Nebuchadnezzar spake and said to them, Was it by design, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego? Do ye not serve my gods, nor worship the golden image which I have set up?
027	DAN	003	015	Now if ye be ready that at the time ye hear the sound of the horn, the pipe, the harp, the sambuck, the psaltery, the bagpipe, and all kinds of music, ye fall down and worship the image which I have set up, well! but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is the God that shall deliver you out of my hands?
027	DAN	003	016	Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer thee in this matter.
027	DAN	003	017	Behold, our God, whom we serve, is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thy hand, O king!
027	DAN	003	018	But if not, be it known to thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.
027	DAN	003	019	Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. And he spake and commanded that they should heat the furnace seven times more than it was wont to be heated.
027	DAN	003	020	And he commanded the mightiest men in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.
027	DAN	003	021	Then these men were bound in their trousers, their under-garments, their mantles, and their other clothing, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.
027	DAN	003	022	And because the command of the king was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire killed those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.
027	DAN	003	023	And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.
027	DAN	003	024	Then Nebuchadnezzar, the king, was astonished, and rose up in haste, and spake, and said to his counsellors, Did we not cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said to the king, True, O king!
027	DAN	003	025	He answered and said, Behold, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt, and the appearance of the fourth is like a son of the gods.
027	DAN	003	026	Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace, and spake and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, ye servants of the Most High God, come forth! Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came forth out of the midst of the fire.
027	DAN	003	027	And the satraps, prefects, and deputy governors, and the counsellors of the king, being gathered together, saw these men, upon whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was a hair of their head singed, nor were their trousers changed, nor had the smell of fire passed on them.
027	DAN	003	028	Then Nebuchadnezzar spake and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants, that trusted in him, and disobeyed the command of the king, and gave up their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god except their own God!
027	DAN	003	029	Therefore I make a decree, that every people, nation, and language which speaks anything reproachful against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be cut in pieces, and its houses shall be made a dunghill; because there is no other God that can deliver in this manner.
027	DAN	003	030	Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the province of Babylon.
027	DAN	004	001	Nebuchadnezzar the king to all people, nations, and languages that dwell upon the whole earth. Peace be multiplied to you!
027	DAN	004	002	I have thought it good to show the signs and wonders which the Most High God hath wrought toward me.
027	DAN	004	003	How great are his signs, and how mighty are his wonders! His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion endureth from generation to generation.
027	DAN	004	004	I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at ease in my house, and flourishing in my palace.
027	DAN	004	005	There I saw a dream which made me afraid, and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me.
027	DAN	004	006	Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me; that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream.
027	DAN	004	007	Then came in the scribes, the magicians, the Chaldaeans, and the astrologers; and I told the dream before them; but they did not make known to me its interpretation.
027	DAN	004	008	But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name is Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods, and I told him the dream.
027	DAN	004	009	O Belteshazzar, chief of the scribes, since I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in thee, and no secret is too hard for thee, tell me the visions of my dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof.
027	DAN	004	010	The visions of my head were these. I saw, and behold a tree in the midst, whose height was very great.
027	DAN	004	011	The tree was large and strong, and its height reached to heaven, and it might be seen to the end of the whole earth.
027	DAN	004	012	The leaves thereof were fair, and the fruit abundant, and in it was food for all. The beasts of the field had shadow under it, and the birds of heaven dwelt in the boughs thereof, and all flesh was fed of it.
027	DAN	004	013	I saw, in the visions of my head upon my bed, and behold, a watcher, even a holy one, came down from heaven;
027	DAN	004	014	he cried aloud, and spake thus: Hew down the tree, and cut off its branches; shake off its leaves, and scatter its fruit; let the beasts go away from under it, and the birds from its branches.
027	DAN	004	015	Yet leave the stump of its roots in the earth, in bands of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and he shall be wet with the dew of heaven, and his portion shall be with the beasts in the grass of the field.
027	DAN	004	016	His heart shall be changed, and be no more that of a man, and a beast's heart shall be given him, and seven times shall pass over him.
027	DAN	004	017	By a decision of the watchers is the decree, and by a command of the holy ones is the sentence; to the intent that the living may know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdoms of men, and giveth them to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over them the lowest of men.
027	DAN	004	018	This dream I, King Nebuchadnezzar, saw, and do thou, O Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation thereof, forasmuch as all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known to me the interpretation; but thou art able, for the spirit of the holy gods is in thee.
027	DAN	004	019	Then Daniel, who was called Belteshazzar, was amazed for one hour, and his thoughts troubled him. The king spake and said, Belteshazzar, let not the dream or the interpretation thereof trouble thee. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, the dream be to them that hate thee, and the signification of it to thine enemies!
027	DAN	004	020	The tree which thou sawest, which was large and strong, whose height reached to heaven, and which might be seen by all the earth,
027	DAN	004	021	whose leaves were fair, and whose fruit abundant, and in which was food for all, under which all the beasts of the field dwelt, and upon whoso branches the birds of heaven had their lodging, —
027	DAN	004	022	it is thou, O king, who art become great and strong; for thy greatness is immense, and reacheth to heaven, and thy dominion to the end of the earth.
027	DAN	004	023	And whereas the king saw a watcher, even a holy one, coming down from heaven, and saying, Hew the tree down and destroy it, yet leave the stump of its roots in the earth, in bands of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field, and he shall be wet with the dew of heaven, and his portion shall be with the beasts of the field, till seven times pass over him;
027	DAN	004	024	this is the interpretation, O king, and this is the decree of the Most High, which is come upon my lord, the king;
027	DAN	004	025	they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and they shall let thee eat grass as oxen, and be wet with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over thee, till thou know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdoms of men, and giveth them to whomsoever he will.
027	DAN	004	026	And whereas it was commanded to leave the stump of the roots of the tree, thy kingdom shall be sure to thee after thou shalt have acknowledged that Heaven ruleth.
027	DAN	004	027	Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable to thee, and break off thy sins by righteousness, and thy iniquities by showing mercy to the poor; if it may be a lengthening out of thy tranquility.
027	DAN	004	028	All this came upon King Nebuchadnezzar.
027	DAN	004	029	At the end of twelve months, he was walking in the palace of the kingdom of Babylon;
027	DAN	004	030	and the king spake and said, Is not this the great Babylon which I have built for the seat of the kingdom by the might of my power and for the honor of my majesty?
027	DAN	004	031	While the word was in the king's mouth, there fell a voice from heaven: “To thee it is said, O Nebuchadnezzar! the kingdom is departed from thee.
027	DAN	004	032	And they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field; they shall make thee eat grass as oxen, and seven times shall pass over thee, until thou know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdoms of men, and giveth them to whomsoever he will.”
027	DAN	004	033	The same hour was the word fulfilled against Nebuchadnezzar, and he was driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hairs were grown like eagles' feathers, and his nails like birds' claws.
027	DAN	004	034	But at the end of the days, I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up my eyes to heaven, and my understanding returned to me, and I blessed the Most High, and I praised and honored Him that liveth forever, whose dominion is an everlasting dominion, and whose kingdom endureth from generation to generation.
027	DAN	004	035	And all the inhabitants of the earth are counted as nothing; and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth; and none can stay his hand, or say to him, What doest thou?
027	DAN	004	036	At the same time my reason returned to me, and also the glory of my kingdom, my honor, and my splendor returned to me; and my counsellors and my lords sought me; and I was established in my kingdom, and I received yet greater majesty.
027	DAN	004	037	Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honor the King of heaven; all whose works are truth and his ways justice; and those that walk in pride he is able to abase.
027	DAN	005	001	Belshazzar, the king gave a great feast to his thousands lords, and drank wine before the thousand.
027	DAN	005	002	Belshazzar, while he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple at Jerusalem; that the king and his princes, his wives and his concubines, might drink therein.
027	DAN	005	003	Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God at Jerusalem; and the king and his princes, his wives and his concubines, drank in them.
027	DAN	005	004	They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone.
027	DAN	005	005	In the same hour came forth fingers of a man's hand, and wrote over against the chandelier upon the plaster of the wall of the king's palace; and the king saw the hand that wrote.
027	DAN	005	006	Then the king's countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled him, so that the joints of his loins were loosened, and his knees smote one against the other.
027	DAN	005	007	The king cried aloud to bring in the magicians, the Chaldaeans, and the astrologers. And the king spake and said to the wise men of Babylon, Whoever shall read this writing, and show me the interpretation thereof, shall be clothed with purple, and have a chain of gold about his neck, and shall rule as the third in the kingdom.
027	DAN	005	008	Then all the king's wise men came in; but they could not read the writing, nor make known to the king its signification.
027	DAN	005	009	Then was King Belshazzar in great consternation, and his countenance was changed, and his lords were amazed.
027	DAN	005	010	Then the queen, on account of this affair of the king and his lords, came into the banquet-house; and the queen spake and said, O king, live forever! Let not thy thoughts terrify thee, nor let thy countenance be changed.
027	DAN	005	011	There is a man in thy kingdom in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of thy father, light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, were found in him; and the king Nebuchadnezzar, thy father, made him chief of the scribes, the magicians, the Chaldeans, and the astrologers, thy father, O king!
027	DAN	005	012	forasmuch as an excellent spirit and knowledge and understanding to interpret dreams, and to explain hard sentences, and solve difficult questions were found in him, in Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar; now let Daniel be called, and he will show the interpretation.
027	DAN	005	013	Then was Daniel brought in before the king. And the king spake and said to Daniel, Art thou that Daniel, of the captives of Judah, whom the king, my father, brought out of Judaea?
027	DAN	005	014	I have heard concerning thee, that the spirit of the gods is in thee, and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom are found in thee.
027	DAN	005	015	And now the wise men and the magicians have been brought in before me, that they might read this writing, and make known to me its signification; but they could not show the signification of the thing.
027	DAN	005	016	But I have heard of thee that thou canst give interpretations, and solve difficult questions. Now if thou canst read the writing and make known to me its signification, thou shalt be clothed with purple, and have a chain of gold about thy neck, and shalt rule as the third in the kingdom.
027	DAN	005	017	Then answered Daniel and said before the king, Let thy gifts be to thyself, and give thy rewards to another: yet I will read the writing to the king, and make known to him the signification.
027	DAN	005	018	O king, the Most High God gave to Nebuchadnezzar, thy father, a kingdom, and majesty, and glory, and honor.
027	DAN	005	019	And by reason of the majesty which he gave him, all people, nations, and languages trembled and feared before him; whom he would he slew, and whom he would he kept alive; whom he would he set up, and whom he would he put down.
027	DAN	005	020	But when his heart was lifted up, and his spirit hardened in pride, he was thrust down from his kingly throne, and his glory was taken from him.
027	DAN	005	021	And he was driven from the sons of men; and his heart became like the beasts, and his dwelling was with wild asses; he was fed with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven; till he knew that the Most High God ruled in the kingdoms of men, and set up over them whomsoever he would.
027	DAN	005	022	And thou, his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thy heart, though thou knewest all this;
027	DAN	005	023	but hast lifted thyself up against the Lord of heaven; and the vessels of his house have been brought before thee, and thou, and thy lords, thy wives, and thy concubines have drunk wine in them; and thou hast praised the gods of silver and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know; and the God in whose hand is thy breath, and whose are all thy ways, thou hast not honored.
027	DAN	005	024	Then was sent from him the hand, and this writing was written.
027	DAN	005	025	And this is the writing which was written: Numbered, Numbered, Weighed, and To be Divided.
027	DAN	005	026	And this is the interpretation of it. Numbered: God hath numbered thy kingdom, and made an end of it.
027	DAN	005	027	Weighed: Thou art weighed in the balances, and found wanting.
027	DAN	005	028	Divided: Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.
027	DAN	005	029	Then Belshazzar commanded, and they clothed Daniel with purple, and put a chain of gold about his neck, and made a proclamation concerning him that he should be third ruler in the kingdom.
027	DAN	005	030	In the same night was Belshazzar, the king of the Chaldaeans, slain;
027	DAN	005	031	and Darius the Mede took the kingdom, being about sixty-two years old.
027	DAN	006	001	It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom a hundred and twenty satraps, which should be over the whole kingdom,
027	DAN	006	002	and over them three presidents, of whom Daniel was one, that the satraps might give accounts to them, and the king might have no damage.
027	DAN	006	003	Then this Daniel was eminent above the presidents and satraps, because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm.
027	DAN	006	004	Then the presidents and satraps sought to find occasion against Daniel in relation to the kingdom; but they could find no occasion nor fault; because he was faithful, and no error nor fault was found in him.
027	DAN	006	005	Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, unless we find it against him concerning the law of his God.
027	DAN	006	006	Then these presidents and satraps rushed together to the king, and spake thus to him: King Darius, live forever!
027	DAN	006	007	All the presidents of the kingdom, the governors and the satraps, the counsellors and the prefects, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a firm decree, that whoever shall ask a petition of any god or man for thirty days, save of thee, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions.
027	DAN	006	008	Now, O king, establish the decree and sign the writing that it be not changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians which altereth not.
027	DAN	006	009	Wherefore King Darius signed the writing and the decree.
027	DAN	006	010	Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house, his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, and three times a day he kneeled upon his knees, and prayed and gave thanks before his God, as he had done before.
027	DAN	006	011	Then these men rushed together, and found Daniel praying and making supplication before his God.
027	DAN	006	012	Then they came near and spake before the king concerning the royal decree: Hast thou not signed a decree, that every man who shall ask a petition of any god or man within thirty days, save of thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions? The king answered and said, The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.
027	DAN	006	013	Then answered they and said before the king, Daniel, who is of the sons of the captives of Judah, regardeth not thee, O king, nor the decree which thou hast signed, but maketh his petition three times a day.
027	DAN	006	014	Then the king, when he heard these words, was much troubled, and set his heart to deliver him; and he labored till the going down of the sun to deliver him.
027	DAN	006	015	Then these men assembled before the king, and said to the king, Know, O king, that the law of the Medes and Persians is, that no decree or statute which the king establisheth may be changed.
027	DAN	006	016	Then the king commanded that they should bring Daniel and cast him into the den of lions. And the king spake and said to Daniel, May thy God, whom thou servest continually, deliver thee!
027	DAN	006	017	And a stone was brought and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords, that nothing concerning Daniel might be changed.
027	DAN	006	018	Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting, and suffered not the concubines to be brought to him; and his sleep went from him.
027	DAN	006	019	Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste to the den of lions.
027	DAN	006	020	And when he came to the den, he cried with a troubled voice to Daniel; and the king spake and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, has thy God, whom thou servest continually, been able to deliver thee from the lions?
027	DAN	006	021	Then said Daniel to the king, O king, live forever!
027	DAN	006	022	My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions' mouths, so that they have not hurt me; forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done no wrong.
027	DAN	006	023	Then was the king exceedingly glad, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he trusted in his God.
027	DAN	006	024	And the king commanded, and they brought those men who had accused Daniel, and cast them into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and the lions had the mastery of them, and broke all their bones before they came to the bottom of the den.
027	DAN	006	025	Then King Darius wrote to all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth: Peace be multiplied to you!
027	DAN	006	026	I make a decree, that in every government of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel; for he is the living God that endureth forever, and whose kingdom shall not be destroyed, and whose dominion shall endure to the end.
027	DAN	006	027	It is he that delivereth and rescueth, and worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in earth, who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.
027	DAN	006	028	This Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.
027	DAN	007	001	In the first year of Belshazzar, king of Babylon, Daniel saw a dream, and visions of his head upon his bed. Then he wrote the dream, and related the sum of the matters.
027	DAN	007	002	Daniel spake and said: —I saw in my vision by night, and behold, the four winds of heaven burst forth upon the great sea.
027	DAN	007	003	And four great beasts came up out of the sea, diverse one from another.
027	DAN	007	004	The first was like a lion, and had the wings of an eagle; I beheld till its wings were plucked from it, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made to stand upon its feet like a man, and a man's heart was given to it.
027	DAN	007	005	And behold, another beast, the second, like to a bear; and it stood up on one side, and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth; and they spake thus to it: Arise, devour much flesh!
027	DAN	007	006	After this I beheld, and lo, another, like a leopard, which had upon its back four wings of a bird; the beast also had four heads, and dominion was given to it.
027	DAN	007	007	After this I saw in the night visions, and behold, a fourth beast, dreadful, and terrible, and exceedingly strong; and it had great iron teeth; it devoured, and broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet, and it differed from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.
027	DAN	007	008	I gave heed to the horns, and behold, there came up among them another little horn, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots; and behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things.
027	DAN	007	009	I beheld, till thrones were placed, and an aged one seated himself, his garment white like snow, and the hair of his head like pure wool; his throne like a fiery flame, and its wheels like burning fire.
027	DAN	007	010	A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him; thousands of thousands ministered to him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him; the tribunal sat, and the books were opened.
027	DAN	007	011	I beheld; and because of the great words which the horn spake, I beheld till the beast was slain, and his body destroyed and given to the burning flame.
027	DAN	007	012	As to the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away, for the duration of their lives had been appointed for a season and a time.
027	DAN	007	013	I saw in the night visions, and behold, with the clouds of heaven came one like a son of man, and came to the aged one, and they brought him near before him.
027	DAN	007	014	And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages should serve him; his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom shall not be destroyed.
027	DAN	007	015	I Daniel was grieved in my spirit within me, and the visions of my head troubled me.
027	DAN	007	016	I came near to one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth concerning all this. So he told me, and made known to me the interpretation of the things.
027	DAN	007	017	These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall arise out of the earth.
027	DAN	007	018	Then shall the saints of the Most High receive the kingdom, and possess the kingdom forever, even for ever and ever.
027	DAN	007	019	Then I desired to know the truth concerning the fourth beast, which differed from all the others, exceedingly dreadful, whose teeth were of iron and his nails of brass, which devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with his feet;
027	DAN	007	020	and concerning the ten horns which were in his head, and the other which came up, and before which three fell, —even that horn which had eyes, and a mouth that spake very great things, and whose appearance was larger than that of his fellows.
027	DAN	007	021	I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints and prevailed against them,
027	DAN	007	022	until the aged one came, and judgment was rendered to the saints of the Most High, and the time came that the saints should possess the kingdom.
027	DAN	007	023	He spake thus: The fourth beast is a fourth kingdom upon the earth, which shall differ from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.
027	DAN	007	024	And the ten horns are ten kings, which shall arise out of this kingdom; and another shall arise after them; and he shall differ from the former, and shall subdue three kings.
027	DAN	007	025	And he will speak great words against the Most High, and will harass the saints of the Most High, and will resolve to change times and laws; and they shall be given into his hand a time, and times, and half a time.
027	DAN	007	026	But the tribunal shall sit, and his dominion shall be taken away, and consumed and destroyed forever.
027	DAN	007	027	And the sovereignty and dominion and power over all kingdoms under the whole heaven shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High; his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.
027	DAN	007	028	Here ended his words. As for me Daniel, my thoughts terrified me much, and my countenance changed; but I kept the matter in my heart.
027	DAN	008	001	In the third year of the reign of King Belshazzar, a vision appeared to me, to me, Daniel, after that which appeared to me at the first.
027	DAN	008	002	And I saw in a vision, and when I saw, I was in Shushan, in the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in a vision, and was by the river Ulai.
027	DAN	008	003	And I lifted up my eyes and saw, and behold, there stood before the river a ram, which had two horns; and the two horns were high, and one was higher than the other; and the higher came up last.
027	DAN	008	004	I saw the ram pushing westward and northward and southward, and no beast could stand before him, and none could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will and became great.
027	DAN	008	005	And I gave heed, and behold, a he-goat came from the west, over the face of the whole earth, without touching the ground; and the goat had a conspicuous horn between his eyes.
027	DAN	008	006	And he came to the ram which had two horns, which I had seen standing before the river, and ran against him in the fury of his power.
027	DAN	008	007	And I saw him come close to the ram, and he was enraged against him, and smote the ram, and broke in pieces his two horns; and there was no power in the ram to stand before him; and he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him; and none could deliver the ram out of his hand.
027	DAN	008	008	And the he-goat became exceedingly great; but when he became strong the great horn was broken, and instead of it grew up four conspicuous ones toward the four winds of heaven.
027	DAN	008	009	And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which became exceedingly great toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the beautiful land.
027	DAN	008	010	And it exalted itself even to the host of heaven, and some of the host and of the stars it cast down to the ground, and stamped upon them.
027	DAN	008	011	Yea, he magnified himself even to the Prince of the host, and the daily sacrifice did he take away from him, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.
027	DAN	008	012	And a host was placed over the daily sacrifice with impiety, and it cast down truth to the ground, and it accomplished its purpose and prospered.
027	DAN	008	013	And I heard a holy one speak; and another holy one said to the one that had spoken, To how long a time extendeth the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, and the impiety of the destroyer, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?
027	DAN	008	014	And he said to me, To two thousand and three hundred evenings and mornings; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.
027	DAN	008	015	And it came to pass, that when I Daniel saw the vision, I sought for the meaning; and behold, there stood one before me having the appearance of a man.
027	DAN	008	016	And I heard a man's voice between the banks of Ulai, which called and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.
027	DAN	008	017	And he came near where I stood; and when he came, I was afraid, and fell upon my face, and he said to me, Understand, O son of man! for this vision relateth to the time of the end.
027	DAN	008	018	But when he spake to me, I sank senseless upon my face to the ground; but he touched me, and lifted me up where I had stood.
027	DAN	008	019	And he said, Behold, I make known to thee what shall be in the latter time of the indignation; for [[the vision relateth]] to the time of the end.
027	DAN	008	020	The ram which thou sawest, having two horns, denoteth the kings of Media and Persia.
027	DAN	008	021	And the rough goat is the king of Greece; and the great horn between his eyes is the first king.
027	DAN	008	022	And as that was broken, and four arose in its place, four kingdoms shall arise out of the nation, but not with his power.
027	DAN	008	023	And toward the end of their reign, when the transgressors have filled up the measure of their iniquities, a king shall arise of a fierce countenance, and cunning in artifices.
027	DAN	008	024	And his power shall become mighty, but not by his own strength; and wonderfully will he destroy, and prosper, and accomplish his purposes, and he will destroy many, even the people of the holy ones.
027	DAN	008	025	And through his cunning will he cause fraud to prosper in his hand, and he will magnify himself in his heart, and he will destroy many in the midst of security, and against the Prince of princes will he stand up; but he shall be broken without hand.
027	DAN	008	026	And the vision of the evening and the morning, which was told thee, is true; but do thou seal up the vision, for it relates to many days.
027	DAN	008	027	And I Daniel fainted, and was sick some days; then I rose up and did the king's business; and I was astonished at the vision, but no one explained it.
027	DAN	009	001	In the first year of Darius, the son of Ahasuerus, of the race of the Medes, who became king over the realm of the Chaldaeans,
027	DAN	009	002	in the first year of his reign, I Daniel attentively considered in the Books the number of the years, concerning which the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah the prophet, that Jerusalem should remain in ruins till they were accomplished, namely, seventy years.
027	DAN	009	003	And I set my face toward God, the Lord, and made prayers and supplications, with fasting and sackcloth and ashes.
027	DAN	009	004	And I prayed to Jehovah, my God, and made my confession, and said, O Lord, the great and terrible God, who keepeth the covenant and mercy to them that love him and keep his commandments!
027	DAN	009	005	We have sinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from thy precepts and thy statutes.
027	DAN	009	006	Neither have we hearkened to thy servants, the prophets, who spake in thy name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land.
027	DAN	009	007	To thee, O Lord, belongeth righteousness, but to us confusion of face, as at this day; to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to all Israel, to those that are near and to those that are far off through all the countries whither thou hast driven them because of their trespass which they have trespassed against thee.
027	DAN	009	008	O Lord, to us belongeth confusion of face, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against thee.
027	DAN	009	009	Yet with the Lord our God is mercy and forgiveness. For we have rebelled against him,
027	DAN	009	010	and have not obeyed the voice of Jehovah our God, to walk in his laws, which he set before us by his servants, the prophets.
027	DAN	009	011	Yea, all Israel have transgressed thy law, and turned away, so as not to obey thy voice; therefore the curse is poured out upon us, and the oath that is written in the law of Moses, the servant of God, because we have sinned against him.
027	DAN	009	012	And he hath fulfilled his word which he spake against us, and against our judges who judged us, by bringing great calamity upon us; for under the whole heaven hath it not been done as hath been done to Jerusalem.
027	DAN	009	013	As it is written in the law of Moses, all this evil came upon us. For we made not our prayer to Jehovah our God, that we might turn from our iniquities, and give heed to thy truth.
027	DAN	009	014	Therefore hath Jehovah our God kept his mind upon the evil, and brought it upon us; for Jehovah our God is righteous in all his works which he doeth; for we obeyed not his voice.
027	DAN	009	015	And now, O Lord our God, that broughtest thy people forth from the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and madest thee a name such as it is at this day, we have sinned, we have done wickedly.
027	DAN	009	016	O Lord, according to all thy goodness, let thine anger and thy fury, I beseech thee, be turned away from thy city Jerusalem, thy holy mountain! for because of our iniquities, and the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and thy people are become a reproach to all that are about us.
027	DAN	009	017	Now, therefore, O our God, hear the prayer of thy servant, and his supplications, and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lord's sake!
027	DAN	009	018	O my God, incline thine ear, and hear! open thine eyes, and behold our desolations, and the city which is called by thy name! for we do not present our supplications before thee on account of our righteousness, but on account of thy great mercy.
027	DAN	009	019	O Lord, hear! O Lord, forgive! O Lord, hearken and do! Defer not, for thine own sake, O my God! For thy city and thy people are called by thy name.
027	DAN	009	020	And while I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin, and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before Jehovah my God, for the holy mountain of my God,
027	DAN	009	021	yea, while I was speaking in prayer, the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the former vision, came, weary with running, and reached me about the time of the evening oblation.
027	DAN	009	022	And he instructed me, and talked with me, and said: Daniel, I am now come forth to give thee understanding.
027	DAN	009	023	At the beginning of thy supplication a word went forth, and I am come to show it thee; for thou art greatly beloved; therefore give heed to the word, and consider the vision.
027	DAN	009	024	Seventy weeks are appointed for thy people, and for thy holy city, to complete the iniquity, and to fill up the measure of the sins, and to expiate the guilt, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal vision and prophet, and to anoint a holy of holies.
027	DAN	009	025	Know, therefore, and understand! From the going forth of the word that Jerusalem should be restored and built till an anointed one, a prince, are seven weeks; and during sixty-two weeks it shall be restored and built with streets and moats, yet in troublous times.
027	DAN	009	026	And after the sixty-two weeks shall an anointed one be cut off, and there shall not be to him [[a successor]]; and the city and the sanctuary shall be destroyed by the people of a prince that shall come, whose end will be as in a flood; and to the end shall be war, decreed desolations.
027	DAN	009	027	And he will establish a covenant with many for one week, and during half a week he will cause sacrifice and oblation to cease, and upon the wing of abominations shall come the destroyer, until decreed destruction be poured out on the destroyer.
027	DAN	010	001	In the third year of Cyrus, king of Persia, was a revelation made to Daniel, who was also called Belteshazzar; and the revelation is true, and relateth to long warfare. And he gave heed to the revelation, and had understanding of the vision.
027	DAN	010	002	In those days, I Daniel was mourning three full weeks.
027	DAN	010	003	I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine into my mouth, till three whole weeks were ended.
027	DAN	010	004	And in the four and twentieth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river Hiddekel,
027	DAN	010	005	I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, a certain man, clothed in linen garments, and his loins girded with gold of Uphaz.
027	DAN	010	006	His body was like chrysolite, and his face had the appearance of lightning, and his eyes were as torches of fire, and his arms and his feet like the appearance of polished brass, and the sound of his words was as the shout of a multitude.
027	DAN	010	007	And I Daniel alone saw the vision and the men who were with me saw not the vision; but a great terror fell upon them, and they fled to hide themselves.
027	DAN	010	008	Therefore I was left alone, and saw this great vision; and there remained no strength in me, and my color was changed upon me into a deadly paleness, and I retained no strength.
027	DAN	010	009	And I heard the sound of his words; and as I heard the sound of his words, I fell senseless upon my face, and my face toward the ground.
027	DAN	010	010	And behold, a hand touched me, and lifted me upon my knees and the palms of my hands.
027	DAN	010	011	And he said to me, Daniel, much-beloved man, give heed to the words which I speak to thee, and stand upright! for to thee am I now sent. And when he said this to me, I stood up trembling.
027	DAN	010	012	Then said he to me, Fear not, Daniel! for from the first day that thou didst set thy mind to understand, and to chasten thyself before thy God, thy words were heard, and I am come on account of thy words.
027	DAN	010	013	But the prince of the kingdom of Persia stood up against me one and twenty days; but lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I was left there victorious with the kings of Persia.
027	DAN	010	014	Now I am come to teach thee what shall befall thy people in the latter days; for the vision yet relates to distant days.
027	DAN	010	015	And when he had spoken these words to me, I set my face toward the ground, and was dumb.
027	DAN	010	016	And behold, one having the appearance of the sons of men touched my lips; then I opened my mouth and spake, and said to him that stood before me, O my lord, by the vision my pain came upon me, and I have no strength left.
027	DAN	010	017	And how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord? And now there remaineth no strength in me, neither is breath left in me.
027	DAN	010	018	Then one having the appearance of a man again touched me and strengthened me,
027	DAN	010	019	and said, Fear not, much-beloved man! peace be to thee! be strong, yea, be strong! And while he was speaking with me, I was strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak; for thou hast strengthened me.
027	DAN	010	020	Then he said, Knowest thou wherefore I have come to thee? And now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia, and I will go forth, and behold, the prince of Greece will come.
027	DAN	010	021	But I will show thee what is written in the book of truth. No one putteth forth his strength with me against them but Michael, your prince.
027	DAN	011	001	And I also, in the first year of Darius the Mede, stood up to confirm and strengthen him.
027	DAN	011	002	And now I will tell thee what is true. Behold, there shall arise yet three kings in Persia, and the fourth shall be far richer than they all; and, relying upon his riches, he shall stir up all against the realm of Greece.
027	DAN	011	003	But a mighty king shall arise, and rule with great dominion, and do according to his will.
027	DAN	011	004	But when he shall have arisen, his kingdom shall be broken in pieces, and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven; and not to his posterity, nor with the dominion with which he ruled; for his kingdom shall be plucked up, and divided amongst others besides those.
027	DAN	011	005	And the king of the South shall become strong; but one of his princes shall become stronger than he, and have dominion; his dominion shall be a great dominion.
027	DAN	011	006	And after some years they shall ally themselves with each other; and the daughter of the king of the South shall come to the king of the North, to make peace; but she shall not retain the power of giving aid; neither shall he stand, nor his aid; but she shall be given up, and they that caused her to go, and he that begat her, and he that received her in those times.
027	DAN	011	007	But from a shoot of her roots shall one arise in his place, who shall come to an army, and shall come against the fortresses of the king of the North, and shall deal with them according to his pleasure, and prevail against them.
027	DAN	011	008	And their gods, with their molten images, and their precious vessels of silver and of gold, shall he carry into captivity into Egypt; then shall he stand away for many years from the king of the North;
027	DAN	011	009	and he shall come against the kingdom of the king of the South, but he shall return into his own land.
027	DAN	011	010	But his sons shall be stirred up, and shall assemble a multitude of large forces; and one of them shall move onward, and overflow, and pass through, and shall again stir himself up to carry on the war even to his stronghold.
027	DAN	011	011	Then shall the king of the South be enraged, and shall come forth and fight with him, even with the king of the North; and shall lead forth a great multitude, and the multitude shall be given into his hand.
027	DAN	011	012	And the multitude shall be elated, and his heart shall be lifted up, and he shall cast down tens of thousands; but he shall not be strong.
027	DAN	011	013	For the king of the North shall return and raise up against him a multitude greater than the former, and shall steadily come after certain years with a great army and with great riches.
027	DAN	011	014	And in those times many will stand up against the king of the South; and violent men of thy people shall exalt themselves, so as to establish the vision, and shall fall.
027	DAN	011	015	And the king of the North shall come, and cast up a mound, and take a fortified city; and the arms of the South shall not withstand, neither his chosen men, neither shall there be any strength to withstand.
027	DAN	011	016	And he that cometh against him shall do according to his will, and none shall stand before him; and he shall stand in the beautiful land, and destruction shall be in his hand.
027	DAN	011	017	And he shall set his face to come with the strength of his whole kingdom, and shall make pacification with him; and he shall give him his daughter in marriage, to ruin his dominion. But it shall not succeed, neither shall it be for him.
027	DAN	011	018	After this he shall turn his face to the isles, and shall take many; but a commander shall put an end to his scorn; nay, shall cause his scorn to return upon himself.
027	DAN	011	019	Then shall he turn his face to the strongholds of his own land; and he shall stumble, and fall, and shall not be found.
027	DAN	011	020	Then shall arise in his place one who shall send an exacter of tribute through the glory of his kingdom; but within few days shall he be destroyed, neither by anger nor by battle.
027	DAN	011	021	And in his place shall arise a despised person, to whom they shall not give the honor of the kingdom; but in the midst of peace he shall come in and obtain the kingdom by flatteries.
027	DAN	011	022	And the forces of a flood shall be overwhelmed before him, and shall be broken in pieces; and even the prince that is allied with him.
027	DAN	011	023	For after making a league with him, he will practise deceit; for he will come up, and prevail with a small people.
027	DAN	011	024	In the midst of security shall he come into the fattest provinces of the land, and he shall do what his fathers never did, nor his fathers' fathers; he shall scatter among them prey, and spoil, and riches; and he shall form his devices against the strongholds, even to a set time.
027	DAN	011	025	And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the South, with a great army; and the king of the South shall be stirred up to battle with a very great and mighty army; but he shall not stand, for they shall form devices against him.
027	DAN	011	026	Even they that eat of his own food shall destroy him; and his army shall overflow, and many shall fall down slain.
027	DAN	011	027	And the hearts of both these kings shall be to do mischief; and at one table shall they speak lies; but it shall not prosper; for yet the end is for the appointed time.
027	DAN	011	028	Then shall he return into his land with great riches; and he will set his heart against the holy covenant, and he will execute his purposes, and return to his own land.
027	DAN	011	029	At the appointed time he shall again go against the South; but the second time it shall not be as at the first.
027	DAN	011	030	For the Chittaean ships shall come against him, and he shall be discouraged, and return, and be enraged against the holy covenant, and execute his purposes; and he shall again have an understanding with them that forsake the holy covenant.
027	DAN	011	031	And forces shall be raised by him, which shall pollute the sanctuary, the stronghold, and take away the daily sacrifice, and set up the abomination of the destroyer.
027	DAN	011	032	And such as do wickedly against the covenant will he lead to apostasy by flatteries; but the people that know their God shall be strong, and do exploits.
027	DAN	011	033	And they that have understanding among the people shall instruct many; but they shall fall by the sword, and by flame, by captivity, and by spoil, many days.
027	DAN	011	034	And whilst they fall they shall receive a little help, and many shall join themselves to them with flatteries.
027	DAN	011	035	And some of them of understanding shall fall, to try them, and to purify, and cleanse, even to the time of the end, for it is yet at the time appointed.
027	DAN	011	036	And the king shall do according to his will; and he will exalt himself and magnify himself against every god, and he will speak horrible things against the God of gods, and he will prosper until the indignation be accomplished; for that which is determined shall be done.
027	DAN	011	037	Neither will he regard the god of his fathers, nor the desire of women; nor will he regard any god, but he will magnify himself against all.
027	DAN	011	038	But in their place will he honor the god of strongholds, even the god whom his fathers knew not shall he honor with gold, and with silver, and with precious stones, and with jewels.
027	DAN	011	039	And he shall do his will against fenced strongholds with a strange god; whoever acknowledge him, to them he will give great honor, and give them dominion over many, and divide the land amongst them for a reward.
027	DAN	011	040	But at the time of the end shall the king of the South push at him, and the king of the North shall rush against him like a whirlwind with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall enter into the countries, and overflow them, and pass over them.
027	DAN	011	041	He shall also enter into the beautiful land, and multitudes shall be overthrown; but these shall escape out of his hand, Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the sons of Ammon.
027	DAN	011	042	He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries, and the land of Egypt shall not escape.
027	DAN	011	043	And he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt; and the Lybians and Ethiopians shall be in his train.
027	DAN	011	044	But tidings out of the East and out of the North shall trouble him, and he shall go forth with great fury to destroy and utterly to take away many.
027	DAN	011	045	And he shall pitch his palace-tents between the sea and the beautiful holy mountain; but he shall come to his end, and none shall help him.
027	DAN	012	001	And at that time shall Michael arise, the great prince that standeth up for the sons of thy people; and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that time; and at that time shall thy people be delivered, every one that is found written in the book.
027	DAN	012	002	And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame, to everlasting contempt.
027	DAN	012	003	And they that are wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn the many to righteousness, as the stars for ever and ever.
027	DAN	012	004	But thou, Daniel, shut up these words, and seal this book even to the time of the end. Many shall run eagerly through it, and much knowledge shall be gained.
027	DAN	012	005	And I Daniel looked, and behold, two others stood there, one on this side of the bank of the river, and the other on that side of the bank of the river.
027	DAN	012	006	And one of them said to the man clothed in linen, who was upon the waters of the river, How long shall it be to the end of these wonders?
027	DAN	012	007	And I heard the man clothed in linen, who was upon the waters of the river, and he lifted up his right hand and his left hand to heaven, and swore by Him that liveth forever, that in a time, times, and a half, even when the dispersion of a portion of the holy people should be at an end, all these things should be fulfilled.
027	DAN	012	008	And I heard but understood not; and I said, My lord, what is the latter end of these things?
027	DAN	012	009	And he said, Go thy way, Daniel, for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end.
027	DAN	012	010	Many shall be cleansed, and made white, and purified, and the wicked will do wickedly; and none of the wicked will understand, but the wise will understand.
027	DAN	012	011	And from the time when the daily sacrifice shall be taken away, and the abomination of the destroyer set up, there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days.
027	DAN	012	012	Happy is he that waiteth and cometh to a thousand three hundred and thirty-five days!
027	DAN	012	013	But go thou thy way even to the end; for thou shalt rest, and rise up to thy lot at the end of the days.

# BOOK	028	HOS	Hosea	Hosea
028	HOS	001	001	The word of Jehovah, which came to Hoses, the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam, the son of Joash, king of Israel.
028	HOS	001	002	The beginning of the word of Jehovah by Hosea. Jehovah said to Hosea: Go, and take thee a wife of lewdness, and children of lewdness; for the land hath committed great lewdness; it is false to Jehovah.
028	HOS	001	003	So he went, and took Gomer, the daughter of Diblaim; and she conceived and bore him a son.
028	HOS	001	004	And Jehovah said to him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little while, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu, and will bring the kingdom of the house of Israel to an end.
028	HOS	001	005	Yea, in that day will I break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.
028	HOS	001	006	And she conceived again, and bore a daughter. And God said to him, Call her name Unpitied; for I will no more have pity upon the house of Israel, but will surely take them away.
028	HOS	001	007	But upon the house of Judah will I have pity, and will save them by Jehovah their God; I will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, nor by horses, nor by horsemen.
028	HOS	001	008	Then she weaned her daughter Unpitied, and conceived, and bore a son.
028	HOS	001	009	And God said, Call his name Not-my-people. For ye are not my people, and I will not be your God.
028	HOS	001	010	Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured, or numbered; and in the place where it was said to them, Ye are not my people, there shall it be said to them, Ye are the sons of the living God.
028	HOS	001	011	Then shall the sons of Judah and the sons of Israel be gathered together, and shall appoint to themselves one head, and shall come up out of the land. For great shall be the day of Jezreel.
028	HOS	002	001	Call ye your brethren My-people; and your sisters Pitied.
028	HOS	002	002	Contend ye with your mother, contend! For she is not my wife, Nor am I her husband; That she put away lewdness from her face, And adultery from her breasts, Lest I strip her naked, And expose her, as when she was born;
028	HOS	002	003	Lest I make her as the desert, and like a parched land, And kill her with thirst.
028	HOS	002	004	Upon her sons also I will not have pity, For they are the sons of lewdness.
028	HOS	002	005	For their mother hath been guilty of lewdness; She that bore them hath brought upon herself shame; For she said, I will go after my lovers, Who give me my food and my water, My wool and my flax, my oil and my strong drink.
028	HOS	002	006	Therefore, behold, I will hedge up her way with thorns, And I will enclose her with a wall, So that she shall not find her paths.
028	HOS	002	007	When she followeth after her lovers, she shall not overtake them; When she seeketh them, she shall not find them. Then shall she say, I will go back to my former husband, For then it was better with me than now.
028	HOS	002	008	For she did not consider that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil, And multiplied silver unto her, And gold, of which they made images of Baal.
028	HOS	002	009	Therefore will I take back my corn in its time, And my new wine in its season, And I will take away my wool and my flax, Which covered her nakedness.
028	HOS	002	010	And now will I reveal her shame before the eyes of her lovers, And none shall deliver her out of my hand.
028	HOS	002	011	And I will cause all her joy to cease; Her feasts, and new moons, and sabbaths, And all her festal days.
028	HOS	002	012	I will destroy her vines, and her fig-trees, Of which she said, These are my hire, Which my lovers have given me; And I will make them a forest, And the wild beasts shall eat them.
028	HOS	002	013	I will punish her for the days of the Baals, When she burned incense to them, And decked herself with her rings and her jewels, And went after her lovers, And forgot me, saith Jehovah.
028	HOS	002	014	Therefore, behold, I will allure her, And will lead her to the desert, And will speak kindly to her;
028	HOS	002	015	And thence will I give her her vineyards, And the valley of Achor for a door of hope; And there shall she sing, as in the days of her youth! As in the day when she came up from the land of Egypt.
028	HOS	002	016	At that time, saith Jehovah, Thou shalt call me, MY HUSBAND; Thou shalt no more call me, MY BAAL;
028	HOS	002	017	For I will take away the name of the Baals out of her mouth, And their name shall no more be uttered.
028	HOS	002	018	At that time will I make for them a covenant With the beasts of the forest, and with the birds of heaven, And with the creeping things of the ground. The bow and the sword and the battle will I break from the land, And I will cause them to lie down in safety.
028	HOS	002	019	I will betroth thee to me forever; Yea, I will betroth thee to me in righteousness, and in justice, And in kindness, and in tender love.
028	HOS	002	020	Yea, I will betroth thee to me in faithfulness, And thou shalt know Jehovah.
028	HOS	002	021	At that time will I hear, saith Jehovah; I will hear the heavens; And they shall hear the earth,
028	HOS	002	022	And the earth shall hear the corn, and the new wine, and the oil, And they shall hear Jezreel.
028	HOS	002	023	And I will plant her for myself in the land; And I will have pity upon her that was called Unpitied; And I will say to them called Not-my-people, Thou art my people; And they shall say, Thou art my God.
028	HOS	003	001	And Jehovah said to me, Go again, love a woman that is loved by another, and is an adulteress; even as Jehovah loveth the sons of Israel, who turn themselves to other gods, and love raisin-cakes.
028	HOS	003	002	So I bought her for me for fifteen shekels of silver, and a homer and a half of barley.
028	HOS	003	003	And I said to her, Thou shalt wait for me many days; thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt not be with any man; so will I also wait for thee.
028	HOS	003	004	For the sons of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and without teraphim.
028	HOS	003	005	Afterward shall the sons of Israel return, and seek Jehovah their God, and David their king, and turn with fear to Jehovah and his goodness in future times.
028	HOS	004	001	Hear the word of Jehovah, ye sons of Israel! For Jehovah hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land; For there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land.
028	HOS	004	002	Perjury, and falsehood, and murder, And theft, and adultery have broken forth, And blood reacheth to blood.
028	HOS	004	003	Therefore shall the land mourn, And every one that dwelleth therein shall languish, Together with the beasts of the forest, and the birds of heaven; Yea, even the fishes of the sea shall perish.
028	HOS	004	004	Yet let no man rebuke, and let no man reprove; For thy people are like those that contend with the priest,
028	HOS	004	005	Therefore shalt thou Fall by day, And the prophet shall fall with thee by night, And I will destroy thy mother.
028	HOS	004	006	My people is destroyed for lack of knowledge; Since thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, so that thou shalt no more be my priest; Since thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I also will forget thy children.
028	HOS	004	007	As they have become great, so have they sinned against me; I will change their glory into shame.
028	HOS	004	008	They feed upon the sins of my people, And incline their hearts to their iniquity.
028	HOS	004	009	And it shall be, as with the people, so with the priest; I will punish them for their ways, And requite them for their doings.
028	HOS	004	010	They shall eat and shall not be satisfied; They shall commit fornication, and shall not increase, For they have left off giving heed to Jehovah.
028	HOS	004	011	Fornication and wine and new wine take away the understanding;
028	HOS	004	012	My people ask counsel of their stocks, And their staff revealeth to them. For the spirit of fornication causeth them to err; Yea, they commit fornication, forsaking their God.
028	HOS	004	013	On the tops of the mountains they sacrifice, And on the hills they burn incense, Under the oak, and the poplar, and the terebinth, Because their shade is pleasant. Therefore your daughters commit fornication, And your daughters-in-law commit adultery;
028	HOS	004	014	I will not punish your daughters, when they commit fornication, Nor your daughters-in-law, when they commit adultery; For ye yourselves go aside with harlots, And sacrifice with prostitutes; Therefore the people that hath not understanding shall fall.
028	HOS	004	015	Though thou play the harlot, O Israel, Yet let not Judah offend! Come ye not to Gilgal, Neither go ye up to Bethaven. And swear ye not, saying, As Jehovah liveth!
028	HOS	004	016	For like a refractory heifer is Israel become refractory, Therefore will Jehovah feed them, like a lamb in a wide place.
028	HOS	004	017	Ephraim is joined to idols; Let him alone!
028	HOS	004	018	When their carousal is over, They give themselves up to lasciviousness; Their rulers love shame.
028	HOS	004	019	The wind hath bound them up with its wings, And they shall be brought to shame on account of their sacrifices.
028	HOS	005	001	Hear ye this, O ye priests, And hearken, O house of Israel, And give ear, O house of the king! For judgment is coming upon you, Because ye have been a snare at Mizpah, And an outspread net upon Tabor.
028	HOS	005	002	By their sacrifices they commit deep transgression, And I will bring chastisement upon them all.
028	HOS	005	003	I know Ephraim, And Israel is not hidden from me; For thou committest fornication, O Ephraim, And Israel is defiled.
028	HOS	005	004	They will not frame their doings To return to their God; For a spirit of fornication is within them, And they have no regard to Jehovah.
028	HOS	005	005	The pride of Israel testifieth to his face; Therefore shall Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquity; Judah also shall fall with them.
028	HOS	005	006	With their flocks and with their herds shall they go to seek Jehovah, And shall not find him; He hath withdrawn himself from them.
028	HOS	005	007	They have been false to Jehovah, For they have begotten strange children; Now shall the new moon consume them with their possessions.
028	HOS	005	008	Blow ye the trumpet in Gibeah, And the cornet in Ramah; Cry aloud at Bethaven! Look behind thee, O Benjamin!
028	HOS	005	009	Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke; Among the tribes of Israel do I make known what is sure.
028	HOS	005	010	The princes of Judah are like them that remove the land mark; I will pour out my wrath upon them like water.
028	HOS	005	011	Ephraim is oppressed; he is crushed with punishment, Because he willingly walked after the decree.
028	HOS	005	012	I am as a moth to Ephraim, And as rottenness to the house of Judah.
028	HOS	005	013	When Ephraim saw his sickness, And Judah his wound, Then went Ephraim to the Assyrian, And Judah sent to the hostile king; But he will not be able to heal you, Nor will he cure you of your wound.
028	HOS	005	014	For I will be as a lion to Ephraim, And as a young lion to the house of Judah. I, even I, will tear, and will depart; I will take away, and none shall rescue.
028	HOS	005	015	I will go back to my place, Till they have suffered for their sin, and seek my face! In their affliction they will seek me early.
028	HOS	006	001	“Come, and let us return to Jehovah! For he hath torn, and he will heal us; He hath smitten, and he will bind us up.
028	HOS	006	002	After two days will he revive us, On the third day he will raise us up, And we shall live in his presence,
028	HOS	006	003	Let us, therefore, know him; Let us ever strive to know Jehovah, His coming forth is sure as the morning; He will come to us like the rain, Like the latter rain which watereth the earth.”
028	HOS	006	004	O Ephraim, what shall I do to thee? O Judah, what shall I do to thee? For your goodness is like the morning cloud, And like the early dew, which vanisheth away.
028	HOS	006	005	Therefore I have hewn them by the prophets, I have slain them by the words of my mouth, And my judgments have gone forth like the light.
028	HOS	006	006	For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice, And the knowledge of God rather than burnt-offerings.
028	HOS	006	007	But they, after the manner of men, have transgressed the covenant; Even therein have they dealt unfaithfully with me.
028	HOS	006	008	Gilead is a city of them that do iniquity; She is full of footsteps of blood.
028	HOS	006	009	As troops of robbers lying in wait for a man, so is the company of priests; They murder in the way to Shechem; Yea, they commit heinous wickedness.
028	HOS	006	010	I have seen a horrible thing in the house of Israel; There Ephraim committeth fornication, Israel is polluted.
028	HOS	006	011	For thee also, O Judah, a harvest is appointed.
028	HOS	007	001	When I was about to deliver my people from captivity, When I would have healed Israel, Then the iniquity of Ephraim was discovered, And the wickedness of Samaria; For they practise fraud, And the thief entereth in, And the band of robbers spoileth without.
028	HOS	007	002	And they think not in their hearts, That I remember all their wickedness. Now shall their doings encompass them; They are before my face.
028	HOS	007	003	With their wickedness they gladden the king, And with their falsehoods the princes; All of them are adulterers;
028	HOS	007	004	They are as an oven heated by the baker; He ceaseth to stir the fire, Until the dough which he hath kneaded be leavened.
028	HOS	007	005	On the feast-day of our king, the princes are sick with the heat of wine, And he stretcheth out his hand with revilers.
028	HOS	007	006	For they make ready their heart like an oven, while they lie in wait; All night the baker sleepeth; In the morning it gloweth like a flaming fire.
028	HOS	007	007	They all glow as an oven; They have devoured their judges; All their kings have fallen; And none among them calleth upon me.
028	HOS	007	008	Ephraim hath mixed himself with the nations; Ephraim is a cake not turned.
028	HOS	007	009	Strangers have devoured his strength, And he knoweth it not; Yea, gray hairs are sprinkled upon him, Yet he knoweth it not.
028	HOS	007	010	The pride of Israel testifieth to his face; Yet do not they return to Jehovah their God, Nor seek him, for all this.
028	HOS	007	011	Ephraim is like a silly dove, without understanding; They call upon Egypt; they go to Assyria.
028	HOS	007	012	When they go, I will spread my net over them; As birds of heaven will I bring them down. I will chastise them, as hath been proclaimed in their congregation.
028	HOS	007	013	Woe to them, for they have wandered from me! Destruction upon them, for they have rebelled against me! Though I myself would redeem them, they speak falsely to me.
028	HOS	007	014	They cry not to me from their heart, But howl upon their beds; For corn and wine they assemble themselves; They rebel against me.
028	HOS	007	015	I have chastened them; I have also strengthened their arms; Yet do they devise evil against me.
028	HOS	007	016	They return, but not to the Most High; They are like a deceitful bow; Their princes shall fall by the sword for the haughtiness of their tongues; This shall be their reproach in the land of Egypt.
028	HOS	008	001	Put the trumpet to thy mouth! Like an eagle cometh an enemy against the house of Jehovah, Because they have transgressed my covenant, And have rebelled against my law.
028	HOS	008	002	They shall say to me, My God, we know thee, we, thine Israel!
028	HOS	008	003	Israel hath cast away what is good; The enemy shall pursue him.
028	HOS	008	004	They have set up kings, but not by me; They have made princes, and I knew it not. Of their silver and their gold have they made themselves idols, That they may be brought to destruction.
028	HOS	008	005	An abomination is thy calf, O Samaria! Mine anger is kindled against them; How long will it be ere they can attain to purity!
028	HOS	008	006	For from Israel it came; The workman made it, and it is no God; Yea, into fragments shall the calf of Samaria be broken.
028	HOS	008	007	They have sown the wind, And they shall reap the whirlwind. They shall have no standing harvest; The ear shall yield no meal; If perchance it yield, strangers shall devour it.
028	HOS	008	008	Israel is swallowed up; Soon shall they become among the nations As a vessel which no one desireth.
028	HOS	008	009	For they have gone up to Assyria, Like a solitary wild-ass; Ephraim hireth lovers;
028	HOS	008	010	But though they hire among the nations, Soon will I gather the nations against them; Then shall they rest a little while from the burden of their king, and their princes!
028	HOS	008	011	Ephraim hath built many altars for sin, Therefore shall he have altars for sin.
028	HOS	008	012	Though I write for him many laws, They are accounted as a strange thing;
028	HOS	008	013	As to the sacrifices which they should offer me, they slay flesh and eat it; Jehovah hath no pleasure in them. Now will he remember their iniquity, And punish their sins; To Egypt shall they return.
028	HOS	008	014	For Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and builded palaces, And Judah hath multiplied fenced cities; But I will send a fire upon his cities, And it shall devour his palaces.
028	HOS	009	001	Rejoice not, O Israel, Exult not, like the nations! For thou committest fornication, forsaking thy God! Thou lovest hire on every corn-floor.
028	HOS	009	002	The floor and the vat shall not feed them, And the new wine shall deceive them.
028	HOS	009	003	They shall not dwell in the land of Jehovah; To Egypt shall Ephraim go back, And eat unclean things in Assyria.
028	HOS	009	004	They shall pour out no offerings of wine to Jehovah, Nor shall their sacrifices please him; They shall be to them as the bread of mourners; All that eat thereof shall be polluted. Their bread shall be for their own hunger; It shall not come into the house of Jehovah.
028	HOS	009	005	What will ye do in the festal day, In the day of the feast of Jehovah?
028	HOS	009	006	For, behold, they go forth from a wasted land; Egypt shall gather them; Memphis shall bury them; The precious places of their silver, Nettles shall possess them; Thorns shall spring up in their habitations.
028	HOS	009	007	The days of visitation are come; The days of retribution are come— Israel shall know that the prophet was foolish, That the man of the spirit was mad— For the greatness of` thy iniquity, and thy great hatred.
028	HOS	009	008	If Ephraim seek an answer from my God, The prophet is as the snare of the fowler in all his ways, A net in the house of his God.
028	HOS	009	009	They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the days of Gibeah; He will remember their iniquity; He will requite their sins.
028	HOS	009	010	I found Israel as grapes in the wilderness; As the early fruit on the fig-tree, at its first time of bearing, I saw your fathers. But they went to Baal Peor, And separated themselves to shame, And had abominable idols according to their love.
028	HOS	009	011	The glory of Ephraim shall fly away as a bird; They shall not bring forth, nor bear in the womb, nor conceive;
028	HOS	009	012	Yea, if they bring up children, I will utterly bereave them; Yea, woe to them when I depart from them!
028	HOS	009	013	I have seen Ephraim planted, like Tyre, in a rich pasture, Yet shall Ephraim bring out his children to the murderer.
028	HOS	009	014	Give them, O Jehovah! What wilt thou give them? Give them a miscarrying womb, And dry breasts!
028	HOS	009	015	All their wickedness is in Gilgal; Yea, there have I hated them for the wickedness of their doings; I will drive them from my house; I will love them no more; All their princes are revolters.
028	HOS	009	016	Ephraim is smitten; Their root is dried up; they shall bear no fruit; Yea, though they should beget children, I will destroy the beloved fruit of the womb.
028	HOS	009	017	My God shall cast them away, Because they have not hearkened to him, And they shall be wanderers among the nations.
028	HOS	010	001	Israel is a luxuriant vine, That bringeth forth fruit; But according to the abundance of his fruit hath he abounded in altars; According to the goodness of his land hath he made goodly images.
028	HOS	010	002	Their heart is divided; now shall they suffer for it; He will break down their altars, And destroy their images.
028	HOS	010	003	For soon shall they say, We have no king, Because we fear not Jehovah; What can a king do for us?
028	HOS	010	004	They utter empty words, Swearing falsely, making covenants, And now judgment springeth up, as hemlock in the furrows of the field.
028	HOS	010	005	For the calf of Bethaven shall the inhabitants of Samaria be in fear; Yea, its people shall grieve for it, And its priests shall tremble for it, Because its glory has departed from it.
028	HOS	010	006	It shall be carried to Assyria, As a present to the hostile king. Ephraim shall be covered with confusion, And Israel shall be ashamed of his doings,
028	HOS	010	007	Samaria shall be brought to destruction; Her king shall be as a twig upon the waters.
028	HOS	010	008	The high places of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed; The thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars. And they shall say to the mountains, Cover us! And to the hills, Fall on us!
028	HOS	010	009	More than in the days of Gibeah hast thou sinned, O Israel! There they stood; The battle in Gibeah against the sons of iniquity did not overtake them.
028	HOS	010	010	Now will I chastise them according to my pleasure, And the nations shall be gathered together against them, When I shall bind them for their two iniquities.
028	HOS	010	011	Ephraim is a trained heifer, that loveth to tread out the corn; But I will lay the yoke upon her fair neck; I will cause Ephraim to draw, Judah shall plough, Jacob shall harrow.
028	HOS	010	012	Sow for yourselves to righteousness, and ye shall reap according to your piety; Break up your fallow ground; For it is a time to seek Jehovah, Till he come and rain righteousness upon you.
028	HOS	010	013	Ye plough wickedness, ye shall reap injustice; Ye shall eat the fruit of falsehood. Because thou trustest in thy way, in the multitude of thy mighty men,
028	HOS	010	014	There shall arise a tumult among thy people, And all thy fortresses shall be destroyed, As Shalman destroyed Betharbel in the day of battle, When the mother was dashed in pieces with her children.
028	HOS	010	015	Such things shall Bethel bring upon you Because of your great wickedness. In the morning shall the king of Israel be destroyed.
028	HOS	011	001	When Israel was a child, I loved him, And called my son out of Egypt,
028	HOS	011	002	But they turned away from those that called them. They sacrificed to images of Baal; They burned incense to idols.
028	HOS	011	003	I helped Ephraim to go, Yea, I took them up in my arms; Yet they marked not that I healed them.
028	HOS	011	004	I drew them with human cords, with bands of love; I was to them as those who lift up the yoke from their jaws; I dealt gently with them, and gave them food.
028	HOS	011	005	They shall no more go down to Egypt; For the Assyrian shall be their king, Because they refuse to return to me.
028	HOS	011	006	The sword shall fall upon their cities, It shall consume their bars, and devour Because of their devices.
028	HOS	011	007	For my people persevere in turning away from me; Though they are called to the Most High, None will exalt him.
028	HOS	011	008	How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? How shall I abandon thee, Israel? How shall I make thee as Admah? How shall I set thee as Zeboim? My heart is changed within me; Yea, my compassion is kindled.
028	HOS	011	009	I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger; I will not again destroy Ephraim; For I am God, and not man, The Holy One in the midst of thee, And I will not come in anger.
028	HOS	011	010	They shall walk after Jehovah, when he shall roar like a lion, When he shall roar, then shall their sons hasten from the west;
028	HOS	011	011	They shall hasten as a bird from Egypt, And as a dove from the land of Assyria, And I will place them in their houses, saith Jehovah.
028	HOS	011	012	Ephraim compasseth me about with falsehood, And the house of Israel with deceit; Judah also is inconstant toward God, Toward the holy and faithful one.
028	HOS	012	001	Ephraim feedeth on wind, and followeth after the east wind; Every day he multiplieth falsehood and violence; They make a league with Assyria, And oil is carried into Egypt.
028	HOS	012	002	Therefore Jehovah hath a controversy with Judah. And he will punish Jacob for his ways, And requite him according to his doings.
028	HOS	012	003	In the womb he took his brother by the heel, And in his strength he contended with God;
028	HOS	012	004	Yea, he contended with the angel, and prevailed; He wept, and made supplication to him. At Bethel he found him, And there he spake with us.
028	HOS	012	005	And Jehovah, the God of hosts, Jehovah is his name.
028	HOS	012	006	Therefore turn thou to thy God; Observe mercy and justice, And hope in thy God always!
028	HOS	012	007	He is a Canaanite; in his hands are the balances of deceit; He loveth to oppress.
028	HOS	012	008	Yet Ephraim saith, Lo, I have become rich; I have found myself substance; In all my earnings can be found no transgression in which there is guilt.
028	HOS	012	009	Yet I, Jehovah, have been thy God from the land of Egypt; I will again cause thee to dwell in tents, as in the days of the solemn feast.
028	HOS	012	010	I have also spoken to the prophets, And I have given many visions, And by the prophets I have used similitudes.
028	HOS	012	011	Behold, Gilead is full of iniquity; Surely they have become corrupt; In Gilgal they sacrifice oxen, And their altars are like the heaps in the furrows of the field.
028	HOS	012	012	Jacob fled into the country of Syria, And Israel served for a wife, And for a wife he kept sheep.
028	HOS	012	013	By a prophet Jehovah brought up Israel out of Egypt, And by a prophet was he preserved.
028	HOS	012	014	Ephraim hath provoked his Lord most bitterly; Therefore will he leave his blood upon him, And recompense to him his reproach.
028	HOS	013	001	Once when Ephraim spake, there was trembling; he was exalted in Israel; But he offended through Baal, and died.
028	HOS	013	002	And now they sin more and more, And have made to themselves molten images; Of their silver by their skill have they made idols; All of it is the work of artificers. They say concerning them, Whoever will sacrifice, let him kiss the calves!
028	HOS	013	003	Therefore shall they be as the morning cloud, And as the early dew, which passeth away; As chaff driven with a whirlwind from the thrashing-floor, And as smoke from the chimney.
028	HOS	013	004	Yet I, Jehovah, have been thy God from the land of Egypt, And thou hast known no God but me; Yea, there was no saviour besides me.
028	HOS	013	005	I cared for thee in the desert, In the land of great drought.
028	HOS	013	006	As they were fed, so they were filled; They were filled, and their heart was lifted up; Therefore they forgot me.
028	HOS	013	007	Therefore have I become to them as a lion; As a leopard I watch for them in the way;
028	HOS	013	008	I will meet them as a bear bereaved of her whelps, And I will rend the caul of their heart, And there will I devour them as a lioness; The wild beast shall tear them.
028	HOS	013	009	It hath been thy destruction, O Israel, That against me, against thy help, thou hast rebelled!
028	HOS	013	010	Where is now thy king? Let him save thee in all thy cities! And where thy judges, In regard to whom thou saidst, Give me a king and princes!
028	HOS	013	011	I gave thee a king in mine anger, And I have taken him away in my wrath;
028	HOS	013	012	the iniquity of Ephraim is treasured up; His guilt is laid up in store.
028	HOS	013	013	The pangs of a travailing woman shall come upon him; He is an unwise son, For else would he not tarry long in the place of the breaking forth of children.
028	HOS	013	014	I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death; O death, where is thy plague? O grave, where is thy destruction? Repentance is hidden from mine eyes.
028	HOS	013	015	Though he be fruitful among his brethren, An east wind shall come, A wind of Jehovah shall come up from the desert, And his spring shall become dry, And his fountain shall be dried up, And the treasure of all his pleasant vessels shall be spoiled.
028	HOS	013	016	Samaria shall suffer for her guilt, For she hath rebelled against her God. They shall fall by the sword; Their infants shall be dashed in pieces, And their women with child shall be ripped up.
028	HOS	014	001	Return, O Israel, to Jehovah thy God; For thou hast fallen by thine iniquity.
028	HOS	014	002	Take with you words, And return to Jehovah, saying, “Forgive all our iniquity, and receive us graciously, And we will render to thee the sacrifices of our lips!
028	HOS	014	003	Assyria shall not help us; We will not ride on horses; And no more will we say to the work of our hands, Ye are our Gods! For from thee the fatherless obtaineth mercy.”
028	HOS	014	004	“I will heal their rebellion; I will love them freely; For my anger is turned away from them.
028	HOS	014	005	I will be as the dew to Israel; He shall blossom as the lily, And strike his roots like Lebanon.
028	HOS	014	006	His sprouts shall spread forth, And his beauty shall be as the olive-tree, And his fragrance as Lebanon.
028	HOS	014	007	They that dwell under his shadow Shall revive as the corn; They shall shoot forth as the vine; Their name shall be like the wine of Lebanon.
028	HOS	014	008	Ephraim shall say, What have I more to do with idols? I will hear him; I will care for him; I will be like a green cypress-tree; From me shall thy fruit be found.”
028	HOS	014	009	Who is wise, that he may understand these things, Prudent, that he may know them? For the ways of Jehovah are right, And the righteous walk in them; But in them transgressors stumble.

# BOOK	029	JOE	Joel	Joel
029	JOE	001	001	The word of Jehovah, which came to Joel, the son of Pethuel.
029	JOE	001	002	Hear this, ye old men; Give ear, all ye inhabitants of the land! Hath such a thing happened in your days, Or even in the days of your fathers?
029	JOE	001	003	Tell ye your children of it, And let your children tell their children, And their children another generation!
029	JOE	001	004	That which the gnawing-locust left hath the swarming-locust eaten, And that which the swarming-locust left hath the licking-locust eaten, And that which the licking-locust left hath the consuming-locust eaten.
029	JOE	001	005	Awake, ye drunkards, and weep! Howl, all ye drinkers of wine, For the new wine, which is snatched from your mouths!
029	JOE	001	006	For a nation hath come up on my land, Strong, and not to be numbered; Their teeth are the teeth of the lion; They have the jaw-teeth of the lioness.
029	JOE	001	007	They have made my vine a desolation, And my fig-tree a broken branch; They have made it quite bare and cast it away; The branches thereof are made white.
029	JOE	001	008	Lament ye, like a bride, Clothed in sackcloth for the husband of her youth!
029	JOE	001	009	The flour-offering and the drink-offering are cut off from the house of Jehovah; The priests, the servants of Jehovah mourn.
029	JOE	001	010	The field is laid waste; The ground mourneth, For the corn is laid waste; The new wine is dried up; The oil languisheth.
029	JOE	001	011	Lament, O ye husbandmen, Howl, O ye vine-dressers, For the wheat and the barley, For the harvest of the field hath perished!
029	JOE	001	012	The vine is dried up, And the fig-tree languisheth; The pomegranate, the palm-tree, and the apple-tree, —All the trees of the field, are withered; Yea, joy is withered away from the sons of men.
029	JOE	001	013	Gird yourselves with sackcloth and mourn, ye priests! Howl, ye ministers of the altar! Come, lie all night in sackcloth, ye ministers of my God, For the flour-offering and the drink-offering are withholden from the house of your God!
029	JOE	001	014	Appoint ye a fast, proclaim a solemn assembly! Gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land Into the house of Jehovah, your God, And cry unto Jehovah!
029	JOE	001	015	Alas, alas the day! For the day of Jehovah is near; Even as destruction from the Almighty doth it come.
029	JOE	001	016	Is not our food cut off from before our eyes, Yea, joy and gladness from the house of our God?
029	JOE	001	017	The seeds are rotten under their clods, The storehouses are laid desolate, the garners are destroyed; For the corn is withered.
029	JOE	001	018	How do the beasts groan, How do the herds of oxen wander perplexed, Having no pasture! The flocks of sheep also are destroyed.
029	JOE	001	019	To thee, O Jehovah, do I call, For a fire hath devoured the pastures of the desert, And a flame hath burned all the trees of the field!
029	JOE	001	020	The beasts of the field, also, cry unto thee, For the streams of water are dried up, And a fire hath devoured the pastures of the desert!
029	JOE	002	001	Blow ye the trumpet in Zion; Sound an alarm in my holy mountain! Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble! For the day of Jehovah cometh, for it is near!
029	JOE	002	002	A day of darkness, and gloominess, A day of clouds, and thick darkness. As the morning light spreadeth itself upon the mountains, There cometh a numerous people and a strong; Like them there have been none of old time, And after them there shall not be, Even to the years of many generations.
029	JOE	002	003	A fire devoureth before them, And behind them a flame burneth; The land is as the garden of Eden before them. And behind them a desolate wilderness! Yea, nothing escapeth them.
029	JOE	002	004	Their appearance is like the appearance of horses, And like horsemen do they run;
029	JOE	002	005	Like rattling chariots they leap on the tops of the mountains; Like the crackling flame of fire, which devoureth stubble; Like a mighty host set in battle array.
029	JOE	002	006	Before them the people tremble, And all faces gather blackness.
029	JOE	002	007	They run like mighty men; They climb the wall like warriors; They march every one on his way; They change not their paths.
029	JOE	002	008	One doth not thrust another; They march every one in his path, And though they rush among weapons, they are not wounded.
029	JOE	002	009	They run through the city; They run upon the wall; They go up into the houses; They enter in at the windows, like a thief.
029	JOE	002	010	The earth quaketh before them, And the heavens tremble; The sun and the moon are darkened, And the stars withdraw their shining.
029	JOE	002	011	Jehovah uttereth his voice before his army; For very great is his host; Yea, it is mighty, executing his word; The day of Jehovah is great, and very terrible; Who shall be able to bear it?
029	JOE	002	012	Yet even now, saith Jehovah, Turn ye to me with all your heart, With fasting, with weeping, and with mourning!
029	JOE	002	013	And rend your hearts, and not your garments, And turn to Jehovah your God, For he is gracious and merciful, Slow to anger, and of great kindness, And repenteth of a threatened evil.
029	JOE	002	014	Who knoweth but he will turn and repent, And leave a blessing behind him, Even a flour-offering and a drink-offering for Jehovah your God.
029	JOE	002	015	Blow ye the trumpet in Zion; Appoint yea fast; proclaim a solemn assembly!
029	JOE	002	016	Gather the people; appoint a congregation; Assemble the elders; Gather the children and the sucklings! Let the bridegroom come forth from his chamber, And the bride from her nuptial bed!
029	JOE	002	017	Let the priests, the servants of Jehovah, Weep between the porch and the altar, And say, Spare thy people, O Jehovah, And give not thine inheritance to reproach, And to be a by-word to the nations! Why should they say among the nations, Where is their God?
029	JOE	002	018	Then will Jehovah be zealous for his land, And have compassion on his people,
029	JOE	002	019	Yea, Jehovah will answer, and say to his people, Behold, I will send you corn, And new wine, and oil, and ye shall be satisfied therewith; And I will no more make you a reproach among the nations.
029	JOE	002	020	I will remove far from you the northern host, And I will drive it into a dry and desolate land; Its van toward the Eastern sea, And its rear toward the Western sea. And its scent shall come up, And its ill savor shall come up, Because it hath done great things.
029	JOE	002	021	Fear not, O land, exult and rejoice, For Jehovah hath done great things!
029	JOE	002	022	Fear not, O ye beasts of the field, For the pastures of the desert spring up, For the tree beareth its fruit; The fig-tree and the vine yield their strength!
029	JOE	002	023	And, O ye sons of Zion, exult, And rejoice in Jehovah your God! For he giveth you the former rain in just measure, And causeth showers to come down upon you, Even the former rain, and the latter rain, as aforetime.
029	JOE	002	024	And the threshing-floors shall be full of wheat, And the vats shall overflow with new wine and oil.
029	JOE	002	025	And I will restore to you the years Which the swarming-locust hath eaten, The licking-locust, the consuming-locust, and the gnawing-locusts, My great army, which I sent among you.
029	JOE	002	026	Ye shall eat in plenty, and be satisfied, And praise the name of Jehovah your God, Who hath dealt wondrously with you; And my people shall never be put to shame.
029	JOE	002	027	Ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, And that I am Jehovah, your God, and none else; And my people shall never be put to shame.
029	JOE	002	028	And it shall come to pass afterward, That I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; And your sons and your daughters shall prophesy; Your old men shall dream dreams, Your young men shall see visions.
029	JOE	002	029	Upon the men-servants also, and upon the handmaids, Will I pour out my spirit in those days.
029	JOE	002	030	And I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth; Blood and fire, and pillars of smoke.
029	JOE	002	031	The sun shall be turned into darkness, And the moon into blood, Before the day of Jehovah cometh, The great and the terrible day. Then whoever calleth on the name of Jehovah shall be delivered;
029	JOE	002	032	For upon mount Zion, and in Jerusalem, shall be deliverance, As Jehovah hath spoken; And among the remnant, whom Jehovah shall call.
029	JOE	003	001	For behold, in those days and at that time, When I shall bring back the captives of Judah and Jerusalem,
029	JOE	003	002	I will assemble all the nations, And will bring them down it to the valley of Jehoshaphat, And there will I contend with them for my people and inheritance, Israel; Because they scattered them among the nations, And divided my land among themselves.
029	JOE	003	003	Yea, they cast lots for my people, And gave a boy for a harlot, And sold a damsel for wine to drink.
029	JOE	003	004	What have ye to do with me, O Tyre and Sidon, And all the borders of Philistia? Will ye retaliate on me? Or will ye do anything against me? Swiftly and speedily will I bring back your doings upon your own head.
029	JOE	003	005	Ye have taken my silver and my gold, And have carried into your palaces my precious, goodly things;
029	JOE	003	006	The sons also of Judah, and the sons of Jerusalem, Ye have sold to the Grecians, That ye might remove them far from their border.
029	JOE	003	007	Behold, I will raise them out of the place whither ye have sold them, And I will return your injury upon your own head;
029	JOE	003	008	I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the sons of Judah, And they shall sell them to the Sabeans, to a nation afar off; For Jehovah hath spoken it.
029	JOE	003	009	Proclaim ye this among the nations: “Prepare war! Stir up the mighty ones! Let all the warriors draw near; let them come up!”
029	JOE	003	010	Beat your ploughshares into swords, And your pruning-hooks into spears; Let the weak say, I am strong!
029	JOE	003	011	Assemble yourselves and come, all ye nations round about; Gather yourselves together! Thither, O Jehovah, bring down thy mighty ones!
029	JOE	003	012	Let the nations rise and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat! For there will I sit to judge all the nations around.
029	JOE	003	013	Put ye in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe; Come and tread, for the wine-press is full; The vats overflow; For their wickedness is great!
029	JOE	003	014	The multitudes, the multitudes in the valley of judgment! For the day of Jehovah is near in the valley of judgment.
029	JOE	003	015	The sun and the moon are darkened, And the stars withdraw their shining.
029	JOE	003	016	Jehovah also will roar from Zion, And utter his voice from Jerusalem; The heavens and the earth shall shake. But Jehovah will be a refuge to his people! A strong-hold to the sons of Israel.
029	JOE	003	017	Then shall ye know that I am Jehovah your God, Dwelling in Zion, my holy mountain; And Jerusalem shall be holy; Strangers shall pass through her no more.
029	JOE	003	018	In that day shall the mountains drop down new wine, And the hills shall flow with milk. And all the streams of Judah shall flow with water. A fountain shall come forth from the house of Jehovah, That shall water the valley of Shittim.
029	JOE	003	019	Egypt shall be a waste, And Edom a desolate wilderness, For their violence against the sons of Judah; For they shed innocent blood in their land.
029	JOE	003	020	But Judah shall be inhabited for ever, And Jerusalem from generation to generation.
029	JOE	003	021	And I will avenge their blood, which I have not avenged, And Jehovah will dwell upon Zion.

# BOOK	030	AMO	Amos	Amos
030	AMO	001	001	The words of Amos, one of the shepherds of Tekoa, which he prophesied concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam, the son of Joash, king of Israel, two years before the earth quake. He said: —
030	AMO	001	002	Jehovah will roar from Zion, And utter his voice from Jerusalem; The habitations of the shepherds shall mourn, And the top of Carmel shall wither.
030	AMO	001	003	Thus saith Jehovah; For three transgressions of Damascus, And for four, will I not turn away its punishment; For they thrashed Gilead with thrashing-wains of iron.
030	AMO	001	004	I will send a fire upon the house of Hazael, Which shall devour the palaces of Benhadad.
030	AMO	001	005	I will also break the bar of Damascus, And I will destroy the inhabitant from the valley of Aven, And him that holdeth the sceptre from Beth-Eden, And the people of Syria shall be led captive to Kir: Jehovah hath said it.
030	AMO	001	006	Thus saith Jehovah: For three transgressions of Gaza, And for four, I will not turn away its punishment; For they led captive all that fell into their hands, And delivered them up to Edom.
030	AMO	001	007	But I will send a fire upon the wall of Gaza, Which shall devour her palaces.
030	AMO	001	008	And I will destroy the inhabitant from Ashdod, And him that holdeth the sceptre from Ashkelon; And I will turn my hand against Ekron, And the residue of the Philistines shall perish. The Lord, Jehovah, hath said it.
030	AMO	001	009	Thus saith Jehovah: For three transgressions of Tyre, And for four, will I not turn away its punishment; Because they delivered up all their captives to Edom, And remembered not the brotherly covenant.
030	AMO	001	010	But I will send a fire on the wall of Tyre, Which shall devour her palaces.
030	AMO	001	011	Thus saith Jehovah: For three transgressions of Edom, And for four, will I not turn away his punishment; For he pursued his brother with the sword, And cast off all pity, And his anger tore perpetually; Yea, he kept his wrath forever.
030	AMO	001	012	But I will send a fire upon Teman. Which shall devour the palaces of Bozrah.
030	AMO	001	013	Thus saith Jehovah: For three transgressions of the children of Ammon, And for four, will I not turn away their punishment; For they ripped up the women with child of Gilead, That they might enlarge their border.
030	AMO	001	014	But I will kindle a fire on the wall of Rabbah, Which shall devour her palaces, Amid the war-shout in the day of battle, In a whirlwind in the day of the storm.
030	AMO	001	015	Their king shall go into captivity, He and his princes together, saith Jehovah.
030	AMO	002	001	Thus saith Jehovah: For three transgressions of Moab, And for four, will I not turn away his punishment; For he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime!
030	AMO	002	002	But I will send a fire on Moab, Which shall devour the palaces of Kirioth; And Moab shall die amid tumults, Amid the war-shout, and the sound of the trumpet.
030	AMO	002	003	I will destroy the judge from the midst of him, And slay all the princes with him, saith Jehovah.
030	AMO	002	004	Thus saith Jehovah: For three transgressions of Judah, And for four, will I not turn away their punishment; For they have despised the law of Jehovah, And have not kept his statutes, And their idols have caused them to err, After which their fathers walked.
030	AMO	002	005	But I will send a fire upon Judah, Which shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem.
030	AMO	002	006	Thus saith Jehovah: For three transgressions of Israel, And for four, will I not turn away their punishment. For they sell the righteous for silver, And the needy for a pair of shoes;
030	AMO	002	007	They pant for the dust of the earth on the head of the poor, And pervert the cause of the afflicted. The son and the father go in to the same damsel, To dishonor my holy name.
030	AMO	002	008	They lay themselves down upon pledged garments Near every altar; And drink wine, procured by fines, In the house of their gods.
030	AMO	002	009	Yet I destroyed the Amorites before them, Who were tall as the cedars, And strong as the oaks. I destroyed their fruit above, And their roots beneath.
030	AMO	002	010	I brought you up from the land of Egypt, And led you in the desert forty years, That ye might possess the land of the Amorite.
030	AMO	002	011	Of your sons also I raised up prophets, And of your young men Nazarites; Is it not even so, O ye sons of Israel? saith Jehovah.
030	AMO	002	012	But ye gave the Nazarites wine to drink, And commanded the prophets, Saying, Prophesy not!
030	AMO	002	013	Behold, I will press you down, As a wagon presseth down that is full of sheaves.
030	AMO	002	014	And flight shall fail the swift, And the strong shall not exert his strength, And the mighty shall not save his life,
030	AMO	002	015	And he that handleth the bow shall not stand, And the swift of foot shall not save himself, And the horseman shall not escape with his life.
030	AMO	002	016	He that is strong in heart among the mighty Shall, in that day, flee away naked, saith Jehovah.
030	AMO	003	001	Hear these words, which Jehovah speaketh against you, ye sons of Israel; Against the whole family which I brought up out of the land of Egypt!
030	AMO	003	002	You only have I known of all the families of the earth; Therefore will I punish you for all your iniquities.
030	AMO	003	003	Can two walk together, Unless they agree together?
030	AMO	003	004	Will the lion roar in the forest, When he seeth no prey? Will the young lion cry aloud from his den, If he have seized nothing?
030	AMO	003	005	Can a bird fall into a snare upon the earth, Where none is set for him? Will a snare spring up from the ground, When it hath caught nothing?
030	AMO	003	006	Shall a trumpet be blown in the city, And the people not be afraid? Shall there be evil upon a city, And Jehovah not have done it?
030	AMO	003	007	Surely the Lord Jehovah doeth nothing, But he revealeth his secret To his servants the prophets.
030	AMO	003	008	When the lion roareth, who will not fear? When the Lord Jehovah speaketh, who will not prophesy?
030	AMO	003	009	Proclaim ye, in the palaces in Ashdod, And in the palaces in the land of Egypt, And say, Assemble yourselves upon the mountains of Samaria; Behold the great tumults in the midst of her, And the oppressions within her!
030	AMO	003	010	For they have no care to do right, saith Jehovah; They treasure up rapine and robbery in their palaces.
030	AMO	003	011	Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: An enemy shall encompass the land. And shall bring down thy strength from thee, And thy palaces shall be plundered.
030	AMO	003	012	Thus saith Jehovah: As the shepherd taketh out of the lion's mouth Two legs, or a portion of an ear, So shall the children of Israel be taken out, Who in Samaria sit in the corners of their sofas, And upon their damask couches.
030	AMO	003	013	Hear ye, and testify to the house of Jacob, Saith the Lord, Jehovah, God of hosts!
030	AMO	003	014	In the day when I punish the transgressions of Israel, Then will I punish the altars of Bethel; The horns of the altar shall be cut off, And fall to the ground.
030	AMO	003	015	and I will smite the winter-house together with the summer-house, And the houses of ivory shall be destroyed, And the great houses shall be brought to the ground, saith Jehovah.
030	AMO	004	001	Hear these words, O ye kine of Bashan, That are on the mountain of Samaria; That oppress the poor; that crush the needy; That say to your master, Bring, and let us drink!
030	AMO	004	002	The Lord Jehovah hath sworn by his holiness; Behold, the days shall come upon you When ye shall be taken away with hooks, And your residue with fishing-hooks.
030	AMO	004	003	And ye shall go out at the breaches, every one right forward, And ye shall be thrown into a castle, saith Jehovah.
030	AMO	004	004	Go, now, to Bethel, and transgress; At Gilgal multiply transgression! Bring your sacrifices every morning, And your tithes every three years!
030	AMO	004	005	Burn a thank-offering from your extortions, And proclaim the free-will offerings; publish them abroad! For this is your delight, ye sons of Israel, Saith the Lord, Jehovah.
030	AMO	004	006	I also have caused cleanness of teeth in all your cities, And want of bread in all your places; And yet ye have not returned to me, saith Jehovah.
030	AMO	004	007	I also have withholden from you the rain three months before the harvest; I have caused it to rain upon one city, And upon another city have I not caused it to rain; One piece of ground hath been rained upon, And another, upon which I have not caused it to rain, hath withered.
030	AMO	004	008	Two or three cities have gone to one city, To drink water, and have not been satisfied; And yet ye have not returned to me, saith Jehovah.
030	AMO	004	009	I have smitten you with blasting and mildew; The locust hath devoured your many gardens, Your vineyards, your fig-trees, and your olive-trees; Yet have ye not returned to me, saith Jehovah.
030	AMO	004	010	I have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of Egypt; I have slain your young men with the sword, And your horses have I led into captivity; I have made the smell of your camps to come up into your nostrils; And yet ye have not returned to me, saith Jehovah.
030	AMO	004	011	I have overthrown some of you, as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah; And ye were as a firebrand plucked out of the burning; And yet ye have not returned to me, saith Jehovah.
030	AMO	004	012	Therefore thus will I deal with thee, O Israel! Yet since I will thus deal with thee, Prepare to meet thy God, O Israel!
030	AMO	004	013	For behold, he formed the mountains, and created the wind; He declareth to man what is his thought; He maketh the morning darkness, And walketh upon the high places of the earth; Jehovah, God of hosts, is his name.
030	AMO	005	001	Hear these words, which I utter concerning you; This lamentation, O house of Israel!
030	AMO	005	002	She is fallen, she shall rise no more, The virgin of Israel! She is prostrate on her own ground, there is none to raise her up!
030	AMO	005	003	For thus saith the Lord Jehovah; The city which sent out a thousand shall have a hundred left, And that which sent out a hundred shall have ten left, To the house of Israel.
030	AMO	005	004	For thus saith Jehovah to the house of Israel: Seek ye me, and ye shall live!
030	AMO	005	005	Seek not Bethel, And go not to Gilgal, And pass not over to Beersheba! For Gilgal shall surely go into captivity! And Bethel shall come to naught.
030	AMO	005	006	Seek Jehovah, and ye shall live! Lest he rush like a fire on the house of Joseph, And it devour, and there be none to quench it in the house of Israel.
030	AMO	005	007	Ye who turn justice into wormwood, And cast righteousness down to the ground.
030	AMO	005	008	Seek him, that made the Pleiades and Orion; That changeth death-like darkness into morning, And darkeneth day into night; That calleth up the waters of the sea, And poureth them out upon the face of the earth; Jehovah is his name!
030	AMO	005	009	Who sendeth sudden destruction upon the strong, And bringeth desolation upon the fortress.
030	AMO	005	010	They hate him that pleadeth in the gate, And abhor him that speaketh uprightly.
030	AMO	005	011	Since, then, ye trample upon the poor, And take from him presents of wheat, Though ye build houses of hewn stone, ye shall not dwell in them; Though ye plant pleasant vineyards, ye shall not drink their wine.
030	AMO	005	012	For I know that your sins are many, And your transgressions manifold, Ye who afflict the righteous, and take a bribe, And oppress the poor in the gate!
030	AMO	005	013	Therefore the wise man shall be silent at that time, For it shall be an evil time.
030	AMO	005	014	Seek ye good, and not evil, that ye may live; Then shall Jehovah, the God of hosts, be with you, as ye boast.
030	AMO	005	015	Hate ye evil, and love good, And establish justice in the gate; It may be that Jehovah, the God of hosts, will have pity upon the remnant of Joseph.
030	AMO	005	016	Thus saith Jehovah, the God of hosts, the Lord: In all the streets shall there be wailing, And in all the highways shall they cry, Alas! alas! They shall call the husbandmen to mourning, And those who are skilful in lamentation to wailing,
030	AMO	005	017	And in all vineyards shall be sounds of woe, For I will pass through the midst of thee, saith Jehovah.
030	AMO	005	018	Woe unto them that ask for the day of Jehovah! What is the day of Jehovah to you? It shall be darkness, and not light.
030	AMO	005	019	As if a man fled from a lion, And a bear met him; Or went into a house and leaned his hand on a wall, And a serpent bit him;
030	AMO	005	020	So shall the day of Jehovah be darkness, and not light, Even thick darkness, and no brightness in it.
030	AMO	005	021	I hate, I despise your feasts; I have no delight in your solemn assemblies.
030	AMO	005	022	When ye offer me burnt-offerings and flour-offerings, I will not accept them; And upon the thank-offerings of your fatlings I will not look.
030	AMO	005	023	Take ye away from me the noise of your songs, And the music of your harps let me not hear!
030	AMO	005	024	Let justice flow forth as waters, And righteousness as a mighty stream!
030	AMO	005	025	Did ye offer me sacrifices and offerings In the wilderness, for forty years, O house of Israel?
030	AMO	005	026	But ye bore the tabernacle of your king, And the shrine of your images, The star of your god, which ye made for yourselves.
030	AMO	005	027	Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus, Saith Jehovah, whose name is the God of hosts!
030	AMO	006	001	Woe to them that dwell at ease in Zion; That feel secure upon the mountain of Samaria; The honorable men of the chief of the nations, To whom the house of Israel resort!
030	AMO	006	002	Pass over to Calneh, and see; And thence go to great Hamath; Then go down to Gath of the Philistines: Are they better than these kingdoms, Or is their border greater than your border?
030	AMO	006	003	Woe to them, that put far away the day of evil, And bring near the seat of oppression;
030	AMO	006	004	That lie upon beds of ivory, And stretch themselves upon their couches; That eat lambs from the flock, And calves from the stall;
030	AMO	006	005	That chant to the sound of the harp, And invent for themselves instruments of music, like David;
030	AMO	006	006	That drink wine in bowls, And anoint themselves with the most precious perfumes, But grieve not for the destruction of Joseph!
030	AMO	006	007	Therefore now shall they go captive at the head of the captives; Yea, the shouting of them that stretch themselves upon their couches shall cease.
030	AMO	006	008	The Lord Jehovah hath sworn by himself, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of hosts: I abhor the pride of Jacob, And I hate his palaces; I will give up the city, and all that is therein.
030	AMO	006	009	And if ten men remain in one house, These also shall die.
030	AMO	006	010	A man's relative, or a burner of the dead, shall take him up, To carry his bones out of the house, And he shall say to him that is in the innermost part of the house, Is there yet any one with thee? And he shall answer, No one! Then shall he say, Keep silence! For we may not make mention of the name of Jehovah.
030	AMO	006	011	For behold Jehovah hath commanded, And he will smite the great house with breaches, And the small house with clefts.
030	AMO	006	012	Shall horses run upon rocks, Or will one plough rocks with oxen, That ye change justice into hemlock, And the fruit of equity into wormwood,
030	AMO	006	013	Ye that rejoice in a thing of naught, And say, Have we not acquired dominion by our own strength?
030	AMO	006	014	Behold, O house of Israel, saith Jehovah, the God of hosts, I will raise against you a nation, That shall oppress you from Hamath Even to the brook of the desert.
030	AMO	007	001	The Lord Jehovah showed me this vision: Behold, he formed locusts In the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth; Behold, it was the latter growth after the king's mowing.
030	AMO	007	002	And when they had devoured the grass of the land, Then said I, O Lord Jehovah, forgive, I beseech thee! How shall Jacob stand? For he is small!
030	AMO	007	003	Jehovah repented of this; It shall not be, said Jehovah.
030	AMO	007	004	The Lord Jehovah also showed me this vision: Behold, the Lord Jehovah commanded the fire to execute judgment; And it devoured the great deep, And it devoured the fields.
030	AMO	007	005	Then said I, O Lord Jehovah, desist, I beseech thee! How shall Jacob stand? For he is small!
030	AMO	007	006	Jehovah repented of this; This also shall not be, said the Lord Jehovah.
030	AMO	007	007	He also showed me this vision: Behold, the Lord stood upon a wall, built with a plumb-line, And in his hand was a plumb-line;
030	AMO	007	008	And Jehovah said to me, What seest thou, Amos? And I said, A plumb-line. And the Lord said, Behold I will set a plumb-line in the midst of my people Israel; I will not spare them any more.
030	AMO	007	009	The high places of Isaac shall be desolate, And the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste, And I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.
030	AMO	007	010	Then sent Amaziah, the priest of Bethel, To Jeroboam, the king of Israel, and said: Amos conspireth against thee in the midst of the house of Israel; The land is not able to bear all his words.
030	AMO	007	011	For thus hath Amos said: Jeroboam shall die by the sword, And Israel shall surely be led captive from their own land.
030	AMO	007	012	And Amaziah said to Amos, Go, thou seer! flee into the land of Judah! There eat thy bread, and there prophesy!
030	AMO	007	013	But prophesy no more at Bethel, For it is the king's sanctuary, And it is the king's abode.
030	AMO	007	014	Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah: I was no prophet, nor the son of a prophet; I was a shepherd, and a gatherer of sycamore fruit.
030	AMO	007	015	And Jehovah took me from the flock; And Jehovah said to me, Go, prophesy to my people Israel!
030	AMO	007	016	Now, therefore, hear the word of Jehovah: Thou sayest, Prophesy not against Israel, And speak no word against the house of Isaac!
030	AMO	007	017	Therefore thus saith Jehovah: “Thy wife shall be put to shame in the city, And thy sons and daughters shall fall by the sword; Thy land shall be divided by the line, And thou shalt die in a polluted land, And Israel shall surely be led captive from his own land.”
030	AMO	008	001	The Lord Jehovah showed me this vision: Behold a basket of ripe fruits!
030	AMO	008	002	And he said, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A basket of ripe fruits. Then said Jehovah to me, The destruction of my people Israel is ripe; I will not spare them any more.
030	AMO	008	003	The songs of the palace shall be shrieks in that day, Saith the Lord Jehovah. There shall be many dead bodies in every place, And they shall be cast forth in silence.
030	AMO	008	004	Hear this, ye that pant to oppress the needy, And to destroy the poor of the land.
030	AMO	008	005	That say, When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell corn, And the Sabbath, that we may set forth wheat, Making the ephah small, and the shekel heavy, And falsifying the balances for deceit,
030	AMO	008	006	That we may buy the poor for silver, And the needy for a pair of shoes, And sell the refuse of the wheat?
030	AMO	008	007	Jehovah hath sworn by the glory of Jacob: Surely I will never forget any of their deeds.
030	AMO	008	008	Shall not the land tremble for this, And shall not all that dwell therein mourn? Shall not all of it rise in waves like a river, And be swept from its place, and overflowed, as by the river of Egypt!
030	AMO	008	009	It shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord Jehovah, That I will cause the sun to go down at noon, And will darken the land in the clear day.
030	AMO	008	010	I will turn your feasts into mourning, And all your songs into lamentation; I will bring sackcloth upon all loins, And baldness upon all heads. I will fill the land with mourning, as for an only son, And its end shall be as a day of bitter woe.
030	AMO	008	011	Behold, the time cometh, saith the Lord Jehovah, That I will send a famine upon the land; Not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, But of hearing the word of Jehovah.
030	AMO	008	012	And men shall wander from sea to sea, And from the north even to the east shall they run to and fro, To seek an answer from Jehovah, and shall not find it.
030	AMO	008	013	In that day shall the fair virgins, and the young men, faint for thirst,
030	AMO	008	014	Who swear by the sin of Samaria, And say, By the life of thy God, O Dan! And, By the worship of Beersheba! They shall fall, and shall rise no more!
030	AMO	009	001	I saw the Lord standing by the altar; and he said: Smite the capital, so that the thresholds shall tremble! Break them in pieces upon the heads of all of them! And their residue will I slay with the sword. He that fleeth of them shall not flee from danger, And he that escapeth of them shall not escape into safety.
030	AMO	009	002	Though they dig down to the under-world, Thence shall my hand take them; Though they climb up to heaven, Thence will I bring them down.
030	AMO	009	003	Though they hide themselves on the top of Carmel, There will I search for them, and take them away; Though they hide themselves from mine eyes in the bottom of the sea, There will I command the serpent, and he shall bite them.
030	AMO	009	004	Though they go into captivity before their enemies, There will I command the sword, and it shall slay them; I will set mine eyes upon them for evil, and not for good.
030	AMO	009	005	For the Lord Jehovah of hosts Is he, that toucheth the earth, and it shall melt, And all that dwell therein shall mourn; All of it shall rise in waves like a river, And shall be overflowed, as by the river of Egypt;
030	AMO	009	006	He that buildeth his upper rooms in the heavens, And foundeth his arch upon the earth, —That calleth the waters of the sea, And poureth them out upon the face of the earth, —Jehovah is his name.
030	AMO	009	007	Are ye not as the Ethiopians to me, O children of Israel? saith Jehovah. Did I not bring Israel from the land of Egypt, And the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?
030	AMO	009	008	Behold, the eyes of the Lord Jehovah are upon the sinful kingdom, And I will destroy it from the face of the earth; Yet will I not utterly destroy the house of Jacob, saith Jehovah.
030	AMO	009	009	For, behold, I will command, And I will sift the house of Israel among all the nations, As one sifteth corn with a sieve, And not a grain shall fall upon the ground.
030	AMO	009	010	But all the sinners of my people shall die by the sword, Who say, Evil shall not approach, nor fall upon us.
030	AMO	009	011	In that day I will raise up the fallen tabernacle of David, And I will close up the breaches thereof, And raise up its ruins, And I will build it, as in the days of old.
030	AMO	009	012	That they may possess the remnant of Edom, And all the nations, which shall be called by my name. Thus saith Jehovah, who doeth this.
030	AMO	009	013	Behold the days come, saith Jehovah, That the plougher shall draw near to the reaper, And the treader of grapes to the sower of the seed; And the mountains shall drop new wine, And all the hills shall melt.
030	AMO	009	014	I will bring back the captives of my people Israel, And they shall build the desolate cities, and shall inhabit them; And they shall plant vineyards, and drink their wine; They shall also make gardens, and eat their fruit.
030	AMO	009	015	I will plant them in their land, And they shall no more be rooted up from the land which I have given them, Saith Jehovah, thy God.

# BOOK	031	OBA	Obadiah	Obadiah
031	OBA	001	001	The prophecy of Obadiah. Thus saith the Lord Jehovah concerning Edom. We have heard a message from Jehovah, And an ambassador hath been sent among the nations “Arise ye, and let us rise up against her to war.”
031	OBA	001	002	Behold, I will make thee small among the nations; Thou shalt be greatly despised.
031	OBA	001	003	The pride of thine heart hath deceived thee, Thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, Whose habitation is high, Who sayest in thine heart, “Who shall bring me down to the ground?”
031	OBA	001	004	Though thou lift thyself up as the eagle, And though thou set thy nest among the stars, Thence will I bring thee down, saith Jehovah.
031	OBA	001	005	If thieves had come upon thee, Or robbers by night, Would they not have ceased stealing when they had enough? How art thou utterly destroyed! If grape-gatherers had come upon thee, Would they not have left gleanings of the grapes?
031	OBA	001	006	How is Esau searched through! How are his hidden places explored!
031	OBA	001	007	All thine allies have brought thee to the border; They that were at peace with thee have deceived thee, and prevailed against thee; They that ate thy bread have spread a snare under thee; There is no understanding in thee.
031	OBA	001	008	In that day, saith Jehovah, I will destroy the wise men from Edom, And understanding from the mount of Esau.
031	OBA	001	009	Thy mighty men, O Teman, shall be dismayed; Every one shall be cut off from the mount of Esau.
031	OBA	001	010	For slaughter and for oppression of thy brother Jacob shall shame cover thee, And thou shalt be destroyed forever.
031	OBA	001	011	In the day when thou stoodest over against him, In the day when strangers carried away captive his forces, And when foreigners entered his gates, And when they cast lots upon Jerusalem, Thou also wast as one of them.
031	OBA	001	012	But thou shouldst not have looked with delight on the day of thy brother in the day of his calamity; Nor shouldst thou have rejoiced over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction, Nor have spoken haughtily in the day of his distress.
031	OBA	001	013	Thou shouldst not have entered into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity, Nor have looked with delight on their affliction in the day of their calamity, Nor have laid hand on their substance in the day of their calamity,
031	OBA	001	014	Nor have stood in the cross-way to cut off their fugitives, Nor have delivered up those that remained in the day of distress!
031	OBA	001	015	For the day of Jehovah is near upon all the nations: As thou hast done, so shall it be done to thee; Thy dealing shall return upon thine own head.
031	OBA	001	016	For as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain, So shall all the nations drink perpetually, Yea, they shall drink and swallow it down, And they shall be as though they had not been.
031	OBA	001	017	But upon mount Zion shall be deliverance, and it shall be holy; And the house of Jacob shall regain their possessions.
031	OBA	001	018	And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, And the house of Joseph a flame, And the house of Esau stubble, And they shall kindle them and devour them. And there shall be none remaining of the house of Esau; For Jehovah hath spoken it.
031	OBA	001	019	And they of the south shall possess the mountain of Esau, And they of the plain, the Philistines; And they shall possess the fields of Ephraim, And the fields of Samaria; And Benjamin shall possess Gilead.
031	OBA	001	020	And the captives of this host of the sons of Israel shall possess the land of the Canaanites unto Sarepta, And the captives of Jerusalem which are at Sepharad shall possess the cities of the south.
031	OBA	001	021	And saviors shall go up to mount Zion, To rule the mount of Esau. And the kingdom shall be Jehovah's.

# BOOK	032	JON	Jonah	Jonah
032	JON	001	001	Now the word of Jehovah came to Jonah, the son of Amittai, saying,
032	JON	001	002	Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against it; for their wickedness is come up before me.
032	JON	001	003	But Jonah rose up to flee to Tarshish from the presence of Jehovah; and he went down to Joppa, and found a ship going to Tarshish, and paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with them to Tarshish from the presence of Jehovah.
032	JON	001	004	But Jehovah sent forth a great wind upon the sea, and there was a mighty tempest in the sea, so that the ship was like to be broken in pieces.
032	JON	001	005	Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man to his god. And they cast forth the things that were in the ship into the sea, to lighten it of them. But Jonah had gone down to the lower part of the ship, and he lay and was fast asleep.
032	JON	001	006	And the shipmaster came to him, and said to him, What meanest thou, O sleeper? Arise, call upon thy God! Perhaps God will think upon us, that we perish not.
032	JON	001	007	And they said one to another, come, and let us cast lots, that we may know on whose account this evil is upon us! And they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah.
032	JON	001	008	Then said they to him, Tell us, we pray thee, on whose account this evil is upon us. What is thy business? And whence comest thou? What is thy country? And of what people art thou?
032	JON	001	009	And he said to them, I am a Hebrew; and I fear Jehovah, the God of heaven, who made the sea and the dry land.
032	JON	001	010	Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said to him, Wherefore hast thou done this? For the men knew that he fled from the presence of Jehovah, because he had told them.
032	JON	001	011	Then said they to him, What shall we do to thee, that the sea may be calm to us? For the sea grew more and more tempestuous.
032	JON	001	012	And he said to them, Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; and the sea shall be calm to you. For I know that because of me this great tempest is upon you.
032	JON	001	013	Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring the ship to the land; but they could not; for the sea grew more and more tempestuous against them.
032	JON	001	014	And they cried to Jehovah, and said, We beseech thee, O Jehovah, we beseech thee, let us not perish for the life of this man, and lay not upon us innocent blood! For thou, O Jehovah, hast done as it pleased thee.
032	JON	001	015	And they took up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea; and the sea ceased from its raging.
032	JON	001	016	Then the men feared Jehovah exceedingly, and offered sacrifice to Jehovah, and made vows.
032	JON	001	017	Now Jehovah had appointed a great fish to swallow up Jonah. And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.
032	JON	002	001	Then Jonah prayed to Jehovah from the belly of the fish,
032	JON	002	002	and said: — I cried by reason of my distress to Jehovah, And he heard me: Out of the depth of the under-world I cried, And thou didst hear my voice.
032	JON	002	003	Thou didst cast me into the deep, into the heart of the sea, And the flood compassed me about; All thy billows and thy waves passed over me.
032	JON	002	004	And I said, “I am cast out from before thine eyes; Yet I will look again to thy holy temple!”
032	JON	002	005	The waters compassed me about, even to the life, The deep enclosed me round about; Sea-weeds were bound around my head;
032	JON	002	006	I sank down to the foundations of the mountains; The bars of the earth were about me forever; Yet hast thou brought up my life from the pit, O Jehovah, my God!
032	JON	002	007	When my soul fainted within me, I remembered Jehovah, And my prayer came to thee, To thy holy temple.
032	JON	002	008	They that honor lying vanities forsake their mercy;
032	JON	002	009	But I will sacrifice to thee with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay that which I have vowed; Salvation is from Jehovah.
032	JON	002	010	And Jehovah commanded the fish, and it cast out Jonah upon the dry land.
032	JON	003	001	And the word of Jehovah came to Jonah the second time, saying,
032	JON	003	002	Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and proclaim to her the words which I shall speak to thee.
032	JON	003	003	And Jonah arose and went to Nineveh, according to the word of Jehovah. Now Nineveh was through God a great city, three days' journey in extent.
032	JON	003	004	And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he cried out and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.
032	JON	003	005	And the men of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.
032	JON	003	006	For when the matter came to the king of Nineveh, he arose from his throne, and put off his mantle and covered himself with sackcloth, and sat in ashes.
032	JON	003	007	And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste anything; let them not feed, nor drink water.
032	JON	003	008	But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily to God. Yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that is in their hands.
032	JON	003	009	Who can tell if God will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not?
032	JON	003	010	And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way: and God repented of the evil which he had said that he would do to them, and he did it not.
032	JON	004	001	But this displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry.
032	JON	004	002	And he prayed to Jehovah and said, Ah! Jehovah, was not this what I said, when I was yet in my own country? Therefore I made haste to flee to Tarshish. For I knew that thou art a gracious and merciful God, slow to anger and abundant in mercy, and that thou repentest of a threatened evil.
032	JON	004	003	And now, O Jehovah, take, I pray thee, my life from me! for it is better for me to die than to live.
032	JON	004	004	And Jehovah said, Is it right that thou shouldst be angry?
032	JON	004	005	Now Jonah had gone out of the city, and had sat on the east side of the city, and had made himself a booth there, and had sat under it in the shade, till he should see what would become of the city.
032	JON	004	006	And God, Jehovah, appointed a gourd; and it grew up over Jonah to be a shadow over his head, to deliver him from his distress. And Jonah was exceedingly glad of the gourd.
032	JON	004	007	But God appointed a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the gourd so that it withered.
032	JON	004	008	And when the sun arose, God appointed a sultry east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, and he was faint, and he asked for himself death, and said, It is better for me to die than to live.
032	JON	004	009	And God said to Jonah, Is it right that thou shouldst be angry for the gourd? And he said, It is right that I should be angry even to death.
032	JON	004	010	And Jehovah said, Thou hast had pity on the gourd for which thou hast not labored, and which thou madest not to grow, which grew up in a night and perished in a night;
032	JON	004	011	and should not I spare Nineveh, the great city, wherein are more than a hundred and twenty thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand, and also many cattle?

# BOOK	033	MIC	Micah	Micah
033	MIC	001	001	The word of Jehovah, which came to Micah, the Morasthite, in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah; which was revealed to him concerning Judah and Jerusalem.
033	MIC	001	002	Hear, all ye nations, Give ear, O earth, and all that is therein! The Lord, Jehovah, appeareth as a witness against you, The Lord from his holy palace.
033	MIC	001	003	Behold, Jehovah cometh forth from his dwelling-place; He cometh down, and advanceth upon the high places of the earth.
033	MIC	001	004	The mountains melt under him, And the valleys cleave asunder, Like wax before the fire, Like waters poured down a steep place.
033	MIC	001	005	For the transgression of Jacob is all this, And for the sin of the house of Israel. Where is the transgression of Jacob? Is it not at Samaria? And where are the high places of Judah? Are they not at Jerusalem?
033	MIC	001	006	Therefore will I make Samaria a heap of stones in the field, A place for the planting of a vineyard; I will pour down her stones into the valley, And lay bare her foundations.
033	MIC	001	007	All her graven images shall be beaten to pieces, And all the hire of her harlotry shall be burned with fire, And all her idols will I destroy. For from the hire of a harlot did she gather her ornaments, And to the hire of a harlot shall they return.
033	MIC	001	008	Therefore I will wail and howl; I will go stripped and naked; I will wail like the jackal, And mourn like the ostrich.
033	MIC	001	009	For her wound is mortal; It extendeth to Judah; It reacheth to the gate of my people, even to Jerusalem.
033	MIC	001	010	Tell it not in Gath! weep not in Acco! In Beth-Aprah roll yourselves in the dust!
033	MIC	001	011	Pass on, thou inhabitant of Saphir, naked and in shame! The inhabitant of Zaanan no more goeth out; The grief of Beth-Azel denieth you an abode.
033	MIC	001	012	The inhabitant of Maroth mourneth for his goods, For evil came down from Jehovah to the gates of Jerusalem.
033	MIC	001	013	Bind the chariot to the courser, O inhabitant of Lachish! Thou wast the beginning of sin to the daughter of Zion; In thee were found the transgressions of Israel.
033	MIC	001	014	Therefore shalt thou resign the possession of Moresheth of Gath; The houses of Achzib shall disappoint the kings of Israel.
033	MIC	001	015	A possessor will I bring to thee, O inhabitant of Mareshah; The glory of Israel shall flee to Adullam.
033	MIC	001	016	Make thyself bald, cut off thy locks, for the children of thy love; Enlarge thy baldness like the eagle; For they have gone from thee into captivity.
033	MIC	002	001	Woe to them that devise iniquity, And contrive evil upon their beds; When the morning is light, they practise it, Because it is in the power of their hand.
033	MIC	002	002	They covet fields, and take them by violence; Houses, and take them from their owners. They defraud a man of his house; Yea, a man of his inheritance.
033	MIC	002	003	Therefore, thus saith Jehovah: Behold, against this race do I meditate evil. From which ye shall not remove your necks, nor lift up your heads; For it shall be a time of evil.
033	MIC	002	004	In that day shall this song be uttered concerning thee. And this sad lamentation be made: “We are utterly laid waste; He hath changed the portion of my people; How hath he torn it from me! He hath taken away and distributed our fields.”
033	MIC	002	005	Behold, thou shalt have no one henceforth Who shall draw out a line for a portion, In the congregation of Jehovah.
033	MIC	002	006	“Prophesy not,” [[say they, ]] “O ye that prophesy!” If they prophesy not concerning these things, The shame will not depart.
033	MIC	002	007	O ye that are called the house of Jacob, Is the spirit of Jehovah impatient? Are these his doings? Are not my words kind to him that walketh uprightly?
033	MIC	002	008	But long since hath my people risen against me, as an enemy; Ye strip the mantle from the garment of those that pass by securely, as men returning from war.
033	MIC	002	009	The women of my people ye cast out from their pleasant abodes; Ye deprive their children forever of the glory which I gave them.
033	MIC	002	010	Arise and depart; This land is not your rest! On account of its pollution shall it be wasted, And given to utter destruction.
033	MIC	002	011	If a man follow wind, and invent falsehood, and say, “I will prophesy to thee of wine and strong drink!” He will be the prophet for this people.
033	MIC	002	012	Yet will I fully gather thee, O Jacob, I will surely assemble the residue of Israel! I will put them together like sheep in a fold; Like a flock in their fold shall they be in a tumult on account of the multitude of men.
033	MIC	002	013	He that forceth a way goeth before them; They force their way, and pass through the gate, And go forth by it; And their king goeth before them, Even Jehovah at the head of them.
033	MIC	003	001	I also said: Hear, O ye heads of Jacob, And ye leaders of the house of Israel! Is it not for you to administer justice?
033	MIC	003	002	But ye hate what is good, and love what is evil; Ye tear from men their skin, Yea, their flesh from their bones;
033	MIC	003	003	Ye devour the flesh of my people, And strip them of their skin, And break their bones, And cut them in pieces, as for the pot, And as flesh for the caldron?
033	MIC	003	004	Then shall they cry to Jehovah, But he will not hear them; Yea, at that time will he hide his face from them, Because they have done iniquity.
033	MIC	003	005	Thus saith Jehovah concerning the prophets, who deceive my people, Who, while they bite with their teeth, proclaim peace, But who, if one fill not their mouths, prepare war against him:
033	MIC	003	006	Therefore shall night come upon you, so that ye shall have no vision, And darkness, so that ye shall not divine; The sun shall go down upon the prophets, And the day shall be dark to them.
033	MIC	003	007	Then shall the seers be ashamed, and the diviners confounded, So that all of them shall hide their faces, Because there is no answer from God.
033	MIC	003	008	But I am full of power, even of the spirit of Jehovah; Full of uprightness and courage, To declare to Jacob his transgression, And to Israel his sin.
033	MIC	003	009	O hear this, ye heads of the house of Jacob, And ye leaders of the house of Israel, Who abhor justice, And pervert all equity,
033	MIC	003	010	Who build up Zion with blood, And Jerusalem with iniquity!
033	MIC	003	011	Her heads judge for reward, And her priests teach for hire, And her prophets divine for money, And yet they lean upon Jehovah, saying, “Is not Jehovah in the midst of us? No evil can come upon us.”
033	MIC	003	012	Therefore because of you shall Zion be ploughed as a field, And Jerusalem become heaps of stones, And the mountain of the temple like the heights of a forest.
033	MIC	004	001	But it shall come to pass in the last days That the mountain of the house of Jehovah shall be established at the head of the mountains, And exalted above the hills; And the nations shall flow to it.
033	MIC	004	002	And many nations shall go, saying, “Come, let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah, To the house of the God of Jacob, That he may teach us his ways, And that we may walk in his paths!” For from Zion shall go forth a law, And the word of Jehovah from Jerusalem.
033	MIC	004	003	He shall be a judge of many nations, And an umpire of many kingdoms afar off. They shall beat their swords into ploughshares, And their spears into pruning-hooks; Nation shall not lift up the sword against nation, Neither shall they learn war any more.
033	MIC	004	004	But they shall sit every one under his vine, And under his fig-tree, And none shall make them afraid; The mouth of Jehovah of hosts hath spoken it.
033	MIC	004	005	Though all the nations walk every one in the name of its God, Yet will we walk in the name of Jehovah our God for ever and ever.
033	MIC	004	006	In that day, saith Jehovah, I will gather the halting, And the far scattered I will assemble, And those whom I have afflicted.
033	MIC	004	007	I will make the halting a remnant, And the far scattered a strong nation; And Jehovah shall reign over them in mount Zion, Henceforth, even forever.
033	MIC	004	008	And thou, O tower of the flock, O hill of the daughter of Zion, to thee it shall come, To thee shall come the former dominion, Even the kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem.
033	MIC	004	009	And now why dost thou cry aloud? Is there no king within thee? Have thy counsellors perished, That pangs have taken hold of thee, as of a woman in travail?
033	MIC	004	010	Yea, writhe, and be in anguish, O daughter of Zion, like a woman in travail! For now shalt thou go forth from the city, and dwell in the field; Thou shalt go even to Babylon; Yet there shalt thou be delivered. Jehovah will redeem thee from the hand of thine enemies.
033	MIC	004	011	Now many nations gather themselves against thee, Who say, Let her be polluted, And let our eyes gaze upon Zion!
033	MIC	004	012	But they know not the thoughts of Jehovah, And understand not his purposes; For he gathereth them as sheaves into the thrashing-floor.
033	MIC	004	013	Arise and thrash, O daughter of Zion! For I will make thy horns iron, And thy hoofs brass; Thou shalt beat in pieces many nations, And thou shalt devote their spoils to Jehovah, Their substance to the Lord of the whole earth.
033	MIC	005	001	Yet now gather yourselves in troops, O people of troops! They lay siege against us; With a rod they smite the cheek of the judge of Israel.
033	MIC	005	002	But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, Who art small to be among the thousands of Judah, Out of thee shall he come forth for me to be ruler in Israel, Whose origin is from the ancient age, from the days of old!
033	MIC	005	003	But He [[Jehovah]] shall deliver them up, Until she that bringeth forth hath brought forth; Then shall the residue of his brethren return to the children of Israel.
033	MIC	005	004	He shall stand and rule in the strength of Jehovah, In the majesty of Jehovah, his God; And they shall dwell in security, For he shall be great even to the ends of the earth.
033	MIC	005	005	And he shall be peace. When the Assyrian shall come into our land, To trample upon our palaces, Then shall we raise against him seven shepherds, And eight leaders of the people,
033	MIC	005	006	And they shall devour the land of Assyria with the sword, The land of Nimrod within her gates. Thus shall he deliver us from the Assyrian, when he cometh into our land, And treadeth in our borders.
033	MIC	005	007	The residue of Jacob shall be in the midst of many nations As the dew which cometh from Jehovah, As drops of rain upon the grass, Which tarrieth not for man, Nor waiteth for the sons of men.
033	MIC	005	008	The residue of Jacob shall be among the nations, In the midst of many kingdoms, As a lion among the beasts of the forest, As a young lion among flocks of sheep, Who, when he assaulteth, treadeth down and teareth, and none can deliver.
033	MIC	005	009	Thy hand shall be lifted up over thine adversaries, And all thine enemies shall be destroyed!
033	MIC	005	010	It shall come to pass in that day, saith Jehovah, That I will destroy thy horses from the midst of thee, And I will consume thy chariots;
033	MIC	005	011	I will destroy the fortified cities of thy land, And throw down all thy strongholds;
033	MIC	005	012	I will destroy sorceries from thy borders, And soothsayers shall not be with thee.
033	MIC	005	013	I will destroy thy graven images and thy statues from the midst of thee, And thou shalt no more bow down to the work of thine hands;
033	MIC	005	014	I will root out thy Astartes from the midst of thee, And I will destroy thy fortified cities;
033	MIC	005	015	And I will execute vengeance in anger and in fury Upon the nations which have not hearkened to me.
033	MIC	006	001	Hear ye what Jehovah saith! Arise, contend thou before the mountains, And let the hills hear thy voice!
033	MIC	006	002	Hear, O ye mountains, the controversy of Jehovah! Hear, ye strong foundations of the earth! For Jehovah hath a controversy with his people; He contendeth with Israel.
033	MIC	006	003	“O my people, what have I done to thee, And wherein have I offended thee? Testify against me!
033	MIC	006	004	I brought thee up from the land of Egypt, And from the house of bondage I redeemed thee; I sent Moses, Aaron, and Miriam, to go before thee.
033	MIC	006	005	O my people, remember what Balak the king of Moab devised. And what Balaam, the son of Beor, answered him, What happened from Shittim to Gilgal, That ye may know the mercies of Jehovah.”
033	MIC	006	006	Wherewith shall I come before Jehovah, And bow myself before the most high God? Shall I come before him with burnt-offerings, With calves of a year old?
033	MIC	006	007	Will Jehovah be pleased with thousands of rams, Or with ten thousands of rivers of oil? Shall I give my first-born for the sin of my soul, The fruit of my body for my transgression?
033	MIC	006	008	He hath showed thee, O man, what is good; What doth Jehovah require of thee, But to do justly, and to love mercy, And to walk humbly before thy God?
033	MIC	006	009	The voice of Jehovah crieth to the city, And the man of wisdom will discern thee; Hear ye the rod, and who hath threatened it!
033	MIC	006	010	Are there not yet in the houses of the unrighteous the treasures of iniquity, And the scanty measure, which is abominable?
033	MIC	006	011	Shall I count her pure with the wicked balances, And with the bag of deceitful weights?
033	MIC	006	012	For her rich men are full of violence, And her inhabitants speak lies, And their tongue is deceitful in their mouth.
033	MIC	006	013	Therefore will I sorely smite thee, And make thee desolate on account of thy sins.
033	MIC	006	014	Thou shalt eat and not be satisfied, And hunger shall be within thee. Thou shalt remove, but shalt not save, And what thou savest will I give up to the sword.
033	MIC	006	015	Thou shalt sow, but shalt not reap; Thou shalt tread the olives, but shalt not anoint thee with oil, And the grapes, but shalt not drink the wine.
033	MIC	006	016	For ye keep the statutes of Omri, And all the works of the house of Ahab, And walk in their devices; Therefore will I make thee a desolation, And thine inhabitants a derision; And ye shall bear the reproach of my people.
033	MIC	007	001	Woe is me! I live where the summer fruits are gathered, And the vintage is gleaned; There is no cluster to eat; I long for the first-ripe fig.
033	MIC	007	002	The good man is perished from the land, And there is none upright among men. They all lie in wait for blood; Every one hunteth his brother with a net.
033	MIC	007	003	Their hands are diligent for evil; The prince asketh a bribe, And the judge decideth for money! The great man giveth judgment according to his desire; They conspire to pervert justice.
033	MIC	007	004	The best of them is like a brier; The most upright of them is sharper than a thorn-hedge. The day of recompense, announced by thy watchmen, cometh; Then shall come their perplexity.
033	MIC	007	005	Trust ye not in a friend! Put no confidence in a guide! From her that lieth in thy bosom Keep the doors of thy mouth!
033	MIC	007	006	For the son dishonoreth his father, The daughter riseth up against her mother, And the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; The inmates of a man's house are his foes.
033	MIC	007	007	I will look to Jehovah; I will hope in the God of my salvation; My God will hear me.
033	MIC	007	008	Rejoice not over me, O my enemy! Though I have fallen, I shall arise; Though I sit in darkness, Jehovah will be my light.
033	MIC	007	009	I will bear the indignation of Jehovah, Because I have sinned against him, Until he maintain my cause, and execute judgment for me, Until he bring me to the light, And I behold his mercy.
033	MIC	007	010	She that is my enemy shall see it, and shame shall cover her, That said to me, Where is Jehovah thy God? Mine eyes shall gaze upon her; Soon shall she be trodden down, as the mire of the streets.
033	MIC	007	011	The day cometh when thy walls are to be built; In that day shall the decree be far removed.
033	MIC	007	012	In that day shall they come to thee From Assyria, and the cities of Egypt, And from Egypt to the river, From sea to sea, from mountain to mountain.
033	MIC	007	013	But first the land shall be desolate on account of its inhabitants, For the fruit of their doings.
033	MIC	007	014	Feed thy people with thy crook, The flock of thine inheritance, That dwell solitarily in the forest in the midst of Carmel! Let them feed in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.
033	MIC	007	015	As in the day when thou camest from Egypt, So will I show thee wonders.
033	MIC	007	016	The nations shall see, and be ashamed of all their might: They shall lay their hands upon their mouths; Their ears shall be deaf.
033	MIC	007	017	They shall lick the dust like the serpent; Like the creeping things of the earth, they shall come trembling from their strongholds; To Jehovah our God shall they come with awe, And shall fear on account of thee.
033	MIC	007	018	Who is a God like thee, that pardoneth iniquity and passeth by transgression, In the remnant of his inheritance? He retaineth not his anger forever, For he delighteth in mercy.
033	MIC	007	019	He will again have compassion on us, He will blot out our iniquities; Yea, thou wilt cast all our sins into the depths of the sea.
033	MIC	007	020	Thou wilt show faithfulness to Jacob, And mercy to Abraham, Which thou swarest to our fathers from the days of old.

# BOOK	034	NAH	Nahum	Nahum
034	NAH	001	001	The prophecy concerning Nineveh. The book of the prophecy of Nahum, the Elkoshite.
034	NAH	001	002	Jehovah is a jealous God, and an avenger; Jehovah is an avenger, and full of wrath! Jehovah taketh vengeance on his adversaries, And keepeth indignation for his enemies!
034	NAH	001	003	Jehovah is slow to anger, but great in power; He will by no means clear the guilty; Jehovah cometh in the whirlwind and the storm, And the clouds are the dust of his feet.
034	NAH	001	004	He rebuketh the sea, and maketh it dry, And drieth up all the rivers. Bashan languisheth, and Carmel, And the flower of Lebanon languisheth.
034	NAH	001	005	The mountains tremble before him, And the hills melt; The earth is moved at his presence, Yea, the world and all that dwell therein.
034	NAH	001	006	Who can stand before his indignation, And who can abide before the fierceness of his anger? His fury is poured out like fire, And the rocks are cast down by him!
034	NAH	001	007	Jehovah is good, A stronghold in the day of trouble; He careth for them that trust in him;
034	NAH	001	008	But with an overwhelming flood will he make a full end of her place, And darkness shall pursue his enemies.
034	NAH	001	009	What do ye meditate against Jehovah? He will make a full end; Not the second time shall the calamity come.
034	NAH	001	010	For while they are entangled like thorns, And like those that are drunk with wine, They shall be devoured as stubble fully dry.
034	NAH	001	011	From thee hath gone forth one that devised evil against Jehovah; That meditated destruction.
034	NAH	001	012	Thus saith Jehovah: Though they be flourishing, and likewise many, Yet shall they be cut down, and pass away; I have afflicted thee, but I will afflict thee no more.
034	NAH	001	013	For now will I break his yoke from off thee, And will burst thy bonds in sunder.
034	NAH	001	014	And concerning thee hath Jehovah given command, That thy name shall no more be sown. From the house of thy god I will cut off the graven image and the molten image; I will make thy grave; for thou hast become vile!
034	NAH	001	015	Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, That publisheth peace! Keep, O Judah, thy feasts, perform thy vows! For no more shall the destroyer pass through thee; He is utterly consumed.
034	NAH	002	001	The ravager cometh up against thee, [[O Nineveh!]] Guard the fortress; watch the way; Gird up the loins; confirm the strength.
034	NAH	002	002	For Jehovah restoreth the glory of Jacob, As the glory of Israel; For the wasters have wasted them, And destroyed their branches.
034	NAH	002	003	The shields of his mighty men are red; His warriors are clothed in crimson; His chariots glitter with the fire of steel in the day of his preparation, And the spears are brandished.
034	NAH	002	004	The chariots rave in the streets; They run to and fro in the broad ways; Their appearance is like torches; They run like lightnings.
034	NAH	002	005	He calleth for his mighty men; They stumble on their way; They hasten to the wall; But the mantelet is prepared,
034	NAH	002	006	The gates of rivers are opened, And the palace melteth away.
034	NAH	002	007	Huzzab is uncovered; she is carried away captive, Her maidservants sigh with the voice of doves, And smite their breasts.
034	NAH	002	008	Nineveh was like a pool full of water of old; Yet shall they flee away; Stand! stand! shall they cry; But none shall look back.
034	NAH	002	009	Seize the silver; seize the gold; There is no end to the treasures; There is abundance of all precious furniture.
034	NAH	002	010	She hath become void, and empty, and desolate; The heart melteth, and the knees smite together; Pangs are in all their loins, And the faces of all gather blackness.
034	NAH	002	011	Where now is the dwelling of the lions, And the feeding-place of the young lions, Where the lion and the lioness walked, And the lion's whelp, and none made them afraid?
034	NAH	002	012	The lion tore in pieces for his whelps, And strangled for his lionesses, And filled his dens with prey, And his lairs with ravin.
034	NAH	002	013	Behold! I am against thee, saith Jehovah of hosts, And I will burn thy chariots into smoke, And the sword shall devour thy young lions. And I will cut off thy prey from the earth, And the voice of thy messengers shall no more be heard.
034	NAH	003	001	Woe to the city of blood! She is all full of deceit and robbery; She ceaseth not from plunder.
034	NAH	003	002	[[Hark!]] The noise of the whip! The noise of the rattling of the wheels, And of the prancing horses, And of the bounding chariots!
034	NAH	003	003	The horseman lifteth up the flame of the sword, And the lightning of the spear; There is a multitude of the slain; heaps of dead bodies; There is no end to the carcasses; they stumble over the carcasses.
034	NAH	003	004	It is because of the many whoredoms of the harlot, The graceful beauty, the mistress of enchantments, That sold nations by her whoredoms, And kingdoms by her enchantments.
034	NAH	003	005	Behold, I am against thee, saith Jehovah of host, And I will lift up thy trail over thy face, And I will show the nations thy nakedness, And the kingdoms thy shame.
034	NAH	003	006	And I will cast abominable filth upon thee, And I will dishonor thee, and make thee a gazing-stock,
034	NAH	003	007	And all that see thee shall flee from thee, And shall say, “Nineveh is laid waste; Who will bemoan her? Whence shall I seek comforters for thee?”
034	NAH	003	008	Art thou better than No-Ammon, That dwelt by the rivers, That had the waters round about her, Whose fortress was the sea, And whose wall was from the waters?
034	NAH	003	009	Ethiopia and Egypt were her strength, a countless multitude; Phut and Lybia were thy helpers!
034	NAH	003	010	Yet was she carried away; she went into captivity; Her children were dashed in pieces at the head of all the streets; For her honorable men they cast lots, And all her great men were bound in chains.
034	NAH	003	011	Thou also shalt drink to the full; Thou, too, shalt be hidden; Thou shalt seek a refuge from the enemy!
034	NAH	003	012	All thy strong-holds shall be like fig-trees with the first ripe figs; If they be shaken, they fall into the mouth of the eater.
034	NAH	003	013	Behold, thy people shall be women in the midst of thee; The gates of thy land shall be set wide open to thine enemies; The fire shall devour thy bars.
034	NAH	003	014	Draw thee water for the siege, Fortify thy strongholds. Go into the clay, and tread the mortar; Repair the brick-kiln!
034	NAH	003	015	Then shall the fire devour thee; The sword shall cut thee off, It shall devour thee like the locust; Though thou art increased like the locusts, Though thou art increased like the thick locusts.
034	NAH	003	016	Thy merchants have been more numerous than the stars of heaven; The locusts spread themselves and fly away.
034	NAH	003	017	Thy princes are like locusts, And thy captains like swarms of locusts, Which encamp in the hedges in the time of cold; But when the sun ariseth, they flee away, And the place is not known where they are.
034	NAH	003	018	Thy shepherds slumber, O king of Assyria! Thy nobles take their rest, Thy people are scattered on the mountains, and none gathereth them.
034	NAH	003	019	Thy bruise is incurable; Thy wound is mortal. All that hear of thee shall clap their hands over thee; For upon whom hath not thy wickedness passed continually?

# BOOK	035	HAB	Habakkuk	Habakkuk
035	HAB	001	001	The prophecy which was revealed to the prophet Habakkuk.
035	HAB	001	002	How long, O Jehovah, do I cry, and thou dost not hear! How long do I complain to thee of violence, and thou dost not save!
035	HAB	001	003	Why dost thou suffer me to see iniquity, And why dost thou look upon wickedness? For spoiling and violence are before me; There is contention, and strife exalteth itself.
035	HAB	001	004	Therefore the law faileth, And judgment is not pronounced according to truth; For the wicked encompasseth the righteous, Therefore wrong judgment is pronounced.
035	HAB	001	005	Behold ye among the nations, and look! Yea, wonder, and be astonished! For I do a work in your days Which ye will not believe though it be told you.
035	HAB	001	006	For behold, I raise up the Chaldeans, A fierce and swift people, Which go over the breadth of the earth, To take possession of dwelling-places that are not their own.
035	HAB	001	007	They are terrible and dreadful; From themselves go forth their law and their dignity.
035	HAB	001	008	Their horses are swifter than leopards, And fiercer than evening wolves. Their horsemen leap proudly; Their horsemen come from far; They fly like an eagle, hastening to devour.
035	HAB	001	009	All of them come for violence; The multitude of their faces is directed forwards, And they gather captives as sand.
035	HAB	001	010	They also scoff at kings, And princes are to them a laughing-stock; They deride every stronghold, For they heap up earth and take it.
035	HAB	001	011	Then their spirit is uplifted, and they transgress, and become guilty; This their strength is made their god.
035	HAB	001	012	Art thou not from everlasting, O Jehovah, my God, my Holy One? We shall not die! Thou, O Jehovah, hast appointed them for judgment; Thou, O Rock, hast ordained them for chastisement.
035	HAB	001	013	Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, And canst not look on wickedness; Why then dost thou look on transgressors, And art silent, when the wicked swalloweth up the man that is more righteous than he?
035	HAB	001	014	And why makest thou men as the fishes of the sea, As the reptiles that have no ruler?
035	HAB	001	015	They take up all of them with the hook, They catch them in their net, And gather them in their drag; Therefore they rejoice and exult.
035	HAB	001	016	Therefore they sacrifice to their net, And burn incense to their drag; Because by them their portion is fat, And their food plenteous.
035	HAB	001	017	Shall they therefore empty the net, And slay the nations continually without mercy?
035	HAB	002	001	I will stand on my watch-tower, And set myself on the bulwark, And watch to see what he will say to me, And what I shall answer to my expostulation.
035	HAB	002	002	And Jehovah answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make it plain upon tablets, That he may run that readeth it.
035	HAB	002	003	For the vision is yet for an appointed time, But it hasteneth to the end; it shall not deceive; If it tarry, wait for it; For it shall surely come; it shall not long delay.
035	HAB	002	004	Behold, the soul of him that is puffed up shall not be at ease; But the just shall live by his faithfulness.
035	HAB	002	005	Behold, the man of wine is outrageous; The proud man remaineth not at rest; He enlargeth his desire as the grave; He is as death, and cannot be satisfied; He gathereth to himself all the nations, And collecteth to himself all the kingdoms.
035	HAB	002	006	Shall not all of them utter a song against him, Yea, songs of reproach and derision concerning him? And say, Woe to him that heapeth up that which belongeth not to him! For how long a time? That ladeth himself with goods taken in pledge!
035	HAB	002	007	Shall not they suddenly rise up that will oppress thee, And awake, that will harass thee? Yea, thou shalt be their booty.
035	HAB	002	008	Because thou hast plundered many kingdoms, All the residue of the nations shall plunder thee: For the blood of men, and for violence against the land, Against the city and all its inhabitants.
035	HAB	002	009	Woe to him that procureth unjust gain for his house, That he may set his nest on high, That he may be delivered from the evil hand!
035	HAB	002	010	Thou hast devised shame for thine house; By destroying many nations, thou hast brought ruin upon thyself.
035	HAB	002	011	For the stone from the wall crieth out, And the beam from the timber answereth it.
035	HAB	002	012	Woe to him that buildeth a town by blood, And establisheth a city by iniquity!
035	HAB	002	013	Behold, it is determined by Jehovah of hosts, That nations shall labor for the fire, And kingdoms weary themselves for naught.
035	HAB	002	014	For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of Jehovah, As the waters cover the sea.
035	HAB	002	015	Woe to him who giveth his neighbor drink; Who poureth out the strong wine, and maketh him drunken, That he may look upon his nakedness!
035	HAB	002	016	Thou shalt be filled with shame instead of glory; Drink thou also, and show thy foreskin! To thee shall come the cup in the right hand of Jehovah, And foul shame shall be upon thy glory.
035	HAB	002	017	For the violence done to Lebanon shall cover thee, And the destruction of the beasts which made them afraid, On account of the blood of men, and violence against the land, Against the city and all its inhabitants.
035	HAB	002	018	What profiteth the graven image, When the maker hath graven it? Or the molten image, and the teacher of lies, That the artificer trusteth in his work, When he maketh dumb idols?
035	HAB	002	019	Woe to him who saith to the wood, Awake! To the dumb stone, Arise! Will it teach? Behold, it is overlaid with gold and silver, And there is no breath within it.
035	HAB	002	020	But Jehovah is in his Holy temple; Be silent before him, all the earth!
035	HAB	003	001	The prayer of Habakkuk the prophet, in the form of an ode.
035	HAB	003	002	O Jehovah, I have heard thy words, and tremble. O Jehovah, revive thy work in the midst of the years, In the midst of the years make it known, In wrath remember mercy!
035	HAB	003	003	God cometh from Teman, And the Holy One from mount Paran; His glory covereth the heavens, And the earth is full of his praise.
035	HAB	003	004	His brightness is as the light; Rays stream forth from his hand, And there is the hiding-place of his power.
035	HAB	003	005	Before him goeth the pestilence, And the plague followeth his steps.
035	HAB	003	006	He standeth, and measureth the earth; He beholdeth, and maketh the nations tremble; The everlasting mountains are broken asunder; The eternal hills sink down; The eternal paths are trodden by him.
035	HAB	003	007	I see the tents of Cushan in affliction, And the canopies of the land of Midian tremble.
035	HAB	003	008	Is the anger of Jehovah kindled against the rivers, Is thy wrath against the rivers, Is thy indignation against the floods, That thou ridest on with thy horses, Upon thy chariots of victory?
035	HAB	003	009	Thy bow is made bare; Curses are the arrows of thy word; Thou causest rivers to break forth from the earth.
035	HAB	003	010	The mountains see thee and tremble; The flood of waters overflows; The deep uttereth his voice, And lifteth up his hands on high.
035	HAB	003	011	The sun and the moon remain in their habitation, At the light of thine arrows which fly, At the brightness of the lightning of thy spear.
035	HAB	003	012	Thou marchest through the land in indignation; Thou thrashest the nations in anger;
035	HAB	003	013	Thou goest forth for the deliverance of thy people, For the deliverance of thine anointed. Thou smitest the head of the house of the wicked; Thou destroyest the foundation even to the neck.
035	HAB	003	014	Thou piercest with his own spears the chief of his captains, Who rushed like a whirlwind to scatter us; Who exulted, as if they should devour the distressed in a hiding-place.
035	HAB	003	015	Thou ridest through the sea with thy horses, Through the raging of mighty waters.
035	HAB	003	016	I have heard, and my heart trembleth; My lips quiver at the voice; Rottenness entereth into my bones, and my knees tremble, That I must wait in silence for the day of trouble, When the invader shall come up against my people!
035	HAB	003	017	For the fig-tree shall not blossom, And there shall be no fruit upon the vine; The produce of the olive shall fail, And the fields shall yield no food. The flocks shall he cut off from the folds, And there shall be no herd in the stalls.
035	HAB	003	018	Yet will I rejoice in Jehovah, I will exult in God, my helper.
035	HAB	003	019	The Lord Jehovah is my strength; He will make my feet like the hind's, And cause me to walk upon my high places. “To the leader of the music on my stringed instruments.”

# BOOK	036	ZEP	Zephaniah	Zephaniah
036	ZEP	001	001	The word of Jehovah, which came to Zephaniah, the son of Cushi, the son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of Hizkiah, in the days of Josiah, the son of Amon, king of Judah.
036	ZEP	001	002	I will utterly consume all things from the face of the land, saith Jehovah;
036	ZEP	001	003	I will consume man and beast; I will consume the birds of heaven, and the fishes of the sea, And the stumbling-blocks with the wicked; And I will cut off man from the face of the land, saith Jehovah.
036	ZEP	001	004	I will stretch out my hand over Judah, And over all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, And I will cut off from this place the residue of Baal, The name of the idol-sacrificers with the priests,
036	ZEP	001	005	And those who bow themselves on the house-tops to the host of heaven, And those who bow themselves and swear by Jehovah, And also swear by their idol,
036	ZEP	001	006	And those that turn back from Jehovah, And those that seek not Jehovah, nor inquire for him.
036	ZEP	001	007	Be silent before the Lord Jehovah! For the day of Jehovah is near; For Jehovah hath prepared a sacrifice; He hath appointed his guests.
036	ZEP	001	008	And in the day of the sacrifice of Jehovah it shall come to pass That I will punish the princes and the sons of the king, And all that are clothed with foreign apparel.
036	ZEP	001	009	In that day also will I punish all that leap over the threshold, That fill the houses of their master with violence and deceit.
036	ZEP	001	010	And it shall come to pass in that day, saith Jehovah, That there shall be the noise of a cry from the fish-gate, And of a howling from the other part of the city, And of great destruction from the hills.
036	ZEP	001	011	Howl, ye inhabitants of Maktesh! For all the trafficking people are cut down; All they that bear silver are destroyed.
036	ZEP	001	012	And it shall come to pass at that time, That I will search Jerusalem with lamps, And I will punish the men that are settled on their lees; That say in their hearts, “Jehovah doeth neither good nor evil.”
036	ZEP	001	013	Their substance shall become a spoil, And their houses a desolation; They shall also build houses, but not inhabit them; And shall plant vineyards, but not drink the wine thereof.
036	ZEP	001	014	The day of Jehovah is near, the great day; It is near, and hasteth greatly; The day of Jehovah shall resound; Bitterly shall the mighty man cry for help.
036	ZEP	001	015	That day is a day of wrath, A day of distress and anguish, A day of destruction and desolation, A day of darkness and gloominess, A day of clouds and thick darkness,
036	ZEP	001	016	A day of the trumpet and the war-shout, Against the fenced cities, And against the high towers.
036	ZEP	001	017	And I will distress the men, so that they shall walk like the blind, Because they have sinned against Jehovah. And their blood shall be poured out as dust, And their flesh as dung.
036	ZEP	001	018	Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of Jehovah, But by the fire of his indignation shall the whole land be devoured; For destruction, and that a speedy one, will he bring Upon all that dwell in the land.
036	ZEP	002	001	Search yourselves; yea, search, O nation without shame!
036	ZEP	002	002	Before the decree bring forth, Before the day come upon you like chaff; Before the fierce anger of Jehovah come upon you, Before the day of the anger of Jehovah come upon you.
036	ZEP	002	003	Seek ye Jehovah, all ye lowly of the land, Ye, who obey his commands! Seek righteousness; seek lowliness; It may be that ye shall be hid in the day of the anger of Jehovah.
036	ZEP	002	004	For Gaza shall be forsaken, And Askelon a desolation; Ashdod shall be driven out at noonday, And Ekron shall be rooted up.
036	ZEP	002	005	Woe to the inhabitants of the sea-coasts, the nation of the Cherethites! This is the word of Jehovah against you, O Canaan, land of the Philistines: “I will destroy thee, that there shall be no inhabitant.”
036	ZEP	002	006	And the sea-coast shall be pastures full of habitations for shepherds, and folds for flocks.
036	ZEP	002	007	The coast shall be for the residue of the house of Judah; Thereon shall they feed; In the houses of Askelon shall they lie down in the evening; For Jehovah their God will look upon them, and bring back their captives.
036	ZEP	002	008	I have heard the reproach of Moab, And the revilings of the sons of Ammon, With which they have reproached my people, And exalted themselves against their borders.
036	ZEP	002	009	Therefore, as I live, saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, Moab shall be as Sodom, And the sons of Ammon as Gomorrah, A possession for thorns, and a pit for salt, and a perpetual desolation. The residue of my people shall spoil them, And the remainder of my nation shall possess them.
036	ZEP	002	010	This shall come upon them for their pride, Because they have uttered reproaches, and exalted themselves against the people of Jehovah of hosts.
036	ZEP	002	011	Jehovah will be terrible against them; For he will destroy all the gods of the earth; And before him shall worship, every one from his place, All the islands of the nations.
036	ZEP	002	012	Ye, also, O Ethiopians! Ye shall be slain by my sword!
036	ZEP	002	013	He will also stretch out his hand against the North, And destroy Assyria, And make Nineveh a desolation, Even dry like a desert.
036	ZEP	002	014	And flocks shall lie down in the midst of her, Yea, all the tribes of wild beasts; The pelican and the hedgehog shall lodge in the capitals of her pillars; A cry shall resound in the window; Desolation shall be upon the threshold; For her cedar-work shall be laid bare.
036	ZEP	002	015	This is the rejoicing city that dwelt in security, That said in her heart, “I, and none besides me!” Now is she become a desolation, a resting-place for wild beasts! Every one that passeth by her shall hiss, and wag his hand.
036	ZEP	003	001	Woe to her that is rebellious and polluted, The oppressing city!
036	ZEP	003	002	She listeneth to no voice, She receiveth not admonition; She trusteth not in Jehovah, She draweth not near to her God.
036	ZEP	003	003	Her princes within her are roaring lions; Her judges are evening wolves; They reserve nothing for the morning.
036	ZEP	003	004	Her prophets are vainglorious, Men of treachery; Her priests pollute the sanctuary, They violate the law.
036	ZEP	003	005	But Jehovah is just in the midst of her; He doeth no iniquity. Every morning bringeth he his righteousness to light; he faileth not; Yet the wicked knoweth not shame.
036	ZEP	003	006	I have cut off nations; their towers are destroyed; I have laid waste their streets so that none passeth through; Their cities are made desolate, without a man, without an inhabitant.
036	ZEP	003	007	Then I said, “Surely thou wilt fear me; thou wilt receive admonition, That thy habitation may not be cut off, As I have commanded concerning thee.” But they were diligent to commit iniquity In all their doings.
036	ZEP	003	008	Therefore wait for me, saith Jehovah. Until the day when I rise up to the prey. For my purpose is to gather the nations, to assemble the kingdoms, To pour upon them my indignation, Even all the heat of my wrath. For with the fire of mine anger shall all the earth be devoured.
036	ZEP	003	009	Then will I again bestow upon the nations pure lips, So that they shall all of them call upon the name of Jehovah, And serve him with one consent.
036	ZEP	003	010	From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia My suppliants, the sons of my dispersed ones, shall bring my offering.
036	ZEP	003	011	In that day thou shalt not be ashamed For all thy doings, wherein thou hast transgressed against me; For I will take away from the midst of thee thy proud exulters, And thou shalt no more exalt thyself upon my holy mountain.
036	ZEP	003	012	I will leave in the midst of thee a humble and lowly people, Who trust in the name of Jehovah.
036	ZEP	003	013	The residue of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor speak falsehood; Neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth; Therefore shall they feed and lie down, and none shall make them afraid.
036	ZEP	003	014	Sing, O daughter of Zion! Shout, O Israel! Rejoice and exult with all thy heart, O daughter of Jerusalem!
036	ZEP	003	015	Jehovah hath taken away thy punishments; He hath removed thine enemies. The king of Israel, Jehovah, is in the midst of thee; Thou shalt see evil no more.
036	ZEP	003	016	In that day shall it be said to Jerusalem, Fear not! And to Zion, Let not thy hands hang down!
036	ZEP	003	017	Jehovah thy God will be in the midst of thee; The mighty one will save thee. He will rejoice over thee with gladness; He will pardon thee in his love; He will exult over thee with singing.
036	ZEP	003	018	I will gather them that mourn, far from the solemn assembly, They were far from thee; the reproach was a burden upon thee.
036	ZEP	003	019	Behold, at that time I will destroy all that afflict thee; And I will save the halting, and gather the scattered, And I will make them a praise and a name In every land where they have been put to shame.
036	ZEP	003	020	At that time I will bring you back, And at that time I will gather you; For I will make you a name and a praise among all the nations of the earth, When I bring back your captives before your eyes, saith Jehovah.

# BOOK	037	HAG	Haggai	Haggai
037	HAG	001	001	In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, on the first day of the month, came the word of Jehovah by Haggai the prophet to Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua, the son of Josedech, the high-priest, saying,
037	HAG	001	002	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: This people saith, The time is not yet come, the time that the house of Jehovah should be built.
037	HAG	001	003	But the word of Jehovah hath come by Haggai the prophet, saying: —
037	HAG	001	004	Is it, then, a time for yourselves To dwell in ceiled houses, While this house lieth waste?
037	HAG	001	005	Therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Consider how it goeth with you!
037	HAG	001	006	Ye sow much, and bring in little; Ye eat, but are not full; Ye drink, but are not satisfied; Ye clothe yourselves, but are not warmed; And he that earneth wages earneth them for a purse with holes.
037	HAG	001	007	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Consider how it goeth with you!
037	HAG	001	008	Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house, That I may have pleasure therein, And be glorified, saith Jehovah.
037	HAG	001	009	Ye look for much, and lo, it cometh to little; And when ye bring it home, I blow it away; And why? saith Jehovah of hosts. Because of my house which lieth waste, While ye run every one to his own house.
037	HAG	001	010	Therefore the heaven over you withholdeth the dew, And the earth refuseth her fruit.
037	HAG	001	011	And I have called for a drought upon the land, and upon the mountains; And upon the corn, and the new wine, and the oil; Upon that which the ground bringeth forth, And upon men, and upon cattle, And upon all the labor of the hands.
037	HAG	001	012	Then Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua, the son of Josedech, the high-priest, and all the remnant of people, hearkened to the voice of Jehovah their God, and to the words of Haggai the prophet, as Jehovah their God had sent him; and the people feared before Jehovah.
037	HAG	001	013	Then spake Haggai, the messenger of Jehovah, by a message from Jehovah to the people, saying, I am with you, saith Jehovah.
037	HAG	001	014	And Jehovah stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua, the son of Josedech, the high-priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of people, so that they came and executed work upon the house of Jehovah of hosts, their God,
037	HAG	001	015	on the four and twentieth day of the sixth month, in the second year of Darius the king.
037	HAG	002	001	In the seventh month, on the one and twentieth day of the month, came the word of Jehovah by the prophet Haggai, saying:
037	HAG	002	002	Speak now to Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua, the son of Josedech, the high-priest, and to the remnant of the people, saying: —
037	HAG	002	003	Who is there left among you, That saw this house In its former glory? And what do ye see it now? Is it not as nothing in your eyes?
037	HAG	002	004	Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, saith Jehovah; And be strong, O Joshua, son of Josedech, the high-priest; And be strong, O all ye people of the land, saith Jehovah, and work! For I am with you, saith Jehovah of hosts.
037	HAG	002	005	This is the covenant which I made with you when ye came out of Egypt, And my spirit remaineth among you: Fear ye not!
037	HAG	002	006	For thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Yet once more, in a short time, I will shake the heavens and the earth, The sea and the dry land.
037	HAG	002	007	I will shake all the nations, And here shall come the precious things of all the nations; And I will fill this house with glory, Saith Jehovah of hosts.
037	HAG	002	008	Mine is the silver and mine the gold, Saith Jehovah of hosts;
037	HAG	002	009	Greater shall be the glory of this latter house than of the former, Saith Jehovah of hosts; And in this place will I give peace, Saith Jehovah of hosts.
037	HAG	002	010	On the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of Jehovah by Haggai the prophet, saying,
037	HAG	002	011	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Ask now the law from the priests, saying,
037	HAG	002	012	If a man carry holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any food, shall it be holy? And the priests answered and said, No.
037	HAG	002	013	Then said Haggai, If a man unclean by a dead body touch any of these things, shall it be unclean? And the priests answered and said, It shall be unclean.
037	HAG	002	014	Then answered Haggai and said: — So is this people, and so is this nation before me, saith Jehovah; And so is all the work of their hands; And that which they offer there is unclean.
037	HAG	002	015	And now, I pray you, consider [[how it hath gone with you]] From that day and upward, From the time before one stone was laid upon another in the temple of Jehovah.
037	HAG	002	016	Since that time one hath come to a heap of twenty measures, And there were but ten; One hath come to a vat to draw out fifty vessels from the wine-press, And there were but twenty;
037	HAG	002	017	I have smitten you with blasting, with mildew, and with hail, Even all the works of your hands; Yet none among you hath turned to me, saith Jehovah.
037	HAG	002	018	Consider, I pray you, From that day and upward, From the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, From the day when the foundation of the temple of Jehovah was laid, Consider ye!
037	HAG	002	019	Is there yet seed in the barn? Yea, as yet the vine, and the fig-tree, and pomegranate, and the olive-tree have not borne. But from this day will I bless you.
037	HAG	002	020	And the word of Jehovah came the second time to Haggai, on the four and twentieth day of the month, saying,
037	HAG	002	021	Speak to Zerubbabel, the governor of Judah, and say: — I will shake the heavens and the earth,
037	HAG	002	022	And I will overthrow the thrones of kingdoms, And I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations, And I will overthrow the chariots, and those that ride in them, And the horses and their riders shall come down, One by the sword of the other.
037	HAG	002	023	In that day, saith Jehovah of hosts, I will take thee, O Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel, my servant, saith Jehovah, And keep thee as a signet-ring; For thee have I chosen, saith Jehovah of hosts.

# BOOK	038	ZEC	Zechariah	Zechariah
038	ZEC	001	001	In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of Jehovah to Zechariah, the son of Barachiah, the son of Iddo, the prophet, saying: —
038	ZEC	001	002	Jehovah hath been much displeased with your fathers.
038	ZEC	001	003	But say thou to them, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Turn ye to me, saith Jehovah of hosts, And I will turn to you, saith Jehovah of hosts.
038	ZEC	001	004	Be ye not as your fathers, to whom the former prophets cried, saying, Turn ye now from your evil ways, and from your evil doings! But they did not hear, nor hearken to me, saith Jehovah.
038	ZEC	001	005	Your fathers, where are they? And the prophets, do they live forever?
038	ZEC	001	006	But my words and my statutes, Which I commanded my servants, the prophets, Did they not overtake your fathers? And they returned and said, Even as Jehovah of hosts thought To do to us according to our ways, and according to doings, So hath he done to us.
038	ZEC	001	007	On the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Sebat, in the second year of Darius, came the word of Jehovah to Zechariah, the son of Barachiah, the son of Iddo, the prophet, saying:
038	ZEC	001	008	I saw in the night, and behold, a man riding upon a red horse; and he stood among the myrtle-trees that were in the deep valley, and behind him were other horses, red, fox-colored, and white.
038	ZEC	001	009	Then I said, What are these, my lord? And the angel that talked with me said to me, I will show thee what these are.
038	ZEC	001	010	And the man that stood among the myrtle-trees answered and said, These are they whom Jehovah hath sent to go to and fro through the earth.
038	ZEC	001	011	And they answered the angel of Jehovah that stood among the myrtle-trees, and said, We have gone to and fro through the earth, and behold, all the earth is still and at rest.
038	ZEC	001	012	Then the angel of Jehovah answered, and said, O Jehovah of hosts, how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, against which thou hast had indignation these threescore and ten years?
038	ZEC	001	013	And Jehovah answered the angel that talked with me good words and comfortable words.
038	ZEC	001	014	And the angel who talked with me said to me: Proclaim thou and say, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with great jealousy,
038	ZEC	001	015	And with great anger am I angry with the nations that are at ease; For I was but a little displeased, And they helped forward the affliction.
038	ZEC	001	016	Therefore thus saith Jehovah: I return to Jerusalem with mercies; My house shall be built in it, Saith Jehovah of hosts, And a measuring-line shall be stretched forth over Jerusalem.
038	ZEC	001	017	Proclaim yet and say, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: My cities shall yet overflow with prosperity, And Jehovah will yet comfort Zion, And will yet choose Jerusalem.
038	ZEC	001	018	Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, four horns.
038	ZEC	001	019	And I said to the angel that talked with me, What mean these? And he answered me, These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.
038	ZEC	001	020	And Jehovah showed me four smiths.
038	ZEC	001	021	Then said I, What come these to do? And he spake, saying, These are the horns which scattered Judah, so that no man lifted up his head; and now these are come to terrify them, to cast out the horns of the nations which lifted up their horn against the land of Judah to scatter it.
038	ZEC	002	001	I lifted up mine eyes again, and looked, and behold, a man with a measuring-line in his hand.
038	ZEC	002	002	Then said I, Whither goest thou? And he said to me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what is the breadth thereof, and what is the length thereof.
038	ZEC	002	003	And behold, the angel who talked with me went forth, and another angel went forth to meet him,
038	ZEC	002	004	and said to him, Run, speak to that young man, saying: Jerusalem shall be inhabited without walls On account of the multitude of men and of cattle within her.
038	ZEC	002	005	And I will be to her, saith Jehovah, A wall of fire round about, And glory will I be within her.
038	ZEC	002	006	Ho! ho! flee ye out of the land of the North, saith Jehovah; For toward the four winds of heaven have I scattered you abroad, saith Jehovah.
038	ZEC	002	007	Ho, Zion, escape, Thou that dwellest with the daughter of Babylon!
038	ZEC	002	008	For thus saith Jehovah of hosts: For glory hath he sent me to the nations which plundered you; (For he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye.)
038	ZEC	002	009	For, behold, I will shake my hand over them, And they shall be a spoil to those that served them; And ye shall know that Jehovah of hosts hath sent me.
038	ZEC	002	010	Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion! For, behold, I will come, And I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith Jehovah;
038	ZEC	002	011	And many nations shall join themselves to Jehovah in that day, And shall be my people; And I will dwell in the midst of thee; And thou shalt know that Jehovah of hosts hath sent me to thee.
038	ZEC	002	012	And Jehovah will possess Judah as his portion in the holy land, And will again choose Jerusalem.
038	ZEC	002	013	Be silent, all flesh, before Jehovah! For he riseth up from his holy habitation.
038	ZEC	003	001	And he showed me Joshua, the high-priest, standing before the angel of Jehovah, and the adversary standing at his right hand, to accuse him.
038	ZEC	003	002	And Jehovah said to the adversary: — Jehovah rebuke thee, thou adversary, Even Jehovah, who hath chosen Jerusalem, rebuke thee! Is not this man a brand plucked out of the fire?
038	ZEC	003	003	Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before the angel.
038	ZEC	003	004	And he [[the angel]] spake and said to them [[the angels]] that stood before him, saying, Take off the filthy garments from him. And to him he said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and will clothe thee with goodly apparel.
038	ZEC	003	005	And I said, Let them set a fair mitre upon his head! And they set a fair mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments. And the angel of Jehovah stood by.
038	ZEC	003	006	And the angel of Jehovah declared to Joshua and said:
038	ZEC	003	007	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: If thou wilt walk in my ways, And if thou wilt keep my charge, Then thou shalt also rule my house, And shalt also keep my courts, And I will give thee guides among these that stand by.
038	ZEC	003	008	Hear now, O Joshua, high-priest, Thou and thy companions, who sit before thee! For they are men that are signs. For, behold, I will cause to come my servant, the Branch.
038	ZEC	003	009	For, behold, the stone which I have laid before Joshua, Upon this one stone shall be seven eyes; Behold, I will engrave the graving thereof, saith Jehovah of hosts; And I will remove the iniquity of this land in one day.
038	ZEC	003	010	In that day, saith Jehovah of hosts, Shall ye invite every one his neighbor Under the vine and under the fig-tree.
038	ZEC	004	001	And the angel that talked with me came again, and awaked me, as a man that is wakened out of his sleep,
038	ZEC	004	002	and said to me, What seest thou? And I said, I have looked, and behold, a chandelier all of gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and its seven lamps upon it, and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are upon the top of it;
038	ZEC	004	003	and two olive-trees by it, one upon the right side of the bowl, and the other upon the left side of it.
038	ZEC	004	004	And I spake, and said to the angel that talked with me, What mean these, my lord?
038	ZEC	004	005	Then the angel who talked with me answered and said to me, Knowest thou not what these mean? And I said, No, my lord.
038	ZEC	004	006	Then he answered and spake to me, saying, This is the word of Jehovah to Zerubbabel, saying: — Not by might, nor by power, But by my spirit, Saith Jehovah of hosts.
038	ZEC	004	007	What art thou, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain! And he shall bring forth the corner-stone amid shoutings, [[The people crying, ]] “Grace, grace be to it!”
038	ZEC	004	008	Moreover, the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:
038	ZEC	004	009	The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house, and his hands shall finish it. And thou shalt know that Jehovah of hosts hath sent me to you.
038	ZEC	004	010	For who hath despised the day of small things? With joy shall the plummet be seen in the hand of Zerubbabel by those seven; they are the eyes of Jehovah, which run to and fro through the whole earth.
038	ZEC	004	011	Then I spake and said to him, What mean these two olive-trees, upon the right side of the chandelier and upon the left side thereof?
038	ZEC	004	012	And I spake the second time, and said to him, What mean these two olive-branches, which are by the side of the two golden tubes which empty the golden oil out of themselves?
038	ZEC	004	013	And he answered me and said, Knowest thou not what these mean? And I said, No, my lord.
038	ZEC	004	014	And he said, These are the two anointed ones that stand before the Lord of all the earth.
038	ZEC	005	001	And I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and behold, a flying roll.
038	ZEC	005	002	And he said to me, What seest thou? And I answered, I see a flying roll; the length thereof is twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof ten cubits.
038	ZEC	005	003	Then said he to me: — This is the curse that goeth forth Over the Face of the whole land; For every one who stealeth shall be cut off from hence, according to it, And every one who sweareth falsely shall be cut off from hence, according to it.
038	ZEC	005	004	I will bring it forth, saith Jehovah of hosts, And it shall enter into the house of the thief, And into the house of him that sweareth falsely by my name; And it shall abide in his house, And shall consume it, with the timber thereof and the stones thereof.
038	ZEC	005	005	Then the angel who talked with me went forth, and said to me, Lift up now thine eyes, and see what this is which goeth forth.
038	ZEC	005	006	And I said, What is it? And he said, This is an ephah which goeth forth. He said, moreover, This is their image through all the land.
038	ZEC	005	007	And behold, a talent of lead was lifted up, and a woman was sitting upon the ephah.
038	ZEC	005	008	And he said, This is the Wickedness. And he cast her into the ephah, and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof.
038	ZEC	005	009	Then lifted I up mine eyes and looked, and behold, there came forth two women, and wind was in their wings; for they had wings like the wings of a stork, and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and heaven.
038	ZEC	005	010	Then said I to the angel who talked with me, Whither do these bear the ephah?
038	ZEC	005	011	And he said to me, To build it a house in the land of Shinar, that it may be fixed there, and set upon its base.
038	ZEC	006	001	And I lifted up mine eyes again, and looked, and, behold, there came four chariots out from between two mountains; and the mountains were mountains of brass.
038	ZEC	006	002	In the first chariot were red horses; and in the second chariot, black horses;
038	ZEC	006	003	and in the third chariot, white horses; and in the fourth chariot, spotted-red horses.
038	ZEC	006	004	Then I spake, and said to the angel that talked with me, What are these, my lord?
038	ZEC	006	005	And the angel answered and said to me, These are the four Winds of heaven, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth.
038	ZEC	006	006	The black horses, which are thereto, go forth into the north country, and the white go forth after them; and the spotted go forth into the south country.
038	ZEC	006	007	And the red ones went forth, and sought to go, even to walk to and fro through the earth. And he said, Go, walk ye to and fro through the earth! So they walked to and fro through the earth.
038	ZEC	006	008	Then he cried to me, and spake to me, saying, Behold, these that go forth toward the land of the North shall execute my wrath against the land of the North.
038	ZEC	006	009	And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:
038	ZEC	006	010	Take from those of the captivity, from Heldai, from Tobijah, and from Jedaiah, and come thou the same day, and go into the house of Josiah, the son of Zephaniah, whither they are come from Babylon;
038	ZEC	006	011	take from them silver and gold, and make a crown, and set it upon the head of Joshua, the son of Josedech, the high-priest,
038	ZEC	006	012	and speak to him, saying, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: — Behold a man whose name is the Branch, He shall spring up from his place, And he shall build the temple of Jehovah.
038	ZEC	006	013	He shall build the temple of Jehovah, And he shall bear the majesty, And sit and rule upon his throne, And be a priest upon his throne, And the counsel of peace shall be between them both.
038	ZEC	006	014	And the crown shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen, the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in the temple of Jehovah.
038	ZEC	006	015	And they that are far off shall come and build in the temple of Jehovah; and ye shall know that Jehovah of hosts hath sent me to you. And this shall come to pass, if ye will diligently obey the voice of Jehovah, your God.
038	ZEC	007	001	And it came to pass, in the fourth year of King Darius, that the word of Jehovah came to Zechariah, on the fourth day of the ninth month, even in Chisleu;
038	ZEC	007	002	when they had sent to the house of God Sherezer and Regem-melech, and their men, to pray before Jehovah,
038	ZEC	007	003	and to speak to the priests that were in the house of Jehovah of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, “Shall I weep in the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done these so many years?”
038	ZEC	007	004	Then came the word of Jehovah of hosts to me, saying,
038	ZEC	007	005	Speak to all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth month and in the seventh month, even those seventy years, did ye at all fast for me, even for me?
038	ZEC	007	006	And when ye eat and drink, is it not ye that eat, and ye that drink?
038	ZEC	007	007	Are not these the words which Jehovah proclaimed by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity, and her cities round about her, and when the South and the Plain were inhabited?
038	ZEC	007	008	And the word of Jehovah came to Zechariah, saying,
038	ZEC	007	009	Thus spake Jehovah of hosts, saying, Judge true judgment, and show mercy and compassion every man to his brother.
038	ZEC	007	010	And the widow, and the orphan, and the stranger, and the poor, oppress not, and meditate not evil against one another in your heart.
038	ZEC	007	011	But they refused to hearken, and showed a refractory shoulder, and made their ears dull, that they might not hear;
038	ZEC	007	012	yea, they made their hearts as an adamant stone, that they might not hear the law, and the words which Jehovah of hosts sent through his spirit by the former prophets. Therefore came great anger from Jehovah of hosts.
038	ZEC	007	013	And as he called and they would not hear, so they called and I would not hear, saith Jehovah of hosts.
038	ZEC	007	014	And I scattered them as with a whirlwind among all the nations, which they knew not. And the land was desolate after them, so that no man passed through, nor returned; and thus the beautiful land was made a desolation.
038	ZEC	008	001	And the word of Jehovah of hosts came to me, saying,
038	ZEC	008	002	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: I have been jealous for Zion with great jealousy, And with great wrath have I been jealous for her.
038	ZEC	008	003	Thus saith Jehovah: I have returned to Zion, And I will dwell in Jerusalem; And Jerusalem shall be called a city of truth, And the mountain of Jehovah of hosts the holy mountain.
038	ZEC	008	004	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: There shall yet old men and old women dwell In the streets of Jerusalem, Every one with his staff in his hand for great age.
038	ZEC	008	005	And the streets of the city shall be full Of boys and girls playing in her streets.
038	ZEC	008	006	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: If it be difficult in the eyes Of the residue of this people in these days, Is it therefore difficult in my eyes, Saith Jehovah of hosts?
038	ZEC	008	007	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Behold, I will save my people From the land of the rising, and from the land of the setting sun.
038	ZEC	008	008	And I will bring them, and they shall dwell in Jerusalem; And they shall be my people, And I will be their God, In truth and in righteousness.
038	ZEC	008	009	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Let your hands be strong, Ye that hear in these days These words by the mouth of the prophets, Who were in the day when the foundation of the house of Jehovah of hosts was laid, The temple, that it might be built.
038	ZEC	008	010	For before these days There was no recompense for men, Nor was there any recompense for beasts; Nor to him that went out, nor to him that came in, was there security from the enemy; For I set all men one against another.
038	ZEC	008	011	But now I will not be as in former days Toward the residue of this people, Saith Jehovah of hosts.
038	ZEC	008	012	For the seed shall be prosperous; The vine shall yield its fruit, And the earth shall yield her increase, And the heavens shall yield their dew; And I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these.
038	ZEC	008	013	And it shall be, that as ye were a curse among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, So will I save you, and ye shall be a blessing. Fear not; let your hands be strong!
038	ZEC	008	014	For thus saith Jehovah of hosts: As I thought to do you evil, When your fathers provoked me to anger, Saith Jehovah of hosts, And I repented not,
038	ZEC	008	015	So have I again thought in these days To do good to Jerusalem, And to the house of Judah. Fear ye not!
038	ZEC	008	016	These are the things which ye shall do: Speak ye every man the truth to his neighbor; Judge according to truth, and for peace in your gates;
038	ZEC	008	017	And meditate not evil against one another in your hearts, And love not a false oath! For all these are things which I hate, saith Jehovah.
038	ZEC	008	018	And the word of Jehovah of hosts came to me, saying,
038	ZEC	008	019	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: The fast of the fourth month, and the fast of the fifth month, And the fast of the seventh month, and the fast of the tenth month, Shall be to the house of Judah for joy and gladness, And cheerful festivals. But love ye truth and peace!
038	ZEC	008	020	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: It shall yet come to pass, that many nations shall come, And the inhabitants of many cities;
038	ZEC	008	021	And the inhabitants of one city shall go to another, saying, “Let us go speedily to pray before Jehovah, And to seek Jehovah of hosts! I will go also!”
038	ZEC	008	022	Then shall come many nations and mighty kingdoms, To seek Jehovah of hosts in Jerusalem, And to pray before Jehovah.
038	ZEC	008	023	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: In those days shall ten men of all languages of the nations take hold, They shall take hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew, Saying, “We will go with you, For we have heard that God is with you.”
038	ZEC	009	001	The prophecy of the word of Jehovah is against the land of Hadrach, And upon Damascus shall it come down, For the eye of Jehovah is over man, And over all the tribes of Israel,
038	ZEC	009	002	And against Hamath, which bordereth thereon, And Tyre and Sidon, though she be very wise.
038	ZEC	009	003	Though Tyre hath built her a fortress, And hath heaped up silver as dust, And fine gold as the mire of the streets,
038	ZEC	009	004	Behold, the Lord will cast her out, And will smite her power into the sea, And she shall be devoured by fire.
038	ZEC	009	005	Askelon shall see it and fear, Gaza also shall see and tremble, And Ekron, because her expectation shall be put to shame. The king shall perish from Gaza, And Askelon shall not be inhabited.
038	ZEC	009	006	And strangers shall dwell in Ashdod, And I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.
038	ZEC	009	007	And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, And his abominations from between his teeth; And even he shall be left for our God, And he shall be as a governor in Judah, And Ekron as a Jebusite.
038	ZEC	009	008	And I will encamp about my house, as a garrison, Against him that passeth by and him that returneth, And no oppressor shall pass through them any more; For now have I seen with my own eyes.
038	ZEC	009	009	Rejoice greatly, daughter of Zion, Shout, daughter of Jerusalem! Behold, thy king cometh to thee; He is just and victorious, Mild, and riding upon an ass, Even upon a colt, the foal of an ass.
038	ZEC	009	010	And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, And the horse from Jerusalem; And the battle-bow shall be cut off. And he shall speak peace to the nations; And his dominion shall be from sea to sea, And from the river to the ends of the earth.
038	ZEC	009	011	As for thee also, on account of thy blood-sealed covenant, I will set thy prisoners free from the pit wherein is no water.
038	ZEC	009	012	Return ye to the strong-hold, ye prisoners of hope! Even this day do I declare it: I will restore double unto thee.
038	ZEC	009	013	For I will bend Judah as a bow for myself; As a bow will I extend Ephraim to the utmost; And I will raise up thy sons, O Zion, Against thy sons, O Greece, And make thee as the sword of a mighty man.
038	ZEC	009	014	And Jehovah shall be seen over them. And his arrow shall go forth as lightning; And the Lord Jehovah shall blow the trumpet, And shall go forth with whirlwinds of the South.
038	ZEC	009	015	Jehovah of hosts shall defend them; And they shall devour, and trample under feet the sling-stones, And they shall drink, and shout as through wine, And they shall be filled like a bowl, like the corners of the altar.
038	ZEC	009	016	And Jehovah, their God, shall save them in that day; He will save his people as a flock; For they shall be as the stones of a crown, lifting themselves up in his land.
038	ZEC	009	017	How great shall be their prosperity, and how great their beauty! Corn shall make the young men thrive, and new wire the maidens.
038	ZEC	010	001	Ask ye of Jehovah rain in the time of the latter rain! It is Jehovah that maketh the lightning; And he will give you abundant showers, To every one the herb of the field.
038	ZEC	010	002	For the teraphim speak falsehood, And the diviners see a lie, And the dreams speak falsehood; Vain are their consolations. Therefore they wander as a flock; They are in distress, because there is no shepherd.
038	ZEC	010	003	My anger is kindled against the shepherds, And the bucks will I punish; For Jehovah of hosts will visit his flock, the house of Judah, And make them as his goodly horse in battle.
038	ZEC	010	004	From him shall come forth the corner-stone, From him the nail, From him the battle-bow; From him shall every leader come forth.
038	ZEC	010	005	And they shall be as mighty men, Who tread down their enemies in battle as the mire of the streets, And they shall fight, because Jehovah is with them, So that the riders on horses shall be confounded.
038	ZEC	010	006	And I will strengthen the house of Judah, And give victory to the house of Joseph, And I will set them in their dwellings, because I have compassion upon them; And they shall be as though I had not cast them off; For I am Jehovah, their God, and I will hear them.
038	ZEC	010	007	And Ephraim shall be as a mighty man, And their heart shall rejoice, as through wine; And their sons shall see it and rejoice, Their hearts shall rejoice in Jehovah.
038	ZEC	010	008	I will whistle for them, and will gather them; for I have redeemed them; And they shall increase as they increased before.
038	ZEC	010	009	Though I scatter them among the nations, Yet in far countries will they remember me; And they shall live with their children, and shall return.
038	ZEC	010	010	And I will bring them back from the land of Egypt, And from Assyria will I gather them; And I will bring them into the land of Gilead and of Lebanon, And there shall not be room enough for them.
038	ZEC	010	011	And he shall pass through the sea of distress, And he shall smite the sea of waves, And all the depths of the river shall be dried up; And the pride of Assyria shall be brought down, And the sceptre of Egypt shall depart.
038	ZEC	010	012	And I will strengthen them through Jehovah, And in his name shall they walk, saith Jehovah.
038	ZEC	011	001	Open thy doors, O Lebanon, That the fire may devour thy cedars!
038	ZEC	011	002	Howl, O cypress, for the cedar falleth! For the lofty ones are destroyed! Howl, O ye oaks of Bashan, For the high forest is come down!
038	ZEC	011	003	Hark! the voice of the howling of the shepherds, Because their glory is destroyed! The voice of the roaring of young lions, Because the pride of Jordan is destroyed!
038	ZEC	011	004	Thus said Jehovah, my God: Feed thou the flock of slaughter,
038	ZEC	011	005	Whose possessors slay them, and hold themselves not guilty, And which they who sell say, “Blessed be Jehovah, for I am rich!” And whose shepherds spare them not.
038	ZEC	011	006	For I will no longer spare The inhabitants of the land, saith Jehovah; But, behold, I will deliver the men Every one into the hand of his neighbor, And into the hand of his king; And they shall smite the land, And I will not deliver out of their hand.
038	ZEC	011	007	So I fed the flock of slaughter, truly a miserable flock. And I took to me two crooks; the one I called Favor, and the other I called Bands; and I fed the flock.
038	ZEC	011	008	And I cut off three shepherds in one month; for I was weary of them, and they also abhorred me.
038	ZEC	011	009	Then I said, I will not feed you; that which dieth, let it die; and that which is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let the rest eat the flesh of one another.
038	ZEC	011	010	And I took my staff Favor, and cut it asunder, that I might break my covenant which I had made with all the nations.
038	ZEC	011	011	And it was broken in that day; and so the poor of the flock, who had regard to me, knew that it was the word of Jehovah.
038	ZEC	011	012	Then I said to them, If it seem good in your eyes, give me my wages; if not, keep them. And they weighed for my wages thirty shekels of silver.
038	ZEC	011	013	And Jehovah said to me, Cast it into the treasury, the goodly price at which I was valued by them. And I took the thirty shekels of silver, and cast them into the house of Jehovah, into the treasury.
038	ZEC	011	014	Then I broke my other crook, even Bands, to break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.
038	ZEC	011	015	And Jehovah said to me: Take to thee yet the instruments of a foolish shepherd.
038	ZEC	011	016	For lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land Who shall not care for those that are perishing, Nor seek that which is gone astray, Nor heal that which is wounded, Nor support that which cannot go; But he shall eat the flesh of the fat, And consume it even to the hoofs.
038	ZEC	011	017	Woe to the foolish shepherd that leaveth the flock! The sword is upon his arm, and upon his right eye; His arm shall surely be withered, And his right eye shall surely be darkened!
038	ZEC	012	001	The prophecy of the word of Jehovah concerning Israel. Thus saith Jehovah, who stretched out the heavens, And laid the foundation of the earth, And formed the spirit of man within him:
038	ZEC	012	002	Behold, I make Jerusalem a cup of giddiness to all the nations round about, And for Judah also shall it be In the siege against Jerusalem.
038	ZEC	012	003	And in that day will I make Jerusalem A burdensome stone for all nations; All that lift it up shall tear themselves, And all the nations of the earth shall gather themselves together against it.
038	ZEC	012	004	In that day, saith Jehovah, I will smite every horse with amazement, And his rider with madness; I will open mine eyes upon the house of Judah, And every horse of the nations will I smite with blindness.
038	ZEC	012	005	Then shall the leaders of Judah say in their heart, “Strong are the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Through Jehovah of hosts, their God.”
038	ZEC	012	006	In that day will I make the leaders of Judah Like a fire-pan among wood, And like a torch of fire in a sheaf, And they shall devour, on the right hand and on the left, All the nations round about. And Jerusalem shall again dwell in her own place at Jerusalem.
038	ZEC	012	007	Jehovah will also save the tents of Judah first, That the glory of the house of David, And the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, May not magnify itself against Judah.
038	ZEC	012	008	In that day shall Jehovah defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem, And he that is feeble among them in that day shall be like David, And the house of David shall be as God, As the angel of Jehovah before them.
038	ZEC	012	009	And it shall come to pass in that day That I will seek to destroy all the nations Which come against Jerusalem.
038	ZEC	012	010	Then will I pour upon the house of David, And upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, A spirit of supplication, and of prayer; And they shall look to me whom they pierced, And they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only son, And shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his first-born.
038	ZEC	012	011	In that day the mourning shall be great in Jerusalem, As the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddo.
038	ZEC	012	012	And the land shall mourn, every family apart; The family of the house of David apart, and their wives apart; The family of the house of Nathan apart, and their wives apart;
038	ZEC	012	013	The family of the house of Levi apart, and their wives apart; The family of the house of Shimei apart, and their wives apart;
038	ZEC	012	014	All the families that remain, Every family apart, and their wives apart.
038	ZEC	013	001	In that day there shall be a fountain opened To the house of David, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, For sin and for uncleanness.
038	ZEC	013	002	And it shall come to pass in that day, Saith Jehovah of hosts, That I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, And they shall no more be remembered; And the prophets also, and the impure spirit, Will I cause to pass out of the land.
038	ZEC	013	003	And it shall come to pass, when any one shall yet prophesy, That his father and mother shall say to him, Even they that begat him, “Thou shalt not live; For thou hast spoken falsehood in the name of Jehovah.” And his father and mother that begat him shall pierce him through when he prophesieth.
038	ZEC	013	004	And it shall come to pass in that day, that the prophet shall be ashamed Every one of his vision when he prophesieth; Neither shall they wear a garment of hair, to deceive.
038	ZEC	013	005	But each shall say, “I am no prophet; I am a man that tilleth the ground; For a man hath purchased me from my youth.”
038	ZEC	013	006	And when one shall say to him, “What are these wounds in thy hands?” He shall answer, “Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.”
038	ZEC	013	007	Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, Even against the man who is my fellow, saith Jehovah of hosts! Smite the shepherd, and let the sheep be scattered! I will also turn my hand against the lambs.
038	ZEC	013	008	And it shall come to pass in all the land, saith Jehovah, That two parts therein shall be cut off and die; But the third part shall be left therein.
038	ZEC	013	009	And I will bring the third part through the fire, And will refine them, as silver is refined, And will try them, as gold is tried; They shall call upon me, and I will hear them; I will say, “It is my people.” And they shall say, “Jehovah is our God.”
038	ZEC	014	001	Behold, the day of Jehovah cometh, When thy spoil shall be divided in the midst of thee.
038	ZEC	014	002	For I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle; And the city shall be taken, And the houses shall be rifled, And the women shall be ravished; And half of the city shall go forth into captivity, And the residue of the people shall not be cut off from the city.
038	ZEC	014	003	Then shall Jehovah go forth, And fight against those nations, As he once fought in the day of battle.
038	ZEC	014	004	And his feet shall stand in that day upon the Mount of Olives, Which is before Jerusalem on the east; And the Mount of Olives shall be cloven in the middle of it, eastward and westward, Into a very great valley; And half of the mountain shall remove toward the north, And half of it toward the south.
038	ZEC	014	005	And ye shall flee through the valley of my mountains, For the valley of the mountains shall reach to Azal; Yea, ye shall flee, as ye fled before the earthquake In the days of Uzziah, king of Judah. And Jehovah, my God, will come, And all his holy ones with him.
038	ZEC	014	006	And it shall come to pass in that day That there shall he no light, but cold and ice;
038	ZEC	014	007	And there shall be one day, (Known to Jehovah is it, ) It shall be neither day nor night; But at the time of evening there shall be light.
038	ZEC	014	008	And it shall come to pass in that day That living waters shall go out from Jerusalem, Half of them toward the eastern sea, And half of them toward the western sea; In summer and in winter shall they be.
038	ZEC	014	009	And Jehovah shall be king over all the earth; In that day shall Jehovah be one, and his name one.
038	ZEC	014	010	The whole land shall be turned into a plain, From Geba to Rimmon, south of Jerusalem; And the city shall be exalted and inhabited in her place, From the gate of Benjamin to the place of the former gate, And to the corner gate, And from the tower of Hananeel to the king's wine-presses.
038	ZEC	014	011	Men shall dwell therein, And there shall be no more destruction; But Jerusalem shall dwell securely.
038	ZEC	014	012	And this shall be the plague With which Jehovah will smite all the nations Which warred against Jerusalem: Their flesh shall consume away while they stand upon their feet, And their eyes shall consume away in their sockets, And their tongue shall consume away in their mouth.
038	ZEC	014	013	And it shall come to pass in that day, That there shall be a great tumult among them from Jehovah; And they shall lay hold every one on the hand of his neighbor, And his hand shall rise up against the hand of his neighbor.
038	ZEC	014	014	And Judah also shall fight against Jerusalem; But the wealth of all the nations round about shall be gathered together, Gold and silver and apparel in great abundance.
038	ZEC	014	015	And so shall be the plague of the horse, Of the mule, of the camel, and of the ass, And of every beast which shall be in those camps, Even as this plague.
038	ZEC	014	016	And it shall be, that every one that is left Of all the nations which come against Jerusalem, Even they shall go up, from year to year, To worship the King, Jehovah of hosts, And to keep the feast of tabernacles.
038	ZEC	014	017	And it shall be that whoso will not go up, Of the families of the earth, to Jerusalem, To worship the King, Jehovah of hosts, Upon them shall be no rain.
038	ZEC	014	018	And if the family of Egypt go not up, and come not, Then not for them shall there be water. The plague shall come upon them With which Jehovah shall smite the nations Which go not up to keep the feast of tabernacles.
038	ZEC	014	019	This shall be the punishment of Egypt, And the punishment of all the nations That come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles.
038	ZEC	014	020	In that day, upon the bells of the horses Shall be written, “Holy to Jehovah.” And the pots in the house of Jehovah Shall be as the bowls before the altar.
038	ZEC	014	021	And every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah Shall be holy to Jehovah of hosts; And all that sacrifice shall come, And shall take of them, and seethe therein. And there shall be no more a trader In the house of Jehovah of hosts, in that day.

# BOOK	039	MAL	Malachi	Malachi
039	MAL	001	001	The prophecy of the word of Jehovah, concerning Israel, by Malachi.
039	MAL	001	002	I have loved you, saith Jehovah. But ye say, “Wherein hast thou loved us?” Was not Esau Jacob's brother, saith Jehovah? Yet I loved Jacob,
039	MAL	001	003	And Esau I hated; And I made his mountains a desolation, And his inheritance to be habitations of the desert.
039	MAL	001	004	Although Edom say, “We are ruined, Yet will we build again the desolate places.” Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: They may build, but I will throw down; And men shall call them “The impious land, The people against whom Jehovah hath indignation forever.”
039	MAL	001	005	And your eyes shall see it, and ye shall say, “Great is Jehovah beyond the borders of Israel!”
039	MAL	001	006	A son honoreth his father, And a servant his master; If I, then, be a father, where is mine honor? And if I be a master, where is my fear? Saith Jehovah of hosts to you, ye priests that despise my name. Ye say, “Wherein do we despise thy name?”
039	MAL	001	007	Ye bring polluted food to mine altar. And ye say, “Wherein do we pollute thee?” In that ye say, “The table of Jehovah is contemptible.”
039	MAL	001	008	For when ye bring the blind for sacrifice, [[ye say, ]] “It is not evil.” And when ye offer the lame and the sick, [[Ye say, ]] “It is not evil.” Offer it, then, to thy governor; Will he be pleased with thee, Or have regard to thee? Saith Jehovah of hosts.
039	MAL	001	009	And now, I pray you, beseech God to be gracious unto us! Since such things are done by you, Will he have regard to you, Saith Jehovah of hosts?
039	MAL	001	010	O that some one of you would close the doors, That ye might not kindle the fire upon mine altar in vain! I have no pleasure in you, saith Jehovah of hosts, Neither will I accept an offering at your hand.
039	MAL	001	011	For from the rising of the sun even to the going down of the same My name shall be great among the nations. And in every place shall incense be offered to my name, And a pure offering; For my name shall be great among the nations, Saith Jehovah of hosts.
039	MAL	001	012	But ye profane it, In that ye say, “The table of Jehovah is polluted, And what is offered thereon, even its food, is contemptible.”
039	MAL	001	013	Ye say also, “Behold, what weariness!” And ye snuff at it, Saith Jehovah of hosts; And ye bring that which is plundered, and lame, and sick, And present it for an offering; Shall I accept it at your hand? Saith Jehovah.
039	MAL	001	014	Cursed be the deceiver, Who hath in his flock a male, And yet voweth and sacrificeth to Jehovah that which is marred; For I am a great king, saith Jehovah of hosts; And my name is terrible among the nations.
039	MAL	002	001	And now to you, O ye priests, is this commandment:
039	MAL	002	002	If ye will not hearken, If ye will not lay it to heart, To give glory to my name, saith Jehovah of hosts, I will send a curse upon you, And I will curse your blessings; Yea, I have cursed them already, Because ye do not lay it to heart.
039	MAL	002	003	Behold, I will rebuke your seed, And I will scatter dung in your faces, The dung of your solemn feasts, And ye shall be carried to it.
039	MAL	002	004	And ye shall know that I have sent to you this commandment, That my covenant may remain with Levi, Saith Jehovah of hosts.
039	MAL	002	005	My covenant was with him for life and peace, Which I gave to him for the fear wherewith he feared me, And was afraid before my name.
039	MAL	002	006	The law of truth was in his mouth, And unrighteousness was not found in his lips; He walked with me in truth and equity, And turned many away from iniquity.
039	MAL	002	007	For the lips of the priest should keep knowledge, And men should seek the law from his mouth; For he is the messenger of Jehovah of hosts.
039	MAL	002	008	But ye have departed from the way, Ye have caused many to stumble at the law, And ye have made void the covenant with Levi, Saith Jehovah of hosts.
039	MAL	002	009	Therefore will I also make you Despicable and base before all the people; According as ye have not kept my ways. But have had respect to persons in the law.
039	MAL	002	010	Have we not all one Father? Hath not one God created us? Why should we deal treacherously one against another, And profane the covenant made with our fathers?
039	MAL	002	011	Judah hath dealt treacherously, And an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem. For Judah hath profaned the holy people of Jehovah, which he loveth, And hath married the daughter of a strange god.
039	MAL	002	012	Jehovah will cut off the man that doeth this, Him that waketh and him that answereth, from the tents of Jacob, And him that bringeth an offering to Jehovah of hosts.
039	MAL	002	013	And this also ye do: Ye cover the altar of Jehovah with tears, With weeping and with groans, So that he no more hath regard to the offering, Nor receiveth it with good-will from your hand.
039	MAL	002	014	Yet ye say, “Wherefore?” It is because Jehovah has been a witness between thee and the wife of thy youth, Against whom thou hast dealt unfaithfully, Although she was thy companion and thy covenanted wife.
039	MAL	002	015	But did not He make one only? And yet had he a residue of the spirit; And wherefore one? He sought a godly race. Therefore take heed to your spirit, And be not unfaithful to the wife of thy youth!
039	MAL	002	016	For I hate him that putteth away, Saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, And him that covereth his garment with violence, Saith Jehovah of hosts. Therefore take heed to your spirit, and be not unfaithful.
039	MAL	002	017	Ye have wearied Jehovah with your words; Yet ye say, “Wherein have we wearied him?” In that ye say, “Every one of them that do evil Is good in the sight of Jehovah, And in them he hath delight”; Or, “Where is the God of judgment?”
039	MAL	003	001	Behold, I will send my messenger, And he shall prepare the way before me; And the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple; And the messenger of the covenant, whom ye desire, Behold, he shall come, saith Jehovah of hosts.
039	MAL	003	002	But who shall abide the day of his coming? And who shall stand when he appeareth? For he shall be like the fire of the refiner, And like the soap of the fuller.
039	MAL	003	003	And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, And he shall purify the sons of Levi, And shall refine them as gold and silver, That, being holy to Jehovah, they may bring an offering in righteousness.
039	MAL	003	004	Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasing to Jehovah, As in the days of old, And as in former years.
039	MAL	003	005	And I will come near to you to judgment; And I will be a swift witness Against sorcerers, and against adulterers, and against false swearers, And against those who defraud the hireling of his hire, And oppress the widow and the fatherless, And turn aside the stranger from his right, And fear not me, saith Jehovah of hosts.
039	MAL	003	006	For I am Jehovah; I change not; Therefore, ye sons of Jacob, are ye not consumed.
039	MAL	003	007	From the days of your fathers have ye turned aside from my statutes, And have not kept them; Return to me, and I will return to you, Saith Jehovah of hosts. But ye say, “Wherein shall we return?”
039	MAL	003	008	Shall a man rob God, That ye have robbed me? But ye say, “Wherein have we robbed thee?” In tithes and offerings.
039	MAL	003	009	Ye are cursed with a curse, For ye have robbed me, even this whole nation.
039	MAL	003	010	Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, That there be food in my house; And try me now in this, Saith Jehovah of hosts, Whether I will not open to you the windows of heaven, And pour out upon you a blessing, until there is none left.
039	MAL	003	011	And I will rebuke for you the devourer, And he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground, Nor shall your vine be barren in the field, Saith Jehovah of hosts.
039	MAL	003	012	And all nations shall call you blessed; For ye shall be a delightful land, Saith Jehovah of hosts.
039	MAL	003	013	Your words have been bold against me, saith Jehovah; Yet ye say, “What have we spoken against thee?”
039	MAL	003	014	Ye have said, “It is a vain thing to serve God”; And, “What profit is it that we have kept his ordinances, And that we have walked mournfully before Jehovah of hosts?
039	MAL	003	015	Therefore we call the proud happy; Yea, they that do wickedness are built up; Yea, they tempt God, and are delivered.”
039	MAL	003	016	Then they that feared Jehovah spake to one another, And Jehovah gave ear and heard; And a book of remembrance was written before him, For them that feared Jehovah, And that thought upon his name.
039	MAL	003	017	And they shall be to me, saith Jehovah of hosts, In the day which I appoint, as my own possession; And I will spare them, As a father spareth his own son that serveth him.
039	MAL	003	018	Then shall ye return and see What is the difference between the righteous and the wicked, Between him who serveth God And him who serveth him not.
039	MAL	004	001	For, behold, the day cometh, which shall burn as an oven; Then shall all the proud, And all that do wickedness, be stubble; And the day that cometh shall burn them up, Saith Jehovah of hosts; It shall leave them neither root nor branch.
039	MAL	004	002	But for you that fear my name Shall the sun of salvation arise With healing under his wings. And ye shall go forth and leap for joy, Like calves of the stall.
039	MAL	004	003	And ye shall tread down the wicked; For they shall be as dust under the soles of your feet In the day which I appoint, saith Jehovah of hosts.
039	MAL	004	004	Remember ye the law of Moses, my servant, Which I commanded him in Horeb for all Israel, My statutes and precepts!
039	MAL	004	005	Behold, I will send you Elijah, the prophet, Before the day of Jehovah come, The great and terrible day.
039	MAL	004	006	He shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, And the heart of the children to their fathers, That I may not come And smite the land with a curse.

040	MAT	001	015	and Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob;
040	MAT	001	016	and Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.
040	MAT	001	017	So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David to the removal to Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the removal to Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations.
040	MAT	001	018	Now the birth of Jesus Christ was in this manner. When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found to be with child by the Holy Spirit.
040	MAT	001	019	Then Joseph her husband, being righteous, and not willing to expose her to shame, purposed to put her away privately.
040	MAT	001	020	But while he thought on these things, lo! an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph, son of David, fear not to take to thee Mary thy wife; for that which is conceived in her is by the Holy Spirit.
040	MAT	001	021	And she will bear a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus; for he will save his people from their sins.
040	MAT	001	022	Now all this took place, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying,
040	MAT	001	023	“Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and shall bear a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel;” that is, when interpreted, God-is with-us.
040	MAT	001	024	Then Joseph, on waking up from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took to him his wife;
040	MAT	001	025	and he knew her not till she had brought forth a son: and he called his name Jesus.
040	MAT	002	001	Now when Jesus had been born in Bethlehem of Judaea, in the days of Herod the king, lo! there came magians from the East to Jerusalem,
040	MAT	002	002	saying, Where is the king of the Jews that hath been born? for we saw his star in the East, and came to do him homage.
040	MAT	002	003	But when Herod the king heard of these things, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him;
040	MAT	002	004	and assembling all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born.
040	MAT	002	005	And they said to him, In Bethlehem of Judaea; for thus it is written by the prophet:
040	MAT	002	006	“And thou Bethlehem, land of Judah, art by no means least among the princes of Judah; for out of thee shall come a ruler, who shall feed my people Israel.”
040	MAT	002	007	Then Herod, having privately called the magians ascertained from them exactly the time when the star appeared.
040	MAT	002	008	And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search carefully for the child; and when ye have found him, bring me word, that I also may go and do him homage.
040	MAT	002	009	When they had heard the king, they departed. And lo! the star, which they had seen in the East, went before them, till it came and stood over where the child was.
040	MAT	002	010	When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy;
040	MAT	002	011	and when they had come into the house, they saw the child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and did homage to him; and opening their treasures, they presented him gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh.
040	MAT	002	012	And having been warned by God in a dream not to return to Herod, they went back to their own country another way.
040	MAT	002	013	And when they had gone, lo! an angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and remain there until I speak to thee; for Herod will seek the child, to destroy him.
040	MAT	002	014	And he arose, and took the child and his mother by night, and went to Egypt;
040	MAT	002	015	and was there until the death of Herod; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, “I called my son out of Egypt.”
040	MAT	002	016	Then Herod, when he saw that he had been deceived by the magians, was greatly enraged; and sent forth, and slew all the male children that were in Bethlehem, and in all its borders, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had ascertained from the magians.
040	MAT	002	017	Then was fulfilled that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet, saying,
040	MAT	002	018	“A voice was heard in Ramah, weeping, and great mourning; Rachel weeping for her children, and refusing to be comforted, because they were no more.”
040	MAT	002	019	But when Herod was dead, lo! an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,
040	MAT	002	020	saying, Arise, and take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel; for they who sought the child's life are dead.
040	MAT	002	021	And he arose, and took the child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.
040	MAT	002	022	But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning in Judaea in the place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither; and being warned by God in a dream, he withdrew into the parts of Galilee,
040	MAT	002	023	and came and took up his abode in a city called Nazareth; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophets, “He will be called a Nazarene,”
040	MAT	003	001	In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea,
040	MAT	003	002	saying, Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
040	MAT	003	003	For this is he that was spoken of through Isaiah the prophet, saying, “The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare the way of the Lord, make straight his paths!”
040	MAT	003	004	And John himself had his raiment of camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his food was locusts and wild honey.
040	MAT	003	005	Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the country about the Jordan;
040	MAT	003	006	and were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.
040	MAT	003	007	But seeing many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to be baptized, he said to them, Brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?
040	MAT	003	008	Bring forth therefore fruit worthy of repentance,
040	MAT	003	009	and think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham for our father; for I say to you, that God is able out of these stones to raise up children to Abraham.
040	MAT	003	010	And already is the axe lying at the root of the trees; every tree therefore that beareth not good fruit is to be cut down, and cast into the fire.
040	MAT	003	011	I indeed baptize you in water, for repentance; but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to bear; he will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and in fire.
040	MAT	003	012	His winnowing-shovel is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing-floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire.
040	MAT	003	013	Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized by him.
040	MAT	003	014	But John opposed him, saying, I have need to be baptized by thee, and dost thou come to me?
040	MAT	003	015	And Jesus answering said to him, Suffer it now; for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness. Then he suffered him.
040	MAT	003	016	And Jesus, as soon as he was baptized, went up from the water; and, lo! the heavens were opened, and he saw the Spirit of God, descending like a dove, coming upon him.
040	MAT	003	017	And lo! a voice from the heavens, saying, “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.”
040	MAT	004	001	Then was Jesus led up by the Spirit into the wilderness, to be tempted by the Devil.
040	MAT	004	002	And when he had tasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward hungry.
040	MAT	004	003	And the tempter came and said to him, If thou art the Son of God, command that these stones become loaves of bread.
040	MAT	004	004	But he answered and said, It is written, “Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceedeth from the mouth of God.”
040	MAT	004	005	Then the Devil taketh him into the holy city, and setteth him on the pinnacle of the temple;
040	MAT	004	006	and saith to him, If thou art the Son of God, cast thyself down; for it is written, “He will give his angels charge concerning thee; and in their hands they will bear thee up, that thou mayst not dash thy foot against a stone.”
040	MAT	004	007	Jesus said to him, Again it is written, “Thou shalt not make trial of the Lord thy God.”
040	MAT	004	008	Again, the Devil taketh him m an exceeding high mountain, and showeth him all the kingdoms of the world, and their glory;
040	MAT	004	009	and said to him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.
040	MAT	004	010	Then saith Jesus to him, Be gone, Satan! for it is written, “Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.”
040	MAT	004	011	Then the Devil leaveth him; and lo! angels came and ministered to him.
040	MAT	004	012	Now when Jesus heard that John had been cast into prison, he withdrew into Galilee.
040	MAT	004	013	And leaving Nazara, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, on the shore of the lake, in the borders of Zebulun and Naphtali;
040	MAT	004	014	that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,
040	MAT	004	015	“The land of Zebulun, and the land of Naphtali, by the way of the lake beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles,
040	MAT	004	016	the people that sat in darkness, saw a great light; and upon those who sat in the region and shadow of death, light arose.”
040	MAT	004	017	From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
040	MAT	004	018	And while walking by the lake of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the lake; for they were fishers.
040	MAT	004	019	And he saith to them, Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men.
040	MAT	004	020	And they immediately left their nets, and followed him.
040	MAT	004	021	And going on from thence, he saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them.
040	MAT	004	022	And they immediately left the boat and their father, and followed him.
040	MAT	004	023	And he went round the whole of Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the glad tidings of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people.
040	MAT	004	024	And his fame went forth into all Syria; and they brought to him all that were sick, afflicted with various diseases and torments, and those who were possessed by demons, and lunatics, and those who were struck with palsy; and he healed them.
040	MAT	004	025	And great multitudes followed him from Galilee and Decapolis and Jerusalem and Judaea, and from beyond the Jordan.
040	MAT	005	001	And seeing the multitudes, he went up into the mountain; and when he had sat down, his disciples came to him.
040	MAT	005	002	And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying: —
040	MAT	005	003	Blessed are the poor in spirit; for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
040	MAT	005	004	Blessed are they who mourn; for they will be comforted.
040	MAT	005	005	Blessed are the meek; for they will inherit the earth.
040	MAT	005	006	Blessed are they who hunger and thirst after righteousness; for they will be filled.
040	MAT	005	007	Blessed are the merciful; for they will obtain mercy.
040	MAT	005	008	Blessed are the pure in heart; for they will see God.
040	MAT	005	009	Blessed are the peace-makers; for they will be called sons of God.
040	MAT	005	010	Blessed are they who are persecuted for righteousness' sake; for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
040	MAT	005	011	Blessed are ye, when men revile you, and persecute you, and say every thing that is bad against you, falsely, for my sake.
040	MAT	005	012	Rejoice, and be exceeding glad; for great is your reward in heaven; for so did they persecute the prophets that were before you.
040	MAT	005	013	Ye are the salt of the earth. But if the salt have lost its savor, wherewith shall itself be salted? It is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot by men.
040	MAT	005	014	Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid;
040	MAT	005	015	nor do men light a lamp, and put it under the bushel, but on the lamp-stand; and it giveth light to all that are in the house.
040	MAT	005	016	In like manner let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.
040	MAT	005	017	Think not that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets: I came not to destroy, but to fulfill.
040	MAT	005	018	For truly do I say to you, Not till heaven and earth pass away, shall one jot or one tittle pass from the Law, till all be fulfilled.
040	MAT	005	019	Whoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, will be called the least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever shall do and teach them, he will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
040	MAT	005	020	For I say to you, Unless your righteousness shall exceed that of the scribes and Pharisees, ye will not enter the kingdom of heaven.
040	MAT	005	021	Ye have heard that it was said to them of old time, “Thou shalt not kill; and whoever shall kill, shall be in danger of the Judges.”
040	MAT	005	022	But I say to you, that whoever is angry with his brother shall be in danger of the Judges; and whoever shall say to his brother, Simpleton! shall be in danger of the Council; and whoever shall say, Fool! shall be in danger of hell-fire.
040	MAT	005	023	Therefore, if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there remember that thy brother hath aught against thee,
040	MAT	005	024	leave there thy gift before the altar, and go away; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.
040	MAT	005	025	Agree with thine adversary at law quickly, while thou art on the road with him; lest the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.
040	MAT	005	026	Truly do I say to thee, Thou wilt not come out thence, till thou hast paid the last farthing.
040	MAT	005	027	Ye have heard that it was said, “Thou shalt not commit adultery.”
040	MAT	005	028	But I say to you, that whoever looketh on a woman to lust after her, hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.
040	MAT	005	029	And if thy right eye cause thee to offend, pluck it out, and cast it from thee; for it is better for thee that one of thy members should perish, than that thy whole body should be cast into hell.
040	MAT	005	030	And if thy right hand cause thee to offend, cut it off, and cast it from thee; for it is better for thee that one of thy members should perish, than that thy whole body should go away into hell.
040	MAT	005	031	And it was said, “Whoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement.”
040	MAT	005	032	But I say to you, that whoever putteth away his wife, unless it be on account of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery; and whoever shall marry her when put away, committeth adultery.
040	MAT	005	033	Again ye have heard that it was said to them of old time, “Thou shalt not swear falsely, but shalt perform to the Lord thine oaths.”
040	MAT	005	034	But I say to you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven, for it is the throne of God;
040	MAT	005	035	nor by the earth, for it is his footstool; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the Great King;
040	MAT	005	036	nor shalt thou swear by thy head, for thou canst not make one hair white or black.
040	MAT	005	037	But let your language be, Yea, yea; Nay; nay; for whatever is more than these cometh of evil.
040	MAT	005	038	Ye have heard that it was said, “An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.”
040	MAT	005	039	But I say to you, that ye resist not the evil-doer; but whoever smiteth thee on the right cheek, turn to him the other also;
040	MAT	005	040	and if any one intends to sue thee at the law, and take thy coat, give up to him thy cloak also;
040	MAT	005	041	and whoever shall compel thee to go one mile, go with him two.
040	MAT	005	042	Give to him that asketh of thee; and from him that would borrow of thee, turn not away.
040	MAT	005	043	Ye have heard that it was said, “Thou shalt love thy neighbor, and hate thine enemy.”
040	MAT	005	044	But I say to you, Love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you;
040	MAT	005	045	that ye may become sons of your Father who is in heaven; for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.
040	MAT	005	046	For if ye love those who love you, what reward have ye? Do not even the publicans the same?
040	MAT	005	047	And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye that excelleth? Do not even the heathen the same?
040	MAT	005	048	Be ye therefore perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
040	MAT	006	001	But take heed that ye do not your righteousness before men, to be seen by them; otherwise ye have no reward with your Father who is in heaven.
040	MAT	006	002	Therefore when thou doest alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Truly do I say to you, They have received their reward.
040	MAT	006	003	But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth;
040	MAT	006	004	that thine alms may be in secret; and thy Father, who seeth in secret, will reward thee.
040	MAT	006	005	And when ye pray, ye shall not be as the hypocrites are; for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen by men. Truly do I say to you, They have received their reward.
040	MAT	006	006	But do thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and, when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father who is in secret; and thy Father, who seeth in secret, will reward thee.
040	MAT	006	007	But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do; for they think that they shall be heard for the multitude of their words.
040	MAT	006	008	Be not ye therefore like them; for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.
040	MAT	006	009	After this manner therefore pray ye: —Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name;
040	MAT	006	010	thy kingdom come; thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven;
040	MAT	006	011	give us this day our daily bread;
040	MAT	006	012	and forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors;
040	MAT	006	013	and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
040	MAT	006	014	For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you;
040	MAT	006	015	but if ye do not forgive men, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.
040	MAT	006	016	Moreover, when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance; for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear to men to be fasting. Truly do I say to you, They have received their reward.
040	MAT	006	017	But do thou, when thou fastest, anoint thy head, and wash thy face;
040	MAT	006	018	that thou appear not to men to be fasting, but to thy Father who is in secret; and thy Father, who seeth in secret, will reward thee.
040	MAT	006	019	Lay not up for yourselves treasures on earth, where the moth and rust consume, and where thieves break through and steal;
040	MAT	006	020	but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust consumeth, and where thieves do not break through nor steal.
040	MAT	006	021	For where thy treasure is, there will thy heart be also.
040	MAT	006	022	The eye is the lamp of the body. If thine eye he clear, thy whole body will be in light;
040	MAT	006	023	but if thine eye be disordered, thy whole body will be in darkness. If then the light that is within thee is darkness, how great that darkness!
040	MAT	006	024	No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate one, and love the other; or else he will cleave to one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.
040	MAT	006	025	Therefore I say to you, Be not anxious for your life, what ye shall eat; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than food, and the body than raiment?
040	MAT	006	026	Behold the birds of the air, that they sow not, nor reap, nor gather into barns; and your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are not ye of much greater value than they?
040	MAT	006	027	But who of you by anxious thought can add to his life one cubit?
040	MAT	006	028	And why are ye anxious about raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow. They toil not, neither do they spin;
040	MAT	006	029	and yet I say to you, that not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed like one of these.
040	MAT	006	030	And if God so clothes the herbage of the field, which today is, and tomorrow is cast into an oven, will he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?
040	MAT	006	031	Therefore be not anxious, saying, What shall we eat, or what shall we drink, or wherewith shall we he clothed?
040	MAT	006	032	For after all these things do the gentiles seek; for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.
040	MAT	006	033	But seek first his kingdom, and his righteousness; and all these things will also be given you.
040	MAT	006	034	Be not then anxious about the morrow; for the morrow will be anxious about itself. Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof.
040	MAT	007	001	Judge not, that ye be not judged.
040	MAT	007	002	For with what judgment ye judge, ye will be judged; and with what measure ye mete, it will be measured to you.
040	MAT	007	003	And why dost thou look at the mote that is in thy brother's eye, and not perceive the beam in thine own eye?
040	MAT	007	004	Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me take the mote out of thine eye; when, lo! the beam is in thine own eye?
040	MAT	007	005	Hypocrite! first cast the beam out of thine own eye; and then wilt thou see clearly to take the mote out of thy brother's eye.
040	MAT	007	006	Give not that which is holy to dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine; lest they trample them under their feet, and turn upon you and rend you.
040	MAT	007	007	Ask, and it will be given you; seek, and ye will find; knock, and the door will be opened to you.
040	MAT	007	008	For every one that asketh, receiveth; and he that seeketh, findeth; and to him that knocketh, the door will be opened.
040	MAT	007	009	Or what man is there of you, who, if his son ask for bread, will give him a stone?
040	MAT	007	010	or, if he ask for a fish, will give him a serpent?
040	MAT	007	011	If ye then, though evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to them that ask him!
040	MAT	007	012	All things, then, whatever ye would that men should do to you, do ye also so to them; for this is the Law and the Prophets.
040	MAT	007	013	Enter in at the strait gate; for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction; and many are they who go in thereat.
040	MAT	007	014	For strait is the gate, and narrow the way, that leadeth to life; and few are they who find it.
040	MAT	007	015	Beware of the false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly are ravening wolves.
040	MAT	007	016	Ye may know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?
040	MAT	007	017	So every good tree beareth good fruit; but a bad tree beareth bad fruit.
040	MAT	007	018	A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor call a bad tree bear good fruit.
040	MAT	007	019	Every tree that beareth not good fruit is cut down, and cast into the fire.
040	MAT	007	020	So then ye may know them by their fruits.
040	MAT	007	021	Not every one that saith to me, Lord, Lord, will enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father who is in heaven.
040	MAT	007	022	Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in thy name, and in thy name cast out demons, and in thy name work many miracles?
040	MAT	007	023	And then will I declare to them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.
040	MAT	007	024	Every one then that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, shall be likened to a wise man, who built his house upon a rock;
040	MAT	007	025	and the rain descended, and the streams came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not; for it was founded upon a rock.
040	MAT	007	026	And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened to a foolish man, who built his house upon the sand;
040	MAT	007	027	and the rain descended, and the streams came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell; and great was its fall.
040	MAT	007	028	And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, that the multitudes were astonished at his teaching.
040	MAT	007	029	For he taught them as having authority, and not as their scribes.
040	MAT	008	001	When he had come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him.
040	MAT	008	002	And lo! there came a leper and bowed down before him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst cleanse me.
040	MAT	008	003	And he put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be thou cleansed. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.
040	MAT	008	004	And Jesus saith to him, See thou tell no one; but go, show thyself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.
040	MAT	008	005	And when he had entered into Capernaum, there came to him a centurion, beseeching him,
040	MAT	008	006	and saying, Lord, my servant lieth at home palsied, sorely tormented.
040	MAT	008	007	He saith to him, I will come and heal him.
040	MAT	008	008	But the centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldst come under my roof; but only command with a word, and my servant will be made well.
040	MAT	008	009	For even I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me; and I say to this one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.
040	MAT	008	010	When Jesus heard this, he marveled, and said to those who followed, Truly do I say to you, Not even in Israel have I found such faith.
040	MAT	008	011	And I say to you, that many will come from the east and the west, and recline at table with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.
040	MAT	008	012	But the sons of the kingdom will go out into the outer darkness; there will be wailing and gnashing of teeth.
040	MAT	008	013	And Jesus said to the centurion, Go thy way; as thou hast believed, so be it done to thee. And the servant was made well in that hour.
040	MAT	008	014	And when Jesus had come into Peter's house, he saw his wife's mother lying sick of a fever.
040	MAT	008	015	And he touched her hand, and the fever left her; and she arose, and waited on him.
040	MAT	008	016	And when evening came, they brought to him many that were possessed by demons; and he cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all that were sick;
040	MAT	008	017	that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying, “He himself took our infirmities, and bore our diseases.”
040	MAT	008	018	And Jesus, seeing great multitudes about him, gave orders to depart to the other side.
040	MAT	008	019	And a certain scribe came and said to him, Teacher, I will follow thee wherever thou goest.
040	MAT	008	020	And Jesus saith to him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have lodging-places; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.
040	MAT	008	021	And another of the disciples said to him, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.
040	MAT	008	022	But he saith to him, Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead.
040	MAT	008	023	And when he had gone on board the boat, his disciples followed him.
040	MAT	008	024	And, lo! a great tempest arose on the lake, so that the boat was almost covered by the waves; but he was sleeping.
040	MAT	008	025	And they came and awoke him, saying, Lord, save! we are perishing.
040	MAT	008	026	And he saith to them, Why are ye fearful, ye of little faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the waves; and there was a great calm.
040	MAT	008	027	And the men marveled, saying, What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the waves obey him?
040	MAT	008	028	And when he had come to the other side, into the country of the Gadarenes, there met him two men possessed by demons, coming out of the tombs, exceedingly fierce, so that no one could pass by that way.
040	MAT	008	029	And lo! they cried out, saying, What have we to do with thee, Son of God? Didst thou come here to torment us before the time?
040	MAT	008	030	Now there was at a distance from them a herd of many swine feeding.
040	MAT	008	031	And the demons besought him, saying, If thou cast us out, send us into the herd of swine.
040	MAT	008	032	And he said to them, Go. And they came out, and went into the swine. And lo! the whole herd rushed down the steep into the lake, and perished in the waters.
040	MAT	008	033	And the herdsmen fled, and went away into the city, and told everything, and what had happened to the men possessed by demons.
040	MAT	008	034	And lo! the whole city came out to meet Jesus; and when they saw him, they besought him to depart from their borders.
040	MAT	009	001	And going on board a boat, he crossed over, and came to his own city.
040	MAT	009	002	And lo! they brought to him a man that was palsied, lying on a bed. And Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the palsied man, Be of good cheer, son; thy sins are forgiven.
040	MAT	009	003	And lo! some of the scribes said within themselves, This man is blaspheming.
040	MAT	009	004	And Jesus seeing their thoughts, said, Wherefore have ye evil thoughts in your hearts?
040	MAT	009	005	For which is easier? to say, Thy sins are forgiven? or to say, Arise, and walk?
040	MAT	009	006	But that ye may know that the Son of Man hath authority on earth to forgive sins, —then he saith to the palsied man, —Arise, take up thy bed, and go to thy house.
040	MAT	009	007	And he arose, and went away to his house.
040	MAT	009	008	And when the multitudes saw it, they were struck with fear, and gave glory to God, who had given such power to men.
040	MAT	009	009	And as Jesus passed on from thence, he saw a man, named Matthew, sitting at the custom-house; and he saith to him, Follow me. And he arose and followed him.
040	MAT	009	010	And it came to pass, as he was reclining at table in the house, lo! many publicans and sinners came and reclined with Jesus and his disciples.
040	MAT	009	011	And when the Pharisees saw it, they said to his disciples, Why doth your teacher eat with the publicans and sinners?
040	MAT	009	012	But when he heard that, he said, They who are well do not need a physician, but they who are sick.
040	MAT	009	013	But go ye and learn what this meaneth: “I desire mercy, and not sacrifice.” For I came not to call righteous men, but sinners.
040	MAT	009	014	Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast, and thy disciples fast not?
040	MAT	009	015	And Jesus said to them, Can the companions of the bridegroom mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come, when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and then will they fast.
040	MAT	009	016	No one putteth a patch of undressed cloth on an old garment; for the piece that filleth in teareth away from the garment, and a worse rent is made.
040	MAT	009	017	Nor do men put new wine into old skins; else the skins burst, and the wine runneth out, and the skins are spoilt. But they put new wine into new skins, and both are preserved together.
040	MAT	009	018	While he was thus speaking to them, lo! a certain ruler came in and bowed down before him, saying, My daughter just now died; but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she will live.
040	MAT	009	019	And Jesus arose and followed him, with his disciples.
040	MAT	009	020	And, lo! a woman, who had had an issue of blood for twelve years, came up behind, and touched the fringe of his garment.
040	MAT	009	021	For she said within herself, If I only touch his garment, I shall be made well.
040	MAT	009	022	And he turned round, and seeing her, said, Be of good cheer, daughter; thy faith hath made thee well. And the woman was made well from that hour.
040	MAT	009	023	And Jesus coming into the ruler's house, and seeing the minstrels, and the crowd making a noise,
040	MAT	009	024	said, Withdraw; for the girl is not dead, but is sleeping. And they laughed him to scorn.
040	MAT	009	025	But when the crowd had been put out, he went in, and took hold of her hand; and the girl arose.
040	MAT	009	026	And the report of this went abroad into all that country.
040	MAT	009	027	And as Jesus passed on from thence, two blind men followed him, crying out and saying, Have pity on us, Son of David!
040	MAT	009	028	And when he had come into the house, the blind men came to him; and Jesus saith to them, Do ye believe that I am able to do this? They say to him, Yea, Lord.
040	MAT	009	029	Then he touched their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it done to you.
040	MAT	009	030	And their eyes were opened. And Jesus sternly charged them, saying, See that no one know it.
040	MAT	009	031	But they went out, and spread abroad his fame in all that country.
040	MAT	009	032	And as they were going out, lo! they brought to him a dumb man, possessed by a demon.
040	MAT	009	033	And when the demon was cash out, the dumb man spoke. And the multitudes marveled, saying, Never was the like seen in Israel.
040	MAT	009	034	But the Pharisees said, He casteth out the demons through the prince of the demons.
040	MAT	009	035	And Jesus went round all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the glad tidings of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease.
040	MAT	009	036	And seeing the multitudes, he was moved with compassion for them, because they were harassed and scattered about, as sheep having no shepherd.
040	MAT	009	037	Then he saith to his disciples, The harvest indeed is great, but the laborers are few.
040	MAT	009	038	Pray therefore the Lord of the harvest to send forth laborers for his harvest.
040	MAT	010	001	And he called to him his twelve disciples, and gave them power over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every sickness and every disease.
040	MAT	010	002	Now the names of the twelve apostles are these: first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, and James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother;
040	MAT	010	003	Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the publican; James the son of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus;
040	MAT	010	004	Simon of Cana, and Judas Iscariot, he who betrayed him.
040	MAT	010	005	These twelve Jesus sent forth, when he had charged them, saying, Go not away to gentiles, and enter not any city of the Samaritans;
040	MAT	010	006	but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
040	MAT	010	007	And, as ye go, proclaim, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand.
040	MAT	010	008	Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse lepers, cast out demons; freely ye received, freely give.
040	MAT	010	009	Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass, in your girdles;
040	MAT	010	010	nor bag for the journey, nor two coats, nor sandals, nor a staff. For the laborer is worthy of his living.
040	MAT	010	011	And into whatever city or town ye enter, inquire who in it is worthy; and there abide till ye leave the place.
040	MAT	010	012	And as ye enter the house, salute it.
040	MAT	010	013	And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it; but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you.
040	MAT	010	014	And whoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye go out of that house or city, shake off the dust from your feet.
040	MAT	010	015	Truly do I say to you, It will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment, than for that city.
040	MAT	010	016	Lo! I send you forth as sheep into the midst of wolves. Be therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.
040	MAT	010	017	But beware of men. For they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues;
040	MAT	010	018	and ye will be brought before governors and kings for my sake, that ye may bear testimony to them and to the gentiles.
040	MAT	010	019	But when they deliver you up, be not anxious as to how or What ye shall speak; for it will be given you in that hour what ye shall speak.
040	MAT	010	020	For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father that speaketh in you.
040	MAT	010	021	And brother will deliver up brother to death, and the father his child; and children will rise up against their parent, and put them to death;
040	MAT	010	022	and ye will be hated by all on account of my name. But he that endureth to the end will be saved.
040	MAT	010	023	And when they persecute you in one city, flee to another. For truly do I say to you, Ye will not have gone over the cities of Israel till the Son of man hath come.
040	MAT	010	024	A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his lord.
040	MAT	010	025	It is enough for the disciple to be as his teacher, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebul, how much more will they so call those of his household!
040	MAT	010	026	Fear them not therefore. For there is nothing covered that will not be revealed; and hid, that will not be known.
040	MAT	010	027	What I say to you in darkness, speak ye in the light; and what ye hear in the ear, proclaim ye upon the housetops.
040	MAT	010	028	And fear not those who kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul; but rather fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.
040	MAT	010	029	Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? and not one of them shall fall to the ground without your Father.
040	MAT	010	030	But even the hairs of your head are all numbered.
040	MAT	010	031	Fear not therefore; ye are of more value than many sparrows.
040	MAT	010	032	Every one therefore who shall acknowledge me before men, him will I also acknowledge before my Father who is in heaven.
040	MAT	010	033	But whoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father who is in heaven.
040	MAT	010	034	Think not that I came to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.
040	MAT	010	035	For I came to set a man at variance with his father, and a daughter with her mother, and a bride with her mother-in-law;
040	MAT	010	036	and they of a man's own household will be his foes.
040	MAT	010	037	He that loveth father or mother more than me, is not worthy of me; and he that loveth son or daughter more than me, is not worthy of me;
040	MAT	010	038	and he that doth not take his cross, and follow me, is not worthy of me.
040	MAT	010	039	He that findeth his life will lose it; and he that loseth his life for my sake will find it.
040	MAT	010	040	He that receiveth you, receiveth me; and he that receiveth me, receiveth him that sent me.
040	MAT	010	041	He that receiveth a prophet because he is a prophet, will receive a prophet's reward, and he that receiveth a righteous man because he is a righteous man, will receive a righteous man's reward.
040	MAT	010	042	And whoever shall give to drink only a cup of cold water to one of these little ones because he is a disciple, truly do I say to you, he will by no means lose his reward.
040	MAT	011	001	And it came to pass, when Jesus had made an end of his charge to his twelve disciples, that he departed thence, to teach and to preach in their cities.
040	MAT	011	002	And John, having heard in the prison of the works of Christ, sent by his disciples,
040	MAT	011	003	and said to him, Art thou he that is to come, or are we to look for another?
040	MAT	011	004	And Jesus answered and said to them, Go and tell John what ye hear and see.
040	MAT	011	005	The blind receive sight and the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised, and to the poor good tidings are brought;
040	MAT	011	006	and blessed is he, whoever shall find no occasion of stumbling in me.
040	MAT	011	007	And, as these were going, Jesus began to say to the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see? the reeds shaken by the wind?
040	MAT	011	008	But why did ye go out? to see a man clothed in soft raiment? Lo! they that wear soft clothing are in kings' houses.
040	MAT	011	009	But why did ye go out? to see a prophet? Yea, I say to you, and more than a prophet.
040	MAT	011	010	For this is he of whom it is written: “Lo! I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee.”
040	MAT	011	011	Truly do I say to you, Among those born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist. But he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
040	MAT	011	012	And from the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent seize upon it.
040	MAT	011	013	For all the Prophets and the Law, until John, prophesied.
040	MAT	011	014	And if ye are willing to receive it, he is the Elijah who was to come.
040	MAT	011	015	He that hath ears, let him hear.
040	MAT	011	016	But to what shall I liken this generation? It is like children sitting in the markets, who call to their fellows,
040	MAT	011	017	and say, We piped to you, and ye did not dance; we sung a dirge, and ye did not lament.
040	MAT	011	018	For John came neither eating nor drinking; and they say, He hath a demon.
040	MAT	011	019	The Son of man came eating and drinking; and they say, Behold, a glutton and a wine-bibber, a friend of publicans and sinners! But wisdom is justified by her works.
040	MAT	011	020	Then he began to upbraid the cities wherein most of his miracles were done, because they did not repent.
040	MAT	011	021	Woe to thee, Chorazin! woe to thee, Bethsaida! for if the miracles that were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
040	MAT	011	022	But I say to you, It will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment, than for you.
040	MAT	011	023	And thou, Capernaum! shalt thou be exalted to heaven? Thou shalt be brought down to the underworld; for if the miracles which were done in thee had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.
040	MAT	011	024	But I say to you, that it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee.
040	MAT	011	025	At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that, though thou didst hide these things from the wise and discerning, thou didst reveal them to babes.
040	MAT	011	026	Yea, Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight.
040	MAT	011	027	All things were delivered to me by my Father; and no one knoweth the Son but the Father; nor doth any one know the Father, but the Son, and he to whom it is the will of the Son to reveal him.
040	MAT	011	028	Come to me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
040	MAT	011	029	Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me; for I am meek and lowly in heart; and ye shall find rest for your souls.
040	MAT	011	030	For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.
040	MAT	012	001	At that time Jesus went on the sabbath through the grain-fields; and his disciples were hungry, and began to pluck the ears of grain, and to eat.
040	MAT	012	002	But the Pharisees, seeing it, said to him, Lo! thy disciples are doing that which it is not lawful to do on the sabbath.
040	MAT	012	003	But he said to them, Have ye not read what David did, when he and those who were with him were hungry?
040	MAT	012	004	how he went into the house of God, and they ate the show-bread, which it was not lawful for him to eat, nor for those who were with him, but for the priests alone?
040	MAT	012	005	Or have ye not read in the Law, that on the sabbaths the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless?
040	MAT	012	006	But I say to you, that something greater than the temple is here.
040	MAT	012	007	But if ye had known what this meaneth, “I desire mercy and not sacrifice,” ye would not have condemned the guiltless.
040	MAT	012	008	For the Son of man is lord of the sabbath.
040	MAT	012	009	And departing thence, he went into their synagogue.
040	MAT	012	010	And, lo! there was a man having a withered hand. And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath? that they might accuse him.
040	MAT	012	011	And he said to them, Who of you that owneth one sheep, if it fall into a pit on the sabbath, will not lay hold of it, and lift it out?
040	MAT	012	012	Of how much more worth now is a man than a sheep! So then it is lawful to do well on the sabbath.
040	MAT	012	013	Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he stretched it forth; and it was restored sound as the other.
040	MAT	012	014	Then the Pharisees went out, and consulted together against him, how they might destroy him.
040	MAT	012	015	But Jesus, knowing it, withdrew from thence; and many followed him; and he healed them all,
040	MAT	012	016	and strictly charged them not to make him known;
040	MAT	012	017	that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,
040	MAT	012	018	“Behold my servant, whom I chose; my beloved, with whom my soul is well pleased; I will put my Spirit upon him, and he will declare judgment to the nations.
040	MAT	012	019	He will not strive, nor cry aloud, nor will any one hear his voice in the streets.
040	MAT	012	020	A bruised reed he will not break, and smoking flax he will not quench, till he send forth judgment unto victory.
040	MAT	012	021	And in his name will nations hope.”
040	MAT	012	022	Then was brought to him one possessed by a demon, blind and dumb; and he healed him, so that the dumb man spoke and saw.
040	MAT	012	023	And all the multitudes were amazed, and said, Is this the son of David?
040	MAT	012	024	But the Pharisees, hearing it, said, This man doth not cast out the demons, except through Beelzebul, the prince of the demons.
040	MAT	012	025	And he, knowing their thoughts, said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and no city or house divided against itself will stand.
040	MAT	012	026	And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself; how then shall his kingdom stand?
040	MAT	012	027	And if I cast out the demons through Beelzebul, through whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore shall they be judges of you.
040	MAT	012	028	But if I cast out the demons through the Spirit of God, then hath the kingdom of God already come to you.
040	MAT	012	029	Or how can one enter into a strong man's house, and seize upon his goods, unless he first bind the strong man, and then plunder his house?
040	MAT	012	030	He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.
040	MAT	012	031	Therefore I say to you, All manner of sin and evil-speaking will be forgiven to men; but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.
040	MAT	012	032	And whoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it will be forgiven him; but whoever speaketh against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him, either in this world, or in the world to come.
040	MAT	012	033	Either say that the tree is good, and its fruit good; or say that the tree is bad, and its fruit bad; for the tree is known by its fruit. Brood of vipers!
040	MAT	012	034	How can ye, evil as ye are, speak good things? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.
040	MAT	012	035	The good man, from his good treasure, bringeth out good things; and the evil man, from his evil treasure, bringeth out evil things.
040	MAT	012	036	And I say to you, that for every idle word that men shall speak, they will give account in the day of judgment.
040	MAT	012	037	For by thy words thou wilt be justified, and by thy words thou wilt be condemned.
040	MAT	012	038	Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered him, saying, Teacher, we wish to see a sign from thee.
040	MAT	012	039	But he answered and said to them, A wicked and adulterous generation is seeking for a sign; and no sign will be given to it, but the sign of Jonah the prophet.
040	MAT	012	040	For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so will the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
040	MAT	012	041	The men of Nineveh will stand up in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and, lo! something more than Jonah is here.
040	MAT	012	042	The queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn it; for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and lo! something more than Solomon is here.
040	MAT	012	043	But when the unclean spirit is gone out from a man, it goeth through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth it not.
040	MAT	012	044	Then it saith, I will return to my house whence I came out. And on coming, it findeth it empty, and swept, and put in order.
040	MAT	012	045	Then it goeth and taketh with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they enter in, and dwell there; and the last state of that man becometh worse than the first. So will it be also with this wicked generation.
040	MAT	012	046	While he was yet speaking to the multitudes, lo! his mother and his brothers were standing without, seeking to speak with him.
040	MAT	012	047	And one said to him, Behold, thy mother and thy brothers are standing without, seeking to speak with thee.
040	MAT	012	048	But he answered and said to him that told him, Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?
040	MAT	012	049	And stretching forth his hand toward his disciples, be said, Behold, my mother and my brothers!
040	MAT	012	050	For whoever doeth the will of my Father who is in heaven, he is my brother, and sister, and mother.
040	MAT	013	001	The same day Jesus went out of the house, and sat by the shore of the lake;
040	MAT	013	002	and great multitudes were gathered together to him, so that he went into a boat, and sat down; and all the multitude stood on the beach.
040	MAT	013	003	And he spoke many things to them in parables, saying, Behold, a sower went forth to sow.
040	MAT	013	004	And as he sowed, some seeds fell by the wayside; and the birds came and devoured them.
040	MAT	013	005	And others fell upon rocky places, where they had not much earth; and they sprung up immediately, because they had no depth of earth.
040	MAT	013	006	But when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.
040	MAT	013	007	And others fell among thorns; and the thorns grew up, and choked them.
040	MAT	013	008	And others fell upon good ground; and yielded fruit, some a hundred fold, some Sixty, some thirty fold.
040	MAT	013	009	He that hath ears, let him hear.
040	MAT	013	010	And the disciples came and said to him, Why dost thou speak to them in parables?
040	MAT	013	011	He answered and said, Because to you it hath been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven; but to them it hath not been given.
040	MAT	013	012	For whoever hath, to him will be given, and he will have abundance; but whoever hath not, from him will be taken away even what he hath.
040	MAT	013	013	Therefore I speak to them in parables, because seeing they see not, and hearing they hear not, nor understand.
040	MAT	013	014	And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah, which saith, “Ye will hear indeed, and not understand; and ye will see indeed, and not perceive.
040	MAT	013	015	For this people's heart hath become gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed, lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and turn from their ways, and I should heal them.”
040	MAT	013	016	But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear.
040	MAT	013	017	Truly do I say to you, that many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things which ye see, and did not see them; and to hear the things which ye hear, and did not hear them.
040	MAT	013	018	Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower.
040	MAT	013	019	When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, the Evil One cometh, and snatcheth away that which was sown in his heart; this man is what was sown by the wayside.
040	MAT	013	020	And what was sown on the rocky places, this is he that heareth the word, and immediately receiveth it with joy,
040	MAT	013	021	but, having no root within him, endureth only for a time; and when tribulation or persecution ariseth on account of the word, he immediately falleth away.
040	MAT	013	022	And what was sown among the thorns, this is he that heareth the word, but the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.
040	MAT	013	023	And what was sown on the good ground, this is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; who also beareth fruit, and yieldeth, one a hundred fold, another sixty, another thirty fold.
040	MAT	013	024	Another parable he put forth to them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.
040	MAT	013	025	But while men slept, his enemy came, and sowed tares among the wheat; and went away.
040	MAT	013	026	But when the blade grew up, and put forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.
040	MAT	013	027	So the servants of the householder came and said to him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? Whence then hath it tares?
040	MAT	013	028	He said to them, An enemy did this. The servants say to him, Dost thou wish then that we go and gather them up?
040	MAT	013	029	But he said, Nay; lest, while ye gather up the tares, ye root up the wheat with them.
040	MAT	013	030	Let both grow together until the harvest; and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather up first the tares, and bind them in bundles, to burn them; but gather the wheat into my barn.
040	MAT	013	031	Another parable he put forth to them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard, which a man took and sowed in his field.
040	MAT	013	032	Which is the least indeed of all seeds; but when it is grown, it is greater than the herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in its branches.
040	MAT	013	033	Another parable he spoke to them: The kingdom of heaven is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.
040	MAT	013	034	All these things Jesus spoke to the multitudes in parables, and without a parable he spoke nothing to them;
040	MAT	013	035	that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet Isaiah, saying, “I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things hidden from the foundation [[of the world]].”
040	MAT	013	036	Then he sent the multitudes away, and went into the house. And his disciples came to him, saying, Explain to us the parable of the tares of the field.
040	MAT	013	037	He answered and said, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man.
040	MAT	013	038	The field is the world; the good seed is the sons of the kingdom; but the tares are the sons of the Evil One;
040	MAT	013	039	the enemy that sowed them is the Devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are angels.
040	MAT	013	040	As therefore the tares are gathered up and burned with fire, so will it be at the end of the world.
040	MAT	013	041	The Son of man will send forth his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all the stumbling-blocks, and those who do iniquity,
040	MAT	013	042	and will cast them into the furnace of fire; there will be wailing and gnashing of teeth.
040	MAT	013	043	Then will the righteous shine forth as the sun, in the kingdom of their Father. He that hath ears, let him hear.
040	MAT	013	044	The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hid in a field, which a man found and hid; and for joy thereof he goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.
040	MAT	013	045	Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant seeking goodly pearls.
040	MAT	013	046	And having found one pearl of great price, he went and sold all that he had, and bought it.
040	MAT	013	047	Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net, cast into the sea, and bringing together fish of every kind;
040	MAT	013	048	which, when it was full, they drew upon the beach, and sat down and gathered the good into vessels, but threw the bad away.
040	MAT	013	049	So will it be at the end of the world. The angels will come forth, and separate the wicked from among the righteous,
040	MAT	013	050	and will cast them into the furnace of fire; there will be wailing and gnashing of teeth.
040	MAT	013	051	Did ye understand all these things? They say to him, Yea.
040	MAT	013	052	And he said to them, Thus then every scribe, instructed for the kingdom of heaven, is like a householder, who bringeth out from his storehouse things new and old.
040	MAT	013	053	And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these parables, that he departed thence.
040	MAT	013	054	And having come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this man this wisdom, and the miracles?
040	MAT	013	055	Is not this the carpenter's son? Is not his mother called Mary, and his brothers, James, and Joseph, and Simon, and Judas?
040	MAT	013	056	And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this man all these things?
040	MAT	013	057	And they took offence at him. But Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country, and in his own house.
040	MAT	013	058	And he did not work many miracles there, because of their unbelief.
040	MAT	014	001	At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus,
040	MAT	014	002	and said to his servants, This is John the Baptist; he hath risen from the dead, and therefore do these powers work in him.
040	MAT	014	003	For Herod had seized John, and bound him, and put him in prison, on account of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife.
040	MAT	014	004	For John said to him, It is not lawful for thee to have her.
040	MAT	014	005	And wishing to put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they regarded him as a prophet.
040	MAT	014	006	But when Herod's birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias danced before them, and pleased Herod;
040	MAT	014	007	whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatever she might ask.
040	MAT	014	008	And she, being set on by her mother, saith, Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist.
040	MAT	014	009	And the king was sorry; but on account of his oaths, and of those at table with him, he ordered it to be given,
040	MAT	014	010	and sent and beheaded John in the prison.
040	MAT	014	011	And his head was brought on a platter, and given to the damsel; and she brought it to her mother.
040	MAT	014	012	And his disciples came and took up the body, and buried it, and went and told Jesus.
040	MAT	014	013	When Jesus heard of it, he withdrew thence in a boat into a desert place apart; and the multitudes hearing of it followed him on foot from the cities.
040	MAT	014	014	And when he came forth he saw a great multitude; and he was moved with compassion for them, and healed their sick.
040	MAT	014	015	And when it was evening, the disciples came to him, saying, This is a desert place, and it is now late; send the multitudes away therefore, that they may go to the villages and buy themselves victuals.
040	MAT	014	016	But he said to them, They need not go away; do ye give them food.
040	MAT	014	017	And they say to him, We have here only five loaves, and two fishes.
040	MAT	014	018	He said, Bring them hither to me.
040	MAT	014	019	And bidding the multitudes to lie down on the grass, he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and, looking up to heaven, he blessed; and having broken the loaves he gave them to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes.
040	MAT	014	020	And they all ate, and were filled. And they took up of the fragments that remained, twelve baskets full.
040	MAT	014	021	And they who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children.
040	MAT	014	022	and he constrained the disciples to get into the boat, and to go before him to the other side, while he sent the multitudes away.
040	MAT	014	023	And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into the mountain apart to pray. And when evening came, he was there alone.
040	MAT	014	024	But the boat was now in the midst of the lake, tossed by the waves; for the wind was contrary.
040	MAT	014	025	And in the fourth watch of the night, he went to them, walking on the lake.
040	MAT	014	026	And seeing him walking on the lake, they were dismayed, saying, It is a spectre; and they cried out for fear.
040	MAT	014	027	But he immediately spoke to them, saying, Be of good cheer, it is I; be not afraid.
040	MAT	014	028	And Peter answering him said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come to thee on the water.
040	MAT	014	029	And he said, Come. And Peter, coming down from the boat, walked on the water, and came to Jesus.
040	MAT	014	030	But seeing the wind, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried out, saying, Lord, save me!
040	MAT	014	031	And Jesus immediately stretched out his hand, and took hold of him, and said to him, Thou of little faith, why didst thou doubt?
040	MAT	014	032	And when they had got into the boat, the wind ceased.
040	MAT	014	033	And they that were in the boat fell down before him, saying, Truly thou art the Son of God.
040	MAT	014	034	And crossing over, they came to land, to Gennesaret.
040	MAT	014	035	And the men of that place, when they saw who he was, sent out into all that country round, and brought to him all the diseased,
040	MAT	014	036	and besought him that they might only touch the fringe of his garment; and as many as touched were made well.
040	MAT	015	001	Then come to Jesus Pharisees and scribes from Jerusalem, saying,
040	MAT	015	002	Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.
040	MAT	015	003	But he answered and said to them, Why do ye too transgress the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition?
040	MAT	015	004	For God commanded, saying, “Honor thy father and thy mother;” and, “He that curseth father or mother, let him surely die.”
040	MAT	015	005	But ye say, Whoever shall say to his father or his mother, Whatever thou mightst receive in aid from me is a gift [[to God]],
040	MAT	015	006	he shall not honor his father or his mother. Thus have ye made void the law of God for the sake of your tradition.
040	MAT	015	007	Hypocrites! well did Isaiah prophesy concerning you, saying,
040	MAT	015	008	“This people honoreth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.
040	MAT	015	009	But in vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.”
040	MAT	015	010	And calling the multitude, he said to them, Hear, and understand.
040	MAT	015	011	Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.
040	MAT	015	012	Then come the disciples, and say to him, Dost thou know that the Pharisees were offended, when they heard that saying?
040	MAT	015	013	But he answered and said, Every plant which my heavenly Father did not plant will be rooted up.
040	MAT	015	014	Let them alone; they are blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both will fall into a ditch.
040	MAT	015	015	And Peter answering said to him, Explain to us that dark saying.
040	MAT	015	016	And he said, Are ye too still without discernment?
040	MAT	015	017	Do ye not understand, that whatever entereth the mouth goeth into the stomach, and is cast out into the drain?
040	MAT	015	018	But the things which proceed from the mouth come out of the heart; and these defile a man.
040	MAT	015	019	For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false testimony, blasphemies.
040	MAT	015	020	These are the things which defile a man; but to eat with unwashed hands defileth not a man.
040	MAT	015	021	And Jesus, going from thence, withdrew to the parts of Tyre and Sidon.
040	MAT	015	022	And, lo! a woman of Canaan came out from those borders, and cried out, saying, Have compassion on me, Lord, Son of David! My daughter is grievously afflicted with a demon.
040	MAT	015	023	But he did not answer her a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying Send her away, for she is crying out after us.
040	MAT	015	024	But he answered and said, I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
040	MAT	015	025	Then she came and fell down before him, saying, Lord, help me!
040	MAT	015	026	But he answering said, It is not allowable to take the children's bread, and throw it to the little dogs.
040	MAT	015	027	And she said, Yea, Lord; for the little dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from the table of their masters.
040	MAT	015	028	Then Jesus answering said to her, O woman, great is thy faith; be it done to thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was cured from that hour.
040	MAT	015	029	And departing thence, Jesus came near the lake of Galilee; and going up the mountain, he sat down there.
040	MAT	015	030	And great multitudes came to him, having with them those who were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others; and they laid them down at his feet, and he healed them;
040	MAT	015	031	so that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb speaking, the maimed sound, and the lame walking, and the blind seeing; and they gave glory to the God of Israel.
040	MAT	015	032	And Jesus having called his disciples to him, said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they have remained with me now three days, and have nothing to eat; and I am not willing to send them away fasting, lest they faint on the road.
040	MAT	015	033	And the disciples say to him, Whence should we have so many loaves in a wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude?
040	MAT	015	034	And Jesus saith to them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few small fishes.
040	MAT	015	035	And bidding the multitude to lie down on the ground,
040	MAT	015	036	he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and broke, and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes.
040	MAT	015	037	And they all ate, and were filled; and they took up of the fragments that remained, seven baskets full.
040	MAT	015	038	And they who ate were four thousand men, besides children and women.
040	MAT	015	039	Then he sent away the multitudes, and went on board the boat, and came into the borders of Magadan.
040	MAT	016	001	And the Pharisees and Sadducees came to try him, and asked him to show them a sign from heaven.
040	MAT	016	002	And he answering said to them, When it is evening, ye say, Fair weather! for the sky is red.
040	MAT	016	003	And in the morning, A storm today! for the sky is red and lowering. Ye know how to judge of the face of the sky, and can ye not discern the signs of the times?
040	MAT	016	004	A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and no sign will be given to it, but the sign of Jonah. And he left them and went away.
040	MAT	016	005	And the disciples having come to the other side, had forgotten to take bread.
040	MAT	016	006	And Jesus said to them, Take heed, and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
040	MAT	016	007	And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we took no bread.
040	MAT	016	008	And Jesus knowing it, said, Why are ye reasoning among yourselves, ye of little faith, because ye took no bread?
040	MAT	016	009	Do ye not yet understand, nor remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?
040	MAT	016	010	Nor the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?
040	MAT	016	011	How is it that ye do not understand, that I spoke not to you of loaves? But [[I said]] Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
040	MAT	016	012	Then they understood, that he did not bid them beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
040	MAT	016	013	And Jesus, having come into the region of Caesarea Philippi, asked his disciples, saying, Who do men say that the Son of man is?
040	MAT	016	014	And they said, Some, John the Baptist; but some, Elijah; and others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.
040	MAT	016	015	He saith to them, But who do ye say that I am?
040	MAT	016	016	And Simon Peter answering said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.
040	MAT	016	017	And Jesus answering said to him, Blessed art thou, Simon, son of Jonah; for flesh and blood did not reveal it to thee, but my Father who is in heaven.
040	MAT	016	018	And I on my part say to thee, that thou art Peter, a rock, and on this rock will I build my church, and the gates of the underworld shall not prevail against it.
040	MAT	016	019	I will give thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatever thou shalt bind on earth will be bound in heaven; and whatever thou shalt loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
040	MAT	016	020	Then he charged the disciples to tell no one that he was the Christ.
040	MAT	016	021	From that time Jesus began to show to his disciples, that he must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be put to death, and rise again on the third day.
040	MAT	016	022	Then Peter, taking him aside, began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from thee, Lord! This shall not be to thee.
040	MAT	016	023	But he turned and said to Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan! thou art my stumbling-block; for thy thoughts are not on the things of God, but on those of men.
040	MAT	016	024	Then Jesus said to his disciples, If any one chooseth to come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.
040	MAT	016	025	For whoever chooseth to save his life will lose it; and whoever shall lose his life for my sake will find it.
040	MAT	016	026	For what will a man be profited, if be gain the whole world, and forfeit his life? or what shall a man give as an exchange for his life?
040	MAT	016	027	For the Son of man is to come in the glory of his Father, with his angels; and then will he render to every one according to his works.
040	MAT	016	028	Truly do I say to you, There are some of those standing here who will not taste of death, till they have seen the Son of man coming in his kingdom.
040	MAT	017	001	And after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter, and James, and John his brother, and leadeth them up into a high mountain apart.
040	MAT	017	002	And he was transfigured before them, and his face shone as the sun; and his garments became white as the light.
040	MAT	017	003	And lo! there appeared to them Moses and Elijah, talking with him.
040	MAT	017	004	And Peter answering said to Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here; if thou wilt, I will make here three tents; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.
040	MAT	017	005	While he was yet speaking, lo! a bright cloud overshadowed them; and lo! a voice out of the cloud, saying, “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased; hear him.”
040	MAT	017	006	And the disciples hearing it, fell on their face, and were exceedingly afraid.
040	MAT	017	007	And Jesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not afraid.
040	MAT	017	008	And lifting up their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus only.
040	MAT	017	009	And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, Tell what hath been seen to no one, until the Son of man hath risen from the dead.
040	MAT	017	010	And the disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes that Elijah must first come?
040	MAT	017	011	And he answering said, Elijah indeed cometh, and will restore all things.
040	MAT	017	012	But I say to you, that Elijah hath already come, and they knew him not, but did with him whatever they would. So also is the Son of man to suffer by them.
040	MAT	017	013	Then the disciples understood that he spoke to them of John the Baptist.
040	MAT	017	014	And when they had come to the multitude, there came to him a man, kneeling down to him, and saying,
040	MAT	017	015	Lord, have compassion on my son; for he is a lunatic, and is sorely afflicted; for he often falleth into the fire, and often into the water.
040	MAT	017	016	And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him.
040	MAT	017	017	Then Jesus answering said, Unbelieving and perverse generation! How long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him hither to me.
040	MAT	017	018	And Jesus rebuked him, and the demon went out of him; and the boy was cured from that hour.
040	MAT	017	019	Then the disciples came to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast it out?
040	MAT	017	020	And he said to them, Because of your want of faith. For truly do I say to you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard, ye shall say to this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place, and it will remove; and nothing will be impossible to you.
040	MAT	017	022	And while they were together in Galilee, Jesus said to them, The Son of man is about to be delivered up into the hands of men,
040	MAT	017	023	and they will put him to death; and on the third day he will rise again. And they were greatly grieved.
040	MAT	017	024	And when they had come to Capernaum, those who received the half-shekel came to Peter, and said, Doth not your teacher pay the half-shekel?
040	MAT	017	025	He saith, Yes. And when he had come into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? Of whom do the kings of the earth take customs or taxes? Of their own sons, or of strangers?
040	MAT	017	026	And when he said, Of strangers, Jesus said to him, Then are the sons free.
040	MAT	017	027	But that we may not give them offence, go to the lake, and cast a hook, and take the fish that first cometh up; and on opening his mouth, thou wilt find a shekel; take that, and give it to them for me and thee.
040	MAT	018	001	At that time the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Who then is greatest in the kingdom of heaven?
040	MAT	018	002	And he called a child to him, and set him in the midst of them,
040	MAT	018	003	and said, Truly do I say to you, Unless ye are changed, and become as children, ye will not enter the kingdom of heaven.
040	MAT	018	004	Whoever therefore shall humble himself as this child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
040	MAT	018	005	And whoever receiveth one such child in my name, receiveth me.
040	MAT	018	006	But whoever shall cause one of these little ones that believe in me to fall away, it were better for him to have a great millstone hung round his neck, and be swallowed up in the depth of the sea.
040	MAT	018	007	Woe to the world because of stumbling-blocks! For it must needs be that stumbling-blocks come; but woe to the man through whom the stumbling-block cometh!
040	MAT	018	008	And if thy hand or thy foot is causing thee to fall, cut it off, and cast it from thee; it is better for thee to enter into life maimed or lame, than having two hands, or two feet, to be cast into the everlasting fire.
040	MAT	018	009	And if thine eye is causing thee to fall, pluck it out, and cast it from thee; it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell-fire.
040	MAT	018	010	Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say to you, that their angels in heaven continually behold the face of my Father who is in heaven.
040	MAT	018	012	What think ye? if a man have a hundred sheep, and one of them hath gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety-nine upon the mountains, and go and seek that which hath gone astray?
040	MAT	018	013	And if it happen that he find it, truly do I say to you, he rejoiceth over it more than over the ninety-nine that did not go astray.
040	MAT	018	014	Thus it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish.
040	MAT	018	015	Moreover, if thy brother sin, go and reprove him between thee and him alone. If he listen to thee, thou hast gained thy brother;
040	MAT	018	016	but if he do not listen, take with thee one or two more; that by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.
040	MAT	018	017	And if he disregard them, tell the matter to the church; but if he disregard the church also, let him be to thee as a heathen and a publican.
040	MAT	018	018	Truly do I say to you, Whatever ye shall bind on earth will be bound in heaven; and whatever ye shall loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
040	MAT	018	019	Again, I say to you, that if two of you shall agree on earth concerning any thing that they shall ask, it will be done for them by my Father o who is in heaven.
040	MAT	018	020	For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.
040	MAT	018	021	Then came Peter, and said to him, Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Until seven times?
040	MAT	018	022	Jesus saith to him, I say not to thee, until seven times, but until seventy times seven.
040	MAT	018	023	Therefore the kingdom of heaven is likened to a king, who would settle accounts with his servants.
040	MAT	018	024	And when he had begun to reckon, there was brought to him one, who owed him ten thousand talents.
040	MAT	018	025	But as he was unable to pay, his lord ordered him to be sold, and his wife and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.
040	MAT	018	026	Then that servant fell down and did obeisance to him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.
040	MAT	018	027	And the lord of that servant, being moved with compassion, released him, and forgave him the debt.
040	MAT	018	028	But that servant went out, and found one of his fellow-servants, who owed him a hundred denaries; and he laid hold of him, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay what thou owest.
040	MAT	018	029	His fellow-servant then fell down and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee.
040	MAT	018	030	And he would not; but went away and cast him into prison, till he should pay the debt.
040	MAT	018	031	Then his fellow-servants, seeing what was done, were greatly grieved; and went and told their lord all that had been done.
040	MAT	018	032	Then his lord, having called him, saith to him, Thou wicked servant! All that debt I forgave thee because thou didst beseech me;
040	MAT	018	033	shouldst not thou also have had pity on thy fellow-servant, even as I had pity on thee?
040	MAT	018	034	And his lord was enraged, and delivered him to the inflicters of punishment, till he should pay all that was due to him.
040	MAT	018	035	So also will my heavenly Father do to you, if ye forgive not every one his brother from your hearts.
040	MAT	019	001	And it came to pass, that when Jesus had ended these sayings, he removed from Galilee, and came into the borders of Judaea, beyond the Jordan.
040	MAT	019	002	And great multitudes followed him; and he healed them there.
040	MAT	019	003	And the Pharisees came to him, trying him, and saying, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?
040	MAT	019	004	And he answering said, Have ye not read, that he who made them at the beginning, made them male and female?
040	MAT	019	005	And He said: “For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and cleave to his wife; and the two shall become one flesh.”
040	MAT	019	006	So they are no longer two, but one flesh. What therefore God joined together, let not man put asunder.
040	MAT	019	007	They say to him, Why then did Moses ordain that a man may give his wife a writing of divorcement, and put her away?
040	MAT	019	008	He saith to them, Moses, on account of your hardness of heart, allowed you m put away your wives; but in the beginning it was not so.
040	MAT	019	009	And I say to you, Whoever putteth away his wife, except for fornication, and marrieth another, committeth adultery.
040	MAT	019	010	The disciples say to him, If such be the case of a man with his wife, it is not good to marry.
040	MAT	019	011	But he said to them, All cannot receive this saying, but they only to whom it is given.
040	MAT	019	012	For there are eunuchs, who were so born from their mother's womb; and there are eunuchs, who were made eunuchs by men; and there are eunuchs, who made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.
040	MAT	019	013	Then there were brought to him children, that be might lay his hands on them, and pray; and the disciples rebuked them.
040	MAT	019	014	But Jesus said to them, Suffer the children, and forbid them not to come to me; for to such belongeth the kingdom of heaven.
040	MAT	019	015	And he laid his hands on them, and departed thence.
040	MAT	019	016	And lo! one came to him and said, Teacher, what good thing shall I do, that I may have everlasting life?
040	MAT	019	017	And he said to him, Why dost thou ask me concerning what is good? There is but one who is good. But if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.
040	MAT	019	018	Which? saith he. And Jesus said, These: “Thou shalt not kill; Thou shalt not commit adultery; Thou shalt not steal; Thou shalt not bear false witness;
040	MAT	019	019	Honor thy father and thy mother;” and, “Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.”
040	MAT	019	020	The young man saith to him, All these things have I kept; in what am I still wanting?
040	MAT	019	021	Jesus said to him, If thou wilt be perfect, go, sell what thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.
040	MAT	019	022	But the young man, on hearing this went away sorrowful; for he had great possessions.
040	MAT	019	023	Then Jesus said to his disciples, Truly do I say to you, it will be hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.
040	MAT	019	024	And again I say to you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.
040	MAT	019	025	And the disciples, hearing this, were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved?
040	MAT	019	026	But Jesus, fixing his eyes on them, said, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.
040	MAT	019	027	Then Peter answering said to him, Lo! we left all, and followed thee; what then shall we have?
040	MAT	019	028	And Jesus said to them, Truly do I say to you, that, in the renovation when the Son of man sitteth on the throne of his glory, ye who have followed me shall also yourselves sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
040	MAT	019	029	And every one who hath left brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or children, or lands, or houses, for the sake of my name, will receive many fold more, and will inherit everlasting life.
040	MAT	019	030	But many who are first will be last, and the last first.
040	MAT	020	001	For the kingdom of heaven is like a householder, who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.
040	MAT	020	002	And having agreed with the laborers for a denary a day, he sent them into his vineyard.
040	MAT	020	003	And going out about the third hour, he saw others standing idle in the market-place;
040	MAT	020	004	and said to them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatever is right, I will give you. And they went.
040	MAT	020	005	Again going out about the sixth and the ninth hour, he did likewise.
040	MAT	020	006	And going out about the eleventh hour, he found others standing, and saith to them, Why stand ye here all the day idle?
040	MAT	020	007	They say to him, Because no one hath hired us. He saith to them, Go ye also into the vineyard.
040	MAT	020	008	And when evening came, the lord of the vineyard saith to his steward, Call the laborers, and give them their pay, beginning with the last, and going on to the first.
040	MAT	020	009	And they who were hired about the eleventh hour came, and received each a denary.
040	MAT	020	010	But when the first came, they supposed that they should receive more; and they too received each a denary.
040	MAT	020	011	And when they had received it, they murmured against the householder,
040	MAT	020	012	saying, These last have worked but one hour, and thou hast made them equal to us, who have borne the burden and heat of the day.
040	MAT	020	013	But he answering said to one of them, Friend, I do thee no wrong; didst not thou agree with me for a denary?
040	MAT	020	014	Take thy due, and go. But I will give to this last even as to thee.
040	MAT	020	015	Am I not free to do what I will with my own? Is thine eye evil, because I am good?
040	MAT	020	016	Thus the last will be first, and the first, last. And as
040	MAT	020	017	Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve apart, and on the way said to them,
040	MAT	020	018	Lo! we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man will be delivered up to the chief priests and scribes; and they will condemn him to death,
040	MAT	020	019	and will deliver him up to the gentiles to mock, and scourge, and crucify; and on the third day he will rise again.
040	MAT	020	020	Then came to him the mother of the sons of Zebedee with her sons, falling down before him, and asking a certain thing of him.
040	MAT	020	021	And he said to her, What is thy wish? She saith to him, Grant that these my two sons may sit, one on thy right hand, and one on thy left, in thy kingdom.
040	MAT	020	022	But Jesus answering said, Ye know not what ye ask. Can ye drink the cup which I am to drink? They say to him, We can.
040	MAT	020	023	He saith to them, Ye will indeed drink my cup; but to sit on my right hand and on my left is not mine to give, but it will be given to those for whom it hath been prepared by my Father.
040	MAT	020	024	And when the ten heard this, they were much displeased with the two brothers.
040	MAT	020	025	But Jesus called them to him, and said, Ye know that the rulers of the nations lord it over them, and their great men exercise a strict authority over them.
040	MAT	020	026	Not so shall it be among you; but whoever desireth to become great among you, will be your minister;
040	MAT	020	027	and whoever desireth to be first among you, will be your servant;
040	MAT	020	028	even as the Son of man came not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life a ransom for many.
040	MAT	020	029	And as they were going out of Jericho, a great multitude followed him.
040	MAT	020	030	And lo! two blind men, who were sitting by the way-side, when they heard that Jesus was passing by, cried out, saying, Have pity on us, Son of David!
040	MAT	020	031	And the multitude sharply bade them be silent. But they cried out the more, saying, Lord, have pity on us, Son of David!
040	MAT	020	032	And Jesus stopped, and called them, and said, What would ye have me do for you?
040	MAT	020	033	They say to him, Lord, to open our eyes.
040	MAT	020	034	Then Jesus, moved with compassion, touched their eyes; and they immediately received sight, and followed him.
040	MAT	021	001	And when they drew near to Jerusalem, and came to Bethphage at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples,
040	MAT	021	002	saying to them, Go m the village over against you, and immediately ye will find an ass tied, and a colt with her; loose and bring them to me.
040	MAT	021	003	And if any one say aught to you, ye shall say, The Lord hath need of them; and he will immediately send them.
040	MAT	021	004	Now this took place, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying,
040	MAT	021	005	“Say to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy king cometh to thee, meek, and riding on an ass, and on a colt the foal of a beast of burden.”
040	MAT	021	006	And the disciples o went, and did as Jesus bade them,
040	MAT	021	007	and brought the ass and the colt, and put on them their garments, and he sat on them.
040	MAT	021	008	And very many of the multitude spread their garments in the road; others cut down branches from the trees, and strewed them in the road.
040	MAT	021	009	And the multitudes that went before him, and that followed, were crying out, saying, Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest heavens!
040	MAT	021	010	And when he came into Jerusalem, the whole city was in commotion, saying, Who is this?
040	MAT	021	011	And the multitudes said, This is the prophet Jesus, from Nazareth of Galilee.
040	MAT	021	012	And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all those who sold and bought in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money-changers, and the seats of those who sold the doves;
040	MAT	021	013	and said to them, It is written, “My house shall be called a house of prayer; but ye make it a den of robbers.”
040	MAT	021	014	And the blind and lame came to him in the temple, and he cured them.
040	MAT	021	015	But the chief priests and the scribes, when they saw the wonderful things which he did, and the children that were crying out in the temple, and saying, Hosanna to the Son of David, were much displeased;
040	MAT	021	016	and said to him, Dost thou hear what these say? But Jesus saith to them, Yea; did ye never read, “From the mouth of babes and sucklings thou didst prepare praise”?
040	MAT	021	017	And he left them, and went out of the city to Bethany, and lodged there.
040	MAT	021	018	And in the morning, as he was returning to the city, he was hungry.
040	MAT	021	019	And seeing one fig-tree by the road-side, he went up to it, and found nothing on it, but leaves only; and he saith to it, Let there be no fruit from thee hencefoward for ever. And immediately the fig-tree withered.
040	MAT	021	020	And the disciples seeing it, marveled, saying, How suddenly did the fig-tree wither!
040	MAT	021	021	Jesus answering said to them, Truly do I say to you, If ye have faith, and do not doubt, not only shall ye do what hath been done to the fig-tree, but should ye even say to this mountain, Be thou taken up and cast into the sea, it would be done.
040	MAT	021	022	And all things whatever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye will receive.
040	MAT	021	023	And when he had come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him as he was teaching, and said, By what authority doest thou these things? And who gave thee this authority?
040	MAT	021	024	And Jesus answering said to them, I also will ask you one question; which if ye answer me, I too will tell you by what authority I do these things.
040	MAT	021	025	The baptism of John, whence was it? From heaven, or from men? And they reasoned among themselves, saying, If we say, From heaven, he will say to us, Why then did ye not believe him?
040	MAT	021	026	But if we say, From men, we fear the multitude; for all regard John as a prophet.
040	MAT	021	027	And they answered Jesus and said, We do not know. And he said to them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.
040	MAT	021	028	But what think ye? A man had two sons: he came to the first, and said, Son, go, work today in the vineyard.
040	MAT	021	029	And he answered and said, I will not. Afterward he repented, and went.
040	MAT	021	030	And he came to the other and said the same. And he answered and said, I will, sir; and went not.
040	MAT	021	031	Which of the two did the will of his father? They say, The first. Jesus saith to them, Truly do I say to you, that the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.
040	MAT	021	032	For John came to you as a preacher of righteousness, and ye did not believe him; but the publicans and the harlots believed him; and ye, when ye had seen it, did not afterward repent, that ye might believe him.
040	MAT	021	033	Hear another parable. There was a householder, who planted a vineyard, and set a hedge about it, and dug in it a wine-press, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went abroad.
040	MAT	021	034	And when the season of the fruits drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, that they might receive his fruits.
040	MAT	021	035	And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.
040	MAT	021	036	Again he sent other servants more than the first; and they dealt with them in the same manner.
040	MAT	021	037	And afterward he sent to them his son, saying, They will respect my son.
040	MAT	021	038	But the husbandmen, when they saw the son, said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and get his inheritance.
040	MAT	021	039	And they took him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him.
040	MAT	021	040	When therefore the lord of the vineyard cometh, what will he do to those husbandmen?
040	MAT	021	041	They say to him, He will bring those wicked men to a miserable end, and will let out his vineyard to other husbandmen, who will render him the fruits in their season.
040	MAT	021	042	Jesus saith to them, Did ye never read in the Scriptures, “The stone which the builders rejected, the same hath become the corner-stone; from the Lord did this come, and it is marvelous in our eyes?”
040	MAT	021	043	Therefore I say to you, that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you, and given to a nation yielding the fruits thereof.
040	MAT	021	045	And the chief priests and the Pharisees when they heard his parables, knew that he was speaking of them.
040	MAT	021	046	And they sought to seize him, but feared the multitudes, because they regarded him as a prophet.
040	MAT	022	001	Jesus answered and spoke to them again in parables, and said,
040	MAT	022	002	The kingdom of heaven is like a certain king, who made a marriage-feast for his son,
040	MAT	022	003	and sent forth his servants to call to the feast those who had been invited; and they would not come.
040	MAT	022	004	Again, he sent other servants, saying, Tell those who have been invited, Behold, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready; come to the feast.
040	MAT	022	005	But they made light of it, and went away; one to his farm, another to his merchandise.
040	MAT	022	006	And the rest seized his servants, and ill-treated and slew them.
040	MAT	022	007	And the king was enraged; and sent forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned their city.
040	MAT	022	008	Then saith he to his servants, The feast is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy.
040	MAT	022	009	Go therefore into the thoroughfares, and as many as ye find, invite to the feast.
040	MAT	022	010	So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all, as many as they found, both bad and good; and the bride-chamber was fully furnished with guests.
040	MAT	022	011	And the king, coming in to view the guests, saw there a man who had not on a wedding garment;
040	MAT	022	012	and he saith to him, Friend, how camest thou in here, not having a wedding garment? And he was struck dumb.
040	MAT	022	013	Then the king said to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and cast him out into the outer darkness; there will be wailing and gnashing of teeth.
040	MAT	022	014	For many are called, but few are chosen.
040	MAT	022	015	Then the Pharisees went and consulted together how l they might ensnare him in speech.
040	MAT	022	016	And they send out to him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Teacher, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, and thou carest for no one; for thou regardest not the person of men.
040	MAT	022	017	Tell us, therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?
040	MAT	022	018	But Jesus, perceiving their wickedness, said, Why are ye trying me, hypocrites?
040	MAT	022	019	Show me the tribute money. And they brought to him a denary.
040	MAT	022	020	And Jesus saith to them, Whose is this image and inscription?
040	MAT	022	021	They say, Caesar's. Then saith he to them, Render then to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.
040	MAT	022	022	And hearing this, they wondered, and left him, and went away.
040	MAT	022	023	The same day there came to him Sadducees, saying that there is no resurrection; and they asked him,
040	MAT	022	024	saying, Teacher, Moses said, “If a man die having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed to his brother.”
040	MAT	022	025	Now there were with us seven brothers; and the first married and died; and, having no offspring, left his wife to his brother.
040	MAT	022	026	And so also the second, and the third, even to the seventh.
040	MAT	022	027	And last of all the woman died.
040	MAT	022	028	In the resurrection, then, of which of the seven will she be the wife? For they all had her.
040	MAT	022	029	Jesus answered and said to them, Ye err, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God.
040	MAT	022	030	For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.
040	MAT	022	031	But concerning the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken to you by God, saying,
040	MAT	022	032	“I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob”? He is not a God of the dead, but of the living.
040	MAT	022	033	And when the multitudes heard this, they were astonished at his teaching.
040	MAT	022	034	And the Pharisees, hearing that he had put the Sadducees to silence, assembled together;
040	MAT	022	035	and one of them, a lawyer, asked, trying him,
040	MAT	022	036	Teacher, which commandment is great in the Law?
040	MAT	022	037	And he said to him, “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.”
040	MAT	022	038	This is the great and first commandment.
040	MAT	022	039	There is a second like it: “Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.”
040	MAT	022	040	On these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets.
040	MAT	022	041	And while the Pharisees were assembled, Jesus asked them,
040	MAT	022	042	saying, What think ye concerning the Christ? whose son is he? They say to him, David's.
040	MAT	022	043	He saith to them, How then doth David in the Spirit call him lord? saying,
040	MAT	022	044	“The Lord said to my lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I put thine enemies under thy feet.”
040	MAT	022	045	If David then calleth him lord, how is he his son?
040	MAT	022	046	And no one was able to answer him a word; nor durst any one from that day question him any more.
040	MAT	023	001	Then Jesus spoke to the multitudes, and to his disciples,
040	MAT	023	002	saying, The scribes and the Pharisees sit in the seat of Moses.
040	MAT	023	003	All, therefore, whatever they bid you, do and observe; but do not according to their works; for they say, and do not.
040	MAT	023	004	They bind heavy burdens, and lay them on men's shoulders, and will not themselves move them with a finger.
040	MAT	023	005	And all their works they do to be observed by men. They make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge their fringes,
040	MAT	023	006	and love the first place at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues,
040	MAT	023	007	and salutations in the markets, and to be called by men, Rabbi.
040	MAT	023	008	But be not ye called Rabbi; for one is your teacher; and ye are all brethren.
040	MAT	023	009	And call no one your father on the earth; for one is your father, he who is in heaven.
040	MAT	023	010	Nor be ye called leaders; for one is your leader, the Christ.
040	MAT	023	011	But the greatest among you will be your servant.
040	MAT	023	012	And whoever shall exalt himself will be humbled; and whoever shall humble himself will be exalted.
040	MAT	023	013	But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites I because ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men; for ye go not in yourselves, nor suffer those who are entering to go in.
040	MAT	023	015	Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte; and when he is made, ye make him two-fold mole a son of hell than yourselves.
040	MAT	023	016	Woe to you, blind guides, that say, Whoever sweareth by the temple, it is nothing; but whoever sweareth by the gold of the temple, is bound.
040	MAT	023	017	Fools and blind I for which is greater, the gold, or the temple that sanctifieth the gold?
040	MAT	023	018	And, Whoever sweareth by the altar, it is nothing; but whoever sweareth by the gift that is upon it, is bound.
040	MAT	023	019	Blind men! For which is greater, the gift, or the altar flint sanctifieth the gift?
040	MAT	023	020	He then who sweareth by the altar, sweareth by it, and by all that is upon it;
040	MAT	023	021	and he that sweareth by the temple, sweareth by it, and by him who dwelleth in it;
040	MAT	023	022	and he who sweareth by heaven, sweareth by the throne of God, and by him who sitteth thereon.
040	MAT	023	023	Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithes of the mint, and the dill, and the cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the Law, justice, and mercy, and faith; these ought ye to have done, and not to leave those undone.
040	MAT	023	024	Blind guides! who strain out a gnat, and swallow a camel.
040	MAT	023	025	Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and the platter, but within they are full of robbery and licentiousness.
040	MAT	023	026	Blind Pharisee! cleanse first the inside of the cup, that its outside side also may become clean.
040	MAT	023	027	Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like whited sepulchres, which outwardly indeed appear beautiful, but within are full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness.
040	MAT	023	028	Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous to men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.
040	MAT	023	029	Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, and adorn the tombs of the righteous,
040	MAT	023	030	and say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.
040	MAT	023	031	So that ye bear witness against yourselves, that ye are the sons of those who killed the prophets.
040	MAT	023	032	Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers!
040	MAT	023	033	Serpents, brood of vipers! how can ye escape the punishment of hell?
040	MAT	023	034	Therefore, behold, I send to you prophets, and wise men, and scribes; some of them ye will kill and crucify, and some of them ye will scourge in your synagogues, and persecute from city to city;
040	MAT	023	035	that on you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah, son of Barachiah, whom ye slew, between the temple and the altar.
040	MAT	023	036	Truly do I say to you, All these things will come upon this generation.
040	MAT	023	037	Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that killeth the prophets, and stoneth those who are sent to her! How often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!
040	MAT	023	038	Lo! your house is left to you desolate.
040	MAT	023	039	For I say to you, Ye will not see me henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.
040	MAT	024	001	And Jesus went out, and was going from the temple; and his disciples came to him, to show him the buildings of the temple.
040	MAT	024	002	And he answering said to them, See ye not all these? Truly do I say to you, There will not be left here one stone upon another, that will not be thrown down.
040	MAT	024	003	And as he was sitting upon the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying, Tell us, when will these things be? and what will be the signs of thy coming, and of the end of the world?
040	MAT	024	004	And Jesus answering said to them, See that no one deceive you.
040	MAT	024	005	For many will come in my name, saying, I am the Christ, and will deceive many.
040	MAT	024	006	And ye are to hear of wars, and rumors of wars; see that ye be not troubled; for these things must come to pass; but not yet is the end.
040	MAT	024	007	For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there will be famines and earthquakes in divers places.
040	MAT	024	008	But all these things are the beginning of travail-pains.
040	MAT	024	009	Then will they deliver you up to distress, and will kill you; and ye will be hated by all nations on account of my name.
040	MAT	024	010	And then will many fall away; and will deliver up one another, and will hate one another.
040	MAT	024	011	And many false prophets will arise, and will deceive many.
040	MAT	024	012	And because iniquity shall abound, the love of the many will wax cold.
040	MAT	024	013	But he that endureth to the end will be saved.
040	MAT	024	014	And these glad tidings of the kingdom will be published throughout the whole world for a testimony to all the nations; and then will come the end.
040	MAT	024	015	When, therefore, ye see the abomination of desolation, spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place, (let him that readeth understand, )
040	MAT	024	016	then let those who are in Judaea flee to the mountains;
040	MAT	024	017	let not him that is on the house-top go down to take away the things belonging to his house;
040	MAT	024	018	and let not him that is in the field turn back to take his garment.
040	MAT	024	019	And woe to the women with child, and to those with children at the breast, in those days!
040	MAT	024	020	And pray that your flight be not in winter, nor on a sabbath.
040	MAT	024	021	For there will then be great distress, such as hath not been from the beginning of the world to this time; no, nor shall ever be.
040	MAT	024	022	And were not those days to shortened, no flesh would be saved; but, for the sake of the chosen, these days will be shortened.
040	MAT	024	023	Then if any one say to you, Lo! here is the Christ; or there, believe him not.
040	MAT	024	024	For there will rise up false Christs, and false prophets, and will show great signs and wonders, so that, if possible, even the chosen will be deceived.
040	MAT	024	025	Lo! I have told you beforehand.
040	MAT	024	026	If therefore they say to you, Lo! he is in the wilderness; go not forth; lo! he is in the private chambers; believe them not.
040	MAT	024	027	For as the lightning cometh from the east, and shineth even to the west, so will be the coming of the Son of man.
040	MAT	024	028	Wherever the carcass is, there will the eagles be gathered together.
040	MAT	024	029	And immediately after the distress of those days will the sun be darkened, and the moon will not give her light, and the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.
040	MAT	024	030	And then will appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven; and all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and will see the Son of man coming upon the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.
040	MAT	024	031	And he will send forth his angels with a great trumpet, and they will gather his chosen from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.
040	MAT	024	032	And from the fig-tree learn its parable. When its branch hath now become tender, and putteth forth its leaves, ye know that summer is near.
040	MAT	024	033	So also, when ye see all these things, know ye that he is near, at the doors.
040	MAT	024	034	Truly do I say to you, This generation will not pass away, till all these things take place.
040	MAT	024	035	Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.
040	MAT	024	036	But that day and hour knoweth no one, not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father only.
040	MAT	024	037	But as were the days of Noah, so will be the coming of the Son of man.
040	MAT	024	038	For as in the days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day when Noah entered the ark,
040	MAT	024	039	and knew not, until the flood came, and took them all away, so also will be the coming of the Son of man.
040	MAT	024	040	Then will two men be in the field; one will be taken, and one left.
040	MAT	024	041	Two women will be grinding at the mill; one will be taken, and one left.
040	MAT	024	042	Watch, therefore, for ye know not on what day your Lord is coming.
040	MAT	024	043	But be sure of this, that if the master of the house had known in what watch the thief was coming, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken through.
040	MAT	024	044	Therefore be ye also ready; for at an hour when ye think not, the Son of man cometh.
040	MAT	024	045	Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom his lord placed over his household, to give them their food in due season?
040	MAT	024	046	Happy is that servant whom his lord, when he cometh, shall find so doing.
040	MAT	024	047	Truly do I say to you, that he will place him in charge of all his substance.
040	MAT	024	048	But if the bad servant say in his heart, My lord is tarrying long;
040	MAT	024	049	and begin to beat his fellow-servants, and eat and drink with the drunken,
040	MAT	024	050	the lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for it, and at an hour when he is not aware;
040	MAT	024	051	and will cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites; there will be wailing and gnashing of teeth.
040	MAT	025	001	Then the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins, who took their lamps, and went out to meet the bridegroom.
040	MAT	025	002	And five of them were foolish, and five wise.
040	MAT	025	003	For the foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them.
040	MAT	025	004	But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.
040	MAT	025	005	And as the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.
040	MAT	025	006	But at midnight there was a cry, Lo! the bridegroom! go out to meet him.
040	MAT	025	007	Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.
040	MAT	025	008	And the foolish said to the wise, Give us of your oil, for our lamps are going out.
040	MAT	025	009	But the wise answered, saying, Perhaps there will not be enough for us and you; go rather to those who sell, and buy for yourselves.
040	MAT	025	010	And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they who were ready went in with him to the wedding; and the door was shut.
040	MAT	025	011	Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, lord, open to us.
040	MAT	025	012	But he answering said, Truly do I say to you, I know you not,
040	MAT	025	013	Watch, therefore, for ye know not the day nor the hour.
040	MAT	025	014	For it will be as when a man going abroad called his own servants, and intrusted to them his property;
040	MAT	025	015	and to one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one, to each according to his ability, and went abroad.
040	MAT	025	016	He that had received the five talents went immediately and traded with the same, and gained five talents more.
040	MAT	025	017	In like manner, he that had received the two gained two more.
040	MAT	025	018	But he that had received the one went and dug in the earth, and hid his lord's money.
040	MAT	025	019	And after a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them.
040	MAT	025	020	And he that had received the five talents came and brought five talents more, saying, Lord, thou intrustedst to me five talents; see, I have gained five talents more.
040	MAT	025	021	His lord said to him, Well done, good and faithful servant! thou hast been faithful over a little, I will place thee in charge of much; enter into the joy of thy lord.
040	MAT	025	022	He also that had received the two talents came and said, Lord, thou intrustedst to me two talents; see, I have gained two talents more.
040	MAT	025	023	His lord said to him, Well done, good and faithful servant! thou hast been faithful over a little, I will place thee in charge of much; enter into the joy of thy lord.
040	MAT	025	024	Then he also that had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee to be a hard man, reaping where thou didst not sow, and gathering where thou didst not scatter seed;
040	MAT	025	025	and I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth. See! thou hast thine own.
040	MAT	025	026	But his lord answered and said to him, Wicked and slothful servant! Didst thou know that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I did not scatter seed?
040	MAT	025	027	Thou oughtest then to have put my money with the money-dealers, and on my coming I should have received mine own with interest.
040	MAT	025	028	Take therefore the talent from him, and give it to him who hath the ten talents.
040	MAT	025	029	For to every one that hath will be given, and he will have abundance; but from him that hath not, even that which he hath will be taken away.
040	MAT	025	030	And cast out the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness; there will be wailing and gnashing of teeth.
040	MAT	025	031	And when the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the angels with him, then will he sit on the throne of his glory,
040	MAT	025	032	and before him will be gathered all the nations; and he will separate men one from another, as a shepherd separateth the sheep from the goats;
040	MAT	025	033	and he will set the sheep on his right hand, and the goats on the left.
040	MAT	025	034	Then will the king say to those on his right hand, Come, ye blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.
040	MAT	025	035	For I was hungry, and ye gave me food; I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink; I was a stranger, and ye took me in;
040	MAT	025	036	naked, and ye clothed me; I was sick, and ye visited me; I was in prison, and ye came to me.
040	MAT	025	037	Then will the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee hungry, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?
040	MAT	025	038	and when saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?
040	MAT	025	039	or when did we see thee sick, or in prison, and come to thee?
040	MAT	025	040	And the king will answer and say to them, Truly do I say to you, Inasmuch as ye did it to one of the least of these my brethren, ye did it to me.
040	MAT	025	041	Then will he say also to those on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into the everlasting fire, which is prepared for the Devil and his angels.
040	MAT	025	042	For I was hungry, and ye gave me no food; I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink;
040	MAT	025	043	I was a stranger, and ye took me not in; naked, and ye clothed me not; sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.
040	MAT	025	044	Then will they also answer, saying, Lord, when saw we thee hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister to thee?
040	MAT	025	045	Then will he answer them, saying, Truly do I say to you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me.
040	MAT	025	046	And these will go away into everlasting punishment; but the righteous into everlasting life.
040	MAT	026	001	And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, that he said to his disciples,
040	MAT	026	002	Ye know that after two days cometh the passover; and the Son of man is delivered up to be crucified.
040	MAT	026	003	Then the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the court of the palace of the high-priest, named Caiaphas;
040	MAT	026	004	and took counsel together that they might seize Jesus by craft, and put him to death.
040	MAT	026	005	But they said, Not at the feast, lest there be an uproar among the people.
040	MAT	026	006	Now when Jesus was at Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,
040	MAT	026	007	there came to him a woman having an alabaster bottle of very costly ointment, and poured it on his head while he was reclining at table.
040	MAT	026	008	But the disciples seeing it, were much displeased, saying, To what purpose is this waste?
040	MAT	026	009	For this might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.
040	MAT	026	010	And Jesus, perceiving it, said to them, Why do ye trouble the woman? For she hath done a good deed to me.
040	MAT	026	011	For the poor ye have always with you; but me ye have not always.
040	MAT	026	012	For she, in pouring this ointment on my body, hath done it to prepare me for burial.
040	MAT	026	013	Truly do I say to you, Wherever these glad tidings shall be published in the whole world, this too which she hath done will be told for a memorial of her.
040	MAT	026	014	Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests,
040	MAT	026	015	and said, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him up to you? And they paid him thirty pieces of silver.
040	MAT	026	016	And from that time he sought an opportunity to deliver him up.
040	MAT	026	017	And on the first of the days of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Where wilt thou that we make ready for thee to eat the passover?
040	MAT	026	018	And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say to him, The Teacher saith, My time is at hand; I keep the passover at thy house with my disciples.
040	MAT	026	019	And the disciples did as Jesus directed them, and made ready the passover.
040	MAT	026	020	And when evening came, he took his place at table with the twelve disciples.
040	MAT	026	021	And as they were eating, he said, Truly do I say to you, that one of you will betray me.
040	MAT	026	022	And they were exceedingly sorrowful, and began every one to say to him, Is it I, Lord?
040	MAT	026	023	And he answering said, He that hath dipped his hand with me in the dish, he will betray me.
040	MAT	026	024	The Son of man indeed goeth away, as it hath been written concerning him; but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! Well were it for that man if he had not been born.
040	MAT	026	025	Then Judas, his betrayer, answering said, Is it I, Rabbi? He saith to him, It is.
040	MAT	026	026	And, as they were eating, Jesus took a loaf, and having blessed, broke it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.
040	MAT	026	027	And he took a cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it;
040	MAT	026	028	for this is my blood of the covenant, which is shed for many for remission of sins.
040	MAT	026	029	And I say to you, I shall not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in the kingdom of my Father.
040	MAT	026	030	And having sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
040	MAT	026	031	Then Jesus saith to them, This night will all of you fall away from me; for it is written, “I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.”
040	MAT	026	032	But after I have risen, I will go before you into Galilee.
040	MAT	026	033	Peter answering said to him, Though all should fall away from thee, yet will I never fall away.
040	MAT	026	034	Jesus said to him, Truly do I say to thee, that this night, before a cock crows, thou wilt thrice deny me.
040	MAT	026	035	Peter saith to him, Even if I must die with thee, I will not deny thee. And so said all the disciples.
040	MAT	026	036	Then Jesus cometh with them to a place called Gethsemane, and saith to the disciples, Sit here, while I go yonder and pray.
040	MAT	026	037	And taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to he sorrowful and full of anguish.
040	MAT	026	038	Then he saith to them, My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death; remain here, and watch with me.
040	MAT	026	039	And he came a little nearer, and fell on his face, praying and saying, Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me! nevertheless, not as I will, but as Thou wilt.
040	MAT	026	040	And he cometh to the disciples, and findeth them sleeping, and saith to Peter, Is it so that ye could not watch with me one hour?
040	MAT	026	041	Watch, and pray that ye enter not into temptation; the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.
040	MAT	026	042	Again he went away a second time, and prayed, saying, My Father, if this [[cup]] cannot pass away from me, but I must drink it, thy will be done!
040	MAT	026	043	And coming again he found them sleeping; for their eyes were heavy.
040	MAT	026	044	And leaving them, he went away again, and prayed the third time, saying again the same words.
040	MAT	026	045	Then he cometh to the disciples, and saith to them, Sleep on, and take your rest! Lo! the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is delivered up into the hands of sinners.
040	MAT	026	046	Rise, let us be going; lo! he is at hand that delivereth me up.
040	MAT	026	047	And while he was yet speaking, lo! Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and elders of the people.
040	MAT	026	048	And his betrayer had given them a sign, saying, Whomever I shall kiss, he is the man; seize him.
040	MAT	026	049	And immediately going up to Jesus, he said, Hail, Rabbi! and kissed him.
040	MAT	026	050	And Jesus said to him, Friend, for what hast thou come! Then they came and laid hands on Jesus, and seized him.
040	MAT	026	051	And, lo! one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck the servant of the high-priest, and cut off his ear.
040	MAT	026	052	Then Jesus saith to him, Put back thy sword into its place; for all they that take the sword will perish by the sword.
040	MAT	026	053	Dost thou think that I cannot pray to my Father, and he will now give me more than twelve legions of angels?
040	MAT	026	054	But how then shall the Scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?
040	MAT	026	055	In that hour Jesus said to the multitudes, Ye have come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs to take me; I sat daily teaching in the temple, and ye did not lay hands on me.
040	MAT	026	056	But all this hath been done, that the Scriptures of the prophets may be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.
040	MAT	026	057	And they who seized Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high-priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.
040	MAT	026	058	But Peter followed him at a distance, as far as to the court of the high-priest's palace, and went in, and sat with the officers to see the end.
040	MAT	026	059	And the chief priests and the whole council sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;
040	MAT	026	060	and they found none, though many false witnesses came forward. But at last came two,
040	MAT	026	061	and said, This man affirmed, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it within three days.
040	MAT	026	062	And the high-priest arose, and said to him, Dost thou make no answer to what these men testify against thee?
040	MAT	026	063	But Jesus was silent. And the high-priest answering said to him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou art the Christ, the Son of God.
040	MAT	026	064	Jesus saith to him, I am. Moreover I say to you, Henceforth ye will see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of Power, and coming on the clouds of heaven.
040	MAT	026	065	Then the high-priest rent his garments, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? See! ye have now heard the blasphemy.
040	MAT	026	066	What think ye? They answered and said, He should be punished with death.
040	MAT	026	067	Then they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and some smote him with the palms of their hands,
040	MAT	026	068	saying, Prophesy to us, O Messiah! who it was that struck thee.
040	MAT	026	069	Now Peter was sitting outside in the court. And a maid-servant came to him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus the Galilaean.
040	MAT	026	070	But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.
040	MAT	026	071	And when he had gone out into the porch, another woman saw him, and said to those who were there, This man was with Jesus the Nazarene.
040	MAT	026	072	And again he denied with an oath; I do not know the man.
040	MAT	026	073	And shortly after, they who were standing by came and said to Peter, Surely thou too art one of them; for thy speech betrayeth thee.
040	MAT	026	074	Then he began to curse and to swear, saying, I do not know the man. And immediately a cock crew.
040	MAT	026	075	And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, who had said, Before a cock crows, thou wilt thrice deny me. And he went out, and wept bitterly.
040	MAT	027	001	And when it was morning, all the chief priests and the elders of the people consulted together against Jesus, to put him to death.
040	MAT	027	002	And having bound him, they led him away, and delivered him up to Pilate the governor.
040	MAT	027	003	Then Judas, who betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented, and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,
040	MAT	027	004	saying, I sinned in betraying innocent blood. And they said, What is that to us? See thou to it.
040	MAT	027	005	And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and withdrew; and went away and hanged himself.
040	MAT	027	006	And the chief priests took the pieces of silver, and said, It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since they are the price of blood.
040	MAT	027	007	And they consulted together, and bought with them the potter's field, for a burial-place for strangers.
040	MAT	027	008	Wherefore that field hath been called, The Field of Blood, unto this day.
040	MAT	027	009	Then was fulfilled that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet, saying, “And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was priced, whom they of the sons of Israel priced,
040	MAT	027	010	and gave them for the potter's field; as the Lord commanded me.”
040	MAT	027	011	And Jesus stood before the governor; and the governor questioned him, saying, Art thou the king of the Jews? And Jesus said, I am.
040	MAT	027	012	And when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he made no answer.
040	MAT	027	013	Then saith Pilate to him, Dost thou not hear what things they are testifying against thee?
040	MAT	027	014	And he made him no answer, not even to one word; so that the governor greatly wondered.
040	MAT	027	015	Now at the feast the governor was wont to release to the multitude one prisoner, whom they would.
040	MAT	027	016	And they had then a notorious prisoner, called Barabbas.
040	MAT	027	017	When therefore they were assembled, Pilate said to them, Whom will ye that I release to you? Barabbas, or Jesus, who is called Christ?
040	MAT	027	018	For he knew that for envy they had delivered him up.
040	MAT	027	019	And while he was sitting on the judgment-seat, his wife sent to him, saying, Have nothing to do with that righteous man; for I have suffered much this day in a dream because of him.
040	MAT	027	020	But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitudes to ask for Barabbas, and to destroy Jesus.
040	MAT	027	021	And the governor answering said to them, Which of the two will ye that I release to you? And they said, Barabbas.
040	MAT	027	022	Pilate saith to them, What then shall I do with Jesus, who is called Christ? They all say, Let him be crucified.
040	MAT	027	023	And he said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.
040	MAT	027	024	And when Pilate saw that it availed nothing, but that rather a tumult was arising, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of this blood; see ye to it.
040	MAT	027	025	And all the people answering said, His blood be on us, and on our children.
040	MAT	027	026	Then he released Barabbas to them, and having scourged Jesus, he delivered him up to be crucified.
040	MAT	027	027	Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the governor's palace, and gathered to him the whole band.
040	MAT	027	028	And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.
040	MAT	027	029	And having platted a crown of thorns, they put it on his head, and a reed in his right hand; and bowing the knee before him, they mocked him, saying, Hail, king of the Jews!
040	MAT	027	030	And they spit upon him, and took the reed and struck him on the head.
040	MAT	027	031	And after they had made sport of him, they took off the robe from him, and put on him his own garments, and led him away to crucify him.
040	MAT	027	032	And as they were going out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name, whom they compelled to carry his cross.
040	MAT	027	033	And having come to a place called Golgotha, that is, Place of a Skull,
040	MAT	027	034	they gave him wine to drink mingled with gall; and when he had tasted it, he refused to drink.
040	MAT	027	035	And when they had crucified him, they divided his garments among them, casting lots.
040	MAT	027	036	And sitting down, they watched him there.
040	MAT	027	037	And they set up over his head the charge against him in writing: “This is Jesus the king of the Jews.”
040	MAT	027	038	Then are crucified with him two robbers, one on the right hand, and one on the left.
040	MAT	027	039	And they who passed by reviled him, wagging their heads,
040	MAT	027	040	and saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it up in three days, save thyself, if thou art the Son of God, and come down from the cross.
040	MAT	027	041	So also the chief priests, mocking, with the scribes and elders, said,
040	MAT	027	042	He saved others, cannot he save himself? He is the king of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe in him.
040	MAT	027	043	He trusteth in God; let him now deliver him, if he desireth him; for he said, I am the Son of God.
040	MAT	027	044	The robbers also, who were crucified with him, reviled him in the same manner.
040	MAT	027	045	And from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land, until the ninth hour.
040	MAT	027	046	And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?
040	MAT	027	047	Some of those standing there, when they heard this, said, This man is calling for Elijah.
040	MAT	027	048	And one of them immediately ran and took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink.
040	MAT	027	049	But the rest said, Hold! let us see whether Elijah will come to save him.
040	MAT	027	050	And Jesus, crying out again with a loud voice, yielded up his spirit.
040	MAT	027	051	And, lo! the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom; and the earth, quaked, and the rocks were rent,
040	MAT	027	052	and the tombs were opened; and many bodies of holy men that slept, arose,
040	MAT	027	053	and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection went into the holy city and appeared to many.
040	MAT	027	054	And the centurion and they who with him were watching Jesus, when they saw the earthquake, and what was taking place, were exceedingly afraid, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.
040	MAT	027	055	And many women were there, looking on from a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, rendering services to him;
040	MAT	027	056	among whom was Mary the Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.
040	MAT	027	057	And at evening there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who was himself also a disciple of Jesus.
040	MAT	027	058	This man went to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered it to be given him.
040	MAT	027	059	And Joseph took the body, and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,
040	MAT	027	060	and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock, and having rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb, went away.
040	MAT	027	061	And Mary the Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre.
040	MAT	027	062	And on the next day, that following the day of the preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees came together to Pilate,
040	MAT	027	063	saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I rise.
040	MAT	027	064	Command therefore that the sepulchre be made secure until the third day, lest his disciples come and steal him away, and say to the people, He hath risen from the dead; and the last error will be worse than the first.
040	MAT	027	065	Pilate said to them, Ye have a guard; go, make it as secure as ye know how.
040	MAT	027	066	And they went, and made the sepulchre secure, sealing the stone, and setting the guard.
040	MAT	028	001	And the sabbath being over, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary the Magdalene, and the other Mary, to view the sepulchre.
040	MAT	028	002	And, lo! there was a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled away the stone, and sat upon it.
040	MAT	028	003	His appearance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow.
040	MAT	028	004	And for fear of him the keepers shook, and became as dead men.
040	MAT	028	005	And the angel answering said to the women, Fear ye not; for I know that ye are seeking Jesus, who was crucified.
040	MAT	028	006	He is not here; for he hath risen, as he said. Come, see the place where he lay.
040	MAT	028	007	And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he hath risen from the dead, and, lo! he is going before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him. Lo! I have told you.
040	MAT	028	008	And they went away quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to tell his disciples.
040	MAT	028	009	And lo! Jesus met them, saying, All hail! And they went up, and laid hold of his feet, and knelt down before him.
040	MAT	028	010	Then Jesus saith to them, Be not afraid; go, tell my brethren to depart into Galilee, and there they shall see me.
040	MAT	028	011	And as they were going, lo! some of the guard came into the city, and told the chief priests all that had taken place.
040	MAT	028	012	And having assembled with the elders, and taken counsel together, they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers,
040	MAT	028	013	saying, Say, His disciples came by night, and stole him away, while we slept.
040	MAT	028	014	And should the governor hear of this, we will persuade him, and make you secure.
040	MAT	028	015	So they took the money, and did as they were taught. And this story hath been commonly reported among the Jews to this day.
040	MAT	028	016	And the eleven disciples went into Galilee, into the mountain, where Jesus had directed them.
040	MAT	028	017	And when they saw him, they knelt down before him; but some doubted.
040	MAT	028	018	And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, All power was given to me in heaven and on earth.
040	MAT	028	019	Go, and make all nations my disciples, baptizing them into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit;
040	MAT	028	020	teaching them to observe all things, whatever I have commanded you. And, lo! I am with you always, unto the end of the world.

# BOOK	041	MAR	Mark	Mark
041	MAR	001	001	The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ;
041	MAR	001	002	as it is written in Isaiah the prophet: “Lo! I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way;”
041	MAR	001	003	“The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare the way of the Lord, make straight his paths!”
041	MAR	001	004	John the Baptizer appeared in the wilderness, preaching a baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.
041	MAR	001	005	And there went out to him all the country of Judaea, and all they of Jerusalem and were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.
041	MAR	001	006	And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a leathern girdle about his loins, and he ate locusts and wild honey.
041	MAR	001	007	And he preached, saying, There cometh after me one mightier than I, the latchet of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and loose.
041	MAR	001	008	I have baptized you with water; but he will baptize you in the Holy Spirit.
041	MAR	001	009	And it came to pass that in those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan.
041	MAR	001	010	And immediately on coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens parted, and the Spirit descending as a dove upon him.
041	MAR	001	011	And there was a voice from the heavens, “Thou art my beloved Son; with thee I am well pleased.”
041	MAR	001	012	And immediately the Spirit driveth him forth into the wilderness.
041	MAR	001	013	And he was in the wilderness forty days, tempted by Satan, and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered to him.
041	MAR	001	014	But after John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the glad tidings of God,
041	MAR	001	015	[[saying, ]] The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent, and believe the glad tidings.
041	MAR	001	016	And as he was passing along by the lake of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon dragging a net in the lake; for they were fishers.
041	MAR	001	017	And Jesus said to them, Come after me, and I will cause you to become fishers of men.
041	MAR	001	018	And immediately they left their nets, and followed him.
041	MAR	001	019	And going on a little farther, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the boat mending the nets;
041	MAR	001	020	and immediately he called them. And leaving their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men, they went after him.
041	MAR	001	021	And they enter Capernaum; and immediately on the sabbath he was teaching in the synagogue.
041	MAR	001	022	And they were astonished at his teaching; for he taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes.
041	MAR	001	023	And immediately there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit, and he cried out,
041	MAR	001	024	saying, What have we to do with thee, Jesus of Nazareth? Thou hast come to destroy us; we know who thou art, the Holy One of God.
041	MAR	001	025	And Jesus rebuked him, [[saying, ]] Be silent, and come out of him.
041	MAR	001	026	And the unclean spirit convulsing him, and crying out with a loud voice, came out of him.
041	MAR	001	027	And they were all amazed, so that they questioned each other, saying, What is this? New teaching with authority; even the unclean spirits doth he command, and they obey him!
041	MAR	001	028	And immediately his fame spread abroad everywhere through the whole surrounding country of Galilee.
041	MAR	001	029	And having come out of the synagogue, they immediately entered the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.
041	MAR	001	030	And Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever; and they immediately speak to him about her.
041	MAR	001	031	And he went to her, and took her by the hand, and raised her up; and the fever left her, and she waited on them.
041	MAR	001	032	And in the evening, when the sun had set, they brought to him all that were sick, and those who were possessed by demons;
041	MAR	001	033	and the whole city was assembled at the door.
041	MAR	001	034	And he healed many that were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons; and he suffered not the demons to speak, because they knew him.
041	MAR	001	035	And rising early, long before day, he went out, and withdrew into a desert place, and there prayed.
041	MAR	001	036	And Simon and those with him went in search of him,
041	MAR	001	037	and found him. And they say to him, All people are in search of thee.
041	MAR	001	038	And he saith to them, Let us go elsewhere into the neighboring towns, that I may preach there also; for, for this I came forth.
041	MAR	001	039	And he went, preaching in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and casting out the demons.
041	MAR	001	040	And there cometh a leper to him beseeching him, and kneeling down, saying to him, If thou wilt, thou canst cleanse me.
041	MAR	001	041	And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth his hand, and touched him, and saith, I will; be thou cleansed.
041	MAR	001	042	And immediately the leprosy left him, and he was cleansed.
041	MAR	001	043	And sternly charging him, he immediately sent him away,
041	MAR	001	044	saying to him, See that thou say nothing to any one; but go, show thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing what Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.
041	MAR	001	045	But he went away, and began to publish it constantly, and to spread the matter abroad, so that Jesus could no more enter a city openly, but was without in desert places; and they came to him from every quarter.
041	MAR	002	001	And after some days he again entered Capernaum; and it was reported that he was in the house.
041	MAR	002	002	And many were gathered together, so that there was no longer room for them, even at the door; and he was speaking the word to them.
041	MAR	002	003	And they come to him, bringing one that was palsied, borne by four men.
041	MAR	002	004	And not being able to bring him to him on account of the crowd, they took off the roof where he was; and when they had broken an opening, they let down the bed whereon the palsied man lay.
041	MAR	002	005	And Jesus seeing their faith, saith to the palsied man, Son, thy sins are forgiven.
041	MAR	002	006	But there were some of the scribes sitting there and reasoning in their hearts,
041	MAR	002	007	Why doth this man speak thus? He blasphemeth; who can forgive sins but God only?
041	MAR	002	008	And Jesus immediately perceiving in his spirit that they reasoned thus within themselves, saith to them, Why do ye reason thus in your hearts?
041	MAR	002	009	Which is easier? to say to the palsied man, Thy sins are forgiven? or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed and go?
041	MAR	002	010	But that ye may know that the Son of man hath authority on earth to forgive sins, —he saith to the palsied man, —
041	MAR	002	011	I say to thee, Arise, take up thy bed and go to thy house.
041	MAR	002	012	And he arose, and immediately took up the bed and went forth before them all; so that they were all amazed, and gave glory to God, saying, We never saw it thus.
041	MAR	002	013	And he went forth again to the lake; and all the multitude came to him, and he taught them.
041	MAR	002	014	And passing along, he saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus, sitting at the custom-house; and he saith to him, Follow me. And he arose and followed him.
041	MAR	002	015	And it happened that he was reclining at table in his house; and many publicans and sinners were reclining with Jesus and his disciples; for there were many, and scribes of the Pharisees were also following him.
041	MAR	002	016	And when they saw that he was eating with the publicans and sinners, they said to his disciples, Doth he eat and drink with publicans and sinners?
041	MAR	002	017	And Jesus hearing it, saith to them, They who are well do not need a physician, but they who are sick. I came not to call righteous men, but sinners.
041	MAR	002	018	And the disciples of John and the Pharisees were fasting; and they come and say to him, Why do the disciples of John and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, and thy disciples fast not?
041	MAR	002	019	And Jesus said to them, Can the companions of the bridegroom fast, while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.
041	MAR	002	020	But the days will come, when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and then will they fast in that day.
041	MAR	002	021	No one seweth a patch of undressed cloth on an old garment; for the new piece teareth away from the old garment, and a worse rent is made.
041	MAR	002	022	And no one putteth new wine into old skins; for the new wine will burst the skins, and the wine is lost, and the skins.
041	MAR	002	023	And it came to pass, that he was going through the grain-fields on the sabbath, and his disciples began, as they went along, to pluck the ears of grain.
041	MAR	002	024	And the Pharisees said to him, See, why are they doing on the sabbath that which is not lawful?
041	MAR	002	025	And he saith to them, Did ye never read what David did, when he had need, and was hungry, himself and they who were with him?
041	MAR	002	026	how he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high-priest, and ate the show-bread, which it is lawful for none but the priests to eat, and gave also to those who were with him?
041	MAR	002	027	And he said to them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath.
041	MAR	002	028	So that the Son of man is lord even of the sabbath.
041	MAR	003	001	And he entered again into a synagogue; and there was a man there having a withered hand;
041	MAR	003	002	and they watched him, whether he would heal him on the sabbath, that they might accuse him.
041	MAR	003	003	And he saith to the man having the withered hand, Stand up in the midst.
041	MAR	003	004	And he saith to them, Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath, or to do evil? to save life, or to kill? But they were silent.
041	MAR	003	005	And looking round on them with anger, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts, he saith to the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he stretched it forth; and his hand was restored.
041	MAR	003	006	And the Pharisees went forth, and immediately had a consultation with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.
041	MAR	003	007	And Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the lake; and a great multitude from Galilee, and from Judaea followed;
041	MAR	003	008	and from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and from beyond the Jordan, and the people about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they heard what great things he was doing, came to him.
041	MAR	003	009	And he gave direction to his disciples, that a boat should be in readiness for him because of the multitude, that they might not throng him.
041	MAR	003	010	For he had healed many, so that as many as had plagues pressed upon him to touch him.
041	MAR	003	011	And the unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and cried out, saying, Thou art the Son of God.
041	MAR	003	012	And he strictly charged them that they should not make him known.
041	MAR	003	013	And he goeth up into the mountain, and calleth to him whom he would; and they came to him.
041	MAR	003	014	And he appointed twelve to be with him, and whom he might send forth to preach,
041	MAR	003	015	and to have authority to cast out demons. And he appointed the twelve,
041	MAR	003	016	and Simon he surnamed Peter;
041	MAR	003	017	and James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and he surnamed them Boanerges, that is, Sons of thunder;
041	MAR	003	018	and Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon of Cana,
041	MAR	003	019	and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him. And he cometh into the house.
041	MAR	003	020	And again a multitude cometh together, so that they could not so much as eat bread.
041	MAR	003	021	And his relations hearing of it went out to lay hold of him; for they said, He is beside himself.
041	MAR	003	022	And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, He hath Beelzebul; and, He casteth out the demons through the prince of the demons.
041	MAR	003	023	And calling them to him, he said to them in parables: How can Satan cast out Satan?
041	MAR	003	024	And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand;
041	MAR	003	025	and if a house be divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand;
041	MAR	003	026	and if Satan rise up against himself, he is divided, and cannot stand, but hath an end.
041	MAR	003	027	Moreover, no one can enter into a strong man's house, and plunder his goods, unless he first bind the strong man; and then he will plunder his house.
041	MAR	003	028	Truly do I say to you, All sins will be forgiven the sons of men, and the blasphemies wherewith they shall blaspheme;
041	MAR	003	029	but he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Spirit hath no forgiveness forever, but is exposed to everlasting sin.—
041	MAR	003	030	Because they said, He hath an unclean spirit.
041	MAR	003	031	And his mother and his brothers came; and, standing without, sent to him, to call him.
041	MAR	003	032	And a multitude was sitting about him; and they say to him, Lo! thy mother and thy brothers and thy sisters are without, seeking for thee.
041	MAR	003	033	And he answering saith to them, Who is my mother, and my brothers?
041	MAR	003	034	And looking round on those who sat about him, he saith, Behold my mother and my brothers.
041	MAR	003	035	Whoever shall do the will of God, he is my brother, and sister, and mother.
041	MAR	004	001	And again he began to teach by the shore of the lake; and there was gathered to him a very great multitude, so that he went into a boat, and sat down in it upon the lake; and all the multitude was by the lake on the land.
041	MAR	004	002	And he taught them many things in parables, and said to them in his teaching,
041	MAR	004	003	Hearken: Behold, a sower went forth to sow.
041	MAR	004	004	And it came to pass, as he sowed some seeds fell by the way-side; and the birds came and devoured them.
041	MAR	004	005	And others fell on rocky ground, where they had not much earth; and they sprung up immediately, because they had no depth of earth.
041	MAR	004	006	But when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.
041	MAR	004	007	And others fell among thorns; and the thorns grew up, and choked them, and they yielded no fruit.
041	MAR	004	008	And others fell on good ground, and shooting up and growing yielded fruit; and bore as much as thirty, and sixty, and a hundred fold.
041	MAR	004	009	And he said, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
041	MAR	004	010	And when he was in private, they who were about him, with the twelve, asked him about the parables.
041	MAR	004	011	And he said to them, To you hath been given the mystery of the kingdom of God; but to them, who are without, all things are done in parables; t
041	MAR	004	012	hat seeing they may see, and not perceive, and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest they should turn, and be forgiven.
041	MAR	004	013	And he saith to them, Know ye not this parable? and how will ye know all the parables?
041	MAR	004	014	The sower soweth the word.
041	MAR	004	015	And these are they by the wayside, those where the word is sown, and when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in them.
041	MAR	004	016	And these in like manner are they that are sown on the rocky places, those, who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with joy,
041	MAR	004	017	and have no root in themselves, but endure only for a time; then, when affliction or persecution ariseth on account of the word, they immediately fall away.
041	MAR	004	018	And others are they that are sown among the thorns; these are they who hear the word,
041	MAR	004	019	but the cares of the world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful.
041	MAR	004	020	And these are they who are sown on the good ground; such as hear the word, and receive it; and bear fruit, thirty, sixty, and a hundred fold.
041	MAR	004	021	And he said to them, Is a lamp brought to be put under the bushel, or under the bed, and not to be set on the lamp-stand?
041	MAR	004	022	For there is nothing secret, unless to be made known; nor was any thing hidden, but that it should come to light.
041	MAR	004	023	If any one hath ears to hear, let him hear.
041	MAR	004	024	And he said to them, Take heed what ye hear. With what measure ye mete, it will be measured to you, and more will be added to you.
041	MAR	004	025	For he that hath, to him will be given; and he that hath not, from him will be taken away even what he hath.
041	MAR	004	026	And he said, Thus is the kingdom of God, as when a man has cast seed upon the ground,
041	MAR	004	027	and sleeps and rises night and day, and the seed springs and grows up, he knows not how.
041	MAR	004	028	For the earth brings forth fruit of itself, first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear.
041	MAR	004	029	But when the fruit puts itself forth, immediately he sends out the sickle, because the harvest is come.
041	MAR	004	030	And he said, To what shall we liken the kingdom of God? or under what comparison shall we set it forth?
041	MAR	004	031	It is like a grain of mustard, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that are in the earth;
041	MAR	004	032	and when it is sown, it grows up, and becomes greater than all the herbs, and puts forth great branches, so that the birds of the air can lodge under its shade.
041	MAR	004	033	And with many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear.
041	MAR	004	034	But without a parable he did not speak to them; but in private he explained all things to his own disciples.
041	MAR	004	035	And on the same day, when the evening was come, he saith to them, Let us pass over to the other side.
041	MAR	004	036	And leaving the multitude, they take him with them, as he was, in the boat; and there were also other boats with him.
041	MAR	004	037	And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves heat into the boat, so that it was already filling.
041	MAR	004	038	And he was in the stern, asleep on the pillow; and they awake him, and say to him, Teacher, carest thou not that we are perishing?
041	MAR	004	039	And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said to the waves, Peace! be still! And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.
041	MAR	004	040	And he said to them, Why are ye so fearful? How is it that ye have not faith?
041	MAR	004	041	And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, Who then is this, that even the wind and the waves obey him?
041	MAR	005	001	And they came to the other side of the lake, into the country of the Gerasenes.
041	MAR	005	002	And when he had come out of the boat, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,
041	MAR	005	003	who had his dwelling in the tombs; and not even with a chain could any one bind him any longer;
041	MAR	005	004	because he had often been bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been snapped asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces; and no one could master him;
041	MAR	005	005	and continually, night and day, in the tombs and in the mountains, he was crying out, and cutting himself, with stones.
041	MAR	005	006	And seeing Jesus afar off, he ran and bowed down before him,
041	MAR	005	007	and cried out with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God, do not torment me.
041	MAR	005	008	For he was saying to him, Unclean spirit, come out from the man.
041	MAR	005	009	And he asked him, What is thy name? And he saith to him, Legion is my name; for we are many.
041	MAR	005	010	And he besought him much not to send them out of the country.
041	MAR	005	011	Now there was there, by the mountain, a great herd of swine feeding.
041	MAR	005	012	And they besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them.
041	MAR	005	013	And he gave them leave. And the unclean spirits coming out, entered into the swine; and the herd rushed down the steep into the lake, about two thousand, and were drowned in the lake.
041	MAR	005	014	And they that fed them fled, and told the news in the city and in the country. And they came to see what had been done.
041	MAR	005	015	And they come to Jesus, and see him who had been possessed by demons, sitting, clothed, and in his right mind, —him who had had the legion; and they were afraid.
041	MAR	005	016	And they who saw it told them how it befell him that was possessed by the demons, and concerning the swine.
041	MAR	005	017	And they began to beseech him to depart from their borders.
041	MAR	005	018	And when he was going on board the boat, he that had been possessed by the demons besought him that be might be with him.
041	MAR	005	019	And he did not permit him, but said to him, Go to thy house to thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and that he hath had compassion on thee.
041	MAR	005	020	And he departed, and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him; and all wondered.
041	MAR	005	021	And when Jesus had crossed again in the boat to the ether side, a great multitude gathered about him; and he was by the lake.
041	MAR	005	022	And there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and seeing him, he fell at his feet,
041	MAR	005	023	and besought him much, saying, My little daughter lieth at the point of death; I pray thee, come and lay thy hands on her, that she may be saved and live.
041	MAR	005	024	And he went with him; and a great multitude followed him, and pressed upon him.
041	MAR	005	025	And a woman, who had had an issue of blood twelve years,
041	MAR	005	026	and had undergone much at the hands of many physicians, and spent all that she had, and was not at all benefited, but rather grew worse,
041	MAR	005	027	having heard about Jesus, came in the crowd behind, and touched his garment.
041	MAR	005	028	For she said, If I touch even his garments, I shall be made well.
041	MAR	005	029	And immediately the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she perceived in her body that she was cured of her plague.
041	MAR	005	030	And Jesus immediately perceiving in himself that power had gone out from him, turned round in the crowed, and said, Who touched my garments?
041	MAR	005	031	And his disciples said to him, Thou seest the multitude pressing on thee, and dost thou say, Who touched me?
041	MAR	005	032	And he looked round to see her who had done this.
041	MAR	005	033	But the woman, fearing and trembling, knowing what had been done to her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.
041	MAR	005	034	And he said to her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee well; go in peace, and be recovered from thy plague.
041	MAR	005	035	While he was yet speaking, there came from the house I of the ruler of the synagogue some who said, Thy daughter is dead; why dost thou trouble the Teacher any further?
041	MAR	005	036	And Jesus, overhearing those words, saith to the ruler of the synagogue, Fear not; only believe.
041	MAR	005	037	And he suffered no one to follow him except Peter and James, and John the brother of James.
041	MAR	005	038	And they come to the house of the ruler of the synagogue; and he seeth a tumult, and people weeping and wailing greatly.
041	MAR	005	039	And going in, he saith to them, Why do ye make this confusion and weeping? The child is not dead, but is sleeping.
041	MAR	005	040	And they laughed him to scorn. But putting them all out, he taketh the father of the child, and the mother, and those who were with him, and entereth where the child was.
041	MAR	005	041	And taking hold of the hand of the child, he saith to her, Talitha, kum; which is, when interpreted, Damsel, I say to thee, arise!
041	MAR	005	042	And immediately the damsel arose and walked; for she was twelve years old. And immediately they were greatly astonished.
041	MAR	005	043	And he charged them strictly that no one should know it, and bade that something should be given her to eat.
041	MAR	006	001	And he went out from thence, and cometh into his own country; and his disciples follow him.
041	MAR	006	002	And when the sabbath was come, he began to teach in the synagogue. And most people when they heard him were astonished, saying, Whence hath this man these things? And what is the wisdom which is given him? And how is it that such miracles are wrought by his hands?
041	MAR	006	003	Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and brother of James, and Joses, and Judah, and Simon? And are not his sisters here with us? And they took offence at him.
041	MAR	006	004	And Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honor except in his own country, and among his own kindred, and in his own house.
041	MAR	006	005	And he could not do any miracle there, except that he laid his hand upon a few sick persons, and cured them.
041	MAR	006	006	And he wondered at their want of faith. And he went about the surrounding villages teaching.
041	MAR	006	007	And he calleth to him the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and two; and gave them power over the unclean spirits;
041	MAR	006	008	and commanded them that they should take nothing for the way but a staff only; no bread, no bag, no money in their girdle;
041	MAR	006	009	but to be shod with sandals; and, Do not put on two coats.
041	MAR	006	010	And he said to them, Wherever ye enter a house, there abide fill ye leave that place.
041	MAR	006	011	And whatever place shall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye go thence, shake off the dust under your feet as a testimony to them.
041	MAR	006	012	And they went out and preached that men should repent;
041	MAR	006	013	and they cast out many demons, and anointed with oil many sick persons, and healed them.
041	MAR	006	014	And king Herod heard of him (for his name was spread abroad), and he said, John the Baptizer hath risen from the dead, and therefore do these powers work in him. But others said, It is Elijah.
041	MAR	006	015	And others said, It is a prophet, as one of the prophets.
041	MAR	006	016	But Herod hearing of it said, John, whom I beheaded, hath risen again.
041	MAR	006	017	For Herod himself had sent forth and seized John, and bound him in prison, on account of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife; for he had married her.
041	MAR	006	018	For John had said to Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother's wife.
041	MAR	006	019	And Herodias was enraged against him, and wished to put him to death, but could not.
041	MAR	006	020	For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and was regardful of him; and on hearing him, was in much anxiety, and listened to him gladly.
041	MAR	006	021	And a convenient day having come, when Herod on his birthday made a supper for his nobles and chief captains and the principal men of Galilee,
041	MAR	006	022	and the daughter of Herodias came in and danced, she pleased Herod and those at table with him; and the king said to the damsel, Ask of me whatever thou wilt, and I will give it thee.
041	MAR	006	023	And he swore to her, Whatever thou shalt ask of me, I will give thee, to the half of my kingdom.
041	MAR	006	024	And she went out and said to her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptizer.
041	MAR	006	025	And she came in immediately with haste to the king, and asked, saying, I desire that thou wilt give me immediately on a platter the head of John the Baptist.
041	MAR	006	026	And the king was exceedingly sorry; but on account of his oaths, and of those at table with him, he would not refuse her.
041	MAR	006	027	And the king immediately sent one of his guards, and ordered his head to be brought. And he went and beheaded him in the prison,
041	MAR	006	028	and brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the damsel; and the damsel gave it to her mother.
041	MAR	006	029	And his disciples, when they heard of it, came and took up his body, and laid it in a tomb.
041	MAR	006	030	And the apostles gather together to Jesus, and told him all which they had done and taught.
041	MAR	006	031	And he saith to them, Come ye by yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while. For there were many coming and going; and they had no leisure, even to eat.
041	MAR	006	032	And they went away into a desert place in the boat apart.
041	MAR	006	033	And many saw them departing, and knew them, and ran together on foot thither from all the cities, and arrived before them.
041	MAR	006	034	And when he came forth, he saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion for them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd; and he began to teach them many things.
041	MAR	006	035	And late in the day his disciples came to him, and said, This is a desert place, and it is now late;
041	MAR	006	036	send them away, that they may go into the surrounding fields and villages, and buy themselves something to eat.
041	MAR	006	037	But he answering said to them, Give ye them to eat. And they say to him, Shall we go and buy two hundred denaries' worth of bread, and give them to eat?
041	MAR	006	038	He saith to them, How many loaves have ye? Go and see. And when they knew, they say, Five, and two fishes.
041	MAR	006	039	And he ordered them to make all lie down in companies upon the green grass.
041	MAR	006	040	And they lay down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties.
041	MAR	006	041	And taking the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven and blessed, and broke the loaves, and gave them to the disciples to set before them; and the two fishes he divided among them all.
041	MAR	006	042	And they all ate, and were filled.
041	MAR	006	043	And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of the fishes.
041	MAR	006	044	And they who ate of the loaves were five thousand men.
041	MAR	006	045	And he immediately constrained his disciples to get into the boat, and to go before to the other side to Bethsaida, while he sent the multitude away.
041	MAR	006	046	And when he had taken leave of them, he went away into the mountain to pray.
041	MAR	006	047	And when evening came, the boat was in the midst of the lake; and he was alone on the land.
041	MAR	006	048	And when he saw them toiling hard in rowing, for the wind was against them, about the fourth watch of the night he cometh to them, walking upon the lake. And he would have passed by them;
041	MAR	006	049	but they, seeing him walking upon the lake, thought it was a spectre, and cried out.
041	MAR	006	050	For they all saw him, and were terrified. But he immediately spoke with them, and saith to them, Be of good cheer; it is I, be not afraid.
041	MAR	006	051	And he went up to them into the boat, and the wind ceased. And they were exceedingly astonished, beyond measure.
041	MAR	006	052	For they did not consider the matter of the loaves; but their heart was hardened.
041	MAR	006	053	And crossing over, they came to land, to Gennesaret; and anchored there.
041	MAR	006	054	And when they had come out of the boat, the people immediately knowing who he was,
041	MAR	006	055	ran through all that region, and began to carry about on beds those that were sick to the place where they heard he was.
041	MAR	006	056	And wherever he entered into villages or cities or the open country, they laid the sick in the market-places, and besought him that they might touch if it were but the fringe of his garment; and as many as touched him were made well.
041	MAR	007	001	And there come together to him the Pharisees, and some of the scribes, who came from Jerusalem;
041	MAR	007	002	and seeing some of his disciples eating bread with defiled, that is, unwashed hands,
041	MAR	007	003	(for the Pharisees, and all the Jews, unless they wash their hands often, do not eat, holding fast the tradition of the elders;
041	MAR	007	004	and on coming from the marketplace, unless they bathe, they do not eat; and there are many other things which they have received to hold, the dipping of cups, and pitchers, and brazen vessels; )
041	MAR	007	005	then the Pharisees and scribes ask him, Why do not thy disciples walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with defiled hands?
041	MAR	007	006	And he said to them, Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written, “This people honoreth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.
041	MAR	007	007	But in vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.”
041	MAR	007	008	Laying aside, the commandment of God, ye hold fast the tradition of men.
041	MAR	007	009	And he said to them, Full well do ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your tradition!
041	MAR	007	010	For Moses said, “Honor thy father and thy mother;” and, “He that curseth father or mother, let him surely die.”
041	MAR	007	011	But ye say, If a man say to his father or mother, Whatever thou mightst receive in aid from me is Corban, that is, a gift to God, [[he is not bound by the command. Thus]]
041	MAR	007	012	ye suffer him no longer to do anything for his father or his mother;
041	MAR	007	013	making void the word of God by your tradition, which ye have handed down; and many such things ye do.
041	MAR	007	014	And again calling the multitude to him, he said to them, Hearken to me all of you, and understand.
041	MAR	007	015	Nothing that entereth into a man from without can defile him; but the things that come out of him are what defile a man.
041	MAR	007	017	And when he had gone into the house from the crowd, his disciples asked him concerning the parable.
041	MAR	007	018	And he saith to them, Are ye too so without discernment? Do ye not understand that whatever thing from without entereth into a man, cannot defile him?
041	MAR	007	019	because it entereth not into his heart, but into the stomach; and goeth out into the drain, which cleanseth all kinds of food.
041	MAR	007	020	And he said, That which cometh out of a man, that defileth a man.
041	MAR	007	021	For from within, out of the heart of men, come forth evil thoughts, fornications,
041	MAR	007	022	thefts, murders, adulteries, covetousness, iniquities, deceit, wantonness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness.
041	MAR	007	023	All these evil things come from within, and defile a man.
041	MAR	007	024	And rising up, he departed thence into the borders of Tyre; and entering into a house, he desired that no one should know it; but he could not escape notice.
041	MAR	007	025	But a woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, immediately hearing of him, came in, and fell at his feet.
041	MAR	007	026	The woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by nation; and she besought him that he would cast out the demon from her daughter.
041	MAR	007	027	And he said to her, Let the children be filled first; for it is not well to take the children's bread and throw it to the little dogs.
041	MAR	007	028	But she answered, and saith to him, Yea, Lord; even the little dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs.
041	MAR	007	029	And he said to her, For this saying go thy way; the demon hath gone out of thy daughter.
041	MAR	007	030	And going away to her house, she found the child laid upon the bed, and the demon gone out.
041	MAR	007	031	And again leaving the borders of Tyre, he came through Sidon to the lake of Galilee, through the midst of the borders of Decapolis.
041	MAR	007	032	And they bring to him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech, and beseech him to lay his hand upon him.
041	MAR	007	033	And taking him aside from the multitude, he put his fingers into his ears, and having spit, touched his tongue;
041	MAR	007	034	and looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith to him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.
041	MAR	007	035	And his ears were opened; and the string of his tongue was immediately loosed, and he spoke plain.
041	MAR	007	036	And he charged them to tell no one; but the more he charged them, the more did they publish it.
041	MAR	007	037	And they were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well; he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.
041	MAR	008	001	In those days, there being again a great multitude, and they having nothing to eat, he called the disciples to him, and saith to them,
041	MAR	008	002	I have compassion on the multitude, because they have remained with me now three days, and they have nothing to eat.
041	MAR	008	003	And if I send them away fasting to their houses, they will faint on the road; and some of them have come from altar.
041	MAR	008	004	And his disciples answered him, Whence can ally one satisfy these men with bread here in a wilderness?
041	MAR	008	005	And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven.
041	MAR	008	006	And he ordered the multitude to lie down on the ground; and he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and broke, and gave to his disciples to set before them; and they set them before the multitude.
041	MAR	008	007	And they had a few small fishes; and having blessed them, he set them before them.
041	MAR	008	008	And they ate, and were filled; and they took up of the fragments that remained, seven baskets.
041	MAR	008	009	And they were about four thousand; and he sent them away.
041	MAR	008	010	And immediately going on board the boat with his disciples, he came into the region of Dalmanutha.
041	MAR	008	011	And the Pharisees came out, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, trying him.
041	MAR	008	012	And sighing deeply in his spirit, he saith, Why doth this generation seek for a sign? Truly do I say to you, A sign will not he given to this generation.
041	MAR	008	013	And leaving them, he again went on board and crossed to the other side.
041	MAR	008	014	And they had forgotten to take bread, and had not in the boat with them more than one loaf.
041	MAR	008	015	And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and the leaven of Herod.
041	MAR	008	016	And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have no bread.
041	MAR	008	017	And knowing it, he saith to them, Why are ye reasoning, because ye have no bread? Do ye not yet perceive nor understand? Have ye your mind still blinded?
041	MAR	008	018	Having eyes, do ye not see? and having ears, do ye not hear? And do ye not remember,
041	MAR	008	019	when I broke the five loaves among the five thousand, and how many baskets full of fragments ye took up? They say to him, Twelve.
041	MAR	008	020	When also the seven among the four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments did ye take up? And they say, Seven.
041	MAR	008	021	And he said to them, Do ye not yet understand?
041	MAR	008	022	And they come to Bethsaida. And they bring to him a blind man, and beseech him to touch him.
041	MAR	008	023	And taking the blind man by the hand, he led him out of the village; and spitting on his eyes, and putting his hands on him, he asked him if he saw anything.
041	MAR	008	024	And he looked up, and said, I can see men, for I see them as trees, walking.
041	MAR	008	025	Then he again put his hands on his eyes, and he saw clearly, and was restored, and saw all things distinctly.
041	MAR	008	026	And he sent him away to his house, saying, Go not into the village.
041	MAR	008	027	And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the villages of Caesarea Philippi. And on the way he asked his disciples, saying to them, Who do men say that I am?
041	MAR	008	028	And they answered him, saying, John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; and others, One of the prophets.
041	MAR	008	029	And he asked them, But who do ye say that I am? Peter answering saith to him, Thou art the Christ.
041	MAR	008	030	And he strictly charged them to tell no one concerning him.
041	MAR	008	031	And he began to teach them that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes, and be put to death, and after three days rise again;
041	MAR	008	032	and he told them this plainly. And Peter, taking him aside, began to rebuke him.
041	MAR	008	033	But he turning about and looking at his disciples, rebuked Peter, and saith, Get thee behind me, Satan! for thy thoughts are not on the things of God, but on those of men.
041	MAR	008	034	And calling the multitude to him with his disciples also, he said to them, Whoever chooseth to follow me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.
041	MAR	008	035	For whoever chooseth to save his life, will lose it; but whoever shall lose his life for the sake of me and of the glad tidings, will save it.
041	MAR	008	036	For what doth it profit a man to gain the whole world, and forfeit his life?
041	MAR	008	037	For what can a man give as an exchange for his life?
041	MAR	008	038	For whoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him will also the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.
041	MAR	009	001	And he said to them, Truly do I say to you, There are some of those standing here who will not taste of death, till they have seen that the kingdom of God hath come with power.
041	MAR	009	002	And after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter and James and John, and leadeth them up into a high mountain apart by themselves; and he was transfigured before them.
041	MAR	009	003	And his garments became glistening, very white, so as no fuller on earth can whiten.
041	MAR	009	004	And there appeared to them Elijah with Moses; and they were talking with Jesus.
041	MAR	009	005	And Peter answering saith to Jesus, Rabbi, it is good for us to be here; and let us make three tents, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.
041	MAR	009	006	For he knew not what to answer; for they were struck with terror.
041	MAR	009	007	And there came a cloud overshadowing them; and a voice came out of the cloud, This is my beloved Son; hear him.
041	MAR	009	008	And suddenly looking round, they no longer saw any one but Jesus alone with themselves.
041	MAR	009	009	And as they came down from the mountain, he charged them to give no account of what they had seen to any one, till the Son of man should have risen from the dead.
041	MAR	009	010	And they kept these words in mind, questioning one another what rising from the dead might mean.
041	MAR	009	011	And they asked him, saying, How is it that the Pharisees and scribes say that Elijah must come first?
041	MAR	009	012	And he said to them, Elijah cometh first, and restoreth all things. And how hath it been written of the Son of man? that he must suffer many things, and be set at nought.
041	MAR	009	013	But I say to you that Elijah hath come, and they have done to him whatever they would; as it hath been written concerning him.
041	MAR	009	014	And coming to the disciples, they saw a great multitude about them, and scribes debating with them.
041	MAR	009	015	And immediately the whole multitude on seeing him was struck with awe, and running to him, saluted him.
041	MAR	009	016	And he asked them, About what are ye debating with them?
041	MAR	009	017	And one of the multitude answered him, Teacher, I have brought to thee my son, who hath a dumb spirit.
041	MAR	009	018	And wherever it seizeth hold of him, it throweth him down; and he foameth and gnasheth his teeth; and he pineth away. And I spoke to thy disciples to cast it out, and they were not able.
041	MAR	009	019	He answereth and saith to them, O unbelieving generation! How long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him to me.
041	MAR	009	020	And they brought him to him. And as soon as he saw him, the spirit convulsed him; and he fell on the ground, and wallowed, foaming.
041	MAR	009	021	And he asked his father, How long hath it been thus with him? And he said, From a child;
041	MAR	009	022	and it hath often cast him both into fire, and into water, to destroy him; but if thou art able to do any thing, have compassion on us, and help us.
041	MAR	009	023	Jesus said to him, If thou art able? All things are possible for him that believeth.
041	MAR	009	024	The father of the child immediately cried out and said, I believe; help thou my unbelief.
041	MAR	009	025	And Jesus seeing that the multitude came running together, rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it, Dumb and deaf spirit, I command thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him.
041	MAR	009	026	And uttering a cry, and convulsing him much, it came out of him. And he became as one dead; so that very many said, He is dead.
041	MAR	009	027	But Jesus, taking hold of his hand, raised him, and he stood up.
041	MAR	009	028	And when he had come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, Why could not we cast it out?
041	MAR	009	029	And he said to them, This kind can go out by nothing, except by prayer.
041	MAR	009	030	And departing thence, they passed through Galilee; and he would not that any one should know it.
041	MAR	009	031	For he taught his disciples, and said to them, The Son of man is about to be delivered up into the hands of men, and they will put him to death; and when he hath been put to death, after three days he will rise again.
041	MAR	009	032	But they understood not what he said, and were afraid to ask him.
041	MAR	009	033	And they came to Capernaum; and having come into the house, he asked them, About what were ye disputing on the road?
041	MAR	009	034	But they were silent; for on the road they had been disputing with one another, who was greatest.
041	MAR	009	035	And sitting down, he called the twelve, and saith to them, If any one desire to be first, he will be last of all, and servant of all.
041	MAR	009	036	And he took a child, and placed him in the midst of them, and taking him in his arms, he said to them,
041	MAR	009	037	Whoever receiveth one of these children in my name, receiveth me; and whoever receiveth me, receiveth not me, but him that sent me.
041	MAR	009	038	John said to him, Teacher, we saw one casting out demons in thy name who followeth not us; and we forbade him, because he did not follow us.
041	MAR	009	039	But Jesus said, Forbid him not. For no one, who shall do a miracle in my name, can readily speak evil of me.
041	MAR	009	040	For he that is not against us is for us.
041	MAR	009	041	For whoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name, because ye belong to Christ, truly do I say to you, he will not lose his reward.
041	MAR	009	042	And whoever shall cause one of these little ones that believe to fall away, it would be better for him to have a great millstone hung round his neck, and be cast into the sea.
041	MAR	009	043	And if thy hand cause thee to fall away, cut it off. It is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having the two hands to go away into hell, into the fire that is unquenchable.
041	MAR	009	045	And if thy foot is causing thee to fall away, cut it off; it is better for thee to enter into life lame, than having the two feet to be cast into hell.
041	MAR	009	047	And if thine eye is causing thee to fall away, pluck it out; it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell,
041	MAR	009	048	where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.
041	MAR	009	049	For every one will be salted with fire.
041	MAR	009	050	Salt is good; but if the salt have lost its saltness, wherewith will ye season it? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with one another.
041	MAR	010	001	And departing thence, he cometh into the borders of Judaea, and to the other side of the Jordan; and multitudes again come together to him; and, as he was wont, he again taught them.
041	MAR	010	002	And the Pharisees came to him, and asked him whether it was lawful for a man to put away his wife, trying him.
041	MAR	010	003	And he answering said to them, What did Moses command you?
041	MAR	010	004	And they said, Moses permitted to write a bill of divorcement, and to put her away.
041	MAR	010	005	And Jesus said to them, On account of your hardness of heart he wrote you this command.
041	MAR	010	006	But, from the beginning of the creation, [[God]] made them male and female.
041	MAR	010	007	“For this cause shall a man leave his father and his mother;
041	MAR	010	008	and the two shall become one flesh.” So they are no longer two, but one flesh.
041	MAR	010	009	What therefore God joined together, let not man put asunder.
041	MAR	010	010	And in the house his disciples asked him again about this matter.
041	MAR	010	011	And he saith to them, Whoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery against her.
041	MAR	010	012	And if she put away her husband, and be married to another, she committeth adultery.
041	MAR	010	013	And they brought children to him, that he might touch them; and the disciples rebuked those that brought them.
041	MAR	010	014	But Jesus seeing it was much displeased, and said to them, Suffer the children to come to me; forbid them not; for to such belongeth the kingdom of God.
041	MAR	010	015	Truly do I say to you, Whoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a child, will not enter therein.
041	MAR	010	016	And he took them in his arms, and blessed them, laying his hands upon them.
041	MAR	010	017	And as he was going out into the way, a certain one running up and kneeling to him, asked him, Good teacher, what shall I do that I may inherit everlasting life?
041	MAR	010	018	And Jesus said to him, Why dost thou call me good? None is good but one, that is, God.
041	MAR	010	019	Thou knowest the commandments, “Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honor thy father and thy mother.”
041	MAR	010	020	And he said to him, Teacher, all these have I kept from my youth.
041	MAR	010	021	And Jesus looking at him, loved him, and said to him, One thing thou lackest; go, sell whatever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.
041	MAR	010	022	But his countenance fell at that saying, and he went away sorrowful; for he had great possessions.
041	MAR	010	023	And Jesus, looking round, saith to his disciples, How hardly shall they who have riches enter the kingdom t of God!
041	MAR	010	024	And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus answering again saith to them, Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God!
041	MAR	010	025	It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.
041	MAR	010	026	And they were beyond measure astonished, saying among themselves, Who then can be saved?
041	MAR	010	027	Jesus looking upon them saith, With men it is impossible, but not with God; for all things are possible with God.
041	MAR	010	028	Peter began to say to him, Lo! we left all, and have followed thee.
041	MAR	010	029	Jesus said, Truly do I say to you, There is no one who hath left house, or brothers, or sisters, or mother, or father, or children, or lands, for the sake of me and of the glad tidings,
041	MAR	010	030	who will not receive a hundredfold in the time that now is, houses, and brothers, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions, and in the world to come everlasting life.
041	MAR	010	031	But many who are first will be last; and the last first.
041	MAR	010	032	And they were on the road, going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus was leading the way; and they were amazed, and they that followed were afraid. And again taking the twelve aside, he began to tell them what things were about to befall him:
041	MAR	010	033	Lo! we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man will be delivered up to the chief priests and to the scribes; and they will condemn him to death, and deliver him up to the gentiles;
041	MAR	010	034	and they will mock him, and spit upon him, and scourge him, and put him to death; and after three days he will rise again.
041	MAR	010	035	And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come to him, saying to him, Teacher, we would that thou shouldst do for us whatever we shall ask thee.
041	MAR	010	036	And he said to them, What would ye that I should do for you?
041	MAR	010	037	And they said to him, Grant to us that we may sit, one on thy right hand and one on thy left, in thy glory.
041	MAR	010	038	But Jesus said to them, Ye know not what ye ask. Can ye drink the cup that I drink, or be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?
041	MAR	010	039	And they said to him, We can. And Jesus said to them, Ye will drink the cup that I drink, and ye will be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with;
041	MAR	010	040	but to sit on my right hand or on my left is not mine to give, but it will be given to those for whom it hath been prepared.
041	MAR	010	041	And the ten hearing it began to be much displeased with James and John.
041	MAR	010	042	And Jesus, calling them to him, saith to them, Ye know that they who are accounted to rule over the nations lord it over them, and their great men exercise a strict authority over them.
041	MAR	010	043	But it is not so among you; but whoever desireth to become great among you, will be your minister;
041	MAR	010	044	and whoever of you desireth to become first, will be servant of all;
041	MAR	010	045	for even the Son of man came not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life a ransom for many.
041	MAR	010	046	And they come to Jericho; and as he was going out of Jericho with his disciples and a great multitude, the son of Timaeus, Bartimaeus, a blind beggar, was sitting by the wayside.
041	MAR	010	047	And hearing that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to cry out and say, Son of David, Jesus, have pity on me!
041	MAR	010	048	And many sharply bade him be silent; but he cried out the more, Son of David, have pity on me!
041	MAR	010	049	And Jesus stopped, and said, Call him. And they call the blind man, saying to him, Be of good courage, rise, he calleth thee.
041	MAR	010	050	And throwing off his garment, he leaped up, and came to Jesus.
041	MAR	010	051	And Jesus answering said to him, What dost thou wish me to do for thee? The blind man said to him, My master, to restore my sight.
041	MAR	010	052	And Jesus said to him, Go; thy faith hath saved thee. And he immediately received his sight, and followed him on the road.
041	MAR	011	001	And when they were drawing near to Jerusalem and to Bethany, at the Mount of Olives, he sendeth forth two of his disciples,
041	MAR	011	002	and saith to them, Go to the village over against you; and immediately on entering it ye will find a colt tied, on which no man hath yet sat; loose and bring it.
041	MAR	011	003	And if any one say to you, Why do ye this? say, The Lord hath need of it, and will immediately send it back hither.
041	MAR	011	004	And they went, and found the colt tied by the door without, on the street; and they loose it.
041	MAR	011	005	And some of those who were standing there said to them, What are ye about, loosing the colt?
041	MAR	011	006	And they said to them as Jesus had commanded; and they let them go.
041	MAR	011	007	And they bring the colt to Jesus, and put their garments on it; and he sat upon it.
041	MAR	011	008	And many spread their garments on the road; and others boughs, having cut them from the fields.
041	MAR	011	009	And they that went before, and they that followed, cried, Hosanna! Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord!
041	MAR	011	010	Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David! Hosanna in the highest heavens!
041	MAR	011	011	And he entered Jerusalem, and the temple; and having looked round on all things, the evening being now come, he went out to Bethany, with the twelve.
041	MAR	011	012	And on the morrow, when they had come from Bethany, he was hungry;
041	MAR	011	013	and seeing a fig-tree afar off having leaves, he went to see whether he might find anything on it; and on coming to it he found nothing but leaves; for the season of figs had not come.
041	MAR	011	014	And he answering said to it, Let no one eat fruit from thee henceforth for ever. And his disciples heard him.
041	MAR	011	015	And they come to Jerusalem. And he went into the temple, and began to cast out those who sold and bought in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money-changers, and the seats of those who sold the doves;
041	MAR	011	016	and he suffered no one to carry any vessel through the temple.
041	MAR	011	017	And he taught, and said to them, Is it not written, “My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations? but ye have made it a den of robbers.”
041	MAR	011	018	And the chief priests and the scribes heard it, and sought how they might destroy him; for they feared him; because all the multitude was astonished at his teaching.
041	MAR	011	019	And when it became late, he went out of the city.
041	MAR	011	020	And in the morning, as they were passing by, they saw the fig-tree withered from the roots.
041	MAR	011	021	And Peter remembered and said to him, Rabbi, see! the fig-tree which thou didst curse is withered away.
041	MAR	011	022	And Jesus answering saith to them, Have faith in God.
041	MAR	011	023	Truly do I say to you, that whoever shall say to this mountain, Be thou taken up, and cast into the sea, and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that what he saith will come to pass, he shall have it.
041	MAR	011	024	Therefore I say to you, All things whatever ye pray for and ask, believe that ye have obtained, and ye shall have them.
041	MAR	011	025	And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have aught against any one, that your Father who is in heaven may also forgive you your trespasses.
041	MAR	011	027	And they come again to Jerusalem. And as he was walking in the temple, there come to him the chief priests and the scribes and the elders;
041	MAR	011	028	and they said to him, By what authority doest thou these things? or who gave thee this authority to do these things?
041	MAR	011	029	And Jesus said to them, I will ask you one question; and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.
041	MAR	011	030	The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or from men? Answer me.
041	MAR	011	031	And they reasoned among themselves, saying, If we say, From heaven, he will say, Why then did ye not believe him?
041	MAR	011	032	But shall we say, From men? They feared the people; for all regarded John as truly a prophet.
041	MAR	011	033	And they answered and said to Jesus, We do not know. And Jesus saith to them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.
041	MAR	012	001	And he began to speak to them in parables: A man planted a vineyard, and set a hedge about it, and dug a wine-vat, and built a tower; and let it out to husbandmen, and went abroad.
041	MAR	012	002	And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruits of the vineyard.
041	MAR	012	003	And they took him, and beat him, and sent him away empty-handed.
041	MAR	012	004	And again he sent to them another servant; and him they wounded in the head, and treated shamefully.
041	MAR	012	005	And he sent another; and him they killed; and many others, beating some, and killing some.
041	MAR	012	006	Still he had one beloved son; he sent him last to them, saying, They will respect my son.
041	MAR	012	007	But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.
041	MAR	012	008	And they took him and killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard.
041	MAR	012	009	What will the lord of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard to others.
041	MAR	012	010	And have ye not read this scripture: “The stone which the builders rejected, the same hath become the cornerstone;
041	MAR	012	011	from the Lord did this come, and it is marvelous in our eyes”?
041	MAR	012	012	And they sought to seize him, but feared the multitude; for they knew that he spoke the parable against them. And they left him, and went away.
041	MAR	012	013	And they send to him some of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, to ensnare him in speech.
041	MAR	012	014	And they come and say to him, Teacher, we know that thou art true, and carest for no one; for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth. Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?
041	MAR	012	015	Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, seeing their hypocrisy, said to them, Why are ye trying me? Bring me a denary, that I may see it.
041	MAR	012	016	And they brought one. And he saith to them, Whose is this image and inscription? And they said to him, Caesar's.
041	MAR	012	017	And Jesus said to them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's. And they marveled at him exceedingly.
041	MAR	012	018	Then come to him Sadducees, who say that there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying,
041	MAR	012	019	Teacher, Moses wrote to us, “If a man's brother die, and leave a wife and no child, his brother shall take his wife, and raise up seed to his brother.”
041	MAR	012	020	There were seven brothers; and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed.
041	MAR	012	021	And the second took her and died, leaving no seed; and the third likewise.
041	MAR	012	022	And the seven left no seed. Last of all, the woman also died.
041	MAR	012	023	In the resurrection, when they have risen, of which of them will she be wife? for the seven had her for a wife.
041	MAR	012	024	Jesus said to them, Do ye not err on this account, that ye know not the Scriptures, nor the power of God?
041	MAR	012	025	For when they have risen from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels in heaven.
041	MAR	012	026	And concerning the dead, that they are raised, have ye not read in the book of Moses, at the Bush, how God spoke to him, saying, “I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob”?
041	MAR	012	027	He is not the God of the dead, but of the living. Ye err greatly.
041	MAR	012	028	And one of the scribes came up, having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which commandment is first of all?
041	MAR	012	029	Jesus answered, The first is, “Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord;
041	MAR	012	030	and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength.”
041	MAR	012	031	The second is this: “Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.” There is no other commandment greater than these.
041	MAR	012	032	And the scribe said to him, In truth, Teacher, thou hast well said, that He is one, and that there is no other but he;
041	MAR	012	033	and to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the strength, and to love one's neighbor as one's self, is more than all the whole burnt-offerings and the sacrifices.
041	MAR	012	034	And Jesus, perceiving that he answered wisely, said to him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And after this no one dared to question him.
041	MAR	012	035	And Jesus answered and said, while he was teaching in the temple, How is it that the scribes say, that the Christ is David's son?
041	MAR	012	036	David himself said in the Holy Spirit, “The Lord said to my lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool.”
041	MAR	012	037	David himself calleth him lord; and how can he be his son? And the great multitude heard him gladly.
041	MAR	012	038	And he said in his teaching, Beware of the scribes, who like to walk about in long robes, and love salutations in the markets,
041	MAR	012	039	and the chief seats in the synagogues, and the first places at feasts;
041	MAR	012	040	who devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayers. These will receive a far greater condemnation.
041	MAR	012	041	And he sat over against the treasury, and was beholding how the people cast money into the treasury. And many that were rich were casting in much.
041	MAR	012	042	And a certain poor widow came and threw in two mites, which make a farthing.
041	MAR	012	043	And he called to him his disciples, and said to them, Truly do I say to you, that this poor widow hath cast in more than all those who are casting into the treasury.
041	MAR	012	044	For they all threw in of their abundance; but she out of her penury threw in all that she had, her whole living.
041	MAR	013	001	And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples saith to him, Teacher, see! what stones, and what buildings!
041	MAR	013	002	And Jesus said to him, Seest thou these great buildings? There will not be left one stone upon another, that will not be thrown down.
041	MAR	013	003	And as he was sitting on the Mount of Olives, over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately,
041	MAR	013	004	Tell us, when will these things be? and what will be the sign when all these things are about to be accomplished?
041	MAR	013	005	And Jesus began to say to them, See that no one deceive you.
041	MAR	013	006	Many will come in my name, saying, I am He; and will deceive many.
041	MAR	013	007	And when ye hear of wars, and rumors of wars, be not troubled; they must come to pass; but not yet is the end.
041	MAR	013	008	For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; there will be earthquakes in divers places; there will be famines. These things are the beginning of travail-pains.
041	MAR	013	009	But do ye take heed to yourselves; they will deliver you up to councils, and ye will be taken into synagogues and beaten; and ye will be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony to them.
041	MAR	013	010	And the glad tidings must first be published to all the nations.
041	MAR	013	011	And when they lead you away to deliver you up, be not anxious beforehand as to what ye shall speak; but whatever shall be given you in that hour, that speak; for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Spirit.
041	MAR	013	012	And brother will deliver up brother to death, and the father his child; and children will rise up against parents, and put them to death.
041	MAR	013	013	And ye will be hated by all on account of my name. But he that endureth to the end will be saved.
041	MAR	013	014	But when ye see the abomination of desolation standing where it ought not, —let him that readeth understand, —then let those who are in Judaea flee to the mountains;
041	MAR	013	015	let not him that is on the house-top go down, nor enter, to take anything out of his house;
041	MAR	013	016	and let not him that is in the field turn back to take his garment.
041	MAR	013	017	And woe to the women with child, and to those with children at the breast, in those days!
041	MAR	013	018	And pray that it may not be in winter.
041	MAR	013	019	For those days will be a time of distress, such as hath not been from the beginning of the creation which God created until now, nor shall be.
041	MAR	013	020	And if the Lord had not shortened the days, no flesh would have been saved; but for the sake of the chosen whom he chose, he shortened the days.
041	MAR	013	021	And then if any one shall say to you, See! here is the Christ; see! there; believe him not.
041	MAR	013	022	For false Christs and false prophets will rise up, and will do signs and wonders, to lead astray, if possible, the chosen.
041	MAR	013	023	But do ye take heed! I have told you all beforehand.
041	MAR	013	024	But in those days, after that distress, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give her light;
041	MAR	013	025	and the stars will be falling from heaven, and the powers that are in the heavens will be shaken.
041	MAR	013	026	And then will they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory.
041	MAR	013	027	And then will he send forth the angels, and will gather the chosen ones from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven.
041	MAR	013	028	And from the fig-tree learn its parable. When its branch hath now become tender, and putteth forth its leaves, ye know that summer is near.
041	MAR	013	029	So also, when ye see these things coming to pass, know ye that he is near, at the doors.
041	MAR	013	030	Truly do I say to you, that this generation will not pass away, till all these things take place.
041	MAR	013	031	Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.
041	MAR	013	032	But that day or hour knoweth no one, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but the Father.
041	MAR	013	033	Take heed, watch; for ye know not when the time is.
041	MAR	013	034	As a man going abroad, having left his house and given authority to his servants, to each one his work, also commanded the porter to watch,
041	MAR	013	035	so also watch ye; for ye know not when the master of the house is coming, whether at evening, or at midnight, or at the cock-crowing, or in the morning;
041	MAR	013	036	lest coming suddenly, he find you sleeping.
041	MAR	013	037	And what I say to you, I say to all: Watch.
041	MAR	014	001	And two days after was the passover, and the feast of unleavened bread; and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might seize him by craft, and put him to death.
041	MAR	014	002	For they said, Not at the feast, lest there be an uproar among the people.
041	MAR	014	003	And when he was at Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, as he was reclining at table, there came a woman having an alabaster bottle of ointment of pure spikenard, very precious; and breaking the bottle, she poured it on his head.
041	MAR	014	004	And there were some that were much displeased, [[and said]] among themselves, Why is this waste of the ointment made?
041	MAR	014	005	For this ointment might have been sold for more than three hundred denaries, and given to the poor. And they chid her harshly.
041	MAR	014	006	But Jesus said, Let her alone; why do ye trouble her? A good deed hath she done for me.
041	MAR	014	007	For the poor ye have always with you, and whenever ye will, ye can do good to them; but me ye have not always.
041	MAR	014	008	She hath done what she could; she hath anointed my body beforehand for its burial.
041	MAR	014	009	And truly do I say to you, Wherever the glad tidings shall be published throughout the whole world, this too which she hath done will be told for a memorial of her.
041	MAR	014	010	And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went to the chief priests, that he might deliver him up to them.
041	MAR	014	011	And they when they heard it were glad, and promised to give him money. And he sought a good opportunity to deliver him up.
041	MAR	014	012	And on the first day of the feast of unleavened bread, when they used to kill the passover, his disciples say to him, Where wilt thou that we go and make ready for thee to eat the passover?
041	MAR	014	013	And he sendeth forth two of his disciples, and saith to them, Go into the city, and there will meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water; follow him;
041	MAR	014	014	and wherever he goeth in, say to the master of the house, The Teacher saith, Where is my guest-chamber, where I may eat the passover with my disciples?
041	MAR	014	015	And he will show you a large upper room furnished and prepared; and there make ready for us.
041	MAR	014	016	And the disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found as he had told them; and they made ready the passover.
041	MAR	014	017	And when it was evening, he cometh with the twelve.
041	MAR	014	018	And as they were reclining at table and eating, Jesus said, Truly do I say to you, that one of you will betray me, —one that is eating with me.
041	MAR	014	019	They began to be sorrowful, and to say to him one by one, Is it I?
041	MAR	014	020	And he said to them, It is one of the twelve, one that is dipping with me in the dish.
041	MAR	014	021	For the Son of man indeed goeth away, as it hath been written concerning him; but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! Well were it for that man if he had not been born.
041	MAR	014	022	And as they were eating, he took a loaf, and blessed, and broke it, and gave it to them, and said, Take; this is my body.
041	MAR	014	023	And he took a cup, and having given thanks, gave it to them; and they all drank of it.
041	MAR	014	024	And he said to them, This is my blood of the covenant, which is shed for many.
041	MAR	014	025	Truly do I say to you, I shall not drink hereafter of the fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.
041	MAR	014	026	And having sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
041	MAR	014	027	And Jesus saith to them, Ye will all fall away from me; for it is written, “I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.”
041	MAR	014	028	But after I have risen, I will go before you into Galilee.
041	MAR	014	029	But Peter said to him, Even if all shall fall away, yet will not I.
041	MAR	014	030	And Jesus saith to him, Truly do I say to thee, that even thou, to-day, on this night, before a cock crow twice, wilt thrice deny me.
041	MAR	014	031	But he spoke the more vehemently: If I must die with thee, I will not deny thee. And so also said they all.
041	MAR	014	032	And they come to a place called Gethsemane; and he saith to his disciples, Sit here, while I pray.
041	MAR	014	033	And he taketh with him Peter and James and John; and began to be in great consternation and anguish.
041	MAR	014	034	And he saith to them, My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death; remain here and watch.
041	MAR	014	035	And going on a little farther, he fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it was possible, the hour might pass from him.
041	MAR	014	036	And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible to thee! take away this cup from me. But not what I will, but what thou wilt.
041	MAR	014	037	And he cometh and findeth them sleeping; and he saith to Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? Couldst not thou watch one hour?
041	MAR	014	038	Watch, and pray that ye enter not into temptation; the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.
041	MAR	014	039	And again he went away and prayed, saying the same words.
041	MAR	014	040	And returning, he found them again sleeping, for their eyes were heavy; and they knew not what to answer him.
041	MAR	014	041	And he cometh the third time, and saith to them, Sleep on, and take your rest! It is enough! the hour is come: lo! the Son of man is delivered up into the hands of sinners.
041	MAR	014	042	Rise, let us be going; lo! he that delivereth me up is at hand.
041	MAR	014	043	And immediately, while he was yet speaking, cometh Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, and with him a multitude with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the scribes and elders.
041	MAR	014	044	And his betrayer had given them a signal, saying, Whomever I shall kiss, he is the man; seize him, and lead him away securely.
041	MAR	014	045	And on coming he immediately went up to him, and said, Rabbi! and kissed him.
041	MAR	014	046	And they laid hands on him and seized him.
041	MAR	014	047	And one of those who stood by drew his sword, and smote the servant of the high-priest, and cut off his ear.
041	MAR	014	048	And Jesus answering said to them, Ye have come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs, to take me.
041	MAR	014	049	I was daily with you in the temple, teaching, and ye did not lay hands on me; but [[thus it is]], that the Scriptures may be fulfilled.
041	MAR	014	050	And all forsook him and fled.
041	MAR	014	051	And there followed him a certain young man having a linen cloth wrapped round his naked body; and they laid hold of him.
041	MAR	014	052	And he left the linen cloth behind, and fled naked.
041	MAR	014	053	And they led Jesus away to the high-priest; and all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes come together.
041	MAR	014	054	And Peter followed him afar off, even into the court of the palace of the high-priest, and was sitting with the officers, and warming himself at the fire.
041	MAR	014	055	And the chief priests and the whole council sought for testimony against Jesus in order to put him to death; and they found none.
041	MAR	014	056	For many bore false witness against him, but their testimonies did not agree together.
041	MAR	014	057	And some stood up and bore false witness against him, saying,
041	MAR	014	058	We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will build another not made with hands.
041	MAR	014	059	And not even so did their testimony agree.
041	MAR	014	060	And the high-priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying, Dost thou make no answer to what these men testify against thee?
041	MAR	014	061	But he was silent, and answered nothing. Again the high-priest asked him, and saith to him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?
041	MAR	014	062	And Jesus said, I am; and ye will see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of heaven.
041	MAR	014	063	Then the high-priest rent his garments, and said, What further need have we of witnesses?
041	MAR	014	064	Ye have heard the blasphemy; what think ye? And they all condemned him as deserving the punishment of death.
041	MAR	014	065	And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face and buffet him, and say to him, Prophesy! And the officers, with blows, took him in charge.
041	MAR	014	066	And as Peter was below in the court, there cometh one of the maid-servants of the high-priest;
041	MAR	014	067	and seeing Peter warming himself, she looked at him and said, Thou too wast with the Nazarene, Jesus.
041	MAR	014	068	But he denied, saying, I do not know nor understand what thou sayest. And he went out into the fore-court; and a cock crew.
041	MAR	014	069	And the maid-servant, seeing him, began again to say to those who were standing by, This is one of them.
041	MAR	014	070	And he denied it again. And shortly after, those who were standing by said again to Peter, Surely thou art one of them; for thou art a Galilaean.
041	MAR	014	071	But he began to curse and to swear, saying, I know not this man of whom ye speak.
041	MAR	014	072	And immediately a cock crew a second time. And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus had said to him, Before a cock crows twice, thou wilt thrice deny me. And when he thought thereon, he wept.
041	MAR	015	001	And as soon as it was morning, the chief priests, having held a consultation with the elders and the scribes, and the whole council, bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him up to Pilate.
041	MAR	015	002	And Pilate asked him, Art thou the king of the Jews? And he answering saith to him, I am.
041	MAR	015	003	And the chief priests brought many charges against him.
041	MAR	015	004	And Pilate asked him again, Dost thou make no answer? See what things they are testifying against thee!
041	MAR	015	005	But Jesus made no further answer; so that Pilate marveled.
041	MAR	015	006	Now at the feast he was wont to release to them one prisoner, whom they might ask.
041	MAR	015	007	And there was one named Barabbas, who lay bound with insurgents who had committed murder in the insurrection.
041	MAR	015	008	And the multitude, coming up, began to ask him to do as he had been wont to do for them.
041	MAR	015	009	And Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release to you the king of the Jews?
041	MAR	015	010	For he knew that for envy the chief priests had delivered him up.
041	MAR	015	011	But the chief priests stirred up the multitude, that he should rather release to them Barabbas.
041	MAR	015	012	And Pilate answering again said to them, What then would ye have me do with him whom ye call the king of the Jews?
041	MAR	015	013	And they cried out again, Crucify him!
041	MAR	015	014	Then Pilate said to them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the more, Crucify him!
041	MAR	015	015	And Pilate, wishing to satisfy the multitude, released to them Barabbas; and, when he had scourged Jesus, delivered him up to be crucified.
041	MAR	015	016	And the soldiers led him away into the court, which is the Praetorium; and they call together the whole band.
041	MAR	015	017	And they clothe him with purple, and having platted a crown of thorns, they put it on him.
041	MAR	015	018	And they began to salute him: Hail, king of the Jews!
041	MAR	015	019	And they struck him on the head with a reed, and spit upon him, and kneeling down, did him homage.
041	MAR	015	020	And after they had made sport of him, they stripped him of the purple robe, and put his own garments on him. And they lead him out to crucify him.
041	MAR	015	021	And they compel one Simon a Cyrenaean, who was passing by, coming from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to carry his cross.
041	MAR	015	022	And they bring him to the place Golgotha; which is, when interpreted, Place of a Skull.
041	MAR	015	023	And they gave him wine mingled with myrrh; but he did not take it.
041	MAR	015	024	And they crucify him, and divide his garments, casting lots for them, what each should take.
041	MAR	015	025	And it was the third hour when they crucified him.
041	MAR	015	026	And on the cross the inscription of the charge against him was written: “The king of the Jews.”
041	MAR	015	027	And with him they crucify two robbers; one on his right hand, and one on his left.
041	MAR	015	029	And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ha! thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it up in three days,
041	MAR	015	030	save thyself, and come down from the cross.
041	MAR	015	031	In like manner also the chief priests, with the scribes, making sport among themselves, said, He saved others, cannot he save himself?
041	MAR	015	032	Let the Christ, the king of Israel, come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him were reviling him.
041	MAR	015	033	And when the sixth hour had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.
041	MAR	015	034	And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani? which is, when interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?
041	MAR	015	035	And some of those who stood by, when they heard it, said, See! he is calling for Elijah.
041	MAR	015	036	And one ran and filled a sponge with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink, saying, Hold! Let us see whether Elijah will come to take him down.
041	MAR	015	037	And Jesus, having uttered a loud cry, expired.
041	MAR	015	038	And the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom.
041	MAR	015	039	And the centurion who stood over against him, seeing that he so expired, said, Truly this man was the Son of God.
041	MAR	015	040	There were also women looking on from a distance; among whom was Mary the Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;
041	MAR	015	041	who, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and rendered him their services; and many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem.
041	MAR	015	042	And evening having now come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,
041	MAR	015	043	Joseph of Arimathaea, an honorable councilor, who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God, came, and boldly went in to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus.
041	MAR	015	044	And Pilate wondered that he was already dead; and calling to him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been long dead.
041	MAR	015	045	And having been informed by the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.
041	MAR	015	046	And having bought fine linen, he took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a tomb which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone to the door of the tomb.
041	MAR	015	047	And Mary the Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was laid.
041	MAR	016	001	And when the sabbath was past, Mary the Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, bought spices, that they might come and anoint him.
041	MAR	016	002	And very early on the first day of the week, they came to the tomb at the rising of the sun.
041	MAR	016	003	And they said to one another, Who will roll away for us the stone from the door of the tomb?
041	MAR	016	004	And looking up they see that the stone had been rolled back; for it was very large.
041	MAR	016	005	And they entered the tomb, and saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted.
041	MAR	016	006	But he saith to them, Be not affrighted; ye seek Jesus the Nazarene who was crucified; he hath risen; he is not here; behold the place where they laid him.
041	MAR	016	007	But go, tell his disciples and Peter, that he is going before you into Galilee; there ye will see him, as he said to you.
041	MAR	016	008	And they went out, and fled from the tomb; for trembling and amazement had seized them, and they said nothing to any one; for they were terrified.
041	MAR	016	009	(note: The most reliable and earliest manuscripts do not include Mark 16:9-20.) (The remaining twelve verses, according to Tischendorf and others, made originally no part of Mark's Gospel. As the passage was added very early, however, since it is referred to by Irenaeus in the latter part of the second century, it is here given, as an appendix.) [[And having risen early, on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary the Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven demons.
041	MAR	016	010	She went and reported it to those who had been with him, who were mourning and weeping.
041	MAR	016	011	And they, when they heard that he was alive, and had been seen by her, did not believe.
041	MAR	016	012	After this, he manifested himself in another form to two of them as they walked, going into the country.
041	MAR	016	013	And they went and reported it to the rest; and even them they did not believe.
041	MAR	016	014	Afterward he manifested himself to the eleven themselves, as they were reclining at table, and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they did not believe those who had seen him after he had risen.
041	MAR	016	015	And he said to them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the glad tidings to the whole creation.
041	MAR	016	016	He that believeth and is baptized will be saved; but he that doth not believe will be condemned.
041	MAR	016	017	And these signs will accompany believers: In my name they will cast out demons; they will speak with new tongues;
041	MAR	016	018	they will take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it will not hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick, and they will recover.
041	MAR	016	019	So then, the Lord, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven, and sat down on the right hand of God;
041	MAR	016	020	and they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word by the signs which followed it.]]

# BOOK	042	LUK	Luke	Luke
042	LUK	001	001	Inasmuch as many have undertaken to arrange a narrative of those things which are fully believed among us,
042	LUK	001	002	even as they were delivered to us by those who were eye-witnesses from the beginning and became ministers of the word,
042	LUK	001	003	it seemed good to me also, having accurately traced up all things from the first, to write to thee a connected account, most excellent Theophilus,
042	LUK	001	004	that thou mightst know the exact truth with regard to those things in which thou wast instructed.
042	LUK	001	005	There was in the days of Herod, king of Judaea, a certain priest named Zachariah, of the course of Abijah; and he had a wife of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.
042	LUK	001	006	And they were both righteous in the sight of God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.
042	LUK	001	007	And they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they were both far advanced in years.
042	LUK	001	008	And it came to pass, that, while he was serving as priest before God in the order of his course,
042	LUK	001	009	according to the custom of the priesthood the lot fell to him to go into the temple of the Lord and burn the incense.
042	LUK	001	010	And the whole multitude of the people was praying without at the time of the incense.
042	LUK	001	011	And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord, standing on the right of the altar of incense.
042	LUK	001	012	And Zachariah was troubled at the sight, and fear fell upon him.
042	LUK	001	013	But the angel said to him, Fear not, Zachariah; for thy prayer was heard, and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son; and thou shalt call his name John.
042	LUK	001	014	And thou wilt have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice for his birth.
042	LUK	001	015	For he will be great in the sight of the Lord; and will drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit from his very birth.
042	LUK	001	016	And many of the sons of Israel will he turn to the Lord their God.
042	LUK	001	017	And he will go before his face in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of fathers to children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous, to make ready for the Lord a prepared people.
042	LUK	001	018	And Zachariah said to the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife is far advanced in years.
042	LUK	001	019	And the angel answering said to him, I am Gabriel, who stand in the presence of God; and I was sent to speak to thee, and to tell thee these glad tidings.
042	LUK	001	020	And lo! thou shalt be silent, and not able to speak, until the day when these things shall come to pass, because thou didst not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their season.
042	LUK	001	021	And the people were looking for Zachariah, and wondering that he remained so long in the temple.
042	LUK	001	022	And on coming out, he was not able to speak to them; and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple; and he was beckoning to them, and remained speechless.
042	LUK	001	023	And it came to pass, when the days of his ministration were completed, that he returned to his house.
042	LUK	001	024	And after those days his wife Elizabeth conceived, and hid herself five months, saying,
042	LUK	001	025	Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on me to take away my reproach among men.
042	LUK	001	026	And in her sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee, called Nazareth,
042	LUK	001	027	to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary.
042	LUK	001	028	And the angel came in to her and said, Hail, thou that art highly favored! the Lord is with thee.
042	LUK	001	029	And she was troubled at the words, and was considering what this salutation could mean.
042	LUK	001	030	And the angel said to her, Fear not, Mary; for thou hast found favor with God.
042	LUK	001	031	And lo! thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and hear a son, and shalt call his name Jesus.
042	LUK	001	032	He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give to him the throne of David his father;
042	LUK	001	033	and he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.
042	LUK	001	034	Then said Mary to the angel, How shall this be, since I know not a man?
042	LUK	001	035	And the angel answering said to her, The Holy Spirit will come upon thee, and the power of the Most High will overshadow thee; wherefore the holy one that is to be born will be called the Son of God.
042	LUK	001	036	And lo! Elizabeth, thy kinswoman, she also hath conceived a son in her old age; and this is the sixth month with her who is called barren.
042	LUK	001	037	For nothing will be impossible with God.
042	LUK	001	038	And Mary said, Lo, the handmaid of the Lord! May it be to me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.
042	LUK	001	039	And Mary arose and went in those days into the hill-country with haste, into a city of Judah.
042	LUK	001	040	And she entered the house of Zachariah, and saluted Elizabeth.
042	LUK	001	041	And it came to pass, when Elizabeth heard the salutation of Mary, that the babe leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit,
042	LUK	001	042	and cried out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed art thou among women; and blessed is the fruit of thy womb!
042	LUK	001	043	And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?
042	LUK	001	044	For lo! as soon as the voice of thy salutation came to my ears, the babe leaped in my womb in exultation.
042	LUK	001	045	And blessed is she who hath believed that there will be an accomplishment of those things which were told her from the Lord.
042	LUK	001	046	And Mary said, My soul magnifieth the Lord,
042	LUK	001	047	and my spirit hath exulted in God my Saviour;
042	LUK	001	048	for he hath looked upon the low estate of his handmaiden. For lo! from this time all generations will call me blessed;
042	LUK	001	049	for the Mighty One hath done great things for me; and holy is his name;
042	LUK	001	050	and his mercy is from generation to generation on them that fear him.
042	LUK	001	051	He hath wrought mightily with his arm; he hath scattered the proud in the device of their heart.
042	LUK	001	052	He hath cast down princes from thrones, and exalted men of low degree.
042	LUK	001	053	The hungry he hath filled with good things, and the rich he hath sent away empty.
042	LUK	001	054	He hath given help to Israel his servant, in remembrance of his mercy
042	LUK	001	055	toward Abraham and his offspring for ever, as he spoke to our fathers.
042	LUK	001	056	And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her own house.
042	LUK	001	057	Now Elizabeth's full time came that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son.
042	LUK	001	058	And her neighbors and her kinsfolk heard that the Lord had showed great mercy toward her; and they rejoiced with her.
042	LUK	001	059	And it came to pass that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they were about to call him Zachariah, after the name of his father.
042	LUK	001	060	And his mother answering said, Not so; but he shall be called John.
042	LUK	001	061	And they said to her, There is no one of thy kindred that is called by this name.
042	LUK	001	062	And they made signs to his father, how he would have him named.
042	LUK	001	063	And he asked for a writing-tablet, and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they all marveled.
042	LUK	001	064	And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue was loosed; and he spoke, blessing God.
042	LUK	001	065	And fear came on all that dwelt around them; and all these things were talked of throughout the whole of the hill-country of Judaea.
042	LUK	001	066	And all that heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, What then will this child be? For the hand of the Lord was with him.
042	LUK	001	067	And Zachariah his father was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying,
042	LUK	001	068	Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel! for he hath visited and redeemed his people,
042	LUK	001	069	and hath raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of David his servant, —
042	LUK	001	070	as he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets of old,
042	LUK	001	071	salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us,
042	LUK	001	072	to accomplish his mercy toward our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant,
042	LUK	001	073	the oath which he swore to Abraham our father,
042	LUK	001	074	to grant to us, that being delivered from the hand of our enemies, we might worship him without fear,
042	LUK	001	075	in holiness and righteousness before him, all our days.
042	LUK	001	076	And thou, child, shalt be called a prophet of the Most High; for thou shalt go in advance before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways,
042	LUK	001	077	to give knowledge of salvation to his people in the remission of their sins
042	LUK	001	078	through the tender mercy of our God, whereby the day-spring from on high hath visited us,
042	LUK	001	079	to give light to those sitting in darkness and the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.
042	LUK	001	080	And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit; and was in the deserts till the day of his manifestation to Israel.
042	LUK	002	001	And it came to pass in those days that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be registered.
042	LUK	002	002	(This registering was the first made while Quirinius was governor of Syria.)
042	LUK	002	003	And all went to be registered, each to his own city.
042	LUK	002	004	And Joseph also went up from Galilee out of the city of Nazareth into Judaea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David,
042	LUK	002	005	to be registered with Mary who had been betrothed to him, who was with child.
042	LUK	002	006	And it came to pass, while they were there, that the days for her delivery were completed.
042	LUK	002	007	And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swathing-clothes, and laid him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.
042	LUK	002	008	And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, and keeping watch over their flock by night.
042	LUK	002	009	And an angel of the Lord came to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them; and they were in great fear.
042	LUK	002	010	And the angel said to them, Fear not; for lo! I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to the whole people;
042	LUK	002	011	for to you hath been born this day, in the city of David, a Saviour, who is the Christ, the Lord.
042	LUK	002	012	And this shall be the sign to you: Ye shall find a babe wrapped in swathing-clothes, [[lying]] in a manger.
042	LUK	002	013	And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,
042	LUK	002	014	“Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace among men of good will!”
042	LUK	002	015	And it came to pass, when the angels had gone away from them into heaven, that the shepherds said one to another, Let us go at once to Bethlehem, and see that which hath come to pass, which the Lord hath made known to us.
042	LUK	002	016	And they came with haste, and found Mary and Joseph, and the babe lying in the manger.
042	LUK	002	017	And when they had seen it, they made known abroad what had been told them concerning this child.
042	LUK	002	018	And all who heard wondered at the things which were told them by the shepherds.
042	LUK	002	019	But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart.
042	LUK	002	020	And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all which they had heard and seen, as had been told them.
042	LUK	002	021	And when eight days were completed for him to be circumcised, his name was called Jesus, the name given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.
042	LUK	002	022	And when the days of their purification according to the law of Moses were completed, they brought him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord,
042	LUK	002	023	as it is written in the law of the Lord: “Every first-born male shall be called holy to the Lord,”
042	LUK	002	024	and to offer a sacrifice, according to what is directed in the law of the Lord: “A pair of turtle doves, or two young pigeons.”
042	LUK	002	025	And lo! there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon; and he was a righteous and devout man, waiting for the consolation of Israel. And the Holy Spirit was upon him;
042	LUK	002	026	and it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit, that he should not see death before he had seen the Christ of the Lord.
042	LUK	002	027	And he came in the Spirit into the temple; and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him according to the custom of the law,
042	LUK	002	028	he took him in his arms, and blessed God, and said,
042	LUK	002	029	Lord! now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word;
042	LUK	002	030	for mine eyes have seen thy salvation,
042	LUK	002	031	which thou hast prepared before the face of all the peoples;
042	LUK	002	032	a light to enlighten the gentiles, and to be the glory of thy people Israel.
042	LUK	002	033	And his father and his mother marveled at what was spoken concerning him.
042	LUK	002	034	And Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary his mother, Behold, this child is appointed for the fall and rising of many in Israel, and for a sign that will be spoken against; —
042	LUK	002	035	yea, a sword will pierce through thine own soul, —that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.
042	LUK	002	036	And there was Anna, a prophetess, daughter of Phanuel: of the tribe of Asher; she was of great age, and had lived with a husband seven years from her virginity;
042	LUK	002	037	and she was a widow eighty-four years old, who never left the temple, worshipping with fastings and prayers night and day.
042	LUK	002	038	And she came up at this very time, and gave thanks to God, and spoke of him to all that were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem.
042	LUK	002	039	And when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their own city Nazareth.
042	LUK	002	040	And the child grew, and waxed strong, being filled with wisdom; and the grace of God was upon him.
042	LUK	002	041	Now his parents used to go yearly to Jerusalem at the feast of the passover.
042	LUK	002	042	And when he was twelve years old, and they went up, after the custom of the feast,
042	LUK	002	043	and had completed the days, on their returning, the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and his parents did not know it,
042	LUK	002	044	but, supposing him to be in the company, went a day's journey; and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance;
042	LUK	002	045	and not finding him, they returned to Jerusalem in search of him.
042	LUK	002	046	And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the temple sitting in the midst of the teachers, both listening to them and asking them questions.
042	LUK	002	047	And all who heard him were astonished at his understanding and his answers.
042	LUK	002	048	And when they saw him, they were amazed; and his mother said to him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I have been seeking thee in much distress.
042	LUK	002	049	And he said to them, Why is it that ye have been seeking me? Did ye not know that I must be about my Father's business?
042	LUK	002	050	And they understood not what he spoke to them.
042	LUK	002	051	And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject to them. And his mother kept all these things in her heart.
042	LUK	002	052	And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men.
042	LUK	003	001	Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene,
042	LUK	003	002	when Annas and Caiaphas were high-priests, the word of God came to John, the son of Zachariah, in the wilderness.
042	LUK	003	003	And he came into all the country about the Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins;
042	LUK	003	004	as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet: “The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare the way of the Lord, make straight his paths!
042	LUK	003	005	Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be made low; and the crooked places shall be made straight, and the rough ways smooth;
042	LUK	003	006	and all flesh shall see the salvation of God.”
042	LUK	003	007	He said therefore to the multitudes that came forth to be baptized by him, Brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?
042	LUK	003	008	Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance; and begin not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham for our father; for I say to you, that God is able out of these stones to raise up children to Abraham.
042	LUK	003	009	And already also is the axe lying at the root of the trees; every tree therefore that beareth not good fruit is to be cut down, and cast into the fire.
042	LUK	003	010	And the multitudes asked him, saying, What then must we do?
042	LUK	003	011	He answered and said to them, He that hath two coats, let him impart to him that hath none; and he that hath food, let him do likewise.
042	LUK	003	012	And there came also publicans to be baptized, and said to him, Teacher, what must we do?
042	LUK	003	013	And he said to them, Exact no more than hath been ordered you.
042	LUK	003	014	And soldiers also asked him, saying, And what must we do? And he said to them, Do violence to no one, accuse no one falsely, and be content with your wages.
042	LUK	003	015	And while the people were in expectation, and all were considering in their hearts concerning John, whether he were the Christ,
042	LUK	003	016	John answered and said to them all, I indeed baptize you with water; but he who is mightier than I is coming, the latchet of whose sandals I am not worthy to loose; he will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and in fire.
042	LUK	003	017	His winnowing-shovel is in his hand to thoroughly cleanse his threshing-floor, and gather the wheat into his garner; but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire.
042	LUK	003	018	And giving many other exhortations he published the glad tidings to the people.
042	LUK	003	019	But Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him on account of Herodias the wife of his brother, and on account of all the evil deeds which Herod had done,
042	LUK	003	020	added this also to them all, that he shut up John in prison.
042	LUK	003	021	And it came to pass, when all the people had been baptized, and Jesus also had been baptized, and was praying, that the heaven was opened,
042	LUK	003	022	and the Holy Spirit descended upon him in a bodily shape as a dove; and a voice came from heaven: “Thou art my beloved Son; with thee I am well pleased.”
042	LUK	003	023	And Jesus himself was, when he began, about thirty years of age, being, as was supposed, the son of Joseph, who was the son of Heli,
042	LUK	003	024	who was the son of Matthath, who was the son of Levi, who was the son of Melchi, who was the son of Jannai, who was the son of Joseph,
042	LUK	003	025	who was the son of Mattathias, who was the son of Amos, who was the son of Nahum, who was the son of Esli, who was the son of Naggai,
042	LUK	003	026	who was the son of Maath, who was the son of Mattathias, who was the son of Shimei, who was the son of Josech, who was the son of Joda,
042	LUK	003	027	who was the son of Joanan, who was the son of Rhesa, who was the son of Zerubbabel, who was the son of Shealtiel, who was the son of Neri,
042	LUK	003	028	who was the son of Melchi, who was the son of Addi, who was the son of Kosam, who was the son of Elmadam, who was the son of Er,
042	LUK	003	029	who was the son of Jesus, who was the son of Eliezer, who was the son of Jorim, who was the son of Matthath, who was the son of Levi,
042	LUK	003	030	who was the son of Simeon, who was the son of Judah, who was the son of Joseph, who was the son of Jonam, who was the son of Eliakim,
042	LUK	003	031	who was the son of Melea, who was the son of Menna, who was the son of Mattatha, who was the son of Nathan, who was the son of David,
042	LUK	003	032	who was the son of Jesse, who was the son of Obed, who was the son of Boaz, who was the son of Salma, who was the son of Nahshon,
042	LUK	003	033	who was the son of Amminadab, who was the son of Admin, who was the son of Arni, who was the son of Hezron, who was the son of Pharez, who was the son of Judah,
042	LUK	003	034	who was the son of Jacob, who was the son of Isaac, who was the son of Abraham, who was the son of Terah, who was the son of Nahor,
042	LUK	003	035	who was the son of Serug, who was the son of Reu, who was the son of Peleg, who was the son of Eber, who was the son of Shelah,
042	LUK	003	036	who was the son of Cainan, who was the son of Arphaxad, who was the son of Shem, who was the son of Noah, who was the son of Lamech,
042	LUK	003	037	who was the son of Methuselah, who was the son of Enoch, who was the son of Jared, who was the son of Mahalaleel, who was the son of Cainan,
042	LUK	003	038	who was the son of Enos, who was the son of Seth, who was the son of Adam, who was the son of God.
042	LUK	004	001	And Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan, and was led in the Spirit in the wilderness
042	LUK	004	002	forty days, tempted by the Devil. And he ate nothing in those days; and when they were ended, he was hungry.
042	LUK	004	003	And the Devil said to him, If thou art the Son of God, command this stone that it become a loaf of bread.
042	LUK	004	004	And Jesus answered him, It is written, “Not on bread alone shall man live.”
042	LUK	004	005	And taking him up, he showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.
042	LUK	004	006	And the Devil said to him, All this power will I give thee, and their glory; because to me it hath been delivered, and I give it to whomever I will.
042	LUK	004	007	If thou then wilt worship me, it shall all be thine.
042	LUK	004	008	And Jesus answering said to him, It is written, “Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.”
042	LUK	004	009	And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set him on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to him, If thou art the Son of God, cast thyself down from hence;
042	LUK	004	010	for it is written, “He will give his angels charge concerning thee, to guard thee;
042	LUK	004	011	and in their hands they will bear thee up, that thou mayst not dash thy foot against a stone.”
042	LUK	004	012	And Jesus answering said to him, It hath been said, “Thou shalt not make trial of the Lord thy God.”
042	LUK	004	013	And when he had brought every temptation to an end, the Devil departed from him for a season.
042	LUK	004	014	And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee; and there went out a report concerning him through all the surrounding country
042	LUK	004	015	And he taught in their synagogues, honored by all.
042	LUK	004	016	And he came to Nazara, where he had been brought up, and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath-day; and stood up to read.
042	LUK	004	017	And there was delivered to him the book of the prophet Isaiah; and unrolling the book, he found the place where it was written,
042	LUK	004	018	“The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he anointed me to preach glad tidings to the poor; he hath sent me to proclaim deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty the oppressed,
042	LUK	004	019	to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.”
042	LUK	004	020	And rolling up the book, he gave it back to the attendant, and sat down; and the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed upon him.
042	LUK	004	021	And he began to say to them, To-day hath this scripture been fulfilled in your ears.
042	LUK	004	022	And they all spoke in his praise, and wondered at the words of grace which proceeded from his mouth; and they said, Is not this Joseph's son?
042	LUK	004	023	And he said to them, Ye will doubtless say to me this proverb, “Physician, heal thyself;” whatever things we have heard of as having been done in Capernaum, do here too in thy own country.
042	LUK	004	024	And he said, Truly do I say to you, No prophet is acceptable in his own country.
042	LUK	004	025	But I tell you in truth, that there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, and there was a great famine throughout all the land;
042	LUK	004	026	and yet to none of them was Elijah sent, but to Sarepta in Sidonia, to a woman that was a widow.
042	LUK	004	027	And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet; and not one of them was cleansed, but only Naaman the Syrian.
042	LUK	004	028	And all in the synagogue, when they heard this, were filled with wrath.
042	LUK	004	029	And they rose up, and forced him out of the city and took him to the brow of the hill on which their city was built, to cast him down headlong;
042	LUK	004	030	but he, passing through the midst of them, went away.
042	LUK	004	031	And he came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and was teaching them on the sabbath.
042	LUK	004	032	And they were astonished at his teaching; for his word was with authority.
042	LUK	004	033	And in the synagogue there was a man having a spirit of an unclean demon, and he cried out with a loud voice,
042	LUK	004	034	Ha! what have we to do with thee, Jesus of Nazareth? Thou hast come to destroy us. I know who thou art, the Holy One of God.
042	LUK	004	035	And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Be silent, and come out of him. And the demon threw him down in the midst, and came out of him, having done him no hurt.
042	LUK	004	036	And all were amazed; and they spoke with one another, saying, What kind of word is this, that with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits, and they come out?
042	LUK	004	037	And there went out a report concerning him into every place of the surrounding country.
042	LUK	004	038	And he arose and went from the synagogue into the house of Simon. And Simon's wife's mother was seized with a great fever; and they besought him for her.
042	LUK	004	039	And standing over her, he rebuked the fever, and it left her. And immediately she arose and waited on them.
042	LUK	004	040	And when the sun was setting, all who had any sick with divers diseases brought them to him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them.
042	LUK	004	041	And demons also came out from many, crying out, and saying, Thou art the Son of God. And he rebuked them, and did not suffer them to speak, because they knew that he was the Christ.
042	LUK	004	042	And when it was day, he went out, and betook himself to a desert place; and the multitudes went in search of him; and they came to him, and would have prevented him from leaving them.
042	LUK	004	043	But he said to them, I must publish the good tidings of the kingdom of God to the other cities also; because for this I was sent forth.
042	LUK	004	044	And he continued to preach in the synagogues of Galilee.
042	LUK	005	001	And it came to pass, as the multitude was pressing upon him and hearing the word of God, that he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret,
042	LUK	005	002	and saw two boats standing by the lake; but the fishermen had gone out of them, and had washed the nets.
042	LUK	005	003	And going into one of the boats, which was Simon's, he asked him to put out a little from the land. And sitting down in the boat, he taught the multitudes.
042	LUK	005	004	And when he had done speaking, he said to Simon, Put out into deep water, and let down your nets for a draught.
042	LUK	005	005	And Simon answering said, Master, we toiled all night, and took nothing; but at thy word I will let down the nets.
042	LUK	005	006	And having done this, they inclosed great multitude of fishes; and their nets began to break.
042	LUK	005	007	And they beckoned to their partners in the other boat, to come and help them; and they came, and filled both the boats, so that they began to sink.
042	LUK	005	008	And Simon Peter seeing it fell down at the knees of Jesus, saying, Depart from me, Lord, for I am a sinful man.
042	LUK	005	009	For he and all that were with him were amazed at the draught of fishes, which they had taken;
042	LUK	005	010	and so were also James and John the sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon And Jesus said to Simon, Fear not; henceforth thou shalt catch men.
042	LUK	005	011	And when they had brought their boats to land, they left everything, and followed him.
042	LUK	005	012	And it came to pass, when he was in one of the cities, lo! a man full of leprosy; and seeing Jesus, he fell on his face, and besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst cleanse me.
042	LUK	005	013	And he put forth his hand and touched him, saying, I will; be thou cleansed. And immediately the leprosy left him.
042	LUK	005	014	And he charged him to tell no one: but go, and show thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing as Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.
042	LUK	005	015	But so much the more went abroad the report concerning him; and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed of their infirmities.
042	LUK	005	016	But he was wont to withdraw to desert places, and pray.
042	LUK	005	017	And it came to pass on a certain day, that he was teaching, and there were sitting by Pharisees and teachers of the law, who had come from every town of Galilee and Judea, and from Jerusalem; and the power of the Lord was present that he might heal.
042	LUK	005	018	And lo! men brought on a bed a man that was palsied; and they endeavored to bring him in, and to set him before him.
042	LUK	005	019	And not finding any way to bring him in because of the multitude, they went upon the house-top, and let him down through the tiling with the couch into the midst before Jesus.
042	LUK	005	020	And seeing their faith, he said, Man, thy sins have been forgiven thee.
042	LUK	005	021	And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this that speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God alone?
042	LUK	005	022	But Jesus, perceiving their thoughts, answered and said to them, What are ye thinking in your hearts?
042	LUK	005	023	Which is easier? to say, Thy sins have been forgiven thee? or to say, Arise, and walk?
042	LUK	005	024	But that ye may know that the Son of man hath authority on earth to forgive sins, —he said to the palsied man, —I say to thee, Arise, and take up thy couch, and go to thy house.
042	LUK	005	025	And he immediately rose up before them, and took up that whereon he lay, and went away to his house, giving glory to God.
042	LUK	005	026	And amazement seized them all, and they gave glory to God, and were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things to-day.
042	LUK	005	027	And after these things he went out, and saw a publican named Levi, sitting at the custom-house; and he said to him, Follow me.
042	LUK	005	028	And leaving everything, he arose and followed him.
042	LUK	005	029	And Levi made a great feast for him at his house, and there was a great company of publicans and others, who were reclining at table with them.
042	LUK	005	030	And the Pharisees and their scribes murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with the publicans and sinners?
042	LUK	005	031	And Jesus answering said to them, They who are well do not need a physician, but they who are sick.
042	LUK	005	032	I have not come to call righteous men, but sinners to repentance.
042	LUK	005	033	And they said to him, The disciples of John fast often, and make prayers, and likewise those of the Pharisees; but thine eat and drink.
042	LUK	005	034	But Jesus said to them, Can ye make the companions of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them?
042	LUK	005	035	But the days will come—and when the bridegroom is taken from them, then will they fast in those days.
042	LUK	005	036	And he spoke also a parable to them: No one taketh a patch from a new garment and putteth it upon an old one; for then both the new garment would be rent, and the patch from the new garment would not match with the old.
042	LUK	005	037	And no one putteth new wine into old skins; for the new wine would burst the skins, and would itself run out, and the skins would be spoilt.
042	LUK	005	038	But new wine must be put into new skins.
042	LUK	005	039	And no one, having drunk old wine, desireth new; for he saith, The old is good.
042	LUK	006	001	And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first, that he was going through grain-fields; and his disciples plucked the ears of grain, and ate them, rubbing them with their hands.
042	LUK	006	002	And some of the Pharisees said, Why are ye doing that which it is not lawful to do on the sabbath?
042	LUK	006	003	And Jesus answering them, said, Have ye not even read what David did, when he was himself hungry, and they who were with him?
042	LUK	006	004	how he went into the house of God, and took and ate the show-bread, and gave it also to those who were with him, which it is not lawful for any to eat but the priests alone?
042	LUK	006	005	And he said to them, The Son of man is lord even of the sabbath.
042	LUK	006	006	And it came to pass on another sabbath, that he entered into the synagogue, and taught; and there was a man there whose right hand was withered.
042	LUK	006	007	And the scribes and the Pharisees were watching whether he would heal on the sabbath, that they might find an accusation against him.
042	LUK	006	008	But he knew their thoughts; and he said to the man having the withered hand, Rise, and stand up in the midst. And he arose, and stood up.
042	LUK	006	009	And Jesus said to them, I ask you whether it is lawful on the sabbath to do good, or to do evil; to save life, or to kill?
042	LUK	006	010	And looking round on them all, he said to him, Stretch forth thy hand. And he did so; and his hand was restored.
042	LUK	006	011	But they were filled with madness, and conferred with one another as to what they should do to Jesus.
042	LUK	006	012	And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into the mountain to pray; and he continued all night in prayer to God.
042	LUK	006	013	And when it was day, he called to him his disciples; and he chose from them twelve, whom he also named apostles;
042	LUK	006	014	Simon, whom he named Peter, and Andrew his brother, and James and John, and Philip and Bartholomew,
042	LUK	006	015	and Matthew and Thomas, and James the Son of Alphaeus, and Simon called the zealot,
042	LUK	006	016	and Judas the brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor.
042	LUK	006	017	And he came down with them, and stood on a level place with a great multitude of his disciples, and a great crowd of the people from all Judaea and Jerusalem and the sea-coast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases.
042	LUK	006	018	And they that were harassed with unclean spirits were cured.
042	LUK	006	019	And the whole multitude sought to touch him, because power went out of him and healed all.
042	LUK	006	020	And raising his eyes toward his disciples, he said, Blessed are ye poor; for yours is the kingdom of God.
042	LUK	006	021	Blessed are ye that hunger now; for ye will be filled. Blessed are ye that weep now; for ye will laugh.
042	LUK	006	022	Blessed are ye when men hate you, and when they exclude you, and revile and cast out your name as evil, on account of the Son of man.
042	LUK	006	023	Rejoice in that day, and leap for joy; for lo! your reward is great in heaven; for thus their fathers did to the prophets.
042	LUK	006	024	But woe to you that are rich! for ye have received your consolation.
042	LUK	006	025	Woe to you that are full now! for ye will hunger. Woe to you that laugh now! for ye will mourn and weep.
042	LUK	006	026	Woe, when all men speak well of you! for so did their fathers of the false prophets.
042	LUK	006	027	But I say to you who hear: Love your enemies; do good to those who hate you;
042	LUK	006	028	bless those who curse you; pray for those who are spiteful to you.
042	LUK	006	029	To him that smiteth thee on one cheek, offer also the other; and him that taketh away thy cloak, forbid not to take thy coat also.
042	LUK	006	030	Give to every one that asketh of thee; and from him that taketh away thy goods, demand them not again.
042	LUK	006	031	And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also in like manner to them.
042	LUK	006	032	And if ye love those who love you, what thanks do ye deserve? for sinners also love those who love them.
042	LUK	006	033	For if ye do good to those who do good to you, what thanks do ye deserve? even sinners do the same.
042	LUK	006	034	And if ye lend to those from whom ye expect to receive, what thanks do ye deserve? even sinners lend to sinners, to receive as much in return.
042	LUK	006	035	But love your enemies, and do good and lend, despairing of no one; and your reward will be great, and ye will be sons of the Most High; for he is kind to the unthankful and wicked.
042	LUK	006	036	Be merciful, as your Father is merciful.
042	LUK	006	037	And judge not, and ye will not be judged; and condemn not, and ye will not be condemned; forgive, and ye will be forgiven;
042	LUK	006	038	give, and it will be given to you; good measure, pressed down, shaken together, running over, will men give into your bosom; for with what measure ye mete, it will be measured to you in return.
042	LUK	006	039	And he spoke also a parable to them: Can the blind lead the blind? Will they not both fall into a ditch?
042	LUK	006	040	A disciple is not above his teacher; but every one when fully instructed will be as his teacher.
042	LUK	006	041	And why dost thou look at the mote in thy brother's eye, and not perceive the beam that is in thine own eye?
042	LUK	006	042	How canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me take out the mote that is in thine eye, when thou thyself perceivest not the beam in thine own eye? Hypocrite! first cast the beam out of thine own eye, and then thou wilt see clearly to take out the mote that is in thy brother's eye.
042	LUK	006	043	For there is no good tree that beareth bad fruit; and again, there is no bad tree that beareth good fruit.
042	LUK	006	044	For every tree is known by its own fruit; for from thorns men do not gather figs, nor from a bramble-bush do they gather grapes.
042	LUK	006	045	The good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and the evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth that which is evil; for out of the abundance of his heart his mouth speaketh.
042	LUK	006	046	But why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?
042	LUK	006	047	Every one that cometh to me and heareth my sayings and doeth them, I will show you whom he is like.
042	LUK	006	048	He is like a man building a house, who dug deep, and laid its foundation on a rock; and when a flood arose, the stream dashed against that house, and could not shake it; because it was well built.
042	LUK	006	049	But he that heareth and doeth not, is like a man that built a house upon the earth without a foundation; against which the stream dashed, and it fell at once, and the ruin of that house was great.
042	LUK	007	001	When he had ended all his discourse in the hearing of the people, he entered Capernaum.
042	LUK	007	002	And a certain centurion's servant, who was dear to him, was sick, and about to die.
042	LUK	007	003	And having heard about Jesus, he sent to him elders of the Jews, and besought him to come and save his servant.
042	LUK	007	004	And they came to Jesus, and besought him earnestly, saying, He is worthy that thou shouldst do this for him;
042	LUK	007	005	for he loveth our nation, and himself built the synagogue for us.
042	LUK	007	006	And Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends, saying, Lord, trouble not thyself; for I am not worthy that thou shouldst come under my roof;
042	LUK	007	007	on which account I did not think myself worthy to come to thee; but command with a word, and let my servant be healed.
042	LUK	007	008	For even I am a man set under authority, having soldiers under me; and I say to this one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.
042	LUK	007	009	And Jesus hearing this, wondered at him; and turning round said to the multitude that followed him, I say to you, Not even in Israel have I found such faith.
042	LUK	007	010	And they who were sent, returning to the house, found the servant well.
042	LUK	007	011	And it came to pass the day after, that he was going to a city called Nain; and many of his disciples were with him, and a great multitude.
042	LUK	007	012	And as he came near the gate of the city, lo! there was carried out dead an only son of his mother, and she was a widow; and a great multitude from the city was with her.
042	LUK	007	013	And when the Lord saw her, he was moved with compassion for her, and said to her, Weep not.
042	LUK	007	014	And he came up, and touched the bier; and they who bore it stood still; and he said, Young man, I say to thee, Rise.
042	LUK	007	015	And he that was dead sat up and began to speak; and he gave him to his mother.
042	LUK	007	016	And fear seized on all, and they gave glory to God, saying, A great prophet hath risen up among us; and, God hath visited his people.
042	LUK	007	017	And this report about him went forth in all Judaea, and in all the neighboring country.
042	LUK	007	018	And the disciples of John told him all these things.
042	LUK	007	019	And calling to him two of his disciples, John sent them to the Lord, saying, Art thou he that is to come, or are we to look for another?
042	LUK	007	020	And the men came to him and said, John the Baptist hath sent us to thee, saying, Art thou he that is to come, or are we to look for another?
042	LUK	007	021	In that hour he cured many of diseases, and plagues, and evil spirits, and to many who were blind he gave sight.
042	LUK	007	022	And he answered and said to them, Go and tell John what ye have seen and heard; that the blind receive sight, the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor good tidings are brought;
042	LUK	007	023	and blessed is he, whoever shall find no occasion of stumbling in me.
042	LUK	007	024	And when the messengers of John had departed, he began to say to the multitudes concerning John, What have ye gone out into the wilderness to see? the reeds shaken by the wind?
042	LUK	007	025	But what have ye gone out to see? a man clothed in soft raiment? Lo! they who wear gorgeous apparel, and live luxuriously, are in kings' palaces.
042	LUK	007	026	But what have ye gone out to see? A prophet? Yea, I say to you, and more than a prophet.
042	LUK	007	027	This is he of whom it is written, “Lo! I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee.”
042	LUK	007	028	I say to you, Among those born of women there is no greater prophet than John; but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.
042	LUK	007	029	And all the people when they heard him, and the publicans, acknowledged God as righteous by being baptized with the baptism of John.
042	LUK	007	030	But the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the purpose of God toward themselves, not being baptized by him.
042	LUK	007	031	To what then shall I compare the men of this generation, and what are they like?
042	LUK	007	032	They are like children sitting in the market-place, and calling one to another, saying, We piped to you, and ye did not dance; we sung a dirge, and ye did not weep.
042	LUK	007	033	For John the Baptist hath come not eating bread, nor drinking wine; and ye say, He hath a demon.
042	LUK	007	034	The Son of man hath come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold, a glutton and a wine-bibber, a friend of publicans and sinners!
042	LUK	007	035	But wisdom is acknowledged by all her children.
042	LUK	007	036	And one of the Pharisees asked him to eat with him; and he went into the Pharisee's house, and reclined at the table.
042	LUK	007	037	And lo! a woman who was in the city, a sinner, learning that he was at table in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster-bottle of ointment,
042	LUK	007	038	and standing behind at his feet, weeping, began to wet his feet with tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.
042	LUK	007	039	And the Pharisee who had invited him, when he saw this, said within himself, This man, if he were a prophet, would know who, and what sort of woman, this is that toucheth him; for she is a sinner.
042	LUK	007	040	And Jesus answering said to him, Simon, I have somewhat to say to thee. And he saith, Teacher, say on.
042	LUK	007	041	A certain money-lender had two debtors; one owed five hundred denaries, and the other fifty.
042	LUK	007	042	When they had nothing to pay, he freely remitted the debt of both. Which of them, now, will love him the most?
042	LUK	007	043	Simon answering said, He, I suppose, to whom he remitted the most. And he said to him, Thou hast judged rightly.
042	LUK	007	044	And turning to the woman, he said to Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered thy house, no water didst thou give me for my feet; but she wet my feet with tears, and wiped them with her hair.
042	LUK	007	045	No kiss didst thou give me; but she, from the time I came in, did not cease to kiss my feet.
042	LUK	007	046	My head with oil thou didst not anoint; but she anointed my feet with costly ointment.
042	LUK	007	047	Wherefore, I say to thee, her many sins have been forgiven; for she loved much; but he to whom little is forgiven loveth little.
042	LUK	007	048	And he said to her, Thy sins have been forgiven.
042	LUK	007	049	And those who were at table with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that even forgiveth sins?
042	LUK	007	050	But he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.
042	LUK	008	001	And it came to pass afterward, that he journeyed through cities and villages, preaching and publishing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God; and the twelve were with him,
042	LUK	008	002	and certain women who had been cured of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom had come seven demons,
042	LUK	008	003	and Joanna, the wife of Chuzas, Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others, who afforded them aid from their substance.
042	LUK	008	004	And a great multitude collecting together, and people from the cities going out to him, he spoke by a parable:
042	LUK	008	005	A sower went forth to sow his seed; and as he sowed, some seeds fell by the way-side; and they were trodden down, and the birds of the air devoured them.
042	LUK	008	006	And others fell upon rocky ground; and when they had sprung up they withered away, because they had no moisture.
042	LUK	008	007	And others fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up with them, and choked them.
042	LUK	008	008	And others fell upon good ground, and sprung up, and bore fruit, a hundred-fold. While saying these things, he cried aloud, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
042	LUK	008	009	And his disciples asked him what this parable meant.
042	LUK	008	010	And he said, To you it hath been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God; but to others [[these things are spoken]] in parables; that while seeing they may not see, and while hearing they may not understand.
042	LUK	008	011	Now the meaning of the parable is this. The seed is the word of God.
042	LUK	008	012	Those by the way-side are they that hear; then cometh the Devil and taketh away the word from their heart, that they may not believe and be saved.
042	LUK	008	013	Those on the rocky ground are they who, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root; and for a while they believe, and in time of temptation fall away.
042	LUK	008	014	And those seeds which fell among the thorns, these are they who, when they have heard, go away and are choked with the cares and riches and pleasures of life, and bring no fruit to perfection.
042	LUK	008	015	But the seeds on the good ground, these are they who in an honest and good heart, when they have heard the word, hold it fast, and bear fruit with constancy.
042	LUK	008	016	And no one having lighted a lamp, covereth it with a vessel, or putteth it under a bed; but setteth it on a lampstand, that those who come in may see the light.
042	LUK	008	017	For nothing is secret, that will not be made manifest; nor hidden, that will not be known, and come to light.
042	LUK	008	018	Take heed therefore how ye hear; for whoever hath, to him will be given; and whoever hath not, from him will be taken even what he seemeth to have.
042	LUK	008	019	And his mother and his brothers came where he was, and could not get to him on account of the crowd.
042	LUK	008	020	And word was brought to him, Thy mother and thy brothers stand without, desiring to see thee.
042	LUK	008	021	And he answering said to them, My mother and my brothers are these, who hear the word of God, and do it.
042	LUK	008	022	Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a boat with his disciples, and said to them, Let us go over to the other side of the lake; and they put off.
042	LUK	008	023	But as they were sailing, he fell asleep. And there came down a storm of wind on the lake, and they were filling with water, and were in jeopardy.
042	LUK	008	024	And they came and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we are perishing! And he rose, and rebuked the wind, and the surging of the water; and they ceased, and there was a calm.
042	LUK	008	025	And he said to them, Where is your faith? And they were afraid, and wondered, saying one to another, Who then is this, that he commandeth even the winds and the water, and they obey him?
042	LUK	008	026	And they sailed to the country of the Gergesenes, which is over against Galilee.
042	LUK	008	027	And when he had landed, there met him a certain man out of the city who had demons, and for a long time had worn no clothes, and abode not in a house, but in the tombs.
042	LUK	008	028	And seeing Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and said with a loud voice, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, Son of the most high God? I beseech thee, do not torment me.
042	LUK	008	029	For he was about to command the unclean spirit to come out of the man; for it had possessed him for a long time, and he had been kept bound and secured with chains and fetters; and bursting the bands, he had been driven by the demon into the wilderness.
042	LUK	008	030	And Jesus asked him, saying, What is thy name? And he said, Legion; because many demons had entered into him.
042	LUK	008	031	And they besought him not to command them to go away into the abyss.
042	LUK	008	032	Now there was there a herd of many swine feeding on the mountain; and they besought him to permit them to go into them. And he permitted them.
042	LUK	008	033	And the demons coming out of the man went into the swine; and the herd rushed down the steep into the lake, and were drowned.
042	LUK	008	034	And the herdsmen, seeing what was done, fled, and told the news in the city and in the country.
042	LUK	008	035	And they went out to see what had been done. And they came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons had gone out sitting, clothed, and in his right mind, at the feet of Jesus; and they were afraid.
042	LUK	008	036	And they who had seen it told them how he that was possessed by demons was made well.
042	LUK	008	037	And the whole multitude in the surrounding country of the Gergesenes besought him to depart from them; for they were seized with great fear. And he went on board a boat and returned.
042	LUK	008	038	And the man out of whom the demons had gone besought him that he might be with him. But he sent him away, saying,
042	LUK	008	039	Return to thy house, and tell what great things God hath done for thee. And he went and published through the whole city what great things Jesus had done for him.
042	LUK	008	040	And it came to pass when Jesus returned, that the multitude welcomed him; for they were all waiting for him.
042	LUK	008	041	And lo! there came a man, named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue; and falling at the feet of Jesus, he besought him to come into his house;
042	LUK	008	042	for he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she was dying. And as he went, the multitudes thronged him.
042	LUK	008	043	And a woman who had had an issue of blood twelve years, and had spent all her living upon physicians, and could not be cured by any one,
042	LUK	008	044	came up behind and touched the fringe of his garment; and immediately her issue of blood ceased.
042	LUK	008	045	And Jesus said, Who touched me? And when all denied it, Peter and those with him said, Master, the multitudes are thronging thee, and pressing against thee.
042	LUK	008	046	But Jesus said, Some one touched me; for I perceived that power went out from me.
042	LUK	008	047	And the woman, seeing that she was discovered, came trembling, and falling down before him declared before all the people for what cause she had touched him, and how she was cured immediately.
042	LUK	008	048	And he said to her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee well; go in peace.
042	LUK	008	049	While he was yet speaking, there cometh one from the house of the ruler of the synagogue, saying, Thy daughter is dead; trouble not the Teacher any further.
042	LUK	008	050	But Jesus hearing this, answered him, Fear not; only believe, and she will be made well.
042	LUK	008	051	And going into the house, he suffered no one to go in with him but Peter and John and James, and the father of the maiden, and the mother.
042	LUK	008	052	And all were weeping, and lamenting for her. But he said, Weep not; she is not dead, but sleeping.
042	LUK	008	053	And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead.
042	LUK	008	054	But he took hold of her hand, and called aloud, saying, Maiden, arise!
042	LUK	008	055	And her spirit returned, and she immediately arose. And he ordered food to be given to her.
042	LUK	008	056	And her parents were amazed. But he charged them to tell no one what had been done.
042	LUK	009	001	And he called together the twelve, and gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases.
042	LUK	009	002	And he sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God, and to heal.
042	LUK	009	003	And he said to them, Take nothing for the journey, neither a staff, nor a bag, nor bread, nor money, nor have two coats apiece.
042	LUK	009	004	And into whatever house ye enter, there abide, and from it take your departure.
042	LUK	009	005	And whoever shall not receive you, shake off, when ye leave that city, even the dust from your feet as a testimony against them.
042	LUK	009	006	And they departed, and went through the towns publishing the glad tidings, and performing cures everywhere.
042	LUK	009	007	And Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was taking place, and was perplexed; because it was said by some that John had risen from the dead;
042	LUK	009	008	and by some, that Elijah had appeared; and by others, that one of the old prophets had risen.
042	LUK	009	009	But Herod said, John I beheaded; but who is this, about whom I hear such things? And he sought to see him.
042	LUK	009	010	And the apostles returned and told him what they had done; and taking them with him, he withdrew privately to a city called Bethsaida.
042	LUK	009	011	But the multitudes, when they knew it, followed him; and he welcomed them, and spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and healed those who had need of healing.
042	LUK	009	012	And when the day began to decline, the twelve came and said to him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages around, and the open country, and lodge, and get food; for we are here in a desert place.
042	LUK	009	013	But he said to them, Do ye give them food. And they said, We have not more than five loaves and two fishes, unless we ourselves should go and buy food for l all these people.
042	LUK	009	014	They were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, Make them lie down in companies of fifty.
042	LUK	009	015	And they did so, and made them all lie down.
042	LUK	009	016	Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and broke and gave them to the disciples to set before the multitude.
042	LUK	009	017	And they ate, and were all filled; and what remained to them of fragments was taken up, twelve baskets.
042	LUK	009	018	And it came to pass as he was in a private place praying, that his disciples were with him; and he asked them, saying, Who do the multitudes say that I am?
042	LUK	009	019	And they answering said, John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; and others, that one of the old prophets hath risen.
042	LUK	009	020	And he said to them, But who do ye say that I am? And Peter answering said, The Christ of God.
042	LUK	009	021	But he strictly charged them, and commanded them to tell this to no one;
042	LUK	009	022	saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be put to death, and rise again on the third day.
042	LUK	009	023	And he said to all, If any one chooseth to come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily, and follow me.
042	LUK	009	024	For whoever chooseth to save his life, will lose it; and whoever loseth his life for my sake, he will save it.
042	LUK	009	025	For what is a man profited, if he gain the whole world, and lose or forfeit himself?
042	LUK	009	026	For whoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him will the Son of man be ashamed, when be cometh in his glory, and that of his Father, and of the holy angels.
042	LUK	009	027	And I tell you in truth, that there are some of those standing here who will not taste of death, till they have seen the kingdom of God.
042	LUK	009	028	And it came to pass about eight days after this discourse, that he took with him Peter and John and James, and went up into the mountain to pray.
042	LUK	009	029	And while he was praying, the appearance of his countenance was changed, and his raiment became white and glistening.
042	LUK	009	030	And lo! two men were talking with him, who were Moses and Elijah;
042	LUK	009	031	who appeared in glory, and spoke of his departure which he was about to fulfill in Jerusalem.
042	LUK	009	032	But Peter and those who were with him were weighed down with sleep. But when they awoke, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him.
042	LUK	009	033	And it came to pass as they were parting from him, that Peter said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here; and let us make three tents, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah; —not knowing what he said.
042	LUK	009	034	But as he was saying this, there came a cloud and overshadowed them; and they were afraid as they entered the cloud.
042	LUK	009	035	And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, “This is my chosen Son; hear him.”
042	LUK	009	036	And when the voice had come, Jesus was found alone. And they kept it secret, and told no one in those days anything of what they had seen.
042	LUK	009	037	And it came to pass that on the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, a great multitude met him.
042	LUK	009	038	And lo! a man from the multitude cried out, saying, Teacher, I beseech thee, look upon my son, for he is my only child;
042	LUK	009	039	and lo! a spirit seizeth him, and suddenly crieth out, and convulseth him so that he foameth, and it departeth from him hardly, taking away all his strength.
042	LUK	009	040	And I besought thy disciples to cast it out, and they could not.
042	LUK	009	041	And Jesus answering said, O unbelieving and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and bear with you? Bring thy son hither.
042	LUK	009	042	And while he was yet coming, the demon threw him down, and convulsed him. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and delivered him to his father.
042	LUK	009	043	And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. But while they were all wondering at all the things which he did, he said to his disciples,
042	LUK	009	044	As for you, let these words sink into your ears; for the Son of man is about to be delivered up into the hands of men.
042	LUK	009	045	But they knew not the meaning of these words, and it was hidden from them, that they might not perceive it; and they were afraid to ask him about these words.
042	LUK	009	046	And there arose a reasoning among them, which of them was greatest.
042	LUK	009	047	And Jesus knowing the reasoning of their heart, took a child and set him by his side,
042	LUK	009	048	and said to them, Whoever receiveth this child in my name, receiveth me; and whoever receiveth me, receiveth him who sent me. For he that is least among you all, he is great.
042	LUK	009	049	And John answering said, Master, we saw one casting out demons in thy name, and we forbade him, because he doth not follow in our company.
042	LUK	009	050	But Jesus said to him, Forbid him not; for he that is not against you is for you.
042	LUK	009	051	And it came to pass, when the time was near for his being received up, that he himself steadily set his face to go to Jerusalem.
042	LUK	009	052	And he sent messengers before him; and they went and entered a city of the Samaritans, to make ready for him.
042	LUK	009	053	And they did not receive him, because his face was as if he were going to Jerusalem.
042	LUK	009	054	And the disciples James and John, on seeing it, said, Lord, wilt thou have us bid fire come down from heaven, and consume them?
042	LUK	009	055	But he turned and rebuked them.
042	LUK	009	056	And they went to another village.
042	LUK	009	057	And as they were traveling on the way, one said to him, I will follow thee wherever thou goest.
042	LUK	009	058	And Jesus said to him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have lodging-places; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.
042	LUK	009	059	And he said to another, Follow me. But he said, Suffer me first to go and bury my father.
042	LUK	009	060	And he said to him, Let the dead bury their own dead; but go thou and carry the tidings of the kingdom of God.
042	LUK	009	061	And another also said, I will follow thee, Lord; but first let me bid farewell to those who are in my house.
042	LUK	009	062	And Jesus said to him, No one who looketh back after putting his hand to the plough is fit for the kingdom of God.
042	LUK	010	001	After these things, the Lord appointed also seventy others, and sent them two and two before him into every city and place where he himself was about to come.
042	LUK	010	002	And he said to them, The harvest is great, but the laborers are few. Pray therefore the Lord of the harvest to send forth laborers for his harvest.
042	LUK	010	003	Go forth; lo! I send you as lambs into the midst of wolves.
042	LUK	010	004	Carry no purse, no bag, no sandals; salute no one by the way.
042	LUK	010	005	And into whatever house ye enter, first say, Peace be to this house.
042	LUK	010	006	And if a son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it; if not, it shall return to you.
042	LUK	010	007	And abide in the same house, eating and drinking such things as they give; for the laborer is worthy of his wages. Do not go from house to house.
042	LUK	010	008	And into whatever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat what is set before you,
042	LUK	010	009	and heal the sick that are therein, and say to them, The kingdom of God hath come near to you.
042	LUK	010	010	But into whatever city ye enter, and they receive you not, go out into its streets and say,
042	LUK	010	011	Even the dust of your city that cleaveth to our feet we wipe off to you; but know this, that the kingdom of God hath come near.
042	LUK	010	012	And I tell you, that it will be more tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for that city.
042	LUK	010	013	Woe to thee, Chorazin! woe to thee, Bethsaida! for if the miracles that were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would long ago have repented, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.
042	LUK	010	014	But it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment, than for you.
042	LUK	010	015	And thou, Capernaum! shalt thou be exalted to heaven? thou shalt be brought down to the underworld.
042	LUK	010	016	He that hearkeneth to you, hearkeneth to me; and he that rejecteth you, rejecteth me; but he that rejecteth me, rejecteth him that sent me.
042	LUK	010	017	And the seventy returned with joy, saying, Lord, even the demons are subject to us in thy name.
042	LUK	010	018	And he said to them, I saw Satan fall from heaven like lightning.
042	LUK	010	019	Lo! I have given you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the might of the enemy; and nothing shall by any means hurt you.
042	LUK	010	020	Yet rejoice not in this, that the spirits are subject to you; but rejoice that your names have been written in heaven.
042	LUK	010	021	In that hour he rejoiced in the Holy Spirit, and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that, though thou didst hide these things from the wise and discerning, thou didst reveal them to babes. Yea, Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight. And turning to the disciples he said,
042	LUK	010	022	All things were delivered to me by my Father; and no one knoweth who the Son is, but the Father; and who the Father is, but the Son, and he to whom it is the will of the Son to reveal him.
042	LUK	010	023	And turning to the disciples, he said privately, Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye are seeing.
042	LUK	010	024	For I tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see the things which ye are seeing, and saw them not; and to hear the things which ye are hearing, and heard them not.
042	LUK	010	025	And lo! a certain lawyer stood up to try him, saying, Teacher, what shall I do to inherit everlasting life?
042	LUK	010	026	And he said to him, What is written in the Law? How readest thou?
042	LUK	010	027	And he answering said “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbor as thyself.”
042	LUK	010	028	And he said to him, Thou hast answered rightly; do this, and thou shalt live.
042	LUK	010	029	But he, wishing to justify himself, said to Jesus, And who is my neighbor?
042	LUK	010	030	Jesus answering said, A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among robbers; who after stripping him of his raiment, and wounding him, departed, leaving him half dead.
042	LUK	010	031	And by chance a certain priest was going down on that road; and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.
042	LUK	010	032	And in like manner also a Levite, having arrived at the place, came and saw, and passed by on the other side.
042	LUK	010	033	But a certain Samaritan, as he was journeying, came where he was, and when he saw him, had compassion,
042	LUK	010	034	and went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine, and setting him on his own beast, brought him to an inn, and took care of him.
042	LUK	010	035	And the next day, he took out two denaries and gave them to the host, and said, Take care of him; and whatever thou spendest more, I, when I come back, will repay thee.
042	LUK	010	036	Which of these three, dost thou think, was neighbor to him that fell among the robbers?
042	LUK	010	037	And he said, He that took pity on him. Then said Jesus to him, Go, and do thou likewise.
042	LUK	010	038	And it came to pass, as they journeyed, that he entered into a certain village; and a certain woman, named Martha, received him into her house.
042	LUK	010	039	And she had a sister called Mary, who sat down at the feet of the Lord, and listened to his word.
042	LUK	010	040	But Martha was cumbered about much serving; and she came to him, and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone? Tell her therefore to help me.
042	LUK	010	041	But the Lord answering said to her, Martha, Martha, thou art anxious and troubled about many things.
042	LUK	010	042	But one thing is needful. For Mary hath chosen the good part, which shall not be taken away from her.
042	LUK	011	001	And it came to pass, as he was in a certain place praying, that when he ceased one of his disciples said to him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John taught his disciples.
042	LUK	011	002	And he said to them, When ye pray, say, Father, hallowed be thy name; thy kingdom come;
042	LUK	011	003	give us day by day our daily bread;
042	LUK	011	004	and forgive us our sins, for even we ourselves forgive every one that is indebted to us; and lead us not into temptation.
042	LUK	011	005	And he said to them, Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go to him at midnight, and say to him Friend, lend me three loaves;
042	LUK	011	006	for a friend of mine hath come to me from a journey, and I have nothing to set before him?
042	LUK	011	007	And he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not; the door is now shut, and I and my children are in bed; I cannot rise and give thee.
042	LUK	011	008	I say to you, though he will not rise and give him because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth.
042	LUK	011	009	And I say to you, Ask, and it will be given you; seek, and ye will find; knock, and the door will be opened to you.
042	LUK	011	010	For every one that asketh, receiveth; and he that seeketh, findeth; and to him that knocketh, the door will be opened.
042	LUK	011	011	And what father is there, among you, who, if his son ask for bread, will give him a stone? or if he ask for a fish, will instead of a fish give him a serpent?
042	LUK	011	012	or, if he ask for an egg, will give him a scorpion?
042	LUK	011	013	If ye then, though evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!
042	LUK	011	014	And he was casting out a demon, and it was dumb; and it came to pass, when the demon had gone out, that the dumb man spoke. And the multitudes wondered.
042	LUK	011	015	But some of them said, He casteth out the demons through Beelzebul, the prince of the demons;
042	LUK	011	016	and others, to make trial of him, asked of him a sign from heaven.
042	LUK	011	017	But he, knowing their thoughts, said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and house divided against house falleth.
042	LUK	011	018	And if Satan also be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? For ye say that I cast out the demons through Beelzebul.
042	LUK	011	019	But if I cast out the demons through Beelzebul, through whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore shall they be judges of you.
042	LUK	011	020	But if I cast out the demons through the finger of God, then hath the kingdom of God already come to you.
042	LUK	011	021	When a strong man armed guardeth his palace, his goods are in peace;
042	LUK	011	022	but when one stronger than he cometh upon him and overcometh him, he taketh from him his whole armor wherein he trusted, and divideth his spoils.
042	LUK	011	023	He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.
042	LUK	011	024	When the unclean spirit is gone out from a man, it goeth through dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, it saith, I will return to my house whence I came out.
042	LUK	011	025	And on coming, it findeth it swept and put in order.
042	LUK	011	026	Then it goeth, and taketh with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they enter in, and dwell there; and the last state of that man becometh worse than the first.
042	LUK	011	027	And it came to pass, as he was saying these things, that a certain woman lifted up her voice from the crowd, and said to him, Blessed is the womb that bore thee, and the breasts from which thou drewest nourishment.
042	LUK	011	028	But he said, Blessed rather are they that hear the word of God and keep it.
042	LUK	011	029	And when the crowds were thronging about him, he began to say, This generation is a wicked generation; it seeketh a sign; and no sign will be given it, but the sign of Jonah.
042	LUK	011	030	For as Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites, so will also the Son of man be to this generation.
042	LUK	011	031	The queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and will condemn them; for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and lo! something more than Solomon is here.
042	LUK	011	032	The men of Nineveh will stand up in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and lo! something more than Jonah is here.
042	LUK	011	033	No one when he has lighted a lamp, puts it into a secret place, or under the bushel, but on the lamp-stand, that they who come in may see the light.
042	LUK	011	034	The lamp of the body is thine eye. When thine eye is clear, thy whole body also is in the light; but when it is disordered, thy body also is in darkness.
042	LUK	011	035	Take heed therefore, that the light which is within thee be not darkness.
042	LUK	011	036	If then thy whole body is enlightened, having no part dark, the whole will be as fully enlightened, as when a lamp with its bright shining giveth thee light.
042	LUK	011	037	And when he had done speaking, a Pharisee asked him to dine with him. And he went in and reclined at the table.
042	LUK	011	038	And the Pharisee, seeing it, wondered that he did not bathe before dinner.
042	LUK	011	039	But the Lord said to him, Now ye Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and the platter; but your inside is full of rapacity and wickedness.
042	LUK	011	040	Fools, did not he who made the outside, make the inside also?
042	LUK	011	041	But give what they contain in alms, and lo! all is clean to you.
042	LUK	011	042	But woe to you Pharisees! for ye pay tithes of the mint, and the rue, and every herb; and pass by justice and the love of God. These ought ye to have done, and not to leave those undone.
042	LUK	011	043	Woe to you Pharisees! for ye love the chief seats in the synagogues, and salutations in the markets.
042	LUK	011	044	Woe to you, for ye are as tombs which are unseen, and men walking over them know it not.
042	LUK	011	045	And one of the lawyers answering saith to him, Teacher, in saying these things, thou revilest us also.
042	LUK	011	046	And he said, To you lawyers also, woe! for ye load men with burdens grievous to be borne, and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers.
042	LUK	011	047	Woe to you! for ye build the tombs of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.
042	LUK	011	048	So then ye bear witness to and approve the deeds of your fathers; for they indeed killed them, and ye are building [[their tombs]].
042	LUK	011	049	Therefore the wisdom of God also said, I will send them prophets and apostles, and some of them they will kill and persecute;
042	LUK	011	050	that the blood of all the prophets, which hath been shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;
042	LUK	011	051	from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who was slain between the altar and the temple. Yea, I tell you, it will be required of this generation.
042	LUK	011	052	Woe to you lawyers! because ye have taken away the key of knowledge; ye have not entered yourselves, and those who were entering ye have hindered.
042	LUK	011	053	And as he came out thence, the scribes and the Pharisees began to be very spiteful, and to press him to speak off hand about many things,
042	LUK	011	054	lying in wait to catch something out of his mouth.
042	LUK	012	001	In the mean time, when the multitude was gathered together in myriads, so that they trod one upon another, he began to say to his disciples first, Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.
042	LUK	012	002	But there is nothing covered, that will not be revealed; and hid, that will not be known.
042	LUK	012	003	Therefore, whatever ye have said in darkness, will be heard in the light; and what ye have spoken in the ear in closets, will be proclaimed upon the house-tops.
042	LUK	012	004	And I say to you my friends, Fear not those who kill the body, and after this can do nothing more.
042	LUK	012	005	But I will warn you whom to fear; fear him who after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say to you, fear him.
042	LUK	012	006	Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies? and not one of them is forgotten before God.
042	LUK	012	007	But even the hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not: ye are of more value than many sparrows.
042	LUK	012	008	And I say to you, Every one that acknowledgeth me before men, him will the Son of man also acknowledge before the angels of God.
042	LUK	012	009	But he that hath denied me before men, shall be denied before the angels of God.
042	LUK	012	010	And every one that shall speak a word against the Son of man, it will be forgiven him; but to him that hath blasphemed against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven.
042	LUK	012	011	And when they bring you to the synagogues and the magistrates and the authorities, be not anxious as to how or what ye shall answer, or what ye shall say;
042	LUK	012	012	for the Holy Spirit will teach you in that very hour what ye ought to say.
042	LUK	012	013	And one from the multitude said to him, Teacher, bid my brother divide the inheritance with me.
042	LUK	012	014	But he said to him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you?
042	LUK	012	015	And he said to them, Take heed and beware of all covetousness; for even when one hath great abundance, his life doth not depend upon his possessions.
042	LUK	012	016	And he spoke a parable to them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully.
042	LUK	012	017	And he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do? for I have not where to store my crops.
042	LUK	012	018	And he said, This will I do; I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I store all my crops and my goods;
042	LUK	012	019	and I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast many goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, be merry.
042	LUK	012	020	But God said to him, Fool! this night will thy soul he required of thee; and whose will those things be which thou hast laid up?
042	LUK	012	021	So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich towards God.
042	LUK	012	022	And he said to his disciples, Therefore I say to you, Be not anxious for the life, what ye shall eat; nor for the body, what ye shall put on.
042	LUK	012	023	The life is more than its food, and the body than its raiment.
042	LUK	012	024	Consider the ravens, that they neither sow nor reap; which have neither store-house, nor barn; and God feedeth them. Of how much greater value are ye than the birds!
042	LUK	012	025	And who of you can by anxious thought add a cubit to his life?
042	LUK	012	026	If then ye cannot do even that which is least, why are ye anxious about the rest?
042	LUK	012	027	Consider the lilies, that they neither spin nor weave; and yet I say to you, Not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed like one of these.
042	LUK	012	028	But if God so clothes the herbage in the field, which is to-day, and tomorrow is cast into an oven, how much more will he clothe you, O ye of little faith!
042	LUK	012	029	And seek not ye what ye shall eat, and what ye shall drink; and be not of a doubtful mind.
042	LUK	012	030	For all these things do the nations of the world seek after; and your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things.
042	LUK	012	031	But rather seek his kingdom, and these things will also be given you.
042	LUK	012	032	Fear not, little flock! for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom.
042	LUK	012	033	Sell what ye have, and give alms. Make for yourselves purses which wax not old, treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief approacheth, nor moth destroyeth.
042	LUK	012	034	For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
042	LUK	012	035	Let your loins be girded about, and your lamps burning;
042	LUK	012	036	and be yourselves like men waiting for the return of their lord from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open to him immediately.
042	LUK	012	037	Happy are those servants, whom their lord when he cometh shall find watching; truly do I say to you, that he will gird himself, and place them at table, and will come and wait on them.
042	LUK	012	038	And if in the second, or if in the third watch, he cometh and findeth them thus, happy are they.
042	LUK	012	039	And be sure of this, that if the master of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming, he would not have suffered his house to be broken through.
042	LUK	012	040	Be ye also ready; for at an hour when ye think not the Son of man cometh.
042	LUK	012	041	And Peter said to him, Lord, dost thou speak this parable to us, or also to all?
042	LUK	012	042	And the Lord said, Who then is the faithful, the wise steward, whom his lord will place over his household, to give the portion of food in due season?
042	LUK	012	043	Happy is that servant whom his lord, when he cometh, shall find so doing.
042	LUK	012	044	I say to you in truth, that he will place him in charge of all his substance.
042	LUK	012	045	But if that servant say in his heart, My lord is long in coming; and begin to beat the men-servants and maid-servants, and to eat and drink and be drunken,
042	LUK	012	046	the lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him, and at an hour when he is not aware, and will cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the unfaithful.
042	LUK	012	047	And that servant who knew his lord's will, and did not make ready, nor do according to his will, will be beaten with many stripes;
042	LUK	012	048	but he that knew not and did things worthy of stripes, will be beaten with few. And from every one to whom much hath been given, will much be required; and to whom much hath been entrusted, of him will the more be demanded.
042	LUK	012	049	I came to cast fire upon the earth; and what do I wish, if it hath been already kindled?
042	LUK	012	050	But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how is my soul troubled, till it be accomplished!
042	LUK	012	051	Think ye that I came to give peace in the earth? I tell you, nay, but rather division.
042	LUK	012	052	For from this time forth five in one house will be divided, three against two, and two against three.
042	LUK	012	053	They will be divided, father against son, and son against father; mother against daughter, and daughter against mother; the mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law, and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.
042	LUK	012	054	And he said also to the multitudes, When ye see a cloud rising in the west, ye say at once, A shower is coming; and it is so;
042	LUK	012	055	and when ye perceive the south wind blowing, ye say, It will be hot; and it cometh to pass.
042	LUK	012	056	Hypocrites! ye know how to judge of the face of the earth and the sky; but how is it that ye know not how to judge of this time
042	LUK	012	057	And why even of yourselves do ye not judge what is right?
042	LUK	012	058	When thou art going with thine adversary at law to the magistrate, take pains, while on the way, to be released by him; lest he drag thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and the officer cast thee into prison.
042	LUK	012	059	I tell thee, Thou wilt not come out thence, till thou hast paid the very last mite.
042	LUK	013	001	There were present also at the same time some who told him of the Galilaeans, whose blood Pilate mingled with their sacrifices.
042	LUK	013	002	And he answering said to them, Do ye think that these Galilaeans were sinners above all the Galilaeans, because they have suffered such things?
042	LUK	013	003	I tell you, nay; but unless ye repent, ye will all in like manner perish.
042	LUK	013	004	Or those eighteen, on whom the tower in Siloam fell, and slew them, think ye that they were offenders above all the men that dwell in Jerusalem?
042	LUK	013	005	I tell you, nay; but unless ye repent, ye will all in like manner perish.
042	LUK	013	006	He spoke also this parable: A certain man had a fig-tree planted in his vineyard; and he came seeking fruit thereon, and found none.
042	LUK	013	007	Then said he to the vine-dresser, Lo! three years I have come seeking fruit on this fig-tree, and have found none; cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground?
042	LUK	013	008	And he answering saith to him, Lord, let it alone this year also; till I shall dig about it, and dung it;
042	LUK	013	009	and if it bear fruit hereafter, well; but if not, thou shalt cut it down.
042	LUK	013	010	And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath.
042	LUK	013	011	And lo! there was a woman who had had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years; and she was bent together, and wholly unable to lift herself up.
042	LUK	013	012	And Jesus, seeing her, called to her, and said to her, Woman, thou art set free from thy infirmity.
042	LUK	013	013	And he laid his hands on her; and immediately she stood upright, and gave glory to God.
042	LUK	013	014	But the ruler of the synagogue answering, being filled with indignation because Jesus had performed a cure on the sabbath, said to the multitude, There are six days in which it is proper to work; on those therefore come and be cured, and not on the sabbath-day.
042	LUK	013	015	But the Lord answered him and said, Hypocrites, doth not each of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall, and lead him away and water him?
042	LUK	013	016	And ought not this woman, a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan hath bound, lo! for eighteen years, to be loosed from this bond on the sabbath-day?
042	LUK	013	017	And on his speaking thus, all his adversaries were ashamed; and all the multitude rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him.
042	LUK	013	018	He said therefore, To what is the kingdom of God like? and to what shall I compare it?
042	LUK	013	019	It is like a grain of mustard, which a man took, and cast into his garden; and it grew, and became a tree, and the birds of the air lodged in its branches.
042	LUK	013	020	And again he said, To what shall I liken the kingdom of God?
042	LUK	013	021	It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.
042	LUK	013	022	And he went through the cities and villages, teaching, and journeying towards Jerusalem.
042	LUK	013	023	And one said to him, Lord, are there few that are to be saved? And he said to them,
042	LUK	013	024	Strive to enter in through the narrow door; for many, I say to you, will seek to enter in, and will not be able.
042	LUK	013	025	When once the master of the house shall have risen, and shut the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, open to us, and he answering shall say to you, I know not whence ye are;
042	LUK	013	026	then will ye begin to say, We ate and drank in thy presence, and thou didst teach in our streets.
042	LUK	013	027	And he will say, I tell you, I know not whence ye are; depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity.
042	LUK	013	028	There will be wailing and gnashing of teeth there, when ye see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, and yourselves thrust out.
042	LUK	013	029	And from the east and the west and the north and the south will men come, and take their places at table in the kingdom of God.
042	LUK	013	030	And lo! there are last who will be first, and there are first who will be last.
042	LUK	013	031	In the same hour there came certain Pharisees, saying to him, Depart, and go hence; for Herod designeth to kill thee.
042	LUK	013	032	And he said to them, Go, tell that fox, Lo! I cast out demons and perform cures to-day and to-morrow, and on the third day I make an end.
042	LUK	013	033	But to-day and to-morrow and the next day I must go on; for it cannot be that a prophet should perish out of Jerusalem.
042	LUK	013	034	Jerusalem! Jerusalem! that killeth the prophets, and stoneth those who are sent to her! How often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen gathereth her brood under her wings, and ye would not!
042	LUK	013	035	Lo! your house is abandoned to you. I declare to you, Ye will not see me until the time come when ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.
042	LUK	014	001	And it came to pass, when he had come into the house of one of the chief men of the Pharisees on the sabbath to eat bread, that they were watching him.
042	LUK	014	002	And lo! there was a certain man before him, who had the dropsy.
042	LUK	014	003	And Jesus answering spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, Is it lawful to cure on the sabbath, or not?
042	LUK	014	004	But they were silent. And taking hold of him, he cured him, and sent him away.
042	LUK	014	005	And he answered them and said, Who is there of you, who, if his son or his ox fall into a pit, will not immediately pull him out on the sabbath-day?
042	LUK	014	006	And they could make no answer to this.
042	LUK	014	007	And he spoke a parable to those who were invited, when he observed how they chose out the highest places at the table, saying to them,
042	LUK	014	008	When thou art invited by any one to a wedding, do not take the highest place, lest one more honorable than thou may have been invited by him;
042	LUK	014	009	and he who invited thee and him come and say to thee, Give place to this man; and then thou wilt begin with shame to take the lowest place.
042	LUK	014	010	But when thou art invited, go and recline in the lowest place, that when he who invited thee cometh, he may say to thee, Friend, go up higher. Then wilt thou have honor in the presence of all who are at table with thee.
042	LUK	014	011	For every one that exalteth himself will be humbled; and he that humbleth himself will be exalted.
042	LUK	014	012	And he said also to him who invited him, When thou makest a dinner or a supper, do not invite thy friends, nor thy brothers, nor thy kinsmen, nor rich neighbors; lest they too invite thee in return, and a recompense be made thee.
042	LUK	014	013	But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind;
042	LUK	014	014	and thou shalt be blessed, because they cannot recompense thee; but thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the righteous.
042	LUK	014	015	And one of those who were at table with him, hearing this, said to him, Blessed is he who shall eat bread in the kingdom of God.
042	LUK	014	016	And he said to him, A certain man made a great supper, and invited many.
042	LUK	014	017	And at the hour of supper he sent his servant to say to those who had been invited, Come, for things are now ready.
042	LUK	014	018	And all with one accord began to excuse themselves. The first said to him, I have bought a piece of land, and must needs go out and see it; I pray that I may be excused.
042	LUK	014	019	And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and am going out to try them; I pray that I may be excused.
042	LUK	014	020	And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.
042	LUK	014	021	And the servant came, and reported these things to his lord. Then the master of the house, being angry, said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor, and the maimed, the blind, and the lame.
042	LUK	014	022	And the servant said, Lord, what thou didst command hath been done, and yet there is room.
042	LUK	014	023	And the lord said to the servant, Go out into the highways and hedges, and constrain them to come in, that my house may be filled.
042	LUK	014	024	For I say to you, that none of those men who were invited shall taste of my supper.
042	LUK	014	025	And great multitudes were going with him; and he turned and said to them,
042	LUK	014	026	If any one cometh to me, and hateth not his father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.
042	LUK	014	027	Whoever doth not bear his own cross and follow me, cannot be my disciple.
042	LUK	014	028	For which of you, intending to build a tower, doth not sit down first and count the cost, whether he hath the means to finish it?
042	LUK	014	029	lest haply when he hath laid a foundation, and is not able to finish, all that behold begin to make sport of him,
042	LUK	014	030	saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish.
042	LUK	014	031	Or what king, setting out to give battle to another king, will not first sit down and consider whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand?
042	LUK	014	032	Else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sendeth an embassy, and asketh conditions of peace.
042	LUK	014	033	So likewise, whoever of you doth not forsake all that he hath, cannot be my disciple.
042	LUK	014	034	Salt then is good; but if the salt itself have lost its savor, wherewith shall it be seasoned?
042	LUK	014	035	It is fit neither for the land, nor for the dunghill; men cast it out. He that hath ears, let him hear.
042	LUK	015	001	And all the publicans and the sinners were drawing near to him, to hear him.
042	LUK	015	002	And the Pharisees and the scribes murmured, saying, This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them.
042	LUK	015	003	And he spoke to them this parable, saying,
042	LUK	015	004	What man of you having a hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, doth not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he findeth it?
042	LUK	015	005	And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders, rejoicing.
042	LUK	015	006	And when he hath come home, he calleth together his friends and neighbors, saying to them, Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost.
042	LUK	015	007	I say to you, that in like manner there will be joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety-nine righteous men who have no need of repentance.
042	LUK	015	008	Or what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she lose one piece, doth not light a lamp, and sweep the house, and search carefully till she findeth it?
042	LUK	015	009	And when she hath found it, she calleth together her friends and neighbors, saying, Rejoice with me; for I have found the piece which I lost.
042	LUK	015	010	I say to you, that thus there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth.
042	LUK	015	011	He said also, A certain man had two sons.
042	LUK	015	012	And the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of the property that falleth to me. And he divided to them his living.
042	LUK	015	013	And not many days after, the younger son gathered all together, and went abroad into a far country; and there wasted his substance in riotous living.
042	LUK	015	014	And when he had spent all, there arose a great famine in that country; and he began to be in want.
042	LUK	015	015	And he went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.
042	LUK	015	016	And he longed to fill himself with the husks that the swine ate; and no one gave to him.
042	LUK	015	017	And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish here with hunger!
042	LUK	015	018	I will arise and go to my father, and will say to him, Father, I have sinned against Heaven and before thee;
042	LUK	015	019	I am no longer worthy to be called thy son; make me as one of thy hired servants.
042	LUK	015	020	And he arose, and went to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and was moved with compassion, and ran and fell on his neck, and kissed him.
042	LUK	015	021	And the son said to him, Father, I have sinned against Heaven and before thee; I am no longer worthy to be called thy son.
042	LUK	015	022	But the father said to his servants, Bring out the best robe, and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand, and sandals on his feet.
042	LUK	015	023	And bring the fatted calf; kill it, and let us eat and make merry.
042	LUK	015	024	For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to make merry.
042	LUK	015	025	Now his elder son was in the field; and as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing.
042	LUK	015	026	And calling one of the servants, he inquired what these things meant.
042	LUK	015	027	And he said to him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound.
042	LUK	015	028	But he was angry, and would not go in; and his father came out, and entreated him.
042	LUK	015	029	And he answering said to his father, Lo! for so many years have I served thee, and never transgressed thy command; and yet to me thou never gavest a kid, that I might make merry with my friends.
042	LUK	015	030	But as soon as this thy son came, who devoured thy living with harlots, thou didst kill for him the fatted calf.
042	LUK	015	031	And he said to him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine.
042	LUK	015	032	It was meet that we should make merry and be glad; for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found.
042	LUK	016	001	And he said also to the disciples, There was a certain rich man, who had a steward; and the same was accused to him as wasting his goods.
042	LUK	016	002	And he called him, and said to him, What is this that I hear of thee? Give an account of thy stewardship; for thou canst be no longer steward.
042	LUK	016	003	Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do, now that my lord taketh away from me the stewardship? I cannot dig, I am ashamed to beg.
042	LUK	016	004	I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, I may be received into their houses.
042	LUK	016	005	So he called to him every one of his lord's debtors, and said to the first, How much dost thou owe my lord?
042	LUK	016	006	And he said, A hundred measures of oil. And he said to him, Take thy bond, and sit down quickly, and write fifty.
042	LUK	016	007	Then he said to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, A hundred measures of wheat. He saith to him, Take thy bond, and write eighty.
042	LUK	016	008	And the lord commended the unjust steward for having done wisely; for the sons of this world are wiser toward their generation than the sons of light.
042	LUK	016	009	And I say to you, Make to yourselves friends with the unrighteous mammon; that, when it faileth, ye may be received into everlasting habitations.
042	LUK	016	010	He that is faithful in that which is least, is faithful also in much; and he that is unjust in the least, is unjust also in much.
042	LUK	016	011	If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?
042	LUK	016	012	and if ye have not been faithful in that which is another's, who will give you that which is your own?
042	LUK	016	013	No servant can serve two masters; for either he will hate one, and love the other; or he will cleave to one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.
042	LUK	016	014	And the Pharisees, who were covetous, heard all this, and they derided him.
042	LUK	016	015	And he said to them, Ye are they who justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts; for that which is highly exalted among men is an abomination before God.
042	LUK	016	016	The Law and the Prophets were till John; from that time the glad tidings of the kingdom of God have been published, and every one is forcing his way into it.
042	LUK	016	017	But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away, than for one tittle of the law to fail.
042	LUK	016	018	Whoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery; and he who marrieth a woman that hath been put away from her husband, committeth adultery.
042	LUK	016	019	There was a certain rich man, who was clothed in purple and fine linen, and feasted sumptuously every day.
042	LUK	016	020	And a certain beggar named Lazarus was laid at his gate, full of sores,
042	LUK	016	021	and longing to be fed with what fell from the rich man's table. But even the dogs came and licked his sores.
042	LUK	016	022	And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels to the bosom of Abraham. The rich man also died and was buried.
042	LUK	016	023	And in the underworld he lifted up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.
042	LUK	016	024	And he called and said, Father Abraham, have pity on me, and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.
042	LUK	016	025	But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou didst receive thy good things in thy lifetime, and Lazarus in like manner his evil things; but now he is comforted here, and thou art tormented.
042	LUK	016	026	And besides all this, between us and you there is placed a great gulf, so that those who wish to cross from hence to you may not be able, and that those on that side cannot cross over to us.
042	LUK	016	027	Then he said, I pray thee then, father, to send him to my father's house;
042	LUK	016	028	for I have five brothers; that he may give earnest warning to them, that they too may not come into this place of torment.
042	LUK	016	029	But Abraham saith, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.
042	LUK	016	030	But he said, Nay, father Abraham; but if one should go to them from the dead, they would repent.
042	LUK	016	031	But he said to him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, they will not be persuaded, though one should rise from the dead.
042	LUK	017	001	And he said to his disciples, It is impossible but that stumbling-blocks will come; but woe to him through whom they come!
042	LUK	017	002	It were better for him to have a millstone hung round his neck, and be cast into the sea, than to cause one of these little ones to fall away.
042	LUK	017	003	Take heed to yourselves. If thy brother sin, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him.
042	LUK	017	004	And if he sin against thee seven times in a day, and seven times turn to thee, saying, I repent, thou shalt forgive him.
042	LUK	017	005	And the apostles said to the Lord, Give us more faith.
042	LUK	017	006	But the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard, ye might say to this sycamine-tree, Be plucked up by the roots, and planted in the sea! and it would obey you.
042	LUK	017	007	And which of you having a servant plowing, or feeding cattle, will say to him, when he hath come in from the field, Come immediately and place thyself at table?
042	LUK	017	008	Will he not rather say to him, Make ready wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself and serve me till I have eaten and drunken, and afterward thou shalt eat and drink?
042	LUK	017	009	Doth he owe any thanks to that servant, because he did what was commanded?
042	LUK	017	010	So also do ye, when ye have done all that hath been commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants; we have done what we were bound to do.
042	LUK	017	011	And it came to pass, as he was going to Jerusalem, that he was traveling on the confines of Samaria and Galilee.
042	LUK	017	012	And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten lepers, who stood afar off.
042	LUK	017	013	And they lifted up their voice, saying, Jesus, Master, have pity on us.
042	LUK	017	014	And when he saw them, he said to them, Go, show yourselves to the priests. And it came to pass, that, as they were on their way, they were cleansed.
042	LUK	017	015	And one of them, perceiving that he was freed from his disease, turned back, giving glory to God with a loud voice;
042	LUK	017	016	and he fell down on his face at his feet, giving thanks to him; and he was a Samaritan.
042	LUK	017	017	And Jesus answering said, Were not the ten cleansed? Where are the nine?
042	LUK	017	018	Were there none found returning to give glory to God but this foreigner?
042	LUK	017	019	And he said to him, Rise and go; thy faith hath made thee well.
042	LUK	017	020	And being asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God was coming, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not in such a manner as to be watched for;
042	LUK	017	021	nor will they say, Lo here! or there! for behold, the kingdom of God is in the midst of you.
042	LUK	017	022	And he said to the disciples, The days will come, when ye will desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and will not see it.
042	LUK	017	023	And they will say to you, Lo there! lo here! Go not away, and follow not.
042	LUK	017	024	For as the lightning, that lighteneth out of one part under heaven, shineth to the other part under heaven, so will the Son of man be in his day.
042	LUK	017	025	But first he must suffer much, and be rejected by this generation.
042	LUK	017	026	And as it was in the days of Noah, so will it be also in the days of the Son of man.
042	LUK	017	027	They ate, they drank, they married, they were given in marriage, until the day when Noah entered the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all.
042	LUK	017	028	In like manner, as it was in the days of Lot; they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded;
042	LUK	017	029	but on the day when Lot went out of Sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all.
042	LUK	017	030	Thus will it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.
042	LUK	017	031	In that day, let not him who is upon the house-top, and whose furniture is in the house, come down to take it away; and he that is in the field, let him likewise not turn back.
042	LUK	017	032	Remember Lot's wife.
042	LUK	017	033	Whoever shall seek to save his life will lose it; and whoever shall lose it will preserve it.
042	LUK	017	034	I tell you, In that night there will be two men on one bed; one will be taken, and the other will be left.
042	LUK	017	035	Two women will be grinding together; one will be taken, and the other left.
042	LUK	017	037	And they answering say to him, Where, Lord? And he said to them, Where the body is, there also will the eagles be gathered together.
042	LUK	018	001	And he spoke a parable to them to show that they ought to pray always, and not be faint-hearted:
042	LUK	018	002	saying, There was in a certain city a judge, who feared not God, nor regarded man.
042	LUK	018	003	And there was a widow in that city; and she kept coming to him, saying, Avenge me of my adversary!
042	LUK	018	004	And he would not for some time. But afterward he said within himself, Though I neither fear God, nor regard man,
042	LUK	018	005	yet, because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her; lest by coming for ever she weary me out.
042	LUK	018	006	And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith.
042	LUK	018	007	And will not God avenge his chosen, who cry to him day and night, though he be slow to punish in their behalf?
042	LUK	018	008	I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. But yet, when the Son of man cometh, will he find faith on the earth?
042	LUK	018	009	And to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised all others, he spoke this parable:
042	LUK	018	010	Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.
042	LUK	018	011	The Pharisee stood and prayed by himself thus: O God, I thank thee that I am not as the rest of men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.
042	LUK	018	012	I fast twice in the week; I give tithes of all that I gain.
042	LUK	018	013	But the publican, standing afar off, would not even lift up his eyes to heaven; but smote his breast, saying, O God, be merciful to me a sinner!
042	LUK	018	014	I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other; for every one that exalteth himself will be humbled; but he that humbleth himself will be exalted.
042	LUK	018	015	And they brought to him infants also, that he might touch them; and the disciples, on seeing it, rebuked them.
042	LUK	018	016	But Jesus called them to him, saying, Suffer the little children to come to me, and forbid them not; for to such belongeth the kingdom of God.
042	LUK	018	017	Truly do I say to you, Whoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, will not enter therein.
042	LUK	018	018	And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good teacher, what shall I do to inherit everlasting life?
042	LUK	018	019	And Jesus said to him, Why dost thou call me good? None is good but one, that is, God.
042	LUK	018	020	Thou knowest the commandments: “Do not commit adultery; Do not kill; Do not steal; Do not bear false witness; Honor thy father and thy mother.”
042	LUK	018	021	And he said, All these have I kept from my youth.
042	LUK	018	022	And Jesus hearing this said to him, One thing thou still lackest: sell all that thou hast, and distribute to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.
042	LUK	018	023	But when he heard this, he became very sorrowful; for he was very rich.
042	LUK	018	024	And Jesus seeing him said, How hardly do they that have riches enter the kingdom of God!
042	LUK	018	025	It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.
042	LUK	018	026	And those who heard this said, Who then can be saved?
042	LUK	018	027	But he said, What is impossible with men is possible with God.
042	LUK	018	028	Then Peter said, Lo! we left what we had, and followed thee.
042	LUK	018	029	And he said to them, Truly do I say to you, There is no one that hath left house, or wife, or brothers, or parents, or children, for the sake of the kingdom of God,
042	LUK	018	030	who will not receive many fold more in the present time, and in the world to come everlasting life.
042	LUK	018	031	And taking the twelve aside, he said to them, Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all that hath been written by the prophets concerning the Son of man will be accomplished.
042	LUK	018	032	For he will be delivered up to the gentiles, and will be mocked, and insulted, and spit upon;
042	LUK	018	033	and they will scourge him, and put him to death; and the third day he will rise again.
042	LUK	018	034	And they understood none of these things; and the meaning of these words was hidden from them, and they did not comprehend what was said.
042	LUK	018	035	And it came to pass, as he drew near to Jericho, that a certain blind man was sitting by the wayside begging.
042	LUK	018	036	And hearing a multitude passing by, he asked what this meant.
042	LUK	018	037	And they told him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by.
042	LUK	018	038	And he cried out, saying, Jesus, Son of David, have pity on me!
042	LUK	018	039	And they who went before sharply bade him hold his peace. But he cried out the more, Son of David, have pity on me!
042	LUK	018	040	And Jesus stopped, and ordered him to be brought to him. And when he had come near, he asked him,
042	LUK	018	041	What dost thou wish me to do for thee? And he said, Lord, to restore my sight.
042	LUK	018	042	And Jesus said to him, Receive thy sight; thy faith hath saved thee.
042	LUK	018	043	And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, giving glory to God; and all the people on seeing it gave praise to God.
042	LUK	019	001	And he entered and was passing through Jericho.
042	LUK	019	002	And lo! a man named Zacchaeus; and he was a chief publican, and he was rich.
042	LUK	019	003	And he sought to see Jesus, what sort of man he was; and he could not on account of the multitude; because he was small of stature.
042	LUK	019	004	And he ran on before, and climbed up a sycamore-tree to see him; for he was to pass that way.
042	LUK	019	005	And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and said to him, Zacchaeas, make haste and come down; for today I must abide at thy house.
042	LUK	019	006	And he made haste and came down, and received him joyfully.
042	LUK	019	007	And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, He hath gone in to be the guest of a sinner.
042	LUK	019	008	And Zacchaeus stood up, and said to the Lord, Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken anything from any one by false representation, I restore him four-fold.
042	LUK	019	009	And Jesus said to him, This day hath salvation come to this house, inasmuch as he also is a son of Abraham;
042	LUK	019	010	for the Son of man came to seek and to save that which was lost.
042	LUK	019	011	And while they were hearing these things, he proceeded and spoke a parable, because he was near to Jerusalem, and they thought that the kingdom of God would immediately appear.
042	LUK	019	012	He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.
042	LUK	019	013	And he called his ten servants, and gave them ten pounds, and said to them, Trade with these, till I come.
042	LUK	019	014	But his citizens hated him, and sent an embassy after him, saying, We will not have this man to reign over us.
042	LUK	019	015	And it came to pass, when he had returned, having received the kingdom, that he commanded these servants to whom he had given the money to be called to him, that he might know what each had gained by trading.
042	LUK	019	016	And the first came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten pounds.
042	LUK	019	017	And he said to him, Well done, good servant! because thou hast been faithful in a very little, have authority over ten cities.
042	LUK	019	018	And the second came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained five pounds.
042	LUK	019	019	And he said also to this servant, And be thou over five cities.
042	LUK	019	020	And another came, saying, Lord, behold thy pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin.
042	LUK	019	021	For I feared thee, because thou art a harsh man; thou takest up what thou didst not lay down, and reapest what thou didst not sow.
042	LUK	019	022	He saith to him, Out of thy mouth will I judge thee, wicked servant! thou knewest that I was a harsh man, taking up what I laid not down, and reaping what I did not sow;
042	LUK	019	023	why then didst thou not put my money into a bank? Then I at my coming might have received it back with interest.
042	LUK	019	024	And he said to them that stood by, Take from him the pound, and give it to him that hath the ten pounds.
042	LUK	019	025	(And they said to him, He hath ten pounds, Lord.)
042	LUK	019	026	I say to you, that to every one who hath, will be given; but from him that hath not, even what he hath will be taken away.
042	LUK	019	027	But as for those enemies of mine, who would not that I should reign over them, bring them here, and slay them before me.
042	LUK	019	028	And when he had thus spoken, he went forward, going up to Jerusalem.
042	LUK	019	029	And it came to pass, as he drew near to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,
042	LUK	019	030	saying, Go to the village over against us; on entering which ye will find a colt tied, whereon no man ever sat; and loose, and bring it.
042	LUK	019	031	And if any one ask you, Why are ye loosing it? ye shall say thus, The Lord hath need of it.
042	LUK	019	032	And they who were sent went and found just as he told them.
042	LUK	019	033	And as they were loosing the colt, its owners said to them, Why are ye loosing the colt?
042	LUK	019	034	And they said, The Lord hath need of it.
042	LUK	019	035	And they brought it to Jesus; and having thrown their garments on the colt, they set Jesus thereon.
042	LUK	019	036	And as he went on, they spread their garments in the road.
042	LUK	019	037	And as he was drawing near, just at the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the miracles which they had seen;
042	LUK	019	038	saying, Blessed be the King in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven, and glory in the highest heavens!
042	LUK	019	039	And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said to him, Teacher, rebuke thy disciples.
042	LUK	019	040	And he answering said, I tell you, that if these are silent, the stones will cry out.
042	LUK	019	041	And when he came near, as he beheld the city, he wept over it,
042	LUK	019	042	saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, and that in this thy day, the things that concern thy peace! but now they are hidden from thine eyes.
042	LUK	019	043	For the days will come upon thee, when thine enemies will cast up a mound about thee, and compass thee round, and shut thee in on every side,
042	LUK	019	044	and will level thee with the ground, and thy children within thee; and they will not leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.
042	LUK	019	045	And entering the temple, he began to cast out those who sold,
042	LUK	019	046	saying to them, It is written, “And my house shall be a house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of robbers.”
042	LUK	019	047	And he was teaching daily in the temple; but the chief priests, and the scribes, and the leading men of the people sought to destroy him.
042	LUK	019	048	And they could not find an opportunity of doing any thing; for all the people hung upon him, listening.
042	LUK	020	001	And it came to pass, on one of those days, as he was teaching the people in the temple, and publishing the good tidings, that the priests and the scribes with the elders came upon him,
042	LUK	020	002	and spoke to him, saying, Tell us, by what authority doest thou these things? Or who is he that gave thee this authority?
042	LUK	020	003	And he answering said to them, I also will ask you a question; and tell me:
042	LUK	020	004	The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or from men?
042	LUK	020	005	And they reasoned among themselves, saying, If we say, From heaven, he will say, Why did ye not believe him?
042	LUK	020	006	But if we say, From men, all the people will stone us; for they are persuaded that John was a prophet.
042	LUK	020	007	And they answered, that they did not know whence it was.
042	LUK	020	008	And Jesus said to them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.
042	LUK	020	009	And he began to speak to the people this parable: A man planted a vineyard, and let it out to husbandmen, and went abroad for a long time.
042	LUK	020	010	And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard; but the husbandmen beat him, and sent him away empty-handed.
042	LUK	020	011	And he sent still another servant; and they beat him also, and treated him shamefully, and sent him away empty-handed.
042	LUK	020	012	And he went on to send a third; and they wounded him also, and cast him out.
042	LUK	020	013	And the lord of the vineyard said, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son; perhaps they will respect him.
042	LUK	020	014	But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir; let us kill him, that the inheritance may become ours.
042	LUK	020	015	So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What then will the lord of the vineyard do to them?
042	LUK	020	016	He will come and destroy these husbandmen, and will give the vineyard to others. And when they heard this, they said, God forbid!
042	LUK	020	017	But he, looking upon them, said, What then is this which is written, “The stone which the builders rejected, the same hath become the corner-stone”?
042	LUK	020	018	Every one who falleth upon that stone will be broken; but on whomever it falleth, it will grind him to powder.
042	LUK	020	019	And the scribes and the chief priests sought to lay hands on him in that hour, but they feared the people; for they knew that he spoke this parable against them.
042	LUK	020	020	And they kept watch on him, and sent forth spies feigning themselves to be righteous men, that they might take hold of his words, in order to deliver him up to the civil power and to the authority of the governor.
042	LUK	020	021	And they asked him, saying, Teacher, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, and hast no regard to the person of men, but teachest the way of God truly.
042	LUK	020	022	Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Caesar, or not?
042	LUK	020	023	But perceiving their craftiness, he said to them,
042	LUK	020	024	Show me a denary. Whose image and inscription hath it? And they answered and said, Caesar's.
042	LUK	020	025	And he said to them, Render then to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.
042	LUK	020	026	And they could not take hold of his words before the people; and marveling at his answer, they held their peace.
042	LUK	020	027	Then some of the Sadducees, who deny that there is a resurrection, came to him, and asked him,
042	LUK	020	028	saying, Teacher, Moses wrote to us, “If a man's brother die, having a wife, and the same die without children, his brother shall take his wife, and raise up seed to his brother.”
042	LUK	020	029	Now there were seven brothers; and the first took a wife and died childless.
042	LUK	020	030	And the second
042	LUK	020	031	and the third took her; and in like manner also the seven left no children, and died.
042	LUK	020	032	At last the woman also died.
042	LUK	020	033	In the resurrection then, of which of them is the woman the wife? for the seven had her for a wife.
042	LUK	020	034	And Jesus said to them, The sons of this world marry, and are given in marriage;
042	LUK	020	035	but they who have been accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage;
042	LUK	020	036	for they cannot die any more; for they are like the angels, and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection.
042	LUK	020	037	But that the dead are raised, even Moses hath shown at the Bush, when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.
042	LUK	020	038	Now he is not a God of the dead, but of the living; for all live to him.
042	LUK	020	039	Then some of the scribes answering, said, Teacher, thou hast well said.
042	LUK	020	040	For they dared no longer to ask him any question.
042	LUK	020	041	And he said to them, How is it that men say that the Christ is David's son?
042	LUK	020	042	For David himself saith in the book of Psalms, “The Lord said to my lord, Sit thou on my right hand,
042	LUK	020	043	till I make thine enemies thy footstool.”
042	LUK	020	044	David then calleth him lord; and how is he his son?
042	LUK	020	045	And in the hearing of all the people he said to his disciples,
042	LUK	020	046	Beware of the scribes, who like to walk about in long robes, and love salutations in the markets, and the chief seats in the synagogues, and the first places at feasts;
042	LUK	020	047	who devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayers. These will receive a far greater condemnation.
042	LUK	021	001	And he looked up and saw the rich men casting their gifts into the treasury.
042	LUK	021	002	And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites.
042	LUK	021	003	And he said, In truth I say to you, that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all.
042	LUK	021	004	For all these out of their abundance cast in to the offerings; but she out of her penury cast in all the living that she had.
042	LUK	021	005	And as some were saying of the temple, that it was adorned with goodly stones, and sacred gifts, he said,
042	LUK	021	006	As for these things which ye behold, the days will come, in which there will not be left here one stone upon another, that will not be throw down.
042	LUK	021	007	And they asked him, saying, Teacher, when then will these things be? and what will be the sign when these things are about to come to pass?
042	LUK	021	008	And he said, Take heed that ye be not deceived. For many will come in my name, saying, I am He, and the time is at hand. Go not after them.
042	LUK	021	009	And when ye hear of wars and tumults, be not terrified; for these things must first come to pass; but not immediately is the end.
042	LUK	021	010	Then he said to them, Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom;
042	LUK	021	011	and there will be great earthquakes, and in divers places famines and pestilences; and there will be fearful sights and great signs from heaven.
042	LUK	021	012	But before all these things they will lay their hands on you and persecute you, delivering you up to synagogues, and into prisons, and bringing you before kings and governors on account of my name.
042	LUK	021	013	It will turn out to you an opportunity for bearing testimony.
042	LUK	021	014	Settle it therefore in your hearts not to meditate l beforehand what ye shall answer.
042	LUK	021	015	For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries will not be able to withstand or gainsay.
042	LUK	021	016	And ye will be delivered up both by parents and brothers and kinsmen and friends; and some of you will they put to death.
042	LUK	021	017	And ye will be hated by all on account of my name.
042	LUK	021	018	But not a hair of your head will be lost.
042	LUK	021	019	By your constancy secure your lives.
042	LUK	021	020	But when ye see Jerusalem encompassed by armies, then know that her desolation is at hand.
042	LUK	021	021	Then let those who are in Judaea flee to the mountains; and let those who are within the city go out of it, and let not those in the open country enter it.
042	LUK	021	022	For these are days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled.
042	LUK	021	023	But woe to the women with child, and to those having children at the breast, in those days! For there will be great distress in the land, and wrath upon this people;
042	LUK	021	024	and they will fall by the edge of the sword, and will be led away captive into all the nations; and Jerusalem will be trodden down by the gentiles, until the times of the gentiles are fulfilled.
042	LUK	021	025	And there will be signs in the sun and moon and stars; and on the earth distress of nations, in perplexity at the roaring of the sea and waves;
042	LUK	021	026	men's hearts failing them from fear, and from looking for those things which are coming on the world; for the powers of the heavens will be shaken.
042	LUK	021	027	And then will they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.
042	LUK	021	028	And when these things begin to come to pass, look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh.
042	LUK	021	029	And he spoke to them a parable: Behold the fig-tree and all the trees;
042	LUK	021	030	when they have already shot forth, ye see it, and know of yourselves that summer is now nigh at hand.
042	LUK	021	031	So also, when ye see these things coming to pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand.
042	LUK	021	032	Truly do I say to you, that this generation will not pass away, till all shall have taken place.
042	LUK	021	033	Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.
042	LUK	021	034	But take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be weighed down with surfeiting and drunkenness and worldly cares, and that day come upon you unawares.
042	LUK	021	035	For as a snare will it come on all that dwell on the face of the whole earth.
042	LUK	021	036	But watch at all times, and pray that ye may be able to escape all the things that are about to come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.
042	LUK	021	037	And during the daytime he was teaching in the temple; but at night he went out, and lodged in the mount called the Mount of Olives.
042	LUK	021	038	And all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple, to hear him.
042	LUK	022	001	Now the feast of unleavened bread, which is called the passover, was drawing near;
042	LUK	022	002	and the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how they might kill him; for they feared the people.
042	LUK	022	003	And Satan entered into Judas called Iscariot, who was of the number of the twelve.
042	LUK	022	004	And he went away, and consulted with the chief priests and captains, how he might deliver him up to them.
042	LUK	022	005	And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money.
042	LUK	022	006	And he agreed with them, and sought a good opportunity to deliver him up to them in the absence of the multitude.
042	LUK	022	007	Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover must be killed;
042	LUK	022	008	and he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and make ready for us the passover, that we may eat it.
042	LUK	022	009	And they said to him, Where wilt thou that we make it ready?
042	LUK	022	010	And he said to them, Lo! when ye have entered the city, there will meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the house where he goeth in;
042	LUK	022	011	and ye shall say to the master of the house, The Teacher saith to thee, Where is the guest-chamber, where I may eat the passover with my disciples?
042	LUK	022	012	And he will show you a large upper room furnished; there make ready.
042	LUK	022	013	And they went and found as he had said to them; and they made ready the passover.
042	LUK	022	014	And when the hour had come, he placed himself at table, and the apostles with him.
042	LUK	022	015	And he said to them, Earnestly have I desired to eat this passover with you, before I suffer.
042	LUK	022	016	For I say to you, that I shall eat it no more, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.
042	LUK	022	017	And he took a cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves.
042	LUK	022	018	For I say to you, that I shall not drink henceforth of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall have come.
042	LUK	022	019	And he took a loaf, and gave thanks, and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, This is my body, which is given for you; this do in remembrance of me.
042	LUK	022	020	And in like manner he took the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is about to be shed for you.
042	LUK	022	021	But lo! the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table.
042	LUK	022	022	For the Son of man indeed goeth away, as it hath been determined; but woe to that man by whom he is betrayed.
042	LUK	022	023	And they began to inquire among themselves, which of them it was that was about to do this.
042	LUK	022	024	And there arose also a contention among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest.
042	LUK	022	025	And he said to them, The kings of the nations rule as lords over them, and they who exercise authority over them are called benefactors.
042	LUK	022	026	But it is not to be so with you; but let the greatest among you be as the youngest; and he that is chief, as he that serveth.
042	LUK	022	027	For which is greater? he who reclineth at the table, or he who serveth? Is not he that reclineth at the table? But I am in the midst of you as he who serveth.
042	LUK	022	028	Ye however are they who have continued steadfastly with me in my trials.
042	LUK	022	029	And I appoint to you a kingdom, as my Father appointed to me;
042	LUK	022	030	that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom; and ye shall sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
042	LUK	022	031	Simon, Simon, lo! Satan hath asked for you, that he may sift you as wheat.
042	LUK	022	032	But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not. And do thou, when thou hast returned to me, strengthen thy brethren.
042	LUK	022	033	And he said to him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee both to prison and to death.
042	LUK	022	034	And he said, I tell thee, Peter, a cock will not crow this day, till thou hast thrice denied that thou knowest me.
042	LUK	022	035	And he said to them, When I sent you without purse, or bag, or sandals, were ye in need of anything? And they said, Of nothing. Then he said to them,
042	LUK	022	036	But now, he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise a bag; and he that hath not, let him sell his garment, and buy a sword.
042	LUK	022	037	For I say to you, that this which is written must be accomplished in me: “And he was reckoned among transgressors.” For that which concerneth me also hath an end.
042	LUK	022	038	And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said to him, It is enough!
042	LUK	022	039	And going out, he went, as he was wont, to the Mount of Olives; and the disciples followed him.
042	LUK	022	040	And when he was at the place, he said to them, Pray that ye may not enter into temptation.
042	LUK	022	041	And he withdrew from them about a stone's throw; and kneeling down he prayed,
042	LUK	022	042	saying, Father, if thou art willing to remove this cup from me—yet not my will, but thine be done!
042	LUK	022	043	And there appeared to him an angel from heaven, strengthening him.
042	LUK	022	044	And being in an agony, he prayed more earnestly. And his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling to the ground.
042	LUK	022	045	And rising up from prayer, he came to the disciples, and found them sleeping for sorrow,
042	LUK	022	046	and said to them, Why sleep ye? Rise, and pray that ye may not enter into temptation.
042	LUK	022	047	While he was yet speaking, lo! a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, was at the head of them; and he drew near to Jesus to kiss him.
042	LUK	022	048	But Jesus said to him, Judas, dost thou betray the Son of man with a kiss?
042	LUK	022	049	And they who were about him, seeing what would follow, said, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?
042	LUK	022	050	And one of them smote the servant of the high-priest, and cut off his right ear.
042	LUK	022	051	But Jesus answering said, Permit thus far; and touched his ear, and healed him.
042	LUK	022	052	Then Jesus said to the chief priests and captains of the temple and elders who had come to him, Ye have come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs;
042	LUK	022	053	when I was daily with you in the temple, ye did not put forth your hands against me; but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.
042	LUK	022	054	And they seized him, and led him away, and brought him into the house of the high-priest. And Peter followed afar off.
042	LUK	022	055	And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the court, and had sat down together, Peter sat down among them.
042	LUK	022	056	But a certain maid-servant saw him sitting at the fire, and steadily looking at him said, This man also was with him.
042	LUK	022	057	And he denied him, saying, Woman, I do not know him.
042	LUK	022	058	And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou also art one of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not.
042	LUK	022	059	And in about one hour's time, another confidently affirmed, saying, In truth this man also was with him; for he is a Galilaean.
042	LUK	022	060	And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he was yet speaking, a cock crew.
042	LUK	022	061	And the Lord turned and looked upon Peter; and Peter remembered the word of the Lord, that he had said to him, Before a cock crows this day, thou wilt thrice deny me.
042	LUK	022	062	And he went out, and wept bitterly.
042	LUK	022	063	And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and beat him;
042	LUK	022	064	and having blindfolded him, they asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that struck thee?
042	LUK	022	065	And many other things did they scoffingly say against him.
042	LUK	022	066	And when it was day, the elders of the people, both chief priests and scribes, came together, and brought him before their council, saying,
042	LUK	022	067	If thou art the Christ, tell us. And he said to them, If I tell you, ye will not believe;
042	LUK	022	068	and if I ask, ye will not answer.
042	LUK	022	069	But from this time the Son of man will sit on the right hand of the power of God.
042	LUK	022	070	Then they all said, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said to them, Ye say what is true; for I am.
042	LUK	022	071	And they said, What further need have we of testimony? For we have ourselves heard from his own mouth.
042	LUK	023	001	And the whole assemblage of them arose, and carried him before Pilate.
042	LUK	023	002	And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this man perverting our nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, and saying that he himself is the Christ, the king.
042	LUK	023	003	And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the king of the Jews? And he answering said to him, I am.
042	LUK	023	004	And Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowd, I find nothing criminal in this man.
042	LUK	023	005	But they were the more violent, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Judaea, beginning from Galilee, even to this place.
042	LUK	023	006	And when Pilate heard this, he asked whether the man was a Galilaean.
042	LUK	023	007	And on learning that he belonged to Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was himself also at Jerusalem at this time.
042	LUK	023	008	Now Herod, when he saw Jesus, was very glad; for he had been wishing to see him for a long time, because he had heard about him; and he hoped to see some sign wrought by him.
042	LUK	023	009	And he put many questions to him; but he gave him no answer.
042	LUK	023	010	And the chief priests and scribes stood vehemently accusing him.
042	LUK	023	011	And Herod also with his guard of soldiers set him at nought and mocked him, and having arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, sent him back to Pilate.
042	LUK	023	012	And Herod and Pilate on that day became friends with each other; for they had before been at enmity.
042	LUK	023	013	And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,
042	LUK	023	014	said to them, Ye have brought to me this man, as one that perverteth the people; and behold, I have examined him before you, and have found nothing in this man to sustain the charges which ye bring against him.
042	LUK	023	015	No, nor yet Herod; for he hath sent him back to us; and lo! nothing deserving death hath been done by him.
042	LUK	023	016	I will therefore chastise, and release him.
042	LUK	023	017	Now it was necessary for him to release to them one at the feast.
042	LUK	023	018	And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man, and release to us Barabbas;
042	LUK	023	019	who, for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, had been cast into prison.
042	LUK	023	020	But Pilate again spoke to them, wishing to release Jesus.
042	LUK	023	021	But they cried out, saying, Crucify, crucify him!
042	LUK	023	022	And he said to them the third time, Why, what evil hath this man done? I have found him guilty of nothing deserving death; I will therefore chastise, and release him.
042	LUK	023	023	But they were urgent with loud voices, demanding that he should he crucified; and their voices prevailed.
042	LUK	023	024	And Pilate gave sentence that what they demanded should be done.
042	LUK	023	025	And he released him who for sedition and murder had been cast into prison, whom they asked for; but Jesus he delivered up to their will.
042	LUK	023	026	And when they had led him away, they laid hold on one Simon a Cyrenaean, coming out of the country, and laid on him the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus.
042	LUK	023	027	And there followed him a great multitude of the people, and of women who were bewailing and lamenting him.
042	LUK	023	028	But Jesus turning to them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me; but weep for yourselves, and for your children.
042	LUK	023	029	For lo! the days are coming, in which they will say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never gave nourishment.
042	LUK	023	030	Then will they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.
042	LUK	023	031	For if they do these things in the green tree, what will be done in the dry?
042	LUK	023	032	And two others, who were malefactors, were led with him to be put to death.
042	LUK	023	033	And when they had come to the place which is called the Skull, they there crucified him, and the malefactors; one on the right hand, and the other on the left.
042	LUK	023	034	And Jesus said, Father, forgive them! for they know not what they do. And they divided his garments, casting lots.
042	LUK	023	035	And the people stood looking on; and the rulers sneered, saying, Others he saved; let him save himself, if this is the Christ of God, the chosen one.
042	LUK	023	036	And the soldiers also came up to him and made sport of him, offering him vinegar,
042	LUK	023	037	and saying, If thou art the king of the Jews, save thyself.
042	LUK	023	038	There was also an inscription over him: “This is the king of the Jews.”
042	LUK	023	039	And one of the crucified malefactors railed at him, saying, Art thou not the Christ? save thyself and us.
042	LUK	023	040	But the other answering said, rebuking him, Dost not thou fear God, since thou art in the same condemnation?
042	LUK	023	041	And we indeed justly; for we are receiving the due reward of our deeds; but this man hath done nothing amiss.
042	LUK	023	042	And he said, Jesus, remember me when thou comest in thy kingdom.
042	LUK	023	043	And he said to him, Truly do I say to thee, Today shalt thou be with me in Paradise.
042	LUK	023	044	And it was now about the sixth hour, and there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour,
042	LUK	023	045	the sun having failed; and the veil of the temple was rent in two.
042	LUK	023	046	And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit! And having said this, he expired.
042	LUK	023	047	And the centurion, seeing what was done, gave glory to God, saying, Surely this was a righteous man.
042	LUK	023	048	And all the multitudes that had come together to that sight, when they had seen the things which were done, returned, beating their breasts.
042	LUK	023	049	And all his acquaintances stood at a distance, and women that came with him from Galilee, beholding these things.
042	LUK	023	050	And lo! a man named Joseph, of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews, being a councilor, and a good and righteous man,
042	LUK	023	051	who was not consenting to their purpose and deed, and was waiting for the kingdom of God, —
042	LUK	023	052	this man went to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus.
042	LUK	023	053	And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a tomb that was hewn out of the rock; wherein no one had yet lain.
042	LUK	023	054	And it was the day of preparation, and the sabbath was now coming on.
042	LUK	023	055	And the women also, who had come with him from Galilee, followed after, and saw the tomb, and how his body was laid.
042	LUK	023	056	And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and on the sabbath they rested, according to the commandment.
042	LUK	024	001	Now on the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came to the tomb, bringing the spices which they had prepared.
042	LUK	024	002	And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb;
042	LUK	024	003	and on entering they found not the body of the Lord Jesus.
042	LUK	024	004	And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed about this, lo! two men stood by them in glittering apparel;
042	LUK	024	005	and when they were terrified, and bowed their faces to the earth, the men said to them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?
042	LUK	024	006	He is not here, but hath risen. Remember how be spoke to you while yet in Galilee,
042	LUK	024	007	saying, The Son of man must be delivered up into the hands of sinners, and be crucified, and rise again on the third day.
042	LUK	024	008	And they remembered his words.
042	LUK	024	009	And returning from the tomb, they told all these things to the eleven, and to all the rest.
042	LUK	024	010	It was Mary the Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James; and the other women with them told these things to the apostles.
042	LUK	024	011	And these words seemed to them as an idle tale, and they did not believe them.
042	LUK	024	013	And lo! two of them were going the same day to a village called Emmaus, distant a hundred and sixty furlongs from Jerusalem.
042	LUK	024	014	And they were conversing together about all those things which had taken place.
042	LUK	024	015	And it came to pass, while they were conversing and reasoning, that Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.
042	LUK	024	016	But their eyes were restrained from knowing him.
042	LUK	024	017	And he said to them, What discourse is this which ye have one with another, as ye are walking? And they stood sad.
042	LUK	024	018	And one, whose name was Cleopas, answering said to him, Art thou the only sojourner in Jerusalem that doth not know the things which have come to pass there in these days?
042	LUK	024	019	And he said to them, What things? And they said to him, The things relating to Jesus the Nazarene, who was a prophet mighty in word and deed before God and all the people;
042	LUK	024	020	and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him.
042	LUK	024	021	But we are hoping that it is he who is to redeem Israel; moreover, besides all this, it is the third day since these things were done.
042	LUK	024	022	And furthermore certain women of our company have amazed us; for going early to the tomb,
042	LUK	024	023	they did not find his body, and came, saying that they had even seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive.
042	LUK	024	024	And some of those who were with us went to the tomb, and found it to be as the women had said; but him they saw not.
042	LUK	024	025	And he said to them, O dull of apprehension, and slow of heart to believe all that the Prophets have spoken!
042	LUK	024	026	Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things, and enter into his glory?
042	LUK	024	027	And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets he explained to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself.
042	LUK	024	028	And they drew near to the village whither they were going; and he made as though he would go further.
042	LUK	024	029	But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us, for it is towards evening, and the day is now far spent. And he went in to stay with them.
042	LUK	024	030	And it came to pass, as he was at table with them, that he took the bread, and blessed it, and broke and gave it to them.
042	LUK	024	031	And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.
042	LUK	024	032	And they said one to another, Did not our hearts burn within us while he talked with us on the way, while he opened to us the Scriptures?
042	LUK	024	033	And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem; and they found the eleven and those who were with them gathered together,
042	LUK	024	034	saying, The Lord hath risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.
042	LUK	024	035	And they told what had happened on the way, and how he became known to them in the breaking of the bread.
042	LUK	024	036	And while they were thus speaking, he himself stood in the midst of them.
042	LUK	024	037	But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they beheld a spirit.
042	LUK	024	038	And he said to them, Why are ye troubled? and why do doubts arise in your hearts?
042	LUK	024	039	See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself. Handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.
042	LUK	024	041	And while they still disbelieved for joy, and wondered, he said to them, Have ye anything here to eat?
042	LUK	024	042	And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish.
042	LUK	024	043	And he took and ate it before them.
042	LUK	024	044	And he said to them, These are my words which I spoke to you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled which are written in the Law of Moses, and the Prophets, and the Psalms, concerning me.
042	LUK	024	045	Then he opened their understanding, that they might understand the Scriptures.
042	LUK	024	046	And he said to them, Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer, and should rise from the dead on the third day,
042	LUK	024	047	and that repentance for the remission of sins should be preached in his name among all the nations, beginning at Jerusalem.
042	LUK	024	048	Ye are witnesses of these things.
042	LUK	024	049	And I send forth upon you that which hath been promised by my Father; but do ye tarry in the city, until ye are endued with power from on high.
042	LUK	024	050	And he led them out as far as to Bethany; and he lifted up his hands and blessed them.
042	LUK	024	051	And it came to pass, while he blessed them, that he parted from them.
042	LUK	024	052	And they returned to Jerusalem with great joy,
042	LUK	024	053	and were continually in the temple, praising God.

# BOOK	043	JOH	John	John
043	JOH	001	001	In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
043	JOH	001	002	The same was in the beginning with God.
043	JOH	001	003	All things were made through him; and without him was nothing made that hath been made.
043	JOH	001	004	In him is life; and the life was the light of men.
043	JOH	001	005	And the light hath been shining in the darkness; and the darkness received it not.
043	JOH	001	006	There was a man, sent from God, whose name was John.
043	JOH	001	007	He came as a witness, to bear witness of the light, that through him all might believe.
043	JOH	001	008	He was not the light, but came to bear witness of the light.
043	JOH	001	009	The true light, which enlighteneth every man, was coming into the world.
043	JOH	001	010	He was in the world, and the world was made through him, and the world knew him not.
043	JOH	001	011	He came to his own, and his own received him not.
043	JOH	001	012	But as many as received him, to them he gave power to become children of God, —to those who believed in his name;
043	JOH	001	013	who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.
043	JOH	001	014	And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us, full of grace and truth; and we beheld his glory, a glory as of an only begotten of a father.
043	JOH	001	015	John beareth witness of him, and crieth, saying, This was he of whom I said, He that cometh after me hath gone before me; for he was before me.
043	JOH	001	016	For out of his fullness have we all received, and grace upon grace.
043	JOH	001	017	For the Law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.
043	JOH	001	018	No one hath ever seen God; the only begotten God, who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath made him known.
043	JOH	001	019	And this is the witness of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem, to ask him, Who art thou?
043	JOH	001	020	And he declared, and did not deny; and he declared, I am not the Christ.
043	JOH	001	021	And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elijah? And he said, I am not. Art thou the prophet? And he answered, No.
043	JOH	001	022	They said therefore to him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to those who sent us; what sayest thou of thyself?
043	JOH	001	023	He said, I am “a voice of one crying aloud in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord,” as said Isaiah the prophet.
043	JOH	001	024	And they were sent from the Pharisees;
043	JOH	001	025	and they asked him and said to him, Why then dost thou baptize, if thou art not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the prophet?
043	JOH	001	026	John answered them, saying, I baptize in water. There standeth one among you whom ye know not,
043	JOH	001	027	he who cometh after me, the latchet of whose sandal I am not worthy to loose.
043	JOH	001	028	These things took place in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.
043	JOH	001	029	The next day he seeth Jesus coming to him, and saith, Behold, the Lamb of God, who taketh away the sin of the world!
043	JOH	001	030	This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man, who hath gone before me; for he was before me.
043	JOH	001	031	And I knew him not; but that he might be made manifest to Israel, therefore I came baptizing in water.
043	JOH	001	032	And John bore witness, saying, I have seen the Spirit descending as a dove from heaven, and it abode upon him.
043	JOH	001	033	And I knew him not; but he who sent me to baptize in water, the same said to me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding on him, he it is that baptizeth in the Holy Spirit.
043	JOH	001	034	And I have seen and have borne witness, that this is the Son of God.
043	JOH	001	035	On the morrow John was again standing, and two of his disciples;
043	JOH	001	036	and looking upon Jesus as he was walking, he saith, Behold, the Lamb of God!
043	JOH	001	037	The two disciples heard him speaking, and they followed Jesus.
043	JOH	001	038	Jesus turning and seeing them following, saith to them, What seek ye? And they said to him, Rabbi, (that is to say, when interpreted, Teacher, ) where dost thou dwell?
043	JOH	001	039	He saith to them, Come, and ye shall see. They came therefore and saw where he dwelt; and they abode with him that day. It was about the tenth hour.
043	JOH	001	040	One of the two who heard what John said, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.
043	JOH	001	041	He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith to him, We have found the Messiah; (which is, when interpreted, the Christ.)
043	JOH	001	042	He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looking upon him said, Thou art Simon, the son of John; thou shalt be called Cephas; (which signifieth Peter, that is, Rock.)
043	JOH	001	043	On the morrow he determined to go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip. And Jesus saith to him, Follow me.
043	JOH	001	044	Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.
043	JOH	001	045	Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith to him, We have found him of whom Moses in the Law, and the Prophets wrote, Jesus, the son of Joseph, who is of Nazareth.
043	JOH	001	046	And Nathanael said to him, Can any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith to him, Come and see.
043	JOH	001	047	Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile.
043	JOH	001	048	Nathanael saith to him, Whence dost thou know me? Jesus answered and said to him, Before Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig-tree, I saw thee.
043	JOH	001	049	Nathanael answered him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God, thou art the king of Israel.
043	JOH	001	050	Jesus answered and said to him, Because I said to thee, I saw thee under the fig-tree, dost thou believe? Thou shalt see greater things than these.
043	JOH	001	051	And he saith to him, Truly, truly do I say to you, Ye will see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.
043	JOH	002	001	And on the third day there was a marriage-feast in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there.
043	JOH	002	002	And both Jesus and his disciples were invited to the feast.
043	JOH	002	003	And they had no wine, because the wine of the feast had failed. Then the mother of Jesus saith to him, There is no wine.
043	JOH	002	004	Jesus saith to her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? My hour is not yet come.
043	JOH	002	005	His mother saith to the servants, Whatever he saith to you, do it.
043	JOH	002	006	Now there were set there six water-pots of stone, in conformity with the Jews' custom of purifying, containing two or three firkins apiece.
043	JOH	002	007	Jesus saith to them, Fill the water-pots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.
043	JOH	002	008	And he saith to them, Draw out now, and bear it to the master of the feast. And they bore it.
043	JOH	002	009	But when the master of the feast tasted the water that had been made wine, not knowing whence it was, but the servants who drew the water knew, he called the bridegroom
043	JOH	002	010	and said to him, Every man setteth on the good wine first, and when men have drunk freely, that which is worse. Thou hast kept the good wine until now.
043	JOH	002	011	This beginning of the signs Jesus made in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his glory; and his disciples believed in him.
043	JOH	002	012	After this he went down to Capernaum, he and his mother, and his brothers, and his disciples; and they abode there not many days.
043	JOH	002	013	And the passover of the Jews was near; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
043	JOH	002	014	And he found in the temple those who sold oxen, and sheep, and doves, and the money-changers sitting.
043	JOH	002	015	And having made a scourge of cords, he drove them all out of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen; and poured out the money of the exchangers, and overthrew the tables;
043	JOH	002	016	and said to those who sold the doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house a house of merchandise.
043	JOH	002	017	His disciples remembered that it was written, “Zeal for thy house will consume me.”
043	JOH	002	018	The Jews therefore answered and said to him, What sign dost thou show us, seeing thou doest these things?
043	JOH	002	019	Jesus answered and said to them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.
043	JOH	002	020	Then said the Jews, Forty-six years was this temple in building; and wilt thou raise it up in three days?
043	JOH	002	021	But he spoke of the temple of his body.
043	JOH	002	022	When therefore he had risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this; and they believed the Scripture, and the word which Jesus had spoken.
043	JOH	002	023	And when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, at the feast, many believed in his name, when they saw his signs which he wrought.
043	JOH	002	024	But Jesus did not trust himself to them, because he knew all men;
043	JOH	002	025	and had no need that any one should testify concerning man; for he himself knew what was in man.
043	JOH	003	001	And there was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.
043	JOH	003	002	This man came to him by night, and said to him, Rabbi, we know that thou hast come as a teacher from God; for no one can do these signs which thou doest, unless God be with him.
043	JOH	003	003	Jesus answered and said to him, Truly, truly do I say to thee, Unless a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.
043	JOH	003	004	Nicodemus saith to him, How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter his mother's womb a second time, and be born?
043	JOH	003	005	Jesus answered, Truly, truly do I say to thee, Unless a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of heaven.
043	JOH	003	006	That which is born of the flesh, is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit, is spirit.
043	JOH	003	007	Marvel not that I said to thee, Ye must be born again.
043	JOH	003	008	The wind bloweth where it will; and thou hearest the sound thereof, but knowest not whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.
043	JOH	003	009	Nicodemus answered and said to him, How can these things be?
043	JOH	003	010	Jesus answered and said to him, Art thou the teacher of Israel, and understandest not these things?
043	JOH	003	011	Truly, truly do I say to thee, We speak that which we know, and testify that which we have seen; and ye receive not our testimony.
043	JOH	003	012	If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how will ye believe if I tell you heavenly things?
043	JOH	003	013	And no one hath ascended into heaven, but he who came down from heaven, even the Son of man.
043	JOH	003	014	And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of man be lifted up
043	JOH	003	015	that every one who believeth in him may have everlasting life.
043	JOH	003	016	For God so loved the world, that he gave the only begotten Son, that every one who believeth in him may not perish, but may have everlasting life.
043	JOH	003	017	For God sent not the Son into the world to condemn the world, but that through him the world might be saved.
043	JOH	003	018	He that believeth in him is not condemned; he that believeth not hath already been condemned, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.
043	JOH	003	019	And this is the condemnation, that the light hath come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light; for their deeds were evil.
043	JOH	003	020	For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, and cometh not to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.
043	JOH	003	021	But he that doeth the truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.
043	JOH	003	022	After these things Jesus and his disciples came into the land of Judaea; and there he remained with them, and baptized.
043	JOH	003	023	And John also was baptizing in AEnon, near Salim, because there was much water there; and they came, and were baptized.
043	JOH	003	024	For John was not yet thrown into prison.
043	JOH	003	025	Then there arose a question on the part of John's disciples with a Jew about purifying.
043	JOH	003	026	And they came to John, and said to him, Rabbi, he who was with thee beyond the Jordan, to whom thou hast borne witness, behold, he baptizeth, and all men are going to him.
043	JOH	003	027	John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, unless it be given him from heaven.
043	JOH	003	028	Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I was sent before that man.
043	JOH	003	029	He that hath the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice. This my joy then hath become full.
043	JOH	003	030	He must increase, but I must decrease.
043	JOH	003	031	He that cometh from above is above all. He that is from the earth is earthly, and speaketh earthly things; he that cometh from heaven
043	JOH	003	032	testifieth what he hath seen and heard; and no one receiveth his testimony.
043	JOH	003	033	He that hath received his testimony hath set his seal that God is true.
043	JOH	003	034	For he whom God sent speaketh the words of God; for he giveth not the Spirit by measure.
043	JOH	003	035	The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.
043	JOH	003	036	He that believeth in the Son hath everlasting life; and he that disobeyeth the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.
043	JOH	004	001	When therefore Jesus knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,
043	JOH	004	002	(though Jesus himself did not baptize, but his disciples, )
043	JOH	004	003	he left Judaea, and went again to Galilee.
043	JOH	004	004	And he must necessarily pass through Samaria.
043	JOH	004	005	He cometh therefore to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near the piece of land which Jacob gave to his son Joseph.
043	JOH	004	006	And Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with the journey, was sitting thus by the well. It was about the sixth hour.
043	JOH	004	007	There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water. Jesus saith to her, Give me to drink.
043	JOH	004	008	For his disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.
043	JOH	004	009	The Samaritan woman saith to him, How is it that thou, who art a Jew, askest drink of me, who am a Samaritan woman? For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.
043	JOH	004	010	Jesus answered and said to her, If thou hadst known the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink, thou wouldst have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.
043	JOH	004	011	The woman saith to him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep. Whence hast thou the living water?
043	JOH	004	012	Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his sons, and his cattle?
043	JOH	004	013	Jesus answered and said to her, Every one that drinketh of this water, will thirst again;
043	JOH	004	014	but whoever drinketh of the water that I will give him, will never thirst; but the water that I will give him will become within him a well of water springing up to everlasting life.
043	JOH	004	015	The woman saith to him, Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst, nor come hither to draw.
043	JOH	004	016	He saith to her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.
043	JOH	004	017	The woman answered, I have no husband. Jesus saith to her, Thou saidst well, that thou hast no husband.
043	JOH	004	018	For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband; in this thou hast spoken truly.
043	JOH	004	019	The woman saith to him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.
043	JOH	004	020	Our fathers worshipped on this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.
043	JOH	004	021	Jesus saith to her, Believe me, woman, the hour is coming, when ye shall neither on this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, worship the Father.
043	JOH	004	022	Ye worship that which ye know not; we worship that which we know; for salvation is from the Jews.
043	JOH	004	023	But the hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth; for such worshippers the Father seeketh.
043	JOH	004	024	God is a spirit; and they who worship must worship in spirit and in truth.
043	JOH	004	025	The woman saith to him, I know that Messiah cometh (who is called Christ); when he hath come, he will tell us all things.
043	JOH	004	026	Jesus saith to her, I who speak to thee am he.
043	JOH	004	027	And upon this his disciples came, and marveled that he was talking with a woman. Yet no one said, What dost thou seek? or, Why dost thou talk with her?
043	JOH	004	028	The woman then left her water-pot, and went away into the city, and saith to the men,
043	JOH	004	029	Come, see a man who told me all things which I have done. Is this the Christ?
043	JOH	004	030	They went out of the city, and came to him.
043	JOH	004	031	In the mean while the disciples asked him, saying, Rabbi, eat.
043	JOH	004	032	But he said to them, I have food to eat that ye know not of.
043	JOH	004	033	The disciples therefore said to one another, Hath any one brought him anything to eat?
043	JOH	004	034	Jesus saith to them, My food is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.
043	JOH	004	035	Do ye not say, There are yet four months, and the harvest cometh? Lo! I say to you, lift up your eyes, and look on the fields, that they are white for harvest.
043	JOH	004	036	Already is the reaper receiving wages, and gathering fruit unto everlasting life; that both the sower and the reaper may rejoice together.
043	JOH	004	037	And herein is fulfilled the true saying, One soweth, and another reapeth.
043	JOH	004	038	I have sent you to reap that whereon ye have not labored. Others have labored, and ye have entered into their labor.
043	JOH	004	039	And many of the Samaritans of that city believed in him because of the words of the woman, who testified, He told me all things which I have done.
043	JOH	004	040	When therefore the Samaritans came to him, they besought him to remain with them; and he remained there two days.
043	JOH	004	041	And many more believed on account of his word;
043	JOH	004	042	and said to the woman, No longer do we believe on account of what thou hast told us; for we have ourselves heard him, and know that this is in truth the Saviour of the world.
043	JOH	004	043	And after the two days he went from that place into Galilee.
043	JOH	004	044	For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honor in his own country.
043	JOH	004	045	When therefore he came into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all that he did in Jerusalem at the feast; for they also went to the feast.
043	JOH	004	046	So he came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick, at Capernaum.
043	JOH	004	047	He, having heard that Jesus had come out of Judaea into Galilee, went to him, and asked him to go down and heal his son; for he was at the point of death.
043	JOH	004	048	Then Jesus said to him, Unless ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.
043	JOH	004	049	The nobleman saith to him, Sir, come down before my child die.
043	JOH	004	050	Jesus saith to him, Go; thy son liveth. The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him, and went away.
043	JOH	004	051	And as he was now going down, the servants met him, and brought word that his child was living.
043	JOH	004	052	Then he inquired of them the hour when he began to mend. And they said to him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.
043	JOH	004	053	So the father knew that it was in the same hour in which Jesus said to him, Thy son is living. And he himself believed, and his whole house.
043	JOH	004	054	This again, a second sign, Jesus wrought, when he had come out of Judaea into Galilee.
043	JOH	005	001	After these things there was the feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
043	JOH	005	002	Now there is at Jerusalem, by the sheep-gate, a pool, which is called in Hebrew Bethzatha, having five porches.
043	JOH	005	003	In these were lying a multitude of diseased persons, blind, lame, withered.
043	JOH	005	005	And a certain man was there, who had had his infirmity thirty-eight years.
043	JOH	005	006	Jesus saw this man lying there, and knowing that he had been for a long time diseased, saith to him, Dost thou wish to be made well?
043	JOH	005	007	The diseased man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool; but while I am coming, another goeth down before me.
043	JOH	005	008	Jesus saith to him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.
043	JOH	005	009	And immediately the man was made well, and took up his bed, and walked. And that day was the sabbath.
043	JOH	005	010	The Jews therefore said to him that was cured, It is the sabbath; and it is not lawful for thee to take up the bed.
043	JOH	005	011	He answered them, He that made me well, the same said to me, Take up thy bed, and walk. T
043	JOH	005	012	hey asked him, Who is the man that said to thee, Take up, and walk?
043	JOH	005	013	But the diseased man knew not who it was; for Jesus had withdrawn himself, there being a crowd in the place.
043	JOH	005	014	Afterwards Jesus found him in the temple, and said to him, Behold, thou art made well; sin no more, lest something worse befall thee.
043	JOH	005	015	The man went away, and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.
043	JOH	005	016	And on this account the Jews persecuted Jesus, because he did these things on the sabbath.
043	JOH	005	017	But he answered them, My Father is working up to this time, and I work.
043	JOH	005	018	On this account the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only broke the sabbath, but also said that God was his own Father, making himself equal with God.
043	JOH	005	019	Then answered Jesus and said to them, Truly, truly do I say to you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father doing; for whatever He doeth, these things the Son also doeth in like manner;
043	JOH	005	020	for the Father loveth the Son, and showeth him all things which he himself doeth; and greater works than these will he show him, so that ye will wonder.
043	JOH	005	021	For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and giveth them life, so the Son also giveth life to whom he will.
043	JOH	005	022	For neither doth the Father judge any one, but hath committed all judgment to the Son;
043	JOH	005	023	that all may honor the Son, as they honor the Father. He that honoreth not the Son, honoreth not the Father, who sent him.
043	JOH	005	024	Truly, truly do I say to you, He that heareth my word, and believeth him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and cometh not into condemnation, but hath passed out of death into life.
043	JOH	005	025	Truly, truly do I say to you, The hour is coming and now is, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God; and they that hear will live.
043	JOH	005	026	For as the Father hath life in himself, so did he give to the Son also to have life in himself.
043	JOH	005	027	And he gave him authority to execute judgment, because he is a son of man.
043	JOH	005	028	Marvel not at this; for the hour is coming, in which all that are in the tombs will hear his voice,
043	JOH	005	029	and will come forth, they that have done good, to a resurrection of life; they that have done evil, to a resurrection of condemnation.
043	JOH	005	030	I can of myself do nothing. As I hear, I judge; and my judgment is just, because I seek not my own will, but the will of him that sent me.
043	JOH	005	031	If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.
043	JOH	005	032	There is another who beareth witness of me; and ye know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.
043	JOH	005	033	Ye have sent to John, and he hath borne witness to the truth.
043	JOH	005	034	But the testimony which I receive is not from man; but these things I say, that ye may be saved.
043	JOH	005	035	He was the burning and shining lamp: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.
043	JOH	005	036	But the testimony which I have, is greater than that of John; for the works which the Father hath given me to perform, the works themselves which I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.
043	JOH	005	037	And the Father who sent me, he hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his form.
043	JOH	005	038	And ye have not his word abiding in you; for whom he sent, him ye believe not.
043	JOH	005	039	Ye search the Scriptures, because ye yourselves think that in them ye have everlasting life; and it is they which testify of me;
043	JOH	005	040	and ye are not willing to come to me, that ye may have life.
043	JOH	005	041	I receive not honor from men;
043	JOH	005	042	but I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.
043	JOH	005	043	I have come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not; if another come in his own name, him ye will receive.
043	JOH	005	044	How can ye believe while ye receive honor from one another, and seek not the honor that is from him who alone is God?
043	JOH	005	045	Do not think that I shall accuse you to the Father; there is one that accuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye have placed your hope.
043	JOH	005	046	For if ye believed Moses, ye would believe me; for he wrote of me.
043	JOH	005	047	But if ye do not believe his writings, how will ye believe my words?
043	JOH	006	001	After these things Jesus went away across the lake of Galilee, that of Tiberias.
043	JOH	006	002	And a great multitude followed him, because they saw the signs which he wrought on the diseased.
043	JOH	006	003	And Jesus went up into the mountain, and sat there with his disciples.
043	JOH	006	004	And the passover, the feast of the Jews, was near.
043	JOH	006	005	Jesus then lifting up his eyes, and seeing that a great crowd was coming to him, saith to Philip, Whence are we to buy bread, that these may eat?
043	JOH	006	006	But this he said to try him; for he himself knew what he was going to do.
043	JOH	006	007	Philip answered him, Two hundred denaries' worth of bread is not sufficient for them, that each one may take a tittle.
043	JOH	006	008	One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, saith to him,
043	JOH	006	009	There is a lad here, who hath five barley-loaves, and two small fishes; but what are they among so many?
043	JOH	006	010	Jesus said, Make the men lie down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men lay down, in number about five thousand.
043	JOH	006	011	Jesus then took the loaves, and having given thanks, distributed to those that were lying down; in like manner also of the fishes, as much as they desired.
043	JOH	006	012	And when they were filled, he saith to his disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain over, that nothing may be lost.
043	JOH	006	013	So they gathered them up, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley-loaves, which remained over and above to those that had eaten.
043	JOH	006	014	The men therefore seeing the sign which he wrought, said, This is truly the prophet that was to come into the world.
043	JOH	006	015	Jesus therefore, knowing that they were about to come and take him by force to make him a king, withdrew again to the mountain alone.
043	JOH	006	016	But when evening came, his disciples went down to the lake,
043	JOH	006	017	and having gone on board a boat, were going over the lake to Capernaum. And darkness had overtaken them, and Jesus had not yet come to them.
043	JOH	006	018	And as a strong wind was blowing, the waves ran high.
043	JOH	006	019	When therefore they had rowed about twenty-five or thirty furlongs, they saw Jesus walking on the lake, and drawing near the boat; and they were afraid.
043	JOH	006	020	But he saith to them, It is I, be not afraid.
043	JOH	006	021	Then they were willing to receive him into the boat; and immediately the boat was at the land whither they were going.
043	JOH	006	022	The day following, the multitude which stood on the other side of the lake having seen that there was no other boat there but one, and that Jesus did not go with his disciples into the boat, but that his disciples went away alone,
043	JOH	006	023	(but there came other boats from Tiberias near the place where they ate the bread, when the Lord had given thanks; )
043	JOH	006	024	when therefore the multitude saw that Jesus was not there nor his disciples, they went on board the boats, and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.
043	JOH	006	025	And having found him on the other side of the lake, they said to him, Rabbi, when didst thou come hither?
043	JOH	006	026	Jesus answered them and said, Truly, truly do I say to you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw signs, but because ye ate of the loaves, and were filled.
043	JOH	006	027	Labor not for the food that perisheth, but for the food that endureth to everlasting life, which the Son of man giveth to you; for on him hath the Father set his seal, even God.
043	JOH	006	028	Then they said to him, What are we to do, that we may work the works of God?
043	JOH	006	029	Jesus answered and said to them, This is the work of God, that ye believe in him whom he sent.
043	JOH	006	030	They said therefore to him, What sign doest thou, that we may see, and believe thee? What dost thou work?
043	JOH	006	031	Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, as it is written, “He gave them bread from heaven to eat.”
043	JOH	006	032	Jesus therefore said to them, Truly, truly do I say to you, Moses hath not given you the bread from heaven; but my Father is giving you the true bread from heaven.
043	JOH	006	033	For the bread of God is that which is coming down from heaven, and giving life to the world.
043	JOH	006	034	They said therefore to him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.
043	JOH	006	035	Jesus therefore said to them, I am the bread of life; he that cometh to me will not hunger; and he that believeth in me will never thirst.
043	JOH	006	036	But I said to you, that ye have even seen, and do not believe.
043	JOH	006	037	All that the Father giveth me will come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out;
043	JOH	006	038	for I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him that sent me.
043	JOH	006	039	And this is the will of him that sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up in the last day.
043	JOH	006	040	For this is the will of my Father, that every one who looketh on the Son and believeth in him, shall have everlasting life; and I will raise him up in the last day.
043	JOH	006	041	The Jews therefore murmured about him, because he said, I am the bread which came down from heaven;
043	JOH	006	042	and they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, one whose father and mother we know? How is it then that this man saith, I have come down from heaven?
043	JOH	006	043	Jesus therefore answered and said to them, Murmur not among yourselves.
043	JOH	006	044	No one can come to me, unless the Father, who sent me, draw him: and I will raise him up in the last day.
043	JOH	006	045	It is written in the prophets, “And they shall all be taught of God.” Every one that hath heard the Father, and hath learnt from him, cometh to me.
043	JOH	006	046	Not that any one hath seen the Father, but he who is from God; he hath seen the Father.
043	JOH	006	047	Truly, truly do I say to you, He that believeth hath everlasting life.
043	JOH	006	048	I am the bread of life.
043	JOH	006	049	Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and died.
043	JOH	006	050	This is the bread which is coming down from heaven, that one may eat of it and not die.
043	JOH	006	051	I am the living bread which came down from heaven; if any one eat of my bread, he will live for ever. Yea, and the bread which I will give for the life of the world is my flesh.
043	JOH	006	052	The Jews therefore contended with one another, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat?
043	JOH	006	053	Jesus therefore said to them, Truly, truly do I say to you, Unless ye eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.
043	JOH	006	054	He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath everlasting life; and I will raise him up in the last day.
043	JOH	006	055	For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink.
043	JOH	006	056	He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me, and I in him.
043	JOH	006	057	As the living Father sent me, and I live by reason of the Father; so he that eateth me, he also shall live by reason of me.
043	JOH	006	058	This is the bread which came down from heaven; not as the fathers ate, and died; he that eateth this bread will live for ever.
043	JOH	006	059	These things he said in a synagogue, while teaching in Capernaum.
043	JOH	006	060	Many therefore of his disciples, when they heard this, said, This teaching is hard; who can listen to it?
043	JOH	006	061	Jesus therefore knew within himself that his disciples were murmuring about this, and said to them, Doth this offend you?
043	JOH	006	062	What then if ye behold the Son of man ascending where he was before?
043	JOH	006	063	It is the spirit which maketh alive; the flesh profiteth nothing. The words which I have spoken to you are spirit, and are life.
043	JOH	006	064	But there are some of you who do not believe. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that did not believe, and who it was that would betray him.
043	JOH	006	065	And he said, For this cause I have told you, that no one can come to me, unless it hath been given him from the Father.
043	JOH	006	066	From this time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.
043	JOH	006	067	Jesus therefore said to the twelve, Do ye also wish to go away?
043	JOH	006	068	Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? Thou hast words of everlasting life;
043	JOH	006	069	and we have believed and known, that thou art the Holy One of God.
043	JOH	006	070	Jesus answered them, Did not I choose you twelve? and one of you is a devil!
043	JOH	006	071	He spoke of Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot; for it was he that was about to betray him, being one of the twelve.
043	JOH	007	001	After these things Jesus walked in Galilee; for he would not walk in Judaea, because the Jews sought to kill him.
043	JOH	007	002	Now the feast of the Jews, the feast of tabernacles, was at hand.
043	JOH	007	003	His brothers therefore said to him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may see thy works which thou art doing.
043	JOH	007	004	For no one doeth anything in secret, and yet himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou doest these things, manifest thyself to the world.
043	JOH	007	005	For even his brothers did not believe in him.
043	JOH	007	006	Jesus saith to them, My time is not yet come; but your time is always ready.
043	JOH	007	007	The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that its works are evil.
043	JOH	007	008	Go ye up to the feast; I go not up to this feast; for my time is not yet fully come.
043	JOH	007	009	Having said these things, he remained in Galilee.
043	JOH	007	010	But when his brothers had gone up to the feast, then he also went up, not openly, but as it were in secret.
043	JOH	007	011	The Jews therefore sought him at the feast, and said, Where is that man?
043	JOH	007	012	And there was much debating among the multitude concerning him. Some said, He is a good man; others said, Nay, but he deceiveth the multitude.
043	JOH	007	013	No one, however, spoke openly of him, for fear of the Jews.
043	JOH	007	014	But when it was now the midst of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple and taught.
043	JOH	007	015	The Jews therefore marveled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?
043	JOH	007	016	Jesus therefore answered them, and said, My teaching is not mine, but his that sent me.
043	JOH	007	017	If any one is desirous to do his will, he will know concerning the teaching, whether it is from God, or whether I speak from myself.
043	JOH	007	018	He that speaketh from himself seeketh his own glory; but he that seeketh the glory of him that sent him, he is true, and in him is no unrighteousness.
043	JOH	007	019	Hath not Moses given you the Law? and none of you keepeth the Law! Why do ye seek to kill me?
043	JOH	007	020	The multitude answered, Thou hast a demon! Who seeketh to kill thee?
043	JOH	007	021	Jesus answered and said to them, I have done one good work, and ye are all wondering.
043	JOH	007	022	Moses hath given you circumcision, (not that it is from Moses, but from the fathers; ) and ye on the sabbath circumcise a man.
043	JOH	007	023	If a man receive circumcision on the sabbath, that the law of Moses may not be broken, are ye angry at me, because I have restored soundness to the whole body of a man on the sabbath?
043	JOH	007	024	Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.
043	JOH	007	025	Then some of the men of Jerusalem said, Is not this he whom they seek to kill?
043	JOH	007	026	and see! he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing to him. Have the rulers discovered certainly that this man is the Christ?
043	JOH	007	027	Still, as to this man, we know whence he is; but when the Christ cometh, no one knoweth whence he is.
043	JOH	007	028	Jesus therefore cried aloud, teaching in the temple and saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am; and I have not come of myself, but there is in truth one who sent me, whom ye know not.
043	JOH	007	029	I know him, because I am from him, and he hath sent me.
043	JOH	007	030	Therefore they sought to take him; but no one laid hands on him, because his hour had not yet come.
043	JOH	007	031	But of the multitude many believed in him, and said, When the Christ cometh, will he do more signs than these which this man doeth?
043	JOH	007	032	The Pharisees heard the multitude thus debating concerning him; and the chief priest and the Pharisees sent officers to seize him.
043	JOH	007	033	Jesus therefore said, Yet a little while I am with you, and then I go to him that sent me.
043	JOH	007	034	Ye will seek me and not find me; and where I am, ye cannot come.
043	JOH	007	035	The Jews therefore said among themselves, Whither will this man go, that we shall not find him? Will he go to the dispersed among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?
043	JOH	007	036	What meaneth this which he said, Ye will seek me, and not find me; and where I am, ye cannot come?
043	JOH	007	037	On the last day, which is the great day, of the feast, Jesus stood and cried aloud, saying, If any one thirst, let him come to me, and drink.
043	JOH	007	038	He that believeth in me, from within him, as the Scripture hath said, will flow rivers of living water.
043	JOH	007	039	But this he said of the Spirit, which those that believed in him were to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified.
043	JOH	007	040	Some of the multitude therefore, when they heard these words, said, This is in truth the prophet. Others said, This is the Christ.
043	JOH	007	041	Others said, Doth the Christ then come from Galilee?
043	JOH	007	042	Hath not the Scripture said, that the Christ cometh from the seed of David, and from Bethlehem, the town where David was?
043	JOH	007	043	So there was a division among the multitude because of him.
043	JOH	007	044	And some of them wished to seize him; but no one laid hands on him.
043	JOH	007	045	The officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees, who said to them, Why did ye not bring him?
043	JOH	007	046	The officers answered, Never man spoke like this man.
043	JOH	007	047	The Pharisees answered them, Have ye also been deceived?
043	JOH	007	048	Hath any one of the rulers believed in him? or of the Pharisees?
043	JOH	007	049	but this multitude that know not the Law are accursed.
043	JOH	007	050	Nicodemus saith to them, being one of them,
043	JOH	007	051	Doth our law judge a man, unless it first hear from him, and know what he doeth?
043	JOH	007	052	They answered and said to him, Art thou too from Galilee? Search and see that no prophet ariseth from Galilee.
043	JOH	007	053	(Joh 7:53 - 8:12: This passage is omitted as ungenuine by Tischendorf and most critical editors of the Greek Testament. It is found in some manuscripts, but not in the most ancient. It is, however, very generally regarded as a genuine relic of the teaching of Christ, though not forming a part of the fourth Gospel. I give it in the text of Tregelles, omitting the words which he incloses in brackets. Tregelles, however, does not suppose it to be genuine.) [[And they went each to his house;
043	JOH	008	001	but Jesus went to the mount of Olives.
043	JOH	008	002	And early in the morning he came again to the temple, and all the people were coming to him. And he sat down and taught them.
043	JOH	008	003	And the scribes and the Pharisees bring to him a woman taken in adultery; and having set her in the midst,
043	JOH	008	004	they say to him, Teacher, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act.
043	JOH	008	005	Now in the Law Moses commanded us to stone such persons; what then dost thou say?
043	JOH	008	006	But this they said to try him, that they might be able to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground.
043	JOH	008	007	But when they continued asking him, he lifted himself up, and said to them, Let him that is without sin among you first cast a stone at her.
043	JOH	008	008	And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.
043	JOH	008	009	And when they heard this, they went out one by one, beginning with the oldest; and Jesus was left alone, and the woman who was in the midst.
043	JOH	008	010	And Jesus lifted himself up and said to her, Woman, where are they? Did no one condemn thee!
043	JOH	008	011	And she said, No one, Lord. And Jesus said, neither do I condemn thee; go, and sin no more.
043	JOH	008	012	Again therefore Jesus spoke to them, saying, I am the light of the world; he that followeth me shall not walk in the darkness, but shall have the light of life.]]
043	JOH	008	013	The Pharisees therefore said to him, Thou bearest witness of thyself; thy witness is not true.
043	JOH	008	014	Jesus answered and said to them, Though I bear witness of myself, my witness is true; for I know whence I came, and whither I go; ye know not whence I come, or whither I go.
043	JOH	008	015	Ye judge according to the flesh; I judge no one.
043	JOH	008	016	But even if I myself should judge, my judgment is true, because I am not alone, but I and he who sent me.
043	JOH	008	017	Moreover, it is written in your law, that the witness of two men is true.
043	JOH	008	018	I am one who bear witness of myself, and the Father who sent me beareth witness of me.
043	JOH	008	019	They said therefore to him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye know neither me, nor my Father. If ye knew me, ye would know my Father also.
043	JOH	008	020	These words he spoke in the treasury, while teaching in the temple; and no one laid hands on him, because his hour had not yet come.
043	JOH	008	021	Again therefore he said to them, I go away, and ye will seek me, and will die in your sin. Whither I go, ye cannot come.
043	JOH	008	022	The Jews therefore said, Will he kill himself, that he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come?
043	JOH	008	023	And he said to them, Ye are from beneath, I am from above; ye are of this world, I am not of this world.
043	JOH	008	024	Therefore I said to you, that ye will die in your sins; for unless ye believe that I am He, ye will die in your sins.
043	JOH	008	025	They said therefore to him, Who art thou? Jesus said to them, In the first place, I am just that which I speak to you.
043	JOH	008	026	I have many things to say, and to judge, concerning you; but he who sent me is true; and I speak to the world what I heard from him.
043	JOH	008	027	They understood not that he spoke to them of the Father.
043	JOH	008	028	Jesus therefore said, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then ye will know that I am He, and do nothing of myself, but speak these things as the Father taught me.
043	JOH	008	029	And he that sent me is with me; he hath not left me alone, for I always do the things that please him.
043	JOH	008	030	As he spoke these words, many believed in him.
043	JOH	008	031	Jesus therefore said to those Jews who believed in him, If ye continue in my word, ye are truly my disciples;
043	JOH	008	032	and ye will know the truth, and the truth will make you free.
043	JOH	008	033	They answered him, We are Abraham's offspring, and have never been in bondage to any one; how sayest, thou, Ye will be made free?
043	JOH	008	034	Jesus answered them, Truly, truly do I say to you, Every one that committeth sin is a bond-servant of sin.
043	JOH	008	035	And the bond-servant abideth not in the house for ever; the son abideth for ever.
043	JOH	008	036	If therefore the Son make you free, ye will be free indeed.
043	JOH	008	037	I know that ye are Abraham's offspring; but ye seek to kill me, because my word is not received within you.
043	JOH	008	038	I speak what I have seen with the Father; and ye accordingly do what ye have seen with your father.
043	JOH	008	039	They answered and said to him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith to them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham.
043	JOH	008	040	But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath spoken to you the truth, which I heard from God; this did not Abraham.
043	JOH	008	041	Ye do the works of your father. They said to him, We were not born of fornication; we have one Father, God.
043	JOH	008	042	Jesus said to them, If God were your father, ye would love me; for from God I proceeded forth and am come; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.
043	JOH	008	043	Why do ye not understand my language? It is because ye cannot listen to my word.
043	JOH	008	044	Ye are of your father the Devil, and what your father desireth ye are ready to do. He was a murderer from the beginning; and he abideth not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh from his own nature; for he is a liar, and the father of it.
043	JOH	008	045	But because I speak the truth, ye believe me not.
043	JOH	008	046	Which of you convicteth me of sin? If I speak truth, Why do ye not believe me?
043	JOH	008	047	He that is of God heareth God's words; for this cause ye do not hear, because ye are not of God.
043	JOH	008	048	The Jews answered and said to him, Say we not well, that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a demon?
043	JOH	008	049	Jesus answered, I have not a demon, but I honor my Father, and ye dishonor me.
043	JOH	008	050	But I seek not my own glory; there is one that seeketh and judgeth.
043	JOH	008	051	Truly, truly do I say to you, If any one keep my word, he will never see death.
043	JOH	008	052	The Jews said to him, Now we know that thou hast a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If any one keep my word, he will never taste of death.
043	JOH	008	053	Art thou greater than our father Abraham, who died? The prophets also died. Whom dost thou make thyself?
043	JOH	008	054	Jesus answered, If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father that glorifieth me, of whom ye say, He is our God:
043	JOH	008	055	yet ye know him not; but I know him. And if I should say, I know him not, I should be a liar like you. But I know him, and keep his word.
043	JOH	008	056	Your father Abraham exulted that he might see my day; and he saw it, and was glad.
043	JOH	008	057	The Jews therefore said to him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?
043	JOH	008	058	Jesus said to them, Truly, truly do I say to you, From before Abraham was, I have been.
043	JOH	008	059	They therefore took up stones to throw at him; but Jesus concealed himself, and went out of the temple.
043	JOH	009	001	And as he was passing along, he saw a man who had been blind from his birth.
043	JOH	009	002	And his disciples asked him, saying, Rabbi, who sinned, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?
043	JOH	009	003	Jesus answered, Neither did this man sin, nor his parents; but that the works of God might be made manifest in him.
043	JOH	009	004	We must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day; the night is coming, when no one can work.
043	JOH	009	005	As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.
043	JOH	009	006	Having thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay with the spittle, and anointed his eyes with the clay,
043	JOH	009	007	and said to him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam; (which is, when translated, Sent.) He went away therefore, and washed and came seeing.
043	JOH	009	008	The neighbors therefore, and they who before had seen him as a beggar, said, Is not this he that sits and begs?
043	JOH	009	009	Some said, This is he. Others said, No, but he is like him. He said, I am he.
043	JOH	009	010	They said therefore to him How then were thine eyes opened?
043	JOH	009	011	He answered, The man who is called Jesus made clay and anointed my eyes, and said to me, Go to Siloam, and wash. I went therefore and washed, and received sight.
043	JOH	009	012	And they said to him, Where is that man? He saith, I do not know.
043	JOH	009	013	They bring to the Pharisees him who had once been blind.
043	JOH	009	014	And the day on which Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes was the sabbath.
043	JOH	009	015	Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight. He said to them, He put clay on my eyes, and I washed them, and I see.
043	JOH	009	016	Therefore some of the Pharisees said, This man is not from God, because he keepeth not the sabbath. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such signs. And there was a division among them.
043	JOH	009	017	They say therefore to the blind man again, What dost thou say of him for having opened thine eyes? And he said, He is a prophet.
043	JOH	009	018	The Jews therefore did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight.
043	JOH	009	019	And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? How then doth he now see?
043	JOH	009	020	His parents, answered and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind;
043	JOH	009	021	but by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who opened his eyes, we know not; ask him, he is of age; he will speak for himself.
043	JOH	009	022	This his parents said, because they feared the Jews. For the Jews had already agreed, that if any one should acknowledge him as the Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.
043	JOH	009	023	Therefore his parents said, He is of age; ask him.
043	JOH	009	024	They therefore called a second time the man that had been blind, and said to him, Give glory to God; we know that this man is a sinner.
043	JOH	009	025	He therefore answered, Whether he is a sinner, I know not; one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.
043	JOH	009	026	They said to him, What did he do to thee? How did he open thine eyes?
043	JOH	009	027	He answered them, I have already told you, and ye did not hear; why would ye hear it again? Are ye also inclined to become his disciples?
043	JOH	009	028	They reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are disciples of Moses.
043	JOH	009	029	We know that God hath spoken to Moses; but as for this man, we know not whence he is.
043	JOH	009	030	The man answered and said to them, Why, herein is a marvelous thing, that ye know not whence he is, and yet he opened my eyes.
043	JOH	009	031	We know that God heareth not sinners; but if any one is a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth.
043	JOH	009	032	Since the world began, it was never heard that any one opened the eyes of a man born blind.
043	JOH	009	033	If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.
043	JOH	009	034	They answered and said to him, Thou wast wholly born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.
043	JOH	009	035	Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and he found him, and said, Dost thou believe in the Son of man?
043	JOH	009	036	He answered and said, And who is he, Lord, that I may believe in him?
043	JOH	009	037	Jesus said to him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee.
043	JOH	009	038	And he said, I believe, Lord; and he prostrated himself before him.
043	JOH	009	039	And Jesus said, For judgment came I into this world; that they who see not might see, and that they who see might become blind.
043	JOH	009	040	Some of the Pharisees who were with him heard this, and said to him, Are we also blind?
043	JOH	009	041	Jesus said to them, If ye were blind, ye would not have sin; but now ye say, We see. Your sin remaineth.
043	JOH	010	001	Truly, truly do I say to you, He that entereth not through the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber;
043	JOH	010	002	but he that entereth through the door is the shepherd of the sheep.
043	JOH	010	003	To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice; and his own sheep he calleth by name, and leadeth them out.
043	JOH	010	004	When he hath put forth all his own, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him, because they know his voice.
043	JOH	010	005	But a stranger they will not follow, but will flee from him; because they know not the voice of strangers.
043	JOH	010	006	This parable Jesus spoke to them; but they did not understand what the things were which he spoke to them.
043	JOH	010	007	Jesus therefore said, Truly, truly do I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.
043	JOH	010	008	All those who came are thieves and robbers; but the sheep did not hear them.
043	JOH	010	009	I am the door; if any one enter through me, he will be saved, and will go in and out, and find pasture.
043	JOH	010	010	The thief cometh not but to steal, and to kill, and to destroy; I came that they might have life, and have abundance.
043	JOH	010	011	I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.
043	JOH	010	012	He that is a hireling and not a shepherd, nor the owner of the sheep, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth; and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep;
043	JOH	010	013	because he is a hireling, and careth not for the sheep.
043	JOH	010	014	I am the good shepherd, and I know my sheep, and they know me,
043	JOH	010	015	even as the Father knoweth me, and I know the Father; and I give my life for the sheep.
043	JOH	010	016	And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold; them also I must bring; and they will hear my voice, and there will be one flock, one shepherd.
043	JOH	010	017	On this account the Father loveth me, because I lay down my life, that I may take it again.
043	JOH	010	018	No one taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it again; this charge I received from my Father.
043	JOH	010	019	Again there arose a division among the Jews on account of these words.
043	JOH	010	020	Many of them said, He hath a demon, and is mad; why do ye hear him?
043	JOH	010	021	Others said, These are not the words of one that hath a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?
043	JOH	010	022	And the feast of the dedication came at Jerusalem. It was winter;
043	JOH	010	023	and Jesus was walking in the temple, in Solomon's porch.
043	JOH	010	024	Then came the Jews around him, and said to him, How long dost thou hold our minds in suspense? If thou art the Christ, tell us plainly.
043	JOH	010	025	Jesus answered them, I have told you, and ye do not believe. The works that I do in my Father's name, these bear witness of me.
043	JOH	010	026	But ye do not believe, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said to you.
043	JOH	010	027	My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me;
043	JOH	010	028	and I give them everlasting life; and they shall never perish, nor shall any one tear them out of my hand.
043	JOH	010	029	That which my Father hath given me is greater than all; and no one is able to tear [[them]] out of the Father's hand.
043	JOH	010	030	I and the Father are one.
043	JOH	010	031	The Jews again took up stones to stone him.
043	JOH	010	032	Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shown you from the Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?
043	JOH	010	033	The Jews answered him, Not for a good work do we stone thee, but for blasphemy, and because thou, who art a man, makest thyself God.
043	JOH	010	034	Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your Law, “I said, ye are gods”?
043	JOH	010	035	If he called them gods, to whom the word of God came, and the Scripture cannot be made void,
043	JOH	010	036	say ye of him whom the Father sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest, because I said, I am the Son of God?
043	JOH	010	037	If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.
043	JOH	010	038	But if I do them, though ye believe not me, believe the works; that ye may learn and know that the Father is in me, and I in the Father.
043	JOH	010	039	They sought therefore to seize him; and he went forth out of their hands.
043	JOH	010	040	And he went away again beyond the Jordan, to the place where John was at first baptizing; and there he abode.
043	JOH	010	041	And many came to him, and said, John indeed wrought no sign; but everything that John said of this man was true.
043	JOH	010	042	And many believed in him there.
043	JOH	011	001	But there was a certain man sick, Lazarus of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha.
043	JOH	011	002	It was the Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.
043	JOH	011	003	The sisters therefore sent to him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.
043	JOH	011	004	And Jesus hearing this said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified through it.
043	JOH	011	005	Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.
043	JOH	011	006	When therefore he heard that he was sick, he remained in the place where he was two days.
043	JOH	011	007	Then after this he saith to the disciples, Let us go into Judaea again.
043	JOH	011	008	The disciples say to him, Rabbi, the Jews but just now were seeking to stone thee, and goest thou thither again?
043	JOH	011	009	Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If a man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world;
043	JOH	011	010	but if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth; because the light is not in him.
043	JOH	011	011	This he spoke, and afterwards said to them, Our friend Lazarus hath fallen asleep; but I go that I may awake him out of sleep.
043	JOH	011	012	The disciples therefore said to him, Lord, if he hath fallen asleep, he will recover.
043	JOH	011	013	But Jesus had spoken of his death; but they thought that he spoke of the taking of rest in sleep.
043	JOH	011	014	Then therefore Jesus said to them plainly: Lazarus is dead.
043	JOH	011	015	And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there; that ye may believe; but let us go to him.
043	JOH	011	016	Then said Thomas, who was called Didymus, to his fellow-disciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.
043	JOH	011	017	Having come, therefore, Jesus found that he had been four days in the tomb.
043	JOH	011	018	Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off;
043	JOH	011	019	and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.
043	JOH	011	020	Martha therefore, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went to meet him; but Mary continued sitting in the house.
043	JOH	011	021	Then said Martha to Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died;
043	JOH	011	022	and even now I know that whatever thou shalt ask of God, God will give it thee.
043	JOH	011	023	Jesus saith to her, Thy brother will rise again.
043	JOH	011	024	Martha saith to him, I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.
043	JOH	011	025	Jesus said to her, I am the resurrection and the life: he that believeth in me, though he have died, will live;
043	JOH	011	026	and whoever liveth and believeth in me will never die. Believest thou this?
043	JOH	011	027	She saith to him, Yea, Lord; I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, he who was to come into the world.
043	JOH	011	028	And having said this, she went away, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Teacher is here and calleth for thee.
043	JOH	011	029	She, when she heard this, riseth quickly and cometh to him.
043	JOH	011	030	Now Jesus had not yet come into the town, but was still in the place where Martha met him.
043	JOH	011	031	The Jews then who were with her in the house and comforting her, when they saw that Mary rose up hastily and went out, followed her, thinking that she was going to the tomb to weep there.
043	JOH	011	032	Then Mary, when she came where Jesus was, as soon as she saw him fell down at his feet, saying to him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.
043	JOH	011	033	Jesus therefore when he saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping who came with her, was greatly moved in his spirit, and much troubled,
043	JOH	011	034	and said, Where have ye laid him? They say to him, Lord, come and see.
043	JOH	011	035	Jesus wept.
043	JOH	011	036	The Jews therefore said, See, how he loved him!
043	JOH	011	037	But some of them said, Could not he, who opened the eyes of the blind man, have also caused that this man should not have died?
043	JOH	011	038	Jesus therefore, again greatly moved within himself, cometh to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone lay against it.
043	JOH	011	039	Jesus saith, Take away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith to him, Lord, by this time the body is offensive; for he hath been dead four days.
043	JOH	011	040	Jesus saith to her, Did I not tell thee, that if thou wouldst believe, thou shouldst see the glory of God?
043	JOH	011	041	They therefore took away the stone. And Jesus lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father! I thank thee that thou hast heard me.
043	JOH	011	042	Yet I knew that thou hearest me always; but for the sake of the multitude standing around I said it, that they might believe that thou didst send me.
043	JOH	011	043	And having thus spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth!
043	JOH	011	044	He that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with grave-clothes; and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith to them, Loose him, and let him go.
043	JOH	011	045	Many of the Jews therefore who had come to Mary, and had seen what he did, believed in him.
043	JOH	011	046	But some of them went away to the Pharisees, and told them what Jesus had done.
043	JOH	011	047	Therefore the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered a council, and said, What are we to do, seeing that this man worketh many signs?
043	JOH	011	048	If we thus let him alone, all will believe in him; and the Romans will come, and take away both our place and nation.
043	JOH	011	049	And a certain one of them, Caiaphas, being high-priest that year, said to them, Ye know nothing at all;
043	JOH	011	050	nor do ye consider that it is expedient for us that one man die for the people, and not the whole nation perish.
043	JOH	011	051	And this he spoke not from himself; but being high-priest that year he prophesied that Jesus was about to die for the nation;
043	JOH	011	052	and not for the nation only, but that he might also gather together in one body the children of God that are scattered abroad.
043	JOH	011	053	Therefore from that day forth they consulted together to put him to death.
043	JOH	011	054	Jesus therefore no longer walked openly among the Jews, but departed thence to the country near the wilderness, to a city called Ephraim, and there abode with the disciples.
043	JOH	011	055	And the passover of the Jews was at hand; and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves.
043	JOH	011	056	They sought therefore for Jesus, and said one to another, as they stood in the temple, What think ye? that he will not come to the feast?
043	JOH	011	057	Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders, that, if any one knew where he was, he should give information, that they might seize him.
043	JOH	012	001	Jesus, therefore, six days before the passover, came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom Jesus raised from the dead.
043	JOH	012	002	They made therefore a supper for him there, and Martha served; but Lazarus was one of those who reclined at the table with him.
043	JOH	012	003	Then Mary, taking a pound of ointment of pure spikenard, very costly, anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair; and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment.
043	JOH	012	004	But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples, he who was about to betray him, saith,
043	JOH	012	005	Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred denaries, and given to the poor?
043	JOH	012	006	And this he said, not because he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and kept the purse, and bore what was put therein.
043	JOH	012	007	Then said Jesus, Let her alone, that she may keep it until the day of my burial.
043	JOH	012	008	For the poor ye have always with you, but me ye have not always.
043	JOH	012	009	The great multitude of the Jews therefore knew that he was there; and they came, not only on account of Jesus, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he raised from the dead.
043	JOH	012	010	But the priests consulted together that they might put Lazarus also to death;
043	JOH	012	011	because on his account many of the Jews were going away, and believing in Jesus.
043	JOH	012	012	On the next day, a great multitude that had come to the feast, hearing that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,
043	JOH	012	013	took branches of palm-trees, and went forth to meet him, crying aloud, Hosanna! blessed is he who cometh in the name of the Lord, even the king of Israel!
043	JOH	012	014	And Jesus, having found a young ass, sat thereon, as it is written,
043	JOH	012	015	“Fear not, daughter of Zion! lo! thy king cometh, sitting on an ass's colt.”
043	JOH	012	016	These things his disciples did not understand at the first; but when Jesus had been glorified, then they remembered that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things to him.
043	JOH	012	017	The multitude therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead bore witness.
043	JOH	012	018	For this cause also the multitude met him, because they had heard that he had wrought, this sign.
043	JOH	012	019	The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Ye see that ye effect nothing; o! the world hath gone after him.
043	JOH	012	020	Now there were certain Greeks among those who came up to worship at the feast.
043	JOH	012	021	These came therefore to Philip, who was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, Sir, we wish to see Jesus.
043	JOH	012	022	Philip goeth and telleth Andrew; Andrew and Philip go and tell Jesus.
043	JOH	012	023	But Jesus answereth them, saying, The hour hath come that the Son of man should be glorified.
043	JOH	012	024	Truly, truly do I say to you, Unless a grain of wheat fall into the ground and die, itself abideth alone; but if it die, it beareth much fruit.
043	JOH	012	025	He that loveth his life loseth it; and he that hateth his life in this world will keep it unto everlasting life.
043	JOH	012	026	If any one be a servant to me, let him follow me; and where I am, there also will my servant be; if any one serve me, the Father will honor him.
043	JOH	012	027	Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour! But for this cause I came to this hour.
043	JOH	012	028	Father, glorify thy name! Then came there a voice from heaven: Yea, I have glorified it, and will glorify it again.
043	JOH	012	029	The multitude therefore that stood by, hearing this, said that it thundered. Others said, An angel hath spoken to him.
043	JOH	012	030	Jesus answered and said, This voice hath come not for my sake, but for yours.
043	JOH	012	031	Now is the judgment of this world; now will the prince of this world be cast out;
043	JOH	012	032	and I, if I be lifted up from the earth, shall draw all men to me.
043	JOH	012	033	This he said, signifying what kind of death he was to die.
043	JOH	012	034	The multitude therefore answered him, We have heard out of the Law that the Christ abideth for ever; how then dost thou say that the Son of man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of man?
043	JOH	012	035	Jesus therefore said to them, Yet a little while is the light among you. Walk while ye have the light, that darkness may not overtake you; and he that walketh in the darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.
043	JOH	012	036	While ye have the light, believe in the light, that ye may become sons of light. These things spoke Jesus, and went away, and hid himself from them.
043	JOH	012	037	But though he had wrought so many signs before them, they did not believe in him;
043	JOH	012	038	that what was spoken by Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, “Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?”
043	JOH	012	039	For this cause they could not believe, because Isaiah said again,
043	JOH	012	040	“He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; lest they should see with their eyes, and understand with their heart, and turn from their ways, and I should heal them.”
043	JOH	012	041	These things said Isaiah, because he saw his glory, and spoke of him.
043	JOH	012	042	Yet even of the rulers many believed in him; but on account of the Pharisees they did not acknowledge him, lest they should be put of the synagogue;
043	JOH	012	043	for they loved the glory that is of men more than the glory that is of God.
043	JOH	012	044	But Jesus cried aloud, and said, He that believeth in me, believeth not in me, but in him that sent me;
043	JOH	012	045	and he that beholdeth me, beholdeth him that sent me.
043	JOH	012	046	I have come a light into the world, that whoever believeth in me may not remain in the darkness.
043	JOH	012	047	And if any one hear my words, and keep them not, I do not judge him; for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.
043	JOH	012	048	He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him; the word that I have spoken, that will judge him in the last day.
043	JOH	012	049	Because I have not spoken from myself; but the Father who sent me hath himself committed to me what I should say, and what I should speak;
043	JOH	012	050	and I know that what he hath committed to me is everlasting life. What I speak therefore, I speak as the Father hath directed me.
043	JOH	013	001	Now before the feast of the passover, Jesus, knowing that his hour had come that he should depart out of this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, loved them unto the end.
043	JOH	013	002	And supper being served, —the Devil having already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, to betray him, —
043	JOH	013	003	he, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he came forth from God, and was going to God,
043	JOH	013	004	riseth from the supper, and layeth aside his garments, and took a towel, and girded himself.
043	JOH	013	005	Then he poureth water into the basin, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded.
043	JOH	013	006	So he cometh to Simon Peter; who saith to him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet?
043	JOH	013	007	Jesus answered and said to him, What I do thou knowest not now, but thou wilt know hereafter.
043	JOH	013	008	Peter saith to him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.
043	JOH	013	009	Simon Peter saith to him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.
043	JOH	013	010	Jesus saith to him, He that hath bathed needeth not to wash himself, but is wholly clean; and ye are clean, but not all.
043	JOH	013	011	For he knew who was about to betray him; for this reason he said, Ye are not all clean.
043	JOH	013	012	So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and placed himself again at the table, he said to them, Know ye what I have done to you?
043	JOH	013	013	Ye call me the Teacher, and the Lord; and ye say well; for so I am.
043	JOH	013	014	If I then, the Lord and the Teacher, have washed your feet, ye also ought to wash one another's feet.
043	JOH	013	015	For I have given you an example, that ye also should do as I have done to you.
043	JOH	013	016	Truly, truly do I say to you, A servant is not greater than his lord, nor one who is sent greater than he that sent him.
043	JOH	013	017	If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.
043	JOH	013	018	I speak not of you all; I know whom I chose; but that the Scripture may be fulfilled, “He that eateth bread with me, hath lifted up his heel against me.”
043	JOH	013	019	I tell you now before it hath come to pass, that when it hath come to pass ye may believe that I am He.
043	JOH	013	020	Truly, truly do I say to you, He that receiveth whomever I send, receiveth me; and he that receiveth me, receiveth him who sent me.
043	JOH	013	021	Having said this, Jesus was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Truly, truly do I say to you, that one of you will betray me.
043	JOH	013	022	The disciples therefore looked at one another, doubting of whom he spoke.
043	JOH	013	023	There was reclining on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.
043	JOH	013	024	To him therefore Simon Peter maketh a sign, and saith to him, Tell who it is of whom he is speaking.
043	JOH	013	025	He, therefore, leaning back on the breast of Jesus, saith to him, Lord, who is it?
043	JOH	013	026	Jesus answereth, It is he for whom I shall dip the morsel and give it to him. Having therefore dipped the morsel, he taketh and giveth it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot.
043	JOH	013	027	And after the morsel, Satan entered into him. Jesus therefore saith to him, What thou doest, do quickly.
043	JOH	013	028	Now no one at the table knew for what intent he said this to him.
043	JOH	013	029	For some thought, because Judas kept the purse, that Jesus said to him, Buy what we need for the feast; or that he should give something to the poor.
043	JOH	013	030	He then, having received the morsel, went out immediately; and it was night.
043	JOH	013	031	When therefore he had gone out, Jesus saith, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.
043	JOH	013	032	If God is glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself, and will immediately glorify him.
043	JOH	013	033	My children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye will seek me; and, as I said to the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come, so now I say to you.
043	JOH	013	034	A new commandment I give you, that ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.
043	JOH	013	035	By this will all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one for another.
043	JOH	013	036	Simon Peter saith to him, Lord, whither dost thou go? Jesus answered, Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou wilt follow me afterward.
043	JOH	013	037	Peter saith to him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thee.
043	JOH	013	038	Jesus answereth, Wilt thou lay down thy life for me? Truly, truly do I say to thee, A cock will not crow, till thou hast thrice denied me.
043	JOH	014	001	Let not your heart be troubled. Have faith in God, and have faith in me.
043	JOH	014	002	In my Father's house are many mansions; if it were not so, I would have told you. For I go away to prepare a place for you;
043	JOH	014	003	and when I have gone away and prepared a place for you, I will come again, and will take you to myself; that where I am, ye also may be.
043	JOH	014	004	And ye know the way whither I go.
043	JOH	014	005	Thomas saith to him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; how then do we know the way?
043	JOH	014	006	Jesus saith to him, I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one cometh to the Father but through me.
043	JOH	014	007	If ye knew me, ye would know my Father also; and from this time ye know him, and have seen him.
043	JOH	014	008	Philip saith to him, Lord, show us the Father, and we shall be satisfied.
043	JOH	014	009	Jesus saith to him, Have I been so long time with you, and dost thou not know me, Philip? He that hath seen me hath seen the Father; how is it that thou sayest, Show us the Father?
043	JOH	014	010	Dost thou not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? The words that I speak to you, I speak not from myself; but the Father, who dwelleth in me, doeth his works.
043	JOH	014	011	Believe me, that I am in the Father, and the Father in me; but if not, believe for the very works' sake.
043	JOH	014	012	Truly, truly do I say to you, He that believeth in me, the works that I do shall he do also, and greater than these shall he do; because I am going to the Father,
043	JOH	014	013	and whatever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do; that the Father may be glorified in the Son.
043	JOH	014	014	If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it.
043	JOH	014	015	If ye love me, ye will keep my commandments;
043	JOH	014	016	and I will pray the Father, and he will give you another Comforter, that he may be with you for ever;
043	JOH	014	017	the Spirit of truth, which the world cannot receive, because it doth not behold it, nor know it; ye know it, because it abideth with you, and will be in you.
043	JOH	014	018	I will not leave you bereaved; I am coming to you.
043	JOH	014	019	Yet a little while, and the world beholdeth me no more; but ye will behold me, because I live, and ye will live.
043	JOH	014	020	In that day ye will know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you.
043	JOH	014	021	He that hath my commandments and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me; and he that loveth me will be loved by my Father; and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.
043	JOH	014	022	Judas, not Iscariot, saith to him, And how is it, Lord, that thou art going to manifest thyself to us, and not to the world?
043	JOH	014	023	Jesus answered and said to him, If any one loveth me, he will keep my word; and my Father will love him, and we will come to him, and make our abode with him.
043	JOH	014	024	He that loveth me not, keepeth not my words; and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father's who sent me.
043	JOH	014	025	These things have I spoken to you, while abiding with you;
043	JOH	014	026	but the Comforter, the Holy Spirit which the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all things which I have said to you.
043	JOH	014	027	Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you; not as the world giveth, do I give to you. Let not your heart be troubled, nor let it be afraid.
043	JOH	014	028	Ye heard me say to you, I am going away, and am coming again to you. If ye loved me, ye would have rejoiced that I go to the Father; for the Father is greater than I.
043	JOH	014	029	And now I have told you before it hath come to pass, that when it hath come to pass ye may believe.
043	JOH	014	030	I shall not talk much more with you. For the prince of the world cometh, and hath nothing in me.
043	JOH	014	031	But [[this must be]] that the world may know that I love the Father, and that as the Father gave me commandment so I do. Arise, let us go hence.
043	JOH	015	001	I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.
043	JOH	015	002	Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away; and every branch that beareth fruit he cleanseth, that it may bear more fruit.
043	JOH	015	003	Ye are clean already, by reason of the word which I have spoken to you.
043	JOH	015	004	Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, if it abide not in the vine, so neither can ye, unless ye abide in me.
043	JOH	015	005	I am the vine, ye are the branches. He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same beareth much fruit; for apart from me ye can do nothing.
043	JOH	015	006	If any one abideth not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather it, and cast it into the fire, and it is burned.
043	JOH	015	007	If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask whatever ye will, and it shall be done for you.
043	JOH	015	008	Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; and ye will become my disciples.
043	JOH	015	009	As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you; abide in my love.
043	JOH	015	010	If ye keep my commandments, ye will abide in my love, even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.
043	JOH	015	011	These things have I spoken to you, that my joy may remain in you, and that your joy may be made full.
043	JOH	015	012	This is my commandment, that ye love one another, as I have loved you.
043	JOH	015	013	Greater love hath no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends.
043	JOH	015	014	Ye are my friends, if ye do what I command you.
043	JOH	015	015	No longer do I call you servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things which I have heard from my Father, I have made known to you.
043	JOH	015	016	Ye did not choose me, but I chose you, and appointed you, that ye should go and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain; that whatever ye ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.
043	JOH	015	017	This I command you, that ye love one another.
043	JOH	015	018	If the world hateth you, ye know that it hath hated me before it hated you.
043	JOH	015	019	If ye were of the world, the world would love its own; but because ye are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.
043	JOH	015	020	Remember what I said to you, A servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my words, they will keep yours also.
043	JOH	015	021	But all these things will they do to you on account of my name, because they know not him that sent me.
043	JOH	015	022	If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.
043	JOH	015	023	He that hateth me, hateth my Father also.
043	JOH	015	024	If I had not done among them the works which no other man hath done, they would not have sin; but now they have both seen and hated both me and my Father.
043	JOH	015	025	But this cometh to pass, that the word may be fulfilled that is written in their Law: “They hated me without a cause.”
043	JOH	015	026	When the Comforter is come, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he will bear witness of me.
043	JOH	015	027	And ye also are witnesses, because ye have been with me from the beginning.
043	JOH	016	001	These things have I spoken to you, that ye may not fall away.
043	JOH	016	002	They will put you out of the synagogues; yea, the hour is coming when every one that killeth you will think that he is offering sacrifice to God.
043	JOH	016	003	And these things will they do, because they neither know the Father nor me.
043	JOH	016	004	But I have spoken these things to you, that, when the time cometh, ye may remember that I myself told you of them. But these things I told you not at the beginning, because I was with you.
043	JOH	016	005	But now I go to him that sent me; and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou?
043	JOH	016	006	But because I have spoken these things to you, sorrow hath filled your hearts.
043	JOH	016	007	But I tell you the truth; it is expedient for you that I depart. For if I do not depart, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you.
043	JOH	016	008	And when he is come, he will bring conviction to the world, of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment.
043	JOH	016	009	Of sin, because they believe not in me;
043	JOH	016	010	of righteousness, because I go to the Father, and ye see me no more;
043	JOH	016	011	of judgment, because the prince of this world hath been judged.
043	JOH	016	012	I have yet many things to say to you, but ye cannot bear them now.
043	JOH	016	013	But when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all the truth. For he will not speak from himself, but whatever he shall hear, that he will speak; and he will tell you the things to come.
043	JOH	016	014	He will glorify me, for he will receive of what is mine, and will tell it to you.
043	JOH	016	015	Every thing that the Father hath is mine. For this cause I said, that he receiveth of what is mine, and will tell it to you.
043	JOH	016	016	A little while, and ye no longer behold me; and again a little while, and ye will see me.
043	JOH	016	017	Some of his disciples therefore said to one another, What is this that he saith to us, A little while, and ye behold me not, and again a little while, and ye will see me? and, Because I go to the Father?
043	JOH	016	018	They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A little while? We do not know what he is speaking of.
043	JOH	016	019	Jesus knew that they were desirous of asking him, and said to them, Is it of this that ye are inquiring of one another, that I said, A little while, and ye behold me not, and again a little while, and ye will See me?
043	JOH	016	020	Truly, truly do I say to you, that ye will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice; ye will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will be turned into joy.
043	JOH	016	021	A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come; but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, through joy that a man is born into the world.
043	JOH	016	022	So ye also now have sorrow; but I shall see you again, and your heart will rejoice, and your joy no one taketh from you.
043	JOH	016	023	And in that day ye will ask nothing of me. Truly, truly do I say to you, Whatever ye shall ask the Father, he will give it you in my name.
043	JOH	016	024	Hitherto ye have asked nothing in my name; ask, and ye will receive, that your joy may be made full.
043	JOH	016	025	These things I have spoken to you in parables. The time is coming, when I shall no more speak to you in parables, but shall tell you plainly of the Father.
043	JOH	016	026	In that day ye will ask in my name; and I do not tell you that I will pray the Father for you;
043	JOH	016	027	for the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came forth from God.
043	JOH	016	028	I came forth from the Father, and have come into the world; again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.
043	JOH	016	029	His disciples say, Lo! now thou speakest plainly, and speakest no parable.
043	JOH	016	030	Now are we sure that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any one should ask thee; by this we believe that thou camest forth from God.
043	JOH	016	031	Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe?
043	JOH	016	032	Behold, the hour is coming, yea, is now come, when ye will be scattered, every one to his own, and will leave me alone; and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.
043	JOH	016	033	These things I have spoken to you, that in me ye may have peace. In the world ye have tribulation; but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.
043	JOH	017	001	When Jesus had thus spoken, he lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father! the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that the Son may glorify thee;
043	JOH	017	002	according as thou gavest him authority over all flesh, that he should give everlasting life to all whom thou hast given him.
043	JOH	017	003	And this is the everlasting life, to know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou didst send.
043	JOH	017	004	I have glorified thee on the earth, having finished the work which thou gavest me to do;
043	JOH	017	005	and now, Father! do thou glorify me with thyself, with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.
043	JOH	017	006	I manifested thy name to the men whom thou gavest me out of the world. Thine they were, and thou gavest them to me; and they have kept thy word.
043	JOH	017	007	Now they know that all things whatever thou hast given me are from thee;
043	JOH	017	008	for I have given to them the words which thou hast given me; and they received them, and knew surely that I came forth from thee, and believed that thou didst send me.
043	JOH	017	009	I pray for them; I pray not for the world, but for those whom thou hast given me; for they are thine;
043	JOH	017	010	and all things that are mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them.
043	JOH	017	011	And I am no longer in the world; and they are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father! keep them in thy name which thou hast given me, that they may be one, even as we are.
043	JOH	017	012	While I was with them, I kept them in thy name which thou hast given me, and guarded them; and no one of them is lost except the son of perdition, that the Scripture may be fulfilled.
043	JOH	017	013	But now I come to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they may have my joy made full in them.
043	JOH	017	014	I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.
043	JOH	017	015	I do not pray thee to take them out of the world, but to keep them from evil.
043	JOH	017	016	They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.
043	JOH	017	017	Sanctify them in thy truth; thy word is truth.
043	JOH	017	018	As thou didst send me into the world, I also sent them into the world.
043	JOH	017	019	And in their behalf I sanctify myself, that they also may be sanctified in the truth.
043	JOH	017	020	Yet not for these alone do I pray, but also for those who believe in me through their word;
043	JOH	017	021	that they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me and I in thee, that they also may be in us, that the world may believe that thou didst send me.
043	JOH	017	022	And the glory which thou hast given me, I have given them, that they may be one, even as we are one;
043	JOH	017	023	I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one, that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me.
043	JOH	017	024	Father! as to that which thou hast given me, I desire that they also be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory which thou hast given me; for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.
043	JOH	017	025	Righteous Father! and yet the world knew thee not! but I knew thee, and these knew that thou didst send me.
043	JOH	017	026	And I made known to them thy name, and will make it known; that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them.
043	JOH	018	001	When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples across the brook Kedron, where was a garden, into which he entered with his disciples.
043	JOH	018	002	And Judas also, his betrayer, knew the place; because Jesus often resorted thither with his disciples.
043	JOH	018	003	Judas then, having received the band of soldiers, and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, cometh thither with torches and lanterns and weapons.
043	JOH	018	004	But Jesus, knowing all things that were coming upon him, went forth, and saith to them, Whom do ye seek?
043	JOH	018	005	They answered him, Jesus the Nazarene. Jesus saith to them, I am he. Now Judas also, his betrayer, was standing with them.
043	JOH	018	006	As soon then as he said to them, I am he, they went backward, and fell to the ground.
043	JOH	018	007	Again therefore he asked them, Whom do ye seek? And they said, Jesus the Nazarene.
043	JOH	018	008	Jesus answered, I have told you that I am he. If therefore ye are seeking me, let these men go.
043	JOH	018	009	That the saying might be fulfilled which he spoke, “Of those whom thou hast given me, I have lost none.”
043	JOH	018	010	Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it and smote the servant of the high-priest, and cut off his right ear. And the servant's name was Malchus.
043	JOH	018	011	Jesus therefore said to Peter, Put up the sword into the sheath. The cup which the Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?
043	JOH	018	012	So the band and the captain, and the officers of the Jews, took Jesus and bound him,
043	JOH	018	013	and carried him to Annas first; for he was father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high-priest that year.
043	JOH	018	014	And it was Caiaphas who counseled the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.
043	JOH	018	015	And Simon Peter and the other disciple followed Jesus. That disciple was an acquaintance of the high-priest, and went with Jesus into the court of the palace of the high-priest.
043	JOH	018	016	But Peter was standing outside at the door. The other disciple therefore, who was an acquaintance of the high-priest, went out and spoke to her that kept the door, and brought in Peter.
043	JOH	018	017	Then the maid-servant that kept the door saith to Peter, Art thou also one of this man's disciples? He saith, I am not.
043	JOH	018	018	And the servants and the officers were standing there, having made a fire of coals, for it was cold, and were warming themselves; and Peter was standing with them and warming himself.
043	JOH	018	019	The high-priest then asked Jesus about his disciples, and about his teaching.
043	JOH	018	020	Jesus answered him, I have spoken plainly to the world; I always taught in a synagogue and in the temple, where all the Jews assemble, and in secret I spoke nothing.
043	JOH	018	021	Why askest thou me? Ask those who have heard, what I have spoken to them; behold, these know what I have said.
043	JOH	018	022	And when he had said this, one of the officers who was standing by struck Jesus on the face, saying, Is it thus that thou answerest the high-priest?
043	JOH	018	023	Jesus answered him, If I spoke what is evil, testify to the evil; but if well, why dost thou strike me?
043	JOH	018	024	Annas therefore sent him bound to Caiaphas the high-priest.
043	JOH	018	025	And Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. So they said to him, Art thou also one of his disciples? He denied and said, I am not.
043	JOH	018	026	One of the servants of the high-priest, being a kinsman of him whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him?
043	JOH	018	027	Then Peter denied again; and immediately a cock crew.
043	JOH	018	028	Then they lead Jesus from Caiaphas to the governor's palace; and it was early. And they did not themselves go into the palace, that they might not be defiled, but might eat the passover.
043	JOH	018	029	Pilate therefore went out to them, and saith, What accusation do ye bring against this man?
043	JOH	018	030	They answered and said to him, If he had not been doing evil, we would not have delivered him up to thee.
043	JOH	018	031	Pilate therefore said to them, Take him yourselves, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said to him, It is not lawful for us to put any one to death.
043	JOH	018	032	That the words of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spoke, signifying what kind of death he was to die.
043	JOH	018	033	Pilate therefore went into the palace again, and called Jesus, and said to him, Art thou the King of the Jews?
043	JOH	018	034	Jesus answered, Dost thou say this of thyself, or did others tell thee concerning me?
043	JOH	018	035	Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thy own nation and the chief priests delivered thee up to me. What hast thou done?
043	JOH	018	036	Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, my servants would have fought, that I should not be delivered up to the Jews; but now is my kingdom not from hence.
043	JOH	018	037	Pilate therefore said to him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest what is true; for I am a king. For this end have I been born, and for this cause have I come into the world, that I may bear witness to the truth. Every one that is of the truth listeneth to my voice.
043	JOH	018	038	Pilate saith to him, What is truth? And having said this, he went out again to the Jews, and saith to them, I find nothing criminal in him.
043	JOH	018	039	But ye have a custom that I should release to you one at the passover: do ye desire, therefore, that I release to you the king of the Jews?
043	JOH	018	040	Then they cried out again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.
043	JOH	019	001	Then therefore Pilate took Jesus and scourged him.
043	JOH	019	002	And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and put on him a purple robe, and approached him
043	JOH	019	003	and said, Hail, king of the Jews! and they gave him blows on the face.
043	JOH	019	004	Again Pilate went forth, and saith to them, Behold, I bring him forth to you, that ye may know that I find nothing criminal in him.
043	JOH	019	005	Jesus therefore came forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. And [[Pilate]] saith to them, Behold the man!
043	JOH	019	006	When therefore the chief priests and the officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify! crucify! Pilate saith to them, Take him yourselves, and crucify him; for I find nothing criminal in him.
043	JOH	019	007	The Jews answered him, We have a law, and according to the law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.
043	JOH	019	008	When Pilate therefore heard this, he was the more afraid;
043	JOH	019	009	and went again into the palace, and saith to Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.
043	JOH	019	010	Pilate saith to him, Dost thou not speak to me? Dost thou not know that I have power to release thee, and have power to crucify thee?
043	JOH	019	011	Jesus answered, Thou wouldst have no power against me, unless it had been given thee from above; for this cause he that delivered me up to thee hath the greater sin.
043	JOH	019	012	From this time Pilate sought to release him. But the Jews cried out, saying, If thou release this man, thou art not a friend of Caesar. Every one that maketh himself a king, setteth himself against Caesar.
043	JOH	019	013	When therefore Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down on the judgment-seat, in a place called the Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha.
043	JOH	019	014	Now it was the preparation of the passover. It was about the sixth hour. And he saith to the Jews, Behold your king!
043	JOH	019	015	Upon this they cried out, Away with him! Away with him! Crucify him! Pilate saith to them, Shall I crucify your king? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.
043	JOH	019	016	Then therefore he delivered him up to them to be crucified. They therefore took Jesus;
043	JOH	019	017	and bearing his own cross, he went forth into the place called Place of a Skull; in Hebrew, Golgotha;
043	JOH	019	018	where they crucified him, and with him two others, one on each side, and Jesus in the midst.
043	JOH	019	019	And Pilate wrote an inscription also, and put it on the cross. And the writing was, “Jesus the Nazarene, the king of the Jews.”
043	JOH	019	020	This inscription therefore was read by many of the Jews; for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek.
043	JOH	019	021	Therefore the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, Write not, The king of the Jews; but that he said, I am king of the Jews.
043	JOH	019	022	Pilate answered, What I have written, I have written.
043	JOH	019	023	Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments and made four parts, to every soldier a part, and also his coat. Now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.
043	JOH	019	024	They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be. That the scripture might be fulfilled: “They parted my garments among them, and for my vesture they cast lots.” These things the soldiers did.
043	JOH	019	025	Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary the Magdalene.
043	JOH	019	026	Jesus therefore, when he saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved standing by, saith to his mother, Woman, behold thy son!
043	JOH	019	027	Then he saith to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that hour the disciple took her to his own home.
043	JOH	019	028	After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now finished, in order that the Scripture might be accomplished, saith, I thirst.
043	JOH	019	029	A vessel was brought full of vinegar; and putting a sponge filled with vinegar upon a stalk of hyssop, they raised it to his mouth.
043	JOH	019	030	When therefore he had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished! and he bowed his head, and yielded up his spirit.
043	JOH	019	031	The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies might not remain upon the cross on the sabbath, for that sabbath was a great day, besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.
043	JOH	019	032	So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who was crucified with him.
043	JOH	019	033	But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was already dead, they broke not his legs;
043	JOH	019	034	but one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and immediately there came out blood and water.
043	JOH	019	035	And he that hath seen hath borne witness, and his witness is true; and he knoweth that he saith what is true, that ye also may believe.
043	JOH	019	036	For these things came to pass, that the scripture might be fulfilled, “A bone of him shall not be broken.”
043	JOH	019	037	And again another scripture saith, “They shall look on him whom they pierced.”
043	JOH	019	038	And after this, Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but concealing it for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus; and Pilate gave him leave. They came therefore and took him away.
043	JOH	019	039	Nicodemus also, he who at the first went to him by night, came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds weight.
043	JOH	019	040	Then they took the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen cloths with the spices, as is the manner of the Jews in preparing for burial.
043	JOH	019	041	Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one had ever been laid.
043	JOH	019	042	There then, on account of the Jews' preparation-day, they laid Jesus; for the tomb was at hand.
043	JOH	020	001	But on the first day of the week Mary the Magdalene cometh early, while it was yet dark, to the tomb, and seeth that the stone had been taken away from the tomb.
043	JOH	020	002	She runneth therefore, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and saith to them, They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we know not where they have laid him.
043	JOH	020	003	Peter therefore went forth, and the other disciple, and they set out for the tomb.
043	JOH	020	004	And they ran both together; and the other disciple outran Peter, and came first to the tomb.
043	JOH	020	005	And stooping down, he seeth the linen cloths lying; but he did not go in.
043	JOH	020	006	Then cometh also Simon Peter following him, and he went into the tomb; and he beholdeth the linen cloths lying,
043	JOH	020	007	and the napkin that was about his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but folded up in a place by itself.
043	JOH	020	008	Then therefore went in also the other disciple, who came first to the tomb; and he saw, and believed.
043	JOH	020	009	For not even yet did they know the Scripture, that he must rise from the dead.
043	JOH	020	010	So the disciples went away again to their home.
043	JOH	020	011	But Mary was standing without by the tomb weeping. And as she wept, she stooped down into the tomb,
043	JOH	020	012	and beholdeth two angels in white sitting, one at the head, and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.
043	JOH	020	013	And they say to her, Woman, why dost thou weep? She saith to them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.
043	JOH	020	014	Having said this, she turned back, and beheld Jesus standing; and knew not that it was Jesus.
043	JOH	020	015	Jesus saith to her, Woman, why dost thou weep? whom dost thou seek? She, supposing that it was the gardener, saith to him, Sir, if thou hast borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.
043	JOH	020	016	Jesus saith to her, Mary! She turned and saith to him in Hebrew, Rabboni! Which signifieth, Teacher!
043	JOH	020	017	Jesus saith to her, Touch me not; for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to my brethren, and say to them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, and my God and your God.
043	JOH	020	018	Mary the Magdalene cometh, bringing word to the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that he had said these things to her.
043	JOH	020	019	When therefore it was evening on that day, which was the first day of the week, and the doors where the disciples were had been shut for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and said to them, Peace be to you!
043	JOH	020	020	And having said this, he showed them his hands and his side. The disciples therefore were glad, when they saw the Lord.
043	JOH	020	021	Then he said to them again, Peace be to you! As the Father hath sent me, I also send you.
043	JOH	020	022	And having said this, he breathed on them, and saith to them, Receive the Holy Spirit.
043	JOH	020	023	Whosever sins ye remit, they are remitted to them; whosever ye retain, they are retained.
043	JOH	020	024	But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.
043	JOH	020	025	The other disciples therefore said to him, We have seen the Lord. But he said to them, Unless I see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the place of the nails, and put my hand into his side, I shall not believe.
043	JOH	020	026	And after eight days the disciples were again within, and Thomas with them. Jesus cometh, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be to you!
043	JOH	020	027	Then he saith to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands, and reach forth thy hand, and put it into my side; and be not faithless, but believing.
043	JOH	020	028	Thomas answered and said to him, My Lord and my God!
043	JOH	020	029	Jesus saith to him, Because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed; blessed are they who have not seen, and yet have believed.
043	JOH	020	030	Many other signs did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book.
043	JOH	020	031	But these have been written, that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ the Son of God, and that believing ye may have life in his name.
043	JOH	021	001	After these things he manifested himself again to the disciples at the lake of Tiberias. And he manifested himself in this manner.
043	JOH	021	002	There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana of Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples.
043	JOH	021	003	Simon Peter saith to them, I am going a fishing. They say to him, We also will go with thee. They set out and went into the boat, and on that night caught nothing.
043	JOH	021	004	But when the morning was coming on, Jesus stood on the shore; but the disciples did not know that it was Jesus.
043	JOH	021	005	Then Jesus saith to them, Children, have ye any fish? They answered him, No.
043	JOH	021	006	And he said to them, Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and ye will find. And they cast it, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of the fishes.
043	JOH	021	007	Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith to Peter, It is the Lord. Simon Peter therefore, hearing that it was the Lord, girded on his outer garment, for he had on nothing but his under one, and threw himself into the lake.
043	JOH	021	008	And the other disciples came in the boat, (for they were not far from land, only about two hundred cubits, ) dragging the net with the fishes.
043	JOH	021	009	When therefore they had come to land, they see a fire of coals there, and a fish lying thereon, and bread.
043	JOH	021	010	Jesus saith to them, Bring of the fish which ye have now caught.
043	JOH	021	011	Simon Peter therefore went on board, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, a hundred and fifty three; and though there were so many, the net was not broken.
043	JOH	021	012	Jesus saith to them, Come and breakfast. But no one of the disciples durst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.
043	JOH	021	013	Jesus cometh and taketh the bread, and giveth them, and the fish likewise.
043	JOH	021	014	This is now the third time that Jesus manifested himself to his disciples, after he had risen from the dead.
043	JOH	021	015	So when they had breakfasted, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of John, lovest thou me more than these? He saith to him, Yea, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee. He saith to him, Feed my lambs.
043	JOH	021	016	He saith to him again a second time, Simon, son of John, lovest thou me? He saith to him, Yea, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee. He saith to him, Tend my sheep.
043	JOH	021	017	He saith to him the third time, Simon, son of John, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said to him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith to him, Feed my sheep.
043	JOH	021	018	Truly, truly do I say to thee, when thou wast young, thou didst gird thyself, and walk whither thou wouldst; but when thou hast grown old, thou wilt stretch forth thy hands, and another will gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldst not.
043	JOH	021	019	This he said, signifying by what manner of death he was to glorify God. And having thus spoken, he saith to him, Follow me.
043	JOH	021	020	Peter, turning round, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following, —who also at supper leaned back on his breast, and said, Lord, who is he that betrayeth thee?—
043	JOH	021	021	Peter, seeing him, saith to Jesus, Lord, and how will it be with him?
043	JOH	021	022	Jesus saith to him, If it be my will that he remain till I come, what is it to thee? Follow thou me.
043	JOH	021	023	This report therefore went abroad among the brethren, that this disciple was not to die. And yet Jesus did not say to him, He will not die; but, If it be my will that he remain till I come, what is it to thee?
043	JOH	021	024	This is the disciple who testifieth of these things, and hath written these things; and we know that his testimony is true.

# BOOK	044	ACT	Acts	Acts
044	ACT	001	001	The former narrative I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus both did and taught from the beginning
044	ACT	001	002	until the day in which, after he had through the Holy Spirit given commandments to the apostles whom he had chosen, he was taken up;
044	ACT	001	003	to whom also he showed himself living, after he had suffered, by many sure proofs, appearing to them during forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God.
044	ACT	001	004	And while in assembly with them, he commanded them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for what had been promised by the Father, which [[said he]] ye heard from me;
044	ACT	001	005	for John indeed baptized with water, but ye will be baptized in the Holy Spirit not many days hence.
044	ACT	001	006	They therefore, having come together, asked him, saying, Lord, art thou at this time about to restore the kingdom to Israel?
044	ACT	001	007	But he said to them, It belongeth not to you to know times or seasons, which the Father appointed by his own authority.
044	ACT	001	008	But ye will receive power when the Holy Spirit hath come upon you; and ye will be my witnesses, both in Jerusalem and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and to the end of the earth.
044	ACT	001	009	And having thus spoken, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.
044	ACT	001	010	And while they were looking earnestly into heaven as he went up, lo! two men stood by them in white apparel,
044	ACT	001	011	who said, Men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? This Jesus, who hath been taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same manner in which ye beheld him going into heaven.
044	ACT	001	012	Then they returned to Jerusalem, from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, within a sabbath-day's journey.
044	ACT	001	013	And when they had come in, they went up into the upper room where they were making their abode, namely, Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon the zealot, and Judas the brother of James.
044	ACT	001	014	These all continued with one accord in prayer, with women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and his brothers.
044	ACT	001	015	And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the brethren, and said, (the number of the names together was about one hundred and twenty, )
044	ACT	001	016	Brethren, it was necessary that this scripture should be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit through the mouth of David spoke before concerning Judas, who became guide to those who took Jesus.
044	ACT	001	017	For he was numbered among us, and obtained the allotment of this ministry.
044	ACT	001	018	Now this man purchased a field with the wages of the iniquity; and falling headlong he burst asunder in the middle, and all his bowels gushed out.
044	ACT	001	019	And it became known to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that that field is called in their own tongue, Aceldamach, that is, Field of Blood.
044	ACT	001	020	For it is written in the book of Psalms, “Let his habitation be made desolate, and let no one dwell therein;” and, “Let another take his office.”
044	ACT	001	021	Of these men, therefore, who accompanied us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,
044	ACT	001	022	from the baptism of John until the day when he was taken up from us, must one be made a witness with us of his resurrection.
044	ACT	001	023	And they proposed two, Joseph called Barsabbas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.
044	ACT	001	024	And they prayed saying, Thou, Lord, who knowest the hearts of all men, show which of these two thou hast chosen
044	ACT	001	025	to take the part of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas by transgression fell away, that he might go to his own place.
044	ACT	001	026	And they cast lots for them; and the lot fell upon Matthias, and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.
044	ACT	002	001	And on the day of Pentecost they were all together in one place.
044	ACT	002	002	And suddenly there came out of heaven a sound, as of a rushing mighty wind; and it filled the whole house where they were sitting;
044	ACT	002	003	and there appeared to them tongues as of fire, distributing themselves; and one sat upon each of them.
044	ACT	002	004	And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other tongues, even as the Spirit gave them utterance.
044	ACT	002	005	Now there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, from every nation under heaven.
044	ACT	002	006	And when this sound took place, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because every one heard them speaking in his own language.
044	ACT	002	007	And they were amazed, and marveled, saying, Behold, are not all these who speak Galilaeans?
044	ACT	002	008	and how is it that we every one hear them in our own language, wherein we were born?
044	ACT	002	009	Parthians and Medes and Elamites, and those who inhabit Mesopotamia, Judaea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,
044	ACT	002	010	Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and Romans who sojourn here, both Jews and Proselytes,
044	ACT	002	011	Cretans and Arabians—how is it that we hear them speaking in our tongues the wonderful works of God?
044	ACT	002	012	And they were all amazed and were in doubt, saying one to another, What can this mean?
044	ACT	002	013	Others making sport of it, said, They are full of new wine.
044	ACT	002	014	But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said to them, Men of Judea, and all that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known to you, and hearken to my words.
044	ACT	002	015	For these are not drunken, as ye suppose; for it is the third hour of the day;
044	ACT	002	016	but this is what was spoken through the prophet Joel,
044	ACT	002	017	“It shall be in the last days, saith God, that I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters will prophesy, and your young men will see visions, and your old men will dream dreams;
044	ACT	002	018	and even on my servants, and on my handmaids, I will pour out of my Spirit in those days, and they will prophesy.
044	ACT	002	019	And I will show wonders in heaven above, and signs on the earth beneath, blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke;
044	ACT	002	020	the sun will be turned into darkness and the moon into blood, before the day of the Lord cometh, the great and notable day.
044	ACT	002	021	And it shall be that every one that calleth on the name of the Lord shall be saved.”
044	ACT	002	022	Men of Israel, hear these words! Jesus the Nazarene, a man approved of God to you by miracles, and wonders, and signs, which God wrought by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves know, —
044	ACT	002	023	this man, being delivered up by the settled purpose and foreknowledge of God, ye, by the hand of godless men, crucified and slew.
044	ACT	002	024	But God raised him up, having loosed the pains of death, because it was not possible that he should be held by it.
044	ACT	002	025	For David saith concerning him, “I saw the Lord always before me; because he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved.
044	ACT	002	026	Therefore my heart rejoiced, and my tongue exulted; moreover also, my flesh shall dwell in hope;
044	ACT	002	027	because thou wilt not abandon my soul to the underworld, nor wilt thou suffer thy holy one to see corruption.
044	ACT	002	028	Thou didst make known to me the ways of life; thou wilt make me full of joy with thy countenance.”
044	ACT	002	029	Brethren, I may speak to you with freedom of the patriarch David, that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is among us to this day.
044	ACT	002	030	Being then a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn to him with an oath that he would set one sprung from his loins upon his throne,
044	ACT	002	031	he foresaw and spoke of the resurrection of Christ, that neither was he abandoned to the underworld, nor did his flesh see corruption.
044	ACT	002	032	This Jesus God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.
044	ACT	002	033	Being therefore exalted by the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promised Holy Spirit, he hath poured forth this, which ye both see and hear.
044	ACT	002	034	For David did not ascend into the heavens; but he himself saith, The Lord said to my lord, “Sit thou on my right hand,
044	ACT	002	035	until I make thine enemies thy footstool.”
044	ACT	002	036	Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom ye crucified.
044	ACT	002	037	And when they heard this, they were pierced to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, Brethren, what must we do?
044	ACT	002	038	But Peter said to them, Repent, and let every one of you be baptized to the name of Jesus Christ for forgiveness of sins, and ye will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
044	ACT	002	039	For the promise is to you and to your children, and to all that are afar off, as many as the Lord our God shall call.
044	ACT	002	040	And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this perverse generation.
044	ACT	002	041	They therefore received his word, and were baptized; and there were added on that day about three thousand souls.
044	ACT	002	042	And they were constantly attending on the teaching of the apostles, and the imparting [[of their substance]], the breaking of bread, and the prayers.
044	ACT	002	043	And fear came upon every soul; and many wonders and signs were wrought through the apostles.
044	ACT	002	044	And all that believed were together, and had all things common;
044	ACT	002	045	and they sold their possessions and goods, and divided them among all, as any one had need.
044	ACT	002	046	And attending daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread in a private house, they partook of their food with gladness and singleness of heart,
044	ACT	002	047	praising God, and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily those who were in the way of salvation.
044	ACT	003	001	And Peter and John were going up together to the temple, at the hour of prayer, which is the ninth hour.
044	ACT	003	002	And a certain man lame from his birth was carried along, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of those who entered the temple;
044	ACT	003	003	who, seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, asked alms.
044	ACT	003	004	And Peter fixing his eyes upon him, with John, said, Look upon us.
044	ACT	003	005	And he gave heed to them, expecting to receive something from them.
044	ACT	003	006	Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but what I have I give thee. In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, rise up and walk.
044	ACT	003	007	And grasping him by the right hand, he raised him up; and immediately his feet and ankles received strength.
044	ACT	003	008	And leaping forth he stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking and leaping, praising God.
044	ACT	003	009	And all the people saw him walking, and praising God;
044	ACT	003	010	and they recognized him as the man that sat for alms at the Beautiful Gate of the temple; and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened to him.
044	ACT	003	011	And as he held fast to Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the porch that is called Solomon's greatly wondering.
044	ACT	003	012	But Peter seeing it, answered the people: Men of Israel, why wonder ye at this? Or why look ye earnestly on us, as though by our own power or godliness we had made this man to walk?
044	ACT	003	013	The God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his servant Jesus, whom ye indeed delivered up, and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he had decided to release him.
044	ACT	003	014	But ye denied the holy and righteous one, and asked that a murderer should be granted to you.
044	ACT	003	015	But the author of life ye killed; whom God raised from the dead, whereof we are witnesses.
044	ACT	003	016	And his name, through faith in his name, made this man strong, whom ye see and know; yea, the faith which is through him gave him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.
044	ACT	003	017	And now, brethren, I know that ye acted in ignorance, as did also your rulers.
044	ACT	003	018	But God thus fulfilled what he had before announced by the mouth of all the prophets, that his Christ should suffer.
044	ACT	003	019	Repent therefore and turn from your ways, that your sins may be blotted out, in order that the times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord,
044	ACT	003	020	and that he may send forth Christ Jesus, who was before appointed for you;
044	ACT	003	021	whom heaven indeed must receive until the times of a restoration of all things; of which times God spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets from the days of old.
044	ACT	003	022	Moses indeed said, “A prophet will the Lord your God raise up to you from among your brethren, as be raised up me; him shall ye hear in all things, whatever he shall speak to you.
044	ACT	003	023	And it shall come to pass, that every soul which doth not hear that prophet shall be utterly destroyed from among the people.”
044	ACT	003	024	And all the prophets also, Samuel and those who followed, as many as spoke, announced these days.
044	ACT	003	025	Ye are the sons of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying to Abraham, “And in thy posterity shall all the families of the earth be blessed.”
044	ACT	003	026	To you first, God, having raised up his servant, sent him to bless you in turning away every one of you from your iniquities.
044	ACT	004	001	And while they were speaking to the people, the priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees came upon them,
044	ACT	004	002	being indignant that they taught the people, and proclaimed in Jesus the resurrection from the dead.
044	ACT	004	003	And they laid hands upon them, and put them in prison until the next day; for it was now evening.
044	ACT	004	004	Many however of those who heard the word believed; and the number of the men became five thousand.
044	ACT	004	005	And it came to pass on the next day, that their rulers and elders and scribes,
044	ACT	004	006	and Annas the high-priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high-priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem.
044	ACT	004	007	And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name, did ye do this?
044	ACT	004	008	Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, Rulers of the people, and elders of Israel!
044	ACT	004	009	If we are this day examined in respect to a good deed done to a cripple, by what means he hath been restored,
044	ACT	004	010	be it known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, —by him doth this man stand here before you sound.
044	ACT	004	011	This is the stone which was set at nought by you the builders, which is become a cornerstone.
044	ACT	004	012	And there is salvation in no other; for there is not another name under heaven, that hath been given among men, by which we must be saved.
044	ACT	004	013	And when they beheld the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and common men, they wondered; and they recognized them as having been with Jesus.
044	ACT	004	014	And seeing the man that had been cured standing with them, they could say nothing in reply.
044	ACT	004	015	But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,
044	ACT	004	016	saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a remarkable sign hath been wrought by them is manifest to all that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it.
044	ACT	004	017	But that it spread no further among the people, let us strictly forbid them with threats to speak any longer in this name to any one.
044	ACT	004	018	And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all, nor teach, in the name of Jesus.
044	ACT	004	019	But Peter and John answered and said to them, Whether it is right in the sight of God to hearken to you rather than to God, judge ye.
044	ACT	004	020	For we cannot but speak the things which we saw and heard.
044	ACT	004	021	So, having further threatened them, they let them go, finding no way to punish them, on account of the people; because all were glorifying God for that which had been done.
044	ACT	004	022	For the man was above forty years old, on whom this sign of the healing had been wrought.
044	ACT	004	023	And being released they went to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said to them.
044	ACT	004	024	And on hearing it, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, thou art he that made heaven and earth and sea, and all things that are in them;
044	ACT	004	025	who by the mouth of thy servant David said, “Why did the heathen rage, and the peoples meditate vain things?
044	ACT	004	026	The kings of the earth came up, and the rulers assembled together, against the Lord, and against his Anointed.”
044	ACT	004	027	For in truth against thy holy servant Jesus, whom thou didst anoint, did both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the gentiles, and the peoples of Israel, assemble in this city,
044	ACT	004	028	to do whatever thy hand and thy will before determined to be done.
044	ACT	004	029	And now, Lord, look upon their threatenings, and grant to thy servants that with all boldness they may speak thy word,
044	ACT	004	030	while thou stretchest forth thy hand to heal, and signs and wonders are wrought through the name of thy holy servant Jesus.
044	ACT	004	031	And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spoke the word of God with boldness.
044	ACT	004	032	And the multitude of those who believed were of one heart, and of one soul; and not one of them said that aught of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common.
044	ACT	004	033	And with great power did the apostles give their testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus; and great grace was upon them all.
044	ACT	004	034	For there was no one among them that was in want; for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,
044	ACT	004	035	and laid them at the feet of the apostles; and distribution was made to every one, according as he had need.
044	ACT	004	036	And Joseph, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is, when interpreted, Son of consolation, ) a Levite, born in Cyprus,
044	ACT	004	037	having land, sold it, and brought the money, and laid it at the feet of the apostles.
044	ACT	005	001	But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession,
044	ACT	005	002	and kept back part of the price, his wife also having knowledge of it; and brought a certain part, and laid it at the feet of the apostles.
044	ACT	005	003	But Peter said, Ananias, why did Satan fill thy heart that thou shouldst lie to the Holy Spirit, and keep back part of the price of the land?
044	ACT	005	004	While it remained, was it not thine own? And after it was sold, was it not in thine own power? Why didst thou conceive this thing in thy heart? Thou didst not lie to men, but to God.
044	ACT	005	005	And Ananias, hearing these words, fell down, and expired. And great fear came on all that heard of it.
044	ACT	005	006	And the young men arose, and wrapt him up, and carried him out, and buried him.
044	ACT	005	007	And it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife, not knowing what had happened, came in.
044	ACT	005	008	Peter said to her, Tell me whether ye sold the land for so much. And she said, Yes, for so much.
044	ACT	005	009	And Peter said to her, Why is it that ye agreed together to try the Spirit of the Lord? Lo! the feet of those who have buried thy husband are at the door, and they will carry thee out.
044	ACT	005	010	And she fell down immediately at his feet, and expired; and the young men, when they came in, found her dead, and carried her out, and buried her by her husband.
044	ACT	005	011	And great fear came upon all the church, and upon all that heard of these things.
044	ACT	005	012	And many signs and wonders were wrought among the people by the hands of the apostles; and they were all with one accord in Solomon's porch.
044	ACT	005	013	But of the rest no one dared to join himself to them. But the people highly honored them;
044	ACT	005	014	and more and more were believers added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women;
044	ACT	005	015	so that in the streets they brought out the sick, and laid them on beds and couches, in order that at least the shadow of Peter, as he passed, might overshadow some of them.
044	ACT	005	016	The multitude also belonging to the cities around came together to Jerusalem bringing the sick, and those plagued by unclean spirits; and they were all healed.
044	ACT	005	017	But the high-priest and all that were with him, which is the sect of the Sadducees, rose up and were filled with indignation,
044	ACT	005	018	and laid hands on the apostles, and put them in the public prison.
044	ACT	005	019	But an angel of the Lord in the night opened the prison-doors, and brought them forth and said,
044	ACT	005	020	Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life.
044	ACT	005	021	And hearing this, they went into the temple at daybreak and taught. But the high-priest and they that were with him came and called together the council, and all the elders of the sons of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought.
044	ACT	005	022	But the officers that came did not find them in the prison; and they returned and brought word,
044	ACT	005	023	saying, The prison we found shut in all security and the keepers standing at the doors: but when we opened them, we found no one within.
044	ACT	005	024	And when the priest, and the captain of the temple, and the chief priests heard these words, they were at a loss concerning them, to what this would come.
044	ACT	005	025	But one came and brought them word, Lo! the men whom ye put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people.
044	ACT	005	026	Then went the captain with the officers, and brought them without violence, that they might not be stoned; for they feared the people.
044	ACT	005	027	And having brought them, they set them before the council. And the high-priest questioned them,
044	ACT	005	028	saying, We strictly commanded you not to teach in this name, and lo! ye have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and mean to bring this man's blood upon us.
044	ACT	005	029	But Peter and the apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men.
044	ACT	005	030	The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew by hanging him on a cross;
044	ACT	005	031	him hath God exalted by his right hand, as a Leader and Saviour, to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.
044	ACT	005	032	And we are his witnesses of these things, and so also is the Holy Spirit which God hath given to those who obey him.
044	ACT	005	033	But when they heard this, they were filled with rage, and were resolving to kill them.
044	ACT	005	034	But there stood up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, in high esteem with all the people, and commanded to put the men forth a little while,
044	ACT	005	035	and said to them [[of the council]], Men of Israel, take heed to yourselves as to what ye are about to do in respect to these men.
044	ACT	005	036	For before these days arose Theudas, boasting himself to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain, and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered, and came to nought.
044	ACT	005	037	After this man arose Judas the Galilaean, in the days of the registering, and drew people away after him; he also perished, and all, as many as obeyed him, were dispersed.
044	ACT	005	038	And now I say to you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone; for if this design or this work be of men, it will come to nought;
044	ACT	005	039	but if it be of God, ye will not be able to overthrow them; lest haply ye be found also fighting against God.
044	ACT	005	040	And they were persuaded by him; and having called the apostles, they beat them, and commanded them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and released them.
044	ACT	005	041	They therefore went away from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame in behalf of that name;
044	ACT	005	042	and every day, in the temple, and in houses, they ceased not to teach, and to publish the glad tidings concerning Jesus the Christ.
044	ACT	006	001	But in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplying, there arose a murmuring of the Hellenists against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.
044	ACT	006	002	And the twelve called the multitude of the disciples to them, and said, It doth not seem to us proper, that we should leave the word of God, and provide for tables.
044	ACT	006	003	Therefore, brethren, look out among you seven men of good repute, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we will appoint over this business;
044	ACT	006	004	but we will give ourselves closely to prayer, and to the ministry of the word.
044	ACT	006	005	And what was said pleased the whole multitude. And they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolaus a proselyte of Antioch,
044	ACT	006	006	whom they set before the apostles; and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.
044	ACT	006	007	And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples in Jerusalem was greatly enlarged; and a great multitude of the priests were obedient to the faith.
044	ACT	006	008	And Stephen, full of grace and power, wrought great wonders and signs among the people.
044	ACT	006	009	But some of those who belonged to the so-called synagogue of the Freedmen, and of the Cyrenaeans and Alexandrians, and of those from Cilicia and Asia, arose and disputed with Stephen;
044	ACT	006	010	and they were not able to resist the wisdom and the Spirit with which he spoke.
044	ACT	006	011	Then they suborned men, who said, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses, and God.
044	ACT	006	012	And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came upon him, and seized him, and brought him to the council,
044	ACT	006	013	and set up false witnesses, who said, This man ceaseth not to speak words against the holy place, and the Law.
044	ACT	006	014	For we have heard him say, This Jesus the Nazarene will destroy this place, and change the customs which Moses delivered to us.
044	ACT	006	015	And all that sat in the council, looking steadily upon him, saw his face like the face of an angel.
044	ACT	007	001	And the high-priest said, Are then these things so?
044	ACT	007	002	And he said, Brethren and fathers, hearken. The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Haran,
044	ACT	007	003	and said to him, “Go forth from thy country and thy kindred, and come into the land which I will show thee.”
044	ACT	007	004	Then came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and dwelt in Haran; and from thence, after his father was dead, he caused him to remove into this land wherein ye now dwell;
044	ACT	007	005	and he gave him no inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on; and he promised to give it to him for a possession, and to his posterity after him, when as yet he had no child.
044	ACT	007	006	And God spoke in this manner: “That his posterity should sojourn in a foreign land, and that they would bring them into bondage, and ill-treat them four hundred years;
044	ACT	007	007	and the nation to which they shall be in bondage will I judge,” said God; “and after that they shall come forth, and shall worship me in this place.”
044	ACT	007	008	And he gave him the covenant of circumcision; and so he begat Isaac, and circumcised him on the eighth day; and Isaac begat Jacob, and Jacob the twelve patriarchs.
044	ACT	007	009	And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt; and God was with him,
044	ACT	007	010	and delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favor and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he made him governor over Egypt, and all his house.
044	ACT	007	011	Now there came a famine over all the land of Egypt and Canaan, and great distress; and our fathers found no Sustenance.
044	ACT	007	012	But Jacob, hearing that there was grain in Egypt, sent out our fathers first.
044	ACT	007	013	And at the second time Joseph was recognized by his brothers, and the kindred of Joseph became known to Pharaoh.
044	ACT	007	014	Then Joseph sent and called his father Jacob to him, and all his kindred, seventy five souls.
044	ACT	007	015	And Jacob went down [[into Egypt]], and died, he and our fathers.
044	ACT	007	016	And they were removed to Shechem, and laid in the tomb that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem.
044	ACT	007	017	But as the time of the promise drew near, which God solemnly made to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,
044	ACT	007	018	until another king arose, who knew not Joseph.
044	ACT	007	019	The same dealt subtly with our race, and ill-treated our fathers, so that they should cast out their infants, that they might not be preserved alive.
044	ACT	007	020	In which time Moses was born, and was exceedingly fair; who was nourished in his father's house three months.
044	ACT	007	021	And when he was cast out, Pharaoh's daughter took him up, and nourished him for herself as a son.
044	ACT	007	022	And Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in his worlds and deeds.
044	ACT	007	023	And when he was forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren, the sons of Israel.
044	ACT	007	024	And seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged him that was oppressed by smiting the Egyptian.
044	ACT	007	025	For he supposed his brethren would understand that God through his hand would give them salvation; but they understood not.
044	ACT	007	026	And the next day he showed himself to them as they were contending, and urged them to peace, saying, Ye are brethren; why do ye wrong one another?
044	ACT	007	027	But he who was wronging his neighbor thrust him away, saying, “Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us?
044	ACT	007	028	Dost thou mean to kill me, as thou didst kill the Egyptian yesterday?”
044	ACT	007	029	And Moses fled at this saying, and became a sojourner in the land of Midian, where he begat two sons.
044	ACT	007	030	And when forty years were completed, there appeared to him in the wilderness of Mount Sinai an angel in the flaming fire of a bush.
044	ACT	007	031	And Moses seeing it wondered at the sight; and as he drew near to behold it, the voice of the Lord came [[to him]],
044	ACT	007	032	saying, “I am the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob.” And Moses trembled and durst not behold.
044	ACT	007	033	And the Lord said to him, “Loose the sandals from thy feet; for the place where thou standest is holy ground.
044	ACT	007	034	I have surely seen the oppression of my people in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and am come down to deliver them; and now, come, I will send thee into Egypt.”
044	ACT	007	035	This Moses, whom they denied, saying, “Who made thee a ruler and a judge?” this very man did God send both as a ruler and a redeemer with the hand of the angel who appeared to him in the bush.
044	ACT	007	036	This very man brought them out, working wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red Sea, and in the wilderness forty years.
044	ACT	007	037	This is the Moses who said to the sons of Israel, “A prophet will God raise up to you from among your brethren, as he raised up me.”
044	ACT	007	038	This is he that was in the assembly in the wilderness with the anger who spake to him on Mount Sinai, and with our fathers; who received the living oracles to give to us;
044	ACT	007	039	to whom our fathers would not be obedient, but thrust him from them, and in their hearts turned back into Egypt,
044	ACT	007	040	saying to Aaron, “Make us gods who shall go before us; for as for this Moses, who brought us out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him.”
044	ACT	007	041	And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice to the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands.
044	ACT	007	042	But God turned away, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the Prophets, “Did ye offer to me slain beasts and sacrifices for forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?
044	ACT	007	043	And ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of the god Rephan, the figures which ye made to worship them; and I will carry you away beyond Babylon.”
044	ACT	007	044	Our fathers had the tabernacle of the testimony in the wilderness, as he that spoke to Moses commanded that he should make it according to the pattern that he had seen;
044	ACT	007	045	which also our fathers received and brought in with Joshua, at their taking possession of the gentiles whom God drove out from before our fathers, until the days of David;
044	ACT	007	046	who found favor before God, and asked that he might find a habitation for the God of Jacob.
044	ACT	007	047	But Solomon built him a house.
044	ACT	007	048	Yet the Most High dwelleth not in [[temples]] made with hands; as saith the prophet,
044	ACT	007	049	“Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool. What house will ye build for me? saith the Lord; or what is the place of my rest?
044	ACT	007	050	Did not my hands make all these things?”
044	ACT	007	051	Stiffnecked, and uncircumcised in heart and ears! ye do always resist the Holy Spirit; as your fathers did, so do ye.
044	ACT	007	052	Which of the prophets did not your fathers persecute? And they slew those who foretold the coming of the righteous one, of whom ye have now become the betrayers and murderers;
044	ACT	007	053	ye who received the Law as ordained through angels, and did not keep it.
044	ACT	007	054	But when they heard these things, their hearts were filled with rage, and they gnashed their teeth at him.
044	ACT	007	055	But, being full of the Holy Spirit, he looked up earnestly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God,
044	ACT	007	056	and said, Lo, I behold the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.
044	ACT	007	057	And they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and rushed upon him with one accord;
044	ACT	007	058	and having cast him out of the city, they stoned him. And the witnesses laid down their garments at the feet of a young man named Saul;
044	ACT	007	059	and they stoned Stephen, making supplication, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.
044	ACT	007	060	And kneeling down he cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And saying this, he fell asleep.
044	ACT	008	001	And Saul was consenting to his death. And there arose on that day a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and all were scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles.
044	ACT	008	002	And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him.
044	ACT	008	003	But Saul ravaged the church, entering house after house, and dragging both men and women, committed them to prison.
044	ACT	008	004	Now those that had been scattered abroad went through the country preaching the word.
044	ACT	008	005	And Philip went down to a city of Samaria, and preached to them the Christ.
044	ACT	008	006	And the multitudes with one accord gave heed to the things spoken by Philip, when they heard and saw the signs which he wrought.
044	ACT	008	007	For from many that had unclean spirits came they out crying with a loud voice; and many that were palsied, and that were lame, were cured.
044	ACT	008	008	And there was great joy in that city.
044	ACT	008	009	But before their arrival a certain man, named Simon, was in the city, a man practising sorcery, and amazing the people of Samaria, saying that he himself was some great person;
044	ACT	008	010	to whom they gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the Power of God, which is called Great.
044	ACT	008	011	And to him they gave heed, because they had for a long time been amazed by his sorceries.
044	ACT	008	012	But when they believed Philip, publishing the glad tidings concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.
044	ACT	008	013	And Simon himself also believed, and having been baptized he continued with Philip, and was amazed when he beheld the miracles and signs which were wrought.
044	ACT	008	014	And the apostles at Jerusalem, hearing that Samaria had received the word of God, sent to them Peter and John;
044	ACT	008	015	who, having come down, prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit.
044	ACT	008	016	For it had not yet fallen upon any of them; but they had only been baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus.
044	ACT	008	017	Then they laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.
044	ACT	008	018	But Simon, seeing that the Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles' hands, offered them money,
044	ACT	008	019	saying, Give me also this power, that on whomever I lay my hands, he may receive the Holy Spirit.
044	ACT	008	020	But Peter said to him, Thy money perish with thee! because thou didst think to obtain the gift of God with money.
044	ACT	008	021	Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter; for thy heart is not right in the sight of God.
044	ACT	008	022	Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray the Lord, if haply the thought of thy heart may be forgiven thee.
044	ACT	008	023	For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity.
044	ACT	008	024	And Simon answering said, Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of the things which ye have spoken may come upon me.
044	ACT	008	025	They then, when they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord, were returning to Jerusalem, and publishing the glad tidings in many villages of the Samaritans.
044	ACT	008	026	But an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, Arise, and go towards the south, to the way that goeth down from Jerusalem to Gaza. This is a desert way.
044	ACT	008	027	And he arose and went; and lo! a man of Ethiopia, a eunuch, a high officer of Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem to worship,
044	ACT	008	028	was returning and sitting in his chariot; and he was reading the prophet Isaiah.
044	ACT	008	029	And the Spirit said to Philip, Go near and join thyself to this chariot.
044	ACT	008	030	And Philip ran up, and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet, and said, Well, but dost thou understand what thou art reading?
044	ACT	008	031	And he said, How can I, unless some one shall guide me? And he invited Philip to come up and sit with him.
044	ACT	008	032	And the passage of the scripture which he was reading was this: “He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so he openeth not his mouth.
044	ACT	008	033	In his humiliation judgment was refused him; and who shall describe his generation? for his life is taken away from the earth.”
044	ACT	008	034	And the eunuch answering said, I pray thee, of whom doth the prophet say this? Of himself, or of some other man?
044	ACT	008	035	And Philip opened his mouth, and beginning with this scripture declared to him the glad tidings concerning Jesus.
044	ACT	008	036	And as they went along the road, they came to a certain water; and the eunuch saith, See, here is water; what is there to hinder my being baptized?
044	ACT	008	038	And he commanded that the chariot should stop; and they both went down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.
044	ACT	008	039	But when they had come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip; and the eunuch saw him no more, for he went on his way rejoicing.
044	ACT	008	040	But Philip was found at Azotus; and passing through, he published the glad tidings in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.
044	ACT	009	001	But Saul, yet breathing out threatening and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest,
044	ACT	009	002	and asked of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any who were of this way of belief, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.
044	ACT	009	003	And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus; and suddenly there shone around a him a light from heaven;
044	ACT	009	004	and he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying to him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?
044	ACT	009	005	And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And he answered, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.
044	ACT	009	006	But arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do.
044	ACT	009	007	And the men that journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing the voice, but seeing no one.
044	ACT	009	008	And Saul arose from the earth; but when his eyes were opened, he saw nothing; and they led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus.
044	ACT	009	009	And he was three days without sight, and neither ate nor drank.
044	ACT	009	010	And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias, and to him the Lord said in a vision, Ananias! And he said, Behold, I am here, Lord.
044	ACT	009	011	And the Lord said to him, Arise, and go into the street called Straight, and inquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul, of Tarsus; for lo! he prayeth,
044	ACT	009	012	and hath seen a man, named Ananias, coming in and putting his hand on him, that he might receive sight.
044	ACT	009	013	But Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how great evils he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem.
044	ACT	009	014	And here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on thy name.
044	ACT	009	015	But the Lord said to him, Go; for this man is to me a chosen vessel, to bear my name before nations, and kings, and the sons of Israel.
044	ACT	009	016	For I myself will show him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake.
044	ACT	009	017	And Ananias went away, and entered the house; and putting his hands on him, he said, Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus who appeared to thee in the way thou camest, hath sent me, that thou mayst receive sight, and be filled with the Holy Spirit.
044	ACT	009	018	And immediately there fell off from his eyes as it were scales; and he received sight, and arose, and was baptized.
044	ACT	009	019	And having taken some food he was strengthened. And he was some days with the disciples in Damascus.
044	ACT	009	020	And immediately he preached Jesus in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God.
044	ACT	009	021	And all that heard him were amazed, and said, Is not this he that destroyed in Jerusalem those who called on this name? And he hath come hither for this purpose, that he may bring them bound to the chief priests.
044	ACT	009	022	But Saul gained still more strength, and confounded the Jews who dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is the Christ.
044	ACT	009	023	But after many days had passed, the Jews took counsel together to kill him;
044	ACT	009	024	but their plot became known to Saul; and they were even watching the gates day and night to kill him.
044	ACT	009	025	But his disciples took him by night, and let him down through the wall, lowering him in a basket.
044	ACT	009	026	And when he had come to Jerusalem, he attempted to join himself to the disciples; and they were all afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple.
044	ACT	009	027	But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and related to them how he had seen the Lord on the road, and that he had spoken to him, and hew he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus.
044	ACT	009	028	And he was with them going in and out at Jerusalem,
044	ACT	009	029	speaking boldly in the name of the Lord. And he often spoke and disputed with the Hellenists; but they were endeavoring to slay him.
044	ACT	009	030	But the brethren obtaining knowledge of it, brought him down to Caesarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus.
044	ACT	009	031	The church therefore throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria had peace, being built up, and walking in the fear of the Lord; and by the exhortation of the Holy Spirit it was greatly increased.
044	ACT	009	032	And it came to pass, that as Peter went through the whole country, he came down also to the saints who dwelt at Lydda.
044	ACT	009	033	And there he found a certain man named AEneas, who had lain on a bed eight years, and was palsied.
044	ACT	009	034	And Peter said to him, AEneas, Jesus the Christ healeth thee; arise, and make thy bed. And he arose immediately.
044	ACT	009	035	And all that dwelt in Lydda and Sharon saw him; and they turned to the Lord.
044	ACT	009	036	Now at Joppa there was a certain disciple named Tabitha, which name being interpreted is the same as Dorcas, that is, Gazelle. This woman was full of good works and alms-deeds which she did.
044	ACT	009	037	And it came to pass in those days, that she fell sick, and died; and when they had washed her, they laid her in an upper chamber.
044	ACT	009	038	And as Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, having heard that Peter was there, sent to him two men with the entreaty, Do not delay to come to us.
044	ACT	009	039	Then Peter arose, and went with them. When he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber; and all the widows came to him weeping, and showing the coats and cloaks which Dorcas made while she was with them.
044	ACT	009	040	But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down and prayed; and turning to the body he said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes; and seeing Peter, she sat up.
044	ACT	009	041	And he gave her his hand, and raised her up; and calling the saints and the widows, he presented her alive.
044	ACT	009	042	And it became known throughout all Joppa; and many believed in the Lord.
044	ACT	009	043	And it came to pass, that he tarried many days in Joppa with one Simon, a tanner.
044	ACT	010	001	Now a certain man in Caesarea, named Cornelius, a centurion of the band called the Italian band,
044	ACT	010	002	a devout man, and one that feared God with all his house, giving much alms to the people, and praying to God always,
044	ACT	010	003	saw in a vision plainly, about the ninth hour of the day, an angel of God coming in to him, and saying to him, Cornelius!
044	ACT	010	004	And he, looking steadily at him, and becoming affrighted, said, What is it, Lord? And he said to him, Thy prayers and thine alms have come up for a memorial before God.
044	ACT	010	005	And now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, who is surnamed Peter;
044	ACT	010	006	he lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the seaside.
044	ACT	010	007	And when the angel that spoke to him had departed, he called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of those who waited on him,
044	ACT	010	008	and having told them every thing sent them to Joppa.
044	ACT	010	009	On the morrow, as they were on their journey, and were drawing near the city, Peter went up on the housetop to pray, about the sixth hour.
044	ACT	010	010	And he became very hungry and wished to eat; but while they were making ready, a trance came upon him,
044	ACT	010	011	and he beheld heaven opened, and a sort of vessel descending, as it were a large sheet having cords at the four corners, and let down upon the earth;
044	ACT	010	012	wherein were all the four-footed beasts and creeping things of the earth, and birds of the air.
044	ACT	010	013	And there came a voice to him, Arise, Peter; slay, and eat.
044	ACT	010	014	But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten anything common and unclean.
044	ACT	010	015	And a voice came to him again, the second time, That which God hath cleansed, call not thou common.
044	ACT	010	016	This was done three times; and the vessel was immediately taken up into heaven.
044	ACT	010	017	Now, while Peter was doubting within himself what the vision which he had seen meant, lo! the men who were sent from Cornelius had made inquiry for Simon's house, and stood before the gate;
044	ACT	010	018	and they called, and asked whether Simon, surnamed Peter, lodged there.
044	ACT	010	019	And while Peter was meditating on the vision, the Spirit said to him, Behold, men are seeking thee;
044	ACT	010	020	but arise, and go down, and go with them, without scruple; for I have sent them.
044	ACT	010	021	And Peter went down to the men and said, Behold, I am he whom ye are seeking; for what cause have ye come?
044	ACT	010	022	And they said, Cornelius a centurion, a righteous man, and one that feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by a holy angel to send for thee to his house, and to hear words from thee.
044	ACT	010	023	Then he called them in, and lodged them. And on the morrow he arose and went forth with them, and certain of the brethren from Joppa accompanied him.
044	ACT	010	024	And the morrow after, he came into Caesarea. And Cornelius was expecting them, and had called together his kinsmen and near friends.
044	ACT	010	025	And as Peter came in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and did him reverence.
044	ACT	010	026	But Peter raised him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man.
044	ACT	010	027	And while talking with him, he went in, and found many who had come together.
044	ACT	010	028	And he said to them, Ye know that it is an unlawful thing for a Jew to keep company with one of another nation, or to come near him; but God showed me that I should not call any man common or unclean.
044	ACT	010	029	Wherefore I came without objection, when sent for. I ask therefore, for what reason did ye send for me?
044	ACT	010	030	And Cornelius said, Four days ago, I was fasting till this hour; and at the ninth hour was praying in my house; and lo! a man stood before me in bright clothing,
044	ACT	010	031	and said, Cornelius, thy prayer hath been heard, and thine alms have been remembered before God.
044	ACT	010	032	Send therefore to Joppa, and call for Simon, who is surnamed Peter; he lodgeth in the house of Simon a tanner, by the sea-side; and he, when he cometh, will speak to thee.
044	ACT	010	033	I therefore sent to thee immediately; and thou hast done well in coming here. Now therefore we are all present before God, to hear all things that have been commanded thee from the Lord.
044	ACT	010	034	And Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is not a respecter of persons,
044	ACT	010	035	but in every nation he that feareth him and worketh righteousness is acceptable to him—
044	ACT	010	036	the word which he sent to the sons of Israel, publishing glad tidings of peace through Jesus Christ; he is Lord of all men.
044	ACT	010	037	Ye yourselves know what was spoken of through the whole of Judaea, beginning from Galilee after the baptism which John preached,
044	ACT	010	038	relating to Jesus of Nazareth, that God anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with power; who went about doing good, and healing all that were overpowered by the Devil; for God was with him.
044	ACT	010	039	And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem; whom they also slew by hanging him on a cross.
044	ACT	010	040	Him God raised up on the third day, and caused him to be manifested,
044	ACT	010	041	not to all the people, but to witnesses before appointed by God, to ourselves, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead;
044	ACT	010	042	and he commanded us to preach to the people, and to testify that it is he who hath been appointed by God to be judge of the living and the dead.
044	ACT	010	043	To him all the prophets bear witness, that through his name every one that believeth in him shall receive forgiveness of sins.
044	ACT	010	044	While Peter was yet speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all that heard the word.
044	ACT	010	045	And those of the circumcision who believed, as many as came with Peter, were astonished that on the gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Spirit;
044	ACT	010	046	for they heard them speaking with tongues, and magnifying God. Then answered Peter,
044	ACT	010	047	Can any one forbid water, that these should not be baptized, who have received the Holy Spirit even as we have?
044	ACT	010	048	And he commanded that they should be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then they entreated him to remain some days.
044	ACT	011	001	And the apostles and the brethren throughout Judaea heard that the gentiles also had received the word of God.
044	ACT	011	002	And when Peter went up to Jerusalem, they that were of the circumcision contended with him,
044	ACT	011	003	saying, Thou didst go in to men uncircumcised, and didst eat with them.
044	ACT	011	004	But Peter rehearsed the matter to them in order from the beginning, saying,
044	ACT	011	005	I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision, a sort of vessel descending, as it were a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners, and it came even to me;
044	ACT	011	006	on which fixing my eyes, I observed, and saw the four-footed beasts of the earth, and the wild beasts, and the creeping things, and the birds of the air.
044	ACT	011	007	And I also heard a voice saying to me, Arise, Peter; slay and eat.
044	ACT	011	008	But I said, Not so, Lord; for nothing common or unclean ever entered my mouth.
044	ACT	011	009	But a voice answered the second time out of heaven, That which God hath cleansed, call not thou common.
044	ACT	011	010	And this was done three times; and all were again drawn up into heaven.
044	ACT	011	011	And lo! immediately there stood three men at the house where I was, having been sent to me from Caesarea.
044	ACT	011	012	And the Spirit bade me go with them. And these six brethren also came with me, and we entered the man's house.
044	ACT	011	013	And he told us how he had seen the angel in his house, standing and saying to him, Send to Joppa, and call for Simon, surnamed Peter;
044	ACT	011	014	who will speak to thee words by which thou shalt be saved, and all thy house.
044	ACT	011	015	And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them, as on us at the beginning.
044	ACT	011	016	And I remembered the word of the Lord, that he said, John indeed baptized with water, but ye shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit.
044	ACT	011	017	Since then God gave the like gift to them as to us, on believing in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I, that I could withstand God?
044	ACT	011	018	And when they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, So then to the gentiles also God hath granted repentance unto life.
044	ACT	011	019	Now they who were scattered abroad by the persecution that arose on account of Stephen traveled as far as Phenicia, and Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the word to none but Jews.
044	ACT	011	020	But some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who, when they had come to Antioch, spoke to the Greeks, publishing the glad tidings of the Lord Jesus.
044	ACT	011	021	And the hand of the Lord was with them; and a great number believed, and turned to the Lord.
044	ACT	011	022	But the talk concerning them came to the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem; and they sent forth Barnabas, to go as far as Antioch;
044	ACT	011	023	who, when he came, and saw the grace of God, rejoiced, and exhorted all to cleave to the Lord with purpose of heart;
044	ACT	011	024	for he was a good man, and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. And a great multitude was added to the Lord.
044	ACT	011	025	And he went to Tarsus, to seek for Saul;
044	ACT	011	026	and when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. And it came to pass, that for a whole year they came together in the church, and taught a great multitude; and the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch.
044	ACT	011	027	And in those days prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.
044	ACT	011	028	And one of them named Agabus stood up, and signified by the Spirit, that there was about to be a great famine over the whole world; which came to pass in the days of Claudius.
044	ACT	011	029	And according as any one of the disciples was prospered, they determined every one of them to send relief to the brethren who dwelt in Judaea;
044	ACT	011	030	which also they did, sending it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.
044	ACT	012	001	Now about that time, Herod the king laid his hands upon certain of the church, to oppress them.
044	ACT	012	002	And he slew James, the brother of John, with the sword.
044	ACT	012	003	And seeing that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to apprehend Peter also; (then were the days of unleavened bread; )
044	ACT	012	004	and he seized him and put him in prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him; intending after the passover to bring him forth to the people.
044	ACT	012	005	Peter therefore was kept guarded in prison; but earnest prayer was made by the church to God in his behalf.
044	ACT	012	006	And when Herod was about to bring him forth, on that night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and keepers before the door were guarding the prison.
044	ACT	012	007	And lo! an angel of the Lord came to him, and a light shone in the room; and he smote Peter on the side, and roused him, saying, Rise up quickly. And his chains fell from his hands.
044	ACT	012	008	And the angel said to him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals; and he did so. And he saith to him, Throw thy garment round thee, and follow me.
044	ACT	012	009	And he went out, and followed; and he knew not that what was done by the angel was real, but thought he saw a vision.
044	ACT	012	010	And when they had passed the first, and the second guard, they came to the iron gate that leadeth to the city, which opened to them of itself; and they went out and passed on through one street, and the angel immediately departed from him.
044	ACT	012	011	And when Peter had come to himself, he said, Now I know certainly, that the Lord hath sent forth his angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews.
044	ACT	012	012	And when he understood the matter, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, surnamed Mark, where many were gathered together, and praying.
044	ACT	012	013	And as he knocked at the door of the gate, a maid-servant came to listen, named Rhoda;
044	ACT	012	014	and recognizing Peter's voice, she opened not the gate for gladness; but ran in, and told them that Peter was standing before the gate.
044	ACT	012	015	And they said to her, Thou art mad. But she positively affirmed that it was even so. Then they said, It is his angel.
044	ACT	012	016	But Peter continued knocking; and opening the door, they saw him, and were amazed.
044	ACT	012	017	But beckoning to them with his hand to be silent, he related how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, Go and tell these things to James, and to the brethren. And he departed, and went to another place.
044	ACT	012	018	And when it was day, there was no small commotion among the soldiers, as to what had become of Peter.
044	ACT	012	019	And Herod, when he had sought for him and found him not, examined the keepers, and commanded that they should be led away [[to execution]]. And he went down from Judea to Caesarea, and there abode.
044	ACT	012	020	And he was highly displeased with the Tyrians and Sidonians; but they came to him with one accord, and having made Blastus the king's chamberlain their friend, sued for peace; because their country drew its nourishment from that of the king.
044	ACT	012	021	And on a day appointed, Herod, having arrayed himself in royal apparel, and taken his seat on the throne, made a speech to them.
044	ACT	012	022	And thereupon the people shouted, The voice of a god, and not of a man!
044	ACT	012	023	But immediately an angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not God the glory, and he was eaten by worms, and expired.
044	ACT	012	024	But the word of God grew and was extended.
044	ACT	012	025	And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, having performed their service, taking with them also John, surnamed Mark.
044	ACT	013	001	Now there were at Antioch, in the church that was there, prophets and teachers; Barnabas, and Simeon who was called Niger, and Lucius the Cyrenaean, and Manaen, the foster-brother of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.
044	ACT	013	002	And while they were ministering to the Lord, and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.
044	ACT	013	003	Then, after they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.
044	ACT	013	004	They therefore being sent forth by the Holy Spirit, came down to Seleucia, and from thence sailed to Cyprus.
044	ACT	013	005	And having come to Salamis, they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews; and they had also John as an assistant.
044	ACT	013	006	And when they had gone through the whole island as far as Paphos, they found a certain magian, a Jewish false prophet, whose name was Bar-jesus,
044	ACT	013	007	who was with the proconsul of the country, Sergius Paulus, an intelligent man. He, having called for Barnabas and Saul, desired to hear the word of God.
044	ACT	013	008	But Elymas the magian (for so is his name interpreted) withstood them, seeking so turn away the proconsul from the faith.
044	ACT	013	009	But Saul (who is also called Paul), filled with the Holy Spirit, fixed his eyes on him
044	ACT	013	010	and said, O full of all deceit, and of all mischief, son of the Devil, enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?
044	ACT	013	011	And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou wilt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And immediately there fell on him a mist and darkness; and going about he sought to find some who would lead him by the hand.
044	ACT	013	012	Then the proconsul, when he saw what had taken place, believed, being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord.
044	ACT	013	013	And Paul and his company, having put to sea from Paphos, came to Perga in Pamphylia. But John, departing from them, returned to Jerusalem.
044	ACT	013	014	And they, going on from Perga, came to Antioch in Pisidia; and they went into the synagogue on the sabbath-day, and sat down.
044	ACT	013	015	And after the reading of the Law and the Prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent to them, saying, Brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation for the people, speak.
044	ACT	013	016	Then Paul stood up, and beckoned with his hand and said, Men of Israel, and ye that fear God, hearken.
044	ACT	013	017	The God of this people chose our fathers, and he exalted the people in their sojourn in the land of Egypt, and with a high arm he brought them out of it;
044	ACT	013	018	and for about forty years he nourished them in the wilderness.
044	ACT	013	019	And having destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave them their land as a possession.
044	ACT	013	020	And after that, for about four hundred and fifty years, he gave judges, until Samuel the prophet.
044	ACT	013	021	And afterward they asked for a king; and God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years;
044	ACT	013	022	and having removed him, he raised up to them David to be their king, to whom he gave testimony, saying, “I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after my own heart, who will do all my will.”
044	ACT	013	023	From the seed of this man hath God, according to his promise, brought to Israel a Saviour, Jesus;
044	ACT	013	024	before whose coming forward John had first preached a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.
044	ACT	013	025	And as John was finishing his course, he said, Who do ye think that I am? I am not He. But lo I there cometh after me one, the sandal of whose feet I am not worthy to loose.
044	ACT	013	026	Brethren, sons of the stock of Abraham, and those among you who fear God, to you was the word of this salvation sent forth.
044	ACT	013	027	For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, not knowing him, nor the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath, fulfilled them in condemning him.
044	ACT	013	028	And though they found nothing deserving death in him, they asked of Pilate that he should be slain.
044	ACT	013	029	And when they had accomplished all that was written of him, they took him down from the cross, and laid him in a tomb.
044	ACT	013	030	But God raised him from the dead,
044	ACT	013	031	and he was seen for many days by those who came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are now his witnesses to the people.
044	ACT	013	032	And we declare to you the glad tidings, that the promise which was made to the fathers
044	ACT	013	033	God hath fulfilled to us their children, in raising up Jesus [[from the dead]]; as it is also written in the first Psalm: “Thou art my Son; I have this day begotten thee.”
044	ACT	013	034	And that he raised him up from the dead, no more to return to corruption, he hath thus spoken: “I will give you the sure holy things promised to David.”
044	ACT	013	035	Wherefore also in another Psalm he saith, “Thou wilt not suffer thy holy one to see corruption:”
044	ACT	013	036	For David, after having in his own generation served the will of God, fell asleep, and was added to his fathers, and saw corruption;
044	ACT	013	037	but he whom God raised from the dead did not see corruption.
044	ACT	013	038	Be it therefore known to you, brethren, that through this man is announced to you the forgiveness of sins;
044	ACT	013	039	and by him every one that believeth is justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses.
044	ACT	013	040	Beware therefore, lest that come upon you which is spoken in the Prophets,
044	ACT	013	041	“Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish! for I work a work in your days, a work which ye will not believe, though one should plainly declare it to you.”
044	ACT	013	042	And as they were going out, they besought that these words might be spoken to them on the next sabbath.
044	ACT	013	043	And when the synagogue broke up, many of the Jews and proselyte worshippers followed Paul and Barnabas; who, speaking to them, exhorted them to continue in the grace of God.
044	ACT	013	044	And on the next sabbath almost the whole city came together to hear the word of the Lord.
044	ACT	013	045	But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with indignation, and spoke against what was spoken by Paul, contradicting and reviling.
044	ACT	013	046	Then Paul and Barnabas said boldly and plainly, It was necessary that the word of God should first be spoken to you; but seeing ye thrust it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of the everlasting life, lo! we turn to the gentiles.
044	ACT	013	047	For thus hath the Lord commanded us: “I have set thee to be a light of the gentiles, that thou mayst bring salvation even to the end of the earth.”
044	ACT	013	048	And when the gentiles heard this, they rejoiced, and glorified the word of the Lord; and as many as were ordained to everlasting life, believed.
044	ACT	013	049	And the word of the Lord was spread abroad throughout the whole country.
044	ACT	013	050	But the Jews stirred up the women of rank who worshipped God, and the chief men of the city, and raised a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and drove them from their borders.
044	ACT	013	051	But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came to Iconium.
044	ACT	013	052	And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.
044	ACT	014	001	And it came to pass in Iconium, that they went together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spoke that a great multitude both of Jews and Greeks believed.
044	ACT	014	002	But the Jews that disbelieved stirred up and embittered the minds of the gentiles against the brethren.
044	ACT	014	003	They abode therefore a long time there, speaking boldly in reliance on the Lord, who gave testimony to the word of his grace, granting signs and wonders to be wrought by their a hands.
044	ACT	014	004	But the multitude of the city was divided; and some held with the Jews, and some with the apostles.
044	ACT	014	005	And when a movement was made both of the gentiles, and the Jews with their rulers, to abuse and stone them,
044	ACT	014	006	they became aware of it, and fled to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra and Derbe, and the neighboring country;
044	ACT	014	007	and they were publishing the glad tidings there.
044	ACT	014	008	And at Lystra there sat a certain man who had not the use of his feet, a cripple from his birth, who never had walked.
044	ACT	014	009	This man heard Paul speaking; who looking steadily at him, and perceiving that he had faith to be healed,
044	ACT	014	010	said with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet. And he leaped up and walked.
044	ACT	014	011	And the multitudes, seeing what Paul had done, lifted up their voices, saying, in the language of Lycaonia, The gods have come down to us in the likeness of men.
044	ACT	014	012	And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercury, because he was the chief speaker.
044	ACT	014	013	Then the priest of Jupiter, that was in front of the city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates, and would have offered sacrifice with the multitudes.
044	ACT	014	014	But the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, when they heard of it, rent their garments, and rushed forth to the multitude, crying out
044	ACT	014	015	and saying, Men, why do ye these things? We also are men of like nature with you, bringing to you glad tidings, that ye may turn from these vanities to the living God, who made heaven and earth and sea, and all things that are therein;
044	ACT	014	016	who in the ages past suffered all the nations to walk in their own ways;
044	ACT	014	017	although he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, giving you rain from heaven and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with food and gladness.
044	ACT	014	018	And with these words, they hardly restrained the multitudes from sacrificing to them.
044	ACT	014	019	But there came thither Jews from Antioch and Iconium; who, having persuaded the multitudes, and stoned Paul, dragged him out of the city, supposing him to be dead.
044	ACT	014	020	But the disciples having gathered around him, he rose up, and came into the city. And the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe.
044	ACT	014	021	And when they had published the glad tidings to that city, and had made many disciples, they went back to Lystra, and to Iconium, and to Antioch;
044	ACT	014	022	confirming the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to continue in the faith, and saying that it is through many afflictions that we mast enter into the kingdom of God.
044	ACT	014	023	And having appointed for them elders in every church, they prayed with fasting, and commended them to the Lord, in whom they believed.
044	ACT	014	024	And having gone through Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia;
044	ACT	014	025	and when they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia,
044	ACT	014	026	and thence set sail for Antioch, whence they had been commended to the grace of God, for the work which they had accomplished.
044	ACT	014	027	And when they had arrived and had gathered the church together, they related what great things God had wrought with them, and that he had opened a door of faith to the gentiles.
044	ACT	014	028	And they abode no little time with the disciples.
044	ACT	015	001	And there came down certain men from Judaea, and taught the brethren, Unless ye are circumcised after the custom of Moses, ye cannot be saved.
044	ACT	015	002	But when Paul and Barnabas had had no small dissension and debate with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain others of them, should go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and elders about this question.
044	ACT	015	003	They therefore, having been sent forward by the church, passed through Phoenicia and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the gentiles; and they caused great joy to all the brethren.
044	ACT	015	004	And having come to Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church, and by the apostles and elders, and they related what great things God had wrought with them.
044	ACT	015	005	But there rose up certain believers of the sect of the Pharisees, saying, It is necessary to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses.
044	ACT	015	006	And the apostles and the elders came together to consider this matter.
044	ACT	015	007	And after much debate, Peter rose up and said to them, Brethren, ye know that a long time ago God made choice among you, that by my mouth the gentiles should hear the word of the glad tidings, and believe.
044	ACT	015	008	And God, who knoweth the heart, bore them witness, giving them the Holy Spirit, as he gave it to us;
044	ACT	015	009	and made no difference between us and them, having purified their hearts by faith.
044	ACT	015	010	Now therefore why do ye provoke the anger of God, by putting a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?
044	ACT	015	011	But we believe that we shall be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, in the same manner as they.
044	ACT	015	012	And all the multitude became silent, and listened to Barnabas and Paul, while they related what great signs and wonders God had wrought among the gentiles by them.
044	ACT	015	013	And after they had done speaking, James answered, saying, Brethren, hearken to me.
044	ACT	015	014	Simeon hath related how God first visited the gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name.
044	ACT	015	015	And with this agree the words of the Prophets, as it is written:
044	ACT	015	016	“After this I will return, and will rebuild the tabernacle of David which hath fallen; and I will rebuild its ruins, and will set it up;
044	ACT	015	017	that the rest of men may seek after the Lord, and all the gentiles, who have been called by my name, saith the Lord, who doeth these things,
044	ACT	015	018	which were known from the beginning.”
044	ACT	015	019	Wherefore my judgment is, that we should not trouble those who from among the gentiles are turning to God;
044	ACT	015	020	but that we should write to them by letter to abstain from pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from that which hath been strangled, and from blood.
044	ACT	015	021	For Moses from the times of old hath had in every city those who preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath.
044	ACT	015	022	Then it was decided by the apostles and the elders, with the whole church, to choose men from among themselves, and send them to Antioch, with Paul and Barnabas, namely, Judas called Barsabbas, and Silas, leading men among the brethren.
044	ACT	015	023	And they wrote by them, “The apostles, and the elders, and the brethren, to the brethren who are from the gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia, greeting.
044	ACT	015	024	Whereas we have heard, that some who went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, to whom we gave no command;
044	ACT	015	025	it seemed good to us, having become of one mind, to choose men and send them to you, with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,
044	ACT	015	026	men who have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
044	ACT	015	027	We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who will themselves tell you the same things by word of mouth.
044	ACT	015	028	For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us, to lay upon you no further burden except these necessary things:
044	ACT	015	029	to abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication; from which if ye keep yourselves, ye will do well. Farewell.”
044	ACT	015	030	They therefore being sent away came to Antioch; and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the letter.
044	ACT	015	031	And when they had read it, they rejoiced over the encouragement.
044	ACT	015	032	And Judas and Silas, who were themselves prophets, exhorted the brethren with many words and confirmed them.
044	ACT	015	033	And when they had remained some time, they were dismissed with peace from the brethren to those who sent them.
044	ACT	015	035	But Paul and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and publishing, with many others also, the glad tidings of the word of the Lord.
044	ACT	015	036	And some days after, Paul said to Barnabas, Let us go again and visit the brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord, and see how they are.
044	ACT	015	037	And Barnabas determined to take with them John, called Mark.
044	ACT	015	038	But Paul did not think it proper to take with them a man who had left them in Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.
044	ACT	015	039	And there arose a sharp contention, so that they parted from each other, and Barnabas took Mark and sailed to Cyprus.
044	ACT	015	040	And Paul chose Silas and went forth, having been commended by the brethren to the grace of the Lord.
044	ACT	015	041	And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.
044	ACT	016	001	And he came to Derbe and Lystra; and lo! a certain disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a believing Jewess, but whose father was a Greek;
044	ACT	016	002	who was well a spoken of by the brethren in Lystra and Iconium.
044	ACT	016	003	Him Paul wished to go forth with him, and took and circumcised him on account of the Jews who were in those places; for they all knew that his father was a Greek.
044	ACT	016	004	And as they journeyed through the cities, they delivered to them for their observance the decrees which had been ordained by the apostles and elders that were at Jerusalem.
044	ACT	016	005	The churches therefore were established in the faith, and increased in number daily.
044	ACT	016	006	And having gone through Phrygia and the Galatian country, on being forbidden by the Holy Spirit to preach the word in Asia,
044	ACT	016	007	they came to Mysia, and were attempting to go into Bithynia; but the Spirit of Jesus did not permit them.
044	ACT	016	008	And passing by Mysia, they came to Troas.
044	ACT	016	009	And a vision appeared to Paul in the night. There stood a man of Macedonia beseeching him and saying, Come over into Macedonia and help us.
044	ACT	016	010	And when he had seen the vision, we immediately endeavored to go into Macedonia, concluding that the Lord had called us to publish the glad tidings to them.
044	ACT	016	011	And setting sail from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothrace, and on the day following to Neapolis;
044	ACT	016	012	and thence to Philippi, which is a chief city of the province of Macedonia, a colony. And we remained in the city some days.
044	ACT	016	013	And on the sabbath-day we went forth out of the gate to a river-side, where was wont to be a place of prayer, and we sat down, and spoke to the women who had assembled.
044	ACT	016	014	And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, who worshipped God, was listening; whose heart the Lord opened to attend to the things which were spoken by Paul.
044	ACT	016	015	And when she had been baptized, and her household, she besought us, saying, If ye have judged me to be a believer in the Lord, come into my house, and abide. And she constrained us.
044	ACT	016	016	And it came to pass, as we were going to the place of prayer, that a certain bond-maid having a soothsaying spirit met us, who brought her masters much gain by soothsaying.
044	ACT	016	017	This woman followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, who announce to you the way of salvation.
044	ACT	016	018	And this she did for many days. But Paul, being much displeased, turned and said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And it came out immediately.
044	ACT	016	019	But her masters seeing that the hope of their gain was gone, laid hold of Paul and Silas, and dragged them into the market-place to the rulers;
044	ACT	016	020	and having brought them before the magistrates, said, These men are grievously disturbing our city, being Jews;
044	ACT	016	021	and they teach customs which it is not lawful for us Romans to receive or observe.
044	ACT	016	022	And the multitude rose up together against them, and the magistrates, tearing off their clothes, commanded to beat them with rods;
044	ACT	016	023	and when they had laid on them many stripes, they cast them into prison, charging the jailer to keep them safely;
044	ACT	016	024	who having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.
044	ACT	016	025	But at midnight Paul and Silas praying, were singing praises to God; and the prisoners were listening to them.
044	ACT	016	026	And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and all the doors were immediately opened, and the bands of all were loosed.
044	ACT	016	027	And the jailer awakening out of sleep, and seeing the prison-doors open, drew his sword, and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped.
044	ACT	016	028	But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm, for we are all here.
044	ACT	016	029	Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and fell down trembling before Paul and Silas;
044	ACT	016	030	and having brought them out, he said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?
044	ACT	016	031	And they said, Believe in the Lord Jesus, and thou wilt be saved, and thy household.
044	ACT	016	032	And they spoke to him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his house.
044	ACT	016	033	And he took them with him at that hour of the night, and washed their stripes; and he was immediately baptized, himself and all that belonged to him.
044	ACT	016	034	And when he had brought them up into his house, he set food before them, and rejoiced with all his house, having become a believer in God.
044	ACT	016	035	And when it was day, the magistrates sent the sergeants, saying, Release those men.
044	ACT	016	036	And the jailer reported these words to Paul: The magistrates have sent to release you; now therefore come out, and go in peace.
044	ACT	016	037	But Paul said to them, They have publicly beaten us uncondemned, although we are Romans, and have thrust us into prison; and now do they thrust us out secretly? No; but let them come themselves, and bring us out.
044	ACT	016	038	And the sergeants reported these words to the magistrates; and they were afraid when they heard that they were Romans.
044	ACT	016	039	And they came and besought them; and when they had brought them out, they entreated them to leave the city.
044	ACT	016	040	And when they had come out of the prison, they went into the house of Lydia; and when they saw the brethren, they exhorted them, and departed.
044	ACT	017	001	And when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was the synagogue of the Jews.
044	ACT	017	002	And Paul, as his custom was, went in among them, and for three sabbaths discoursed to them out of the Scriptures,
044	ACT	017	003	explaining them, and setting forth that it was necessary for the Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead, and that “this is the Christ, —Jesus whom I am making known to you.”
044	ACT	017	004	And some of them were convinced, and joined themselves to Paul and Silas, and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the women of high rank not a few.
044	ACT	017	005	But the unbelieving Jews, taking with them certain bad men of the idlers in the market-place, and gathering a crowd, set the city in an uproar; and having come to the house of Jason, they endeavored to bring them out to the people;
044	ACT	017	006	but not finding them, they dragged Jason and some of the brethren before the city magistrates, crying out, These men that have turned the world upside down have come hither also;
044	ACT	017	007	whom Jason hath entertained; and they are all acting in opposition to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, Jesus.
044	ACT	017	008	And they alarmed the multitude and the city magistrates when they heard these things.
044	ACT	017	009	And having taken security of Jason and of the others, they let them go.
044	ACT	017	010	And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night to Berea; who, having come there, went into the synagogue of the Jews.
044	ACT	017	011	These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness, and searched the Scriptures daily, whether these things were so.
044	ACT	017	012	Many of them therefore believed; and of the Grecian women of rank and men, not a few.
044	ACT	017	013	But when the Jews of Thessalonica knew that at Beroea, too, the word of God was preached by Paul, they came hither also, and stirred up the multitudes.
044	ACT	017	014	And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go to the sea; but Silas and Timothy remained there.
044	ACT	017	015	And they who conducted Paul brought him to Athens; and having received a commandment to Silas and Timothy to come to him as soon as possible, they departed.
044	ACT	017	016	Now while Paul was waiting for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred within him, when he saw the city full of idols.
044	ACT	017	017	Therefore he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and the devout [[Greeks]], and in the market daily with those that met him.
044	ACT	017	018	And some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers also conversed with him. And some said, What doth this babbler mean to say? and others, He seemeth to be a setter forth of foreign gods; because he brought the glad tidings of Jesus and the resurrection.
044	ACT	017	019	And they took him and brought him to Mars' hill, saying, May we know what this new doctrine is, of which thou speakest?
044	ACT	017	020	For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears. We would know therefore what these things mean.
044	ACT	017	021	Now all the Athenians, and the strangers residing among them, spent their leisure for nothing else but to tell or to hear something new.
044	ACT	017	022	Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars' hill, and said, Men of Athens, in all things I perceive that ye are very devout.
044	ACT	017	023	For while passing along and observing your objects of worship, I found also an altar with this inscription, “To an unknown God.” What therefore ye, without knowledge of it, worship, that do I make known to you.
044	ACT	017	024	The God who made the world and all things therein, he, being Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;
044	ACT	017	025	nor doth he receive service at the hands of men, as though he needed anything, since it is he that giveth to all life and breath and all things.
044	ACT	017	026	And he made of one blood every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, having fixed appointed times, and the bounds of their habitation;
044	ACT	017	027	that they should seek God, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he is not far from every one of us.
044	ACT	017	028	For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as also some of your own poets have said: “For we are also his offspring.”
044	ACT	017	029	Being then the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Deity is like to gold or silver or stone, graven by the art and device of man.
044	ACT	017	030	The times indeed of ignorance God overlooked; but now commandeth all men every where to repent;
044	ACT	017	031	inasmuch as he hath fixed a day, in which he will judge the world in righteousness by a man whom he hath appointed; having given assurance to all by raising him from the dead.
044	ACT	017	032	And when they heard of a resurrection of the dead, some mocked; but ethers said, We will hear thee again about this matter.
044	ACT	017	033	Thus Paul departed from among them.
044	ACT	017	034	But certain men joined themselves to him, and believed; among whom was Dionysius the Areopagite; and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.
044	ACT	018	001	After these things, Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth.
044	ACT	018	002	And having found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, and Priscilla his wife, (because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to depart from Rome, ) he came to them;
044	ACT	018	003	and because he was of the same trade, he abode with them, and worked; for they were tent-makers by trade.
044	ACT	018	004	And he discoursed in the synagogue every sabbath, and endeavored to persuade both Jews and Greeks.
044	ACT	018	005	And when both Silas and Timothy had come from Macedonia, Paul was wholly engaged in the word, testifying to the Jews, that Jesus was the Christ.
044	ACT	018	006	And when they set themselves against him, and reviled, he shook his garments, and said to them, Your blood be upon your own heads! I am clean; from this time I will go to the gentiles.
044	ACT	018	007	And he departed thence, and went to the house of a certain man, named Justus, a worshipper of God, whose house was very near the synagogue.
044	ACT	018	008	And Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians upon hearing believed, and were baptized.
044	ACT	018	009	And the Lord said to Paul through a vision in the night, Be not afraid, but speak on, and be not silent;
044	ACT	018	010	for I am with thee, and no one shall lay hands on thee, to hurt thee; for I have much people in this city.
044	ACT	018	011	And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.
044	ACT	018	012	And when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews rose up with one accord against Paul, and brought him before the judgment-seat,
044	ACT	018	013	saying, This man persuadeth people to worship God contrary to the law.
044	ACT	018	014	And as Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, If it were some act of injustice or wicked misdeed, O Jews, with reason I should bear with you;
044	ACT	018	015	but if it be questions of doctrine, and names, and your law, look to it yourselves; I will not be a judge of these matters.
044	ACT	018	016	And he drove them from the judgment-seat.
044	ACT	018	017	But they all laid hold of Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment-seat; and Gallio cared for none of these things.
044	ACT	018	018	And Paul, having stayed many days longer, took leave of the brethren, and sailed thence to Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila, after he had shaved his head in Cenchreae, for he had a vow.
044	ACT	018	019	And they came to Ephesus, and he left them there; but he himself entered the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.
044	ACT	018	020	And when they asked him to stay longer, he consented not;
044	ACT	018	021	but having taken leave of them, saying, I will return to you, if God will, he set sail from Ephesus.
044	ACT	018	022	And having landed at Caesarea and gone up and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch.
044	ACT	018	023	And after he had spent some time there, he departed, going through the Galatian country and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples.
044	ACT	018	024	And a certain Jew, named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, an eloquent man, and mighty in the Scriptures, came to Ephesus.
044	ACT	018	025	This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in spirit, he spoke and taught correctly the things concerning Jesus, knowing only the baptism of John.
044	ACT	018	026	And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue. But Aquila and Priscilla having heard him, took him to them, and set forth to him the way [[of the Lord]] more fully.
044	ACT	018	027	And when he wished to go over into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to give him welcome; and when he was come, he gave much aid to those who had believed through grace.
044	ACT	018	028	For he publicly confuted the Jews, with power, showing by the Scriptures that Jesus is the Christ.
044	ACT	019	001	And it came to pass, while Apollos was at Corinth, that Paul, having passed through the upper districts, came to Ephesus. And finding certain disciples,
044	ACT	019	002	he said to them, Did ye receive the Holy Spirit when ye believed? And they said to him, No, we did not even hear whether there is a Holy Spirit.
044	ACT	019	003	And he said, Into what then were ye baptized? And they said, Into John's baptism.
044	ACT	019	004	Then said Paul, John indeed baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying to the people, that they should believe on him that was coming after him; that is, on Jesus.
044	ACT	019	005	And when they heard this, they were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus.
044	ACT	019	006	And when Paul bad laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they spoke with tongues, and prophesied.
044	ACT	019	007	And the men were about twelve in all.
044	ACT	019	008	And he went into the synagogue, and spoke boldly for three months, discoursing and persuading concerning the kingdom of God.
044	ACT	019	009	But when some were hardened, and believed not, but spoke evil of the way [[of the Lord]] before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, discoursing daily in the school of Tyrannus.
044	ACT	019	010	And this continued for two years, so that all who dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.
044	ACT	019	011	And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul;
044	ACT	019	012	so that even handkerchiefs, or aprons, were carried from his body to the sick, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out.
044	ACT	019	013	Then some of the wandering Jewish exorcists undertook to name over those who had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, I adjure you by that Jesus whom Paul preacheth.
044	ACT	019	014	And there were seven sons of Scevas, a Jewish chief priest, who did this.
044	ACT	019	015	And the evil spirit answering said, Jesus I knew, and Paul I well know; but who are ye?
044	ACT	019	016	And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them both, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.
044	ACT	019	017	And this became known to all, both Jews and Greeks, who dwelt at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.
044	ACT	019	018	And many of the believers came, confessing and declaring their practices.
044	ACT	019	019	Many also of those who had practised magical arts brought their books together, and burned them before all men; and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.
044	ACT	019	020	So the word of the Lord grew and prevailed mightily.
044	ACT	019	021	And when these things were ended, Paul resolved to pass through Macedonia and Achaia, and to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.
044	ACT	019	022	And having sent into Macedonia two of those who ministered to him, Timothy and Erastus, he himself stayed in Asia for a season.
044	ACT	019	023	And about that time there arose no small tumult concerning the faith.
044	ACT	019	024	For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, made silver shrines of Diana, and brought no small gain to the craftsmen.
044	ACT	019	025	And having called them together, with the workmen of like occupation, he said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth;
044	ACT	019	026	and ye see and hear, that this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much people, not only of Ephesus, but of almost all Asia, saying, that those are not gods, which are made with hands.
044	ACT	019	027	And there is not only danger that this branch of our business will come into disrepute, but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana will be despised, and her magnificence destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worship.
044	ACT	019	028	And hearing this they became full of wrath, and kept crying out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians!
044	ACT	019	029	And the city was filled with confusion; and they rushed with one accord into the theatre, having seized Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's companions in travel.
044	ACT	019	030	And when Paul wished to go in to the people, the disciples would not suffer him.
044	ACT	019	031	And some also of the Asiarchs, who were his friends, sent to him, and entreated him not to venture into the theatre.
044	ACT	019	032	Some therefore were crying one thing, and some another; for the assembly was in confusion, and the greater part knew not wherefore they had come together.
044	ACT	019	033	And they brought forward Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward; and Alexander beckoned with his hand, desiring to make his defence to the people.
044	ACT	019	034	But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice for about two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians!
044	ACT	019	035	But when the Recorder had quieted the multitude, he said, Men of Ephesus, who is there among men that doth not know that the city of the Ephesians is guardian of the great Diana, and of the image which fell down from Jupiter?
044	ACT	019	036	Since then these things cannot be denied, ye ought to be quiet, and do nothing rashly.
044	ACT	019	037	For ye have brought hither these men, who are neither robbers of temples, nor blasphemers of your goddess.
044	ACT	019	038	If then Demetrius and the craftsmen with him have a complaint against any one, the courts are open, and there are proconsuls; let them bring their charges against each other.
044	ACT	019	039	But if ye ask for any thing further, it shall be determined in the lawful assembly.
044	ACT	019	040	For we are in danger of being called to answer concerning this day's riot, there being no ground on which we shall be able to give an account of this concourse.
044	ACT	019	041	And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.
044	ACT	020	001	And after the tumult had ceased, Paul called to him the disciples, and having embraced them departed to go into Macedonia.
044	ACT	020	002	And when he had gone through those regions, and had given them much exhortation, he came into Greece.
044	ACT	020	003	And when he had stayed three months, a plot having been laid for him by the Jews as he was about to sail for Syria, he resolved to return through Macedonia.
044	ACT	020	004	And there accompanied him as far as Asia, Sopater, son of Pyrrhus, a Beroean; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus, and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.
044	ACT	020	005	These having gone forward waited for us at Troas.
044	ACT	020	006	But we set sail from Philippi, after the days of unleavened bread, and came to them at Troas in five days, where we abode seven days.
044	ACT	020	007	And on the first day of the week, when we had assembled to break bread, Paul discoursed to them, being about to depart on the morrow, and continued the discourse until midnight.
044	ACT	020	008	And there were many lamps in the upper room where we had assembled.
044	ACT	020	009	And there sat on the window a certain young man named Eutychus, having fallen into a deep sleep; and as Paul was discoursing at great length, he sank down with sleep, and fell from thee third story, and was taken up dead.
044	ACT	020	010	But Paul went down and fell on him, and having embraced him, said, Make no lamentations; for his life is in him.
044	ACT	020	011	And having gone up again, and broken the bread and eaten, he talked a long while even till break of day, and so departed.
044	ACT	020	012	And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little comforted.
044	ACT	020	013	We however, going forward to the ship, put to sea for Assos, intending to take in Paul from that place; for so he had appointed, intending himself to go on foot.
044	ACT	020	014	And when he met us at Assos, we took him on board, and came to Mitylene;
044	ACT	020	015	and sailing thence, we came the following day over against Chios. And the next day we arrived at Samos; and having tarried at Trogyllium, we came the next day to Miletus.
044	ACT	020	016	For Paul had determined to sail past Ephesus, that he might not be detained in Asia; for he was hastening, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost.
044	ACT	020	017	And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church.
044	ACT	020	018	And when they had come to him, he said to them: Ye yourselves know, from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been with you the whole time,
044	ACT	020	019	serving the Lord with all humility, and with tears, and trials which befell me by the plots of the Jews;
044	ACT	020	020	how I kept back nothing that was profitable, but have made it known to you, and have taught you publicly, and from house to house;
044	ACT	020	021	testifying to both Jews and Greeks repentance toward God, and faith in our Lord Jesus.
044	ACT	020	022	And now behold, I go, bound in my spirit, to Jerusalem, not knowing the things that will befall me there;
044	ACT	020	023	save that the Holy Spirit witnesseth to me in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions await me.
044	ACT	020	024	But I count life of no value to me, so that I may finish my course, and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify the glad tidings of the grace of God.
044	ACT	020	025	And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I went about preaching the kingdom, will see my face no more.
044	ACT	020	026	Wherefore I testify to you this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men;
044	ACT	020	027	for I have not shunned to declare to you the whole counsel of God.
044	ACT	020	028	Take heed therefore to yourselves, and to all the flock over which the Holy Spirit made you overseers, to feed the church of the Lord, which he purchased with his own blood.
044	ACT	020	029	For I know this, that after my departure grievous wolves will enter in among you, not sparing the flock.
044	ACT	020	030	And from among yourselves will men arise speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after them.
044	ACT	020	031	Therefore be watchful, and remember that for the space of three years, night and day, I ceased not to warn every one with tears.
044	ACT	020	032	And now I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, who is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all the sanctified.
044	ACT	020	033	I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel.
044	ACT	020	034	Ye yourselves know, that these hands ministered to my necessities, and to those that were with me.
044	ACT	020	035	In all ways I showed you that so laboring ye ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that he himself said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.
044	ACT	020	036	And having thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with them all.
044	ACT	020	037	And they all wept sorely, and fell on Paul's neck, and kissed him;
044	ACT	020	038	sorrowing most of all for the word which he had spoken, that they were to see his face no more. And they accompanied him to the ship.
044	ACT	021	001	And it came to pass, after we had torn ourselves from them, and had put to sea, that we came with a straight course to Cos, and the day following to Rhodes, and from thence to Patara.
044	ACT	021	002	And finding a ship crossing over to Phenicia, we went aboard, and put to sea.
044	ACT	021	003	And having come in sight of Cyprus, we passed it on the left, and sailed to Syria, and landed at Tyre; for there the ship was to unlade her cargo.
044	ACT	021	004	And having found out the disciples, we remained there seven days; and they told Paul, through the Spirit, not to go up to Jerusalem.
044	ACT	021	005	And when we had completed the days, we departed, and went our way, they all accompanying us, with wives and children, till we were out of the city; and having kneeled down on the shore and prayed,
044	ACT	021	006	we took leave of each other, and went on board the ship; and they returned home.
044	ACT	021	007	But we, finishing our voyage, came down from Tyre to Ptolemais; and having embraced the brethren, remained with them one day.
044	ACT	021	008	And on the morrow we departed, and came to Caesarea; and entering the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, we stayed with him.
044	ACT	021	009	And this man had four daughters, virgins, who prophesied.
044	ACT	021	010	And while we were staying some days longer, there came down from Judaea a certain prophet, named Agabus;
044	ACT	021	011	and coming to us, he took off Paul's girdle, and bound his own feet and hands, and said, Thus saith the Holy Spirit: So will the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle, and will deliver him into the hands of the gentiles.
044	ACT	021	012	But when we heard this, both we, and they of that place, besought him not to go to Jerusalem.
044	ACT	021	013	Then answered Paul, What mean ye that ye weep, and break my heart? For I am ready not only to be bound, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.
044	ACT	021	014	And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased; saying, The Lord's will be done.
044	ACT	021	015	And after those days we got ready our baggage, and went up to Jerusalem.
044	ACT	021	016	There went with us also some of the disciples of Caesarea, bringing us to one Mnason, a Cyprian, an old disciple, with whom we should lodge.
044	ACT	021	017	And when we arrived at Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly.
044	ACT	021	018	And the day following Paul went in with us to James; and all the elders were present.
044	ACT	021	019	And having embraced them, he recounted particularly what things God had wrought among the gentiles through his ministry.
044	ACT	021	020	And they on hearing it glorified God; and said to him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousands of believers there are among the Jews, and they are all zealots for the Law.
044	ACT	021	021	But they have been informed concerning thee, that thou teachest all the Jews who are among the gentiles to forsake Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children, nor to walk after the customs.
044	ACT	021	022	What then is to be done? The multitude will necessarily come together; for they will hear that thou hast come.
044	ACT	021	023	Do this therefore that we advise thee. We have four men who have a vow on them.
044	ACT	021	024	These take, and purify thyself with them, and pay the expenses for them, that they may shave their heads; and all will know that those things of which they have been informed concerning thee are nothing, but that thou thyself also walkest in observance of the Law.
044	ACT	021	025	But concerning the gentile believers, we have written to them and decided that they should observe no such thing, save only to abstain from things offered to idols, and from blood, and from what hath been strangled, and from fornication.
044	ACT	021	026	Then Paul took the men, and the next day having purified himself with them, entered the temple, announcing the completion of the days of the purification, until the offering was made for every one of them.
044	ACT	021	027	And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews from Asia, having seen him in the temple, stirred up the whole multitude, and laid hands on him,
044	ACT	021	028	crying out, Men of Israel, help! This is the man that teacheth every one everywhere against the people, and the Law, and this place; and besides he even brought Greeks into the temple, and hath polluted this holy place.
044	ACT	021	029	For they had before seen with him in the city Trophimus, the Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.
044	ACT	021	030	And the whole city was in motion, and the people ran together; and they laid hold of Paul and dragged him out of the temple; and forthwith the doors were shut.
044	ACT	021	031	And while they were endeavoring to kill him, tidings came up to the chief captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar;
044	ACT	021	032	who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down to them. And seeing the chief captain and the soldiers, they left off beating Paul.
044	ACT	021	033	Then the chief captain came near and laid hold of him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains; and inquired who he was, and what he had done.
044	ACT	021	034	And some cried one thing, and some another, among the multitude. And not being able to gain certain knowledge on account of the uproar, he ordered him to be carried into the castle.
044	ACT	021	035	And when he reached the stairs, he was obliged to be borne by the soldiers, on account of the violence of the crowd;
044	ACT	021	036	for the multitude of the people were following, crying out, Away with him!
044	ACT	021	037	And as he was about to be led into the castle, Paul saith to the chief captain, May I speak to thee? And he said, Canst thou speak Greek?
044	ACT	021	038	Art thou not then the Egyptian, who before these days made an insurrection, and led out into the wilderness those four thousand men of the assassins?
044	ACT	021	039	But Paul said, I am a Jew of Tarsus, a citizen of no mean city of Cilicia; and I beseech thee, suffer me to speak to the people.
044	ACT	021	040	And when he had given him leave, Paul stood on the stairs, and beckoned with his hand to the people, and there was a great silence; and he spoke to them in the Hebrew tongue, saying,
044	ACT	022	001	Brethren and fathers, hear my defence, which I now make to you.
044	ACT	022	002	And on hearing him speak to them in the Hebrew tongue, they kept the more silence. And he saith:
044	ACT	022	003	I am indeed a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, hut brought up in this city, taught at the feet of Gamaliel in the strictness of the Law of our fathers, being zealous for God, as ye all are this day.
044	ACT	022	004	And I persecuted this way [[of belief]] even to death, binding and putting into prisons both men and women,
044	ACT	022	005	as also the high-priest beareth me witness, and all the elderhood; from whom I received letters to the brethren, and was on my way to Damascus to bring those also that were there, bound, to Jerusalem, that they might be punished.
044	ACT	022	006	But it came to pass, as I was on my way, and approaching Damascus, that about noon there suddenly shone around me a great light from heaven;
044	ACT	022	007	and I fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to me, Saul, Saul, why dost thou persecute me?
044	ACT	022	008	And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said to me, I am Jesus the Nazarene, whom thou persecutest.
044	ACT	022	009	And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid; but the voice of him that spoke to me they did not hear.
044	ACT	022	010	And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said to me, Arise, and go into Damascus; and there thou wilt be told of all which it hath been appointed thee to do.
044	ACT	022	011	And as I could not see by reason of the brightness of that light, I was led by the hand of those that were with me, and came into Damascus.
044	ACT	022	012	But one Ananias, a devout man according to the Law, well spoken of by all the Jews who dwelt there,
044	ACT	022	013	came to me, and standing over me said, Brother Saul, receive sight. And I immediately looked up upon him.
044	ACT	022	014	And he said, The God of our fathers chose thee to know his will, and to see the Righteous One, and to hear a voice from his mouth;
044	ACT	022	015	for thou shalt be a witness for him to all men of what thou hast seen and heard.
044	ACT	022	016	And now why dost thou delay? Arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on his name.
044	ACT	022	017	And it came to pass after my return to Jerusalem, while I was praying in the temple, that I fell into a trance,
044	ACT	022	018	and saw him saying to me, Make haste, and go quickly out of Jerusalem; for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me.
044	ACT	022	019	And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned, and beat in every synagogue, those that believed in thee;
044	ACT	022	020	and when the blood of Stephen, thy witness, was shed, I myself was standing by and consenting, and keeping the garments of those who slew him.
044	ACT	022	021	And he said to me, Depart; for I will send thee far hence to the gentiles.
044	ACT	022	022	And they listened to him as far as this word, and then lifted up their voices, and said, Away with such a fellow from the earth! for it was not fit that he should live.
044	ACT	022	023	And as they were crying out, and shaking their garments, and throwing dust into the air,
044	ACT	022	024	the chief captain ordered him to be brought into the castle, and bade that he should be examined by scourging; that he might ascertain for what cause they were thus crying out against him.
044	ACT	022	025	But when they had stretched him out with the cords, Paul said to the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?
044	ACT	022	026	When the centurion heard this, he went and told the chief captain, saying, What art thou about to do? For this man is a Roman.
044	ACT	022	027	Then the chief captain came and said to him, Tell me, art thou a Roman? He said, Yes.
044	ACT	022	028	The chief captain answered, For a great sum I obtained this citizenship. And Paul said, But I was born a Roman.
044	ACT	022	029	They therefore who were about to examine him left him immediately. And the chief captain also was alarmed when he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.
044	ACT	022	030	On the morrow, wishing to have certain knowledge why he was accused by the Jews, he released him, and ordered the chief priests and all the council to assemble; and bringing Paul down, he set him before them.
044	ACT	023	001	And Paul looking earnestly upon the council, said: Brethren! I have ordered my life in all good conscience before God to this day.
044	ACT	023	002	And the high-priest, Ananias, commanded those who stood by him to smite him on the mouth.
044	ACT	023	003	Then Paul said to him, God will smite thee, thou whited wall! Art thou then sitting to judge me according to the law, and dost thou command me to be smitten contrary to the law?
044	ACT	023	004	And they that stood by said, Dost thou revile God's high-priest?
044	ACT	023	005	Then said Paul, I knew not, brethren, that he was high-priest; for it is written, “Thou shalt not speak evil of a ruler of thy people.”
044	ACT	023	006	But Paul, perceiving one part to be Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, cried aloud in the council, Brethren! I am a Pharisee, the son of Pharisees; for the hope of the resurrection of the dead I am now tried.
044	ACT	023	007	And when he had said this, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees; and the multitude was divided.
044	ACT	023	008	For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, and no angel or spirit; but the Pharisees affirm both.
044	ACT	023	009	And there arose a great clamor; and scribes of the party of the Pharisees arose, and contended, saying, We find nothing amiss in this man; but if a spirit hath spoken to him or an angel—
044	ACT	023	010	And a great dissension arising, the chief captain, fearing that Paul would be torn in pieces by them, ordered the soldiers to go down and take him by force from among them, and bring him into the castle.
044	ACT	023	011	And the night following, the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good courage; for as thou hast borne witness concerning me in Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome.
044	ACT	023	012	And when it was day, the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.
044	ACT	023	013	And there were more than forty who took this oath together.
044	ACT	023	014	And they came to the chief priests and the elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse, to taste nothing until we have killed Paul.
044	ACT	023	015	Now therefore do ye with the council give notice to the chief captain, that he bring him down to you, as though ye were about to examine his case more thoroughly; and we are ready to kill him before he cometh near you.
044	ACT	023	016	But Paul's sister's son hearing of the plot went, and entering the castle, told Paul.
044	ACT	023	017	Then Paul called one of the centurions to him, and said, Take this young man to the chief captain; for he hath something to tell him.
044	ACT	023	018	So he took him and brought him to the chief captain, and said, Paul the prisoner called me to him, and asked me to bring this young man to thee, as he hath something to say to thee.
044	ACT	023	019	Then the chief captain took him by the hand and went aside privately, and asked him, What is it that thou hast to tell me?
044	ACT	023	020	And he said, The Jews have agreed to ask thee to bring down Paul tomorrow into the council, as though thou wert about to inquire more thoroughly concerning him.
044	ACT	023	021	But do not thou yield to them; for there lie in wait for him more than forty men of them, who have bound themselves with an oath neither to eat nor drink till they have killed him; and they are now ready, looking for the promise from thee.
044	ACT	023	022	The chief captain then dismissed the young man with the charge, Tell no one that thou hast disclosed these things to me.
044	ACT	023	023	And he called to him two of the centurions, saying, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, and seventy horsemen, and two hundred spearmen, at the third hour of the night;
044	ACT	023	024	and provide beasts, whereon they may set Paul, and carry him safe to Felix the governor.
044	ACT	023	025	And he wrote a letter after this manner:
044	ACT	023	026	Claudius Lysias to the moss excellent governor Felix, greeting.
044	ACT	023	027	This man was taken by the Jews, and was about to be killed by them; but I came upon them with the soldiery, and rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman.
044	ACT	023	028	And wishing to know the crime of which they accused him, I brought him down to their council;
044	ACT	023	029	but I found him to be accused only on account of questions of their law, and to have nothing laid to his charge deserving death or bonds.
044	ACT	023	030	And having been informed of a plot against the man, I sent him at once to thee, and directed his accusers also to bring their charges against him before thee.
044	ACT	023	031	Then the soldiers, as was commanded them, took Paul, and brought him by night to Antipatris.
044	ACT	023	032	But on the morrow they left the horsemen to go on with him, and returned to the castle.
044	ACT	023	033	And they, when they had come to Caesarea, and delivered the letter to the governor, presented Paul also before him.
044	ACT	023	034	And having read the letter, he asked of what province he was; and when he understood that he was of Cilicia,
044	ACT	023	035	he said, I will hear thee fully, when thy accusers also have arrived. And he ordered him to be kept in Herod's palace.
044	ACT	024	001	And after five days Ananias, the high-priest, came down with the elders and a certain orator named Tertullus; and they brought a complaint before the governor against Paul.
044	ACT	024	002	And when he had been called, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy much peace, and that improvements are in every way and everywhere taking place in this nation through thy foresight,
044	ACT	024	003	we accept it, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness.
044	ACT	024	004	But not to detain thee too long, I pray thee to hear us, in thy clemency, a few words.
044	ACT	024	005	For we have found this man to be a pest, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes;
044	ACT	024	006	who also attempted to profane the temple, and we apprehended him;
044	ACT	024	008	and from him thou canst thyself ascertain by examination all these things of which we accuse him.
044	ACT	024	009	And the Jews also joined in the charges against him, affirming that these things were so.
044	ACT	024	010	Then Paul, after the governor had beckoned to him to speak, answered, Since I know that thou hast been for many years a judge for this nation, I answer for myself cheerfully;
044	ACT	024	011	for it is in thy power to ascertain that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem to worship.
044	ACT	024	012	And neither in the temple did they find me disputing with any one, or stirring up a tumult of the people, nor in the synagogues, nor in the city;
044	ACT	024	013	nor can they prove the things of which they now accuse me.
044	ACT	024	014	But this I acknowledge to thee, that according to the way [[of belief]] which they call a sect, so do I worship the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the Law and by the Prophets;
044	ACT	024	015	having a hope in God, which they themselves also entertain, that there will be a resurrection both of the righteous and the unrighteous.
044	ACT	024	016	On this ground do I also myself strive to have always a conscience void of offence toward God and toward men.
044	ACT	024	017	And after some years I came to bring alms to my nation, and to make offerings;
044	ACT	024	018	in doing which they found me purified in the temple, not with a crowd nor with tumult; but certain Jews from Asia [[caused it]],
044	ACT	024	019	who ought to be here before thee, and make their charge, if they had aught against me.
044	ACT	024	020	Or, let these men themselves say what wrongdoing they found in me when I stood before the council,
044	ACT	024	021	except in relation to this one expression, which I uttered aloud while standing among them: Concerning the resurrection of the dead I am tried before you this day.
044	ACT	024	022	But Felix, having an accurate knowledge of the matters relating to this way [[of belief]], put them off, and said, When Lysias the chief captain cometh down, I will thoroughly examine your case.
044	ACT	024	023	He also gave orders to the centurion to guard him, and let him have indulgence, and not to forbid any of his friends to do him service.
044	ACT	024	024	And after some days, Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was a Jewess, and sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.
044	ACT	024	025	And as he discoursed of righteousness, and temperance, and the judgment to come, Felix became alarmed, and answered, Go thy way for the present; and when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee.
044	ACT	024	026	He hoped also that money would be given him by Paul; on which account he sent for him the oftener, and conversed with him.
044	ACT	024	027	But after two years Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus; and Felix, wishing to gain favor with the Jews, left Paul bound.
044	ACT	025	001	Festus therefore having come into the province, after three days went up from Caesarea to Jerusalem.
044	ACT	025	002	And the chief priests and the leaders of the Jews brought a complaint before him against Paul, and besought him,
044	ACT	025	003	asking for themselves a favor against him, that he would send for him to Jerusalem, intending to place men in wait to kill him on the road.
044	ACT	025	004	But Festus answered that Paul was in custody at Caesarea, and that he himself was going thither shortly.
044	ACT	025	005	Let those therefore, said he, who have authority among you, go down with me and accuse this man, if he is guilty of anything.
044	ACT	025	006	And having tarried among them not more than eight or ten days, he went down to Caesarea; and on the morrow, sitting on the judgment-seat, ordered Paul to be brought.
044	ACT	025	007	And when he had come, the Jews who came down from Jerusalem stood around, bringing many and heavy charges which they could not prove;
044	ACT	025	008	while Paul said in his defence, Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar have I committed any offence.
044	ACT	025	009	But Festus, wishing to gain favor with the Jews, answered Paul and said, Art thou willing to go up to Jerusalem, and there be tried on these charges before me?
044	ACT	025	010	But Paul said, I stand at the judgment-seat of Caesar, where I ought to be tried. To the Jews I have done no wrong, as thou also very well knowest.
044	ACT	025	011	If indeed I am an offender, and have done anything deserving death, I refuse not to die; but if there be nothing in the charges which they bring against me, no man can give me up to them. I appeal to Caesar.
044	ACT	025	012	Then Festus having conferred with the council, answered, Thou hast appealed to Caesar; to Caesar shalt thou go.
044	ACT	025	013	And after some days Agrippa the king and Bernice came to Caesarea to greet Festus.
044	ACT	025	014	And while they were making a stay of some days there, Festus laid the case of Paul before the king, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix,
044	ACT	025	015	against whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews brought a complaint, asking for judgment against him.
044	ACT	025	016	To whom I answered, It is not the custom of the Romans to give up any man on a charge, before the accused hath the accusers face to face, and hath opportunity to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him.
044	ACT	025	017	When therefore they had come together here, without any delay I sat on the judgment-seat on the day after, and ordered the man to be brought forward.
044	ACT	025	018	And his accusers standing around him brought no accusation of such things as I had conjectured,
044	ACT	025	019	but had against him certain questions of their own religion, and of one Jesus that was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.
044	ACT	025	020	And I being at a loss about such questions, asked him if he was willing to go to Jerusalem and there be put on trial for these matters.
044	ACT	025	021	But Paul having appealed to be kept in custody for the judgment of Augustus, I ordered him to be kept till I should send him up to Caesar.
044	ACT	025	022	Then Agrippa said to Festus, I should like to hear the man myself. Tomorrow, said he, thou shalt hear him.
044	ACT	025	023	Accordingly on the morrow Agrippa and Bernice came with great pomp, and entered into the place of hearing, with the chief captains and principal men of the city, and at the order of Festus Paul was brought forward.
044	ACT	025	024	And Festus said: King Agrippa, and all men who are here present with us! Ye see this man about whom the whole multitude of the Jews applied to me both at Jerusalem and here, crying out that he ought no longer to live.
044	ACT	025	025	But having found that he had done nothing deserving death, and he himself having appealed to Augustus, I determined to send him;
044	ACT	025	026	and as I have nothing certain to write about him to the emperor, I have brought him forward before you, and specially before thee, king Agrippa, that when the examination hath been made, I may have something to write.
044	ACT	025	027	For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner and not signify the charges against him;
044	ACT	026	001	And Agrippa said to Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for thyself. Then Paul stretched forth his hand and made his defence:
044	ACT	026	002	I think myself happy, king Agrippa, that I am to make my defence this day before thee concerning all things of which I am accused by the Jews;
044	ACT	026	003	especially as thou art acquainted with all the customs and questions among the Jews. Wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.
044	ACT	026	004	My manner of life, then, from my youth, which was from the beginning among my own nation and at Jerusalem, all Jews know:
044	ACT	026	005	and they know, if they are willing to testify, that from the first, according to the strictest sect of our religion, I lived a Pharisee.
044	ACT	026	006	And now I stand on trial for the hope of the promise made by God to the fathers,
044	ACT	026	007	which our twelve tribes, earnestly serving God day and night, hope to obtain; concerning which hope, O king, I am accused by Jews.
044	ACT	026	008	Why is it judged incredible with you if God raiseth the dead?
044	ACT	026	009	I indeed thought with myself that I ought to do many things in opposition to the name of Jesus the Nazarene.
044	ACT	026	010	Which I also did in Jerusalem; and many of the saints did I myself shut up in prisons, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against them.
044	ACT	026	011	And I punished them often in all the synagogues, and compelled them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I pursued them even to foreign cities.
044	ACT	026	012	And as I was going to Damascus on this business, with authority and a commission from the chief priests,
044	ACT	026	013	at mid-day, on the road, O king, I saw a light from heaven above the brightness of the sun, shining around me and those who were journeying with me.
044	ACT	026	014	And when we had all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking to me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? It is hard for thee to kick against the goads.
044	ACT	026	015	And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus, whom thou persecutest.
044	ACT	026	016	But arise and stand upon thy feet; for I have appeared to thee for this purpose, to prepare thee as a minister and a witness both of the things which thou sawest, and of those on account of which I will appear to thee;
044	ACT	026	017	delivering thee from the people, and from the gentiles, to whom I send thee,
044	ACT	026	018	to open their eyes that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and an inheritance among the sanctified, by faith in me.
044	ACT	026	019	Wherefore, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision;
044	ACT	026	020	but first to those in Damascus, and Jerusalem, and to all the country of Judaea, and then to the gentiles, I proclaimed that they should repent and turn to God, doing works worthy of repentance.
044	ACT	026	021	For these causes the Jews seized me in the temple, and attempted to kill me.
044	ACT	026	022	Having, however, obtained help from God, I continue to this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying nothing except those things which the Prophets and Moses said were to come to pass;
044	ACT	026	023	that the Christ should suffer, and that, as first of those raised from the dead, he was to proclaim light both to the people and to the gentiles.
044	ACT	026	024	And as he was thus speaking in his defence, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning is making thee mad.
044	ACT	026	025	But he saith, I am not mad, most noble Festus, but utter words of truth and soberness.
044	ACT	026	026	For the king knoweth about these things well; to whom also I speak boldly; for I am persuaded that none of these things is hidden from him: for this was not done in a corner.
044	ACT	026	027	King Agrippa, believest thou the Prophets? I know that thou believest.
044	ACT	026	028	Then Agrippa said to Paul, With little effort thou thinkest to persuade me to become a Christian.
044	ACT	026	029	And Paul said, I would to God, that with little effort or with great, not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, might be made such as I am, except these bonds.
044	ACT	026	030	And the king rose up and the governor and Bernice, and those who sat with them;
044	ACT	026	031	and going aside they talked with each other, saying, This man is doing nothing deserving death, or bonds.
044	ACT	026	032	And Agrippa said to Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed to Caesar.
044	ACT	027	001	And when it was determined that we should sail for Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners to a centurion named Julius, of the Augustan band.
044	ACT	027	002	And going on board a ship of Adramyttium, about to sail along the coasts of Asia, we put to sea; Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.
044	ACT	027	003	And the next day we landed at Sidon; and Julius treated Paul kindly, and gave him leave to go to his friends, and receive their care.
044	ACT	027	004	And thence putting to sea, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.
044	ACT	027	005	And having sailed over the sea along Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia.
044	ACT	027	006	And there the centurion, finding a ship of Alexandria about to sail for Italy, put us on board of it.
044	ACT	027	007	And sailing slowly some days, and having with difficulty arrived over against Cnidus, the wind not permitting us to put in, we sailed under Crete, over against Salmone;
044	ACT	027	008	and coasting along it with difficulty we came to a place called Fair Havens, near which was the city Lasea.
044	ACT	027	009	And much time having been spent, and the voyage being now dangerous, because the Fast had already gone by, Paul advised them,
044	ACT	027	010	saying, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with injury and much loss, not only of the lading and the ship, but also of our lives.
044	ACT	027	011	But the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship more than what was spoken by Paul.
044	ACT	027	012	And as the harbor was not well situated for wintering, the greater part advised to sail thence also, if by any means they might reach Phoenix, a harbor of Crete, looking toward the southwest and northwest, and there winter.
044	ACT	027	013	And when a south wind blew gently, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, they weighed anchor, and coasted along close by Crete.
044	ACT	027	014	But not long after, there rushed against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon.
044	ACT	027	015	And the ship being caught, and unable to face the wind, we gave up to it, and were driven along.
044	ACT	027	016	And running under a certain small island called Clauda, we were hardly able to get possession of the boat;
044	ACT	027	017	which when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship; and fearing lest they should run into the Syrtis, they lowered the sail and so were driven.
044	ACT	027	018	And as we were violently tempest-tossed, the next day they began to lighten the vessel;
044	ACT	027	019	and the third day we cast out with our own hands the movables of the ship.
044	ACT	027	020	And as neither sun nor stars had appeared for many days, and no small tempest lay on us, thenceforward all hope that we should be saved was taken away.
044	ACT	027	021	And after there had been much abstinence from food, Paul stood up in the midst of them and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened to me, and not have put to sea from Crete, nod thus brought upon yourselves this injury and loss.
044	ACT	027	022	And now I exhort you to be of good cheer; for there will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship.
044	ACT	027	023	For there stood by me this night an angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve,
044	ACT	027	024	saying, Fear not, Paul! Thou must stand before Caesar; and lo, God hath given thee all those that sail with thee.
044	ACT	027	025	Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer; for I believe God, that it will be just as it hath been told me.
044	ACT	027	026	But we must be cast upon some island.
044	ACT	027	027	And when the fourteenth night had come on, as we were driven onward in the Adriatic sea, about midnight the sailors suspected that they were near some country;
044	ACT	027	028	and sounding, they found twenty fathoms; and having gone a little further and sounded again, they found fifteen fathoms;
044	ACT	027	029	then fearing lest we should fall upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for day.
044	ACT	027	030	And as the sailors were seeking means to escape from the ship, when they had lowered the boat into the sea, under the pretence that they were about to carry out anchors from the foreship,
044	ACT	027	031	Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, If these men do not stay in the ship, ye cannot be saved.
044	ACT	027	032	Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let it fall off.
044	ACT	027	033	And while the day was coming on, Paul exhorted them all to take food; saying, This is the fourteenth day that ye have waited, and continued fasting, having taken nothing.
044	ACT	027	034	Wherefore I exhort you to take food; for this is for your safety; for there shall not a hair be lost from the head of one of you.
044	ACT	027	035	And having thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in presence of them all, and having broken it, he began to eat.
044	ACT	027	036	Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took food.
044	ACT	027	037	And there were of us in the ship in all two hundred and seventy-six souls.
044	ACT	027	038	And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, casting out the grain into the sea.
044	ACT	027	039	And when it was day, they did not know the land; but they observed a certain creek having a beach, into which they determined, if possible, to run the ship.
044	ACT	027	040	And cutting away the anchors, they left them in the sea, and at the same time unfastening the rudder-bands, and hoisting the foresail to the wind, they made toward the beach.
044	ACT	027	041	And falling into a place having the sea on both sides, they ran the ship aground; and the prow stuck fast, and remained immovable, but the stern was breaking to pieces with the violence [[of the waves]].
044	ACT	027	042	And on the part of the soldiers there was a plan to kill the prisoners, lest any one should swim out and escape.
044	ACT	027	043	But the centurion, wishing to save Paul, kept them from their purpose, and ordered those who could swim to cast themselves first into the sea, and get to land,
044	ACT	027	044	and the rest, some on boards, and others on something from the ship. And in this way it came to pass, that they all escaped safe to land.
044	ACT	028	001	And having escaped, we learned that the island was called Melita.
044	ACT	028	002	And the barbarians showed us no little kindness; for they kindled a fire, and received us all, because of the rain which had come on, and because of the cold.
044	ACT	028	003	And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid it on the fire, there came forth a viper by reason of the heat, and fastened on his hand.
044	ACT	028	004	And when the barbarians saw the animal hanging from his hand, they said to one another, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom though he hath escaped the sea, Justice hath not permitted to live.
044	ACT	028	005	He, however, shaking off the animal into the fire suffered no harm.
044	ACT	028	006	But they were looking for his becoming swollen, or suddenly falling down dead. But after looking a great while, and seeing no harm come to him they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.
044	ACT	028	007	And in the neighborhood of that place were lands be longing to the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius; who welcomed us, and entertained us kindly three days.
044	ACT	028	008	And it happened that the father of Publius was lying sick with a fever and dysentery; to whom Paul went in, and, when he had prayed, laid his hands on him, and healed him.
044	ACT	028	009	And when this was done, the others also who had diseases in the island came, and were healed;
044	ACT	028	010	who also honored us with many honors, and when we put to sea, loaded us with such things as were necessary.
044	ACT	028	011	And after three months we put to sea in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the island, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.
044	ACT	028	012	And landing at Syracuse, we stayed there three days;
044	ACT	028	013	and from thence we made a circuit, and came to Rhegium; and after one day a south wind arose, and we came on the second day to Puteoli,
044	ACT	028	014	where we found brethren, and were entreated to remain with them seven days; and so we went toward Rome.
044	ACT	028	015	And from thence, the brethren having heard of us came to meet us as far as Appii Forum, and the Three Taverns; at the sight of whom Paul thanked God and took courage.
044	ACT	028	016	And when we had come to Rome, Paul was permitted to dwell by himself, with the soldier that guarded him.
044	ACT	028	017	And it came to pass that after three days he called together the chief men of the Jews, and when they had met he said to them, Brethren, I, though I had done nothing against the people, or the customs of our fathers, was delivered up a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans;
044	ACT	028	018	who, when they had examined me, wished to release me, because I had done nothing deserving death.
044	ACT	028	019	But when the Jews spoke against it, I was constrained to appeal to Caesar; not that I had any charge to bring against my nation.
044	ACT	028	020	For this reason therefore I have called for you, to see you and speak to you; for it is on account of the hope of Israel that I am bound with this chain.
044	ACT	028	021	And they said to him, We neither received letters from Judea concerning thee, nor did any one of the brethren that came report or speak any evil of thee.
044	ACT	028	022	But we think it proper to hear from thee what thou thinkest; for with regard to this sect, we know that it is everywhere spoken against.
044	ACT	028	023	And when they had appointed him a day, many came to him at his lodging; to whom he expounded, and earnestly testified, the kingdom of God, endeavoring to persuade them concerning Jesus both from the Law of Moses, and from the Prophets, from morning till evening.
044	ACT	028	024	And some believed the things spoken, and some believed not.
044	ACT	028	025	So, disagreeing with one another, they took their departure, after Paul had spoken one word: Well did the Holy Spirit speak through Isaiah the prophet to your fathers,
044	ACT	028	026	saying, “Go to this people, and say, 'Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see and not perceive.
044	ACT	028	027	For the heart of this people hath become gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart and turn from their ways, and I should heal them.'”
044	ACT	028	028	Be it therefore known to you, that to the gentiles this salvation of God hath been sent; they, moreover, will hear.
044	ACT	028	030	And he abode two whole years in his own hired house and gladly received all that came in to him,
044	ACT	028	031	proclaiming the kingdom of God, and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, without hindrance from any one.

045	ROM	001	009	For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, how constantly I make mention of you, always in my prayers
045	ROM	001	010	supplicating that, if it be possible, I may at last through the will of God be favored with an opportunity of coming to you.
045	ROM	001	011	For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift, which may be for your confirmation;
045	ROM	001	012	that is, that I may be edified among you, and you also, through each other's faith, both yours and mine.
045	ROM	001	013	But I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that I often purposed to come to you, though I have been hindered hitherto, that I might have some fruit of my labors among you also, as among the other gentiles.
045	ROM	001	014	I am debtor both to Greeks and barbarians, both to the wise and the unwise.
045	ROM	001	015	So, according to my ability, I am ready to preach the gospel to you also in Rome.
045	ROM	001	016	For I am not ashamed of the gospel; for to every believer, to the Jew first and also to the Greek, it is the power of God unto salvation.
045	ROM	001	017	For therein is revealed the righteousness which is of God from faith to faith; as it is written, “But the righteous shall live by faith.”
045	ROM	001	018	For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all impiety and unrighteousness of men, who keep down the truth in unrighteousness.
045	ROM	001	019	Because that which may be known of God is manifest within them; for God made it manifest to them.
045	ROM	001	020	For, ever since the creation of the world, his invisible attributes, even his eternal power and divinity, being perceived from his works, are clearly seen, so that they might be without excuse.
045	ROM	001	021	Because though they knew God, they did not glorify him as God, nor were they thankful to him; but became perverse in their reasonings, and their senseless minds were darkened;
045	ROM	001	022	professing to be wise, they became fools,
045	ROM	001	023	and for the glory of the incorruptible God they substituted images of corruptible man, and of birds and four-footed beasts and creeping things.
045	ROM	001	024	Wherefore God also gave them over in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, to debase their bodies with one another;
045	ROM	001	025	because they changed the true God for false gods, and adored and worshipped created things rather than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.
045	ROM	001	026	For this cause God gave them up to vile passions. For even their women indulged in unnatural lust,
045	ROM	001	027	and in like manner the men also, neglecting the natural use of the female, burned with lust for one another, men with men practising that which is shameful, and receiving in themselves the due recompense of their error.
045	ROM	001	028	And as they did not choose to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them up to a reprobate mind, to do things which are shameful;
045	ROM	001	029	being filled with all unrighteousness, malice, covetousness, wickedness; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malignity; backbiters,
045	ROM	001	030	slanderers, hated of God, insolent, proud, boasters, inventors of mischief, disobedient to parents,
045	ROM	001	031	senseless, faithless, without natural affection, without pity;
045	ROM	001	032	who, although knowing the ordinance of God, that they who practise such things deserve death, not only do them themselves, but approve of those who do them.
045	ROM	002	001	Wherefore thou art without excuse, O man that judgest, whoever thou art. For wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things.
045	ROM	002	002	But we know that the judgment of God is according to truth against those who practise such things.
045	ROM	002	003	And dost thou suppose, O man, who art judging those who do such things, and art thyself doing the same, that thou wilt escape the judgment of God?
045	ROM	002	004	Or dost thou despise the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering, not knowing that the goodness of God is leading thee to repentance?
045	ROM	002	005	But according to thy hardness and impenitent heart, thou art treasuring up for thyself wrath against the day of wrath and of the manifestation of the righteous judgment of God,
045	ROM	002	006	who will render to every one according to his works;
045	ROM	002	007	everlasting life to those who by patient continuance in well-doing seek for glory, and honor, and incorruption;
045	ROM	002	008	but to those who are contentious, and disobedient to the truth; but obey unrighteousness, there will be wrath and indignation.
045	ROM	002	009	Tribulation and distress will be upon every soul of man whose works are evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Greek;
045	ROM	002	010	but glory, honor, and peace, to every one whoso works are good, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.
045	ROM	002	011	For there is no respect of persons with God.
045	ROM	002	012	For as many as have sinned without a law, will also perish without a law; and as many as have sinned under a law, will be judged by a law,
045	ROM	002	013	for it is not the hearers of a law who are righteous before God, but the doers of a law will be accounted righteous; —
045	ROM	002	014	for when the gentiles, who have no law, do by nature what is required by the Law, these, having no law, are a law to themselves;
045	ROM	002	015	since they show that what the Law requireth is written in their hearts, their conscience bearing witness, and their thoughts in turn accusing or defending them; —
045	ROM	002	016	in the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ, according to the gospel which I have preached.
045	ROM	002	017	But if thou art called a Jew, and restest on the Law, and makest thy boast of God,
045	ROM	002	018	and knowest his will, and approvest the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the Law;
045	ROM	002	019	and art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light to those who are in darkness,
045	ROM	002	020	an instructor of those who lack wisdom, a teacher of babes, having the form of knowledge and of the truth in the Law, —
045	ROM	002	021	dost thou then who teachest another, not teach thyself? Thou who proclaimest that others should not steal, dost thou steal?
045	ROM	002	022	Dost thou who forbiddest to commit adultery, thyself commit adultery? Thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou rob temples?
045	ROM	002	023	Dost thou who boastest of the Law, dishonor God by breaking the Law?
045	ROM	002	024	For, as it is written, “the name of God is on your account blasphemed among the gentiles.”
045	ROM	002	025	For circumcision is indeed a benefit to thee, if thou keep the Law; but if thou art a breaker of the Law, thy circumcision hath become uncircumcision.
045	ROM	002	026	If then he who is uncircumcised keep the precepts of the Law, shall not he though uncircumcised be regarded as circumcised?
045	ROM	002	027	Yea, those who are by nature uncircumcised, if they perform the law, will judge thee, who having a written Law and circumcision, art a breaker of the Law.
045	ROM	002	028	For he is not a Jew, who is one outwardly, nor is that circumcision, which is outward, in the flesh;
045	ROM	002	029	but he is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is of the heart, spiritual, not literal, whose praise is not of men, but of God.
045	ROM	003	001	What then is the advantage of the Jew? or what the benefit of circumcision?
045	ROM	003	002	Great, every way. In the first place, because they were entrusted with the oracles of God.
045	ROM	003	003	For what? If some were unfaithful, shall their unfaithfulness make God unfaithful?
045	ROM	003	004	Far be it! yea, let God be true, and every man a liar; as it is written, “That thou mayst be justified in thy words, and mayst overcome when thou art arraigned.”
045	ROM	003	005	But if our unrighteousness serve to display the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who inflicteth punishment? (I am speaking as men do.)
045	ROM	003	006	Far be it! For then how shall God judge the world?
045	ROM	003	007	For if, through my being false, the truth of God hath been more abundantly manifested to his glory, why am I still judged as a sinner?
045	ROM	003	008	And why do you not say, as some slanderously charge us with saying, Let us do evil, that good may come? The condemnation of such men is just.
045	ROM	003	009	What then? Are we better than others? By no means! For we have already brought a charge both against Jews and Greeks, that they are all under sin.
045	ROM	003	010	As it is written: “There is none righteous, no, not one;
045	ROM	003	011	there is none that hath understanding, there is none that diligently seeketh God;
045	ROM	003	012	they have all turned aside from the right way, they have become worthless together; there is none that doeth good, not even one.
045	ROM	003	013	Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have practised deceit. The poison of asps is under their lips.
045	ROM	003	014	Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness.
045	ROM	003	015	Swift are their feet to shed blood;
045	ROM	003	016	destruction and misery are in their ways;
045	ROM	003	017	and the way of peace they know not.
045	ROM	003	018	There is no fear of God before their eyes.”
045	ROM	003	019	Now we know that whatever the Law saith, it saith to those who are under the Law; that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world become subject to condemnation before God.
045	ROM	003	020	Because by works of the Law no flesh shall be accepted as righteous: for by the Law is the knowledge of sin.
045	ROM	003	021	But now, apart from the Law, the righteousness which is of God, to which the Law and the Prophets bear testimony,
045	ROM	003	022	even the righteousness which is of God through faith in Jesus Christ, hath been made manifest to all and for all believers. For there is no distinction.
045	ROM	003	023	For all have sinned, and fail of obtaining the glory which cometh from God;
045	ROM	003	024	being accepted as righteous freely, by his grace, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus,
045	ROM	003	025	whom, in his blood, through faith, God hath set forth as a propitiatory sacrifice, in order to manifest his righteousness, on account of his passing by, in his forbearance, the sins committed in former times;
045	ROM	003	026	in order to manifest his righteousness at the present time, so that he may be righteous, and accept as righteous him who hath faith.
045	ROM	003	027	Where then is the boasting? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay; but by the law of faith.
045	ROM	003	028	We conclude therefore, that a man is accepted as righteous through faith, without the works of the Law.
045	ROM	003	029	Or is God [[the God]] of Jews alone? Is he not also the God of gentiles? Yea, of gentiles also.
045	ROM	003	030	Seeing there is but one God, who will accept the circumcised as righteous by faith, and the uncircumcised through faith.
045	ROM	003	031	Do we then make void the Law through faith? Far be it! On the contrary, we establish the Law.
045	ROM	004	001	What advantage then shall we say that Abraham our father had as to the flesh?
045	ROM	004	002	For if Abraham was accepted as righteous through works, he hath ground of boasting. But he hath no ground of boasting before God.
045	ROM	004	003	For what saith the scripture? “Abraham had faith in God, and it was accounted unto him as righteousness.”
045	ROM	004	004	Now to him that performeth works, the reward is not accounted a matter of grace, but of debt;
045	ROM	004	005	but to him who without performing works hath faith in him who accepteth as righteous one that hath been ungodly, his faith is accounted as righteousness;
045	ROM	004	006	as David also speaketh of the blessedness of the man whom God accepteth as righteous without works:
045	ROM	004	007	“Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.
045	ROM	004	008	Blessed is the man whom the Lord shall not charge with sin.”
045	ROM	004	009	Doth this blessedness belong to the circumcised alone, or to the uncircumcised also? For we are saying that Abraham's faith was accounted as righteousness.
045	ROM	004	010	How then was it so accounted? After his circumcision, or while he was uncircumcised? Not after he was circumcised, but while he was uncircumcised.
045	ROM	004	011	And he received the outward sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had while he was uncircumcised; that he might be the father of all the uncircumcised who have faith, so that righteousness might be put to their account also;
045	ROM	004	012	and that he might be the father of the circumcised, who are not circumcised merely, but who tread in the steps of that faith which our father Abraham had while yet uncircumcised.
045	ROM	004	013	For not through the Law was the promise made to Abraham or his offspring that he should be the heir of the world, but through the righteousness of faith.
045	ROM	004	014	For if they that are of the Law are heirs, then faith becometh a vain thing, and the promise is made of no effect.
045	ROM	004	015	For the Law is the cause of wrath; for where there is no law there is no transgression.
045	ROM	004	016	Therefore the inheritance was made to depend on faith, that it might be a matter of grace; that the promise might be sure to all the offspring, not to that only which is under the Law, but to that also which hath the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all
045	ROM	004	017	(as it is written, “I have made thee a father of many nations”) in the sight of that God whom he believed, who giveth life to the dead, and calleth the things that are not, as though they were.
045	ROM	004	018	For he had confident hope in that which was past hope, that he should become a father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, “Thus shall thy offspring be;”
045	ROM	004	019	and not being weak in faith, he regarded not his own body which had become dead, he being about a hundred years old, nor the deadness of Sarah's womb;
045	ROM	004	020	nor did he waver in respect to the promise of God through unbelief, but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;
045	ROM	004	021	being fully convinced, that what he hath promised, he is able also to perform.
045	ROM	004	022	And therefore it was accounted to him for righteousness.
045	ROM	004	023	And that it was so accounted was not written for his sake alone,
045	ROM	004	024	but for our sakes also, to whom it will be so accounted through our faith in him who raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead,
045	ROM	004	025	who was delivered up on account of our trespasses, and raised from the dead that we might be accepted as righteous.
045	ROM	005	001	Therefore being accepted as righteous through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ;
045	ROM	005	002	through whom also we have had admission into this grace in which we stand, and rejoice in the hope of the glory which God will confer.
045	ROM	005	003	And not only so, but we rejoice in afflictions also, knowing that affliction produceth endurance,
045	ROM	005	004	and endurance proof [[of faith]], and proof [[of faith giveth]] hope;
045	ROM	005	005	and hope will not disappoint us; because the love of God hath been shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which hath been given to us.
045	ROM	005	006	For while we were yet without strength, in due season Christ died for the ungodly.
045	ROM	005	007	Now hardly for a righteous man will one die; perhaps, however, for a benefactor one might even dare to die.
045	ROM	005	008	But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
045	ROM	005	009	Much more then, being now accepted as righteous through his blood, we shall be saved through him from the [[coming]] wrath.
045	ROM	005	010	For if while enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much more having been reconciled shall we be saved by his life;
045	ROM	005	011	and not this only, but also having joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation.
045	ROM	005	012	So then as through one man sin entered into the world, and through sin death, and thus [[death]] came through unto all men, because all sinned—
045	ROM	005	013	(for all the time before the Law sin was in the world; but sin is not set to one's account when there is no law.
045	ROM	005	014	Yet death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those who had not sinned in the manner in which Adam transgressed; who is a type of him who was to come.—
045	ROM	005	015	But the free gift was not as the transgression. For if through the offence of the one the many died, much more hath the grace of God, and the gift which is by the grace of the one man Jesus Christ, abounded to the many.
045	ROM	005	016	And the free gift is not like what happened through one man who sinned. For sentence of condemnation followed one offence; but the free gift is a justification after many offences.
045	ROM	005	017	For if by one trespass death reigned through the one man, much more will they who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man Jesus Christ.)—
045	ROM	005	018	As then through one trespass all men have come under condemnation, so through one act of righteousness all obtain the gift of righteousness unto life.
045	ROM	005	019	For as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners, so through the obedience of the one man will the many be made righteous.
045	ROM	005	020	Moreover the law came in in addition, that the trespass might abound; but where sin abounded, grace abounded much more;
045	ROM	005	021	that as sin reigned in death, so grace might reign through righteousness to everlasting life, through Jesus Christ our Lord.
045	ROM	006	001	What shall we say then? Let us continue in sin, that grace may abound still more?
045	ROM	006	002	God forbid! How shall we, who died to sin, live any longer in it?
045	ROM	006	003	Are ye ignorant, that all of us who were baptized into Jesus Christ, were baptized into his death?
045	ROM	006	004	We then by this baptism into his death were buried with him; that as Christ was raised from the dead by the glorious power of the Father, so we also might walk in newness of life.
045	ROM	006	005	For if we have been made completely like him in his death, we shall be made like him in his resurrection also;
045	ROM	006	006	knowing this, that our old man was crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that we might no longer be in slavery to sin;
045	ROM	006	007	for he that hath died hath been set free from sin.
045	ROM	006	008	And if we died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him;
045	ROM	006	009	since we know that Christ, having been raised from the dead, dieth no more; death hath dominion over him no longer.
045	ROM	006	010	For in that he died, he died to sin once for all; but in that he liveth, he liveth to God.
045	ROM	006	011	Thus do ye too consider yourselves as dead to sin, but alive to God, through Jesus Christ.
045	ROM	006	012	Let not then sin reign in your mortal body, bringing you into subjection to its lusts,
045	ROM	006	013	nor yield up your members to sin as instruments of unrighteousness; but yield up yourselves to God, as being alive from the dead, and your members to God as instruments of righteousness.
045	ROM	006	014	For sin shall not hold dominion over you; for ye are not under the Law, but under grace.
045	ROM	006	015	What then? Are we to sin, because we are not under the Law, but under grace? God forbid!
045	ROM	006	016	Know ye not, that whomever ye choose to obey as a master, his bondmen ye are, whether of sin whose fruit is death, or of obedience whose fruit is righteousness?
045	ROM	006	017	But thanks be to God that, though ye were the bondmen of sin, ye became obedient from the heart to that form of teaching which was delivered to you;
045	ROM	006	018	and being made free from sin, ye became the bondmen of righteousness.
045	ROM	006	019	I speak in a way common among men on account of the weakness of your flesh. For as ye once yielded your members as slaves to impurity and to iniquity, in order to commit iniquity, so now yield your members as bondmen to righteousness in order to become holy.
045	ROM	006	020	For when ye were the slaves of sin, ye were not the bondmen of righteousness.
045	ROM	006	021	What fruit then had ye at that time from those things of which ye are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death.
045	ROM	006	022	But now having been delivered from the slavery of sin, and having become the bondservants of God, ye have holiness as the fruit, and everlasting life as the end.
045	ROM	006	023	For the wages of sin is death; but the free gift of God is everlasting life, through Christ Jesus our Lord.
045	ROM	007	001	Know ye not, brethren, (for I am speaking to those who are acquainted with the Law, ) that the Law hath dominion over a man only as long as he liveth?
045	ROM	007	002	For the married woman is bound by law to her husband while he liveth; but if the husband die, she is released from the law which bound her to him.
045	ROM	007	003	So then, if while her husband is living she connect herself with another man, she will be called an adulteress; but if her husband die, she is no longer bound by that law, so that she will not be an adulteress, though she connect herself with another man.
045	ROM	007	004	So then, my brethren, ye also were slain to the Law through the body of Christ, that ye might be connected with another, even with him who was raised from the dead, that we might bear fruit to God.
045	ROM	007	005	For when we were in the flesh, the affections of sins, which were through the Law, were working in our members to bear fruit unto death.
045	ROM	007	006	But now we are delivered from the Law, having died to that by which we were bound, that we might serve in the new life of the Spirit, and not in the old way of the letter.
045	ROM	007	007	What then shall we say? Is the Law sin? God forbid! But I should not have known sin, except by the Law; for I should not have known sinful desire, unless the Law had said, “Thou shalt not covet.”
045	ROM	007	008	But sin, seizing the opportunity, wrought in me by means of the commandment all manner of sinful desire; for without the Law sin is dead.
045	ROM	007	009	And I, apart from the Law, was once alive; but when the commandment came, sin came to life again, and I died;
045	ROM	007	010	and the very commandment whose design was life, I found to issue in death.
045	ROM	007	011	For sin, seizing the opportunity, deceived me through the commandment, and through it slew me.
045	ROM	007	012	So that the Law is holy, and the commandment holy, and right, and good.
045	ROM	007	013	Did then that which is good become death to me? Far be it! but sin; that it might become manifest as sin, causing death to me by means of that which is good; that sin by means of the commandment might become exceedingly sinful.
045	ROM	007	014	For we know that the Law is spiritual; but I am unspiritual, a slave sold to sin.
045	ROM	007	015	For I know not what I do. For I do not what I would, but I do what I hate.
045	ROM	007	016	But if I do what I would not, I assent to the Law that it is good.
045	ROM	007	017	Now, however, it is no longer I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.
045	ROM	007	018	For I know that there dwelleth not in me, that is, in my flesh, any good thing; for to desire is present with me, but not to perform that which is good.
045	ROM	007	019	For the good that I would, I do not; but the evil which I would not, that I do.
045	ROM	007	020	But if I do what I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.
045	ROM	007	021	I find then that there is a law to me, that when I would do good, evil is present with me.
045	ROM	007	022	For I delight in the Law of God, as to the inward man;
045	ROM	007	023	but I perceive another law in my members warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.
045	ROM	007	024	Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from the body of this death?
045	ROM	007	025	Thanks be to God, [[who hath delivered me]] through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then, I, the same person, with the mind serve the law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin.
045	ROM	008	001	There is then now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.
045	ROM	008	002	For the law of the Spirit of life set me free in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and death.
045	ROM	008	003	For what the Law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God hath done, who on account of sin sent his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and passed sentence of condemnation on sin in the flesh;
045	ROM	008	004	so that what is required by the Law might be accomplished in us, who walk not according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.
045	ROM	008	005	For they who are according to the flesh have their mind on the things of the flesh; but they who are according to the Spirit, on the things of the Spirit.
045	ROM	008	006	For the mind of the flesh is death; but the mind of the Spirit life and peace.
045	ROM	008	007	Because the mind of the flesh is enmity against God; for it doth not submit itself to the Law of God, neither indeed can it.
045	ROM	008	008	And they who are in the flesh cannot please God.
045	ROM	008	009	But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwelleth in you. But if any one hath to not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.
045	ROM	008	010	And if Christ is in you, the body indeed is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.
045	ROM	008	011	But if the Spirit of him who raised up Jesus from the dead dwelleth in you, he who raised up Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies, because of his Spirit that dwelleth in you.
045	ROM	008	012	So then, brethren, we are debtors not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh.
045	ROM	008	013	For if ye live according to the flesh, ye are sure to die; but if by the Spirit ye make an end of the deeds of the body, ye will live.
045	ROM	008	014	For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are sons of God.
045	ROM	008	015	For ye did not receive the spirit of bondage so as to be again in fear; but ye received the spirit of adopted children, whereby we cry, Abba, Father!
045	ROM	008	016	The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are children of God;
045	ROM	008	017	and if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and fellow-heirs with Christ; if indeed we are suffering with him, that we may also be glorified with him.
045	ROM	008	018	For I esteem the sufferings of the present time as of no account, when compared with the glory which is about to be revealed to us.
045	ROM	008	019	For the earnest expectation of the creation is waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God.
045	ROM	008	020	For the creation was brought into subjection to vanity not of its own will, but by reason of him who put it into subjection,
045	ROM	008	021	in hope that even the creation itself will be set free from the bondage of corruption and brought into the freedom of the glory of the children of God.
045	ROM	008	022	For we know that the whole creation is together groaning and suffering the pains of labor, up to this time;
045	ROM	008	023	and not only so, but even we ourselves also, though having the first-fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption as sons, for the redemption of our body.
045	ROM	008	024	For we were saved only in hope. But hope which is seen is not hope; how can a man hope for that which he seeth?
045	ROM	008	025	But if we hope for that which we do not see, then do we with patience wait for it.
045	ROM	008	026	In like manner the Spirit also helpeth our weakness; for we know not what to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit itself intercedeth with groans which cannot be expressed in words.
045	ROM	008	027	But he that searcheth the hearts knoweth the mind of the Spirit, because it intercedeth for the holy according to the will of God.
045	ROM	008	028	We know moreover that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to his purpose.
045	ROM	008	029	For he determined beforehand that those whom he foreknew should be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the first-born among many brethren.
045	ROM	008	030	And those whom he before appointed, he also called; and those whom he called, he also accepted as righteous; and those whom he accepted as righteous, he also glorified.
045	ROM	008	031	What shall we then say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?
045	ROM	008	032	He who spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not also with him freely give us all things?
045	ROM	008	033	Who shall bring any charge against the chosen of God? God is he who accepteth them as righteous.
045	ROM	008	034	Who is he that condemneth? Christ is he that died, yea rather, who rose again, who is also at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.
045	ROM	008	035	Who shall separate us from the love of Christ for us? Shall affliction or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword?
045	ROM	008	036	As it is written, “For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we were accounted as sheep for slaughter.”
045	ROM	008	037	Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors, through him that loved us.
045	ROM	008	038	For I am persuaded, that neither death nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers,
045	ROM	008	039	nor height nor depth, nor any other created thing will be able to separate us from the love of God for us, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
045	ROM	009	001	I speak truth in Christ, I do not lie, my conscience bearing witness with me in the Holy Spirit, that
045	ROM	009	002	I have great grief and unceasing anguish in my heart.
045	ROM	009	003	For I could wish to be myself accursed and cast out from Christ in behalf of my brethren, my kinsmen as to the flesh;
045	ROM	009	004	who are Israelites; whom God adopted as sons, whose was the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the Law, and the service of the sanctuary, and the promises;
045	ROM	009	005	whose are the fathers, and from whom, as to the flesh, was the Christ. He who is over all, God, be blessed for ever! Amen.
045	ROM	009	006	Not as though the word of God hath failed; for not all they that are of Israel are Israel;
045	ROM	009	007	nor because they are descendants of Abraham are they all children; but, “Thy offspring shall be reckoned from Isaac.”
045	ROM	009	008	That is, not the children by natural descent are children of God, but the children to whom the promise is made are accounted as the offspring.
045	ROM	009	009	For the word of promise is this: “At this time I will come, and Sarah shall have a son.”
045	ROM	009	010	And not only so, but also when Rebecca had conceived by one man, our father Isaac,
045	ROM	009	011	before the children were born, or had done any thing good or evil, to the end that God's purpose according to election might stand, not depending on works, but on the will of him that calleth,
045	ROM	009	012	it was said to her, “The elder shall serve the younger:”
045	ROM	009	013	as it is written, “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.”
045	ROM	009	014	What then shall we say? Is there injustice with God? Far be it!
045	ROM	009	015	For he saith to Moses, “On whom I have mercy, on him will I have mercy; and on whom I have compassion, on him will I have compassion.”
045	ROM	009	016	So then it dependeth not on him that willeth, nor on him that runneth, but on God who showeth mercy.
045	ROM	009	017	For the Scripture saith to Pharaoh, “For this very purpose did I raise thee up, that I might show forth my power in thee, and that my name might be made known in all the earth.”
045	ROM	009	018	So then he hath mercy on whom he will, and hardeneth whom he will.
045	ROM	009	019	Hence thou wilt say to me, Why then doth he still find fault? for who resisteth his will?
045	ROM	009	020	Nay but, O man, who art thou that makest answer to God? Shall the thing that is wrought say to the workman, Why hast thou made me thus?
045	ROM	009	021	Hath not the potter a right out of the same lump of clay to make one vessel for an honorable use, and another for a dishonorable?
045	ROM	009	022	What if God endured with much patience vessels of wrath fitted for destruction, purposing to manifest his wrath and to make known his power;
045	ROM	009	023	purposing also to make known the riches of his glory upon vessels of mercy, which he had before prepared for glory,
045	ROM	009	024	whom he also called, even us, not only from among the Jews, but also from among the gentiles?
045	ROM	009	025	as he also saith in Hosea, “I will call that my people, which was not my people; and her beloved, that was not beloved.
045	ROM	009	026	And it shall be, that in the place where it was said to them, Ye are not my people, there shall they be called sons of the living God.”
045	ROM	009	027	But Isaiah crieth out concerning Israel, “Though the number of the sons of Israel be as the sand of the sea, only the remnant will be saved.
045	ROM	009	028	For he is accomplishing his word and speedily fulfilling it in righteousness; for a speedily fulfilled word will the Lord execute upon the earth.”
045	ROM	009	029	And as Isaiah hath said before, “Unless the Lord of hosts had left us a seed, we should have become as Sodom, and been made like Gomorrah.”
045	ROM	009	030	What then shall we say? That the gentiles, who did not strive after righteousness, obtained righteousness, but a righteousness which is of faith;
045	ROM	009	031	while Israel, which strove after a law of righteousness, did not attain to a law of righteousness.
045	ROM	009	032	Why? Because they did not strive for it by faith, but as being by works. For they stumbled against the stone of stumbling;
045	ROM	009	033	as it is written, “Behold, I lay in Zion a stone of stumbling and rock of offence; and he that believeth in him shall not be put to shame.”
045	ROM	010	001	Brethren, the desire of my heart and my prayer to God for them is, that they may be saved.
045	ROM	010	002	For I bear them witness that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge.
045	ROM	010	003	For being ignorant of the righteousness which is of God, and endeavoring to establish a righteousness of their own, they have not submitted themselves to the righteousness which is of God.
045	ROM	010	004	For Christ is the end of the Law, so that every one that believeth may obtain righteousness.
045	ROM	010	005	For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the Law: “The man that hath done these things shall live by them.”
045	ROM	010	006	But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh thus: Say not in thy heart, “Who shall ascend into heaven?” that is, to bring Christ down.
045	ROM	010	007	Or, “Who shall descend into the abyss?” that is, to bring up Christ from the dead.
045	ROM	010	008	But what saith it? “The word is nigh thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart;” that is, the word concerning faith, which we preach;
045	ROM	010	009	for if thou shalt acknowledge with thy mouth Jesus as Lord, and shalt believe in thy heart that God raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.
045	ROM	010	010	For with the heart man believeth so as to obtain righteousness, and with the mouth professeth so as to obtain salvation.
045	ROM	010	011	For the Scripture saith, “Whoever believeth in him shall not be put to shame.”
045	ROM	010	012	For there is no difference between Jew and Greek; for one and the same is Lord over all, rich to all that call upon him.
045	ROM	010	013	For “every one who calleth upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.”
045	ROM	010	014	How then shall they call on him, in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him, of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?
045	ROM	010	015	and how shall men preach, unless they are sent forth? as it is written, “How beautiful are the feet of those who bring glad tidings of peace, who bring glad tidings of good things!”
045	ROM	010	016	But they did not all hearken to the glad tidings. For Isaiah saith, “Lord, who hath believed what he hath heard from us?”
045	ROM	010	017	Faith then cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.
045	ROM	010	018	But I say, Did they not hear? Yes truly, “Their voice went forth into all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world.”
045	ROM	010	019	But I say, Hath not Israel had knowledge? First, Moses saith, “I will move you to jealousy by that which is no nation, I will excite you to indignation by a foolish people.”
045	ROM	010	020	But Isaiah is very bold, and saith, “I was found by those who sought me not, I became known to those who inquired not for me.”
045	ROM	010	021	But concerning Israel he saith, “All the day long I have stretched out my hands to a disobedient and rebellious people.”
045	ROM	011	001	I say then, Hath God cast off his people? Far be it I For I myself am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.
045	ROM	011	002	God hath not cast off his people, which he foreknew. Do ye not know what the Scripture saith in the passage concerning Elijah? how he pleadeth to God against Israel:
045	ROM	011	003	“Lord, they have killed thy prophets, they have dug down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they are seeking my life.”
045	ROM	011	004	But what saith the answer of God to him? “I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to Baal.”
045	ROM	011	005	In the same way then at this present time also there is a remnant, according to the election of grace.
045	ROM	011	006	And if it is by grace, it is no longer on account of works; otherwise grace ceaseth to be grace; but if it is of works, there is then no grace; otherwise work ceaseth to be work. How is it then?
045	ROM	011	007	What Israel seeketh after, that Israel did not obtain; but the elect obtained it, and the rest were hardened;
045	ROM	011	008	as it is written: “God gave them a spirit of slumber, eyes that were not to see, and ears that were not to hear, unto this day.”
045	ROM	011	009	And David saith, “Let their table become a snare, and a trap, and a stumbling-block, and a recompense to them;
045	ROM	011	010	let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see; and bow down their back alway.”
045	ROM	011	011	I say then, Did they stumble in order to fall? God forbid! But by their offence salvation is come to the gentiles to excite them to emulation.
045	ROM	011	012	But if their offence is the riches of the world, and their loss the riches of the gentiles, how much more will their fullness be?
045	ROM	011	013	For I am speaking to you gentiles; inasmuch as I am the apostle of the gentiles, I magnify my office,
045	ROM	011	014	that I may, if possible, excite to emulation those who are my flesh, and may save some of them.
045	ROM	011	015	For if the rejection of them is the reconciliation of the world, what will the reception of them be, but life from the dead?
045	ROM	011	016	And if the first portion of the dough is holy, so also will be the lump; and if the root is holy, so will be the branches.
045	ROM	011	017	And if some of the branches have been broken off, and thou, a wild olive, hast been grafted in among them, and become a partaker with them of the root and fatness of the olive-tree,
045	ROM	011	018	boast not over the branches; for if thou boast, thou dost not bear the root, but the root thee.
045	ROM	011	019	Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in.
045	ROM	011	020	Be it so. It was for their unbelief that they were broken off, and thou standest through thy faith; be not high-minded, but fear.
045	ROM	011	021	For if God spared the natural branches, take care lest he spare not thee.
045	ROM	011	022	Behold then the goodness and the severity of God; toward those who fell, severity; but toward thee God's goodness, if thou continue in his goodness; otherwise thou also wilt be cut off.
045	ROM	011	023	And they also, if they do not continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in; for God is able to graft them in again.
045	ROM	011	024	For if thou hast been cut off from an olive-tree wild by nature, and hast against thy nature been ingrafted into a good olive-tree, how much more shall these, the natural branches, be ingrafted into their own olive-stock?
045	ROM	011	025	For I would not have you ignorant, brethren, of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits, that blindness hath to some extent come upon Israel, until the fullness of the gentiles shall have come in.
045	ROM	011	026	And thus will all Israel be saved; as it is written, “There shall come out of Zion the Deliverer; he shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob.
045	ROM	011	027	And this will be my covenant with them, when I shall have taken away their sins.”
045	ROM	011	028	In regard to the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes; but in regard to God's choice, they are beloved for the fathers' sake.
045	ROM	011	029	For in respect to his gifts and his calling, there is no change of purpose with God.
045	ROM	011	030	For as ye in times past were disobedient to God, but have now obtained mercy through their disobedience,
045	ROM	011	031	so they too have now become disobedient, that they also may obtain mercy through the mercy shown to you.
045	ROM	011	032	For God delivered up all to disobedience, that he might have mercy upon all.
045	ROM	011	033	O the depth of the riches, and of the wisdom, and of the knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his purposes, and his ways past finding out!
045	ROM	011	034	For “who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been made his counselor?”
045	ROM	011	035	or “who first gave to him, and shall receive a return?”
045	ROM	011	036	For from him, and through him, and to him are all things. To him be the glory for ever! Amen.
045	ROM	012	001	I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, well-pleasing to God, which is your spiritual worship;
045	ROM	012	002	and be not conformed to the fashion of this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that ye may learn by experience what is the will of God, what is good, and well-pleasing, and perfect.
045	ROM	012	003	For through the grace given to me I warn every one among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but to think soberly, according to the measure of faith which God hath imparted to each.
045	ROM	012	004	For as in one body we have many members, and the members have not all the same office,
045	ROM	012	005	so we, though many, form one body in Christ, and each of us is a member of it in common with the rest.
045	ROM	012	006	Having then gifts which dither according to the grace which hath been bestowed upon us, if we have prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of our faith;
045	ROM	012	007	or if service, let us attend to the service; he that teacheth, let him attend to teaching;
045	ROM	012	008	or he that exhorteth, to exhortation; he that giveth, let him do it with liberality; he that presideth over others, with diligence; he that doeth deeds of mercy, with cheerfulness.
045	ROM	012	009	Let your love be unfeigned. Abhor that which is evil, cleave to that which is good.
045	ROM	012	010	In brotherly love, be affectionate to one another; in honor, give each other the preference.
045	ROM	012	011	Be not backward in zeal; be fervent in spirit; serving the Lord.
045	ROM	012	012	Rejoice in hope; be patient in affliction; persevere in prayer.
045	ROM	012	013	Relieve the wants of the holy; be given to hospitality.
045	ROM	012	014	Bless those who persecute you; bless, and curse not.
045	ROM	012	015	Rejoice with those who rejoice; weep with those who weep.
045	ROM	012	016	Be of one mind among yourselves. Set not your minds on high things, but content yourselves with what is humble. Be not wise in your own conceits.
045	ROM	012	017	Render to no one evil for evil; have regard to what is honorable in the sight of all men.
045	ROM	012	018	If it be possible, as far as dependeth on you, be at peace with all men.
045	ROM	012	019	Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather make room for wrath; for it is written, “Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.”
045	ROM	012	020	Therefore, “if thy enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink. For in so doing thou wilt heap coals of fire on his head.”
045	ROM	012	021	Be not overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.
045	ROM	013	001	Let every one submit to the authorities that are over him; for there is no authority which is not from God: and the authorities which exist have been ordained by God.
045	ROM	013	002	He therefore that setteth himself against the authority resisteth what God hath ordained; and they a who resist will bring upon themselves judgment.
045	ROM	013	003	For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wouldst thou then not be afraid of the government? Do that which is good, and thou wilt have praise from it;
045	ROM	013	004	for the ruler is God's servant to thee for good. But if thou doest evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain; for he is God's servant, an avenger to inflict wrath upon him that doeth evil.
045	ROM	013	005	It is necessary therefore to submit, not only because of the wrath, but also for your conscience' sake.
045	ROM	013	006	For the same reason pay tribute also; for they are ministers of God, attending continually to this very business.
045	ROM	013	007	Render to all what is due to them; tribute, to whom tribute is due; custom, to whom custom; fear, to whom fear; honor, to whom honor.
045	ROM	013	008	Owe no one anything but brotherly love; for he that loveth others hath fulfilled the Law.
045	ROM	013	009	For these, “Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not covet,” and every other commandment, are summed up in this precept, “Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.”
045	ROM	013	010	Love worketh no ill to one's neighbor; therefore love is the fulfilling of the Law.
045	ROM	013	011	And this, since we know the time, that it is already high time for us to awake out of sleep; for now is our salvation nearer than when we became believers.
045	ROM	013	012	The night is far spent, the day is at hand; let us then throw off the works of darkness, and put on the armor of light.
045	ROM	013	013	Let us walk becomingly, as in the day; not in reveling and drunkenness, not in lewdness and wantonness, not in strife and envy;
045	ROM	013	014	but clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ, and think not about satisfying the lusts of the flesh.
045	ROM	014	001	Him that is weak in his faith receive with kindness, and not to pass judgment on his thoughts.
045	ROM	014	002	One man hath faith to eat every kind of food; another, who is weak, eateth herbs only.
045	ROM	014	003	Let not him who eateth, despise him that eateth not; and let not him who eateth not, judge him that eateth; for God hath received him.
045	ROM	014	004	Who art thou that judgest the servant of another? To his own lord he standeth or falleth; and he shall be made to stand; for the Lord is able to make him stand.
045	ROM	014	005	One man esteemeth one day above another; another esteemeth every day alike: let each one be fully persuaded in his own mind. He that regardeth the day, regardeth it to the Lord;
045	ROM	014	006	and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it. And he that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth thanks to God; and he that doth not eat, to the Lord he doth not eat, and giveth thanks to God.
045	ROM	014	007	For none of us liveth to himself, and no one dieth to himself.
045	ROM	014	008	For if we live, we live to the Lord; and if we die, we die to the Lord. Whether then we live or die, we are the Lord's.
045	ROM	014	009	For to this end Christ died and lived again, that he might be Lord both of the dead and the living.
045	ROM	014	010	But thou, why dost thou judge thy brother? And thou, too, why dost thou despise thy brother? For we shall all stand before the judgment-seat of God.
045	ROM	014	011	For it is written, “As I live, saith the Lord, to me every knee shall bow, and every tongue shall give praise to God.”
045	ROM	014	012	So then every one of us will give account of himself to God.
045	ROM	014	013	Let us then no longer judge one another; but let this rather be your judgment, not to put a stumbling-block, or an occasion to fall, in a brother's way.
045	ROM	014	014	I know, and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean in itself; but to him that accounteth anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean.
045	ROM	014	015	For if on account of food thy brother is made to mourn, thou art no longer walking according to love. Do not with thy food destroy him for whom Christ died.
045	ROM	014	016	Let not then the blessing which ye enjoy be evil spoken of.
045	ROM	014	017	For the kingdom of God is not food and drink, but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit;
045	ROM	014	018	for he who in this matter serveth Christ is well-pleasing to God, and approved by men.
045	ROM	014	019	Let us then strive to promote peace, and the edification of each other.
045	ROM	014	020	Do not for the sake of food undo the work of God. All things indeed are clean; but that which is pure is evil for that man who eateth so as to be an occasion of sin.
045	ROM	014	021	It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor to do anything whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is put in danger of falling, or is made weak.
045	ROM	014	022	Thou hast faith; have it to thyself before God. Happy is he who doth not condemn himself in that which he alloweth.
045	ROM	014	023	But he that doubteth is condemned if he eat, because he doeth it not from faith; but every thing which is not from faith is sin.
045	ROM	015	001	We then who are strong ought to hear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.
045	ROM	015	002	Let each one of us please his neighbor, to promote what is good, for edification.
045	ROM	015	003	For Christ did not seek his own pleasure, but, as it is written, “The reproaches of those who reproached thee fell on me.”
045	ROM	015	004	For whatever things were written aforetime, were written for our instruction; that we through the patience and the consolation of the Scriptures might have hope.
045	ROM	015	005	And may the God of patience and consolation grant that ye may be of the same mind one with another, according to Christ Jesus;
045	ROM	015	006	that with one accord ye may with one mouth glorify God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
045	ROM	015	007	Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ received you to the glory of God.
045	ROM	015	008	For I say that Christ became a minister to the circumcised for the sake of God's truth, in order to make sure the promises given to the fathers;
045	ROM	015	009	and that the gentiles glorified God for his mercy, as it is written, “For this cause I will give praise to thee among the gentiles, and sing to thy name.”
045	ROM	015	010	And again he saith: “Rejoice, ye gentiles, with his people.”
045	ROM	015	011	And again: “Praise the Lord, all ye gentiles, and let every people praise him.”
045	ROM	015	012	And again Isaiah saith: “There shall be the shoot from Jesse, and he that riseth up to rule the gentiles; in him shall the gentiles hope.”
045	ROM	015	013	And may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Spirit.
045	ROM	015	014	But I myself am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye are even of yourselves full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.
045	ROM	015	015	But I have written to you, brethren, in a manner somewhat bold on some subjects, as putting you in mind, on account of the grace given me by God
045	ROM	015	016	that I should be a minister of Christ Jesus to the gentiles, performing the office of a priest in respect to the gospel of God, that the oblation of the gentiles may be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit.
045	ROM	015	017	I have then ground for glorying in Christ Jesus in regard to the things pertaining m God.
045	ROM	015	018	For I will not be bold to say anything hut of what Christ hath actually wrought by me to bring the gentiles to obedience by word and deed,
045	ROM	015	019	by the power of signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit; so that from Jerusalem, and in the country around even to Illyricum, I have fully made known the gospel of Christ;
045	ROM	015	020	but always earnestly desirous to preach it in this manner, —not where Christ had been named, that I might not build on another's foundation,
045	ROM	015	021	but, as it is written: “They, to whom no tidings concerning him came, shall see; and they that have not heard shall understand.”
045	ROM	015	022	For which cause also, for the most part, I have been hindered from coming to you.
045	ROM	015	023	But now having no more opportunity in these regions, and having had for many years a great desire to come to you,
045	ROM	015	024	when I go to Spain, I will come to you; for I hope to see you on my way, and to be helped forward thither by you, after I have in some degree satisfied myself with your company.
045	ROM	015	025	But now I am going to Jerusalem on a service of relief to the saints.
045	ROM	015	026	For Macedonia and Achaia have thought it good to make a contribution for the poor among the saints in Jerusalem.
045	ROM	015	027	They have thought it good, and they owed it to them. For if the gentiles have shared in their spiritual things, they ought in return to minister to them in temporal things.
045	ROM	015	028	When therefore I have completed this business, and secured to them this fruit, I shall set out to pass through you to Spain.
045	ROM	015	029	And I know that when I come to you, I shall come in the fullness of the blessing of Christ.
045	ROM	015	030	But I beseech you, by our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the love produced by the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in prayers to God for me;
045	ROM	015	031	that I may be delivered from the unbelievers in Judaea, and that my service for Jerusalem may prove acceptable to the saints;
045	ROM	015	032	so that, through the will of God, I may come to you in joy, and may with you be refreshed.
045	ROM	015	033	And may the God of peace be with you all. Amen.
045	ROM	016	001	I commend to you Phoebe our sister, who is a deaconess of the church at Cenchreae;
045	ROM	016	002	that ye may receive her in the Lord in a manner worthy of the holy, and assist her in whatever business she may need your aid; for she hath been a helper of many, and of myself also.
045	ROM	016	003	Salute Prisca and Aquila, my fellow-laborers in Christ Jesus;
045	ROM	016	004	who for my life laid down their own necks; to whom not I alone give thanks, but also all the churches of the gentiles;
045	ROM	016	005	salute also the church that is in their house. Salute Epaenetus, my beloved, who is the first fruit gathered from Asia for Christ.
045	ROM	016	006	Salute Mary, who labored much for us.
045	ROM	016	007	Salute Andronicus and Junias, my kinsmen, and my fellow-prisoners, who are of note among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me.
045	ROM	016	008	Salute Amplias, my beloved in the Lord.
045	ROM	016	009	Salute Urbanus, our fellow-laborer in Christ, and Stachys, my beloved.
045	ROM	016	010	Salute Apelles, the approved in Christ. Salute those who belong to the family of Aristobulus.
045	ROM	016	011	Salute Herodion, my kinsman. Salute those of the family of Narcissus, who are in the Lord.
045	ROM	016	012	Salute Tryphaena and Tryphosa, who labor in the Lord. Salute Persis, the beloved, who labored much in the Lord.
045	ROM	016	013	Salute Rufus, the chosen in the Lord, and his mother, who is mine also.
045	ROM	016	014	Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and the brethren that are with them.
045	ROM	016	015	Salute Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints who are with them.
045	ROM	016	016	Salute each other with a holy kiss. All the churches of Christ salute you.
045	ROM	016	017	But I exhort your brethren, to mark those who are causing divisions and offences, contrary to the doctrine which ye learned; and avoid them.
045	ROM	016	018	For such men are not servants of our Lord Christ, but of their own appetites; and by good words and fair speeches they deceive the hearts of the simple.
045	ROM	016	019	For your obedience hath become known to all. Over you, then, I rejoice; but I would have you wise as to that which is good, and simple as to that which is evil.
045	ROM	016	020	And the God of peace will soon beat down Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
045	ROM	016	021	Timothy, my fellow-laborer, salutes you, and Lucius and Jason and Sosipater my kinsmen.
045	ROM	016	022	I Tertius, who wrote this letter, salute you in the Lord.
045	ROM	016	023	Gaius my host, and the host of the whole church, saluteth you. Erastus the treasurer of the city saluteth you, and Quartus, the brother.
045	ROM	016	024	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
045	ROM	016	025	Now to him who is able to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery which for eternal ages was unrevealed,
045	ROM	016	026	but is now made manifest, and through the writings of the prophets, by the command of the everlasting God, is made known to all the nations to bring them to obedience to the faith, —
045	ROM	016	027	to God, the only wise, through Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory for ever! Amen.

# BOOK	046	1CO	1 Corinthians	1 Corinthians
046	1CO	001	001	Paul, a called apostle of Christ Jesus, through the will of God, and Sosthenes the brother,
046	1CO	001	002	to the church of God which is at Corinth, the sanctified in Christ Jesus, called, holy, with all that in every place call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, their Lord and ours;
046	1CO	001	003	grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
046	1CO	001	004	I ever thank my God for you, on account of the grace of God bestowed upon you in Christ Jesus;
046	1CO	001	005	that in him ye were enriched in everything, in all utterance, and all knowledge,
046	1CO	001	006	as the testimony of Christ was established among you;
046	1CO	001	007	so that ye come behind in no gift, while waiting for the manifestation of our Lord Jesus Christ;
046	1CO	001	008	who will also make you steadfast to the end, so that ye may be without blame in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.
046	1CO	001	009	God is faithful, by whom ye were called into the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.
046	1CO	001	010	But I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you, but that ye be perfectly united in the same mind and in the same judgment.
046	1CO	001	011	For I have been informed concerning you, my brethren, by those of the family of Chloe, that there are dissensions among you.
046	1CO	001	012	What I mean is this, that each of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.
046	1CO	001	013	Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were ye baptized the name of Paul?
046	1CO	001	014	I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;
046	1CO	001	015	that no one may say that ye were baptized into my name.
046	1CO	001	016	And I baptized also the household of Stephanas; I am not aware that I baptized any one besides.
046	1CO	001	017	For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel; not with wisdom of speech, lest the cross of Christ should be made of no effect.
046	1CO	001	018	For the preaching of the cross is to those who are perishing, foolishness, but to us who are being saved, it is the power of God.
046	1CO	001	019	For it is written: “I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nought the discernment of the discerning.”
046	1CO	001	020	Where is the wise man? Where the scribe? Where the disputer of this world? Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?
046	1CO	001	021	For since, in the wisdom of God, the world by its wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save those who believe;
046	1CO	001	022	since even Jews ask for signs, and the Greeks seek for wisdom;
046	1CO	001	023	but we preach Christ crucified, to Jews a stumbling-block, and to gentiles foolishness,
046	1CO	001	024	but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.
046	1CO	001	025	Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.
046	1CO	001	026	For consider, brethren, who ye are that have been called; not many wise men after the fashion of the world, not many mighty, not many noble;
046	1CO	001	027	but the foolish things of the world did God choose, to put to shame the wise; and the weak things of the world did God choose, to put to shame the things which are strong;
046	1CO	001	028	and the mean things of the world, and the things which are despised, did God choose, the things which are not, to bring to nought things that are;
046	1CO	001	029	that no flesh might glory before God.
046	1CO	001	030	But from him it is that ye are in Christ Jesus, who from God was made to us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption;
046	1CO	001	031	that, according as it is written, “He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.”
046	1CO	002	001	And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech, or of wisdom, declaring to you the testimony of God.
046	1CO	002	002	For I determined not to know anything while with you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.
046	1CO	002	003	And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling;
046	1CO	002	004	and my speech and my preaching were not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit, and of power;
046	1CO	002	005	that your faith might not rest on the wisdom of men, but on the power of God.
046	1CO	002	006	But we do speak wisdom among the perfect; not, however, the wisdom of this world, nor of the rulers of this world, who are coming to nought;
046	1CO	002	007	but we speak God's wisdom in a mystery, the hidden wisdom, which God determined on before the world was, for our glory;
046	1CO	002	008	which none of the rulers of this world comprehended; for had they comprehended it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory;
046	1CO	002	009	but, as it is written: “The things which eye hath not seen, and ear hath not heard, and which have not entered into the heart of man, the great things which God hath prepared for those that love him.”
046	1CO	002	010	For God hath revealed them to us by his Spirit; for the Spirit searcheth all things, even the depths of God.
046	1CO	002	011	For who among men knoweth the things of a man, but the spirit of the man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no one but the Spirit of God.
046	1CO	002	012	But we did not receive the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is from God, that we might know the things that have been given to us by the grace of God;
046	1CO	002	013	which things we also speak, not in words taught by man's wisdom, but in those taught by the Spirit, connecting what is spiritual l with what is spiritual.
046	1CO	002	014	But the unspiritual man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God; for they are foolishness to him, and he cannot know them; because they are spiritually discerned.
046	1CO	002	015	But he that is spiritual judgeth of all things, yet he himself is judged by no one.
046	1CO	002	016	For “who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him?” But we have the mind of Christ.
046	1CO	003	001	I also, brethren, was not able to speak to you as to spiritual men, but as those who are not spiritual, as to babes in Christ.
046	1CO	003	002	I fed you with milk, not with meat; for ye were not yet able to bear it. Nor indeed are ye able even now;
046	1CO	003	003	for ye are yet unspiritual. For while there is among you rivalry and strife, are ye not unspiritual, and walking after the manner of men?
046	1CO	003	004	For while one saith, I am of Paul, and another, I am of Apollos, are ye not [[like common]] men?
046	1CO	003	005	Who then is Apollos, and who is Paul, but ministers through whom ye believed, and that as the Lord gave to each?
046	1CO	003	006	I planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the growth.
046	1CO	003	007	So then, neither he that planteth nor he that watereth is anything, but God that giveth the growth.
046	1CO	003	008	And he that planteth and he that watereth are one; and each will receive his own reward, according to his own labor.
046	1CO	003	009	For we are God's fellow-laborers; ye are God's field, ye are God's building.
046	1CO	003	010	According to the grace of God bestowed on me, I, as a skilful master-builder, have laid the foundation; and another buildeth thereon; but let every one take heed, how he buildeth thereon.
046	1CO	003	011	For other foundation can no one lay than that which is laid, which is Christ Jesus.
046	1CO	003	012	But if any one build upon this foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble,
046	1CO	003	013	the work of every one will be made manifest; for the day will show it; because it is revealed in fire; and the fire itself will prove what every one's work is.
046	1CO	003	014	If the work which any one built thereon remaineth, he will receive reward;
046	1CO	003	015	if any one's work shall be burned up, he will lose the reward; but he will be saved himself, yet as one escaping through fire.
046	1CO	003	016	Know ye not, that ye are God's temple, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?
046	1CO	003	017	If any one defaceth the temple of God, God will deface him; for the temple of God is holy, and such are ye.
046	1CO	003	018	Let no one deceive himself; if any one thinketh himself wise among you in this world, let him become a fool, that he may become wise.
046	1CO	003	019	For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God; for it is written: “He that taketh the wise in their craftiness;”
046	1CO	003	020	and again: “The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.”
046	1CO	003	021	So then let no one glory in men. For all things are yours;
046	1CO	003	022	whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come, —all are yours;
046	1CO	003	023	and ye are Christ's, and Christ is God's.
046	1CO	004	001	Let a man so account us, as servants of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.
046	1CO	004	002	Here moreover, it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.
046	1CO	004	003	But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you, or by a human tribunal; nay, I do not even judge myself;
046	1CO	004	004	for though I am conscious to myself of nothing wrong, yet not by this am I cleared of blame; but he that judgeth me is the Lord.
046	1CO	004	005	So then judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and make manifest the purposes of men's hearts; and then shall every one have his praise from God.
046	1CO	004	006	And these things, brethren, I have transferred in a figure to myself and Apollos for your sakes, that in us ye may learn not to go beyond what is written, that no one of you may pride himself in one against another.
046	1CO	004	007	For who maketh thee to differ from another? And what hast thou that thou didst not receive? But if thou didst receive it, why dost thou boast, as if thou hadst not received it?
046	1CO	004	008	Already ye are full; already ye are rich; without us ye have become kings; and I would indeed ye were kings, that we also might reign with you.
046	1CO	004	009	For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles as lowest, as men sentenced to death; for we have been made a spectacle to the world, to angels, and to men.
046	1CO	004	010	We are fools for Christ's sake, but ye are wise in Christ; we are weak, but ye are strong; ye are in honor, but we are despised.
046	1CO	004	011	Even to this very hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwelling-place,
046	1CO	004	012	and labor, working with our own hands; being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we endure it;
046	1CO	004	013	being slandered, we exhort; we have become as the filth of the world, the off-scouring of all things until now.
046	1CO	004	014	I write not these things to shame you, but I am warning you as my beloved children.
046	1CO	004	015	For though ye have ten thousand teachers in Christ, yet have ye not many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I begot you through the gospel.
046	1CO	004	016	I exhort you therefore, be ye imitators of me.
046	1CO	004	017	For this end I sent to you Timothy, who is my beloved child, and faithful in the Lord, who will put you in mind of my ways in Christ, according as I teach everywhere in every church.
046	1CO	004	018	Now some are puffed up, as though I were not coming to you.
046	1CO	004	019	But I shall come to you shortly, if it be the Lord's will, and will know, not the word of those who are puffed up, but the power;
046	1CO	004	020	for the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.
046	1CO	004	021	What will ye? Am I to come to you with a rod, or in love, and the spirit of mildness?
046	1CO	005	001	It is everywhere reported that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not even among the gentiles, that one should have his father's wife.
046	1CO	005	002	And ye are puffed up, and did not rather mourn, so that he that committed this deed might be separated from among you.
046	1CO	005	003	For I, for my part, though absent in the body, yet present in the spirit have already determined, as if I were present with you, respecting him who thus wrought this deed,
046	1CO	005	004	in the name of our Lord Jesus, when you and my spirit with you are assembled together, with the power of our Lord Jesus,
046	1CO	005	005	to deliver such a man over to Satan for the destruction of his flesh, that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord.
046	1CO	005	006	Your glorying is not good. Know ye not, that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?
046	1CO	005	007	Cleanse out the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened; for our passover also hath been sacrificed, even Christ.
046	1CO	005	008	So then let us keep the feast, not with the old leaven, nor with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
046	1CO	005	009	I wrote to you in that letter, not to keep company with fornicators;
046	1CO	005	010	certainly not meaning the fornicators of this world, or the covetous and extortioners, or idolaters; for to do this ye must go out of the world.
046	1CO	005	011	But this is what I wrote you, not to keep company with any one called a brother, if he be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such a one not even to eat.
046	1CO	005	012	For what have I to do with judging those who are without? Do not ye judge those who are within?
046	1CO	005	013	But those who are without, God will judge. Do ye put away that bad man from among yourselves.
046	1CO	006	001	Doth any one of you, who hath a matter against another, dare to go to law before the unrighteous, and not before the holy?
046	1CO	006	002	Or do ye not know, that the holy will judge the world? And if the world is to be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge in causes of the least importance?
046	1CO	006	003	Know ye not, that we shall pass judgment upon angels? How much more, concerning affairs of this life?
046	1CO	006	004	If then ye have any causes relating to this life, set them to judge who are of no repute in the church.
046	1CO	006	005	I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you, not one that will be able to judge between his brethren?
046	1CO	006	006	Nay, brother goeth to law with brother, and that before unbelievers.
046	1CO	006	007	Now therefore it is altogether an evil among you, that ye have suits against each other. Why do ye not rather submit to wrong? Why do ye not rather allow yourselves to be defrauded?
046	1CO	006	008	But ye yourselves wrong, and defraud, and that too your brethren.
046	1CO	006	009	Know ye not, that wrongdoers shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor the effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,
046	1CO	006	010	nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.
046	1CO	006	011	And such were some of you; but ye were washed, but ye were made holy, but ye were accepted as righteous in the name of the Lord Jesus, and in the Spirit of our God.
046	1CO	006	012	All things are lawful for me, but all things are not profitable; all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of anything.
046	1CO	006	013	Meats are for the stomach, and the stomach for meats; but God will make an end of both it and them. But the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body;
046	1CO	006	014	and God both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his power.
046	1CO	006	015	Know ye not, that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them members of a harlot? God forbid!
046	1CO	006	016	Know ye not, that he who is connected with a harlot is one body with her? “For the two,” saith he, “shall become one flesh;”
046	1CO	006	017	but he that is connected with the Lord is one spirit with him.
046	1CO	006	018	Flee fornication. Every other sin which a man may commit, is apart from the body; but he that committeth fornication, sinneth against his own body.
046	1CO	006	019	Know ye not, that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit which is in you, which ye have from God, and that ye are not your own?
046	1CO	006	020	For ye were bought with a price. Therefore glorify God in your body.
046	1CO	007	001	Now as to the matters about which ye wrote, it is good for a man not to touch a woman;
046	1CO	007	002	but on account of the commonness of fornication, let every man have his own wife, and every woman her own husband.
046	1CO	007	003	Let the husband render to his wife her due; and so also the wife to her husband.
046	1CO	007	004	The wife hath not the disposal of her own body, but her husband; and so also the husband hath not the disposal of his own body, but his wife.
046	1CO	007	005	Defraud not one another, except by agreement for a time, that ye may have a season for prayer; and be together again, that Satan may not tempt you through your incontinence.
046	1CO	007	006	But I say this by way of permission, not command.
046	1CO	007	007	I would that all men were as I myself; but every one hath his own gift from God, one man this, and another that.
046	1CO	007	008	I say also to the unmarried and the widows, it is good for them to remain as I am;
046	1CO	007	009	but if they cannot control themselves, let them marry; for it is better to marry than to burn.
046	1CO	007	010	But to those who are married it is my command, yet not mine, but the Lord's: Let not the wife separate herself from her husband,
046	1CO	007	011	and if she have separated herself let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband; and let not the husband put away his wife.
046	1CO	007	012	But to the rest say I, not the Lord: If any brother hath an unbelieving wife, and she be satisfied to dwell with him, let him not put her away;
046	1CO	007	013	and if a wife hath an unbelieving husband, and he be satisfied to dwell with her, let her not put her husband away.
046	1CO	007	014	For the unbelieving husband hath been made holy by his wife, and the unbelieving wife hath been made holy by the brother; otherwise were your children unclean, but, as it is, they are holy.
046	1CO	007	015	But if the unbelieving separateth himself, let him separate himself; a brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases. But God hath called you to be in peace.
046	1CO	007	016	For how dost thou know, O wife, but that thou mayst save thy husband? or how dost thou know, O husband, but that thou mayst save thy wife?
046	1CO	007	017	But let every one continue to walk in the lot which the Lord appointed him, in the condition in which God called him. And this direction I give in all the churches.
046	1CO	007	018	Was any one called being circumcised, let him not become as if uncircumcised; hath any one been called in uncircumcision, let him not become circumcised.
046	1CO	007	019	Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.
046	1CO	007	020	Let every one remain in the same calling in which he was called.
046	1CO	007	021	Wast thou called being a slave, care not for it; but even if thou canst be made free, use it rather.
046	1CO	007	022	For he that was called in the Lord, being a slave, is the Lord's freeman. In like manner the freeman, who is called, is Christ's slave.
046	1CO	007	023	Ye were bought with a price; become not the slaves of men.
046	1CO	007	024	In that state, brethren, in which he was called, let every one remain with God.
046	1CO	007	025	Now concerning virgins, I have no commandment of the Lord; but I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.
046	1CO	007	026	I think, then, that it is well, on account of the impending distress, for a man to remain as he is.
046	1CO	007	027	Art thou bound to a wife, seek not to be loosed from her; art thou loosed from a wife, do not seek for one.
046	1CO	007	028	But if thou hast married, thou hast committed no sin; and if a virgin hath married, she hath committed no sin. Such, however, will have trouble in the flesh, which I desire to spare you.
046	1CO	007	029	But this I say, brethren, the time that remaineth is short; that both they that have wives may be as though they had none;
046	1CO	007	030	and they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not;
046	1CO	007	031	and they that use this world as not abusing it; for the outward condition of this world is passing away;
046	1CO	007	032	and I would have you free from anxious cares. He that is unmarried careth about the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord;
046	1CO	007	033	but he that is married careth about the things of the world, how to please his wife.
046	1CO	007	034	There is a difference also between a wife and a virgin; the unmarried woman careth about the things of the Lord, to be holy, both in body and in spirit; but she that is married careth about the things of the world, how to please her husband.
046	1CO	007	035	And this I say for your own profit; not to cast a noose over you, but with a view to what is becoming, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction.
046	1CO	007	036	But if any one thinketh that he behaveth improperly in respect to his virgin [[daughter]], if she pass the flower of her age [[without being married]], and if it must be so, let him do what he will, he committeth no sin; let them marry.
046	1CO	007	037	But if any one is settled in his purpose, and is under no necessity, but is free to act as he will, and hath determined in his heart to keep his own virgin daughter [[unmarried]], he doeth well.
046	1CO	007	038	So then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well; and he that doth not give her in marriage doeth better.
046	1CO	007	039	The wife is bound to her husband as long as he liveth; but if her husband die, she is free to marry whom she will, only in the Lord.
046	1CO	007	040	But she is happier if she remain as she is, in my opinion; and I too think that I have the Spirit of God.
046	1CO	008	001	Now concerning the things offered in sacrifice to idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but love edifieth;
046	1CO	008	002	if any one think that he knoweth anything, he knoweth nothing yet, as he ought to know;
046	1CO	008	003	but if any one love God, the same is known by Him.
046	1CO	008	004	Concerning the eating of the things offered in sacrifice to idols, then, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no other God but one.
046	1CO	008	005	For though there are those that are called gods, whether in heaven or on earth; as there are gods many, and lords many;
046	1CO	008	006	yet to us there is but one God, the Father, from whom are all things, and we to him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we through him.
046	1CO	008	007	But there is not in all men this knowledge; for some, with a conscience directed toward the idol even now, eat of it as a thing offered in sacrifice to an idol, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.
046	1CO	008	008	But food will not recommend us to God; if we do not eat, we are not the worse; nor if we do eat, are we the better.
046	1CO	008	009	But take heed, lest this liberty of yours become a stumbling-block to the weak.
046	1CO	008	010	For if any one see thee, who hast knowledge, at table in an idol's temple, will not the conscience of him that is weak be emboldened to eat the things offered to idols?
046	1CO	008	011	For through thy knowledge he that is weak perisheth, —the brother for whom Christ died!
046	1CO	008	012	But when ye so sin against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ.
046	1CO	008	013	Wherefore, if food cause my brother to fall, I will eat no flesh for ever, lest I cause my brother to fall. Am I not free?
046	1CO	009	001	Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are not ye my work in the Lord?
046	1CO	009	002	If I am not an apostle to others, yet surely I am to you; for the seal of my apostleship are ye in the Lord.
046	1CO	009	003	This is my answer to those who question my authority.
046	1CO	009	004	Have we not a right to eat and drink?
046	1CO	009	005	Have we not a right to carry about with us a sister as a wife, as well as the other apostles, and the brothers of the Lord, and Cephas?
046	1CO	009	006	Or am I alone and Barnabas bound to labor with our own hands?
046	1CO	009	007	Who ever serveth as a soldier at his own charges? Who planteth a vineyard without eating its fruit? Or who tendeth a flock and doth not eat of the milk of the flock?
046	1CO	009	008	Is it on man's authority that I am saying these things, or doth not the Law too say the same?
046	1CO	009	009	For it is written in the law of Moses: “Thou shalt not muzzle an ox while treading out grain.” Is it for oxen that God careth?
046	1CO	009	010	Or doth he say it altogether on our account? On our account, no doubt, it was written, that he who plougheth ought to plough in hope, and that he who thrasheth should do it in the hope of partaking.
046	1CO	009	011	If we have sown to you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we reap from you things for the body?
046	1CO	009	012	If others possess this right in relation to you, do not we still more? But we have not used this right; but we submit to all things, that we may occasion no hindrance to the gospel of Christ.
046	1CO	009	013	Do ye not know, that they who minister in the offerings of the temple live from the temple? that they who serve at the altar share with the altar?
046	1CO	009	014	In like manner also did the Lord ordain that they who preach the gospel should live from the gospel.
046	1CO	009	015	But I have used no right of this kind; nor have I written thus that anything of this kind should be done for me; for it were better for me to die, than that any one should take from me what I glory in.
046	1CO	009	016	For in preaching the gospel, I have nothing to glory in; for I am under a necessity to do so; yea, woe is to me, if I preach not the gospel!
046	1CO	009	017	For if I do this willingly, I have a reward; but if unwillingly, still I have been intrusted with a stewardship.
046	1CO	009	018	What then is my reward? It is that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel free of charge, that I use not to the full my right as a preacher of the gospel.
046	1CO	009	019	For being free from all men, yet I made myself a servant to all, that I might gain the more;
046	1CO	009	020	and to the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain Jews; to those under the Law, as under the Law, not being myself under the Law, that I might gain those under the Law;
046	1CO	009	021	to those without the Law, as without the Law, being not without a law before God, but under the law of Christ, that I might gain those without the Law;
046	1CO	009	022	to the weak I became weak, that I might gain the weak; I have become all things to all, that I might by all means save some.
046	1CO	009	023	And I do all for the sake of the gospel, that I may with others partake of it.
046	1CO	009	024	Know ye not, that of those who run in the race-course all run, but one receiveth the prize? Thus run, that ye may obtain.
046	1CO	009	025	And every one who contendeth in the games is temperate in all things; they, however, to obtain a perishable crown, but we, an imperishable.
046	1CO	009	026	I therefore so run, not as one uncertain; I so fight, not as one striking the air;
046	1CO	009	027	but I beat down my body, and bring it into subjection, lest perhaps, when I have been a herald to others, I should myself be rejected as unworthy.
046	1CO	010	001	For I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea,
046	1CO	010	002	and were all baptized to Moses in the cloud and in the sea,
046	1CO	010	003	and all ate the same spiritual food,
046	1CO	010	004	and all drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank of the spiritual rock that accompanied them; and the rock was Christ;
046	1CO	010	005	but with most of them God was not well pleased; for they were laid low in the wilderness.
046	1CO	010	006	Now these things were warnings for us, in order that we should not lust after evil things, as they lusted.
046	1CO	010	007	And do not ye become idolaters, as some of them did; as it is written: “The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to sport.”
046	1CO	010	008	Nor let us commit fornication, as some of them did, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand.
046	1CO	010	009	Nor let us tempt Christ, as some of them tempted, and were destroyed by the serpents.
046	1CO	010	010	And do not ye murmur, as some of them murmured, and perished by the Destroyer.
046	1CO	010	011	Now these things happened to them as warnings, and were recorded for our admonition, to whom the ends of the ages have come.
046	1CO	010	012	Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth, take heed lest he fall.
046	1CO	010	013	No temptation hath come upon you, but such as is common to man; but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted beyond what ye are able to endure, but will with the temptation furnish also the way to escape, that ye may be able to endure it.
046	1CO	010	014	Wherefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry.
046	1CO	010	015	I speak as to wise men, judge ye what I say.
046	1CO	010	016	The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a partaking of the blood of Christ? the loaf which we break, is it not a partaking of the body of Christ?
046	1CO	010	017	For we, the many, are one loaf, one body; for we all share in that one loaf.
046	1CO	010	018	Look at Israel by natural descent. Have not those who eat of the sacrifices, communion with the altar?
046	1CO	010	019	What do I say then? That what is offered in sacrifice to idols is anything? Or that an idol is anything?
046	1CO	010	020	Nay, but that what they sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons, and not to God; and I would not that ye should have communion with demons.
046	1CO	010	021	Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of demons; ye cannot be partakers of the Lord's table, and the table of demons.
046	1CO	010	022	Shall we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than he?
046	1CO	010	023	All things are lawful, but all things are not profitable; all things are lawful, but all things are not edifying.
046	1CO	010	024	Let no one seek his own pleasure, but the good of others.
046	1CO	010	025	Whatever is sold in the market that eat, without asking questions for the sake of conscience;
046	1CO	010	026	for “the earth is the Lord's, and the fullness thereof.”
046	1CO	010	027	And if one who is an unbeliever inviteth you to a feast, and ye choose to go, eat whatever is set before you, without asking any questions for the sake of conscience.
046	1CO	010	028	But if any one say to you, This hath been offered in sacrifice to an idol, do not eat of it, on account of him that showed you this, and from a regard to conscience;
046	1CO	010	029	conscience I mean, not thine own, but that of the other. For why is my liberty to be judged by another conscience [[than my own]]?
046	1CO	010	030	If I partake with thankfulness, why am I to be evil spoken of in a matter for which I give thanks?
046	1CO	010	031	Whether therefore ye eat or drink, or whatever ye do, do all to the glory of God.
046	1CO	010	032	Give no occasion of stumbling either to Jews or Greeks, or to the church of God;
046	1CO	010	033	as I also strive to please all in all things, not seeking my own advantage, but that of the many; that they may be saved.
046	1CO	011	001	Follow my example, as I do that of Christ.
046	1CO	011	002	Now I praise you, brethren, that in all things ye remember me, and hold fast the instructions, as I delivered them to you.
046	1CO	011	003	But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.
046	1CO	011	004	Every man that prayeth or prophesieth having his head covered, dishonoreth his head.
046	1CO	011	005	But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoreth her head; for it is one and the same thing as if her head were shaved.
046	1CO	011	006	For if a woman is not veiled, let her also be shorn; but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be veiled.
046	1CO	011	007	For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of the man;
046	1CO	011	008	for the man is not from the woman, but the woman from the man;
046	1CO	011	009	and the man was not created for the woman, but the woman for the man.
046	1CO	011	010	For this cause the woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head, because of the angels.
046	1CO	011	011	But neither is the woman without the man, nor the man without the woman, in the Lord.
046	1CO	011	012	For as the woman is from the man, so also is the man by the woman; but all things from God.
046	1CO	011	013	Judge in your own selves; is it comely that a woman pray to God uncovered?
046	1CO	011	014	Doth not even nature itself teach you, that if a man have long hair, it is a shame to him,
046	1CO	011	015	but that if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her? for her hair is given for a covering.
046	1CO	011	016	But if any one seemeth to be contentious, we have no such custom, nor the churches of God.
046	1CO	011	017	But I give you this charge, not praising you, because ye come together not for the better, but for the worse.
046	1CO	011	018	For in the first place, when ye come together in assembly of the church, I hear that there are divisions among you; and I partly believe it;
046	1CO	011	019	for there must be also parties among you, that they who are approved may also become manifest among you.
046	1CO	011	020	When ye come together then in the same place, there is no eating of the Lord's supper.
046	1CO	011	021	For, when ye eat, every one taketh before any distribution his own supper, and one is hungry, and another is drunken.
046	1CO	011	022	What! have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? Or despise ye the church of God, and shame those who have nothing? What am I to say to you? Shall I praise you? In this I do not praise you.
046	1CO	011	023	For I received of the Lord, what I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus, the same night in which he was betrayed, took a loaf,
046	1CO	011	024	and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, This is my body, which is for you; this do in remembrance of me.
046	1CO	011	025	In like manner also the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new covenant, in my blood; this do, as oft as ye drink, in remembrance of me.
046	1CO	011	026	For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink the cup, ye show forth the Lord's death, till he come.
046	1CO	011	027	So that whoever eateth the bread or drinketh the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty with respect to the body and the blood of the Lord.
046	1CO	011	028	But let a man examine himself, and thus let him eat of the bread, and drink of the cup;
046	1CO	011	029	for he that eateth and drinketh eateth and drinketh judgment to himself, if he do not discern the body.
046	1CO	011	030	For this cause many among you are weak and sickly, and some are falling asleep.
046	1CO	011	031	But if we judged ourselves, we should not be judged;
046	1CO	011	032	but when we are judged, we are chastened by the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.
046	1CO	011	033	Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, wait for one another.
046	1CO	011	034	If any one hunger, let him eat at home; that ye may not come together to condemnation. And the rest I will set in order when I come.
046	1CO	012	001	Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant.
046	1CO	012	002	Ye know, that when ye were gentiles, ye were carried away to dumb idols, as ye happened to be led;
046	1CO	012	003	wherefore I give you to understand that no one speaking by the Spirit of God saith, Accursed be Jesus; and that no one can say, Jesus is Lord, but by the Holy Spirit.
046	1CO	012	004	Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit;
046	1CO	012	005	and there are diversities of services, but the same Lord;
046	1CO	012	006	and there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God who worketh all things in all.
046	1CO	012	007	But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to each one for the good of others.
046	1CO	012	008	For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit;
046	1CO	012	009	to another faith, by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing, by the one Spirit;
046	1CO	012	010	to another the working of miracles, to another prophecy, to another discerning of spirits, to another divers kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues.
046	1CO	012	011	But all these worketh the one and self-same Spirit, allotting to each one severally as it will.
046	1CO	012	012	For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so it is with Christ.
046	1CO	012	013	For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or freemen; and were all made to drink one Spirit.
046	1CO	012	014	For the body also is not one member, but many.
046	1CO	012	015	If the foot say, Because I am not a hand, I am not of the body, is it for this reason not of the body?
046	1CO	012	016	And if the ear say, Because I am not an eye, I am not of the body, is it for this reason not of the body?
046	1CO	012	017	If the whole body were an eye, where would be the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where would be the smelling?
046	1CO	012	018	But as it is, God set the members every one of them in the body, as it pleased him.
046	1CO	012	019	And if they were all one member, where would be the body?
046	1CO	012	020	But now there are, indeed, many members, but one body.
046	1CO	012	021	And the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of thee; nor, again, the head to the feet, I have no need of you.
046	1CO	012	022	Nay, still more, those members of the body which seem to be weak, are necessary;
046	1CO	012	023	and what we think to be less honorable parts of the body, upon these we bestow more abundant honor; and our unseemly parts have more abundant seemliness;
046	1CO	012	024	while our seemly parts have no need. But God so put the body together, as to give special honor to that part which lacked,
046	1CO	012	025	that there might be no schism in the body, but that the members should have the same care one for another.
046	1CO	012	026	And so if one member suffereth, all the members suffer with it; or if one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.
046	1CO	012	027	Now ye are the body of Christ, and members individually. And
046	1CO	012	028	God appointed some in the church to be, in the first place, apostles, in the second place, prophets, in the third place, teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healing, those of helping and of governing, divers kinds of tongues. Are all apostles?
046	1CO	012	029	Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Are all workers of miracles?
046	1CO	012	030	Have all the gifts of healing? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret?
046	1CO	012	031	But desire earnestly the greater gifts. And furthermore I show you by far the most excellent way.
046	1CO	013	001	Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not love, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.
046	1CO	013	002	And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and though I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, and have not love, I am nothing.
046	1CO	013	003	And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give up my body that I may be burned, and have not love, it profiteth me nothing.
046	1CO	013	004	Love suffereth long, is kind; love envieth not; love vaunteth not herself, is not puffed up,
046	1CO	013	005	doth not behave herself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, maketh no account of an injury,
046	1CO	013	006	rejoiceth not at iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth,
046	1CO	013	007	beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.
046	1CO	013	008	Love never faileth; but whether there are prophesyings, they will come to an end; whether tongues, they will cease; whether knowledge, it will be done away.
046	1CO	013	009	For we know in part, and we prophesy in part;
046	1CO	013	010	but when that which is perfect is come, that which is in part will be done away.
046	1CO	013	011	When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I had the feelings of a child, I thought as a child; since I have become a man, I have put away the things of the child.
046	1CO	013	012	For now we see in a mirror, obscurely; but then face to face; now I know in part, but then I shall fully know even as I also am fully known.
046	1CO	013	013	And now there abide faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of these is love.
046	1CO	014	001	Strive to possess love; and desire earnestly the spiritual gifts, but especially that of prophesying.
046	1CO	014	002	For he that speaketh in an [[unknown]] tongue speaketh not to men, but to God; for no one heareth; but in the Spirit he speaketh mysteries;
046	1CO	014	003	but he that prophesieth speaketh to men edification, and exhortation, and comfort.
046	1CO	014	004	He that speaketh in an [[unknown]] tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church.
046	1CO	014	005	I would that ye all spoke with tongues, but rather that ye prophesied; for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, unless he interpret, that the church may receive edification.
046	1CO	014	006	But now, brethren, if I come to you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, unless I speak to you either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by teaching?
046	1CO	014	007	And even things without life that give sound, whether pipe or harp, if they make no distinction in the sounds, how shall that be known which is piped or harped?
046	1CO	014	008	For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who will prepare himself for the battle?
046	1CO	014	009	So also ye, unless ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall that be known which is spoken? For ye will be speaking into the air.
046	1CO	014	010	There are, it may be, so many kinds of languages in the world, and not one is without meaning.
046	1CO	014	011	If then I know not the meaning of the language, I shall be to him that speaketh a foreigner, and he that speaketh a foreigner to me.
046	1CO	014	012	So also ye, since ye are eager to possess spiritual gifts, be earnest to abound in them to the edification of the church.
046	1CO	014	013	Wherefore let him that speaketh in an [[unknown]] tongue pray that he may interpret.
046	1CO	014	014	For if I pray in an [[unknown]] tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful.
046	1CO	014	015	How stands it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also; I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.
046	1CO	014	016	Else, if thou bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupieth the place of the unlearned say the Amen at thy giving of thanks, since he understandeth not what thou art saying?
046	1CO	014	017	For thou indeed givest thanks well; but the other is not edified.
046	1CO	014	018	I thank God, I speak in an [[unknown]] tongue more than ye all;
046	1CO	014	019	yet in the church I would rather speak five words with my understanding, that I might also instruct others, than ten thousand words in an [[unknown]] tongue.
046	1CO	014	020	Brethren, do not become children in understanding; yet in malice be children, but in understanding be men.
046	1CO	014	021	In the Law it is written: “With men of other tongues and with other lips will I speak to this people,
046	1CO	014	022	and yet for all that will they not hear me, saith the Lord.” Wherefore the tongues are for a sign, not to believers, but to unbelievers; but prophesying is not for unbelievers, but for believers.
046	1CO	014	023	If therefore the whole church be assembled in one place, and all be speaking with tongues, and there come in those who are unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that ye are mad?
046	1CO	014	024	But if all prophesy, and there come in one that is an unbeliever, or unlearned, he is convinced by all, he is searched through by all,
046	1CO	014	025	the secrets of his heart become manifest; and so falling down on his face, he will worship God, and report that God is indeed within you.
046	1CO	014	026	How is it then, brethren? When ye come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a lesson of instruction, hath a revelation, hath a tongue, hath an interpretation; let all things be done for edification.
046	1CO	014	027	If any one speak in an [[unknown]] tongue, let it be by two, or, at the most, by three, and in turn; and let one interpret.
046	1CO	014	028	But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God.
046	1CO	014	029	And of the prophets let two or three speak, and let the others judge;
046	1CO	014	030	if anything be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first speaker be silent.
046	1CO	014	031	For one by one ye can all prophesy, that all may learn, and all may be exhorted.
046	1CO	014	032	And spirits of prophets are subject to prophets;
046	1CO	014	033	for God is not a God of confusion, but of peace. As in all the churches of the saints,
046	1CO	014	034	let your women keep silence in the churches; for it is not permitted them to speak, but they are to be in subjection, as also saith the Law.
046	1CO	014	035	And if they desire to learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home; for it is a shame for a woman to speak in the church.
046	1CO	014	036	What! Did the word of God come forth from you? Or did it come to you alone?
046	1CO	014	037	If any one thinketh himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him know surely that the directions I am writing to you are the Lord's;
046	1CO	014	038	but if any one be ignorant, let him be ignorant!
046	1CO	014	039	Wherefore, brethren, desire earnestly to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues;
046	1CO	014	040	but let all things be done becomingly, and in order.
046	1CO	015	001	Moreover, brethren, I declare anew to you the gospel which I preached to you, which also ye received, and wherein ye stand,
046	1CO	015	002	by which also ye are saved, if ye hold fast the same word which I preached to you, unless ye believed in vain.
046	1CO	015	003	For I delivered to you first of all what I also received, that Christ died for our sins, according to the Scriptures;
046	1CO	015	004	and that he was buried, and that he hath risen on the third day, according to the Scriptures;
046	1CO	015	005	and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve.
046	1CO	015	006	After that, he appeared to more than five hundred brethren at once, of whom the greater part remain until now, but some have fallen asleep.
046	1CO	015	007	After that, he appeared to James; then to all the apostles.
046	1CO	015	008	And last of all, as to one born out of due time, he appeared also to me.
046	1CO	015	009	For I am the least of the apostles, one not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.
046	1CO	015	010	But by the grace of God I am what I am; and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain, but I labored more abundantly than they all; yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.
046	1CO	015	011	Whether, then, it were I or they, thus we preach, and thus ye believed.
046	1CO	015	012	But if Christ be preached that he hath risen from the dead, how is it that some among you say, that there is no resurrection of the dead?
046	1CO	015	013	But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then Christ hath not risen;
046	1CO	015	014	and if Christ hath not risen, then is our preaching vain, and vain also is your faith.
046	1CO	015	015	And we are also found false witnesses concerning God; because we testified concerning God that he raised up Christ, whom he did not raise up, if so be that the dead rise not.
046	1CO	015	016	For if the dead rise not, then Christ hath not risen;
046	1CO	015	017	and if Christ hath not risen, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins;
046	1CO	015	018	then also they that have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.
046	1CO	015	019	If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.
046	1CO	015	020	But now hath Christ risen from the dead, the first-fruits of them that have fallen asleep.
046	1CO	015	021	For since through man came death, through man came also the resurrection of the dead.
046	1CO	015	022	For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ will all be made alive.
046	1CO	015	023	But every one in his own order; Christ the first-fruits, afterward they that are Christ's, at his coming.
046	1CO	015	024	Then will be the end, when he delivereth up the kingdom to God, the Father, when he shall have destroyed all dominion, and all authority, and power.
046	1CO	015	025	For he must reign, “till he hath put all enemies under his feet.”
046	1CO	015	026	The last enemy, death, will be destroyed;
046	1CO	015	027	for “he put all things under his feet.” But when it is said that all things have been put under him, it is manifest that he who put all things under him is excepted.
046	1CO	015	028	And when all things have been put under him, then will also the Son himself become subject to him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.
046	1CO	015	029	If it be not so, what are they doing, who are baptized for the dead? If the dead rise not at all, why are they then baptized for them?
046	1CO	015	030	Why also do we stand in peril every hour?
046	1CO	015	031	I protest, brethren, by my glorying in you which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, that I die daily.
046	1CO	015	032	If with the views of men I fought with wild beasts at Ephesus, what advantage is it to me? If the dead rise not, “let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die.”
046	1CO	015	033	Be not deceived; “evil communications corrupt good manners.”
046	1CO	015	034	Awake, as is your duty, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God; I say it to your shame.
046	1CO	015	035	But some one will say, How are the dead to rise? and with what body do they come?
046	1CO	015	036	Fool! that which thou sowest is not brought to life unless it die;
046	1CO	015	037	and what thou sowest, not the body that shall be dost thou sow, but a bare grain, of wheat perhaps, or of some of the other grains;
046	1CO	015	038	but God giveth it a body, as he willed, and to every seed its own body.
046	1CO	015	039	All flesh is not the same flesh; but there is one flesh of men, another of beasts, another of birds, another of fishes.
046	1CO	015	040	There are also heavenly bodies, and earthly bodies; but the glory of the heavenly is one, and the glory of the earthly is another.
046	1CO	015	041	There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for one star differeth from another star in glory.
046	1CO	015	042	So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption;
046	1CO	015	043	it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power;
046	1CO	015	044	it is sown an animal body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is an animal body, there is also a spiritual body.
046	1CO	015	045	Thus is it also written: “The first man Adam became a living soul;” the last Adam a life-giving spirit.
046	1CO	015	046	But the spiritual is not first, but the animal; and afterward the spiritual.
046	1CO	015	047	The first man is from the earth, earthy; the second man is from heaven.
046	1CO	015	048	As was the earthy, such are they also that are earthy; and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly;
046	1CO	015	049	and as we bore the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.
046	1CO	015	050	And this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor doth corruption inherit incorruption.
046	1CO	015	051	Behold, I tell you a mystery. We shall not all sleep; but we shall all be changed,
046	1CO	015	052	in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.
046	1CO	015	053	For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.
046	1CO	015	054	So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then will be brought to pass that which is written: “Death is swallowed up in victory.”
046	1CO	015	055	“Where, O death, is thy sting? Where, O death, is thy victory?”
046	1CO	015	056	The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the Law.
046	1CO	015	057	But thanks be to God, who giveth us the victory, through our Lord Jesus Christ.
046	1CO	015	058	Therefore, my beloved brethren, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, since ye know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.
046	1CO	016	001	Now concerning the collection for the saints, according to the directions which I gave to the churches of Galatia, so also do ye.
046	1CO	016	002	Every first day of the week let each of you lay by him something in store, according as he hath prospered; that the collections may not have to be made when I come.
046	1CO	016	003	And when I am with you, I will send with letters whomever you may approve to carry your bounty to Jerusalem;
046	1CO	016	004	and if it be worth while for me to go also, they shall go with me.
046	1CO	016	005	Now I will come to you, when I have passed through Macedonia; for I am about to pass through Macedonia;
046	1CO	016	006	and perhaps I may remain, or even spend the winter with you, that ye may set me forward on my journey whithersoever I may be going.
046	1CO	016	007	For I am unwilling to see you now in passing; for I hope to stay some time with you if the Lord permit.
046	1CO	016	008	But I shall remain at Ephesus until the Pentecost;
046	1CO	016	009	for a door hath been opened to me great and effective, and there are many adversaries.
046	1CO	016	010	Now if Timothy come, see that he be with you without fear; for he is laboring in the work of the Lord, as I am;
046	1CO	016	011	let no one therefore despise him. But conduct him on in peace, that he may come to me; for I am waiting for him with the brethren.
046	1CO	016	012	As regards Apollos, the brother, I urged him much to come to you with the brethren; and it was not at all his will to come at this time; but he will come when he hath a convenient opportunity.
046	1CO	016	013	Watch, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong;
046	1CO	016	014	let all your doings be in love.
046	1CO	016	015	And I exhort you, brethren, —ye know the family of Stephanas, that they are the first-fruits of Achaia, and that they have devoted themselves to the service of the holy, —
046	1CO	016	016	that ye submit yourselves to such as they are, and to every one that worketh with us, and laboreth.
046	1CO	016	017	I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus; for what was lacking on your part, they supplied;
046	1CO	016	018	for they refreshed my spirit and yours. Pay regard then to those that are such.
046	1CO	016	019	The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Prisca, with the church that is in their house, send you many salutations in the Lord.
046	1CO	016	020	All the brethren salute you. Salute one another with a holy kiss.
046	1CO	016	021	The salutation of me, Paul, with my own hand.
046	1CO	016	022	If any one loveth not the Lord, let him be accursed! The Lord is at hand.
046	1CO	016	023	The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you.
046	1CO	016	024	My love is with you all in Christ Jesus.

# BOOK	047	2CO	2 Corinthians	2 Corinthians
047	2CO	001	001	Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy the brother, to the church of God which is in Corinth, with all the holy who are in all Achaia:
047	2CO	001	002	Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Fathers and the Lord Jesus Christ.
047	2CO	001	003	Blessed be God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort,
047	2CO	001	004	who comforteth us in all our distress, that we may be able to comfort those who are in any distress by the comfort wherewith we are ourselves comforted by God;
047	2CO	001	005	for as the sufferings of Christ overflow to us, so through Christ doth our comfort also overflow.
047	2CO	001	006	And whether we are distressed, it is for your comfort and salvation, which showeth its power in enabling you to bear patiently the same sufferings which we also endure; and our hope is steadfast in your behalf; or whether we are comforted, it is for your comfort and salvation,
047	2CO	001	007	knowing that as ye are sharers in the sufferings, so also ye will be sharers in the comfort.
047	2CO	001	008	For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our distress which came upon us in Asia, that it was exceedingly heavy upon us beyond our strength, so that we despaired even of life;
047	2CO	001	009	yea, we ourselves had within ourselves the sentence of death, that we might not trust in ourselves, but in God who raiseth the dead;
047	2CO	001	010	who delivered us from such peril of death, and is delivering; in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us,
047	2CO	001	011	you also unitedly helping us by prayer, so that for this blessing bestowed on us by means of many, thanks may be given by many on your behalf.
047	2CO	001	012	For our glorying is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and the sincerity which is of God, not in fleshly wisdom, but in the grace of God, we have conducted ourselves in the world, and especially toward you.
047	2CO	001	013	For we write no other things to you, than what ye read or even acknowledge. And I trust ye will acknowledge even to the end,
047	2CO	001	014	as also ye have acknowledged us in part, that we are your glorying, as ye also are ours in the day of the Lord Jesus.
047	2CO	001	015	And in this confidence it was my purpose to come to you before, that ye might receive a second benefit;
047	2CO	001	016	and to go by way of you into Macedonia, and from Macedonia to come again to you, and by you to be forwarded on my way to Judaea.
047	2CO	001	017	Having, then, this purpose, did I act with levity? Or in my purposes do I resolve according to the flesh, that with me there should be now yea, yea, and now nay, nay?
047	2CO	001	018	But as God is faithful, our word to you is not yea and nay.
047	2CO	001	019	For the Son of God, Christ Jesus, who was preached among you by us, by me and Silvanus and Timothy, was not found yea and nay, but in him hath been found yea.
047	2CO	001	020	For as to all the promises of God, in him is yea, and in him amen, to the glory of God through us.
047	2CO	001	021	Now he who maketh us with you steadfast in Christ, and anointed us, is God;
047	2CO	001	022	he who also sealed us, and gave the Spirit as a pledge in our hearts.
047	2CO	001	023	But I call upon God as a witness against my soul, that it was to spare you that I came no more to Corinth;
047	2CO	001	024	not that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy. For in respect to faith ye stand firm.
047	2CO	002	001	But I determined this with myself, that my next visit to you should not be in sorrow.
047	2CO	002	002	For if I make you sorrowful, who is there to make me glad but he that is made sorrowful by me?
047	2CO	002	003	And I wrote about this very matter, that I might not on my coming have sorrow from those who ought to gladden me, having confidence in all of you, that my joy is the joy of you all.
047	2CO	002	004	For out of much distress and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears, not that ye should be made sorrowful, but that ye might know the exceeding love which I have for you.
047	2CO	002	005	But if any one hath caused grief, he hath caused it not to me alone, but in a measure, not to be too severe on him, to all of you.
047	2CO	002	006	Sufficient for such a one is this punishment, which was inflicted by the many;
047	2CO	002	007	so that on the contrary ye ought rather to forgive, and console him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.
047	2CO	002	008	Wherefore I beseech you to confirm your love toward him.
047	2CO	002	009	For to this end also I wrote, that I might know by putting it to the proof, whether ye are obedient in all things.
047	2CO	002	010	But to whom ye forgive anything, I forgive also; for what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, for your sakes I forgave it in the person of Christ,
047	2CO	002	011	that Satan might not gain an advantage over us; for we are not ignorant of his devices.
047	2CO	002	012	Now when I came to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ, and a door had been opened to me by the Lord,
047	2CO	002	013	I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother; but taking my leave of them, I went forth into Macedonia.
047	2CO	002	014	But thanks be to God, who always exhibiteth us in triumph in Christ, and manifesteth through us the odor of the knowledge of him in every place.
047	2CO	002	015	For we are to God a sweet odor of Christ among those who are being saved, and those who are perishing;
047	2CO	002	016	to the latter we are the odor of death, producing death; and to the former the odor of life, producing life. And who is sufficient for these things?
047	2CO	002	017	For we are not as the many, who adulterate the word of God; but as from sincerity, but as from God, in the sight of God we speak in Christ.
047	2CO	003	001	Are we beginning again to recommend ourselves? Or do we need, like some others, letters of recommendation to you, or letters of recommendation from you?
047	2CO	003	002	Ye are our letter, written in our hearts, known and read by all men;
047	2CO	003	003	since ye are manifestly shown to be a letter of Christ by means of our service, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not on tablets of stone, but on fleshly tablets of the heart.
047	2CO	003	004	And such confidence as this have we through Christ toward God;
047	2CO	003	005	not that we are able of ourselves to think anything, as from ourselves; but our ability is from God;
047	2CO	003	006	who also gave us ability to be ministers of a new covenant, not of the letter, but of the Spirit; for the letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth life.
047	2CO	003	007	But if the ministration of death, engraven in letters on stones, was so glorious, that the children of Israel could not look steadfastly on the face of Moses by reason of the glory of his countenance, which glory was to be done away,
047	2CO	003	008	shall not the ministration of the Spirit be much more glorious?
047	2CO	003	009	For if the ministration of condemnation had glory, much greater is the glory of the ministration of righteousness.
047	2CO	003	010	For even that which was made glorious hath ceased to be glorious in this respect, by reason of the glory by which it is exceeded.
047	2CO	003	011	For if that which was to be done away was glorious, much more glorious is that which endureth.
047	2CO	003	012	Having therefore such hope, we use great plainness of speech;
047	2CO	003	013	and do not as Moses did, who put a veil over his face, that the children of Israel might not steadfastly look on the end of that which was to be done away.
047	2CO	003	014	But their understandings were blinded; for until this day, when the old covenant is read, the same veil remaineth, since it is not unveiled to them that it is done away in Christ;
047	2CO	003	015	but even till this day, when Moses is read, there lieth a veil upon their heart;
047	2CO	003	016	but whenever it turneth to the Lord, the veil is taken away.
047	2CO	003	017	Now the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.
047	2CO	003	018	But we all with unveiled face beholding in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, as by the Lord, the Spirit.
047	2CO	004	001	Therefore, having this ministry through the mercy we received, we are not faint-hearted;
047	2CO	004	002	but have renounced the hidden things of shame, not walking in craftiness, nor adulterating the word of God, but by the manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.
047	2CO	004	003	But if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to them that perish,
047	2CO	004	004	in whom the God of this world blinded the understandings of the unbelieving, so that they cannot behold the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.
047	2CO	004	005	For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves your bond-servants for Jesus' sake.
047	2CO	004	006	For it is God, who commanded light to shine out of darkness, that shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ.
047	2CO	004	007	But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the exceeding greatness of the power may be of God, and not of us;
047	2CO	004	008	being troubled on every side, yet not distressed; perplexed, but not in despair;
047	2CO	004	009	persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;
047	2CO	004	010	always bearing about in the body the dying of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our body.
047	2CO	004	011	For we who live are continually delivered up to death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh.
047	2CO	004	012	So then death worketh in us, but life in you.
047	2CO	004	013	But having the same spirit of faith, according to that which is written, “I believed, and therefore I spoke,” we also believe, and therefore speak;
047	2CO	004	014	knowing that he who raised up the Lord Jesus will raise up us also with Jesus, and will present us with you.
047	2CO	004	015	For all things are for your sakes, that the grace abounding by means of the greater number may cause thanksgiving to abound to the glory of God.
047	2CO	004	016	For which cause we are not faint-hearted; but though our outward man is perishing, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.
047	2CO	004	017	For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh out for us, in a higher and still higher degree, an everlasting weight of glory;
047	2CO	004	018	while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen; for the things which are seen are but for a time; but the things which are not seen are ever lasting.
047	2CO	005	001	For we know that, if our earthly tent-habitation be destroyed, we have a building provided by God, a house not made with hands, everlasting, in the heavens.
047	2CO	005	002	For while in this we groan, longing to be clothed upon with our habitation which is from heaven;
047	2CO	005	003	since, indeed, when we have put off our present garment, we shall not be found naked.
047	2CO	005	004	For we who are in this tent groan, being burdened; inasmuch as we do not desire to be unclothed, but to be clothed upon, that mortality may be swallowed up by life.
047	2CO	005	005	Now he that hath prepared us for this very thing is God; who also gave to us the Spirit as the pledge.
047	2CO	005	006	We have courage, therefore, always, and know that while we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord;
047	2CO	005	007	for we walk by faith, not by sight; but we have courage,
047	2CO	005	008	and are well pleased rather to be absent from the body, and to be at home with the Lord.
047	2CO	005	009	Wherefore we also strive that, whether at home or absent, we may be approved by him.
047	2CO	005	010	For we must all be made manifest before the judgment-seat of Christ, that each one may receive the things done in his body, according to what he did, whether good or bad.
047	2CO	005	011	Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord, we persuade men; but to God we have been made manifest, and I hope have been made manifest in your consciences also.
047	2CO	005	012	For we are not again commending ourselves to you, but giving you occasion to glory on our behalf; that ye may have somewhat to answer those who glory in outward appearance, and not in heart.
047	2CO	005	013	For whether we were beside ourselves, it was for God; or whether we are in our sound mind, it is for you.
047	2CO	005	014	For the love of Christ constraineth us, because we thus judged, that if one died for all, then all died;
047	2CO	005	015	and he died for all, that they who live should no longer live to themselves, but to him who died for their sakes, and rose again.
047	2CO	005	016	So that we henceforth know no one according to the flesh; and if we have even known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we no longer know him.
047	2CO	005	017	Therefore, if any one is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new.
047	2CO	005	018	And all things are from God, who reconciled us to himself by Christ, and gave to us the ministry of reconciliation;
047	2CO	005	019	seeing that in Christ God was reconciling the world to himself, not reckoning to them their trespasses, and having committed to us the word of reconciliation.
047	2CO	005	020	We then are ambassadors for Christ; as though God were exhorting you by us, in behalf of Christ we entreat you, Be reconciled to God.
047	2CO	005	021	Him, who knew not sin, he made sin for us, that we might become God's righteousness in him.
047	2CO	006	001	As fellow-workers, then, with him, we also exhort you that ye receive not the grace of God in vain;
047	2CO	006	002	(for he saith: “In an accepted time I heard thee, and in the day of salvation I helped thee;” Behold, now is the accepted time, behold, now is the day of salvation; )
047	2CO	006	003	giving no occasion for stumbling in anything, that the ministry may not be blamed;
047	2CO	006	004	but as God's ministers recommending ourselves in all things, in much endurance, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,
047	2CO	006	005	in stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in watchings, in fastings;
047	2CO	006	006	in pureness, in knowledge, in long-suffering, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in love unfeigned,
047	2CO	006	007	in the word of truth, in the power of God, by the weapons of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,
047	2CO	006	008	through honor and dishonor, through evil report and good report; as deceivers, and true;
047	2CO	006	009	as unknown, and well known; as dying, and behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed;
047	2CO	006	010	as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and possessing all things.
047	2CO	006	011	Our mouth is open to you, O Corinthians, our heart is enlarged.
047	2CO	006	012	Ye have not a narrow place in my heart, but ye have a narrow place for me in yours.
047	2CO	006	013	So then in return, I speak to you as children, let your hearts be enlarged.
047	2CO	006	014	Be not strangely yoked with unbelievers; for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? Or what communion hath light with darkness?
047	2CO	006	015	And what concord hath Christ with Beliar? Or what part hath a believer with an unbeliever?
047	2CO	006	016	And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? For ye are the temple of the living God; as God said: “I will dwell among them, and walk among them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.”
047	2CO	006	017	“Wherefore come out from the midst of them, and be separated, saith the Lord, and touch not anything unclean;” “and I will receive you,
047	2CO	006	018	and will be to you a father, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.”
047	2CO	007	001	Having then these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all pollution of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.
047	2CO	007	002	Receive us into your hearts; we have wronged no one, we have corrupted no one, we have defrauded no one.
047	2CO	007	003	I am not saying this to condemn you; for I have said before, that ye are in our hearts to die with you and to live with you.
047	2CO	007	004	Great is my confidence toward you, great is my glorying on your account; I am filled with comfort, I overflow with joy in all our trouble.
047	2CO	007	005	For indeed when we had come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side; without were fightings, within were fears.
047	2CO	007	006	But God, that comforteth those who are brought low, comforted us by the coming of Titus;
047	2CO	007	007	and not by his coming only, but by the comfort with which he was comforted in regard to you, when he told us of your earnest desire, your mourning, your zeal in my behalf; so that I rejoiced the more.
047	2CO	007	008	For though I caused you sorrow with the letter, I do not regret it, though I did regret it; for I perceive that that letter caused you sorrow, though it was but for a short time.
047	2CO	007	009	Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorrowful, but that your sorrow produced repentance. For the sorrow which ye felt had respect to God, that ye might in nothing receive injury from me.
047	2CO	007	010	For sorrow before God worketh repentance to salvation never to be regretted; but the sorrow of the world worketh death.
047	2CO	007	011	For behold this very thing, that your sorrow had respect to God; what earnestness it wrought in you; yea, what clearing of yourselves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what longing desire, yea, what zeal, yea, what readiness to punish! In every thing ye showed yourselves to be pure in the matter.
047	2CO	007	012	Although, then, I wrote to you, it was not on account of him that did the wrong, nor of him who suffered wrong; but that your earnestness for us might be made manifest to you in the sight of God.
047	2CO	007	013	Therefore we have been comforted; but in our comfort we rejoiced still more on account of the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by you all;
047	2CO	007	014	for if in anything I have boasted to him of you, I am not put to shame; but as we spoke all things to you in truth, so also our boasting, which we made before Titus, was found to be truth;
047	2CO	007	015	and his affection is more abundant toward you, while he remembers the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye received him.
047	2CO	007	016	I rejoice that in every thing I have confidence in you.
047	2CO	008	001	Moreover, brethren, we make known to you the grace of God which hath been bestowed in the churches of Macedonia;
047	2CO	008	002	that under a great trial of distress the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty increased the riches of their liberality;
047	2CO	008	003	for according to their power, I bear witness, and beyond their power, they gave of their own accord,
047	2CO	008	004	begging of us with much entreaty the favor of sharing in the ministration to the saints;
047	2CO	008	005	and this, not as we expected, but they gave themselves first to the Lord and to us by the will of God;
047	2CO	008	006	so that we urged Titus, that, as he had already made a beginning, so he would also finish among you this bounty also.
047	2CO	008	007	But as ye abound in every thing, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and all earnestness, and in your love to us, see that ye abound in this exercise of liberality also.
047	2CO	008	008	I speak not by way of command, but by reason of the earnestness of others, and to prove the genuineness of your love.
047	2CO	008	009	For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.
047	2CO	008	010	And I only give an opinion in this matter. For this is expedient for you, who began before others, not only to do, but also to be willing, a year ago.
047	2CO	008	011	Now therefore perform the doing of it, that as there was a readiness to will, so there may be a performance also out of that which ye have.
047	2CO	008	012	For if there be first the willing mind, it is accepted according to what a man hath, not according to what he hath not.
047	2CO	008	013	For it is not that others may be eased, and you burdened,
047	2CO	008	014	but to make an equality; at the present season your abundance meeting their deficiency, that their abundance may at another time meet your deficiency; that there may be equality;
047	2CO	008	015	as it is written: “He that gathered much, had nothing over; and he that gathered little, had no lack.”
047	2CO	008	016	But thanks be to God, who put the same earnest care for you into the heart of Titus;
047	2CO	008	017	for he accepted indeed the exhortation; but being very earnest, he went of his own accord to you.
047	2CO	008	018	And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise in the gospel is throughout all the churches;
047	2CO	008	019	and not that only, but who was also appointed by the churches as our fellow-traveler in the matter of this bounty, which is administered by us to the honor of the Lord himself, and of our ready mind;
047	2CO	008	020	since we are careful of this, that no one should blame us in our management of this abundant liberality;
047	2CO	008	021	for we take forethought for what is honorable, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.
047	2CO	008	022	And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have often in many things proved to be zealous, but now much more zealous through the great confidence which he hath in you.
047	2CO	008	023	As to Titus, he is my partner and fellow-laborer for you; as to our brethren, they are messengers of the churches, the glory of Christ.
047	2CO	008	024	Display to them, therefore, before the churches, the proof of your love, and of what we have boasted on your behalf.
047	2CO	009	001	For concerning the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you.
047	2CO	009	002	For I know your readiness of mind, of which I boast in behalf of you to the Macedonians, that Achaia was prepared a year ago; and your zeal stirred up the greater part of them.
047	2CO	009	003	But I sent the brethren, that our boasting of you should not prove unfounded in this respect; that, as I said, ye may be prepared;
047	2CO	009	004	lest, should the Macedonians come with me, and find you unprepared, we (not to say ye) should be put to shame in respect to this confidence.
047	2CO	009	005	I thought it necessary therefore to exhort the brethren to go before to you, and make up beforehand your bounty, which was already announced, that the same might be ready, as a matter of bounty, and not of covetousness.
047	2CO	009	006	But this there is to say: He that soweth sparingly, shall reap also sparingly; and he that soweth bountifully, shall reap also bountifully.
047	2CO	009	007	Each one, as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity; for God loveth a cheerful giver.
047	2CO	009	008	And God is able to make every blessing abound toward you, that ye, always having all sufficiency in everything, may abound to every good work;
047	2CO	009	009	as it is written: “He dispersed abroad, he gave to the poor; his righteousness remaineth for ever.”
047	2CO	009	010	Now, he that ministereth seed to the sower, and bread for food, will supply and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;
047	2CO	009	011	while ye are enriched in everything to all liberality, which worketh out through us thanksgiving to God;
047	2CO	009	012	for the ministration of this service not only supplieth the wants of the saints, but also overfloweth through many thanksgivings to God;
047	2CO	009	013	while by the proof afforded by this ministration they glorify God for your obedience to your profession in regard to the gospel of Christ, and for the liberality of your contribution in regard to them and in regard to all;
047	2CO	009	014	while with supplication for you they long after you on account of the exceeding grace of God to you.
047	2CO	009	015	Thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift.
047	2CO	010	001	Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, I, who present indeed am lowly among you, but am bold toward you when absent;
047	2CO	010	002	but I entreat you, that I may not when I am present be bold with that confidence wherewith I think of being bold towards some, who think of us as walking according to the flesh.
047	2CO	010	003	For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh,
047	2CO	010	004	(for the weapons of our warfare are not fleshly, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds, )
047	2CO	010	005	casting down reasonings, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing every purpose into captivity to the obedience of Christ,
047	2CO	010	006	and being in readiness to punish every disobedience, when the measure of your obedience shall be full.
047	2CO	010	007	Ye look at the outward appearance. If any one trusteth to himself that he belongeth to Christ, let him of himself consider this again, that as he belongeth to Christ, so also do we.
047	2CO	010	008	For even if I should boast still more highly of our authority, which the Lord gave us for building you up, and not pulling you down, I should not be put to shame;
047	2CO	010	009	that I may not seem as if I would terrify you by my letters.
047	2CO	010	010	For his letters, saith one, are weighty and strong; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible.
047	2CO	010	011	Let such a one count upon this, that such as we are in word by letters when absent, such will we be also in deed when present.
047	2CO	010	012	For we do not venture to reckon ourselves among, or compare ourselves with, some of those who commend themselves; but they, measuring themselves among themselves, and comparing themselves with themselves, are not wise.
047	2CO	010	013	But we will not boast of things that are without our measure, but according to the measure of the line which God allotted us, —a measure to reach even to you.
047	2CO	010	014	For we do not stretch ourselves beyond our measure, as though we reached not to you; (for as far as even to you did we come, in the gospel of Christ; )
047	2CO	010	015	not boasting of things that are without measure, in other men's labors, but having hope, when your faith is increased, that our line will through you be still further extended,
047	2CO	010	016	so that we may preach the gospel in the regions beyond you; not boasting, in another's line, of things made ready to our hand.
047	2CO	010	017	But “he that boasteth, let him boast in the Lord.”
047	2CO	010	018	For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but he whom the Lord commendeth.
047	2CO	011	001	Would that ye could bear with me in a little folly! and indeed ye do bear with me.
047	2CO	011	002	For I am jealous over you with a godly jealousy; for I espoused you to one husband, to present you as a pure virgin to Christ;
047	2CO	011	003	but I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve by his subtlety, so your minds should be corrupted from single-heartedness toward Christ.
047	2CO	011	004	For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we did not preach, or if ye receive another spirit, which ye did not receive, or another gospel, which ye did not accept, well might ye bear with it.
047	2CO	011	005	For I suppose that I am in no respect behind the very foremost apostles.
047	2CO	011	006	And though I am rude in speech, yet I am not in knowledge; but this did we in every respect manifest to you in all things.
047	2CO	011	007	Did I commit an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I preached to you the gospel of God without charge?
047	2CO	011	008	I robbed other churches, taking wages of them, in order to do you service;
047	2CO	011	009	and when I was present with you, and in want, I was a charge to no one; (for the brethren, when they came from Macedonia, supplied my wants; ) and in every thing I kept myself and will keep myself from being burdensome to you.
047	2CO	011	010	As the truth of Christ is in me, this boasting shall not be stopped in regard to me in the regions of Achaia.
047	2CO	011	011	Wherefore? Because I love you not? God knoweth!
047	2CO	011	012	But what I do, that I will continue to do, that I may cut off occasion from those who wish for an occasion, in order that in the matter of which they boast they may be found even as we.
047	2CO	011	013	For such are false apostles, deceitful workmen, transforming themselves into apostles of Christ.
047	2CO	011	014	And no wonder; for even Satan transformeth himself into an angel of light.
047	2CO	011	015	It is no great thing, then, if his ministers also transform themselves as ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.
047	2CO	011	016	I say again, let no one suppose me a fool; if otherwise, yet even as a fool receive me, that I too may boast myself a little.
047	2CO	011	017	What I speak, I speak not after the Lord, but as it were in folly, in this confidence of boasting.
047	2CO	011	018	Seeing that many boast after the flesh, I will boast also.
047	2CO	011	019	For ye bear with fools gladly, seeing ye yourselves are wise;
047	2CO	011	020	for ye bear with it, if one brings you into bondage, if one devours you, if one takes from you, if one exalts himself, if one smites you on the face.
047	2CO	011	021	I say it to my reproach, that we were weak; but in whatever any one is bold, (I speak in folly, ) I am bold also.
047	2CO	011	022	Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they Abram's offspring? So am I.
047	2CO	011	023	Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as beside myself, ) I am more; in labors more abundantly, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequently, in deaths often;
047	2CO	011	024	of the Jews five times I received forty stripes save one;
047	2CO	011	025	thrice I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have spent in the deep;
047	2CO	011	026	by journeyings often; by perils of rivers, by perils of robbers, by perils from my countrymen, by perils from the heathen, by perils in the city, by perils in the wilderness, by perils in the sea, by perils among false brethren;
047	2CO	011	027	by weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.
047	2CO	011	028	Besides the other troubles, there is that which presseth upon me daily, the anxiety for all the churches.
047	2CO	011	029	Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is in danger of stumbling, and I do not burn?
047	2CO	011	030	If I must boast, I will boast of the things which belong to my weakness.
047	2CO	011	031	The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, who is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I am not lying.
047	2CO	011	032	In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept guard over the city of the Damascenes, in order to apprehend me;
047	2CO	011	033	and through a window I was let down in a basket by the wall, and escaped his hands.
047	2CO	012	001	It is indeed not expedient for me to boast; I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.
047	2CO	012	002	I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago, —whether in the body, I know not, or whether out of the body, I know not; God knoweth, —such a one caught up even to the third heaven.
047	2CO	012	003	And I know such a man, whether in the body, or without the body, I know not; God knoweth, —
047	2CO	012	004	that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.
047	2CO	012	005	Of such a one I will boast; but of myself I will not boast, except in my infirmities.
047	2CO	012	006	For if I should desire to boast, I should not be a fool; for I should say the truth; but I forbear, lest any one should think of me above what he seeth me to be, or what he heareth from me.
047	2CO	012	007	And that I might not be too much lifted up by the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan, to buffet me, that I might not be too much lifted up.
047	2CO	012	008	In respect to this I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me;
047	2CO	012	009	and he said to me, My grace is sufficient for thee; for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather boast in my weaknesses, that the strength of Christ may abide upon me.
047	2CO	012	010	Therefore I take pleasure in weaknesses, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses in behalf of Christ; for when I am weak, then am I strong.
047	2CO	012	011	I have become a fool; it is ye that compelled me. For I ought to have been commended by you; for in nothing was I behind the very foremost apostles, though I am nothing.
047	2CO	012	012	Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you with all endurance, by signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.
047	2CO	012	013	For what is there in which ye were at disadvantage when compared with other churches, except that I myself was not a charge to you? Forgive me this wrong.
047	2CO	012	014	Behold, I am ready to come to you this third time, and I will not be a charge to you; for I seek not yours, but you. For the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.
047	2CO	012	015	And I will very gladly spend and be spent for your souls; though the more I love you, the less I am loved.
047	2CO	012	016	But be it so; I at least was not a charge to you; but yet, being crafty, I caught you with guile.
047	2CO	012	017	Did I make gain of you by any of those whom I have sent to you?
047	2CO	012	018	I urged Titus to go to you, and with him I sent the brother. Did Titus make a gain of you? Did we not walk in the same spirit? Did we not walk in the same steps?
047	2CO	012	019	Have ye been thinking this long time that we are defending ourselves to you? It is before God in Christ that we are speaking; but all things, beloved, for your edification.
047	2CO	012	020	For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and lest I too shall be found by you such as ye would not; lest there be wranglings, envying, wraths, rivalries, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults;
047	2CO	012	021	and lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and that I shall bewail many of those who have sinned already, and did not repent of the uncleanness, and fornication, and lasciviousness, which they committed.
047	2CO	013	001	This is the third time I am coming to you. In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established.
047	2CO	013	002	I said before, and now say beforehand, as when present the second time, so also absent now, to those who have sinned before, and to all the others, that if I come again, I will not spare;
047	2CO	013	003	since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, who towards you is not weak, but is mighty among you.
047	2CO	013	004	For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth through the power of God; for we also are weak in him, but we shall live together with him by the power of God toward you.
047	2CO	013	005	Try yourselves, whether ye are in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, that Christ Jesus is in you, unless ye are unapproved?
047	2CO	013	006	But I trust that ye shall know, that we are not unapproved.
047	2CO	013	007	Now we pray to God that ye do no evil; not in order that we may appear approved, but that ye may do what is good, though we be as unapproved.
047	2CO	013	008	For we have no power against the truth, but for the truth.
047	2CO	013	009	For we are glad, when we are weak, and ye are strong; this also we pray for, even your perfection.
047	2CO	013	010	For this cause I write these things while absent, that when present I may not use sharpness, according to the power which the Lord gave me for edification, and not for destruction.
047	2CO	013	011	Finally, brethren, farewell! Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you.
047	2CO	013	012	Salute one another with a holy kiss.
047	2CO	013	013	All the saints salute you.
047	2CO	013	014	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the partaking of the Holy Spirit, be with you all.

# BOOK	048	GAL	Galatians	Galatians
048	GAL	001	001	Paul, an apostle, not from men, nor through man, but through Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead, —
048	GAL	001	002	and all the brethren that are with me, to the churches of Galatia:
048	GAL	001	003	Grace be to you and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ,
048	GAL	001	004	who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from the present evil world, according to the will of God our Father;
048	GAL	001	005	to whom be the glory for ever and ever! Amen.
048	GAL	001	006	I marvel that ye are so soon turning from him that called you in the grace of Christ, to a different gospel;
048	GAL	001	007	which is not another; only there are certain persons who are troubling you, and seeking to change entirely the gospel of Christ.
048	GAL	001	008	But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel to you contrary to that which we preached to you, let him be accursed!
048	GAL	001	009	As we have said before, so I now say again, If any one preach a gospel to you contrary to that which ye received, let him be accursed!
048	GAL	001	010	For do I now seek the favor of men, or of God? Or am I endeavoring to please men? If I were still pleasing men, I should not be the servant of Christ.
048	GAL	001	011	But I assure you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not after man;
048	GAL	001	012	for I did not receive it from man nor was I taught it by any man, but it was revealed to me by Jesus Christ.
048	GAL	001	013	For ye have heard of my conduct formerly in Judaism; that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and was destroying it,
048	GAL	001	014	and made progress in Judaism beyond many of the same age with me in my nation, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.
048	GAL	001	015	But when it pleased him who set me apart from my very birth, and called me through his grace,
048	GAL	001	016	to reveal his Son within me, that I might publish the glad tidings of him among the gentiles, immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood,
048	GAL	001	017	neither did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away into Arabia, and returned again to Damascus.
048	GAL	001	018	Then, after three years, I went up to Jerusalem to become acquainted with Cephas, and stayed with him fifteen days;
048	GAL	001	019	but no other of the apostles did I see, save James the brother of the Lord.
048	GAL	001	020	Now as to what I am writing to you, behold, before God, I do not lie.
048	GAL	001	021	Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;
048	GAL	001	022	and I was unknown by face to the churches of Judaea which were in Christ;
048	GAL	001	023	but they were only hearing that “He who was once our persecutor is now preaching the faith which he was once destroying”;
048	GAL	001	024	and they glorified God in me.
048	GAL	002	001	Then, fourteen years after, I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus also with me.
048	GAL	002	002	And I went up by revelation, and communicated to them that gospel which I preach among the gentiles; but privately to those who were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.
048	GAL	002	003	But not even Titus, who was with me, though he was a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised;
048	GAL	002	004	and that because of the false brethren stealthily brought in, who crept in to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring into bondage;
048	GAL	002	005	to whom not even for an hour did we yield by the required subjection, that the truth of the gospel might still remain with you.
048	GAL	002	006	But from those who were reputed to be somewhat—whatever they were, it matters not to me, (God accepteth no man's person, ) for to me those in reputation communicated nothing new.
048	GAL	002	007	But on the contrary, when they saw that I was intrusted with the gospel to the uncircumcised, as Peter was with that to the circumcised,
048	GAL	002	008	(for he who wrought for Peter in behalf of the apostleship to the circumcised, wrought also for me in behalf of the gentiles, )
048	GAL	002	009	and when they knew the grace that was given to me, James and Cephas and John, who were reputed to be pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, that we should go to the gentiles, and they to the circumcised;
048	GAL	002	010	only they wished us to remember the poor; which very thing I also was earnest to do.
048	GAL	002	011	But when Cephas came to Antioch, I withstood him to the face; for he was condemned.
048	GAL	002	012	For before certain persons came from James, he used to eat with the gentiles; but when they came, he withdrew, and separated himself, fearing those who were of the circumcision.
048	GAL	002	013	And the other Jews also dissembled with him; so that even Barnabas was carried away with their dissimulation.
048	GAL	002	014	But when I saw that they were not walking uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas in the presence of all, If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of gentiles, and not that of the Jews, how is it that thou compellest the gentiles to keep the customs of the Jews?
048	GAL	002	015	We are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the gentiles;
048	GAL	002	016	but knowing that a man is not accepted as righteous by the works of the Law, but by faith in Christ Jesus, we also have believed in Christ Jesus, that we might be accepted as righteous by faith in Christ, and not by the works of the Law; for by the works of the Law shall no flesh be accepted as righteous.
048	GAL	002	017	But while seeking to be accepted as righteous in Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is Christ therefore a minister of sin? Far be it!
048	GAL	002	018	For if I again build up what I pulled down, I make myself a transgressor.
048	GAL	002	019	For I through the Law died to the Law, that I might live to God.
048	GAL	002	020	I have been crucified with Christ, and no longer do I live, but Christ liveth in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith in the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.
048	GAL	002	021	I do not set aside the grace of God; for if righteousness come through the Law, then did Christ die for nought.
048	GAL	003	001	O foolish Galatians, who bewitched you? before whose eyes Jesus Christ was plainly set forth among you crucified.
048	GAL	003	002	This only I desire to learn from you: Was it from the works of the Law that ye received the Spirit, or by the preaching of faith?
048	GAL	003	003	Are ye so foolish? Having begun with the Spirit, do ye now end with the flesh?
048	GAL	003	004	Have ye suffered so much in vain? if indeed it be really in vain.
048	GAL	003	005	Doth he then who is supplying to you the Spirit, and working miracles among you, do it by the works of the Law, or by the preaching of faith?
048	GAL	003	006	Even as Abraham “believed God, and it was accounted to him as righteousness.”
048	GAL	003	007	Know then that they who have faith, these are the sons of Abraham.
048	GAL	003	008	Moreover the Scripture, foreseeing that God was to accept the gentiles as righteous by faith, proclaimed beforehand the glad tidings to Abraham, saying, “In thee shall all nations be blessed.”
048	GAL	003	009	So then they who have faith are blessed with believing Abraham.
048	GAL	003	010	For as many as rely on the works of the Law are under a curse; for it is written, “Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the Law, to do them.”
048	GAL	003	011	But further, that through the observance of the Law no one is accepted as righteous with God is evident; for “the righteous shall live by faith.”
048	GAL	003	012	And the Law hath nothing to do with faith; but [[its language is]], “He that hath done them shall live in them.”
048	GAL	003	013	Christ redeemed us from the curse of the Law, having become a curse for us; for it is written, “Cursed is every one that is hanged on a beam of wood,”—
048	GAL	003	014	to the end that in Christ Jesus the blessing promised to Abraham might come to the gentiles, that we through faith might receive the Spirit which was promised.
048	GAL	003	015	Brethren, I speak according to what is practised among men; no one sets aside even a human covenant, or makes additions to it, after it has been ratified.
048	GAL	003	016	But the promises were made to Abraham and “to his offspring.” He doth not say, “and to offsprings,” as speaking of many, but, as speaking of one, “and to thy offspring,” which is Christ.
048	GAL	003	017	And what I mean is this; that a covenant that was before ratified by God, the Law, which came four hundred and thirty years after, cannot annul, so as to make void the promise;
048	GAL	003	018	for if the inheritance cometh from the Law, it ceaseth to be the consequence of the promise; but to Abraham God gave it by promise.
048	GAL	003	019	To what end then was the Law? It was added because of transgressions, till the offspring should come to whom the promise belongeth, having been ordained through angels by the hand of a mediator.
048	GAL	003	020	Now no mediator is a mediator of one; but God is one.
048	GAL	003	021	Is then the Law against the promises of God? Far be it! For if a law had been given which was able to give life, righteousness would indeed have been by the Law;
048	GAL	003	022	but the Scripture shut up all under sin, that the blessing promised through faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.
048	GAL	003	023	But before faith came, we were kept in ward under the Law, shut up unto the faith which was to be revealed.
048	GAL	003	024	So then the Law hath been our schoolmaster, to lead us to Christ, that we might be accepted as righteous through faith;
048	GAL	003	025	but faith having come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.
048	GAL	003	026	For ye are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus;
048	GAL	003	027	for as many of you as were baptized into Christ, did put on Christ.
048	GAL	003	028	There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is no male and female; for ye are all one in Christ Jesus;
048	GAL	003	029	and if ye belong to Christ, then are ye Abraham's offspring, heirs according to the promise.
048	GAL	004	001	Now I say, that the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth in no respect from a bond-servant, though he is lord of all;
048	GAL	004	002	but is under guardians and stewards, until the time appointed by the father.
048	GAL	004	003	So also we, when we were children, were in bondage under the rudiments of the world;
048	GAL	004	004	but when the fullness of the time came, God sent forth his Son, born of a woman, born under the Law,
048	GAL	004	005	to redeem those under the Law, that we might be adopted as sons.
048	GAL	004	006	And to show that ye are sons, God sent forth the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father!
048	GAL	004	007	So then thou art no longer a bond-servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir through God.
048	GAL	004	008	But at that time, indeed, when ye knew not God, ye were in slavery to those who in their nature are not gods;
048	GAL	004	009	but now, after having known God, or rather having been known by God, how is it that ye are turning back to the weak and beggarly rudiments to which ye wish to be again in bondage?
048	GAL	004	010	Do ye observe days, and months, and times, and years?
048	GAL	004	011	I fear for you, lest I may have bestowed upon you labor in vain.
048	GAL	004	012	Brethren, I beseech you, become as I am, for I also have become as ye are; ye injured me in nothing.
048	GAL	004	013	Nay, ye know that it was on account of an infirmity of the flesh that I preached the gospel to you the former time,
048	GAL	004	014	and my trial which was in my flesh ye did not despise nor spurn; but received me as an angel of God, yea, as Christ Jesus.
048	GAL	004	015	How great then was your boasting of happiness! for I bear you witness, that if possible, ye would have plucked out your eyes, and have given them to me.
048	GAL	004	016	So then, have I become your enemy because I tell you the truth?
048	GAL	004	017	They show a zeal for you, but not in honesty; yea, they wish to exclude you, that ye may be zealous for them.
048	GAL	004	018	But it is good to be an object of zeal in what is good always, and not only when I am present with you.
048	GAL	004	019	My children, with whom I am again in travail until Christ be formed in you, —
048	GAL	004	020	I could wish indeed to be present with you now, and to change my tone, for I am in perplexity about you.
048	GAL	004	021	Tell me, ye that desire to be under the Law, do ye not hear the Law?
048	GAL	004	022	For it is written, that Abraham had two sons; the one by the bondwoman, the other by the freewoman.
048	GAL	004	023	But the one by the bondwoman was born after the flesh; while the one by the freewoman was through the promise.
048	GAL	004	024	Which things are written allegorically; for these women are two covenants; the one from Mount Sinai, who beareth children into bondage, which is Hagar;
048	GAL	004	025	for the word Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia; and she corresponds to the Jerusalem now existing, for she is in bondage with her children;
048	GAL	004	026	but the Jerusalem that is above is free, and she is our mother.
048	GAL	004	027	For it is written: “Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not; for many are the children of the desolate one, rather than of her who hath the husband.”
048	GAL	004	028	But ye, brethren, as Isaac was, are children of a promise.
048	GAL	004	029	But as at that time he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born through the Spirit, so it is now.
048	GAL	004	030	But what saith the scripture? “Cast out the bondwoman and her son; for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman.”
048	GAL	004	031	So then, brethren, we are not children of a bondwoman, but of the freewoman.
048	GAL	005	001	Stand firm in the liberty with which Christ made us free, and be not again bound fast to the yoke of bondage.
048	GAL	005	002	Behold, I Paul say to you, that if ye are circumcised, Christ will profit you nothing;
048	GAL	005	003	yea, I testify again to every one who becometh circumcised, that he is bound to keep the whole Law.
048	GAL	005	004	Ye are entirely separated from Christ, who seek to obtain righteousness through the Law; ye have fallen away from grace.
048	GAL	005	005	For we through the Spirit by faith steadfastly wait for the hope of righteousness.
048	GAL	005	006	For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision; but faith working by love.
048	GAL	005	007	Ye were running well; who hindered you, that ye should not obey the truth?
048	GAL	005	008	This persuasion came not from him that called you.
048	GAL	005	009	A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.
048	GAL	005	010	I indeed have confidence in regard to you in the Lord, that ye will be no otherwise minded; but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whoever he may be.
048	GAL	005	011	But as for me, brethren, if I still preach circumcision, why do I still suffer persecution? Then hath the cross ceased to be a stumbling-block.
048	GAL	005	012	Would that they who unsettle you would quite cut themselves off!
048	GAL	005	013	For ye, brethren, were called to liberty; only use not your liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by your love serve one another.
048	GAL	005	014	For the whole Law is fulfilled in one commandment, even in this “Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.”
048	GAL	005	015	But if ye bite and devour one another, beware lest ye be consumed by one another.
048	GAL	005	016	But I say, Walk by the Spirit, and ye will not fulfill the desires of the flesh.
048	GAL	005	017	For the flesh hath desires against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these oppose one another, that ye may not do the things that ye would.
048	GAL	005	018	But if ye are led by the Spirit, ye are not under the Law.
048	GAL	005	019	Now the works of the flesh are manifest; such as fornication, uncleanness, wantonness,
048	GAL	005	020	idolatry, sorcery, hatreds, strife, rivalry, outbursts of wrath, cabals, divisions, factions,
048	GAL	005	021	envyings, drunkenness, revelings, and things like these; of which I tell you beforehand, as I also told you in time past, that they who practise such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.
048	GAL	005	022	But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,
048	GAL	005	023	meekness, temperance; against such things as these there is no law.
048	GAL	005	024	And they who belong to Christ Jesus crucified the flesh with the passions and lusts.
048	GAL	005	025	If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.
048	GAL	005	026	Let us not become vain-glorious, provoking one another, envying one another.
048	GAL	006	001	Brethren, even if a man be detected in a fault, do ye who are spiritual restore such a one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.
048	GAL	006	002	Bear ye one another's burdens, and thus fulfill the law of Christ.
048	GAL	006	003	For if a man thinketh himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.
048	GAL	006	004	But let each one prove his own work, and then will he have his ground for boasting in himself alone, and not in comparison with another;
048	GAL	006	005	for every one must bear his own load.
048	GAL	006	006	Let him that is taught in the word share with the teacher in all good things.
048	GAL	006	007	Be not deceived; God is not mocked; for whatever a man soweth, that shall he also reap;
048	GAL	006	008	for he that soweth to his flesh, shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit, shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.
048	GAL	006	009	And let us not be faint-hearted in well-doing; for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.
048	GAL	006	010	So then, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all, especially to those who are of the household of faith.
048	GAL	006	011	See in what large letters I have written to you with my own hand.
048	GAL	006	012	As many as desire to make a fair show in the flesh, these are constraining you to be circumcised, only that they may not suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.
048	GAL	006	013	For not even do they who become circumcised themselves keep the Law; but they desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.
048	GAL	006	014	But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ; through whom the world is crucified to me, and I to the world.
048	GAL	006	015	For neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.
048	GAL	006	016	And as many as walk by this rule, peace be upon them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.
048	GAL	006	017	Henceforth let no one trouble me; for I bear the marks of Jesus on my body.
048	GAL	006	018	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brethren. Amen.

049	EPH	001	001	Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, to the saints who are [[in Ephesus]], and believers in Christ Jesus:
049	EPH	001	002	Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
049	EPH	001	003	Blessed be God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly regions in Christ;
049	EPH	001	004	according as he chose us in him, before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him;
049	EPH	001	005	having in love predestinated us for himself to be adopted as sons through Jesus Christ, according to the good pleasure of his will,
049	EPH	001	006	to the praise of the glory of his grace, which he freely bestowed on us in the Beloved;
049	EPH	001	007	in whom we have the redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace,
049	EPH	001	008	which he made to abound toward us, in all wisdom and understanding;
049	EPH	001	009	having made known to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he purposed in himself
049	EPH	001	010	in reference to the dispensation of the fullness of the times, to gather for himself into one all things in Christ, the things which are in the heavens, and the things on the earth; even in him,
049	EPH	001	011	in whom we also obtained the inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will,
049	EPH	001	012	that we should be to the praise of his glory, we who have before placed our hope in the Messiah;
049	EPH	001	013	in whom ye also, after having heard the word of truth, the glad tidings of your salvation, in whom, I say, having also believed, ye were sealed with the Holy Spirit that was promised,
049	EPH	001	014	which is a pledge of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, to the praise of his glory.
049	EPH	001	015	For this cause I also, having heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and of your love to all the saints,
049	EPH	001	016	do not cease to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers;
049	EPH	001	017	that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, would give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of him;
049	EPH	001	018	the eyes of your mind being enlightened, that ye may know what is the hope belonging to his call of you, and what the riches of the glory of the inheritance which he hath given among the saints,
049	EPH	001	019	and what the exceeding greatness of his power toward us who believe, according to the working of his mighty power,
049	EPH	001	020	which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead; and seated him at his own right hand in the heavenly regions,
049	EPH	001	021	far above all rule, and authority, and power, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come;
049	EPH	001	022	and put all things in subjection under his feet, and gave him to be head over all things to the church,
049	EPH	001	023	which is his body, the fullness of him who filleth all with all;
049	EPH	002	001	and you also [[he raised up]], who were dead through your trespasses and sins,
049	EPH	002	002	in which ye once walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the powers of the air, the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience;
049	EPH	002	003	among whom even we all had our way of life in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the thoughts, and were by nature children of wrath, even as others;
049	EPH	002	004	but God, who is rich in mercy, on account of his great love wherewith he loved us, gave to us,
049	EPH	002	005	even when dead through our trespasses, life with Christ, —by grace have ye been saved, —
049	EPH	002	006	and raised us up with him, and caused us to sit with him in the heavenly regions in Christ Jesus,
049	EPH	002	007	that he might show in the ages to come the exceeding riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.
049	EPH	002	008	For by grace ye have been saved, through faith; and this is not of yourselves; it is the gift of God;
049	EPH	002	009	not of works, lest any one should boast.
049	EPH	002	010	For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God before prepared that we should walk in them.
049	EPH	002	011	Wherefore remember, that in time past ye, the gentiles in the flesh, who are called uncircumcised by those who are called circumcised, having the circumcision of the flesh, performed by hand, —
049	EPH	002	012	that ye were at that time without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of the promise, having no hope, and without God, in the world;
049	EPH	002	013	but now, in Christ Jesus, ye, who formerly were afar off, have been brought nigh by the blood of Christ.
049	EPH	002	014	For it is he who is our peace, who made both one, and broke down the middle wall of partition between us, that is, the enmity;
049	EPH	002	015	having abolished in his flesh the law of commandments contained in ordinances; that he might create of the two one new man in himself, thus making peace,
049	EPH	002	016	and might reconcile both to God in one body by the cross, having slain on it the enmity.
049	EPH	002	017	And he came and brought the glad tidings of peace to you who were afar off, and of peace to those that were near;
049	EPH	002	018	for through him we both have our access in one Spirit to the Father.
049	EPH	002	019	So then ye are no longer strangers and foreigners, but are fellow-citizens with the saints, and members of the household of God,
049	EPH	002	020	and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the chief corner-stone;
049	EPH	002	021	in whom all the building, fitly framed together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord;
049	EPH	002	022	in whom ye also are built together into a dwelling-place of God in the Spirit.
049	EPH	003	001	For this cause [[I bend my knees]], I Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for you gentiles;
049	EPH	003	002	if, indeed, ye heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which was given me toward you,
049	EPH	003	003	that by revelation the mystery was made known to me, as I wrote before in few words,
049	EPH	003	004	whereby, when ye read, ye may perceive my insight into the mystery of Christ;
049	EPH	003	005	which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men, as it hath now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit;
049	EPH	003	006	that the gentiles are fellow-heirs, and of the same body, and partakers with us of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel;
049	EPH	003	007	of which I became a minister according to the gift of the grace of God, given to me according to the effectual working of his power.
049	EPH	003	008	To me, who am less than the least of all saints, was this grace given, to make known among the gentiles the glad tidings of the unsearchable riches of Christ,
049	EPH	003	009	to make all men see what is the dispensation of the mystery, which hath been hidden for ages in God, who created all things;
049	EPH	003	010	to the intent that now to the principalities and powers in the heavenly regions might be known through the church the manifold wisdom of God,
049	EPH	003	011	according to his purpose for ages, which he accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord;
049	EPH	003	012	in whom we have our boldness and our access in confidence, through faith in him.
049	EPH	003	013	Wherefore I entreat you not to be disheartened by the troubles I am suffering for you, since they are your glory.
049	EPH	003	014	For this cause I bend my knees to the Father,
049	EPH	003	015	from whom every family in heaven and on earth receiveth its name,
049	EPH	003	016	that he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man;
049	EPH	003	017	that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith, ye having been rooted and grounded in love,
049	EPH	003	018	that ye may be able to comprehend, with all the saints, what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height,
049	EPH	003	019	and to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye may be filled unto all the fullness of God.
049	EPH	003	020	Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us,
049	EPH	003	021	to him be the glory in the church in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, for ever and ever. Amen.
049	EPH	004	001	I exhort you, therefore, I the prisoner in the Lord, to walk worthily of the calling with which ye were called,
049	EPH	004	002	with all humility and meekness, with long-suffering; bearing with one another in love,
049	EPH	004	003	endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.
049	EPH	004	004	There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye were called in one hope of your calling;
049	EPH	004	005	one Lord, one faith, one baptism,
049	EPH	004	006	one God and Father of all, who is over all, and through all, and in all.
049	EPH	004	007	But to each one of us was given the grace [[which he hath]] according to the measure of the gift of Christ.
049	EPH	004	008	Wherefore he saith: “When he ascended on high, he led captive a train of captives, and gave gifts to men.”
049	EPH	004	009	Now what is implied in his ascending, but that he also descended into the lower parts of the earth?
049	EPH	004	010	He who descended is the same as he who ascended far above all the heavens, that he might fill all things.
049	EPH	004	011	And he gave some to be apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;
049	EPH	004	012	for the perfecting of the saints for the work of ministration, for the building up of the body of Christ;
049	EPH	004	013	till we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a full-grown man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ;
049	EPH	004	014	that we may no longer be children, tossed to and fro and borne about by every wind of teaching, through the dishonest tricks of men, and their cunning in the wily arts of error;
049	EPH	004	015	but cleaving to truth in love, may grow up in all things unto him who is the head, even Christ;
049	EPH	004	016	from whom the whole body, well put together and compacted by means of every supplying joint, is, according to the working of each part in its proportion, building itself up in love.
049	EPH	004	017	This therefore I say, and charge you in the Lord, that ye no longer walk as the rest of the gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind,
049	EPH	004	018	having their understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God on account of the ignorance that is in them, on account of the hardness of their hearts;
049	EPH	004	019	who, being past feeling, have given themselves up to wantonness, to work all uncleanness in greediness.
049	EPH	004	020	But not so did ye learn Christ,
049	EPH	004	021	if indeed ye heard him, and were taught in him, as the truth is in Jesus;
049	EPH	004	022	that as to your former way of life ye should put off the old man, who perisheth according to the lusts of deceit,
049	EPH	004	023	and be renewed in the spirit of your mind,
049	EPH	004	024	and that ye put on the new man, who was created according to God in righteousness and holiness of the truth.
049	EPH	004	025	Wherefore having put away falsehood, speak truth every one with his neighbor; for we are members one of another.
049	EPH	004	026	“Be angry, and sin not;” let not the sun go down upon your wrath;
049	EPH	004	027	and do not give place to the Devil.
049	EPH	004	028	Let him that stealeth steal no more, but rather let him labor, working with his hands at that which is good, that he may have to give to him that is in need.
049	EPH	004	029	Let no foul language proceed out of your mouth, but whatever is good for edification, as the need may be, that it may benefit the hearers;
049	EPH	004	030	and grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye were sealed unto the day of redemption.
049	EPH	004	031	Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamor, and evil-speaking, be put away from you, with all malice;
049	EPH	004	032	and be kind to one another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, even as God in Christ forgave you.
049	EPH	005	001	Be therefore imitators of God, as beloved children;
049	EPH	005	002	and walk in love, as Christ also loved you, and gave himself for you an offering and a sacrifice to God, of a sweet odor.
049	EPH	005	003	But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not even be named among you, as becometh saints,
049	EPH	005	004	neither obscenity, nor foolish talking, nor indecent jesting, which are not becoming; but rather giving of thanks.
049	EPH	005	005	For of this ye are sure, since ye know that no whore-monger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.
049	EPH	005	006	Let no one deceive you with vain words; for because of these things the wrath of God cometh upon the sons of disobedience.
049	EPH	005	007	Be not therefore partakers with them.
049	EPH	005	008	For ye were once darkness, but now ye are light in the Lord. Walk as children of light,
049	EPH	005	009	—for the fruit of the light is in all goodness, and righteousness, and truth, —
049	EPH	005	010	proving what is acceptable to the Lord;
049	EPH	005	011	and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather even reprove them.
049	EPH	005	012	For the things done in secret by them it is a shame even to speak of.
049	EPH	005	013	But all things, when reproved, are made manifest by the light; for whatever maketh manifest is light.
049	EPH	005	014	Wherefore he saith, “Awake, thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ will give thee light.”
049	EPH	005	015	See then that ye walk circumspectly; not as unwise men, but as wise;
049	EPH	005	016	buying up for yourselves opportunities, because the days are evil.
049	EPH	005	017	Wherefore be not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is.
049	EPH	005	018	And be not drunk with wine, in which is dissoluteness, but be filled with the Spirit,
049	EPH	005	019	speaking to one another in psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;
049	EPH	005	020	giving thanks always for all things to God, the Father, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
049	EPH	005	021	submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of Christ.
049	EPH	005	022	Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands, as to the Lord;
049	EPH	005	023	for the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church, —he, who is the Saviour of the body.
049	EPH	005	024	But as the church is subject to Christ, so let wives be to their husbands in everything.
049	EPH	005	025	Husbands, love your wives, as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself up for it,
049	EPH	005	026	that he might sanctify it, having cleansed it by the bath of the water in the word;
049	EPH	005	027	that he himself might present to himself the church, glorious, having no spot or wrinkle, or any such thing, but that it should be holy and without blemish.
049	EPH	005	028	In like manner husbands ought to love their own wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his own wife loveth himself;
049	EPH	005	029	for no one ever yet hated his own flesh, but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as Christ doth the church;
049	EPH	005	030	for we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.
049	EPH	005	031	“For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.”
049	EPH	005	032	This mystery is a great one; but I am speaking of Christ and of the church.
049	EPH	005	033	However, do ye also severally love each one his own wife as himself; and let the wife see that she reverence her husband.
049	EPH	006	001	Children, obey your parents in the Lord; for this is right.
049	EPH	006	002	“Honor thy father and mother;” which is the first commandment with a promise;
049	EPH	006	003	“that it may be well with thee, and thou mayst live long on the earth.”
049	EPH	006	004	And, ye fathers, stir not up the anger of your children, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord.
049	EPH	006	005	Bond-servants, obey your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as serving Christ;
049	EPH	006	006	not with eye-service as men-pleasers, but as bond-servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;
049	EPH	006	007	doing service with good will, as to the Lord, and not to men;
049	EPH	006	008	knowing that whatever good each one shall have done, that shall he receive from the Lord, whether he be bondman or free.
049	EPH	006	009	And, ye masters, do the same things to them, forbearing threatening; knowing that both they and you have a Master in heaven, and that there is no respect of persons with him.
049	EPH	006	010	Finally, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.
049	EPH	006	011	Put on the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the Devil;
049	EPH	006	012	for our wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the world-rulers of this darkness, against the spiritual hosts of evil in the heavenly regions.
049	EPH	006	013	Wherefore take up the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.
049	EPH	006	014	Stand therefore, having girded your loins with truth, and having put on the breast-plate of righteousness,
049	EPH	006	015	and having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace;
049	EPH	006	016	taking up, in addition to all, the shield of faith, by which ye will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the Evil One;
049	EPH	006	017	and receive the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God;
049	EPH	006	018	praying with all prayer and entreaty at all times in the Spirit; and watching to this end with all perseverance and entreaty for all the saints,
049	EPH	006	019	and for me, that utterance may be given me in the opening of my mouth, to make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel,
049	EPH	006	020	in behalf of which I am an ambassador in chains; that I may proclaim it boldly, as I ought to speak.
049	EPH	006	021	But that ye also may know about me, how I am faring, Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful servant in the Lord, will inform you of everything;
049	EPH	006	022	whom I have sent to you for this very purpose, that ye may know about us, and that he may comfort your hearts.
049	EPH	006	023	Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
049	EPH	006	024	Grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ with an incorruptible love.

# BOOK	050	PHI	Philippians	Philippians
050	PHI	001	001	Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, together with the bishops and deacons:
050	PHI	001	002	Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
050	PHI	001	003	I thank my God in all my remembrance of you,
050	PHI	001	004	always in every prayer of mine for you all making my prayer with joy
050	PHI	001	005	on account of your fellowship in the cause of the gospel from the first day until now;
050	PHI	001	006	being confident of this very thing, that he who began in you a good work, will perfect it until the day of Christ Jesus;
050	PHI	001	007	even as it is right for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, all of you being sharers of the grace bestowed on me.
050	PHI	001	008	For God is my witness how much I long for you all in the tender affection of Christ Jesus.
050	PHI	001	009	And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all discernment;
050	PHI	001	010	so that ye may approve the things that are most excellent, in order that ye may be pure and without offence against the day of Christ,
050	PHI	001	011	being filled with the fruit of righteousness which is through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.
050	PHI	001	012	But I wish you to know, brethren, that things with me have resulted in the furtherance of the gospel;
050	PHI	001	013	so that my bonds have become known in connection with Christ in the whole camp of the imperial guards, and to all the rest;
050	PHI	001	014	and that the great part of the brethren, made confident in the Lord by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.
050	PHI	001	015	Some indeed preach Christ even from envy and strife, and some also from good will.
050	PHI	001	016	but they who are of a factious spirit preach Christ with no pure intent, thinking to stir up affliction to my bonds.
050	PHI	001	017	They who are of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel;
050	PHI	001	018	What then? Notwithstanding, in every way, whether in pretence or in truth, Christ is preached; and therein do I rejoice, yea, and shall rejoice.
050	PHI	001	019	For I know that this will turn out to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,
050	PHI	001	020	according to my earnest expectation and hope, that in nothing I shall be put to shame, but that with all boldness, as always, so also now, Christ will be magnified in my body, whether by life, or by death.
050	PHI	001	021	For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.
050	PHI	001	022	But if to live in the flesh, if this is to me the fruit of my labor, then what I should choose, I cannot say;
050	PHI	001	023	but I am held in a strait by the two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; for it is far better;
050	PHI	001	024	but to abide in the flesh is more needful for your sake.
050	PHI	001	025	And being persuaded of this, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your advancement and joy in your faith,
050	PHI	001	026	that your glorying in me, in the cause of Christ Jesus, may be more abundant by my coming to you again.
050	PHI	001	027	Only conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ, that whether I come and see you, or remain absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one soul striving together for the faith of the gospel,
050	PHI	001	028	and in nothing terrified by your adversaries; which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation; and that from God;
050	PHI	001	029	for to you it was given in behalf of Christ, not only to believe in him, but in his behalf to suffer also;
050	PHI	001	030	as ye have the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear of in me.
050	PHI	002	001	If then there is any exhortation in Christ, if any encouragement from love, if any partaking of the Spirit, if any tenderness and compassion,
050	PHI	002	002	make my joy full, that ye be of the same mind, having the same love, with union of soul cherishing one mind;
050	PHI	002	003	doing nothing in the spirit of faction, or in the spirit of vain-glory, but in humility esteeming others as better than yourselves;
050	PHI	002	004	looking each of you not to his own interest, but each to the interest of others also.
050	PHI	002	005	Yea, let this mind be in you which was in Christ Jesus,
050	PHI	002	006	who, being in the form of God, did not regard it as a thing to be grasped at to be on an equality with God,
050	PHI	002	007	but made himself of no consideration, taking the form of a servant, and becoming like men;
050	PHI	002	008	and in what appertained to him appearing as a man, he humbled himself, and was obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.
050	PHI	002	009	Wherefore God also highly exalted him, and gave him a name which is above every name;
050	PHI	002	010	that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those who are in heaven, and those on earth, and those under the earth,
050	PHI	002	011	and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God, the Father.
050	PHI	002	012	So then, my beloved, as ye always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling;
050	PHI	002	013	for it is God who worketh in you both to will and to work for his good pleasure.
050	PHI	002	014	Do all things without murmurings and doubts;
050	PHI	002	015	that ye may be blameless and pure, children of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation; among whom ye shine as luminaries in the world,
050	PHI	002	016	holding forth the word of life, that I may have whereof to boast against the day of Christ, that I did not run in vain, or labor in vain.
050	PHI	002	017	But if I am even poured out on the sacrifice and ministration of your faith, I rejoice, and rejoice with you all.
050	PHI	002	018	For the same reason, do ye also rejoice, and rejoice with me.
050	PHI	002	019	But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, that I also may be cheered when I know your state.
050	PHI	002	020	For I have no one like-minded, who will have a true concern for your state;
050	PHI	002	021	for all of them are seeking their own things, not those of Christ Jesus.
050	PHI	002	022	But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son serves a father, he served with me for the gospel.
050	PHI	002	023	Him therefore I hope to send forthwith, as soon as I see how it will go with me;
050	PHI	002	024	but I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come soon.
050	PHI	002	025	Yet I thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labor, and fellow-soldier, but your messenger, and minister to my wants;
050	PHI	002	026	for he was longing after you all, and was much troubled, because ye heard that he was sick.
050	PHI	002	027	For indeed he was sick near to death; but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.
050	PHI	002	028	I send him therefore the more speedily, that when ye see him ye may again rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.
050	PHI	002	029	Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness, and hold such in honor;
050	PHI	002	030	because he was near to death on account of the work, hazarding his life to supply what was wanting on your part in the ministration to me.
050	PHI	003	001	Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord; to write the same things to you, to me is not burdensome, and for you it is safe.
050	PHI	003	002	Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workmen, beware of the concision.
050	PHI	003	003	For we are the circumcision, who worship by the Spirit of God, and glory in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh;
050	PHI	003	004	though I myself have reason for confidence even in the flesh. If any other man thinketh that he hath reason for confidence in the flesh, I more;
050	PHI	003	005	circumcised the eighth day, of the race of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of the Hebrews; as to the Law, a Pharisee;
050	PHI	003	006	as to zeal, persecuting the church; as to the righteousness which is in the Law, blameless.
050	PHI	003	007	But whatever things were gain to me, those for the sake of Christ I have counted but loss.
050	PHI	003	008	Nay more, I count all things to be loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them as refuse, that I may gain Christ,
050	PHI	003	009	and be found in him, not having my own righteousness, which is of the Law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is from God upon faith;
050	PHI	003	010	that I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, while becoming like him in his death,
050	PHI	003	011	if by any means I may attain to the resurrection from the dead.
050	PHI	003	012	Not that I have already obtained, or have been already perfected; but I press on, if I may also lay hold of that for which I was laid hold of by Christ.
050	PHI	003	013	Brethren, I do not reckon myself to have laid hold of it; but one thing I do, forgetting the things that are behind, and stretching forth to the things that are before,
050	PHI	003	014	I press toward the mark for the prize of the heavenly calling of God in Christ Jesus.
050	PHI	003	015	Let us, therefore, as many as are perfect, be of this mind; and if ye have a different mind in anything, even this will God reveal to you.
050	PHI	003	016	Nevertheless, whereto we have reached, in that let us walk.
050	PHI	003	017	Brethren, be ye followers together of me, and mark those who walk as ye have us for an example.
050	PHI	003	018	For many walk, of whom I told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ;
050	PHI	003	019	whose end is destruction, whose God is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame, whose mind is on earthly things.
050	PHI	003	020	For the country of which we are citizens is heaven, whence also we wait for a Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ,
050	PHI	003	021	who will transform the body of our humiliation so that it shall be conformed to the body of his glory, according to the working of the power with which he is able to subdue all things to himself.
050	PHI	004	001	Therefore, my brethren, beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, beloved.
050	PHI	004	002	I exhort Euodia, and I exhort Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord;
050	PHI	004	003	yea, I entreat thee also, true yoke-fellow, give them aid; since they labored with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and the rest of my fellow-laborers, whose names are in the book of life.
050	PHI	004	004	Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say it, rejoice.
050	PHI	004	005	Let your moderation be known to all men. The Lord is at hand.
050	PHI	004	006	Be anxious about nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God;
050	PHI	004	007	and the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, will keep your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.
050	PHI	004	008	Finally, brethren, whatever things are true, whatever things are honorable, whatever things are right, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report, if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.
050	PHI	004	009	The things which ye learned, and received, and heard, and saw in me, these do; and the God of peace will be with you.
050	PHI	004	010	But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at length ye have revived again in your care for my welfare; for which indeed ye cared before, but lacked opportunity.
050	PHI	004	011	Not that I speak on account of want; for I have learned, in whatever state I am, therewith to be content.
050	PHI	004	012	I know how to be abased, and I know also how to abound; in every thing and in all things I have been well taught, both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to be in want;
050	PHI	004	013	I can do all things in him who strengtheneth me.
050	PHI	004	014	Notwithstanding, ye did well in sharing with me in my distress.
050	PHI	004	015	And ye yourselves also know, Philippians, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I went forth from Macedonia, no church communicated with me in an account of giving and receiving, but ye only;
050	PHI	004	016	for even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again to my necessity.
050	PHI	004	017	Not that I seek for such a gift, but I do seek for fruit that may abound to your account.
050	PHI	004	018	But I have all, and abound; I am full, having received from Epaphroditus what was sent from you, a sweet odor, a sacrifice acceptable, well-pleasing to God.
050	PHI	004	019	But my God will supply all your need according to his riches in glory, in Christ Jesus.
050	PHI	004	020	Now to God, our Father, be glory for ever. Amen.
050	PHI	004	021	Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren who are with me salute you.
050	PHI	004	022	All the saints salute you, but especially they who are of Caesar's household.
050	PHI	004	023	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.

051	COL	001	001	Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy the brother,
051	COL	001	002	to the saints and faithful brethren in Christ at Colossae: Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father.
051	COL	001	003	We give thanks to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,
051	COL	001	004	since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which ye have to all the saints,
051	COL	001	005	on account of the hope which is laid up for you in the heavens, of which ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel,
051	COL	001	006	which is come to you, as it is in all the world, and is bearing fruit and growing, as it doth also in you, from the day ye heard it, and knew the grace of God in truth;
051	COL	001	007	even as ye learned from Epaphras our beloved fellow-servant, who is a faithful minister of Christ on your behalf;
051	COL	001	008	who also brought to our knowledge your love in the Spirit.
051	COL	001	009	On this account we also, from the day we heard of it, cease not to pray for you, and to ask that ye may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;
051	COL	001	010	that ye may walk worthily of the Lord so as to please him in all things, bearing fruit in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;
051	COL	001	011	endued with all power according to the might of his glory unto all patience and long-suffering with joy;
051	COL	001	012	giving thanks to the Father, who enabled us to share in the inheritance of the saints in the light;
051	COL	001	013	who rescued us from the empire of darkness, and transferred us into the kingdom of his beloved Son;
051	COL	001	014	in whom we have our redemption, the forgiveness of our sins; —
051	COL	001	015	who is the image of the invisible God, the first-born of the whole creation;
051	COL	001	016	for in him were created all things, those in the heavens, and those on the earth, the visible and the invisible, whether thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers, all things have been created through him and for him;
051	COL	001	017	and he is before all things, and in him all things subsist.
051	COL	001	018	And he is the head of the body, the church; since he is the beginning, the first-born from the dead, that he may be in all things pre-eminent;
051	COL	001	019	for God was pleased that in him all the fullness should dwell, and by him to reconcile all things to himself,
051	COL	001	020	having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him, I say, whether the things on earth, or those in the heavens.
051	COL	001	021	And you, that were once alienated, and enemies in your mind in wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled
051	COL	001	022	in the body of his flesh through his death, to present you holy and blameless and irreproachable in his sight;
051	COL	001	023	if ye indeed continue in the faith grounded and settled, and not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye heard, which hath been preached in the whole creation under heaven; of which I Paul became a minister.
051	COL	001	024	Now I rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up instead that which is wanting of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh on behalf of his body, which is the church;
051	COL	001	025	of which I became a minister, according to the stewardship which God entrusted to me, for you, to fulfill the word of God,
051	COL	001	026	the mystery which hath been hidden for ages and generations, but hath been now revealed to his saints;
051	COL	001	027	to whom it was the will of God to make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory;
051	COL	001	028	whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ;
051	COL	001	029	to which end I also am laboring, striving earnestly through his working, which worketh within me mightily.
051	COL	002	001	For I would have you know what a great struggle I have for you, and for those in Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;
051	COL	002	002	that their hearts may be encouraged, they being knit together in love, and that they may attain to all the riches of a full assurance of the understanding, to the full knowledge of the mystery of God;
051	COL	002	003	in which are stored up all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
051	COL	002	004	And this I say, that no one may impose on you by specious discourses.
051	COL	002	005	For though I am absent in the flesh, yet in the spirit I am with you, rejoicing and beholding your order, and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ.
051	COL	002	006	As therefore ye have received Christ Jesus the Lord, walk in him,
051	COL	002	007	rooted and built up in him, and established in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving.
051	COL	002	008	Beware lest there be some one who shall make a prey of you through philosophy and vain deceit, according to the tradition of men, according to the rudiments of the world, and not according to Christ.
051	COL	002	009	For in him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily,
051	COL	002	010	and ye are made full in him, who is the head of all principality and power;
051	COL	002	011	in whom also ye have been circumcised with a circumcision not performed by hand, in putting off the body of the flesh in the circumcision of Christ,
051	COL	002	012	having been buried with him in your baptism; in which also ye were raised to life with him through faith in the working of God, who raised him from the dead;
051	COL	002	013	and to you also who were dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he given life together with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses;
051	COL	002	014	blotting out the handwriting in ordinances that was against us, which was opposed to us, he hath taken it out of the way, nailing it to the cross;
051	COL	002	015	and having disarmed principalities and powers, he made a public show of them, and led them captive in triumph in him.
051	COL	002	016	Let no one then call you to account about food or drink, or a feast-day, or a new moon, or sabbaths;
051	COL	002	017	which are a shadow of the things to come, but the body is Christ's.
051	COL	002	018	Let no one defraud you of the prize, desiring to do it in humiliation and worshipping of the angels, intruding into those things which he hath not seen, puffed up without reason by the mind of his own flesh,
051	COL	002	019	and not holding fast the Head, from which the whole body, supported and compacted by means of the joints and ligaments, groweth with an increase wrought by God.
051	COL	002	020	If ye died with Christ to the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, do ye subject yourselves to ordinances, such as,
051	COL	002	021	Handle not, Taste not, Touch not,
051	COL	002	022	(which all are to perish with the using, ) after the commandments and teachings of men;
051	COL	002	023	which things have indeed a show of wisdom in will-worship and humiliation and severity to the body, not in any honor for the satisfying of the flesh.
051	COL	003	001	If then ye were raised together with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is sitting on the right hand of God.
051	COL	003	002	Set your mind on the things above, not on things on the earth.
051	COL	003	003	For ye died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God;
051	COL	003	004	when Christ, our life, shall be manifested, then will ye also be manifested with him in glory.
051	COL	003	005	Make dead therefore your members which are upon the earth, fornication, uncleanness, lust, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry;
051	COL	003	006	on account of which things cometh the wrath of God.
051	COL	003	007	In which things ye also once walked, when ye lived in them;
051	COL	003	008	but now put ye away all these, anger, wrath, malice, evil-speaking, filthy language out of your mouth.
051	COL	003	009	Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds,
051	COL	003	010	and have put on the new man, who is renewed unto knowledge after the image of him that created him;
051	COL	003	011	where there is no Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bondman, freeman; but Christ is all, and in all.
051	COL	003	012	Clothe yourselves, therefore, as the chosen of God, holy and beloved, with compassionate affections, kindness, lowliness of mind, meekness, long-suffering;
051	COL	003	013	bearing with each other, and forgiving each other, if any one have a complaint against another; even as Christ freely forgave you, do ye also freely forgive;
051	COL	003	014	and over all these things put on the robe of love, which is the bond of perfectness;
051	COL	003	015	and let the peace of Christ, to which ye were called in one body, rule in your hearts; and be ye thankful.
051	COL	003	016	Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly; in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another with psalms, hymns, spiritual songs, in grace singing in your hearts to God;
051	COL	003	017	and whatever ye do, in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God, the Father, through him.
051	COL	003	018	Wives, submit yourselves to your husbands, as it is fit in the Lord.
051	COL	003	019	Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them.
051	COL	003	020	Children, obey your parents in all things; for this is well-pleasing in the Lord.
051	COL	003	021	Fathers, provoke not your children, lest they be discouraged.
051	COL	003	022	Bond-servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh, not with eye-service, as men-pleasers, but in singleness of heart, fearing the Lord.
051	COL	003	023	Whatever ye do, do it from the heart, as to the Lord, and not to men,
051	COL	003	024	knowing that from the Lord ye will receive the recompense of the inheritance; serve Christ as your Lord.
051	COL	003	025	For he that doeth wrong, shall receive back the wrong which he hath done; and there is no respect of persons.
051	COL	004	001	Masters, deal out to your bond-servants justice and equity, knowing that ye also have a master in heaven.
051	COL	004	002	Persevere in prayer, being watchful therein with thanksgiving;
051	COL	004	003	praying at the same time for us also, that God may open to us a door for the word, to speak the mystery of Christ, for the sake of which I am also in bonds;
051	COL	004	004	that I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak.
051	COL	004	005	Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, buying up opportunities.
051	COL	004	006	Let your speech be always with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer every one.
051	COL	004	007	Of all my affairs Tychicus will inform you, the beloved brother and faithful minister and fellow-servant in the Lord;
051	COL	004	008	whom I have sent to you for this very purpose, that he may know your condition, and comfort your hearts;
051	COL	004	009	together with Onesimus, the faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They will inform you of every thing here.
051	COL	004	010	Aristarchus, my fellow-prisoner, saluteth you, and Mark, the cousin of Barnabas, concerning whom ye received directions (if he come to you, receive him),
051	COL	004	011	and Jesus, who is called Justus; who are of the circumcision; these only are my fellow-workers for the kingdom of God, who have been an encouragement unto me.
051	COL	004	012	Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ Jesus, saluteth you, always striving for you in his prayers, that ye may stand perfect and fully assured in all the will of God.
051	COL	004	013	For I bear him witness, that he hath much labor for you, and those that are in Laodicea, and those in Hierapolis.
051	COL	004	014	Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas, salute you.
051	COL	004	015	Salute the brethren which are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church in his house.
051	COL	004	016	And when the letter hath been read among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans, and that ye likewise read the letter from Laodicea.
051	COL	004	017	And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfill it.
051	COL	004	018	The salutation by the hand of me, Paul. Remember my bonds. Grace be with you.

# BOOK	052	1TH	1 Thessalonians	1 Thessalonians
052	1TH	001	001	Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace be to you, and peace.
052	1TH	001	002	We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers,
052	1TH	001	003	remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labor of love, and perseverance in the hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, before God our Father;
052	1TH	001	004	since we know, brethren beloved of God, that he hath chosen you;
052	1TH	001	005	because the gospel preached by us came not to you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and in much assurance; as ye well know what sort of persons we became among you for your sake.
052	1TH	001	006	And ye became imitators of us and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction with joy from the Holy Spirit;
052	1TH	001	007	so that ye became an example to all that believe in Macedonia and in Achaia.
052	1TH	001	008	For from you the word of the Lord hath sounded forth not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but in every place your faith toward God hath become known; so that we need not say anything [[about you]].
052	1TH	001	009	For they themselves are reporting concerning us what kind of reception we had among you, and how ye turned to God from idols, to serve the living and true God,
052	1TH	001	010	and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus, who delivereth us from the coming wrath.
052	1TH	002	001	For ye yourselves know, brethren, that our coming among you hath not been in vain;
052	1TH	002	002	but after we had suffered before and had been shamefully treated, as ye know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak to you the gospel of God in much conflict.
052	1TH	002	003	For our teaching is not from error, nor from impurity, nor in guile;
052	1TH	002	004	but as we have been regarded by God as worthy to be intrusted with the gospel, so we speak, not as pleasing men, but God, who trieth our hearts.
052	1TH	002	005	For neither at any time did we use flattering words, as ye know, nor a cloak of covetousness, God is witness;
052	1TH	002	006	nor from men sought we glory, either from you, or from others; though we might have used authority as apostles of Christ.
052	1TH	002	007	But we were gentle in the midst of you, even as a nurse cherisheth her own children;
052	1TH	002	008	so having a strong affection for you, we were willing to impart to you, not only the gospel of God, but also our own souls, because ye became dear to us.
052	1TH	002	009	For ye remember, brethren, our labor and toil, how laboring night and day, that we might not be burdensome to any of you, we preached to you the gospel of God.
052	1TH	002	010	Ye are witnesses, and so is God, how holily, and righteously, and unblamably we conducted ourselves toward you that believe;
052	1TH	002	011	as ye know how we exhorted, and encouraged, and charged every one of you, as a father doth his children,
052	1TH	002	012	that ye should walk in a manner worthy of God, who is calling you to his own kingdom and glory.
052	1TH	002	013	And for this cause we also thank God without ceasing, that, when ye received the word of God which ye heard from us, ye received it not as the word of men, but, as it is in truth, the word of God, which also is powerfully working in you that believe.
052	1TH	002	014	For ye, brethren, became imitators of the churches of God which are in Judaea in Christ Jesus; for ye also suffered the same things from your own countrymen, as they have from the Jews;
052	1TH	002	015	who both killed the Lord Jesus, and the prophets, and drove us out, and please not God, and set themselves against all men,
052	1TH	002	016	hindering us from speaking to the gentiles that they may be saved, —to fill up their sins always! But the wrath is come upon them to the end.
052	1TH	002	017	But we, brethren, having been bereaved of you for a short time, separated in body, not in heart, used the greater endeavors with much earnestness to see your face.
052	1TH	002	018	Wherefore we purposed to come to you, that is, I Paul, once and again; but Satan hindered us.
052	1TH	002	019	For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of glorying? Is it not even ye, in the presence of our Lord Jesus at his coming?
052	1TH	002	020	For ye are our glory and joy.
052	1TH	003	001	Wherefore, when we could no longer forbear, we chose to be left at Athens alone,
052	1TH	003	002	and sent Timothy, our brother and a fellow-laborer with God in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to encourage you in your faith,
052	1TH	003	003	so that no one should be shaken by these afflictions; for yourselves know that to this we are appointed;
052	1TH	003	004	for even when we were with you, we told you before that we are to suffer affliction, just as it came to pass, and ye know.
052	1TH	003	005	For this cause, when I too could no longer forbear, I sent in order to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter might have tempted you, and our labor should prove in vain.
052	1TH	003	006	But when Timothy just now came to us from you, and brought us good tidings of your faith and love, and that ye have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also to see you;
052	1TH	003	007	for this cause, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our distress and affliction by your faith;
052	1TH	003	008	for now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord.
052	1TH	003	009	For what thanks can we render to God for you, for all the joy wherewith we rejoice for your sakes before our God;
052	1TH	003	010	night and day praying exceedingly that we may see your face, and may supply that which is lacking in your faith?
052	1TH	003	011	Now God himself, our Father, and our Lord Jesus direct our way to you;
052	1TH	003	012	and the Lord make you to increase and abound in love toward one another and toward all, even as we do in love toward you;
052	1TH	003	013	in order that he may establish your hearts unblamable in holiness before God, our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his holy ones.
052	1TH	004	001	Furthermore then, brethren, we beseech you, and exhort you in the Lord Jesus, that, as ye received from us how ye ought to walk and to please God, even as ye are walking, ye would abound still more;
052	1TH	004	002	for ye know what commands we gave you through the Lord Jesus.
052	1TH	004	003	For this is the will of God, your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication;
052	1TH	004	004	that every one of you should know how to procure for himself his own vessel in purity and honor,
052	1TH	004	005	not in the passion of lust, even as the gentiles who know not God;
052	1TH	004	006	that no one should go beyond and overreach his brother in the matter; because the Lord is the avenger in respect to all these things, as we also told you before and solemnly testified.
052	1TH	004	007	For God did not call us to live in uncleanness, but in purity.
052	1TH	004	008	He therefore that rejecteth, rejecteth not man, but God, who also gave to you his Holy Spirit.
052	1TH	004	009	But concerning brotherly love there is no need of writing to you; for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another;
052	1TH	004	010	for indeed ye do it toward all the brethren who are in all Macedonia. But we exhort you, brethren, to abound in love still more;
052	1TH	004	011	and to study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;
052	1TH	004	012	that ye may walk becomingly toward those without, and may have need of nothing.
052	1TH	004	013	But we would not have you ignorant, brethren, concerning those who are sleeping, that ye may not sorrow, as others do, who have no hope.
052	1TH	004	014	For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, then also will God, through Jesus, bring again with him those who have fallen asleep.
052	1TH	004	015	For this we say to you in the word of the Lord, that we who are living, we who are left till the coming of the Lord, shall not anticipate those who have fallen asleep.
052	1TH	004	016	For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a loud summons, with the voice of an archangel, and with the trump of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first;
052	1TH	004	017	then we who are living, we who are left, shall be caught up together with them in clouds, to meet the Lord in the air; and so shall we be ever with the Lord.
052	1TH	004	018	So then comfort one another with these words.
052	1TH	005	001	But concerning the times and the seasons, brethren, there is no need of writing to you;
052	1TH	005	002	for ye yourselves know full well, that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.
052	1TH	005	003	When they are saying, Peace and safety; then doth sudden destruction come upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.
052	1TH	005	004	But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that the day should overtake you as a thief;
052	1TH	005	005	for ye all are sons of light, and sons of the day; we are not of the night, nor of darkness.
052	1TH	005	006	Let us not sleep, then, as others, but let us watch and be sober.
052	1TH	005	007	For they that sleep, sleep in the night; and they that are drunken, are drunken in the night;
052	1TH	005	008	but let us, as we are of the day, be sober, putting on the breast-plate of faith and love, and as a helmet, the hope of salvation;
052	1TH	005	009	for God did not appoint us to wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,
052	1TH	005	010	who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should together live with him.
052	1TH	005	011	Wherefore, encourage one another, and edify one another, as indeed ye are doing.
052	1TH	005	012	And we beseech you, brethren, to know those who labor among you, and preside over you in the Lord, and admonish you,
052	1TH	005	013	and to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake. Be at peace among yourselves.
052	1TH	005	014	Moreover we exhort you, brethren, admonish the unruly, comfort the feeble-minded, support the weak, be forbearing to all.
052	1TH	005	015	See that none render evil for evil to any one; but ever follow that which is good, both toward one another and toward all.
052	1TH	005	016	Be always joyful.
052	1TH	005	017	Pray without ceasing;
052	1TH	005	018	in everything give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus in regard to you.
052	1TH	005	019	Quench not the Spirit;
052	1TH	005	020	despise not prophesyings,
052	1TH	005	021	but prove all things; hold fast that which is good;
052	1TH	005	022	abstain from every form of evil.
052	1TH	005	023	And may the God of peace himself sanctify you wholly; and may your spirit, and soul, and body, be preserved whole, without blame at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
052	1TH	005	024	Faithful is he who calleth you, who also will do it.
052	1TH	005	025	Brethren, pray for us.
052	1TH	005	026	Salute all the brethren with a holy kiss.
052	1TH	005	027	I adjure you by the Lord, that this letter be read to all the holy brethren.
052	1TH	005	028	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.

# BOOK	053	2TH	2 Thessalonians	2 Thessalonians
053	2TH	001	001	Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:
053	2TH	001	002	Grace be to you, and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
053	2TH	001	003	We ought to thank God always for you, brethren, as is fit, because your faith increaseth exceedingly, and the love of every one of you all toward each ether aboundeth;
053	2TH	001	004	so that we ourselves glory in you among the churches of God, for your constancy and faith in all your persecutions and the afflictions which ye endure;
053	2TH	001	005	an indication of the righteous judgment of God, by which ye will be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye are also suffering;
053	2TH	001	006	since it will be just with God to repay distress to them that distress you,
053	2TH	001	007	and to you the distressed rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be manifested from heaven, with the angels of his might,
053	2TH	001	008	in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus;
053	2TH	001	009	who will be punished with everlasting destruction proceeding from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his power,
053	2TH	001	010	when he shall come in that day to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all who believed; for our testimony to you was believed.
053	2TH	001	011	For which end we also pray always for you, that our God may count you worthy of your calling, and perfect [[in you]] all pleasure in goodness, and the work of faith, with power;
053	2TH	001	012	that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and ye in him, according to the grace of our God and of the Lord Jesus Christ.
053	2TH	002	001	Now we beseech you, brethren, concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and our being assembled together unto him,
053	2TH	002	002	that ye be not easily shaken in mind, nor troubled, either by spirit, or by word, or by letter as from us, as if the day of the Lord were close at hand.
053	2TH	002	003	Let no one deceive you in any manner; for [[that day will not come]] unless the apostasy shall have come first and the man of sin have been revealed, the son of perdition;
053	2TH	002	004	he that opposeth and exalteth himself above every one that is called God, or worthy of worship, so that he sitteth in the temple of God, showing himself to be God.
053	2TH	002	005	Do ye not remember, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things?
053	2TH	002	006	And now ye know what restraineth, in order that he may be revealed in his own time.
053	2TH	002	007	For the mystery of lawlessness is already working; only there is one who now restraineth, until he be taken out of the way;
053	2TH	002	008	and then will the lawless one be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will consume with the breath of his mouth, and destroy with the manifestation of his coming;
053	2TH	002	009	[[he, ]] whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power, and signs, and wonders of falsehood,
053	2TH	002	010	and in all deceit of unrighteousness for those who are perishing; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.
053	2TH	002	011	And for this cause God sendeth them a working of delusion, that they may believe the falsehood;
053	2TH	002	012	that they may all be judged, who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.
053	2TH	002	013	But we are bound to give thanks always to God for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, that God chose you from the beginning to salvation in sanctification of the Spirit, and belief of the truth;
053	2TH	002	014	whereunto he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
053	2TH	002	015	So then, brethren, stand firm, and hold fast the traditions which ye were taught by us, whether by word, or by our letter.
053	2TH	002	016	Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, our Father, who loved us, and gave us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace,
053	2TH	002	017	encourage your hearts, and establish you in every good work and word.
053	2TH	003	001	Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may run and be glorified, as with you,
053	2TH	003	002	and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men; for it is not all that have faith.
053	2TH	003	003	But faithful is the Lord, who will establish you, and guard you from evil.
053	2TH	003	004	And we have confidence in the Lord concerning you, that ye both do and will do the things which we command you.
053	2TH	003	005	And the Lord direct your hearts to the love of God, and to perseverance in the cause of Christ.
053	2TH	003	006	Now we charge you, brethren, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition which they received of us.
053	2TH	003	007	For ye yourselves know how ye ought to imitate us; for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you,
053	2TH	003	008	neither did we eat any man's bread for nought, but were working with labor and travail night and day, that we might not be burdensome to any of you.
053	2TH	003	009	Not because we have not authority, but to make ourselves an example to you, that ye should imitate us.
053	2TH	003	010	For also when we were with you, this we commanded you: If any one will not work, neither let him eat.
053	2TH	003	011	For we hear of some who walk among you disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies.
053	2TH	003	012	Now such we charge and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread.
053	2TH	003	013	But ye, brethren, be not weary in well-doing.
053	2TH	003	014	And if any one obey not our word by this epistle, mark that man; and keep no company with him, that he may be shamed;
053	2TH	003	015	yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.
053	2TH	003	016	Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always in every way; the Lord be with you all.
053	2TH	003	017	The salutation by the hand of me, Paul; which is the token in every letter; so I write.
053	2TH	003	018	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.

# BOOK	054	1TI	1 Timothy	1 Timothy
054	1TI	001	001	Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus, through the command of God, our Saviour, and Christ Jesus, our hope,
054	1TI	001	002	to Timothy, my true child in the faith: Grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
054	1TI	001	003	As I besought thee, when I set out for Macedonia, to remain still in Ephesus, that thou mightst charge certain persons not to teach other doctrine,
054	1TI	001	004	nor to give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which occasion disputes rather than promote God's dispensation which is in faith, [[so I do now.]]
054	1TI	001	005	Now the end of the commandment is love, out of a pure heart and a good conscience and faith unfeigned;
054	1TI	001	006	from which some swerving turned aside to vain babbling,
054	1TI	001	007	desiring to be teachers of the Law, understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm.
054	1TI	001	008	But we know that the Law is good, if a man use it lawfully,
054	1TI	001	009	knowing this, that the Law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and unruly, for the ungodly and sinful, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for man-slayers,
054	1TI	001	010	for whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for men-stealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to the sound teaching,
054	1TI	001	011	according to the glorious gospel of the blessed God which was committed to my trust.
054	1TI	001	012	And I thank him who gave me strength, Christ Jesus our Lord, that he accounted me faithful, putting me into the ministry, t
054	1TI	001	013	though formerly I was a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and a doer of outrage; but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly, in unbelief;
054	1TI	001	014	and the grace of our Lord was exceedingly abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.
054	1TI	001	015	True is the saying, and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief.
054	1TI	001	016	But for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me especially Christ Jesus might show forth all his long-suffering, as an example to those who should hereafter believe in him to life everlasting.
054	1TI	001	017	Now to the King eternal, the imperishable, invisible, only God, be honor and glory for ever and ever. Amen.
054	1TI	001	018	This charge I commit to thee, my child Timothy, in accordance with the directions of the prophets before given to thee, that thou mayst in them war the good warfare,
054	1TI	001	019	having faith, and a good conscience, which some thrusting away made shipwreck concerning the faith;
054	1TI	001	020	of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I delivered to Satan, that they might be taught not to blaspheme.
054	1TI	002	001	I exhort then, first of all, that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks be made for all men;
054	1TI	002	002	for kings, and all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and tranquil life in all godliness and propriety.
054	1TI	002	003	For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour,
054	1TI	002	004	whose will is that all men should be saved, and come to the knowledge of the truth.
054	1TI	002	005	For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,
054	1TI	002	006	who gave himself a ransom for all; to which the testimony was to be borne in its own due times,
054	1TI	002	007	whereunto I was appointed a herald and an apostle, (I speak the truth, I lie not, ) a teacher of the gentiles in faith and truth.
054	1TI	002	008	I desire, then, that the men pray in every place, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.
054	1TI	002	009	In like manner also, that women, in seemly attire, adorn themselves with modesty and sobriety, not with braided hair, and gold, or pearls, or costly apparel;
054	1TI	002	010	but, as becometh women professing godliness, with good works.
054	1TI	002	011	Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.
054	1TI	002	012	But I suffer not the woman to teach, nor to have authority over the man, but to be in silence.
054	1TI	002	013	For Adam was first formed, then Eve.
054	1TI	002	014	And Adam was not deceived; but the woman being deceived fell into transgression.
054	1TI	002	015	But she will be saved through child-bearing, if they continue in faith, and love, and holiness, with sobriety.
054	1TI	003	001	True is the saying: If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work.
054	1TI	003	002	A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, sober, discreet, orderly, hospitable, apt in teaching;
054	1TI	003	003	not given to wine, not a striker, but forbearing, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money;
054	1TI	003	004	presiding well over his own house, having his children in subjection with all propriety; —
054	1TI	003	005	for if a man knoweth not how to preside over his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God—
054	1TI	003	006	not a new convert, lest being puffed up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the Devil;
054	1TI	003	007	moreover he must also have a good report from them that are without, lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the Devil.
054	1TI	003	008	Deacons in like manner must be grave, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of base gain,
054	1TI	003	009	holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.
054	1TI	003	010	And let these also first be proved; then let them serve as deacons, if they are without reproach.
054	1TI	003	011	The women in like manner must be grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful in all things.
054	1TI	003	012	Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well.
054	1TI	003	013	For they that have served well as deacons, gain for themselves a good standing, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.
054	1TI	003	014	These things write I to thee, hoping to come to thee shortly;
054	1TI	003	015	but if I should tarry long, that thou mayst know how thou oughtest to conduct thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and foundation of the truth.
054	1TI	003	016	And confessedly great is the mystery of godliness, in him who was manifested in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen by angels, preached among the gentiles, believed on in the world, received up in glory.
054	1TI	004	001	Now the Spirit saith expressly, that in the latter times some will depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and teachings of demons,
054	1TI	004	002	through the hypocrisy of speakers of lies, who bear a brand on their own conscience,
054	1TI	004	003	forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from food which God created to be received with thanksgiving, for those who believe and know the truth.
054	1TI	004	004	For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving;
054	1TI	004	005	for it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.
054	1TI	004	006	If thou lay these things before the brethren, thou wilt be a good minister of Christ Jesus, nourished in the words of the faith, and of the good teaching, with which thou art well acquainted.
054	1TI	004	007	But avoid the profane and old wives' fables; and exercise thyself unto godliness.
054	1TI	004	008	For bodily exercise is profitable for little; but godliness is profitable for all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.
054	1TI	004	009	True is the saying, and worthy of all acceptance.
054	1TI	004	010	For to this end we both labor and suffer reproach, because we have placed our hope in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, especially of believers.
054	1TI	004	011	These things command and teach.
054	1TI	004	012	Let no one despise thy youth, but become an example to the believers, in word, in behavior, in love, in faith, in purity.
054	1TI	004	013	Till I come, give attention to reading, to exhortation, to teaching.
054	1TI	004	014	Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.
054	1TI	004	015	Meditate on these things, give thyself wholly to them; that thy progress may be manifest to all.
054	1TI	004	016	Give heed to thyself, and to thy teaching; continue in them; for in doing this thou wilt save both thyself and them that hear thee.
054	1TI	005	001	Do not sharply rebuke an aged man, but exhort him as a father; the younger men, as brethren;
054	1TI	005	002	the elder women, as mothers; the younger, as sisters, with all purity.
054	1TI	005	003	Honor as widows those that are widows indeed.
054	1TI	005	004	But if any widow have children or grandchildren, let them learn first to show piety to their own family, and to requite their parents; for this is acceptable before God.
054	1TI	005	005	Now she that is a widow indeed, and left alone, hath set her hope on God, and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day;
054	1TI	005	006	but she that giveth herself up to pleasure is dead while she liveth.
054	1TI	005	007	These things also enjoin, that they may be blameless.
054	1TI	005	008	But if any one provideth not for his own, and especially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an unbeliever.
054	1TI	005	009	Let a widow be put on the list when not less than sixty years old, having been the wife of one husband,
054	1TI	005	010	well reported of for good works; if she have brought up children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints' feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every good work.
054	1TI	005	011	But younger widows refuse; for when they become wanton against Christ, they desire to marry;
054	1TI	005	012	falling into condemnation, because they have cast off their first faith;
054	1TI	005	013	and withal they learn to be idle, going about from house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also, and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not.
054	1TI	005	014	I desire therefore that the younger widows marry, bear children, guide the house, give no occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully.
054	1TI	005	015	For some have already turned aside after Satan.
054	1TI	005	016	If any man or woman that is a believer have widows, let them relieve them, and let not the church be burdened, that it may relieve those that are widows indeed.
054	1TI	005	017	Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honor; especially they who labor in the word and in teaching.
054	1TI	005	018	For the Scripture saith, “Thou shalt not muzzle the ox while he is treading out the grain”; and, “The laborer is worthy of his wages.”
054	1TI	005	019	Against an elder receive not an accusation without two or three witnesses.
054	1TI	005	020	Those that sin rebuke before all, that the rest also may fear.
054	1TI	005	021	I charge thee before God and Christ Jesus and the elect angels, that thou observe these things without prejudging, doing nothing with partiality.
054	1TI	005	022	Lay hands hastily on no one, neither share in other men's sins. Keep thyself pure.
054	1TI	005	023	No longer drink water only, but use a little wine for thy stomach's sake, and thy frequent infirmities.
054	1TI	005	024	Some men's sins are openly manifest, going before them to judgment; and some men they follow after.
054	1TI	005	025	In like manner also the good works of some are openly manifest; and those that are otherwise cannot be hid.
054	1TI	006	001	Let all who are under the yoke as bond-servants count their own masters worthy of all honor, that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed.
054	1TI	006	002	And they that have believing masters, let them not despise them because they are brethren; but rather do them service, because they who receive the benefit are faithful and beloved. These things teach and exhort.
054	1TI	006	003	If any one teacheth other doctrine, and assenteth not to sound words, the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness,
054	1TI	006	004	he is puffed up with pride, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words, from which cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings,
054	1TI	006	005	incessant disputings of men corrupted in their minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that godliness is gain.
054	1TI	006	006	But godliness with contentment is great gain.
054	1TI	006	007	For we brought nothing into the world; and it is certain we can carry nothing out.
054	1TI	006	008	If we have, then, food and raiment, we will be therewith content.
054	1TI	006	009	But they who desire to be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.
054	1TI	006	010	For the love of money is a root of all evils; which some coveting have strayed away from the faith, and have pierced themselves through with many pangs.
054	1TI	006	011	But do thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.
054	1TI	006	012	Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on everlasting life, to which thou wast called, and didst profess the good profession before many witnesses.
054	1TI	006	013	I charge thee before God, who giveth life to all things, and before Christ Jesus, who under Pontius Pilate testified the good profession,
054	1TI	006	014	that thou keep the commandment without spot, without reproach, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ,
054	1TI	006	015	which in his own times he shall show, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords,
054	1TI	006	016	who only hath immortality, dwelling in light unapproachable, whom no man hath seen, or can see; to whom be honor and power everlasting. Amen.
054	1TI	006	017	Charge those who are rich in this world that they be not high-minded, nor place their hope in uncertain riches, but in God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy; that they do good,
054	1TI	006	018	that they be rich in good works, liberal in imparting, willing to communicate,
054	1TI	006	019	laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on the true life.
054	1TI	006	020	O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding the profane babblings, and oppositions of the falsely-called knowledge;
054	1TI	006	021	which some professing, have erred concerning the faith. Grace be with thee.

# BOOK	055	2TI	2 Timothy	2 Timothy
055	2TI	001	001	Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus,
055	2TI	001	002	to Timothy, my beloved child: Grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
055	2TI	001	003	I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience, as without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day,
055	2TI	001	004	longing to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy;
055	2TI	001	005	when I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that it dwelleth in thee also.
055	2TI	001	006	For which cause I remind thee to stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the laying on of my hands;
055	2TI	001	007	for God gave us not the spirit of cowardice, but of power, and of love, and of admonition.
055	2TI	001	008	Be not then ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner; but endure hardship with me for the gospel through the power of God,
055	2TI	001	009	who saved us, and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and the grace which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,
055	2TI	001	010	but is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Christ Jesus, who abolished death, and brought life and incorruption to light through the gospel,
055	2TI	001	011	for which I was appointed a herald, and an apostle, and a teacher of the gentiles.
055	2TI	001	012	For which cause I suffer also these things. But I am not ashamed; for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which he hath committed to me unto that day.
055	2TI	001	013	Hold the pattern of sound words, which thou heardest from me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus;
055	2TI	001	014	the good trust committed to thee keep through the Holy Spirit which dwelleth in us.
055	2TI	001	015	Thou knowest this, that all those in Asia turned away from me, of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.
055	2TI	001	016	The Lord give mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, because he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain; but on the contrary,
055	2TI	001	017	when he arrived at Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found me.
055	2TI	001	018	The Lord grant to him that he may find mercy from the Lord in that day: and what services he rendered me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well.
055	2TI	002	001	Thou therefore, my child, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus;
055	2TI	002	002	and the things which thou didst hear from me before many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, such as will be able to teach others also.
055	2TI	002	003	Endure hardship with me as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.
055	2TI	002	004	No one serving as a soldier entangleth himself with the affairs of life, that he may please him who chose him to be a soldier.
055	2TI	002	005	And if a man contendeth in the games, he is not crowned, unless he contendeth lawfully.
055	2TI	002	006	The husbandman that laboreth must be the first partaker of the fruits.
055	2TI	002	007	Understand what I say; for the Lord will give thee apprehension in all things.
055	2TI	002	008	Bear in mind Jesus Christ of the seed of David, as raised from the dead, according to my gospel;
055	2TI	002	009	in which I suffer hardship even unto bonds as an evil-doer; but the word of God is not bound.
055	2TI	002	010	For this cause I endure all things for the sake of the elect, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus, with everlasting glory.
055	2TI	002	011	True is the saying: for if we died with him, we shall also live with him;
055	2TI	002	012	if we endure, we shall also reign with him; if we deny him, he also will deny us;
055	2TI	002	013	if we are faithless, he remaineth faithful; for he cannot deny himself.
055	2TI	002	014	Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the Lord not to carry on a strife of words, to no useful purpose, but rather to the subverting of the hearers.
055	2TI	002	015	Study to present thyself approved unto God, a workman not ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.
055	2TI	002	016	But shun the profane babblings; for they will go on to a higher degree of ungodliness;
055	2TI	002	017	and their word will eat as doth a canker; of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus,
055	2TI	002	018	who have erred concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection hath already taken place, and overthrow the faith of some.
055	2TI	002	019	Nevertheless God's firm foundation standeth, having this seal, “The Lord knoweth them that are his;” and, “Let every one that nameth the name of the Lord depart from iniquity.”
055	2TI	002	020	But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also wooden and earthen ones; and some for honor, and some for dishonor.
055	2TI	002	021	If then any one shall purge himself from these, he will be a vessel for honor, hallowed, useful for the householder, prepared for every good work.
055	2TI	002	022	But flee youthful lusts, and follow righteousness, faith, love, peace, with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.
055	2TI	002	023	But the foolish and ignorant questionings avoid, knowing that they gender quarrels;
055	2TI	002	024	and a servant of the Lord must not quarrel, but be gentle to all, apt in teaching, patient of wrong,
055	2TI	002	025	in meekness admonishing those that oppose themselves; if haply God may give them repentance to attain the full knowledge of the truth,
055	2TI	002	026	and they may awake to their senses out of the snare of the Devil, by whom they have been taken captive to do his will.
055	2TI	003	001	But know this, that in the last days grievous times will come.
055	2TI	003	002	For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without
055	2TI	003	003	natural affection, implacable, slanderers, incontinent, fierce, without love for what is good,
055	2TI	003	004	betrayers, headstrong, puffed up, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God;
055	2TI	003	005	having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof. And from these turn away.
055	2TI	003	006	For of these are they who creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away by divers lusts,
055	2TI	003	007	ever learning, and never able to come to the full knowledge of the truth.
055	2TI	003	008	Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so also do these withstand the truth; men corrupted in their minds, reprobate concerning the faith.
055	2TI	003	009	But they will proceed no further; for their folly will be clearly manifest to all, as that of those men was.
055	2TI	003	010	But thou art well acquainted with my teaching, manner of life, purpose, faith, long-suffering, love, patience,
055	2TI	003	011	persecutions, sufferings; what things came upon me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured, and out of them all the Lord delivered me.
055	2TI	003	012	Yea, and all that desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution.
055	2TI	003	013	But evil men and impostors will wax worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.
055	2TI	003	014	But do thou continue in the things which thou didst learn and wast assured of, knowing from what teachers thou didst learn them,
055	2TI	003	015	and that from a child thou hast known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation, through faith which is in Christ Jesus.
055	2TI	003	016	All Scripture is inspired by God, and is profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for discipline in righteousness;
055	2TI	003	017	that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto every good work.
055	2TI	004	001	I charge thee before God, and Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom;
055	2TI	004	002	preach the word, be urgent in season, out of season, confute, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering and teaching.
055	2TI	004	003	For the time will come, when they will not endure sound doctrine, but after their own desires will they heap to themselves teachers; because they have itching ears;
055	2TI	004	004	and they will turn away their ears from the truth, and turn aside to fables.
055	2TI	004	005	But be thou watchful in all things, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fully accomplish thy ministry.
055	2TI	004	006	For I am already about to be offered as a sacrifice, and the time of my departure is at hand.
055	2TI	004	007	I have fought the good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith;
055	2TI	004	008	henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will give to me at that day, and not to me only, but to all those who have loved his appearing.
055	2TI	004	009	Use diligence to come to me shortly.
055	2TI	004	010	For Demas forsook me, because he loved the present world, and went to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.
055	2TI	004	011	Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee; for he is useful to me for the ministry.
055	2TI	004	012	But Tychicus I sent to Ephesus.
055	2TI	004	013	The cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest bring with thee, and the books, especially the parchments.
055	2TI	004	014	Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil; the Lord will reward him according to his works;
055	2TI	004	015	of whom do thou also beware; for he hath greatly withstood our words.
055	2TI	004	016	At my first defence no one came forward with me, but all forsook me. May it not be laid to their charge!
055	2TI	004	017	But the Lord stood by me, and strengthened me, that the preaching might be fully accomplished by me, and that all the gentiles might hear; and I was delivered out of the lion's mouth.
055	2TI	004	018	The Lord will deliver me from every evil deed, and preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom; to whom be the glory for ever and ever. Amen.
055	2TI	004	019	Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.
055	2TI	004	020	Erastus remained at Corinth, but Trophimus I left at Miletus sick.
055	2TI	004	021	Use diligence to come before winter. Eubulus saluteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.
055	2TI	004	022	The Lord be with thy spirit. Grace be with you.

# BOOK	056	TIT	Titus	Titus
056	TIT	001	001	Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Christ Jesus, for the faith of God's elect, and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness,
056	TIT	001	002	in hope of everlasting life, which God, who cannot lie, promised from the most ancient times,
056	TIT	001	003	but in his own seasons manifested his word through the preaching with which I was intrusted by the commandment of God our Saviour:
056	TIT	001	004	to Titus, true child after the common faith: Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Saviour.
056	TIT	001	005	For this cause I left thee behind in Crete, that thou shouldst set in order the things that are wanting, and appoint elders in every city, as I directed thee;
056	TIT	001	006	if any one is without reproach, the husband of one wife, having believing children, that are not accused of dissoluteness, or unruly.
056	TIT	001	007	For a bishop must be without reproach, as God's steward; not self-willed, not soon angry, not given to wine, not a striker, not greedy of base gain,
056	TIT	001	008	but hospitable, a lover of what is good, discreet, just, holy, temperate,
056	TIT	001	009	holding fast the sure word according to what he was taught, that he may be able by sound teaching both to exhort, and to refute the gainsayers.
056	TIT	001	010	For there are many unruly vain talkers and deceivers, especially they of the circumcision;
056	TIT	001	011	whose mouths must be stopped, since they overturn whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for the sake of base gain.
056	TIT	001	012	One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said: “The Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, slothful gluttons.”
056	TIT	001	013	This testimony is true; for which cause rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,
056	TIT	001	014	not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men who turn away from the truth.
056	TIT	001	015	To the pure all things are pure; but to the defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure, but both their mind and conscience are defiled.
056	TIT	001	016	They profess that they know God, but by their works they deny him, being abominable and disobedient, and for every good work reprobate.
056	TIT	002	001	But do thou speak the things which become sound teaching;
056	TIT	002	002	that aged men be sober, grave, discreet, sound in faith, in love, in patience;
056	TIT	002	003	that aged women likewise be in behavior as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not enslaved to much wine, teachers of what is good,
056	TIT	002	004	that they may teach the young women to love their husbands, to love their children,
056	TIT	002	005	to be discreet, chaste, workers at home, good, in subjection to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.
056	TIT	002	006	The younger men likewise exhort to be sober-minded;
056	TIT	002	007	in all things showing thyself a pattern of good works, in teaching showing uncorruptness, gravity,
056	TIT	002	008	sound speech that cannot be condemned; that he that is opposed to us may be put to shame, having no evil thing to say of us.
056	TIT	002	009	Exhort bond-servants to be in subjection to their own masters, in all things to be well-pleasing to them,
056	TIT	002	010	not contradicting, not purloining, but showing all good faith; that they may adorn the teaching of God our Saviour in all things.
056	TIT	002	011	For the grace of God, that bringeth salvation to all men, was manifested,
056	TIT	002	012	teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in the present world;
056	TIT	002	013	looking for the blessed hope, and appearing of the glory of the great God and of our Saviour Jesus Christ;
056	TIT	002	014	who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify to himself a people to be his own, zealous in good works.
056	TIT	002	015	These things speak and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no one despise thee.
056	TIT	003	001	Put them in mind to submit themselves to governments, to authorities, to obey magistrates, to be ready for every good work,
056	TIT	003	002	to speak evil of no one, to be averse to strife, forbearing, showing all meekness to all men.
056	TIT	003	003	For we ourselves also were once foolish, disobedient, going astray, slaves to divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, hating one another.
056	TIT	003	004	But when the kindness and love for men of God our Saviour appeared,
056	TIT	003	005	not by works of righteousness which we did, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the bath of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Spirit,
056	TIT	003	006	which he poured out upon us richly through Jesus Christ our Saviour,
056	TIT	003	007	that having been accepted as righteous by his grace, we might become heirs according to the hope of everlasting life.
056	TIT	003	008	True is the saying; and these things I desire that thou affirm earnestly, that they who have believed in God may be careful to practise good works. These things are good and profitable to men;
056	TIT	003	009	but avoid foolish questionings, and genealogies, and strifes, and contentions about the Law; for they are unprofitable and vain.
056	TIT	003	010	A man that stirs up divisions, after a first and second admonition, avoid;
056	TIT	003	011	knowing that he that is such is utterly perverted, and sinneth, being self-condemned.
056	TIT	003	012	When I shall have sent Artemas to thee, or Tychicus, use diligence to come to me to Nicopolis; for there I have determined to pass the winter.
056	TIT	003	013	Zenas the lawyer and Apollos forward on their journey diligently, that nothing may be wanting to them.
056	TIT	003	014	And let those also who belong to us learn to practise good works for the necessary wants that arise, that they may not be unfruitful.
056	TIT	003	015	All that are with me salute thee. Salute those who love us in the faith. Grace be with you all.

057	PHM	001	001	Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy the brother, to Philemon our beloved friend and fellow-laborer,
057	PHM	001	002	and to the beloved Apphia, and to Archippus our fellow-soldier, and to the church in thy house:
057	PHM	001	003	Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
057	PHM	001	004	I thank my God at all times, making mention of thee in my prayers,
057	PHM	001	005	hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus and toward all the saints;
057	PHM	001	006	that the fellowship of thy faith may become effectual in the knowledge of every good thing which is in us, for Christ Jesus.
057	PHM	001	007	For we have great thankfulness and comfort on account of thy love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed by thee, brother.
057	PHM	001	008	Wherefore, though I have much boldness in Christ to enjoin upon thee that which is befitting,
057	PHM	001	009	yet for love's sake I beseech thee rather; being such a one as Paul an old man, and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus,
057	PHM	001	010	I beseech thee for my child, whom I begot in my bonds, Onesimus;
057	PHM	001	011	who in time past was unprofitable to thee, but is now profitable to thee and to me;
057	PHM	001	012	whom I have sent back; and do thou [[receive]] him, that is, my own flesh.
057	PHM	001	013	Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might minister to me in the bonds of the gospel;
057	PHM	001	014	but I chose to do nothing without thy consent, that thy benefit may be not as from necessity, but willingly.
057	PHM	001	015	For perhaps he was separated from thee for a season to this end, that thou shouldst receive him back as thine for ever;
057	PHM	001	016	no longer as a bond-servant, but above a bond-servant, a brother beloved, especially to me, but how much more to thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord!
057	PHM	001	017	If thou then regardest me as a partner, receive him as myself.
057	PHM	001	018	And if he wronged thee in anything, or oweth thee, put that to my account.
057	PHM	001	019	I Paul have written it with my own hand, I will repay it; not to say to thee, that to me thou owest even thy own self besides.
057	PHM	001	020	Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ.
057	PHM	001	021	Having confidence in thy obedience I have written to thee, knowing that thou wilt do even more than I say.
057	PHM	001	022	And at the same time make ready a lodging for me; for I hope that through your prayers I shall be granted to you.
057	PHM	001	023	Epaphras, my fellow-prisoner in Christ Jesus,
057	PHM	001	024	Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow-laborers, salute thee.
057	PHM	001	025	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.

# BOOK	058	HEB	Hebrews	Hebrews
058	HEB	001	001	God, who at different times and in different ways spoke of old to the fathers by the prophets,
058	HEB	001	002	hath at the end of these days spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, by whom he also made the worlds,
058	HEB	001	003	who being a brightness from his glory and an image of his being, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself accomplished a cleansing of sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;
058	HEB	001	004	having become so much superior to the angels, as he hath inherited a more excellent name than they.
058	HEB	001	005	For to which of the angels did he ever say: “Thou art my Son, I this day have begotten thee?” and again: “I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?”
058	HEB	001	006	And again, when he hath brought in the first-begotten into the world, he saith: “And let all the angels of God pay him homage.”
058	HEB	001	007	And of the angels he saith: “Who maketh his angels winds, and his ministers a flame of fire;”
058	HEB	001	008	but of the Son: “Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever; and the sceptre of thy kingdom is a sceptre of righteousness.
058	HEB	001	009	Thou lovedst righteousness, and hatedst iniquity; therefore God, thy God, anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.”
058	HEB	001	010	And: “Thou, Lord, in the beginning didst found the earth, and the heavens are the works of thy hands.
058	HEB	001	011	They will perish, but thou remainest; and they will all become old as doth a garment,
058	HEB	001	012	and thou wilt fold them up as a vesture, and they will be changed; but thou art the same, and thy years will not fail.”
058	HEB	001	013	But to which of the angels hath he ever said: “Sit on my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool?”
058	HEB	001	014	Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for the sake of those who are to inherit salvation?
058	HEB	002	001	Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest haply we let them slip.
058	HEB	002	002	For if the word spoken through angels proved steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just retribution,
058	HEB	002	003	how shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation, which at the first was spoken through the Lord, and was confirmed to us through those who heard him,
058	HEB	002	004	God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Spirit, according to his will?
058	HEB	002	005	For not to angels did he put in subjection the world to come, of which we are speaking.
058	HEB	002	006	But one in a certain place bore testimony, saying, “What is man, that thou art mindful of him, or the son of man, that thou carest for him?
058	HEB	002	007	Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him with glory and honor;
058	HEB	002	008	thou didst put all things in subjection under his feet.” For in that he put all things in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him. But now we do not yet see all things put under him.
058	HEB	002	009	But we see him who was made a little lower than the angels, Jesus, on account of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor; that by the grace of God he might taste death for every one.
058	HEB	002	010	For it became him, for whom are all things, and through whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the author of their salvation perfect through sufferings.
058	HEB	002	011	For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one; for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren;
058	HEB	002	012	saying, “I will declare thy name to my brethren, in the midst of the congregation will I sing praise to thee.”
058	HEB	002	013	And again, “I will put my trust in him;” and again, “Behold, I, and the children which God gave me.”
058	HEB	002	014	Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself in like manner shared in the same, that through death he might bring to nought him who had the power of death, that is, the Devil,
058	HEB	002	015	and might deliver those who, through fear of death, were all their life-time subject to bondage.
058	HEB	002	016	For surely he doth not help angels, but he helpeth the offspring of Abraham.
058	HEB	002	017	Whence it was right for him to be in all respects made like to his brethren, that he might become a merciful and faithful high-priest in things pertaining to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people.
058	HEB	002	018	For in that he himself hath suffered, being tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted.
058	HEB	003	001	Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the apostle and high-priest of our profession, Jesus;
058	HEB	003	002	who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also was Moses in all his house.
058	HEB	003	003	For he hath been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as greater than the house is he who built it.
058	HEB	003	004	For every house is builded by some one; but he who built all things is God.
058	HEB	003	005	And Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, that he might testify of those things which were to be spoken;
058	HEB	003	006	but Christ as a son over his house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and joyousness of our hope.
058	HEB	003	007	Wherefore, as the Holy Spirit saith: “To-day, if ye hear his voice,
058	HEB	003	008	harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of the temptation in the wilderness,
058	HEB	003	009	where your fathers tempted me by proving me, and saw my works forty years.
058	HEB	003	010	Wherefore I was offended with that generation, and said, They always err in their heart, but they knew not my ways;
058	HEB	003	011	so I swore in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.”
058	HEB	003	012	Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any one of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.
058	HEB	003	013	But exhort one another daily, as long as it is called To-day, that none of you may be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.
058	HEB	003	014	For we have become partakers of Christ, if we hold fast our first confidence firm to the end.
058	HEB	003	015	When it is said, “To-day, if ye hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation,”
058	HEB	003	016	who then, when they had heard, provoked? Was it not all who came out of Egypt by means of Moses?
058	HEB	003	017	And with whom was he offended forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness?
058	HEB	003	018	And to whom did he swear that they should not enter into his rest, except to those who were disobedient?
058	HEB	003	019	So then we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.
058	HEB	004	001	Let us then fear, since a promise is still left us of entering into his rest, lest any one of you should appear to fail of obtaining it.
058	HEB	004	002	For to us were glad tidings addressed, as well as to them; but the word which was heard did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in those who heard it.
058	HEB	004	003	For we who believed enter into the rest, as he hath said: “So I swore in my wrath, they shall not enter into my rest;” although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.
058	HEB	004	004	For he hath spoken in a certain place of the seventh day thus: “And God rested on the seventh day from all his works;”
058	HEB	004	005	and in this place again: “They shall not enter into my rest.”
058	HEB	004	006	Since then it still remaineth for some to enter into it, and they to whom the glad tidings of it were first brought did not enter in because of disobedience,
058	HEB	004	007	he again appointeth a certain day, “To-day”—saying in David so long a time after, as hath before been said—”To-day, if ye hear his voice, harden not your hearts.”
058	HEB	004	008	For if Joshua had given them rest, he would not after this be speaking of another day.
058	HEB	004	009	There remaineth therefore a sabbath-rest to the people of God.
058	HEB	004	010	For he that hath entered into his rest, hath himself rested from his works, as God did from his own.
058	HEB	004	011	Let us then strive to enter into that rest, that no one may fall, as a like example of disobedience.
058	HEB	004	012	For the word of God is living, and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, both the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart;
058	HEB	004	013	and there is no creature that is not manifest in his sight; but all things are naked and laid open to the eyes of him with whom we have to do.
058	HEB	004	014	Since, then, we have a great high-priest, who hath passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.
058	HEB	004	015	For we have not a high-priest who cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but one who hath in all points been tempted as we are, without sin.
058	HEB	004	016	Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.
058	HEB	005	001	For every high-priest, being taken from among men, is appointed for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins;
058	HEB	005	002	being able to be forbearing toward the ignorant and the erring, since he himself also is compassed with infirmity;
058	HEB	005	003	and by reason of this infirmity he must, as for the people, so also for himself, offer sacrifice for sins.
058	HEB	005	004	And no one taketh this honor to himself, but when called by God, as was Aaron.
058	HEB	005	005	Thus Christ did not glorify himself to be made high-priest, but he who said to him, “Thou art my Son, I this day have begotten thee;”
058	HEB	005	006	as also he saith in another place, “Thou art a priest for ever, after the order of Melchizedek.”
058	HEB	005	007	Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications, with strong crying and tears, to him that was able to save him from death, and was heard by reason of his godly reverence,
058	HEB	005	008	though a son yet learned his obedience from what he suffered;
058	HEB	005	009	and being perfected became the author of everlasting salvation to all who obey him,
058	HEB	005	010	being addressed by God as high-priest after the order of Melchizedek.
058	HEB	005	011	Of whom we have much to say, and hard to be explained, seeing ye have become dull of hearing.
058	HEB	005	012	For while on account of the length of time ye ought to be teachers, ye again have need that some one should teach you the first elements of the oracles of God, and are become such as have need of milk, and not of solid food.
058	HEB	005	013	For every one that feedeth on milk is unacquainted with the word of righteousness; for he is a babe;
058	HEB	005	014	but solid food belongs to those who are of full age, who by use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.
058	HEB	006	001	Let us then, leaving the first principles of the doctrine of Christ, press on to perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,
058	HEB	006	002	of the doctrine of baptisms, and of the laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of everlasting judgment.
058	HEB	006	003	And this we will do, if God permit.
058	HEB	006	004	For it is impossible that those who have once been enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and been make partakers of the Holy Spirit,
058	HEB	006	005	and have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,
058	HEB	006	006	and have fallen away, should again be renewed to repentance, since they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to open shame.
058	HEB	006	007	For the earth which hath drunk in the rain that cometh often upon it, and beareth plants useful to those for whose sake it is tilled, receiveth blessing from God;
058	HEB	006	008	but if it bear thorns and briers it is disapproved, and is near to being accursed; and its end is to be burned.
058	HEB	006	009	But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that are connected with salvation, though we do thus speak.
058	HEB	006	010	For God is not unjust so as to forget your work, and the love which ye showed toward his name, in that ye ministered and are still ministering to the saints.
058	HEB	006	011	But we earnestly desire that every one of you may show the same diligence with regard to the full assurance of your hope even to the end;
058	HEB	006	012	that ye may not become slothful, but imitators of those who through faith and endurance inherit the promises.
058	HEB	006	013	For when God made a promise to Abraham, since he could swear by no greater, he swore by himself,
058	HEB	006	014	saying, “Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee.”
058	HEB	006	015	And so, having endured with patience, he obtained the promised blessing.
058	HEB	006	016	For men indeed swear by one who is greater, and the oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife.
058	HEB	006	017	Wherefore God, wishing more abundantly to show to the heirs of the promise the immutability of his purpose, confirmed it by an oath,
058	HEB	006	018	that by two immutable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we may have strong encouragement, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us;
058	HEB	006	019	which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, sure and steadfast, and which entereth within the veil;
058	HEB	006	020	where as forerunner for us Jesus entered, having become a high-priest for ever, after the order of Melchizedek.
058	HEB	007	001	For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him,
058	HEB	007	002	to whom also Abraham apportioned a tenth part of all, who by interpretation is first King of righteousness, and then also was King of Salem, which is, King of peace,
058	HEB	007	003	without father, without mother, without record of descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life, but likened to the Son of God, remaineth a priest for ever.
058	HEB	007	004	Consider now how great this man was, to whom even Abraham the patriarch gave a tenth of the spoils.
058	HEB	007	005	And those indeed of the sons of Levi who receive the office of the priesthood have a command to take tithes of the people by the Law, that is, of their brethren, though they have come out of the loins of Abraham;
058	HEB	007	006	but he whose descent is not reckoned from them took tithes of Abraham, and blessed him who had the promises.
058	HEB	007	007	And beyond all contradiction the less is blessed by the greater.
058	HEB	007	008	And here indeed men that die receive tithes; but there he of whom it is testified that he liveth.
058	HEB	007	009	And so to speak, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, paid tithes in Abraham;
058	HEB	007	010	for he was yet in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him.
058	HEB	007	011	If indeed perfection had been by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people hath received the Law, ) what further need was there that a different priest should arise after the order of Melchizedek, and not be called alter the order of Aaron?
058	HEB	007	012	For if the priesthood is changed, there takes place of necessity a change of the law.
058	HEB	007	013	For he of whom these things are spoken belonged to another tribe, of which no one hath given attendance at the altar;
058	HEB	007	014	for it is well-known that our Lord sprang out of Judah, in regard to which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priests.
058	HEB	007	015	And it is still more abundantly evident, if after the likeness of Melchizedek there ariseth a different priest,
058	HEB	007	016	who hath been made, not according to the law of a fleshly commandment, but according to the power of an indissoluble life.
058	HEB	007	017	For it is testified of him, “Thou art a priest for ever, after the order of Melchizedek.”
058	HEB	007	018	For on the one hand there takes place an annulling of the commandment which went before, on account of its weakness and unprofitableness, —
058	HEB	007	019	for the Law perfected nothing, —and on the other, the bringing in of a better hope, by which we draw near to God.
058	HEB	007	020	And inasmuch as it was not without an oath that he was made priest,
058	HEB	007	021	—for they indeed have been made priests without an oath; but he with an oath by him who said to him, “The Lord swore, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever,”—
058	HEB	007	022	by so much hath Jesus become the surety of a better covenant.
058	HEB	007	023	And they indeed have been many priests, because they have been prevented from continuing by reason of death;
058	HEB	007	024	but he, because he abideth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood;
058	HEB	007	025	wherefore he is able also to save to the utmost those who come to God through him, since he ever liveth to make intercession for them.
058	HEB	007	026	For such a high-priest also became us, holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;
058	HEB	007	027	who hath not necessity daily, as the high-priests, to offer up sacrifice first for his own sins, and then for those of the people; for this he did once for all, when he offered up himself.
058	HEB	007	028	For the Law maketh men high-priests, who have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was after the Law, maketh the Son, who is perfected for ever.
058	HEB	008	001	Now the principal thing among those of which we are speaking is this: We have such a high-priest, who sat down on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;
058	HEB	008	002	a minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, not man.
058	HEB	008	003	For every high-priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices; whence it is necessary that this one also have something which he may offer.
058	HEB	008	004	For if, indeed, he were on earth, he would not be a priest, since there are those that offer the gifts according to the Law;
058	HEB	008	005	who serve the mere delineation and shadow of the heavenly things, as Moses was admonished by God when he was about to make the tabernacle; for, “See,” saith he, “that thou make all things according to the pattern which was shown thee in the mount.”
058	HEB	008	006	But now he hath obtained a more excellent ministry, in proportion as he is the mediator of a better covenant, which hath been established upon better promises.
058	HEB	008	007	For if that first covenant had been faultless, then a place would not have been sought for a second.
058	HEB	008	008	For finding fault with them, he saith: “Behold, the days are coming, saith the Lord, when I will make with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah a new covenant;
058	HEB	008	009	not according to the covenant which I made with their fathers, in the day when I took them by the hand, to bring them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.
058	HEB	008	010	For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord: I will put my laws into their mind, and on their hearts will I write them; and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people.
058	HEB	008	011	And they shall not teach every one his fellow-citizen, and every one his brother, saying, Know the Lord; for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest.
058	HEB	008	012	For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities I will remember no more.”
058	HEB	008	013	In that he saith, “a new covenant,” he hath made the first old; but that which is becoming old, and worn out with age, is ready to vanish away.
058	HEB	009	001	The first covenant, then, had indeed ordinances of religious service, and a worldly sanctuary.
058	HEB	009	002	For a tabernacle was prepared, the first, wherein was the candlestick, and the table, and the show-bread; which is called the holy place:
058	HEB	009	003	and after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the holy of holies,
058	HEB	009	004	which had the golden altar of incense, and the ark of the covenant overlaid on every side with gold, wherein was the golden pot containing the manna, and the rod of Aaron which budded, and the tables of the covenant;
058	HEB	009	005	and over it the cherubs of glory, overshadowing the mercy-seat; of which we cannot now speak particularly.
058	HEB	009	006	Now these things being thus prepared, into the first tabernacle indeed the priests enter at all times, performing the services;
058	HEB	009	007	but into the second the high-priest alone once every year, not without blood, which he offereth for himself, and for the errors of the people;
058	HEB	009	008	the Holy Spirit clearly showing this, that the way into the sanctuary hath not yet been made manifest, while the first tabernacle is yet standing:
058	HEB	009	009	which is a figure for the present time, in accordance with which are offered both gifts and sacrifices, which have no power as to the conscience to perfect the worshipper,
058	HEB	009	010	being only ordinances pertaining to the flesh, which in addition to meats and drinks and divers washings are imposed until the time of reformation.
058	HEB	009	011	But Christ having appeared, as a high-priest of the good things to come, passing through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is, not of this creation, entered once for all into the sanctuary,
058	HEB	009	012	not with the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood, and obtained for us everlasting redemption.
058	HEB	009	013	For if the blood of goats and bulls, and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who have been defiled, sanctify to the purifying of the flesh,
058	HEB	009	014	how much more shall the blood of Christ, who by his everlasting spirit offered himself without spot to God, purify your conscience from dead works, for the worship of the living God!
058	HEB	009	015	And for this cause he is the mediator of a new covenant, that, death having taken place for redemption from the transgressions under the first covenant, they who have been called may receive the everlasting inheritance which was promised.
058	HEB	009	016	For where there is a testament there must of necessity be implied the death of the testator;
058	HEB	009	017	for a testament is of force after men are dead, since it is of no force while the testator is living.
058	HEB	009	018	Hence neither was the first covenant ratified without blood.
058	HEB	009	019	For when Moses had spoken every precept according to the Law to all the people, he took the blood of the calves and of the goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,
058	HEB	009	020	saying, “This is the blood of the covenant which God enjoined in respect to you.”
058	HEB	009	021	The tabernacle also and all the vessels of the service he in like manner sprinkled with the blood.
058	HEB	009	022	And almost all things are according to the Law purified with blood, and without shedding of blood there is no remission.
058	HEB	009	023	It was necessary therefore that the copies of the things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with sacrifices better than these.
058	HEB	009	024	For Christ did not enter into a sanctuary made with hands, which is only a copy of the true one, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God in our behalf.
058	HEB	009	025	Nor yet to make an offering of himself many times, as the high-priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others;
058	HEB	009	026	for then must he have suffered many times since the foundation of the world; but now once in the end of the world he hath appeared, to put away sin by means of his sacrifice.
058	HEB	009	027	And as it is appointed to men once to die, but after this the judgment;
058	HEB	009	028	so also Christ having been once offered up to bear the sins of many, will appear the second time, without sin, for the salvation of those who are waiting for him.
058	HEB	010	001	For the Law but shadowing forth the good things to come, and not having the very image of the things, can never with the same sacrifices which they offer year by year continually make those who come with them perfect.
058	HEB	010	002	For in that case would they not have ceased to be offered, because the worshippers, having been once purified, would have had no more consciousness of sins?
058	HEB	010	003	But in these sacrifices there is a remembrance of sins every year.
058	HEB	010	004	For it is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins.
058	HEB	010	005	Wherefore, when he cometh into the world, he saith: “Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body didst thou prepare for me;
058	HEB	010	006	in whole burnt-offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hadst no pleasure.
058	HEB	010	007	Then said I, Lo, I have come—in the volume of the book it is written of me—to do thy will, O God.”
058	HEB	010	008	Saying above, “Sacrifices and offerings, and whole burnt-offerings and sacrifices for sin thou wouldest not, and hadst no pleasure in them,”—such as are offered in conformity to the Law, —
058	HEB	010	009	then hath he said, “Lo, I have come to do thy will.” He setteth aside the first, that he may establish the second.
058	HEB	010	010	And in this will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.
058	HEB	010	011	And every priest indeed standeth performing daily service, and offering again and again the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins;
058	HEB	010	012	but he, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins, sat down for ever on the right hand of God,
058	HEB	010	013	thenceforth waiting until his enemies be made his footstool.
058	HEB	010	014	For by one offering he hath perfected for ever those who are sanctified.
058	HEB	010	015	Moreover the Holy Spirit also is a witness to us of this. For after he had said,
058	HEB	010	016	“This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days,” the Lord saith, “I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them,
058	HEB	010	017	and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.”
058	HEB	010	018	But where there is remission of these, there is no longer offering for sin.
058	HEB	010	019	Having therefore, brethren, boldness for entrance into the sanctuary by the blood of Jesus,
058	HEB	010	020	a new and living way, which he consecrated for us, through the veil, that is, his flesh,
058	HEB	010	021	and having a great priest over the house of God,
058	HEB	010	022	let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having had our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience; and having had our bodies washed with pure water,
058	HEB	010	023	let us hold fast the profession of our hope without wavering, for he is faithful who promised;
058	HEB	010	024	and let us consider one another, to excite to love and to good works,
058	HEB	010	025	not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the custom of some is, but exhorting one another; and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.
058	HEB	010	026	For if we sin willingly after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remaineth a sacrifice for sins;
058	HEB	010	027	but a certain fearful looking for judgment, and an indignation by fire, which will devour the adversaries.
058	HEB	010	028	He that hath set at nought the law of Moses dieth without mercy under two or three witnesses;
058	HEB	010	029	of how much heavier punishment, think ye, will he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite to the Spirit of grace?
058	HEB	010	030	For we know him who said, “Vengeance belongeth to me, I will recompense, saith the Lord;” and again, “The Lord will judge his people.”
058	HEB	010	031	It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
058	HEB	010	032	But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were enlightened, ye endured a great struggle with sufferings;
058	HEB	010	033	partly, while ye were made a gazing-stock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, while ye became partakers with those that were so used.
058	HEB	010	034	For ye sympathized with those in bonds, and ye took joyfully the plundering of your goods, knowing that ye have for yourselves a better and an enduring substance.
058	HEB	010	035	Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompense of reward.
058	HEB	010	036	For ye have need of endurance; that, after ye have done the will of God, ye may receive what is promised.
058	HEB	010	037	For yet a very little while, and “he that is to come will come, and will not tarry.
058	HEB	010	038	Now my righteous man shall live by faith; but if he draw back, my soul hath no pleasure in him.”
058	HEB	010	039	But we are not of those who draw back, unto perdition; but of those who believe, to the saving of the soul.
058	HEB	011	001	Now faith is assurance of things hoped for, a conviction of things not seen.
058	HEB	011	002	For by it the elders obtained a good report.
058	HEB	011	003	Through faith we perceive that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that that which is seen hath not been made out of things which appear.
058	HEB	011	004	By faith Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, through which he received testimony that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts; and by it though dead he yet speaketh.
058	HEB	011	005	By faith Enoch was translated, that he should not see death; and he was not found, because God translated him; for before his translation he had the testimony that he pleased God.
058	HEB	011	006	But without faith it is impossible to please him; for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of those who diligently seek him.
058	HEB	011	007	By faith Noah, being warned by God of things not yet seen, moved with fear, prepared an ark for the saving of his house; by which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith.
058	HEB	011	008	By faith Abraham, when called, obeyed to go forth to a place which he was afterward to receive for an inheritance, and went forth, not knowing whither he was going.
058	HEB	011	009	By faith he sojourned in the land of the promise, as in a foreign country, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise;
058	HEB	011	010	for he was looking for the city which hath foundations, whose maker and builder is God.
058	HEB	011	011	Through faith Sarah herself also received power to conceive, even when she was past age, because she accounted him faithful who had promised.
058	HEB	011	012	Wherefore there sprang even from one, and him become as dead, a race like the stars of heaven in multitude, and like the sand by the seashore which cannot be numbered.
058	HEB	011	013	These all died in faith, not having received the promised blessings, but having seen them from afar, and greeted them, and having professed that they were strangers and sojourners on the earth.
058	HEB	011	014	For they who say such things show plainly that they are seeking a country.
058	HEB	011	015	And if indeed they had been mindful of that from which they came out, they would have had opportunity to return;
058	HEB	011	016	but now they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly. Wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God; for he prepared for them a city.
058	HEB	011	017	By faith Abraham, when tried, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises was offering up his only-begotten son,
058	HEB	011	018	he to whom it was said, “From Isaac shall thine offspring be reckoned;”
058	HEB	011	019	accounting that God is able even to raise from the dead; whence also he did figuratively receive him back.
058	HEB	011	020	By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau even concerning things to come.
058	HEB	011	021	By faith Jacob, when dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph; and worshipped, leaning upon the top of his staff.
058	HEB	011	022	By faith Joseph, when dying, made mention of the departure of the sons of Israel, and gave directions concerning his bones.
058	HEB	011	023	By faith Moses, when born, was hidden three months by his parents, because they saw that the child was fair and they feared not the king's commandment.
058	HEB	011	024	By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called son of Pharaoh's daughter,
058	HEB	011	025	choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;
058	HEB	011	026	esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt; for he looked to the recompense of reward.
058	HEB	011	027	By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; for he endured as seeing him who is invisible.
058	HEB	011	028	Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of the blood, that he who destroyed the first-born might not touch them.
058	HEB	011	029	By faith they passed through the Red Sea as through dry land; which the Egyptians attempted and were swallowed up.
058	HEB	011	030	By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they had been encompassed for seven days.
058	HEB	011	031	By faith Rahab the harlot did not perish with those who disobeyed, after having received the spies with peace.
058	HEB	011	032	And what shall I say more? For the time would fail me to tell of Gideon, of Barak, and Samson, and Jephthah, of David and Samuel, and the prophets;
058	HEB	011	033	who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promised blessings, stopped the mouths of lions,
058	HEB	011	034	quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, became mighty in war, put to flight the armies of the aliens.
058	HEB	011	035	Women received back their dead by a resurrection; but others were tortured, not accepting deliverance, that they might obtain a better resurrection;
058	HEB	011	036	and others had trial of mockings and scourgings, and also of bonds and imprisonment;
058	HEB	011	037	they were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword; they went about in sheep-skins and goat-skins, being destitute, afflicted, tormented,
058	HEB	011	038	of whom the world was not worthy; they wandered in deserts and mountains, and caves and the clefts of the earth.
058	HEB	011	039	And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promised blessing,
058	HEB	011	040	God having provided for us some better thing, that they might not be made perfect without us.
058	HEB	012	001	Therefore let us also, being surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth easily beset us, and let us run with perseverance the race that is set before us;
058	HEB	012	002	looking to the author and perfecter of the faith, Jesus, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and hath sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.
058	HEB	012	003	For consider him that endured such contradiction by sinners against him, lest ye faint in your souls, and become weary.
058	HEB	012	004	Not yet have ye resisted unto blood, in your contest against sin;
058	HEB	012	005	and ye have forgotten the exhortation, which reasoneth with you as with sons: “My son, despise not the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when reproved by him;
058	HEB	012	006	for whom the Lord loveth, he chasteneth; and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.”
058	HEB	012	007	It is for chastening that ye endure; God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he, whom the father chasteneth not?
058	HEB	012	008	But if ye are without chastening, of which all have been made partakers, then are ye bastards and not sons.
058	HEB	012	009	Furthermore, we were chastened by the fathers of our flesh, and we gave them reverence; shall we not much rather be in subjection to the Father of spirits, and live?
058	HEB	012	010	For they indeed for a few days chastened us, according as it seemed good to them; but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness.
058	HEB	012	011	Now all chastening for the present indeed seemeth to be not joyous, but grievous; but afterward it yieldeth the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been exercised thereby.
058	HEB	012	012	Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees;
058	HEB	012	013	and make straight paths for your feet, that the lame may not be turned out of the way, but may rather be healed.
058	HEB	012	014	Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no one will see the Lord;
058	HEB	012	015	looking diligently, lest any one come short of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and the many be thereby defiled;
058	HEB	012	016	lest there be any fornicator, or profane person as Esau, who for one meal sold even his birthright.
058	HEB	012	017	For ye know that when he afterward wished to inherit the blessing, he was rejected; for he found no place for repentance, though he sought it earnestly with tears.
058	HEB	012	018	For ye have not come to a mount that can be touched, and burning with fire, and to blackness, and darkness, and tempest,
058	HEB	012	019	and the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words, which voice they who heard, entreated that no more should be spoken to them;
058	HEB	012	020	for they could not bear that which was commanded, “If even a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned;” and,
058	HEB	012	021	so terrible was the sight, Moses said: “I exceedingly fear and tremble;”
058	HEB	012	022	but ye have come to Mount Zion, and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem; and to myriads, the general assembly of angels;
058	HEB	012	023	and to the church of the first-born, who are enrolled in heaven; and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of righteous men made perfect;
058	HEB	012	024	and to Jesus the mediator of a new covenant; and to a sprinkling with that blood which speaketh something better than Abel.
058	HEB	012	025	See that ye refuse not him who speaketh. For if they did not escape, who refused him who spoke his will on earth, much more shall not we, if we turn away from him who speaketh from heaven;
058	HEB	012	026	whose voice then shook the earth; but now he hath promised, saying, “Yet once more will I shake, not the earth only, but also the heaven.”
058	HEB	012	027	And this expression, “Yet once more,” signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that have been made, in order that those things which are not shaken may abide.
058	HEB	012	028	Wherefore receiving a kingdom which cannot be shaken, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably, with reverence and godly fear.
058	HEB	012	029	For our God is a consuming fire.
058	HEB	013	001	Let brotherly love continue.
058	HEB	013	002	Be not forgetful to entertain strangers; for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.
058	HEB	013	003	Remember those in bonds, as bound with them; those in distress, as being yourselves also in the body.
058	HEB	013	004	Let marriage be honored in all respects, and the bed be undefiled; but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.
058	HEB	013	005	Let your disposition be without covetousness, and be content with what ye have; for he hath said, “I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee;”
058	HEB	013	006	so that we boldly say, “The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear; what shall man do to me?”
058	HEB	013	007	Remember your leaders, who spoke to you the word of God; and considering well the end of their manner of life, imitate their faith.
058	HEB	013	008	Jesus Christ is yesterday and to-day the same, and for ever.
058	HEB	013	009	Be not carried aside with various and strange teachings; for it is good that the heart be established with grace, not with meats, in which those who walked were not profited.
058	HEB	013	010	We have an altar, of which they cannot eat who serve the tabernacle.
058	HEB	013	011	For the bodies of those beasts whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high-priest are burned without the camp.
058	HEB	013	012	Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people by his own blood, suffered without the gate.
058	HEB	013	013	Let us then go forth to him without the camp, bearing his reproach;
058	HEB	013	014	for here we have no abiding city, but are seeking that which is to come.
058	HEB	013	015	Through him therefore let us offer up a sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of lips giving thanks to his name.
058	HEB	013	016	But works of kindness and liberality forget not; for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.
058	HEB	013	017	Obey your leaders, and submit yourselves to them; for they keep watch in behalf of your souls, as those who must give an account; that they may do this with joy, and not with grief; for this is not for your advantage.
058	HEB	013	018	Pray for us; for we are persuaded that we have a good conscience, desiring in all things to conduct ourselves well;
058	HEB	013	019	but I the more earnestly entreat you to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner.
058	HEB	013	020	Now may the God of peace, who brought up from the dead the great Shepherd of the sheep through the blood of an everlasting covenant, even our Lord Jesus,
058	HEB	013	021	make you perfect in every good work, to do his will, doing in you that which is well-pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be the glory for ever. Amen.
058	HEB	013	022	But I beseech you, brethren, bear with the word of my exhortation; for I have written to you in few words.
058	HEB	013	023	Know that the brother Timothy hath been set at liberty, with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you.
058	HEB	013	024	Salute all your leaders, and all the saints. Those from Italy salute you.
058	HEB	013	025	Grace be with you all. Amen.

# BOOK	059	JAM	James	James
059	JAM	001	001	James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.
059	JAM	001	002	Count it all joy, my brethren, when ye fall into various temptations;
059	JAM	001	003	knowing that the trying of your faith worketh endurance.
059	JAM	001	004	But let endurance have a perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting in nothing.
059	JAM	001	005	But if any one of you is wanting in wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth to all liberally, and upbraideth not; and it will be given him.
059	JAM	001	006	But let him ask in faith, nothing doubting; for he that doubteth is like a wave of the sea driven by the wind and tossed.
059	JAM	001	007	For let not that man think that he shall receive anything from the Lord,
059	JAM	001	008	a double-minded man as he is, unstable in all his ways.
059	JAM	001	009	Let the brother of low degree glory in that he is exalted;
059	JAM	001	010	but the rich, in that he is made low; because as the flower of the grass he will pass away.
059	JAM	001	011	For the sun rose with its burning heat, and withered the grass, and its flower fell off, and the beauty of its appearance perished; so also will the rich man fade away in his ways.
059	JAM	001	012	Blessed is the man that endureth temptation; for when he is approved, he will receive the crown of life, which He promised to them that love him.
059	JAM	001	013	Let no one when he is tempted, say, I am tempted by God; for God cannot be tempted with evil, and he tempteth no one.
059	JAM	001	014	But each one is tempted when by his own lust he is led away and enticed;
059	JAM	001	015	then lust, having conceived, bringeth forth sin, and sin, when completed, bringeth forth death.
059	JAM	001	016	Do not err, my beloved brethren.
059	JAM	001	017	Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the lights, with whom is no change, nor shadow from turning.
059	JAM	001	018	Of his own will he begot us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of first-fruits of his creatures.
059	JAM	001	019	Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath.
059	JAM	001	020	For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.
059	JAM	001	021	Wherefore put off all filthiness, and excess of wickedness, and receive with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls.
059	JAM	001	022	But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves.
059	JAM	001	023	For if any one is a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like a man beholding his natural face in a glass;
059	JAM	001	024	for he beholds himself, and goes away, and immediately forgets what manner of man he was.
059	JAM	001	025	But he who looks into the perfect law of liberty, and remains there, being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man will be blessed in his deed.
059	JAM	001	026	If any one thinks that he is religious, and bridles not his tongue, but deceives his own heart, this man's religion is vain.
059	JAM	001	027	Pure religion and undefiled before God, the Father, is this, to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep one's self unspotted from the world.
059	JAM	002	001	My brethren, hold not the faith of our Lord of glory, Jesus Christ, with respect of persons.
059	JAM	002	002	For if there come into your assembly a man with a gold ring, in splendid apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment,
059	JAM	002	003	and ye have respect to him that weareth the splendid apparel, and say, Sit thou here in a good place, and say to the poor man, Stand thou there, or, Sit under my footstool,
059	JAM	002	004	have ye not been partial among yourselves, and become judges with evil thoughts?
059	JAM	002	005	Hearken, my beloved brethren. Did not God choose the poor as to the world to be rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he promised to them that love him?
059	JAM	002	006	but ye have despised the poor man. Do not the rich oppress you, and do not they drag you before the judgment-seats?
059	JAM	002	007	Do not they blaspheme the worthy name by which ye are called?
059	JAM	002	008	If indeed ye fulfill the royal law, according to the scripture, “Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself,” ye do well.
059	JAM	002	009	But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convicted by the law as transgressors.
059	JAM	002	010	For whoever hath kept the whole law, and yet hath offended in one point, hath become guilty of all.
059	JAM	002	011	For he who said, “Do not commit adultery,” said also, “Do not kill.” Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou hast become a transgressor of the law.
059	JAM	002	012	So speak, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.
059	JAM	002	013	For the judgment shall be without mercy to him that showed no mercy. Mercy glorieth against judgment.
059	JAM	002	014	What doth it profit, my brethren, if any one say that he hath faith, and have not works? Can his faith save him?
059	JAM	002	015	If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,
059	JAM	002	016	and one of you say to them, Depart in peace, be warmed and be filled, notwithstanding ye give them not the things needful for the body, what doth it profit?
059	JAM	002	017	So also faith, if it hath not works, is dead in itself.
059	JAM	002	018	But some one will say, Thou hast faith, and I have works; show me thy faith without works, and I will show thee my faith by my works.
059	JAM	002	019	Thou believest that God is one; thou doest well; the demons also believe, and tremble.
059	JAM	002	020	But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is idle?
059	JAM	002	021	Was not Abraham our father accepted as righteous through works, when he offered Isaac his son upon the altar?
059	JAM	002	022	Thou seest that faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect.
059	JAM	002	023	And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, “Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him for righteousness;” and he was called the friend of God.
059	JAM	002	024	Ye see that by works a man is accounted as righteous, and not by faith only.
059	JAM	002	025	And in like manner was not also Rahab the harlot accounted as righteous through works, when she received the messengers, and sent them out another way?
059	JAM	002	026	For as the body without the spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead.
059	JAM	003	001	My brethren, be not many teachers, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation.
059	JAM	003	002	For in many things we all offend. If any one offend not in speech, the same is a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body also.
059	JAM	003	003	For when we put the bits into the horses' mouths, that they may obey us, we turn about also their whole body.
059	JAM	003	004	Behold also the ships, which, though they are so great, and driven by fierce winds, are yet turned about with a very small rudder, whithersoever the steersman chooseth.
059	JAM	003	005	So also the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a forest a little fire kindleth!
059	JAM	003	006	And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity! The tongue among our members is that which defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the wheel of life, and is itself set on fire by hell.
059	JAM	003	007	For every kind of beasts and of birds, of creeping things and things in the sea, is tamed and hath been tamed by mankind;
059	JAM	003	008	but the tongue can no man tame; it is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.
059	JAM	003	009	Therewith bless we the Lord and Father, and therewith curse we men, who have been made after the likeness of God;
059	JAM	003	010	out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.
059	JAM	003	011	Doth a fountain from the same opening send forth sweet water and bitter?
059	JAM	003	012	Can a fig-tree, my brethren, bear olives, or a vine, figs? Neither can salt water yield fresh.
059	JAM	003	013	Who is wise and endued with knowledge among you P let him show out of a good course of conduct his works in meekness of wisdom.
059	JAM	003	014	But if ye have bitter rivalry and strife in your hearts, do not glory and lie against the truth.
059	JAM	003	015	This wisdom is not that which descendeth from above, but earthly, sensual, devilish.
059	JAM	003	016	For where there is rivalry and strife, there is confusion and every evil work.
059	JAM	003	017	But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, without hypocrisy.
059	JAM	003	018	And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.
059	JAM	004	001	Whence are wars and whence are fightings among you? Are they not hence, from your lusts that war in your members?
059	JAM	004	002	Ye lust, and have not; ye kill, and earnestly covet, and cannot obtain; ye fight and war. Ye have not, because ye ask not;
059	JAM	004	003	ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts.
059	JAM	004	004	Ye adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? Whoever therefore chooseth to be a friend of the world, becometh an enemy of God.
059	JAM	004	005	Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, “Zealously doth the Spirit, which made its abode in us, long for us”?
059	JAM	004	006	but he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, “God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble.”
059	JAM	004	007	Submit yourselves therefore to God; resist the Devil, and he will flee from you.
059	JAM	004	008	Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners, and purify your hearts, ye double-minded.
059	JAM	004	009	Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep; let your laughter be turned into mourning, and your joy into heaviness.
059	JAM	004	010	Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he will exalt you.
059	JAM	004	011	Speak not against one another, brethren; he that speaketh against his brother, or judgeth his brother, speaketh against the law, and judgeth the law; but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.
059	JAM	004	012	One is the Lawgiver and Judge, he who is able to save, and to destroy; but who art thou, that judgest thy neighbor?
059	JAM	004	013	Come now, ye that say, To-day and to-morrow we will go into such a city, and spend a year there and traffic, and get gain,
059	JAM	004	014	(whereas ye know not what will be on the morrow; for what is your life? Ye are even a vapor, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away; )
059	JAM	004	015	instead of saying, If the Lord will, we shall both live and do this or that;
059	JAM	004	016	but now ye glory in your boastings. All such glorying is evil.
059	JAM	004	017	Therefore to him that knoweth how to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.
059	JAM	005	001	Come now, ye rich men, weep and wail for your miseries that are coming upon you.
059	JAM	005	002	Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are become moth-eaten;
059	JAM	005	003	your gold and silver is rusted, and the rust of them will be a witness against you, and will eat your flesh as fire; ye have heaped up treasure in the last days!
059	JAM	005	004	Behold, the hire of the laborers who reaped your fields, which is fraudulently kept back by you, crieth out; and the cries of those who reaped have entered into the ears of the Lord of Hosts.
059	JAM	005	005	Ye have lived in luxury on the earth, and have been given to pleasure; ye have pampered your hearts in a day of slaughter.
059	JAM	005	006	Ye have condemned, ye have killed the just man; he doth not resist you.
059	JAM	005	007	Be patient therefore, brethren, until the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and is patient about it, until it hath received the early and latter rain.
059	JAM	005	008	Be ye also patient, establish your hearts, for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.
059	JAM	005	009	Murmur not against each other, brethren, that ye be not judged. Behold, the Judge standeth before the door.
059	JAM	005	010	Take, brethren, the prophets, who spoke in the name of the Lord, for an example of affliction, and of patience.
059	JAM	005	011	Behold, we count those happy who have endured. Ye have heard of the patience of Job; behold also the end of the Lord, that he is very pitiful, and of tender mercy.
059	JAM	005	012	But above all things, my brethren, swear not; neither by heaven, nor by the earth, nor by any other oath; but let your yea be yea, and your nay, nay; that ye fall not under condemnation.
059	JAM	005	013	Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any cheerful? let him sing praise.
059	JAM	005	014	Is any sick among you? let him call to him the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.
059	JAM	005	015	And the prayer of faith will save the sick, and the Lord will raise him up; even if he have committed sins, it shall be forgiven him.
059	JAM	005	016	Confess your trespasses to one another, and pray for one another, that ye may be healed. The earnest prayer of a righteous man availeth much.
059	JAM	005	017	Elijah was a man of like nature with us, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain; and it rained not on the earth for three years and six months;
059	JAM	005	018	and again he prayed, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit.
059	JAM	005	019	Brethren, if any one among you be led astray from the truth, and one convert him,
059	JAM	005	020	let him know that he who converteth a sinner from the error of his way will save a soul from death, and will cover a multitude of sins.

# BOOK	060	1PE	1 Peter	1 Peter
060	1PE	001	001	Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered through Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,
060	1PE	001	002	chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, in sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace and peace be multiplied to you.
060	1PE	001	003	Blessed be God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who, according to his abundant mercy, begot us again into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,
060	1PE	001	004	to an inheritance imperishable, and undefiled, and unfading, reserved in heaven for you,
060	1PE	001	005	who are guarded by the power of God through faith unto a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time;
060	1PE	001	006	wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a short time, if need be, made sorrowful by manifold trials,
060	1PE	001	007	that the proof of your faith, much more precious than gold which perisheth, but is tried with fire, may be found unto praise and glory and honor at the manifestation of Jesus Christ;
060	1PE	001	008	whom, having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory,
060	1PE	001	009	receiving the end of your faith, the salvation of your souls.
060	1PE	001	010	Concerning which salvation the prophets sought earnestly and searched earnestly, who prophesied of the grace that was to come to you;
060	1PE	001	011	searching what or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them signified, when it testified beforehand the sufferings to come upon Christ, and the glories that were to follow;
060	1PE	001	012	to whom it was revealed, that not to themselves, but to you, they were ministering the things, which have now been announced to you by them that have brought the glad tidings to you by the Holy Spirit sent down from heaven; which things angels desire to look into.
060	1PE	001	013	Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope undoubtingly for the grace that is to be brought to you at the manifestation of Jesus Christ;
060	1PE	001	014	as children of obedience, not conforming yourselves to the former lusts in your ignorance;
060	1PE	001	015	but as he who called you is holy, be ye also holy in all your conduct;
060	1PE	001	016	because it is written, “Ye shall be holy, for I am holy.”
060	1PE	001	017	And if ye call him Father who without respect of persons judgeth according to each one's work, pass the time of your sojourning here in fear;
060	1PE	001	018	knowing that not with perishable things, silver or gold, were ye redeemed from your vain manner of life received by tradition from your fathers,
060	1PE	001	019	but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot;
060	1PE	001	020	who was foreknown indeed before the foundation of the world, but manifested in these last times for you,
060	1PE	001	021	who through him have faith in God, who raised him from the dead and gave him glory, so that your faith and hope are in God.
060	1PE	001	022	Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth unto unfeigned brotherly love, love one another from the heart, fervently;
060	1PE	001	023	being born again, not of perishable seed, but of imperishable, through the word of God, which liveth and abideth.
060	1PE	001	024	Because, “All flesh is as grass, and all its glory as the flower of grass; the grass withered, and its flower fell off;
060	1PE	001	025	but the word of the Lord abideth for ever;” and this is the word which was preached to you.
060	1PE	002	001	Laying aside therefore all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all slander,
060	1PE	002	002	as new-born babes, desire the spiritual, pure milk, that ye may grow thereby to salvation;
060	1PE	002	003	if indeed ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious.
060	1PE	002	004	To whom coming, a living stone, rejected indeed by men, but in the sight of God chosen, honored,
060	1PE	002	005	be ye yourselves also, as living stones, built up, a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
060	1PE	002	006	Because it is contained in the Scripture: “Behold, I lay in Zion a chief corner-stone, chosen, honored; and he that believeth in him shall not be put to shame.”
060	1PE	002	007	To you therefore who believe, is the honor; but to the disobedient, “the stone which the builders rejected, the same hath become the corner-stone,”
060	1PE	002	008	and “a stone of stumbling, and a rock to strike against;” even to those who stumble, being disobedient to the word; to which they were also appointed.
060	1PE	002	009	But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for a possession, that ye may show forth the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light;
060	1PE	002	010	who once were not a people, but are now the people of God; who had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.
060	1PE	002	011	Beloved, I exhort you, as sojourners and strangers, to abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;
060	1PE	002	012	having your manner of life among the gentiles honorable; that, whereas they speak against you as evil-doers, they may by your good works, which they behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.
060	1PE	002	013	Submit yourselves therefore to every human institution for the Lord's sake; whether to the king, as supreme;
060	1PE	002	014	or to governors, as being sent by him for the punishment of evil-doers, and the praise of those who do well.
060	1PE	002	015	For so is the will of God, that with well-doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men;
060	1PE	002	016	as free, and not using your freedom for a cloak of wickedness, but as servants of God.
060	1PE	002	017	Honor all men; love the brotherhood; fear God; honor the king.
060	1PE	002	018	Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear, not only to the good and considerate, but also to the perverse.
060	1PE	002	019	For this is acceptable, if any one on account of a sense of duty to God endureth hardships, suffering wrongfully.
060	1PE	002	020	For what glory is it, if, when ye are beaten for your faults, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take it patiently [[it is glory]]; for this is acceptable with God.
060	1PE	002	021	For to this ye were called; because even Christ suffered for us, leaving you an example, that ye should follow his steps;
060	1PE	002	022	who committed no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth;
060	1PE	002	023	who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered did not threaten, but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously;
060	1PE	002	024	who himself bore our sins in his own body on the cross, that we, having died to our sins, should live to righteousness; by whose stripes ye were healed.
060	1PE	002	025	For ye were going astray like sheep; but ye have now returned to the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.
060	1PE	003	001	In like manner, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands, that even if any obey not the word, they may without the word be won by the behavior of the wives,
060	1PE	003	002	when they behold your chaste behavior coupled with fear.
060	1PE	003	003	Whose adorning, let it not be the out yard adorning of braiding the hair, and of wearing golden ornaments, or of putting on apparel;
060	1PE	003	004	but the hidden man of the heart, in that which is imperishable, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.
060	1PE	003	005	For in this manner in the old time the holy women also, who hoped in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection to their own husbands;
060	1PE	003	006	as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord; whose daughters ye have become, if ye do well, and fear no alarm.
060	1PE	003	007	Dwell likewise, O husband, with thy wife according to knowledge, as with the weaker vessel, giving her honor as being heir with thee of the grace of life, that your prayers be not hindered.
060	1PE	003	008	Finally, be, all of one mind, have fellow feeling, love as brethren, be compassionate, be humble;
060	1PE	003	009	not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing; but, on the contrary, blessing the evil-doer; because for this end ye were called, that ye might inherit blessing.
060	1PE	003	010	“For he that would love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips from speaking guile;
060	1PE	003	011	let him turn away from evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and pursue it.
060	1PE	003	012	For the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and his ears are toward their supplication; but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.”
060	1PE	003	013	And who is he that shall harm you, if ye are followers of that which is good?
060	1PE	003	014	But if ye even suffer for righteousness' sake, happy are ye. And be not afraid at their terrors, nor alarmed;
060	1PE	003	015	but sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts. And be ready always to give an answer to every one that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you, but with meekness and fear;
060	1PE	003	016	having a good conscience, that, wherein ye are evil spoken of, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conduct in Christ.
060	1PE	003	017	For it is better, if it be the will of God, that ye suffer for well-doing, than for evil-doing.
060	1PE	003	018	For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous one for the unrighteous, that he might bring you to God, being put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit;
060	1PE	003	019	in which also he went and preached to the spirits in prison,
060	1PE	003	020	who were disobedient in times past, when the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was preparing, wherein a few, that is, eight souls, were saved by water;
060	1PE	003	021	which in its antitype, baptism, is now saving you, —not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the earnest seeking for a good conscience toward God, —by the resurrection of Jesus Christ;
060	1PE	003	022	who is on the right hand of God, having gone into heaven, angels and authorities and powers being made subject to him.
060	1PE	004	001	Christ then having suffered in the flesh, do ye also arm yourselves with the same mind; for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin;
060	1PE	004	002	that ye may no longer live the remaining time in the flesh after the lusts of men, but after the will of God.
060	1PE	004	003	For sufficient is the time past to have wrought the will of the gentiles, when ye walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revelings, carousings, and abominable idolatries;
060	1PE	004	004	at which they are astonished that ye run not with them to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you;
060	1PE	004	005	who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the living and the dead.
060	1PE	004	006	For to this end was the gospel preached also to the dead, that they might indeed be judged according to men in the flesh, but might live according to God in the spirit.
060	1PE	004	007	But the end of all things is at hand; be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer.
060	1PE	004	008	And above all things have fervent love among yourselves; for love covereth a multitude of sins.
060	1PE	004	009	Be hospitable to one another without grudging.
060	1PE	004	010	According as each one hath received a gift, minister the same to one another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.
060	1PE	004	011	If any one speak, let him speak as uttering the oracles of God; if any minister, let him do it as from the ability which God giveth; that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory and the dominion for ever and ever. Amen.
060	1PE	004	012	Beloved, be not surprised at the fiery trial which is taking place among you to prove you, as though a strange thing were befalling you;
060	1PE	004	013	but, in so far as ye share in Christ's sufferings, rejoice; that also at the manifestation of his glory ye may rejoice with exceeding joy.
060	1PE	004	014	If ye are reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye for the Spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you.
060	1PE	004	015	For let none of you suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or an evil-doer, or as a busybody in other men's matters;
060	1PE	004	016	but if as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in this name.
060	1PE	004	017	For the time is come for judgment to begin at the house of God; but if it first begin with us, what will be the end of those who obey not the gospel of God?
060	1PE	004	018	and “if the righteous scarcely is saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?”
060	1PE	004	019	Wherefore let those who suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well-doing, as to a faithful Creator.
060	1PE	005	001	The elders among you I exhort, who am a fellow-elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, who am also a sharer in the glory that is to be revealed;
060	1PE	005	002	tend the flock of God which is among you, overseeing it, not by constraint, but willingly; not for base gain, but with ready mind;
060	1PE	005	003	not as lording it over your allotted charge, but being examples to the flock;
060	1PE	005	004	and when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye will receive the crown of glory that fadeth not away.
060	1PE	005	005	In like manner, ye younger men, submit yourselves to the elder; and all of you be clothed with humility toward each other; for “God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble.”
060	1PE	005	006	Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time;
060	1PE	005	007	casting all your care upon him, because he careth for you.
060	1PE	005	008	Be sober, be watchful. Your adversary the Devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour;
060	1PE	005	009	whom resist, steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same sufferings are being accomplished in your brethren in the world.
060	1PE	005	010	But the God of all grace, who called you to his everlasting glory in Christ Jesus, will, after ye have suffered a while, himself make you perfect, establish, strengthen, settle you.
060	1PE	005	011	To him be the dominion for ever. Amen.
060	1PE	005	012	By Silvanus, the faithful brother as I think, I have written to you in few words, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand.
060	1PE	005	013	The church in Babylon, chosen with you, saluteth you; and Mark, my son.
060	1PE	005	014	Salute one another with a kiss of love. Peace to you all that are in Christ.

# BOOK	061	2PE	2 Peter	2 Peter
061	2PE	001	001	Symeon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of our God, and the Saviour Jesus Christ:
061	2PE	001	002	Grace and peace be multiplied to you in the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord.
061	2PE	001	003	Seeing that his Divine power hath given to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and goodness;
061	2PE	001	004	through which he hath given us exceedingly great and precious promises, that by these ye may become partakers of the Divine nature, having escaped from the corruption that is in the world through lust;
061	2PE	001	005	even for this very reason, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue, and to virtue knowledge,
061	2PE	001	006	and to knowledge self-control, and to self-control endurance, and to endurance godliness,
061	2PE	001	007	and to godliness brotherly kindness, and to brotherly kindness love.
061	2PE	001	008	For if these things are in you and abound, they make you neither inactive nor unfruitful in gaining the full knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
061	2PE	001	009	But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was cleansed from his old sins.
061	2PE	001	010	Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure; for if ye do these things, ye will never fall.
061	2PE	001	011	For in this way the entrance will be richly furnished you into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
061	2PE	001	012	Wherefore I shall be careful always to remind you of these things, though ye know them, and are established in the truth that is with you.
061	2PE	001	013	Yea, I think it right, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by reminding you;
061	2PE	001	014	knowing that I must soon put off my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ declared to me.
061	2PE	001	015	Moreover I shall endeavor that at all times ye may be able, after my departure, to call these things to mind.
061	2PE	001	016	For we did not follow cunningly devised fables, when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but had been made eye-witnesses of his majesty.
061	2PE	001	017	For he received from God the Father honor and glory, when such a voice as this was borne to him from the excellent glory: “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.”
061	2PE	001	018	And this voice we heard borne from heaven when we were with him in the holy mount.
061	2PE	001	019	And we have more sure the prophetic word, to which ye do well in taking heed, as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day-star arise in your hearts;
061	2PE	001	020	knowing this first, that no prophecy of the Scripture cometh from private interpretation.
061	2PE	001	021	For prophecy never came by the will of man; but moved by the Holy Spirit, men spoke from God.
061	2PE	002	001	But there arose false prophets also among the people, as there will be false teachers among you also, who will stealthily bring in destructive factions, even denying the Lord that bought them; bringing upon themselves swift destruction.
061	2PE	002	002	And many will follow their dissolute ways, by reason of whom the way of truth will be evil spoken of;
061	2PE	002	003	and in covetousness will they with feigned words make merchandise of you; for whom the judgment long ago ordained lingereth not, and their destruction slumbereth not.
061	2PE	002	004	For if God spared not angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them over to chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment;
061	2PE	002	005	and spared not the old world, but saved Noah with seven others, a preacher of righteousness, when he brought in the flood upon the world of the ungodly;
061	2PE	002	006	and turning into ashes the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, condemned them to overthrow, making them an example for those who in after time should live ungodly;
061	2PE	002	007	and delivered righteous Lot, distressed by the lewd conduct of the lawless men;
061	2PE	002	008	(for that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing tormented his righteous soul from day to day with their lawless deeds; )
061	2PE	002	009	the Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptation, and to reserve the unrighteous under punishment to the day of judgment;
061	2PE	002	010	but chiefly those who walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise dominion. Presumptuous, self-willed, they are not afraid to rail at dignities;
061	2PE	002	011	whereas angels, who are greater in strength and power, bring not against them a railing accusation;
061	2PE	002	012	but these, as brute beasts, by nature born to be taken and destroyed, railing at things which they understand not, shall even perish in their own corruption,
061	2PE	002	013	receiving the wages of unrighteousness. Counting it pleasure to riot in the day-time, spots and blemishes, reveling in their deceits while they feast with you,
061	2PE	002	014	having eyes full of an adulteress, and that cannot cease from sin, alluring unstable souls, having a heart exercised in covetousness, children of a curse,
061	2PE	002	015	they have forsaken the right way, and have gone astray, following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness,
061	2PE	002	016	but was rebuked for his iniquity; the dumb ass, speaking with man's voice, restrained the madness of the prophet.
061	2PE	002	017	These are wells without water, and mists driven by a tempest; for whom the blackness of darkness is reserved.
061	2PE	002	018	For speaking great swelling words of vanity, they allure in the lusts of the flesh, by dissolute ways, such as were in some measure escaping from those who live in error;
061	2PE	002	019	promising them liberty, while they themselves are slaves of corruption; for by what a man is overcome, by the same is he also brought into bondage.
061	2PE	002	020	For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein and overcome, the last state is worse with them than the first.
061	2PE	002	021	For it would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after having known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered to them.
061	2PE	002	022	It hath happened to them according to the true proverb, The dog returned to his own vomit; and, The sow that was washed, to her wallowing in the mire.
061	2PE	003	001	This second letter, beloved, I now write to you, in both which I stir up your pure minds by putting you in remembrance;
061	2PE	003	002	that ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of the Lord and Saviour by your apostles;
061	2PE	003	003	knowing this first, that there will come in the last days open scoffers following their own lusts,
061	2PE	003	004	and saying, Where is his promised coming? for, from the time when the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as then, and as they have continued from the beginning of the creation.
061	2PE	003	005	For of this they are willingly ignorant, that of old by the word of God there were heavens, and an earth formed out of the water and by the water,
061	2PE	003	006	by means of which the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished;
061	2PE	003	007	but the present heavens and the present earth are by his word kept in store, reserved for fire against the day of judgment and the perdition of ungodly men.
061	2PE	003	008	But forget not, beloved, this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.
061	2PE	003	009	The Lord is not tardy concerning his promise, as some men count tardiness; but is long-suffering toward you, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.
061	2PE	003	010	But the day of the Lord will come as a thief; in which the heavens will pass away with a great noise, and the elements will melt with fervent heat, and the earth and the works that are therein will be burned up.
061	2PE	003	011	Seeing that all these things are thus to be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in holy conduct and godliness,
061	2PE	003	012	looking for and hastening the coming of the day of God, by reason of which the heavens being on fire will be dissolved, and the elements will melt with fervent heat!
061	2PE	003	013	But, according to his promise, we look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.
061	2PE	003	014	Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for these things, be diligent that ye may be found without spot and blameless before him in peace,
061	2PE	003	015	and account the long-suffering of our Lord salvation; as also our beloved brother Paul, according to the wisdom given to him, wrote to you,
061	2PE	003	016	as also in all his letters, speaking in them of these things; in which things are some that are hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as also the other Scriptures, to their own destruction.
061	2PE	003	017	Do ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things beforehand, beware lest, being led away with the error of the lawless, ye fall from your own steadfastness.
061	2PE	003	018	But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be the glory, both now and for ever.

# BOOK	062	1JO	1 John	1 John
062	1JO	001	001	That which was from the beginning, that which we have heard, that which we have seen with our eyes, that which we looked upon, and our hands handled, concerning the word of life,
062	1JO	001	002	—and the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and announce to you the everlasting life, which was with the Father, and was manifested to us, —
062	1JO	001	003	that which we have seen and heard we announce to you, that ye also may have fellowship with us; and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.
062	1JO	001	004	And these things we write to you, that your joy may be full.
062	1JO	001	005	And this is the message which we have heard from him, and announce to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.
062	1JO	001	006	If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in the darkness, we lie, and do not the truth;
062	1JO	001	007	but if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanseth us from all sin.
062	1JO	001	008	If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.
062	1JO	001	009	If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
062	1JO	001	010	If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.
062	1JO	002	001	My children, these things I write to you, that ye may not sin. And if any one have sinned, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.
062	1JO	002	002	And he is a propitiation for our sins; and not for ours only, but also for the whole world.
062	1JO	002	003	And hereby we know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.
062	1JO	002	004	He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.
062	1JO	002	005	But whoever keepeth his word, truly in him is the love of God perfected. Hereby we know that we are in him.
062	1JO	002	006	He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.
062	1JO	002	007	Beloved, I write no new commandment to you, but an old commandment, which ye have had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which ye have heard.
062	1JO	002	008	Again, a new commandment I write to you, which thing is true in him, and in you; because the darkness is passing away, and the true light now shineth.
062	1JO	002	009	He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in the darkness until now.
062	1JO	002	010	He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is no occasion of stumbling in him;
062	1JO	002	011	but he that hateth his brother is in the darkness, and walketh in the darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because the darkness hath blinded his eyes.
062	1JO	002	012	I write to you, my children, because your sins have been forgiven you for his name's sake.
062	1JO	002	013	I write to you, fathers, because ye know him that was from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because ye have overcome the Evil One. I have written to you, my children, because ye know the Father.
062	1JO	002	014	I have written to you, fathers, because ye know him that was from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the Evil One.
062	1JO	002	015	Love not the world, nor the things in the world. If any one loveth the world, the love of the Father is not in him;
062	1JO	002	016	because all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.
062	1JO	002	017	And the world is passing away, and the lust thereof; but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.
062	1JO	002	018	My children, the last time is come; and as ye have heard that Antichrist is coming, even now there are many antichrists; whereby we know that the last time is come.
062	1JO	002	019	They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have remained with us; but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they are not all of us.
062	1JO	002	020	And ye have an anointing from the Holy One, and know all things.
062	1JO	002	021	I have not written to you because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth.
062	1JO	002	022	Who is the liar, but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist, who denieth the Father and the Son.
062	1JO	002	023	Whoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father; he that acknowledgeth the Son hath also the Father.
062	1JO	002	024	As for you, let that which ye have heard from the beginning abide in you. If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall abide in you, ye also will abide in the Son, and in the Father.
062	1JO	002	025	And this is the promise which he himself promised us, even the life everlasting.
062	1JO	002	026	These things I have written to you concerning those who seduce you.
062	1JO	002	027	And the anointing which ye yourselves received from him abideth in you, and ye have no need that any one teach you; but as his anointing teacheth you concerning all things, and is truth, and is not a lie, even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him.
062	1JO	002	028	And now, my children, abide in him; that when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.
062	1JO	002	029	If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one also that doeth righteousness hath been born of him.
062	1JO	003	001	Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called children of God l For this cause the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not.
062	1JO	003	002	Beloved, now are we children of God, and it hath not yet been manifested what we shall be. We know that, when it shall be manifested, we shall be like him; because we shall see him as he is.
062	1JO	003	003	And every one that hath this hope in Him purifieth himself, even as He is pure.
062	1JO	003	004	Whoever committeth sin transgresseth thereby the law; for sin is a transgression of the law.
062	1JO	003	005	And ye know that he was manifested to take away sins; and in him is no sin.
062	1JO	003	006	Whoever abideth in him sinneth not; whoever sinneth hath not seen him, nor known him.
062	1JO	003	007	My children, let no one deceive you; he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.
062	1JO	003	008	He that committeth sin is of the Devil; for the Devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the Devil.
062	1JO	003	009	Whoever hath been born of God doth not commit sin, because his seed abideth in him; and he cannot sin, because he hath been born of God.
062	1JO	003	010	In this are manifest the children of God and the children of the Devil. Whoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, and he that loveth not his brother.
062	1JO	003	011	For this is the message that ye have heard from the beginning, that we should love one another;
062	1JO	003	012	not as Cain was of the Evil One, and slew his brother. And wherefore did he slay him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous.
062	1JO	003	013	Wonder not, brethren, if the world hateth you.
062	1JO	003	014	We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brethren; he that loveth not abideth in death.
062	1JO	003	015	Whoever hateth his brother is a murderer; and ye know that no murderer hath everlasting life abiding in him.
062	1JO	003	016	Herein we know love, in that he laid down his life for us; and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.
062	1JO	003	017	But whoever hath this world's goods, and seeth his brother having need, and shutteth up his compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?
062	1JO	003	018	My children, let us not love in word, nor in tongue, but in deed and in truth.
062	1JO	003	019	And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him;
062	1JO	003	020	because if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.
062	1JO	003	021	Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, we have confidence toward God;
062	1JO	003	022	and whatever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do the things that are pleasing in his sight.
062	1JO	003	023	And this is his commandment, that we should believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and should love one another, as he gave commandment.
062	1JO	003	024	And he that keepeth his commandments abideth in him, and he in him; and hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit, which he gave us.
062	1JO	004	001	Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits, whether they are of God; because many false prophets have gone forth into the world.
062	1JO	004	002	Hereby ye know the Spirit of God: Every spirit that acknowledgeth that Jesus Christ hath come in the flesh, is of God.
062	1JO	004	003	And every spirit that doth not acknowledge Jesus, is not of God; and this is that spirit of Antichrist, of which ye have heard that it is to come, and even now it is already in the world.
062	1JO	004	004	Ye are of God, my children, and have overcome them; because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.
062	1JO	004	005	They are of the world; therefore they speak of the world, and the world heareth them.
062	1JO	004	006	We are of God; he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth us not. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.
062	1JO	004	007	Beloved, let us love one another; for love is from God, and every one that loveth hath been born of God, and knoweth God;
062	1JO	004	008	he that loveth not hath not known God; for God is love.
062	1JO	004	009	In this was manifested the love of God in regard to us, that God hath sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we may live through him.
062	1JO	004	010	Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be a propitiation for our sins.
062	1JO	004	011	Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.
062	1JO	004	012	No one hath ever seen God. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.
062	1JO	004	013	Hereby we know that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit.
062	1JO	004	014	And we have seen and bear witness, that the Father hath sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world.
062	1JO	004	015	Whoever acknowledgeth that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God.
062	1JO	004	016	And we have known and believed the love that God hath in regard to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.
062	1JO	004	017	Herein hath love been perfected with us, that we have confidence in the day of judgment; because as he is, so are we in this world.
062	1JO	004	018	There is no fear in love, but perfect love casteth out fear; because fear hath torment; and he that feareth is not made perfect in love.
062	1JO	004	019	We love, because he first loved us.
062	1JO	004	020	If any one saith, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar; for he that loveth not his brother, whom he hath seen, how can he love God, whom he hath not seen?
062	1JO	004	021	And this commandment we have from him, that he who loveth God love also his brother.
062	1JO	005	001	Whoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ hath been born of God; and every one that loveth him that begat, loveth also him that hath been begotten of him.
062	1JO	005	002	By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and do his commandments.
062	1JO	005	003	For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments; and his commandments are not burdensome,
062	1JO	005	004	because whatever is born of God overcometh the world; and this is the victory that hath overcome the world, even our faith.
062	1JO	005	005	Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?
062	1JO	005	006	This is he who came by water and blood, Jesus Christ; not in the water only, but in the water and in the blood; and the Spirit is that which beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth.
062	1JO	005	008	For there are three that bear witness, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood; and these three agree in one.
062	1JO	005	009	If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater; for this is the witness of God, that he hath borne witness concerning his Son.
062	1JO	005	010	He that believeth in the Son of God hath the witness within him; he that believeth not God hath made him a liar, because he hath not believed in the witness which God hath borne concerning his Son.
062	1JO	005	011	And this is the witness, that God gave to us everlasting life, and this life is in his Son.
062	1JO	005	012	He that hath the Son hath the life; he that hath not the Son of God hath not the life.
062	1JO	005	013	These things have I written to you, that ye may know that ye who believe in the name of the Son of God have everlasting life.
062	1JO	005	014	And this is the confidence which we have toward him, that, if we ask anything according to his will, he heareth us;
062	1JO	005	015	and if we know that he heareth us, whatever we ask, we know that we have the requests which we have asked of him.
062	1JO	005	016	If any one see his brother sin a sin not unto death, he shall ask, and shall give him life, —to those who sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death; for that I do not say that he shall pray.
062	1JO	005	017	All unrighteousness is sin; and there is a sin not unto death.
062	1JO	005	018	We know that whoever hath been born of God sinneth not; but he that is born of God keepeth himself, and the Evil One toucheth him not.
062	1JO	005	019	We know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth under the dominion of the Evil One.
062	1JO	005	020	And we know that the Son of God hath come, and hath given us understanding, that we may know the True One; and we are in the True One, in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and everlasting life.
062	1JO	005	021	My children, keep yourselves from idols.

063	2JO	001	001	The elder to the elect Cyria, and to her children, whom I love in truth, and not I only, but also all that know the truth, —
063	2JO	001	002	for the sake of the truth which abideth in us, and will be with us for ever.
063	2JO	001	003	Grace, mercy, peace shall be with you from God the Father, and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.
063	2JO	001	004	I rejoiced greatly, that I found some of thy children walking in truth, as we received commandment from the Father.
063	2JO	001	005	And now I beseech thee, Cyria, not as writing to thee a new commandment, but that which we have had from the beginning, that we love one another.
063	2JO	001	006	And this is love, that we walk according to his commandments. This is the commandment, as ye have heard from the beginning, that ye should walk in it.
063	2JO	001	007	For many deceivers went out into the world, who do not acknowledge Jesus Christ coming in the flesh; this is the deceiver and the antichrist.
063	2JO	001	008	Look to yourselves, that ye lose not the things which ye wrought, but receive a full reward.
063	2JO	001	009	Whoever goeth beyond, and abideth not in the teaching of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the teaching, he hath both the Son and the Father.
063	2JO	001	010	If any one cometh to you, and bringeth not this teaching, receive him not into your house, and do not bid him good speed.
063	2JO	001	011	For he that biddeth him good speed taketh part in his evil deeds.
063	2JO	001	012	Having many things to write to you, I would not write with paper and ink; but I hope to come to you, and to speak face to face, that our joy may be full.

064	3JO	001	005	Beloved, thou doest a faithful thing whatever thou doest to the brethren, and that to strangers,
064	3JO	001	006	who bore witness of thy love before the church; whom if thou send forward on their journey in a manner worthy of God, thou wilt do well.
064	3JO	001	007	For in behalf of the Name they went forth, taking nothing of the gentiles.
064	3JO	001	008	We therefore ought to sustain such persons, that we may be fellow-workers for the truth.
064	3JO	001	009	I wrote something to the church; but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the pre-eminence among them, receiveth us not.
064	3JO	001	010	Wherefore, if I come, I will bring to remembrance his deeds which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words; and not content therewith, he himself doth not receive the brethren, and those that would he forbiddeth, and casteth them out of the church.
064	3JO	001	011	Beloved, do not imitate that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God; he that doeth evil hath not seen God.
064	3JO	001	012	To Demetrius testimony hath been borne by all, and by the truth itself; yea, we also bear witness, and ye know that our witness is true.
064	3JO	001	013	I had many things to write to thee, but I do not wish to write to thee with ink and pen;
064	3JO	001	014	but I hope to see thee immediately, and we shall speak face to face. Peace be to thee. The friends salute thee. Salute the friends by name.

065	JUD	001	001	Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to the called, loved in God the Father and kept by Jesus Christ:
065	JUD	001	002	Mercy and peace and love be multiplied to you.
065	JUD	001	003	Beloved, while giving all diligence to write to you, I found it necessary to write to you concerning the common salvation, exhorting you to contend earnestly for the faith which was once delivered to the saints.
065	JUD	001	004	For there have stealthily crept in certain men who were of old appointed beforehand for this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into wantonness, and denying the only Sovereign, and our Lord Jesus Christ.
065	JUD	001	005	But I wish to remind you as once knowing it all, that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed those who believed not;
065	JUD	001	006	and the angels which kept not their principality, but left their own dwelling-place, he hath kept in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day;
065	JUD	001	007	even as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities about them, in like manner with them giving themselves over to fornication, and going away after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of everlasting fire.
065	JUD	001	008	Yet in like manner these dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion, and rail at dignities.
065	JUD	001	009	Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the Devil he disputed about the body of Moses, dared not bring against him a railing accusation, but said: The Lord rebuke thee.
065	JUD	001	010	But these rail at the things which they know not; but what things they understand naturally, as brute beasts, in these they corrupt themselves.
065	JUD	001	011	Woe to them! for they have gone in the way of Cain, and rushed on in the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the gainsaying of Korah.
065	JUD	001	012	These are the rocks in your feasts of love, feasting together without fear, feeding only themselves; clouds without water, carried away by winds; trees in late autumn, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;
065	JUD	001	013	raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, for whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever.
065	JUD	001	014	Yea, and against these Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied, saying, “Behold, the Lord cometh in the midst of his holy myriads,
065	JUD	001	015	to execute judgment upon all, and to convict all the ungodly among them of all the deeds of their ungodliness which they committed; and of all the hard things which ungodly sinners spoke against him.”
065	JUD	001	016	These are murmurers, complaining of their lot, walking according to their own lusts; and their mouth speaketh great swelling words; admiring men's persons, for the sake of profit.
065	JUD	001	017	But do ye, beloved, remember the words which were before spoken by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;
065	JUD	001	018	that they told you that at the last time there would be scoffers, walking according to their own ungodly lusts.
065	JUD	001	019	These are they that separate themselves, sensual, not having the Spirit.
065	JUD	001	020	But do ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit,
065	JUD	001	021	keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.
065	JUD	001	022	And some rebuke when they contend; and others save, snatching them out of the fire; and on others have compassion
065	JUD	001	023	with fear, hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.
065	JUD	001	024	But to him that is able to keep them from falling, and to present them faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy,
065	JUD	001	025	to the only God our Saviour, through Jesus Christ our Lord, is glory, majesty, dominion and power, before all time, and now, and for ever. Amen.

066	REV	001	001	The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him, to show to his servants what must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified it by his angel to his servant John;
066	REV	001	002	who bore witness of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, —of whatever he saw.
066	REV	001	003	Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of the prophecy, and keep the things written therein; for the time is at hand.
066	REV	001	004	John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace be to you, and peace, from him who is, and who was, and who is to come; and from the seven spirits which are before his throne;
066	REV	001	005	and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the first-born of the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To him that loveth us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood,
066	REV	001	006	and made us a kingdom, priests to God his Father, to him be the glory and the dominion for ever. Amen.
066	REV	001	007	Behold, he cometh with the clouds, and every eye shall see him, and they who pierced him; and all the tribes of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen.
066	REV	001	008	I am the Alpha and the Omega, saith the Lord God, he who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty.
066	REV	001	009	I John, your brother, and companion in the affliction and kingdom and endurance in Jesus, was in the isle that is called Patmos, on account of the word of God, and the testimony of Jesus.
066	REV	001	010	I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day; and I heard behind me a loud voice, as of a trumpet,
066	REV	001	011	saying: What thou seest, write in a book, and send it to the seven churches; to Ephesus, and to Smyrna, and to Pergamus, and to Thyatira, and to Sardes, and to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.
066	REV	001	012	And I turned to see the voice that was speaking with me; and having turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks,
066	REV	001	013	and in the midst of the candlesticks one like to a son of man, clothed with a garment reaching down to the feet, and girded at the breasts with a golden girdle.
066	REV	001	014	His head and his hairs were white as white wool, as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire;
066	REV	001	015	and his feet were like fine brass, as if burning in a furnace; and his voice was as the sound of many waters.
066	REV	001	016	And he had in his right hand seven stars; and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword; and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength.
066	REV	001	017	And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead; and he laid his right hand on me, saying, Fear not; I am the first and the last,
066	REV	001	018	and he that liveth; and I was dead, and behold, I am alive for evermore; and I have the keys of death and the underworld.
066	REV	001	019	Write therefore the things which thou sawest, and the things which are, and the things which shall be after these;
066	REV	001	020	the mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches; and the seven candlesticks are the seven churches.
066	REV	002	001	To the angel of the church in Ephesus write: These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks:
066	REV	002	002	I know thy works, and thy labor, and thy endurance, and that thou canst not bear evil men; and thou didst try those who say they are apostles, and are not, and didst find them liars;
066	REV	002	003	and thou hast endurance, and hast borne on account of my name, and hast not become weary.
066	REV	002	004	But I have this against thee, that thou hast left thy first love.
066	REV	002	005	Remember therefore whence thou hast fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come to thee, and will remove thy candlestick out of its place, unless thou repent.
066	REV	002	006	But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.
066	REV	002	007	He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches. To him that overcometh I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of my God.
066	REV	002	008	And to the angel of the church in Smyrna write: These things saith the first and the last, who was dead, and lived again:
066	REV	002	009	I know thy affliction and poverty, (but thou art rich, ) and the blasphemy of those who say they are Jews, and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.
066	REV	002	010	Fear not the things which thou art about to suffer. Behold, now, the Devil is about to cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye will have tribulation ten days. Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee the crown of life.
066	REV	002	011	He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches. He that overcometh shall not be hurt by the second death.
066	REV	002	012	And to the angel of the church in Pergamus write: These things saith he that hath the sharp two-edged sword:
066	REV	002	013	I know where thou dwellest, where the throne of Satan is; and thou holdest fast my name, and didst not deny my faith, even in the days in which Antipas was my witness, my faithful one, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth.
066	REV	002	014	But I have a few things against thee; thou hast there them that hold the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to put a stumbling-block in the way of the sons of Israel, and to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit fornication.
066	REV	002	015	So thou also hast men holding the teaching of the Nicolaitans, in like manner.
066	REV	002	016	Repent therefore; or else I will come to thee quickly, and will make war with them with the sword of my mouth.
066	REV	002	017	He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches. To him that overcometh, I will give of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name written, which no one knoweth but he that receiveth it.
066	REV	002	018	And to the angel of the church in Thyatira write: These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like a flame of fire, and his feet are like fine brass:
066	REV	002	019	I know thy works, and love, and faith, and service, and thy endurance, and that thy last works are more than the first.
066	REV	002	020	But I have this against thee, that thou sufferest thy wife Jezebel, who calleth herself a prophetess, and she teacheth and seduceth my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed to idols.
066	REV	002	021	And I gave her time to repent, and she will not repent of her fornication.
066	REV	002	022	Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and those who together with her commit adultery into great distress, unless they repent of her deeds.
066	REV	002	023	And her children I will slay with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he who searcheth the reins and hearts; and I will give to every one of you according to your works.
066	REV	002	024	But to you I say, the rest who are in Thyatira, as many as have not this teaching, such as have not known “the depths” of Satan, as they speak; I put upon you no other burden;
066	REV	002	025	but that which ye have, hold fast till I come.
066	REV	002	026	And he that overcometh, and he that keepeth my works to the end, to him I will give authority over the nations, —
066	REV	002	027	and he shall rule them with a rod of iron, as the vessels of a potter are broken to shivers, —as I also have received of my Father.
066	REV	002	028	And I will give him the morning star.
066	REV	002	029	He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches.
066	REV	003	001	And to the angel of the church in Sardes write: These things saith he who hath the seven spirits of God, and the seven stars: I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead.
066	REV	003	002	Be watchful, and strengthen the remaining things, that were ready to die; for I have not found thy works perfect before my God.
066	REV	003	003	Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and keep those things, and repent. If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come as a thief, and thou shalt not know at what hour I will come upon thee.
066	REV	003	004	But thou hast a few names in Sardes which have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white, for they are worthy.
066	REV	003	005	He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white garments; and I will not blot out his name from the book of life, and I will acknowledge his name before my Father, and before his angels.
066	REV	003	006	He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches.
066	REV	003	007	And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write: These things saith he who is holy, he who is true, he who hath the key of David; he who openeth, and no one shall shut; and shutteth, and no one shall open:
066	REV	003	008	I know thy works; behold, I have set before thee an open door, which no one can shut; for thou hast little power, and yet hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name.
066	REV	003	009	Behold, I will make those of the synagogue of Satan, who say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie, —behold, I will make them to come and bow down before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee.
066	REV	003	010	Because thou hast kept my injunction of endurance, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which is about to come upon the whole world, to try those who dwell upon the earth.
066	REV	003	011	I come quickly; hold fast that which thou hast, that no one may take thy crown.
066	REV	003	012	He that overcometh, I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall nevermore go out; and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my Gods and I will write upon him my new name.
066	REV	003	013	He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches.
066	REV	003	014	And to the angel of the church in Laodicea write: These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God:
066	REV	003	015	I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot; I would thou wert cold or hot.
066	REV	003	016	So then, because thou art lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I am about to vomit thee out of my mouth.
066	REV	003	017	Because thou sayest, I am rich, and have gotten wealth, and have need of nothing, and knowest not that thou art the wretched and the pitiable one, and poor, and blind, and naked,
066	REV	003	018	I advise thee to buy of me gold refined by fire, that thou mayst be rich; and white garments, that thou mayst be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness may not be made manifest; and eye-salve to anoint thine eyes, that thou mayst see.
066	REV	003	019	As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten. Be zealous therefore, and repent.
066	REV	003	020	Behold, I stand at the door, and knock; if any one hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.
066	REV	003	021	He that overcometh, I will give to him to sit with me on my throne, even as I also overcame, and sat down with my Father on his throne.
066	REV	003	022	He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches,
066	REV	004	001	After this I saw, and lo! an open door in heaven; and the former voice, which I heard as of a trumpet speaking with me, said, Come up hither, and I will show thee what things must take place after these.
066	REV	004	002	Immediately I was in the Spirit; and lo! a throne was set ha heaven, and one sat on the throne.
066	REV	004	003	And he who sat was in appearance like a jasper stone and a sardius; and there was a rainbow around the throne like in appearance to an emerald.
066	REV	004	004	And around the throne were twenty-four thrones; and upon the thrones I saw the twenty-four elders sitting, clothed in white garments, and on their heads crowns of gold.
066	REV	004	005	And out of the throne proceed lightnings, and voices and thunders; and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven spirits of God;
066	REV	004	006	and before the throne there was as it were a sea of glass like to crystal; and in the middle before the throne, and around the throne, were four living creatures full of eyes before and behind.
066	REV	004	007	And the first living creature was like a lion, and the second living creature like a calf, and the third living creature had the face of a man, and the fourth living creature was like a flying eagle.
066	REV	004	008	And the four living creatures, having each of them six wings, around and within are full of eyes; and they have no rest day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, who was, and who is, and who is to come.
066	REV	004	009	And when the living creatures give glory, and honor, and thanksgiving to him that sitteth on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever,
066	REV	004	010	the twenty-four elders fall down before him that sitteth on the throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying,
066	REV	004	011	Worthy art thou, O Lord, and our God, to receive the glory, and the honor, and the power; for thou didst create all things, and on account of thy will they were, and were created.
066	REV	005	001	And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and without, sealed fast with seven seals.
066	REV	005	002	And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose its seals?
066	REV	005	003	And no one in heaven, nor on the earth, nor under the earth, was able to open the book, nor to look thereon.
066	REV	005	004	And I wept much, because no one was found worthy to open the book, nor to look thereon.
066	REV	005	005	And one of the elders saith to me, Weep not; behold, the Lion that is of the tribe of Judah, the shoot from David, conquered, he that openeth the book, and its seven seals.
066	REV	005	006	And I saw, between the throne and the four living creatures and the elders, a Lamb standing, as if it had been slain, having seven horns, and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.
066	REV	005	007	And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne.
066	REV	005	008	And when he had taken the book, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, having each one a harp, and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.
066	REV	005	009	And they sing a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open its seals; for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed to God by thy blood men out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation,
066	REV	005	010	and hast made them a kingdom and priests, and they reign on the earth.
066	REV	005	011	And I saw, and I heard the voice of many angels around the throne and the living creatures and the elders; and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands;
066	REV	005	012	saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive the power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honor, and glory, and blessing.
066	REV	005	013	And every creature which is in heaven, and those which are on the earth and under the earth, and on the sea, and the things in them, I heard them all saying, To him that sitteth upon the throne, and to the Lamb, be the blessing, and the honor, and the glory, and the dominion, for ever and ever.
066	REV	005	014	And the four living creatures said Amen. And the elders fell down and worshipped.
066	REV	006	001	And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seven seals, and I heard, as it were the voice of thunder, one of the four living creatures saying, Come!
066	REV	006	002	And I saw, and lo! a white horse, and he that sat on him, having a bow; and a crown was given to him, and he went forth conquering, and to conquer.
066	REV	006	003	And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, Come!
066	REV	006	004	And there went forth another horse, that was red; and to him that sat thereon it was given to take peace from the earth, and that men should slay one another; and there was given to him a great sword.
066	REV	006	005	And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature saying, Come! And I saw, and lo! a black horse, and he that sat on him, having a pair of scales in his hand.
066	REV	006	006	And I heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures, saying, A quart of wheat for a denary, and three quarts of barley for a denary; and, Hurt not the oil and the wine.
066	REV	006	007	And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the fourth living creature saying, Come!
066	REV	006	008	And I saw, and lo! a pale horse, and the name of him that sat on him was Death; and the underworld was following with him; and there was given to them power over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with famine, and with death, and by the wild beasts of the earth.
066	REV	006	009	And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain on account of the word of God, and on account of the testimony which they had borne;
066	REV	006	010	and they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, the holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?
066	REV	006	011	And a white robe was given to them, and it was said to them that they should rest yet for a time, until their fellow-servants also and their brethren, that were about to be killed as they were, should finish their course.
066	REV	006	012	And I saw when he had opened the sixth seal, and there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the whole moon became as blood,
066	REV	006	013	and the stars of heaven fell to the earth, as a fig-tree casteth its untimely figs when shaken by a great wind;
066	REV	006	014	and the heaven passed off, as a scroll when it is rolled up, and every mountain and island were moved out of their places;
066	REV	006	015	and the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the chief captains, and the rich men, and the strong men, and every bondman and freeman hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains;
066	REV	006	016	and they say to the mountains and the rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb;
066	REV	006	017	for the great day of his wrath is come, and who is able to stand?
066	REV	007	001	And after this, I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that no wind should blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree.
066	REV	007	002	And I saw another angel coming up from the rising of the sun, having the seal of the living God; and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea,
066	REV	007	003	saying, Hurt not the earth, nor the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads.
066	REV	007	004	And I heard the number of the sealed. A hundred and forty-four thousand were sealed out of all the tribes of the sons of Israel.
066	REV	007	005	Out of the tribe of Judah were sealed twelve thousand; out of the tribe of Reuben, twelve thousand; out of the tribe of Gad, twelve thousand;
066	REV	007	006	out of the tribe of Asher, twelve thousand; out of the tribe of Naphtali, twelve thousand; out of the tribe of Manasseh, twelve thousand;
066	REV	007	007	out of the tribe of Simeon, twelve thousand; out of the tribe of Levi, twelve thousand; out of the tribe of Issachar, twelve thousand;
066	REV	007	008	out of the tribe of Zebulun, twelve thousand; out of the tribe of Joseph, twelve thousand; out of the tribe of Benjamin twelve thousand were sealed.
066	REV	007	009	After these things I saw, and lo! a great multitude, which no one could number, out of every nation and all tribes and peoples and tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes, and palms in their hands.
066	REV	007	010	And they cry with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God who sitteth upon the throne, and to the Lamb.
066	REV	007	011	And all the angels were standing around the throne and the elders and the four living creatures, and they fell before the throne on their faces, and worshipped God,
066	REV	007	012	saying, Amen; the blessing, and the glory, and the wisdom, and the thanksgiving, and the honor, and the power, and the might, be to our God, for ever and ever.
066	REV	007	013	And one of the elders answered, saying to me, These who are clothed in the white robes, who are they, and whence came they?
066	REV	007	014	And I said to him, My lord, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are they who come out of the great tribulation, and they washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.
066	REV	007	015	Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple; and he that sitteth on the throne will make his abode with them.
066	REV	007	016	They shall hunger no more, nor thirst any more; neither shall the sun fall upon them, nor any burning heat;
066	REV	007	017	for the Lamb who is in the midst before the throne is a shepherd to them, and leadeth them to the fountains of the waters of life; and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.
066	REV	008	001	And when be had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about haft an hour.
066	REV	008	002	And I saw the seven angels who stand before God; and there were given to them seven trumpets.
066	REV	008	003	And another angel came, and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given to him much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne.
066	REV	008	004	And the smoke of the incense went up with the prayers of the saints before God out of the angel's hand.
066	REV	008	005	And the angel took the censer, and filled it from the fire of the altar, and cast it upon the earth; and there followed thunders, and lightnings, and voices, and an earthquake.
066	REV	008	006	And the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.
066	REV	008	007	And the first sounded, and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth; and the third part of the earth was burnt up, and the third part of the trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up.
066	REV	008	008	And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea;
066	REV	008	009	and the third part of the sea became blood; and the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and had life, died; and the third part of the ships were destroyed.
066	REV	008	010	And the third angel sounded, and there fell from heaven a great star, burning as a torch, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters.
066	REV	008	011	And the name of the star is called Wormwood; and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter.
066	REV	008	012	And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars, so that the third part of them was darkened, and the day shone not for a third part of it, and the night in like manner.
066	REV	008	013	And I saw, and heard an eagle flying in mid-heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to those who dwell on the earth, by reason of the remaining voices of the trumpet of the three angels who are yet to sound!
066	REV	009	001	And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fallen out of heaven to the earth, and to him was given the key of the pit of the abyss;
066	REV	009	002	and he opened the pit of the abyss. And there went up a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace, and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit.
066	REV	009	003	And out of the smoke went forth locusts upon the earth, and to them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power;
066	REV	009	004	and it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, nor any green thing, nor any tree, but only those men who have not the seal of God upon their foreheads;
066	REV	009	005	and it was given to them that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months; and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion, when it hath struck a man.
066	REV	009	006	And in those days men will seek death, and shall not find it; and will desire to die, and death will flee from them.
066	REV	009	007	And the shapes of the locusts were like horses prepared for battle; and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold, and their faces were as the faces of men;
066	REV	009	008	and they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as the teeth of lions.
066	REV	009	009	And they had breastplates like breastplates of iron, and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle.
066	REV	009	010	And they have tails like scorpions, and stings; and in their tails is their power to hurt men five months.
066	REV	009	011	They have over them a king, the angel of the abyss, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek he hath for his name Apollyon.
066	REV	009	012	The first woe is past; behold, two woes more are yet to come.
066	REV	009	013	And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice out of the four horns of the golden altar, which is before God,
066	REV	009	014	saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, Loose the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates.
066	REV	009	015	And the four angels were loosed, who were in readiness for the hour, and day, and month, and year, to slay the third part of men.
066	REV	009	016	And the number of the armies of the horsemen was two hundred thousand thousand; I heard the number of them.
066	REV	009	017	And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and those who sat on them, having breastplates of a fiery, and a dark blue, and a brimstone color; and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions, and out of their mouths issued fire, and smoke, and brimstone.
066	REV	009	018	By these three plagues was the third part of men killed, by the fire, and the smoke, and the brimstone, which issued out of their mouths.
066	REV	009	019	For the power of the horses is in their mouth, and in their tails; for their tails are like to serpents, having heads; and with them they do hurt.
066	REV	009	020	And the rest of men, who were not killed by these plagues, did not repent of the works of their hands, that they should not worship demons, and idols of gold, and of silver, and of brass, and of stone, and of wood, which can neither see; nor hear, nor walk;
066	REV	009	021	and they did not repent of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts.
066	REV	010	001	And I saw another strong angel coming down from heaven, clothed with a cloud, and a rainbow was upon his head, and his face was like the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire.
066	REV	010	002	And he had in his hand a little book open. And he set his right foot upon the sea, and the left upon the land;
066	REV	010	003	and he cried with a loud voice, as a lion roars. And when he had cried, the seven thunders uttered their voices.
066	REV	010	004	And when the seven thunders had spoken, I was about to write; and I heard a voice from heaven saying, Seal up the things which the seven thunders spoke, and write them not.
066	REV	010	005	And the angel whom I saw standing upon the sea, and upon the land, lifted up his right hand to heaven,
066	REV	010	006	and swore by him who liveth for ever and ever, who created the heaven, and the things therein, and the earth and the things therein, and the sea, and the things therein, that there should be no longer delay;
066	REV	010	007	but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he is about to sound, then should be finished the mystery of God, as he declared the glad tidings to his servants the prophets.
066	REV	010	008	And the voice which I heard out of heaven I heard again speaking to me, and saying: Go, take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel who is standing upon the sea, and upon the land.
066	REV	010	009	And I went to the angel, telling him to give me the little book. And he saith to me, Take it, and eat it up; and it will make thy stomach bitter, but in thy mouth it will be sweet as honey.
066	REV	010	010	And I took the little book out of the angel's hand, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey; and when I had eaten it, my stomach became bitter.
066	REV	010	011	And it was said to me, Thou must again prophesy concerning many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings.
066	REV	011	001	And there was given me a reed like to a staff, a voice saying: Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship therein;
066	REV	011	002	but the court which is outside the temple, leave out, and measure it not, for it hath been given to the gentiles; and the holy city will they tread under foot forty-two months.
066	REV	011	003	And I will give power to my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and sixty days, clothed in sackcloth.
066	REV	011	004	These are the two olive-trees, and the two candlesticks, which stand before the Lord of the earth.
066	REV	011	005	And if any one designs to hurt them, fire goeth out of their mouth, and devoureth their enemies; and if any one designs to hurt them, he must in this manner be killed.
066	REV	011	006	These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of their prophecy; and have power over the waters, to turn them to blood, and to smite the earth with every plague, as often as they will.
066	REV	011	007	And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that cometh up out of the abyss will make war against them, and will overcome them, and kill them.
066	REV	011	008	And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where their Lord also was crucified.
066	REV	011	009	And some from among the peoples, and tribes, and tongues, and nations, will look upon their dead bodies three days and a half, and will not suffer their dead bodies to be put into a tomb.
066	REV	011	010	And they that dwell upon the earth will rejoice over them, and make merry, and will send gifts to one another, because these two prophets tormented those who dwelt on the earth.
066	REV	011	011	And after three days and a half the spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon those who saw them.
066	REV	011	012	And they heard a loud voice from heaven, saying to them, Come up hither; and they went up into heaven in a cloud; and their enemies beheld them.
066	REV	011	013	And in that hour there was a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell, and in the earthquake were slain seven thousand men; and the rest became afraid, and gave glory to the God of heaven.
066	REV	011	014	The second woe is past; behold, the third woe cometh quickly.
066	REV	011	015	And the seventh angel sounded, and there followed loud voices in heaven, saying, The kingdom of the world is become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and he will reign for ever and ever.
066	REV	011	016	And the twenty-four elders, who sat before God on their thrones, fell upon their faces, and worshipped God,
066	REV	011	017	saying, We give thanks to thee, O Lord God Almighty, who art and who wast, because thou hast taken thy great power, and hast reigned.
066	REV	011	018	And the nations were enraged, and thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead to be judged, and to give the reward to thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and to them that fear thy name, the small and the great; and to destroy the destroyers of the earth.
066	REV	011	019	And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and the ark of his covenant was seen in his temple; and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunders, and an earthquake, and a great hailstorm.
066	REV	012	001	And a great sign was seen in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars;
066	REV	012	002	and being with child she crieth out, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered.
066	REV	012	003	And another sign was seen in heaven; and behold, a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads seven diadems;
066	REV	012	004	and his tail dragged the third part of the stars of heaven, and cast them to the earth. And the dragon standeth before the woman who was about to bring forth, that when she hath brought forth he may devour her child.
066	REV	012	005	And she brought forth a man-child, who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron; and her child was caught up to God, and to his throne.
066	REV	012	006	And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared by God, that they should nourish her there a thousand two hundred and sixty days.
066	REV	012	007	And there was war in heaven; Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels,
066	REV	012	008	and prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven.
066	REV	012	009	And the great dragon was cast down, the old serpent, called the Devil and Satan, who deceiveth the whole world; he was cast down to the earth, and his angels were cast down with him.
066	REV	012	010	And I heard a loud voice in heaven, saying, Now is come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ; for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, who accused them before our God day and night;
066	REV	012	011	and they conquered him because of the blood of the Lamb, and because of the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives, even to death.
066	REV	012	012	Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the earth and the sea! for the Devil is come down to you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.
066	REV	012	013	And when the dragon saw that he was cast down to the earth, he persecuted the woman who brought forth the man-child.
066	REV	012	014	And to the woman were given the two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.
066	REV	012	015	And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a river, after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away by the river.
066	REV	012	016	And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed up the river which the dragon cast out of his mouth.
066	REV	012	017	And the dragon was enraged at the woman, and went away to make war with the rest of her offspring, who keep the commandments of God, and maintain the testimony to Jesus.
066	REV	013	001	And I stood upon the sand of the sea. And I saw a beast coming up out of the sea, having ten horns and seven heads, and upon his horns ten diadems, and upon his heads names of blasphemy.
066	REV	013	002	And the beast which I saw was like a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion. And the dragon gave him his power, and his throne, and great authority.
066	REV	013	003	And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed. And the whole earth wondered after the beast.
066	REV	013	004	And they worshipped the dragon, because he gave the authority to the beast; and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like to the beast, and who is able to make war with him?
066	REV	013	005	And there was given to him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemy; and power was given to him to work forty-two months.
066	REV	013	006	And he opened his mouth in blasphemies against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and those who dwell in heaven.
066	REV	013	007	And it was given to him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them; and power was given him over every tribe, and people, and tongue, and nation.
066	REV	013	008	And all who dwell on the earth wilt worship him, every one whose name hath not been written in the book of life of the Lamb that was slain from the foundation of the world.
066	REV	013	009	If any one hath an ear, let him hear.
066	REV	013	010	If any one [[leadeth]] into captivity he shall go into captivity; if any one shall kill with the sword, he must be killed with the sword. Here is the endurance and the faith of the saints.
066	REV	013	011	And I saw another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spoke as a dragon.
066	REV	013	012	And he exerciseth all the authority of the first beast in his presence; and causeth the earth and those who dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.
066	REV	013	013	And he doeth great signs, so that he even causeth fire to come down from heaven on the earth, in the sight of men.
066	REV	013	014	And he deceiveth them that dwell on the earth, by reason of the signs which it was given him to do in the presence of the beast; commanding those who dwell on the earth to make an image to the beast which had the wound by a sword, and lived.
066	REV	013	015	And it was given to him to give breath to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should even speak, and cause that all who did not worship the image of the beast should be killed.
066	REV	013	016	And he causeth all, the small and the great, and the rich and the poor, and the flee and the bond, to receive a mark on their right hand, or on their forehead;
066	REV	013	017	and that no one shall be able to buy or sell, except him that hath the mark, the name of the beast, or the number of his name.
066	REV	013	018	Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast; for it is the number of a man, and his number is six hundred and sixty-six.
066	REV	014	001	And I saw, and lo! the Lamb stood on Mount Zion, and with him a hundred and forty-four thousand, having his name and the name of his Father written on their foreheads.
066	REV	014	002	And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of loud thunder; and the voice which I heard was as that of harpers, harping with their harps.
066	REV	014	003	And they sing a new song before the throne, and before the four living creatures and the elders; and no one was able to learn the song but the hundred and forty-four thousand, who were redeemed from the earth.
066	REV	014	004	These are they who were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These are they who follow the Lamb wherever he goeth. These were redeemed from among men, a first-fruits to God and to the Lamb.
066	REV	014	005	And in their mouth was found no falsehood; for they are without fault.
066	REV	014	006	And I saw another angel flying in mid-heaven, having an everlasting message of good tidings to proclaim to those who dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and tribe, and tongue, and people;
066	REV	014	007	saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him, for the hour of his judgment is come; and worship him that made the heaven, and the earth, and sea, and fountains of waters.
066	REV	014	008	And another, a second angel, followed, saying: Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, which hath made all the nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.
066	REV	014	009	And another, a third angel, followed them, saying with a loud voice: If any one worship the beast and his image, and receive the mark on his forehead or on his hand,
066	REV	014	010	the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation, and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the angels, and in the presence of the Lamb.
066	REV	014	011	And the smoke of their torment goeth up for ever and ever; and they have no rest day or night, who worshiped the beast and his image, and whoever receiveth the mark of his name.
066	REV	014	012	Here is the endurance of the saints, who keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.
066	REV	014	013	And I heard a voice from heaven, saying, Write, Blessed are the dead, who die in the Lord from henceforth. Yea, saith the Spirit, that they shall rest from their labors; and their works do follow them.
066	REV	014	014	And I saw, and lo! a white cloud, and upon the cloud one sat like to a son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.
066	REV	014	015	And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him who sat on the cloud, Thrust in thy sickle, and reap, for the time to reap is come, because the harvest of the earth is ripe.
066	REV	014	016	And he who sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle upon the earth; and the earth was reaped.
066	REV	014	017	And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle.
066	REV	014	018	And another angel came out from the altar, who had power over fire; and he cried with a loud cry to him who had the sharp sickle, saying, Thrust in thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, for the grapes of the earth are fully ripe.
066	REV	014	019	And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered the fruit of the vine of the earth, and cast it into the great wine-press of the wrath of God.
066	REV	014	020	And the wine-press was trodden outside the city, and blood came out of the winepress, even to the bits of the horses, to the distance of a thousand six hundred furlongs.
066	REV	015	001	And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvelous seven angels, having seven plagues, which are the last, because in them is completed the wrath of God.
066	REV	015	002	And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire, and those who had gained the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over the number of his name, standing at the sea of glass, having harps of God.
066	REV	015	003	And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying: Great and marvelous are thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are thy ways, thou King of the nations;
066	REV	015	004	who shall not fear, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for thou only art holy; for all nations shall come and worship before thee, because thy judgments are made manifest.
066	REV	015	005	And after these things I saw, and the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened;
066	REV	015	006	and the seven angels who had the seven plagues came forth, clothed in pure shining linen, and girded about the breasts with golden girdles.
066	REV	015	007	And one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden vials, full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever.
066	REV	015	008	And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power; and no one was able to enter the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels were completed.
066	REV	016	001	And I heard a loud voice out of the temple, saying to the seven angels, Go, and pour out the seven vials of the wrath of God upon the earth.
066	REV	016	002	And the first departed, and poured out his vial upon the earth; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men who had the mark of the beast, and who worshipped his image.
066	REV	016	003	And the second poured out his vial into the sea; and it became blood, as of a dead man, and every living thing died, that was in the sea.
066	REV	016	004	And the third poured out his vial into the rivers and fountains of waters; and they became blood.
066	REV	016	005	And I heard the angel of the waters saying, Righteous art thou, who art and wast holy, because thou hast judged thus;
066	REV	016	006	for they shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast given them blood to drink; they deserve it.
066	REV	016	007	And I heard the altar saying, Even so, Lord God Almighty! true and righteous are thy judgments.
066	REV	016	008	And the fourth poured out his vial upon the sun; and it was given to it to scorch men with fire;
066	REV	016	009	and men were scorched with great heat. And men blasphemed the name of God, who had the power over these plagues; and they repented not, to give him glory.
066	REV	016	010	And the fifth poured out his vial upon the throne of the beast; and his kingdom became darkened; and they gnawed their tongues for pain,
066	REV	016	011	and blasphemed the God of heaven, because of their pains and because of their sores; and they repented not of their deeds.
066	REV	016	012	And the sixth poured out his vial upon the great river, the Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of the kings who are from the rising of the sun might be prepared.
066	REV	016	013	And I saw come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits like frogs;
066	REV	016	014	for they are the spirits of demons, working signs, which go forth to the kings of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God l Almighty.
066	REV	016	015	Behold, I come as a thief; blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, that he may not walk naked, and his shame be seen.
066	REV	016	016	And he gathered them together into the place called in the Hebrew tongue, Harmegedon.
066	REV	016	017	And the seventh poured out his vial upon the air; and there came forth a loud voice from the temple, from the throne, saying, It is done.
066	REV	016	018	And there followed lightnings, and voices, and thunders, and there was a great earthquake, such as there was not since there was a man upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, and so great.
066	REV	016	019	And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell; and Babylon the great was remembered before God, to give to her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.
066	REV	016	020	And every island fled away, and no mountains were found;
066	REV	016	021	and there came down from heaven upon men a great storm of hail, every stone weighing about a talent; and men blasphemed God on account of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great.
066	REV	017	001	And there came one of the seven angels who had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying, Come hither; I will show thee the judgment of the great harlot that sitteth upon the many waters;
066	REV	017	002	with whom the kings of the earth committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth were made drunk with the wine of her fornication.
066	REV	017	003	So he carried me away in the Spirit into the wilderness. And I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet-colored beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.
066	REV	017	004	And the woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand, full of abominations and the impurities of the fornication of the earth,
066	REV	017	005	and upon her forehead a name written: MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF THE HARLOTS AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.
066	REV	017	006	And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus. And when I saw her, I wondered with great wonder.
066	REV	017	007	And the angel said to me, Wherefore didst thou wonder? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carrieth her, which hath the seven heads, and the ten horns.
066	REV	017	008	The beast which thou sawest, was, and is not, and is to come up out of the abyss, and goeth into perdition; and they that dwell on the earth, whose names have not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, will wonder, when they see the beast, that he was, and is not, and yet will come.
066	REV	017	009	Here is the mind that hath wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth.
066	REV	017	010	And they are seven kings; five of them are fallen, one is; the other is not yet come, and when he hath come, he must remain a short time.
066	REV	017	011	And the beast that was, and is not, he is an eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into perdition.
066	REV	017	012	And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, who have received no kingdom as yet, but receive authority as kings one hour with the beast.
066	REV	017	013	These have one mind, and give their power and authority to the beast.
066	REV	017	014	These will make war with the Lamb; and the Lamb will overcome them, because he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they who are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful.
066	REV	017	015	And he saith to me, The waters which thou sawest, where the harlot sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.
066	REV	017	016	And the ten horns which thou sawest, and the beast, these will hate the harlot, and will make her desolate and naked, and will eat her flesh, and will burn her up with fire.
066	REV	017	017	For God hath put in their hearts to do his will, and to form one purpose, and to give their kingdom to the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled.
066	REV	017	018	And the woman which thou sawest is the great city, which reigneth over the kings of the earth.
066	REV	018	001	After these things I saw another angel coming down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory.
066	REV	018	002	And he cried with a strong voice, saying: Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, and is become a habitation of demons, and a hold of every unclean spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird;
066	REV	018	003	for all the nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth became rich out of the abundance of her luxury.
066	REV	018	004	And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues;
066	REV	018	005	for her sins have reached to heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities.
066	REV	018	006	Requite her even as she requited, and render to her double according to her works; in the cup which she mixed, mix to her double.
066	REV	018	007	As much as she glorified herself and lived luxuriously, so much torment and mourning give her. For she saith in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no mourning;
066	REV	018	008	therefore in one day shall her plagues come, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be burned up with fire; for strong is the Lord God who judged her.
066	REV	018	009	And the kings of the earth who committed fornication and lived luxuriously with her shall weep and lament for her, when they see the smoke of her burning,
066	REV	018	010	standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas, the great city! Babylon, the mighty city! for in one hour is thy judgment come.
066	REV	018	011	And the merchants of the earth weep and mourn over her, because no one buyeth their merchandise any more;
066	REV	018	012	merchandise of gold and of silver, and of precious stones and of pearls, and of fine linen and of purple, and of silk and of scarlet; and all citron wood, and all manner of vessels of ivory, and all manner of vessels of most costly wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble;
066	REV	018	013	and cinnamon, and amomum, and odors, and ointment, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and cattle, and sheep; and merchandise of horses and chariots and slaves; and souls of men.
066	REV	018	014	And the fruits that thy soul desired are departed from thee, and all thy dainty and splendid things are perished from thee, and thou shalt find them no more.
066	REV	018	015	The merchants of these things, who became rich by her, shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping and mourning,
066	REV	018	016	saying: Alas, alas, the great city, that was clothed in tilde linen and purple and scarlet, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls!
066	REV	018	017	for in one hour so great wealth is made desolate. And every pilot, and every one that saileth to any place, and mariners, and as many as trade by sea, stood afar off,
066	REV	018	018	and cried out when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What city is like the great city!
066	REV	018	019	And they cast dust on their heads, and cried out, weeping and mourning, saying: Alas, alas, the great city, whereby were made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her wealth! for in one hour she is made desolate.
066	REV	018	020	Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye saints and ye apostles and ye prophets! for God hath avenged you on her.
066	REV	018	021	And a strong angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall Babylon the great city be thrown down, and shall never more be found.
066	REV	018	022	And the sound of harpers, and of musicians, and of pipers, and of trumpeters shall be heard in thee no more, and no craftsman, of whatever craft, shall be found any more in thee, and the sound of a millstone shall never more be heard in thee,
066	REV	018	023	and the light of a lamp shall shine no more in thee, and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard in thee no more; for thy merchants were the great men of the earth; for by thy sorcery were all the nations deceived.
066	REV	018	024	And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of all that have been slain upon the earth.
066	REV	019	001	After these things I heard as it were a loud voice of a great multitude in heaven, saying, Hallelujah I The salvation, and the glory, and the power, belong to our God;
066	REV	019	002	for true and righteous are his judgments; for he hath judged the great harlot, who corrupted the earth with her fornication, and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand.
066	REV	019	003	And a second time they said, Hallelujah! and her smoke goeth up for ever and ever.
066	REV	019	004	And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshipped God that sat on the throne, saying, Amen, hallelujah!
066	REV	019	005	And a voice came forth from the throne, saying, Praise our God, all ye his servants, and ye that fear him, the small and the great.
066	REV	019	006	And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunders, saying, Hallelujah! for the Lord our God the Almighty reigneth.
066	REV	019	007	Let us rejoice and exult, and we will give to him the glory; for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready;
066	REV	019	008	and it was given to her that she should be clothed in fine linen, shining and pure. For the fine linen is the righteousness of the saints.
066	REV	019	009	And he saith to me, Write, Blessed are they who are called to the marriage-supper of the Lamb. And he saith to me, These are the true words of God.
066	REV	019	010	And I fell at his feet to worship him; and he saith to me, See thou do it not; I am a fellow-servant of thee, and of thy brethren who maintain the testimony to Jesus; worship God. For the testimony to Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.
066	REV	019	011	And I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse, and he who sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war.
066	REV	019	012	His eyes were a flame of fire, and on his head were many diadems; and he had names written, and a name written which no one knoweth but he himself;
066	REV	019	013	and he was clothed with a garment dipped in blood; and his name is called, The Word of God.
066	REV	019	014	And the armies which are in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and pure.
066	REV	019	015	And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he may smite the nations; and he will rule them with a rod of iron; and he treadeth the wine-press of the fierceness of the wrath of God Almighty.
066	REV	019	016	And he hath on his garment and on his thigh a name written: KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.
066	REV	019	017	And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the birds that fly in mid-heaven, Come, gather yourselves together to the great supper of God;
066	REV	019	018	that ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of those who sit on them, and the flesh of all men, both free and bond, lieth small and great.
066	REV	019	019	And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him who sat on the horse, and against his army.
066	REV	019	020	And the beast was seized and he who was with him, the false prophet who wrought the signs in his presence, with which he deceived those who received the mark of the beast, and who worshipped his image; the two were cast alive into the lake of fire burning with brimstone.
066	REV	019	021	And the rest were slain with the sword of him who sat upon the horse, the sword which proceeded out of his mouth; and all the birds were glutted with their flesh.
066	REV	020	001	And I saw an angel coming down from heaven, having the key of the abyss, and a great chain in his hand.
066	REV	020	002	And he laid hold of the dragon, the old serpent, which is the Devil and Satan, and bound him a thousand years,
066	REV	020	003	and cast him into the abyss, and shut him up and set a seal over him, that he may deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years are ended: after that he must be loosed for a short time.
066	REV	020	004	And I saw thrones; and they sat on them, and judgment was given to them; and I saw the souls of those beheaded on account of the testimony to Jesus, and on account of the word of God, and of all who had not worshipped the beast, nor his image, and had not received his mark upon their forehead, or upon their hand; and they lived, and reigned with Christ a thousand years.
066	REV	020	005	And the rest of the dead lived not until the thousand years were ended. This is the first resurrection.
066	REV	020	006	Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection; on these the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.
066	REV	020	007	And when the thousand years are ended, Satan will be loosed out of his prison;
066	REV	020	008	and will go out to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to the war, the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.
066	REV	020	009	And they went up upon the breadth of the earth, and encompassed the camp of the saints, and the beloved city; and fire came down out of heaven, and devoured them.
066	REV	020	010	And the Devil who deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where are also the beast and the false prophet; and they will be tormented day and night for ever and ever.
066	REV	020	011	And I saw a great white throne, and him who sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away, and no place was found for them.
066	REV	020	012	And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and books were opened; and another book was opened, which is the book of life; and the dead were judged out of the things written in the books, according to their works.
066	REV	020	013	And the sea gave up the dead which were in it, and death and the underworld gave up the dead which were in them; and they were judged each one according to his works.
066	REV	020	014	And death and the underworld were cast into the lake of fire; this is the second death, the lake of fire.
066	REV	020	015	And if any one was not found written in the book of life, he was cast into the lake of fire.
066	REV	021	001	And I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea was no more.
066	REV	021	002	And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.
066	REV	021	003	And I heard a loud voice out of the throne, saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them, their God;
066	REV	021	004	and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall mourning, nor crying, nor pain he any more; for the former things are passed away.
066	REV	021	005	And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he saith, Write; for these words are faithful and true.
066	REV	021	006	And he said to me, All things are accomplished. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. To him that thirsteth I will give of the fountain of the water of life freely.
066	REV	021	007	He that overcometh shall inherit these things, and I will be his God, and he shall be my son.
066	REV	021	008	But the cowardly, and unbelieving, and the polluted with abominations, and murderers, and fornicators, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all the liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone; which is the second death.
066	REV	021	009	And there came one of the seven angels who had the seven vials filled with the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come hither; I will show thee the bride, the wife of the Lamb.
066	REV	021	010	And he carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God,
066	REV	021	011	having the glory of God; her light was like to a most precious stone, as it were a jasper stone, clear as crystal;
066	REV	021	012	having a wall great and high; having twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel;
066	REV	021	013	on the east, three gates; and on the north, three gates; and on the south, three gates; and on the west, three gates.
066	REV	021	014	And the wall of the city had twelve foundation-stones, and on them the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
066	REV	021	015	And he who talked with me had for a measure a golden reed, to measure the city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof.
066	REV	021	016	And the city lieth four-square, and its length is as great as its breadth. And he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs. The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.
066	REV	021	017	And he measured the wall thereof, a hundred and forty-four cubits, according to a man's measure, which is that of an angel.
066	REV	021	018	And the material of its wall was jasper; and the city was of pure gold, like to clear glass.
066	REV	021	019	The foundation-stones of the wall of the city were adorned with all manner of precious stones: the first foundation-stone was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald;
066	REV	021	020	the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprasus; the eleventh, hyacinth; the twelfth, amethyst.
066	REV	021	021	And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; every several gate was of one pearl. And the street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass.
066	REV	021	022	And I saw no temple therein; for the Lord God Almighty is its temple, and the Lamb.
066	REV	021	023	And the city hath no need of the sun, nor of the moon, to shine upon it; for the glory of God lightened it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.
066	REV	021	024	And the nations will walk by the light of it; and the kings of the earth bring their glory into it;
066	REV	021	025	and the gates of it shall not be shut by day, for there will be no night there;
066	REV	021	026	and they will bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it.
066	REV	021	027	And there shall not enter into it anything unclean, or that worketh abomination and falsehood; but only they that are written in the Lamb's book of life.
066	REV	022	001	And he showed me a river of water of life, clear as crystal, coming out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.
066	REV	022	002	Between the street of the city and the river, on one side and on the other, is the tree of life, hearing twelve kinds of fruit, and yielding its fruit every month; and the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations.
066	REV	022	003	And there shall be no more curse; and the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and his servants will serve him;
066	REV	022	004	and they will see his face, and his name will be upon their foreheads.
066	REV	022	005	And there will be no night, and no need of lamp or light, for the Lord God will shine upon them; and they will reign for ever and ever.
066	REV	022	006	And he said unto me, These words are faithful and true; and the Lord God of the spirits of the prophets sent his angel to show to his servants what must shortly come to pass.
066	REV	022	007	And behold, I come quickly. Blessed is he that keepeth the words of the prophecy of this book.
066	REV	022	008	And I John am he who heard and saw these things; and when I had heard and when I had seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel who showed me these things.
066	REV	022	009	And he saith to me, See thou do it not; I am a fellow-servant of thee, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of those who keep the words of this book; worship God.
066	REV	022	010	And he saith to me, Seal not the words of the prophecy of this book; the time is at hand.
066	REV	022	011	He that is unjust, let him be unjust still, and he that is filthy, let him be filthy still; and he that is righteous, let him do righteousness still, and he that is holy, let him be holy still.
066	REV	022	012	Behold, I come quickly, and my reward is with me, to give to every one according as his work is.
066	REV	022	013	I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.
066	REV	022	014	Blessed are they that wash their robes, that they may have a right to the tree of life, and may enter by the gates into the city.
066	REV	022	015	Without are dogs, and sorcerers, and fornicators, and murderers, and idolaters, and whoever loveth and practiseth falsehood.
066	REV	022	016	I Jesus sent my angel to testify these things to you for the churches. I am the shoot and the offspring of David, the bright morning-star.
066	REV	022	017	And the Spirit and the bride say, Come! And let him that heareth say, Come! And let him that thirsteth come! Whoever will, let him take the water of life freely.
066	REV	022	018	I testify to every one that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any one shall add to them, God will add to him the plagues that are written in this book;
066	REV	022	019	and if any one shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his part from the tree of life, and out of the holy city, which are written of in this book.
066	REV	022	020	He who testifieth these things saith, Yea, I come quickly. Amen; come, Lord Jesus!
066	REV	022	021	The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all.
